Maybe then, over two or six generations of consistent mental and emotional tuition, we could train our monkey, territorial minds to develop beyond alpha and beta and tree swinging courtship and social orders. It would have to be intensive though, to asuage the millions of years of evolution that still fall just short. I think we are nearly there though, hence society and so called gender identity is soup and at at sea. Cultural breakdown, disposessed, deranged and troubled youth and adults. The old people are almost glad that they are out of it, though they envy the excitement of the technology. Marx, like other special thinkers since the dawn of time may not have been completely accurate in their vision, but their function was to demonstrate a vision and change the amoebe vision. Other such legendary figures include crazy messiahs with huge egos, debateably Christ, Buddha, Mohammed, not to mention the first person who worked out how to use a tool rather than break your fingers, the first person who lit a fire and remembered how to do it and did it a second time and of course, the first monkey that actually, self taught, swam in the ocean. Equality is the absolute virtue. If we had that as a given, as a human mindset, imagine what would happen next...if you can evolve beyond that point. No offence meant, I am the same as you and on the same plane, except hey, what's wrong with developing happy inclusive emotions?|`|TWMUXDhKaa	They don't want true equality, what they want is to not have to work.

It should, unless you're a Marxist. <br>  <br>  Our Founding Fathers believed in equality, and set it forth as one of the most important virtues of our nation. Who the hell are you to decide it's not a worthwhile ideal? If you don't like the idea of equality, move to a country that doesn't embrace equality as a virtue. Communist China sounds about right, no?<br>  <br>  And what the hell is fimiton on about? He sounds completely insane.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the idea that "all men hold equal stating in life" is not what the idea of "equality" means. That IS Marxism. equality simply means that everyone is given the freedom and equal opportunity to achieve what they are CAPABLE of achieving. It does not mean that we should all be set up to equal stations in life. Is that what you thought it meant? No wonder you're confused.<br>  <br>  The Founding Fathers put that in the Declaration of independence because it was a treatise to King George. Each of our them was stating that THEY, and ALL MEN, are equal in worth to the King of England. Our society has evolved to recognize that if they were equal to a king, then the son of an ex-slave is equal to a white man, and a woman is equal to a man. Equal in worth, and worthy of equal consideration. As for equal opportunity, is a natural consequence of those ideals. These ARE the principles our country was founded on. <br>  <br>  BTW, John Locke, like the Founding Fathers, was a Deist. There wasn't a lot of 'theism' in his writings.

That's what the news likes to put out there because it gets good ratings. However there is more black violence in the black community then any would want. Most is due to the lack of a family structure in the household. Too many single parent families. Also once again the media and entertainment makes this way of life (Thug Life) seem interesting.

Don't ask why: it wasn't my choice that this was the main focus of my childhood upbringing.  As life went on, this as often provoked attack as it did cuddling.  Being a male did not help.<br>  <br>  Eventually, after one such onslaught had cost me yet another broken nose, a dislocated shoulder, a girlfriend, and more damage to my reputation and moral well being than I care to detail -- I wound up in a psychologist's office.<br>  <br>  Detailing the most recent story and some others like it from the past, and especially how my looks, character, and approach to life resembled a harmless rabbit, (a childhood nickname from my mother, by the way); I anticipated the usual question and said, "I did nothing to cause this!"<br>  <br>  The psychologist was wise, and said something I always remembered and that for once I was actually able to put to use. She smiled gently and said:<br>  <br>  "You know, I think if you were realistic you'd have to admit that there is a lot about rabbits and the way that rabbits act, which is VERY attractive to snakes."|`|JdYVmsNaaa	That last Superman movie came out a couple years back, and I didn't find it particularly memorable. I remember a bullet bounced off Superman's eye, and I remember the elderly man in front of me was still fast asleep after the credits started rolling, and I, in a an "e-whale" moment, frightened my friend by suggesting he had passed away right there in the theater. <br>  <br>  But what I remember most clearly, is how much my friend loved the movie. I was bored, and there she was raving about it. "Isn't it great to have a movie where the hero has no tragic downfall, no twisted character! How refreshing!" On and on.<br>  <br>  I admit, I tend to make friends with women who have excessively read Jane Austen (Is that possible?) and women who would be shocked if they ever realized I only nod and smile along at their recounting of Oprah, and in fact don't know what at which time or on which channel Oprah can be found. Still, in spite of my friendships, I've always had Batman leanings. I prefer to wade right into the mud pit of Humanity; to me, it's always been an attractive mess. Superman was always too good, too powerful, and far too "jock" for my tastes. <br>  <br>  But lately, I can understand the attraction. I haven't seen a film all year that wasn't damned depressing. They're all entrapment and self-injury, heartbreaking nobility and dreams that were illusions. Can't someone grab Hollywood by the collar and shake some life into it? <br>  <br>  Seriously, the sheer willfulness required to turn one's entire existence into a tragedy is unfathomable even to a stubborn person like me. You know I love the Bard, but Romeo permanently destroyed two families for a girl he'd known a week? I mean, really? What a selfish bastard! <br>  <br>  We were speaking earlier of dogs who have an innate ability to pierce to the core, and to make Humans look like emotional dullards in the process. We have this notion that innocence goes hand in hand with blindness, or an unsculpted mind, but here are creatures so clever, and yet so selfless. Let's try to be more doglike, darn it! If only the world were full of TRUE bitches!<br>  <br>  It's all very well that we have an evolutionary desire to protect the "cute", but we also have a vast emotional need of it. We need that secret belief in innocence tucked away in our hearts. We need to believe in love and peace. We need truth, justice, and the American way. It's those beliefs that keep Humanity in Humans.<br>  <br>  I still love the confused tangle of people and all their disarray, but the World needs a little more innocence. It needs a visit to the Merry Old Land of AWWWWW!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8scEMMeU1c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8scEMMeU...</a>|`|AA10246871	First, a comment in regard to the video clip.<br>  <br>  Morris, in 1995, said there was a reason why "cute" creatures have those features. Biologically, that's true. But it would seem from a biological standpoint, that he missed something about what Lorenz said back in 1949. Neurobiologists know, and have known for a long time, that the adult human response to those types of features also include chemical and electrical responses in the brain. Women's responses tend to be quicker, and sometimes slightly stronger, but men have them, too. (The men with the weakest responses are men who have never been around children at all. Even men in societies where men do not take part in childrearing have strong responses.) Those responses can be seen in blood tests and also on PET scans. You cannot tell me that a biological response like that just suddenly started happening to humans sometime between 1949 and 1995. Logic would dictate that it's something which has evolved in our bodies over thousands upon thousands of years. We could argue for years about which man is right, but the one thing which it makes no sense to argue about is that the "emotion" we feel when we see "cute" is accompanied by a biological reaction, as well. <br>  <br>  As for your question proper, have you ever noticed that there are plenty of things which are cute but not innocent, and which aren't particularly attractive? Take a child who is spoiled. They may look attractive at first glance, but the minute they open their nasty little whiny mouth, their attractiveness factor drops to somewhere well below zero. Generally we like to blame parents for behavior like that. Similarly, children who are older, but not particularly cute are tremendously attractive when they are innocent. What I am saying is that your question actually seems to be asking about two different attributes: innocence, and the cute factor.<br>  <br>  I am willing to go with the biological reason for the response to cuteness, regardless of which man you side with, because I know from research that we are hard-wired to find it attractive.<br>  <br>  The innocent bit is a lot more interesting to me, simply because we aren't hard-wired to find innocence attractive. If we were, it would either make pedophiles more common, or make them go away altogether. I think we are attracted to innocence because it is, by its nature, transient. That's probably why it is also something we value. Let's be really honest: life is hard. There are a lot of things we run into in life which we would probably rather not encounter: pain, both emotional and physical; disappointment; fear; unfairness; extreme ugliness; I could go on for a long time..., but you see where I am going. I think we like innocence because it inspires in us a powerfully wistful nostalgia for a world where there was no pain, no fear, no disappointment, and nothing truly ugly on our personal horizon. It's attractive because it's a state we remember fondly, and may even desire. And it's attractive because once it's gone, there's no way to get it back. It's like a very beautiful rose--part of the beauty we perceive comes, I think, from knowing that its time is limited, that the petals will eventually wither and fall. <br>  <br>  There is one other interesting thing about innocence. While it is attractive and desirable, I think as we get older, if we are lucky, we discover that we must let it go if we are to grow as people. Every single experience in my life which has really made me grow in the ways which matter has included a loss of innocence of some sort. As much as I miss my innocence, I wouldn't give up the experiences which have taken it from me. What they have left, in exchange, is a different kind of gift: a well-developed soul and a lot of hard-won knowledge. I'm not saying what I have is particularly beautiful, but to me it is precious.|`|IAXhu2tuaa	Evolution. There may have been babies that were not cute which were not taken care of and did not make it to breeding age.

Staying in Iraq and making Iraqis hate us? It is due to our unfair foreign policies that these supposed "enemies" exist. Iran always wanted to be left the hell alone, but they have felt for a long time that the USA has been hypocritically supporting Israel in its campaign to control the region. <br>  <br>  As to Afghanistan, did anyone ever stop to think that people began having major problems with the Taliban because they were destroying the poppy fields and stopping one of the largest heroin exports in the world? <br>  <br>  Its time for the USA to protect itself and stop poking our nose where it doesnt belong. We need to stop playing favorites, and instead play fair, and whoever wants to attack us while were playing fair, can then be considered an actual enemy. <br>  <br>  Nobody gives a sh*t about how Americans live their lives, as long as Americans do not presume to teach anyone else how they should live their lives.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	At this point, I seriously doubt that they're planning another attack, or at least that we wouldn't have found out about it already.

AA11209233	That's a tough question, because if America were 100% capitalist I'd want socialist reforms, and if it were 100% socialist I'd want capitalist reforms and incentives.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to make me pick one of those, I'll pick socialist.  Everything may not run as great, but at least everyone who works gets a living.  There is no such guarantee with capitalism--you could work all day without making enough to live on, much less raise a family.  Now that I've said that, I think that an ideal economy would be worker-friendly capitalism.  A capitalist society that ensures that employers don't take advantage of the fact that employees can't just change their jobs because they think they aren't treated fairly, and one that doesn't let companies (from overseas or lawbreakers) who don't play by the rules participate so that the solution never becomes 'buy from someone who underpays their workers'.  <br>  <br>  Things work better if we don't worry too much about profits or feeding the starving.  If we try to take care of everyone, there isn't enough to go around and some people just don't deserve help because they don't help themselves.  If we leave everyone on their own, there is nothing to stop the rich from enslaving the workers like they did in the past in American coal towns and other similar situations.  So a little balance, tipped a bit toward the capitalist side, is probably what would help us most.|`|J3REXSldaa	socialist
4jUqOBWZaa	Your observation does not equate to the facts. And it ignores choices by Men. It is almost laughable Feminist propaganda. Rutgers University's Marriage Project is well researched, peer reviewed and has hard data. <br>  <br>  Truth is Men are avoiding marriage, Striking and refusing it in record numbers. And those who marry, are doing so later in life. Then there are those American Men who choose to marry Foreign Women, further reducing the pool of available quality candidates. <br>  <br>  When you subtract Men in Prison, Men on disability, Men who are married, Striking Marriage and avoiding Marriage the pool shrinks a great deal. The latest data shows 22% of Men refuse to ever Marry. I have a Nephew in this situation and a Cousin who has never been married.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Why is it a shock to ppl if a woman chooses to be single, but not if a guy chooses it? If you like your career, you have friends, you have hobbies that you enjoy and companionship, why would you need to marry? unless you want to have kids? I can't believe that ppl are suggesting to have kids so you're not alone in your old age..I thought you had kids because you enjoy raising them, not so they can be your caretakers in your old age and so you have someone to hang onto before you kick off!  <br>  <br>  And this stuff about after 30 women are desperate! It depends on the men and women. In my 40's I started dating and the men seemed pretty desperate to me. I didn't care if I got into a permanent relationship or not, I'd just gotten out of one, but for plenty of men in their 40's and 50's, their goal was marriage and I avoided them like the plaque. I'm now in a relationship, but I'm not going to have kids at age 50, and don't see why I should marry at this stage if I'm not religious or care about traditions. <br>  <br>  Maybe the women some ppl know are desperate at age 30, but obviously they would hang out with ppl who need marriage to make them feel better, like they do.|`|AA10494763	Honestly I don't think they choose it but it chooses them.  At least the women i know.  They get a degree and a good job all while having dreams of marriage and babies in their head they put off dating so they can focus on school. They get that big cooperate job and men don't want them anymore.  Many men are intimidated by women with big jobs. They don't feel like they have anything to offer. On the flip side the women only want men on their level.  They don't want a 35 year old with no degree that works in factory that they will have to support. They want a man who their equal (education income etc.) They have a lifestyle they like and want to maintain it after marriage.  YOu can't go to Europe everyday if your man is unemployed but you can pay for yourself to go or if your man makes as much as you.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	It's better for them.

Does single mean not in a relationship or simply not married?  Fewer people are getting married at a young age--its far more common to get married in one's late twenties.  However, that doesn't mean a woman is without a significant other in her life.  Personally, I'm in my late twenties and I'm not married although I'm in a long standing relationship with a wonderful man.  Marriage isn't everything.  As for children--well, children simply aren't for everyone.  And someone shouldn't have children just because "its the thing to do" or because people say "you'll regret not having them."|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Many women do choose to remain single because they can. They do so because they do not care to give up their independence, and the freedom of a life lived for themselves. <br>  <br>  Put simply, men have not kept pace with women's societal progression and until they catch up they may be perceived as a burden to women who want a relationship based on equality and mutual respect.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	What's so great about never having a family, never having children and dying alone with no one to miss you? Your parents, siblings will die, friends come and go, only a few friends have a bond with a person like they are blood. When has loneliness ever been so glorified... being alone is "liberating" and "independent"? <br>  <br>  I think people in the West take too long to grow up and mature. By the time they are fully mature they are in their mid 30s. Men can do things later in life even if they die earlier, I think women who put off things until their 30s and 40s are doing themselves a disfavor unless they truly are looking to live their lives alone. I see it a lot, women who say they want to be free and have the single life and not settle... until they are in their 30s. Then they start to get desperate.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Feminism has been promoting the destruction of the family for a long time, and with activism to get women more perks over men, many women are now falling for the selfishness of feminism.<br>  <br>  Instead of learning to share, love, and other positive qualities, they're adopting the feminist 'qualities' of "it's all about me" and "I can have it all".|`|NNHdkLDWaa	1.

They then discovered they could actually work for themselves and they grew stronger and challenged men for top jobs, thus grew independance. Now that women are comfortable with that independance they realise that they can actually be happy on their own and don't have to be married to be happy. Before all women had to look forward to was family life and menial work, the horizons have grown and so has women's expectations and desires. They are now realising how good men have had it for years and they like it! Just my theory and is certainly true to a degree in my case - although I am happily married.|`|f0a3d59262cb942ba6463d8c525a1cd8aa	Contrary to your appraisal of the facts, dating agencies & websites are massively on the rise indicating beyond question that both men & women want a life-partner as much as ever. <br>  <br>  Some answerers here have made good points e.g. why would either gender marry when it is now commonly deemed acceptable to take the benefits of marriage without making a commitment i.e. the sex.  No one however has mentioned this: since women entered the work force, 70% of jobs in the service industry are now occupied by women.  Now, given that women value and judge prospective partners according to their job/financial status, it is obvious that in taking these jobs they have made vast numbers of the male populace unattractive to them.<br>  <br>  Thus, I don't believe that women *are* choosing a single life.  Rather they start out following their gonads, living according to the pleasure principle only, enjoying all the fun of moral-free, casual sex, until, BY CHANCE, a lucky few wind up in something stable, while increasing numbers find, as they age and lose their looks, that they can no longer compete as they once did in the casual sex scene (whereas older single men can keep playing because women don't select sex partners predominantly on looks) or find themselves landed with a child.  At this point they claim that their position has been a matter of choice (rather than admit they played a losing game).<br>  <br>  As for 'many of them choosing not to have children', I don't know what society you're looking at.  The numbers of single mothers has been growing year on year.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I don't think you can say being single is better than being married and vice versa.  Different things work for different people.<br>  <br>  I don't believe more people are choosing to stay single.  Gone are the days where women had to choose between a career and getting married.  Having said that there is more and more pressure for women to do it all and excel at it all i.e. have a high powered job full time, be a full time mother and wife as well.|`|qb7gjCbiaa	I like the feeling of Independence.

Happiness is about having meaning and love in life. Career and family are just means to it.<br>  <br>  "Career parents" are parents who identify their lives with work accomplishment, professional development and advancement. "Working parents" are both career and non-career people, who spend time away from the home for reasons of work.|`|AA11589988	If men really ever had it all it was because their wives made it possible by being full time mothers! <br>  So that means if a woman wants to have it all too then she needs to have a stay at home husband. For most families of average income where both parents choose to or have to work it's a case of muddling through trying to juggle career and family and maybe not being a big success at either.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Yes. Life is about making choices and sacrifices. Give up one thing to have another.<br>  <br>  If you want kids, good for you. Just make sure YOU actually raise them and not a teacher or day care worker. By "you" I refer to the parents. Either one of them. If you can't afford to do that, then you shouldn't have kids because that would be selfish.|`|ZWePAEZUaa	Yes.|`|FL67UPPHaa	You can't have a full time career and be a full time parent at the same time. Even if you can balance them well, it's not possible to contribute fully to both. A child can still have a good relationship with a working mother, and spend time with her on weekends and evenings, but she isn't around to actually raise the child on an everyday basis. <br>  <br>  Unless both parents need to work, then I think they should work as a team with one person caring for the home and children and the other providing an income. It doesn't matter which parent takes which role -- a woman can have a full time career, as long as her husband stays at home with the kids. <br>  <br>  The needs of the children come before the wants of the mother, and if both parents work it's the kids who will be missing out. I find it strange that so many women want to work -- my dad has always hated his job, and he'd happily give it up and spend more time with his family if he could. Family life is so valuable and irreplaceable I can't understand why anyone would throw it away for the stress of employment.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	I'm going to take the time to back keypointist up on this one.  Essentially what we have in the nuclear family is a division of labor.  Not because women or men aren't good at something or are . . . but because things need to be done.  <br>  <br>  Admittedly, it was natural for our species upon becoming industrialized that the woman stay at home while the man leaves to return with means for support, since men were typically the hunter/forager/warrior types to begin with, and women have the physiological necessities to feed infants.  Now that we live in industrialized society, our biological assets are less key, and this offers up a larger degree of freedom.  That's fine, but if you have a child, you should have someone to take care of it.  Sure it used to be the mother, now it can be the father, but in today's ego driven world, if you truly "have it all", it is often a nanny--which both parents must work full time in order to afford.   <br>  <br>  Modern society gives us the luxury of a conscious decision to have a child, so people do not want children until they are ready or want children for themselves--with the full intent of not having to sacrifice anything for it. Ultimately, a child is not a possession for you to "have", it is a human being . . . and this outlook is reprehensible, regardless of sex.|`|zIpbIWb3aa	"It seem men have been having it "all" (career and family) for some time now"<br>  <br>  That comment is so full of fail that I don't know where to begin. For starters, quality women usually aren't attracted to unemployed guys that live in their mothers basement. The more wealth, power or status a man has, the more negotiating power he has in attracting a higher quality mate, someone that cooks, cleans, ETC. For men, a career is a means to an end to attract and care for what he truly desires. <br>  <br>  Time away from his woman or his child so he can make the money to care for them is one of the most severe sacrifices a man makes. If you spend to much time at work and your wife is unwilling to be empathetic, then she may leave you and take your baby with her and feel justified in doing so because as far as she's concerned you chose work over her. If you don't spend the hours necessary at work then you won't make as much money, and we all know finances are the leading cause of divorce in the western world. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. <br>  <br>  Anyone that thinks that men "have it both ways" and that women are the only ones that have to struggle with balancing family and career are grasping at straws to play the victim card.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	It would be easier to "have it all" if work or family were more flexible, but both are equally demanding. It is an idealistic notion to "have it all" and not be stressed, spread too thin, exhausted and weary. The economic realities of life for most people don't give most much of a choice... they "have it all" without wanting it all.<br>  <br>  I think it's very elitist and sheltered of feminists to still use the arguments from the 60s/70s today. The middle class is facing heavier burdens and is shrinking, the quality of life is decreasing for most, the economy is changing... yet feminists still have these ideas that are relevant only to middle class/upper middle class women from the 60s/70s. It's like Marie Antoinette saying "Let them eat cake"...|`|nvH62xo5aa	if by "family" you mean children, then they'll think that if she is away at work all the time, she is not raising her children. or that she will give her child over to a day care center while she is away working.<br>  <br>  however, a family does not have to include children. a family is a group of people who love each other. :]|`|ndopqX6Taa	Wanting it "all" is a subjective term.

There's nothing sadder than an older woman who gave up her career for her children and now finds herself with nothing to do all day. Her children are now in school or grown up and moved out. Her husband works all day so she's pretty much home alone for most of the time.<br>  <br>  Women in general live longer than men do. Telling them to stay home and to give up working is not going to provide for them in their old age. They won't be paying into Social Security for all those years and in this day of decreasing job security, they can't rely on their husband's pensions either. Many of them will end up having to move in with their children or if they don't have children, live in a place for old people.|`|zGvcNgTtaa	I don't think there's any shame in wanting both a family and a career. I know I want both for myself. I think it's because women are seen as the main or primary caregiver in the home and people feel threatened that if you take the woman out of the home and she has both family and a career she will not be able to keep up with both and therefore will neglect one or the other. I think having both can be accomplished. I just think women have to be careful and not neglect one or the other. Women shouldn't have to choose though, they shouldn't have to choose between having a family or having a career. It's not right, like you said, men have had both for a long time now and as long as you can multitask and be good at both things then you should go for it. Some women may feel drawn more to stay at home and raise a family, as other women are more drawn to having a good solid career and put all their time and effort into that and ever more increasing women are doing both just fine right now.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	No its not. Its harmful to the rights of both gender to think that. It assumes that women are the only ones who really want and only ones who are really capable of raising children. This means that when a man and woman do have a family the woman is the one who must engage with children all the time. This hurts men too, because in the event that a family is broken up as they are rightfully allowed to in these times it is often in the eyes of juries and the law that fathers are not capable of raising children. While children must be cared for ant its better that they are raised by their parents rather than a childcarer this doesnt mean that the woman should automatically be saddled with all the childcare.

This is not the 70's when women had the option to work or stay home. I think it is more of a danger to the family if they are not having their financial needs met.|`|ZJIDUFgpaa	What's wrong with wanting a career and a family? I know plenty of people who manage both.<br>  <br>  Why is it normal for men to want it, but wrong for women to desire it?<br>  <br>  This is a double standard.<br>  <br>  "So really, what's the difference between a man being a working or career father, and a woman being a working or career mother?"<br>  No difference. One is male, the other is female. It just goes to show how sexist people are. They think the male is normal, the female is over-ambitious.|`|067132ba5f0e39af8fe338df72999099aa	The difference is in traditional gender roles.  For men, having a career and a family simply meant coming home and enjoying the family that his wife was raising for him.  He didn't really have to participate a lot in the day-to-day tedium of child-rearing.  When women started to have careers, they were still expected to do the majority of housework and child-rearing as well.  The impossibility and "danger" comes from one person taking on too much responsibility - no person can DO it all, even if he/she HAS it all.  <br>  <br>  Recently more men have become involved in household responsibilities, making it easier for women to have careers and do other things outside the home.  The key is sharing responsibility - BOTH partners in a relationship need to be committed to creating an environment where everything gets done and helping each other do it.  I have a sister and a best friend who have excellent careers outside the home, and both of them have/had men in their lives who took on primary childcare responsibilities at times when the woman's career made it necessary.  It works, if everyone's on board. <br>  <br>  Single parenting is a whole different story, and that's just damn hard.  It's hard to do anything by yourself......<br>  <br>  Finally, the selfishness is a perception/balance issue.  My personal belief is that kids need positive role models, which includes seeing their parents enjoy life.  Kids need a reason to believe that growing up, becoming responsible and starting their own families are good, fun goals.  Seeing your mom have a great life will make you want that also.  Selfish?  Not if Mom isn't neglecting the kids.
z60J0Z9Daa	Ummm...it's called day care.<br>  <br>  It's not like mothers leave the toddler alone for 8 hours.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	How old are these children?

I have never been in trouble with the law nor do I do drugs or got into any kind of trouble while my parents weren't there.  My mom went back to school when my brother was 12 and I was 13.  I also have a couple of friends that were latchkey kids and they are doing pretty well for themselves.  Just because you can give an example of kids getting into trouble when by themselves doesn't mean all kids in that situation will do the same.|`|nvH62xo5aa	If the children are over 14, they can be left home alone for a couple of hours if she doesn't get home until, say, dinner time. However, if the children are 13 and under, they should be with a neighbor, with a family member, or close family friend. I don't believe in day care, unless it is absolutely necessary.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	My brother and I weren't left unattended at home until we were old enough to be trusted not to burn the house down.

They don't do it by choice. They have to work because they don't have the luxury of staying home. Besides, why should something like this be totally the woman's responsibility? Where is the father in all this? Isn't it his responsibility to be more to his family than simply a paycheck and a sperm donor? Why is it all right for him to work long hours and have his career come first but it's somehow "selfish" if women do it? A lot of children suffer as a result of fathers who ignore them or are always too busy to spend any time with them.<br>  <br>  Another thing that should be mentioned is that women need to be made aware of the very real risks of they give up their careers for their families. There's always the chance of divorce, abandonment, illness, injuiry, and death. Then when they are older, they find that re-entering the job market isn't nearly as easy as they thought it would be. A lot of companies aren't interested in hiring older women, especially if they have been out of the workplace for years and have no real marketable job skills. It's pretty boring to have to sit in an empty house all day.|`|e66f1ef8d569cc63ffe5d9474c957b12aa	It depends if she has to work so her husband and her can afford to pay their bills, or if the woman is a single mother ect, or if she is just working so she doesn't have to care for them, ect.

My mother went back to work, I was nine, my brother was 11 and we came home after school and cared for ourselves. I can't say it was the perfect scenario, but we were raised to stay out of trouble. Neither of us have been in jail.<br>  <br>  You speak of this wage gap like it is a universal reality. Say the mother is an educated career woman and her husband is a trade worker. You would find that the woman will earn more. The wage gap only applies if the male and female are in comparable careers with comparable education.|`|XKk101Kqaa	It's irresponsible for BOTH parents to work full-time while having kids.<br>  Either the mom stays or dad OR..<br>  I think the best way to solve this dilemma is to have both parents work part-time while ensuring one of them is always home with the children.<br>  <br>  BTW, the wage gap is only applicable to the same exact job with the same exact responsibilities.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	It depends on the situation and the ages of the children.

My mother left us home during the summer while she worked full time. I was 12 and my sisters were 9 and 6. I had to go to daycare until I turned 12 and I hated every minute of it. I had to take on a lot of responsibility watching my sisters but it was so worth it to be home. I don't think it's negelct for a mother to work full time and leave her children home as long as their old enough to take care of themselves and eachother. Essentially the mother is trying to better the lives of the children by working full time to be able to give them everything that she can. Plus my mother was not the type of mother that was always hugging and kissing us, I think it was actually better to have her at work instead of at home feeling trapped with us, which would have been much worse for us!|`|XIbct4fuaa	Its illegal to leave a young child (under the legal age in whatever state you are in) at home alone.

However, the same can EASILY be said of a father.  Is it irresponsible for a married father to work full-time, since he leaves his children unattended at home?<br>  <br>  Having children takes two individuals and, as a result, it take TWO individuals to raise them.  So either the attending and domestic care is split 50/50, or one parent stays home.  Of course this doesn't mean it HAS to be the mother, either.  It would have to be a decision the two made together.<br>  <br>  Why is it always the mother's responsibility to care 100% for the children when it takes two to have a child?<br>  <br>  EDIT--There's a wage gap in certain jobs, but not between different professions.  So a woman doctor DOES make more than a man nurse, for example.  So as a professor (when I get there), I'll make more money than my man, who is a secondary education teacher.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	What if they can't survive on just the husband's income? What if she was the main breadwinner before the baby?<br>  <br>  Not all husbands make more than their wives... <br>  <br>  Those babies could be left with grandparents or other family, with a babysitter, or at daycare.. I doubt they are alone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: So married responsibly = married for money.. now I thought that was what you guys hated in women.. Why would you ever tell someone they should marry for money.. that is crazy.  You should marry for love, not to have someone "support" you.. not everyone is into being a "trophy wife".<br>  <br>  Why did you not offer that in the cases I provided, that the father stay home.. since he made less?

JLwGzIYuaa	It is just a relative analysis driven by your own definitions and categories. Try not to think about generations as a static nature with set values and believes. Rather think about social and demographic conditions of groups that may give the illusion of clusters.<br>  <br>   A generation is not defined by itself with clear boundaries but by the commonalities you want to use to label a group of people. For example, the “baby boomer generation” only makes sense by labeling all the kids who were born during the Second World War in North America, but do they share the same type of values and believes?<br>  <br>  They were just labeled by the media and marketers and that is what makes them a generation. The reality is that demographically, we only have a large population getting close to the retirement age. That for sure groups them into common social and economical problems but that’s all.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|QI9zF9Xqaa	stop cheating do your own work who agrees with me come on|`|pfisYml0aa	grey beards vs. pubes? well greybeards have experience, but then again pubes feel no pain....toughy.......WHAT AREW YOU TALKING ABOUT!!!!????!?!?!?!

At the company I work for, you pretty much have to demand and beg to get your raises or reviews, so therefor the women tend to get paid less because they won't demand and beg to the bosses like the men will.<br>  <br>  Women who step up and do the same, will almost always benefit from it like men do.<br>  If you are denied equal pay, it's most likely because you aren't doing equal work. It depends on what you asked for when you got hired too. If you started out lower than others in the company, you will always get paid less.

Just like some men get unequal pay to other men for the same amount of work and some black men make more than other white men for the same amount of work. Labor markets are dynamic. If a firm hires 1 woman at $40,000/year, and over the next year the dynamic of the labor market changes substantially, he may have to pay $60,000 for the 1 man he hires next. If the woman is satisfied with her position, she may choose to stay making $40,000/year. Or she could voluntarily leave or ask for a raise.<br>  <br>  "Equal pay" as described is basically a command economy (i.e. communist economy) as far as the labor market goes because it requires the government to set wages (or at least guarantee that they comply with their opinion of what they should be).|`|nPHCPX1Xaa	nowhere, its an imagined injustice.......typical feminist fantasy

In a loving relationship, BDSM is just fun. It is necessary to follow safety guidlines so someone doesn't get hurt, but it can be very enjoyable. <br>  <br>  That being said, if you do have underlying issues with sexual abuse, rape, or abuse it can trigger the feelings and go from pleasurable to fearful very quickly. That is the other reason for safety guidelines such as a safe word or gesture that will tell teh other person to stop immediately. Personally I have used redlight, yellowlight, greenlight successfully. The word/gesture needs to be something you can easily remember and that you would not normally say or do during that time.<br>  <br>  As far as the psychology world is concerned there is no consensus about this issue.

As long as a person's alive you and they have hope that things will change.  Very few people want to be addicts all their lives and most get help at some point.  IF a person's dead you can never change the relationship good or bad.  My youngest daughter's father is an alcoholic if he were dead there would be no hope for her to ever get to know her father as a father and as someone how loves her. ( he does it's just that no one ever showed him how to show it) As long as he lives there is the hope that he'll get help and that they can have a good relationship as she and he get older.  IF he dies she'll always think that he abandoned her and that he didn't love her, that would never be able to change with him dead.  So as someone who's lost siblings, husband and boyfriend to death I would say that death is worse.  When some one dies all hope of change dies with them.|`|0gGBw4Ceaa	I say change.

This is often misleading because when compared to the average body size of each species, modern Homo sapiens have a proportionally larger brain, even if the Neanderthal brain is physically larger.[7] Endocasts point toward Neanderthal dominance on the cerebral, indicating the right and left spheres of the brain were specialized, in line with modern humans. [8] <br>  A relatively large face that is forwardly situated and characteristically has midfacial prognathism, as if it is being pulled forward by the nose. <br>  Cheekbones are swept back behind a large and open nasal cavity. They feature triangular peninsulas of pone that project into the nasal opining from both sides, increasing the surface area on mucus-producing membranes that, research suggests, aide in warming and humidifying the cold and dry air associated with the tundra environment of Neanderthals. [9] <br>  On the rear of the skull is what is commonly referred to as an "occipital bun" where an increase in bone surface area allows for more muscle attachment. It is at this point where certain neck muscles anchor into pits, the supeainias fossae. This adaptation leads to increased power in the neck and shoulders. <br>  Large, double arched bony brow ridges above the orbits. The brow ridges are functionally linked to the retracting forehead, as the forehead becomes less and less vertical, the brow ridges become necessary in order to absorb the heavy stress generated in the face during chewing. <br>  Dentition: Specialized chewing apparatus  Cranium and mandible from Shanidar Cave displaying classic Neanderthal characteristics.Very large incisors with reduced size in the rest of the dentition, also evidence of scraping animal and plant material against front teeth, leading to heavy wear. [10] This labial wear has been hypothesized to be due to Neanderthals holding animal hides in their teeth while cutting, scraping or processing them. <br>  Upper incisors built up by ridges on the side, "shovelled" or described as shovel shaped. [11] <br>  Taurodont post canine dentition resulting in an enlarged pulp cavity and fused roots that are not independent of one another. <br>  The back teeth often have additional cusps and taurodont ("bull-toothed") roots [12] produced by a delayed turning-in of the roots during dental formation. This results in the molars being poorly or only slightly separated from each other.[13] <br>  Very powerful musculature for a forwardly placed jaw. Increased mastoid tuberosity where temporal muscles attach on each side of the skull towards the rear of the braincase. The posterior temporal muscles aide in the use of the front teeth, hypothesized to increase productivity of scraping with the front teeth, thought to be very important to Neanderthal culture. <br>  A retromolar gap between M3, the last molar, and the ascending mandibular ramus, the extension of the jaw bone. <br>  A bony prominence next to the mandibular foramen, the hole that admits the mandibular nerve from the brain. This relates to the attachment of the sphenomandibular ligament which suspends and rotates the lower jaw, playing a role in stabilizing a large jaw during muscle actions. <br>  -Large shoulder and elbow joints <br>  -Large and wide rib cage <br>  -Long clavicle <br>  -Wide scapula with more muscle attachments at the rear <br>  -Bowed and short forearm leading to a strong gripping hand with wide fingertips. <br>  -Wide hips with an outwardly rotating, large hip joint <br>  -Rounded, curved and thick-walled femur shaft <br>  -A relatively acute angle between the shaft and neck of the femur when compared to modern Homo sapiens <br>  -Large and thick patella (knee) <br>  -Short and flattened, thick-walled tibia <br>  -Large ankle joint <br>  -Wide and strong toe bones <br>  <br>  Unlike all of these features which follow a trend of increased muscle attachment and wider bones, the superior pubic ramus, the upper-front part of the pelvis, is much more gracile than expected. Being relatively long, thin and flattened, it had been suggested that it may have increased the birth canal to assist a small bodied mother birth a large headed infant, the large brain size needing a longer gestation period. But since this feature is also found in male specimens, it is believed to have widened the pelvis at the front to assist in rotating the blades of the pelvis outward along with the hip joint|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Homo neaderthalis had a smaller brain capacity, Cro-Magnon had more sophisticated tools (made of bone and stone).

You just need a nice vacation. Try something new. I know girlfriends, video games, and smoking are all boring cliches. And who DOES want to study? You need some time to yourself to think. Please arrange a vacation. Hope you feel better.|`|3pqWRz71aa	Hi... You are going through a rough time but do not worry God would not give u problems you cannot face. This is just probably a rough time and probably time will heal. Maybe when you start  feeling better about yourself you would be a stronger and more understanding person. You should probably pray more and know once God cares about you, no one has to. People around the world are probably going through worse and yet they still find ways to be contended and happy. Stressing about hating studying would do nothing... Study little by little besides a thousand miles begin with a single step.If you have to do many activities take off some from your list. If you do not past do not worry. It is ok if you have to repeat a year or so at ubiversity or if it is not possible to repeat and you have to quit, do not worry... Many persons did not go to college and still find a way to make a living. Build your self confidence and anytime you make a mistake do not blame yourself. Anytime a sad thought come to your mind just shake your head... and then continue with what you are doing. Be happy with yourself... stress would not help anything. And when you have free time watch funny cartoons and I hear running is good way to ease stress. When you wake up in the morning just smile and write in a diary. <br>  <br>  Smoking will do more damage than help.<br>  <br>  All the best and do not give up on yourself.

Gender doesn't really have anything to do with deciding what is best for the family.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Exactly !|`|wkjncmHTaa	Because it's up to the couple to decide.

For example, of course I'm not going to be upset that a male doctor makes more than a female nurse.  Duh!  They're two totally different jobs!  Of course a professor makes more than a teacher.  However, my only problem is when two individuals are within the SAME job, with the same experience and performance, and yet the man gets paid more.<br>  <br>  However, gender does not mean one will make more than the other when it comes to career choices.  As a woman, I chose the profession of professor (or, who knows, maybe author!), which makes decent money.  If I marry a man who loves his job as a teacher, he makes less.  Its often about profession choices.<br>  <br>  EDIT--Fine, but I don't look nor believe in those stats.  Of course its ridiculous to say "men unfairly make more" just by looking at overall incomes.  Men tend to be in more positions of higher status and often are less likely to work part time jobs or jobs with more flexibility.  You can look at those stats all you want, but they mean nothing to me--the freedom of being an Independent Feminist.  I don't prescribe to a certain feminist dogma--I simply make my own choices, look up my own research, build my own thoughts and responses, etc.  <br>  <br>  That said, there are SOME jobs where men make more in the same profession (professor happens to be one of them) and I think that's unfair.  But as far as cross professions, its stupid and almost comical to look at raw data and not take into account the different professions.

Remember though, start off small and work your way up. You don't want to push yourself too hard otherwise it won't work.<br>  Good luck!|`|FLgDn3OTaa	I hate heights too!

AGrQp2qZaa	No, this is not schizophrenia. You are just daydreaming of a more rewarding situation,and that is normal, especially when you are sad. It is a way to cope. If you were schizophrenic you would believe the person was real. As long as you understand the difference between reality and imagination you are fine.|`|St6kmJ1laa	There are "postive symptoms"&& "negtive symptoms" in schizophrenia<br>  if you have 2 or more of these symptoms you should go talk to some 1..<br>  But then again thats just problaly a "comfort thought"<br>  <br>  <br>  Positive symptoms<br>  <br>  Positive symptoms are easy-to-spot behaviors not seen in healthy people and usually involve a loss of contact with reality. They include hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and disorders of movement. Positive symptoms can come and go. Sometimes they are severe and at other times hardly noticeable, depending on whether the individual is receiving treatment.<br>  <br>  Hallucinations. A hallucination is something a person sees, hears, smells, or feels that no one else can see, hear, smell, or feel. "Voices" are the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia. Many people with the disorder hear voices that may comment on their behavior, order them to do things, warn them of impending danger, or talk to each other (usually about the patient). They may hear these voices for a long time before family and friends notice that something is wrong. Other types of hallucinations include seeing people or objects that are not there, smelling odors that no one else detects (although this can also be a symptom of certain brain tumors), and feeling things like invisible fingers touching their bodies when no one is near.<br>  <br>  Delusions. Delusions are false personal beliefs that are not part of the person's culture and do not change, even when other people present proof that the beliefs are not true or logical. People with schizophrenia can have delusions that are quite bizarre, such as believing that neighbors can control their behavior with magnetic waves, people on television are directing special messages to them, or radio stations are broadcasting their thoughts aloud to others. They may also have delusions of grandeur and think they are famous historical figures. People with paranoid schizophrenia can believe that others are deliberately cheating, harassing, poisoning, spying upon, or plotting against them or the people they care about. These beliefs are called delusions of persecution.<br>  <br>  Thought Disorder. People with schizophrenia often have unusual thought processes. One dramatic form is disorganized thinking, in which the person has difficulty organizing his or her thoughts or connecting them logically. Speech may be garbled or hard to understand. Another form is "thought blocking," in which the person stops abruptly in the middle of a thought. When asked why, the person may say that it felt as if the thought had been taken out of his or her head. Finally, the individual might make up unintelligible words, or "neologisms."<br>  <br>  Disorders of Movement. People with schizophrenia can be clumsy and uncoordinated. They may also exhibit involuntary movements and may grimace or exhibit unusual mannerisms. They may repeat certain motions over and over or, in extreme cases, may become catatonic. Catatonia is a state of immobility and unresponsiveness. It was more common when treatment for schizophrenia was not available; fortunately, it is now rare.<br>  <br>  Negative symptoms<br>  <br>  The term "negative symptoms" refers to reductions in normal emotional and behavioral states. These include the following:<br>  <br>  flat affect (immobile facial expression, monotonous voice),<br>  <br>  <br>  lack of pleasure in everyday life,<br>  <br>  <br>  diminished ability to initiate and sustain planned activity, and<br>  <br>  <br>  speaking infrequently, even when forced to interact. <br>  People with schizophrenia often neglect basic hygiene and need help with everyday activities. Because it is not as obvious that negative symptoms are part of a psychiatric illness, people with schizophrenia are often perceived as lazy and unwilling to better their lives.<br>  <br>  Cognitive symptoms<br>  <br>  Cognitive symptoms are subtle and are often detected only when neuropsychological tests are performed. They include the following:<br>  <br>  poor "executive functioning" (the ability to absorb and interpret information and make decisions based on that information),<br>  <br>  <br>  inability to sustain attention, and<br>  <br>  <br>  problems with "working memory" (the ability to keep recently learned information in mind and use it right away) <br>  Cognitive impairments often interfere with the patient's ability to lead a normal life and earn a living. They can cause great emotional distress.|`|pcLOOgyqaa	baby just chill and enjoy every moment. if u feel comfortable with this guy then take it in a positive way. and try to use this feeling to make u comfortable. where is the problem
ApELEov7aa	When you heard from your first love, I am sure that it made you excited because part of you never let go of him. When dealing with relationships and love it gets very confusing. Maslow's hierarchy of needs shows that everyone wants/ needs to be loved and wanted. It feels good when you know that your ex wants you back, but you know you love Scott you have to trust in yourself that you made the right decision. Now for the passive aggressive part, its a behavior that can affect you by not following through with something that you wanted to, as if you failed to accomplish. If Scott is a great guy and loves you and your happy, there is no reason that you should abandon the good thing that you have going on. As for Patrick, it's great that he told you the truth but you have moved on in your life, maybe there will be something between you guys down the road. Take that into consideration and try to put your anger towards someone else, instead of the man that loves you.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	It's not your fault if you're on your period.

Guilliatt (1996a) implicates feminist groups "with an anti-male attitude that promotes an image of the inevitable male-parental hurt of female children, and that wishes to punish all men, especially the father figure" <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/~trauma/issues/1998-3/gow1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.massey.ac.nz/~trauma/issues/1...</a><br>  <br>  This hysteria has been promoted even by feminist leaders like Catherine McKinnon who wrote that the rate of incest and sexual abuse of girls under the age of 18 was 43% (McKinnon 1987, p.49).|`|BkleL3F4aa	Yes they should.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the false allegation is very common.

RihPWIfBaa	To dream that you are being chased signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity.  you may be running away from a primal urge or fear.  You may have an intense fear of needles, confrontation, and possibly small spaces.

AG9msdUDaa	It works really well for me, but I find it has to be very visual for it to happen. Like a few years ago when this new car came out that I liked, I went to the website and just had fun customizing it even though I couldn't afford it at the time. <br>  <br>  A few years later, I had this great job and I'd just gotten a raise so I decided to look at gently used cars. For some reason I went to the Honda dealership and from a great distance across the lot I saw this cute car, and I pointed at it and said "I want that one" even though I was too far away to make out any details on it. Can you guess where this is going? It turned out to be the Toyota I had customized on the web site a few years earlier. I wish I had saved it somehow to compare, but I think it was almost exactly what I had wanted.<br>  <br>  Another example is the house I own. I never thought about buying a house but, again just for fun, was looking online at some. Knowing this, a friend of mine actually sent me the listing for this house and I did send an email inquiry which was never answered. About a year later, when I really had decided to go after getting a home, there it was, still on the market. I got it for $95 000, and the next month, prices on houses doubled and tripled. It was truly amazing.<br>  <br>  Finally, when I was finishing up my university degree and thinking about my future I wrote out a goal that said "I want to have my student loans paid off by the time I am 30." A couple of years after owning my home I was really feeling the pinch from all my bills and decided to see what I could do about my student loans.

This is known as the diathesis-stress model whereby an individual may have a genetic predisposition to behave in a particular way but it is the influence of the environment that determines whether or not this behaviour will present. There is also research looking into epigenetics which suggests that environment may actually alter the expression of an individual's genes through the process of DNA methylation which determines which parts of a gene are accessible. (Brief overview but research on this can be found in lots of places).|`|NGrOwP9vaa	okay if a person is born with defaults, then this is obviously going to hinder how quickly they pick up behaviours.

For example, I believe it was sometime around the 40s, a mother gave birth to identical girl quadruplets and they all survived. The mother had schizophrenia so all of the children had the same percent probability of inheriting the disease. Although the girls were identical, the mother favored two of the girls and was cruel to the other two. The two girls that she treated poorly both started getting symptoms of the disease and were hospitalized at age 21. The two the mother favored, however, did not experience symptoms until much later.

No I don't ask anything about that in the first date as 'bkurt33' does.<br>  But I think 'Gold Digger' has a point there. Your premise is that women and men look for and have sex for the exact same reasons, so they would be willing to pay for sex given the exact same conditions. I do not buy that. I believe in gender equality not in sexual identity. For your premise to be true our "sameness" or "equity" would have to be a biological reality. It is not. Soliciting isn't the same "sickness" either as 'turquoisePrincess' seems to believe. So your question is meant to prove a fallacy.<br>  Equality should be a social reality.

856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Depression is caused by chemical imbalances of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and other important neurotranmitters in the brain which stabilize emotions. Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we can work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both medication prescribed by a Psychiatrist along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	Everything that you have thought of may have failed, but the services that provide therapy should know that this is the case so that they can try and find alternative ways to help you.<br>  <br>  It may also be that people need to help you with your life and help you cope or change environment.<br>  <br>  Keep troubleshooting until you find the solution, and get people to help you; for there is no other way to find that answer which you have just said you wanted.<br>  So you need to do exactly that<br>  <br>  CREED|`|MuQ72xobaa	I suffer from depression as well.

I know that using medications and other therapies usually only works for short periods of time.  Here are some of the things that has helped me deal with it long term.  One accepting that for me depression is a chronic problem.  Like my arthritis or my blood disorder. I had to learn to live with it.  I know that I have to stay in close contact with my current therapist. Since 1964 when I started with my first psychiatrist I've had quite a few. Some I've seen for as long as 5 years and others I've realized didn't work with my personality and ended therapy fairly quickly.<br>  I've been on and off a variety of medications over the years some worked longer than others some not at all.  I would have times when the depression would go into remission for as long as 5 years and other times when the depression would be so bad I could barely get out of bed.  I know that it's really hard, but life can be worth all of the work. I have three great girls who are doing well, I've had some really great relationships and now I have someone I love and who loves me.  I have great family support but most of all I know that despite everything I can live a good life and be happy.  It just means that I have to work harder than some other people.  Like someone with learning disabilites or someone with a physical disability. Just because it's harder doesn't mean that life can't be sweeter also. When there is Joy and happiness in your life it means a lot more because you understand that life isn't always this way.  You don't take things for granted like some other people might. You learn to cherish those who support you even more and you know who precious that can be. You'll have to fight to have a good life but it is possible and life can be sweet and good at the same time you deal with depression.

Equal opportunity simply means that no one is discounted for those reasons. <br>  <br>  Simple enough for you?<br>  <br>  Lol, higher IQ? Compared to whom?<br>  <br>  <br>  Who is being penalized? Your idea of a transference of advantages is a fallacy. Equal opportunity is possible when people are --only-- judged based on their merits, and are rewarded based on those merits. That is not Marxism, that's a meritocracy.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	There are only two ways to achieve 'Equality of Opportunities' : <br>  <br>  1. Raising the testing standards for women, so that they compete with men on a level playground.<br>  2.

All equal opportunity means (in theory) is that everyone has the same chance to fight like hell for what they want. Once the playing field is established you are free to use whatever AMAZING QUALITIES that your humble *** is privy to.<br>  <br>  PS: nope, you've misunderstood, my friend. equal opportunity, or a level playing field, is exogenous. you are endogenous...handicapping you would be antithetical to the idea of equal opportunity. equal opportunity means anyone can play, regardless of any personal characteristics. the winner, of course, is determined strictly on merit. in theory.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Equality of opportunity surely just means that anyone should be able to do anything of which they are capable.

I think the theory behind it is not so much to penalize the advantaged, but rather to boost the disadvantaged. I'm not saying to put them on the same level, but to open some doors or opportunity. Give a disadvantaged person the opportunity to some college, but don't penalize the advantaged one because he is smart enough to get into Harvard.  I don't get the second part though...how would IQ be evidence that you're white and heterosexual? It wouldn't...and therefore does not matter.<br>  <br>  Add: Well I agree with you, you shouldn't be accused of some ism to justify your advantages.  I think if we really wanted to create equality, we would aid the disadvantaged instead of dragging down the ones who are naturally more gifted.<br>  <br>  @ fimiton: during WWII, women took jobs traditionally held by men because men were out fighting. They didn't take them from anybody.  Opportunities are not created at the expense of someone else, it just introduces a larger pool of candidates.

Race is qualitative but it is not a qualification.<br>  <br>  <br>  Equality of opportunity means that people shouldnt be unduly disadvantaged because they cant afford a private school, because they are bullied out of school/work because of their gender, race, sexual orientation or because this person has a child. This means that people are given the resources they need to compete as equal partners in the workplace and school. In the first case this means offering a certain standard of education to all children from all classes, the second simple means counteracting bullying, the third means removing a disadvantage that others dont suffer so it doesnt effect the person whose natural abilities are better it simply makes sure all people have equal access to the resources to turn their advantage into oppurtunity.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Ah, so is this where we make outrageous claims about our abilities?

Equality is considering all people of equal worth and judging them based on their actions and abilities, not their colour, race, religion, sex or any other arbitrary label.|`|eK2nRJL3aa	"Equality of Opportunity" is not referring to the individual aspects of ourselves, it's referring to the conditions in which we live and are educated and employed. It means that predominantly white schools should not get more funding than schools which are not. It means that all students are taught from the same quality books, there are equal (or as close to equal as possible) teacher to student ratios despite your school district. It means that all neighborhoods have the same access to healthcare treatments and information and that the quality of such are equivocal. It means that minorities and those who have been and continue to be underrepresented are given the same chance as those who have not to find employment. That they have the same access to the services offered by financial instutitions. <br>  <br>  All of this has nothing to do with the fact that in some cases you MAY have an African American or a Hispanic American whose IQ is lower than that of a Caucasian American. It does mean that in spite of this, in spite of what neighborhood they are from, that they have the same access to the services that Caucasian Americans do and the same opportunity (hence, "Equality of Opportunity") to make use of these services.|`|hQSQx83Taa	I think the idea here, which you seem to be intentionally missing, is that no one should be locked out of a job solely because of their genitalia or the color of their skin.

We pull our handbags across our chest too and turn our backs when in close proximity to a strange male or an unnattractive male as we pass him. Essentially, if we feel insecure, we cover our sexual beacons/ organs. It is like a man covering his penis with his hand if he finds himself naked in a situation where he doesn't want to be or feels vulnerable. The action won't protect his genitals and it seems ridiculous, considering men piss together, shower together, unlike women who are even more self comparing and cruel. Yet his instinct, initially, is to cover/ hide/ protect them, if the situation demands it. Women cover their **** (interestingly not their genitalia, but then ours dont protude like a penis so our **** do so..) we cover them, like a penis. It is that simple.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	Yes, it is definitely an insecurity. just like when someone stands  but they have their arms crossed.

e2DEQ6Euaa	School is a mini-community. As kids enter this community, they are likely to learn from their seniors or peers about how to act. Since the POPULAR arrogant groups are so prominent and so hyped about, there are bond to be people who will want to follow in their foot steps, thus leading to the next generations of popular arrogant pricks. This pretty much goes for almost all the popular groups in school, such as jocks, drama queens etc. The unpopular ones are there because of their supposed lack of social skills, so there will always be that group as long as a handful of kids lack social skills.|`|afI03mJXaa	There are these groups because people allow these groups to create and then put so much attention towards them and those groups know it. So they believe they have the status of popularity. It has to do with how people choose to view people. Its sucks but that's how it goes for now at least.|`|kxleO480aa	This group is ancient. They ruled over our hunting days, lorded over our first farming villages and pushed us around with their ever-changing notions of "Rule of Law." When they no longer needed to hunt deer, they focused on sports. Man has a need to expose his skills. If he is fast, he will find a way to evidence his speed. If he is an excellent marksman, he will likewise find competitive targets. Sports were so in grained in the psyche of some civilizations that they were occassionally more important than fighting. For example, one of the earliest civilizations with trade-based division of labor are the Spartan Greeks. History will never forgive them for being late to the Peloponnesian War because of their silly Olympic Games.<br>  <br>  What does trade-based division of labor have to do with social stratification? Everything. There is a sharp transition in any civilization that passes from agrarianism to commercialism. The main difference lies in the skills of the common person to produce his own food. Once a person becomes so specialized at his specific societal function that he couldn't feed himself without it, that civilization has reached the stage of commercialism. Naturally when a society learns to control its food supply there are excesses. When there are excesses, there is trade. And when there is trade, there is wealth. And when there is wealth, there are rich people. <br>  <br>  Rich people don't perform labor. They are banned from it in most cultures. Privledge bloodlines are reserved for military, public office and, sometimes, priesthood. After the introduction of state, media and industry the measurement of wealth and popularity was drastically changed. The state brought real power. Media brought widespread celebrity. Industry brought standard of living, and ultimately conspicuous consumption. <br>  <br>  This is where we find the modern high school. When property is mass produced people tend to use it to expose their status. The most readily available example is designer clothes. This is almost purely conspicuous consumption. Anyone can wear a t-shirt, but only certain people can afford a t-shirt from G-Star. Something slightly less obvious (and certainly more recent) is digital technology. Try walking around with a Discman these days and see what kind of looks you get. iPod establishes that you are participating in the marketplace. The LEVEL of iPod that you own is also telling of your station.<br>  <br>  That said, as long as there is excess and property, there will be elitists.|`|9EgWyiNbaa	Get used to it coz its the same outside in the real world.

oVeGMNsLaa	1) Money. Money, money, money.  If you want lots of money, fast, porn is the only real, legal way to do it (without much risk of losing money, that is). And let's not forget that a lot of men and women enter the industry only once or a couple of times, when they're really in need of some quick fast cash.<br>  <br>  2) You're your own boss. There are a lot of people who dislike or cannot work for others in a simple 9-5 job; it kills their spirit. If you want to be in control of your life, porn (especially non-contract work) is great. You work when you want, when you need money. You get to be choosy about what you do. And that appeals to many people.<br>  <br>  3) Fame. There's a big contingent of people in the world who think there'd be nothing finer than being in the spotlight- loved, adored, known, talked about. And if you're fine with sex in front of others and with strangers, porn is a great way to become a big name with lots of exposure and adoring fans eager for pictures with you, your autographed pictures and movies, lots of fanmail expressing love, etc..<br>  <br>  4) A stepping stone to Hollywood. Even though crossover stars are rare, people still think it might be a good way to get some fame and exposure, not to mention that it's work in front of a camera, which sounds pretty good to a wannabe actress eking a life out on a waitress' salary. People often cite Sylvester Stallone's start in porn, or the current trend wherein fleeting stars reinvigorate their careers with "accidental" sex tapes.<br>  <br>  5) No other skills. Although I'd argue that porn is a lot of work (difficult/painful positions, learning how to look attractive when you don't feel like it, some degree of acting skills, etc.), it's quite true that it's still a job in which you can get work despite delivering a bad performance. And when you have no other practical job skills or are too lazy to want to work for minimum wage at a fast food restaurant or janitorial job, laying on your back to get screwed on film for cash is very easy and it's always an option for those who can't do anything else.<br>  <br>  6) It's hot for you. There are a lot of men and women who are naturally polyamorous, bisexual, kinky, and exhibitionist. They love sex, and they get off on being watched and having their sexual exploits filmed. They have no problem having sex with more than one partner, or more than their main partner. If you were like that, why in the world wouldn't you want to get paid for it? Doing something you love and making a livelidhood is a dream.<br>  <br>  7) You're good at it. There are some people who just seem made for porn- men who are well-endowed and who can last for forever, girls who can deep-throat or get fisted, who are very flexible, etc., etc.. If you're a tall athletic person, it's natural to gravitate towards basketball. And if you are a sexual dynamo, it's natural to seek out porn, where you'll do fantastic and make lots of money.<br>  <br>  8) Curiosity. Lots of people, especially those who only star in porn once, do it to satisfy their curiosity. They wonder what it's like, think it sounds cool or fun, or it's a fantasy that they want to fulfill. So they try it.<br>  <br>  9) Rebellion. Porn is viewed quite negatively, and so if you want to say "F*ck you!" to your parents or society, doing it certainly suffices. Lots of girls and guys try to rebel like this once they turn 18. And, of course, part of this is "acting out" in a negative manner to get attention.<br>  <br>  10) To have sexual experiences. I'll illustrate with a good example- I'm kind of interested in electrical play. But a personal TENS unit runs $200-$300, not to mention the various attachments and the fact that it requires some skill and practice to master it.  It'd take a lot of time and effort and money to get and try it, and what if I didn't like it?  All that for nothing.  So I could go that route, or I could go and star on Wiredpussy.com, where they have state-of-the-art equipment, experts in electrical play and safety, and they'll pay me to have this experience, to boot.  The same goes for a lot of porn- some women would like to try a gangbang or BDSM or something.  If you want to experiment and push the boundaries of your sexuality, porn is one option.<br>  <br>  And there are so many other reasons.|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	Because the audience is mostly made up of the opposite sex.

Many people didn't even consider the so-called "Woman Question" until around the Age of Enlightenment and the so-called "bluestockings."  The first serious work that actually dared to address the issue of women's rights was written in 1792.  It was entitled "A Vindication Of The Rights of Woman" by Mary Wollenstonecraft.  <br>  <br>  Yet, many people ridiculed the idea upwards into the early 20th century.  Even Queen Victoria, herself a reigning power weilding monarch was an anti-feminist...she referred to the idea as the "mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights'|`|NYU37jfGaa	Wherever you go in the world, and whatever period of history you look at, you will find that generally women are considered to be subordinate to men.<br>  <br>  I think it has its origins in physiological differences, men are generally wired to seek out dominant roles more than women are.<br>  <br>  And being considered subordinate to men did not mean that women were not expected to work, for most of history they were.  The idea that women never did anything except 'look after men and houses' seems to be a common misapprehension, but it is not true.  Women have always contributed substantially to the economy.  <br>  <br>  for most of history the majority of people were peasant farmers, and no farmer could survive without his wife's input.  Likewise most businesses in the pre-industrial era were family affairs, with wives and children contributing.  <br>  <br>  For example, consider Deborah Read Franklin, wife of Benjamin Franklin.  She managed all the family businesses, including the newspaper, acquired real estate and ran the office of Postmaster General while Ben Franklin was in Europe.  She expanded the Franklin print shop into were essentially franchises along the Atlantic coast and into the frontier.  The wealth created from her excellent management and business skills made it possible for Ben to live in Europe for extended periods of time.<br>  <br>  And this was normal in the pre-industrial era.  Women were working in all kinds of trades and businesses, giving support to their husbands, and often running businesses after their husbands died.  Life involved far more than just 'looking after men and houses'.<br>  <br>  And, if it comes to that, the business of looking after a house was a great deal more demanding than it is nowadays, without labour saving devices, and with many things having to be made at home that nowadays would be bought in shops.  Cloth production for instance was a major occupation of women up until the 18th century, and women would be expected to make their own butter and cheese, care for the poultry, brew their own ale (which most people drank instead of water), and make household items like soap and candles.  Women would sell their surplus produce at market.<br>  <br>  In short, the rigid divide between home and work, being being a housewife and having a career, which we think of as normal nowadays, was not normal for most of history.  I believe that it was the seperation of home and workplace that led to the burgeoning of the feminist movement, because a lot of middle-class women did not have enough outlet for their energies at home any more, since their world had become divorced from the world of business and of production. They had servants to do the housework, and no longer had an active role in business.  They needed an outlet for their energies.  <br>  <br>  Had the Industrial Revolution never happened, I don't believe the feminist movement would ever have happened, because women would have continued to be too busy to get involved in politics.<br>  <br>  another point to consider is that in most of the world, for most of history, men did not have 'equal rights' either.  For example, in the UK at the time of the Revolutuionary War, only about one man in ten had the vote (hence the bafflement of the UK government at the colonists demand for 'no taxation without representation' hardly anyone in the UK at that time had direct representation in parliament).  The franchise was not extended to all working men in town until 1868, and not to agricultural workers until 1889.  The concept of 'equal rights' whether for men or women, is a realtively recent one in world history.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	How can you assert that slaves never accepted that? Likely there were many that believed that they were born to be slaves and couldn't handle freedom. Especially when you go back as far as the Romans where slaves had been born into that life for many generations.<br>  <br>  An African who was kidnapped from his or her homeland and forced into slavery might be a little harder to convince.<br>  <br>  It's the same with women: for generations many have been taught that there role is to serve under men not beside them, and sadly many belived it. But again you can go back to ancient history and find women who didn't accept this.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	1. Being caring and wanting to look after house and home does not make you an anti feminist.  Believing that your life will never be more than rubbing your husband's feet is pretty extreme though.  <br>  <br>  2. I do believe some women were and are genuinely happy to love their husbands and do nothing but serve them, both physically and mentally.  However, more and more, women are discovering that they are fully capable of doing whatever they want, without having to apologize for it.  Same way some guys are easily whipped while others have their own opinions. <br>  <br>  3. Women did not necessarily believe they were inferior to men.  Many great historical battles were fought with the wives of great male leaders whispering in their ears.  Physically, average men are naturally 2.5x stronger than average women, so there's really no contest there. But mentally, many women are equal to many men.  However it didn't always benefit the women to announce their power.  That's more of a guy thing. <br>  <br>  4. Slaves DID often accept inferiority.  You could call it 'making the best of the situation', but may slaves lived their whole lives as slaves without lifting a finger to fight it.  Not all battles, however, are written in history books.  Many names have been lost.  <br>  <br>  There will always be a group of people that are made to feel inferior by a scared, group that is afraid of losing control/status.  But believing that you are inferior is completely different than those people putting you down.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Actually not all women did believe that, not at all. The feminist movement has had a long, long history. <br>  <br>  Some women to this day, however, still accept the thesis of "natural" inferiority because it's entrenched in religion. It's very hard to believe wholeheartedly in God, and in particular to accept every word of the Bible or other religious text, without swallowing all the rules about who is in charge of whom. For many women it's probably just easier to bow down, especially with humility being such an important concept in many religions.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	Men and women both have always been downtrodden and exploited by their 'betters', by those with power.<br>  <br>  There was once a rumour that America was training monkeys to run their production lines because they could literally get them to work for peanuts.

At least not by judging from the women I've known and from what I've read.<br>  <br>  Things were much different before feminism. Taking care of a home would take all day prior to hot and cold running water, dishwashers, washers/dryers, stoves etc. Never mind the caring for small children...<br>  <br>  So anyway, along came technology and all of a sudden housewives had much more time on their hands. Some of these women, like Betty Friedan, decided to spend their time complaining about men and painting sordid pictures of past injustice. Yada yada yada, we've still got a bunch of angry feminists.|`|IuP0ryOMaa	Why do you think woman believed they were inferior??  In America a woman has always played an important role in a marriage, in the past being the homemaer, raising children, etc.  They never thought they were inferior, but equally important, as the family would not run w/o them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now that women have equal opportunities as men do, it is men that want them to feel inferior.|`|1suTgWGoaa	They were not inferior, but they were more silent.<br>  Now they talk more than any living element in this existence.

Obviously, men took control as the rulers at the start (from our power-hungryness in the testosterone) but this became tradition obviously and was passed down. Until women finally said that they wanted equal rights and it was given to them.<br>  Maybe it was because women were happy with their place, or it was all they knew and did not have these larger dreams and wanted the men to cope for them (maybe seeing an easier life, or being told it was an easier life)|`|KS2v0T4Kaa	This was because from the times these women were little girls they were taught that their job was to look after their husband, children and household. While the slave children would have been told by other slaves that they are equal. Also, in that time everyone was religious so the bible was the law and the bible says that men are superior to women.|`|veufnjsNaa	its a mindset rooted deep into our brains from small devices of brainwashing.

Egypt was built along the Nile, Mesopotamia means 'between the rivers' (the Tigris and Euphrates) and the Harappan Civilization grew along the Indus River (from which we get the name 'India').<br>  <br>  River valley civilizations are farming civilizations that make good use of the rich farmland along the edges of a river.  They get water from the river and also use it for transportation.  They often develop very accurate calendars so they know when to plant and when to harvest, and they develop a religion with gods of the river, weather, etc. because those are the things that are important to them.  Often (certainly in these three cases) they do so well that they are able to trade excess crops for other things they need, and they develop art and literature and architecture.|`|YMN6q1Cgaa	Do your homework dude, what are you in 8th grade?? <br>  <br>   me too, I had that last semester.

T4JEgbocaa	According to evolutionary biology, which in this case I believe to be right:<br>  <br>  A man doesn't have a womb, and is able to walk away from his children before the children are born. (I'm not saying that a man actually *should* do this, but in practice, he usually can!) If some of his children die young, well maybe others will survive. Therefore, a man can maximise his genetic inheritance by having sex whenever the opportunity arises. <br>  <br>  Whereas, after mating, a woman has to put a greater investment into her children than a man does, in time, effort and resources, to ensure that each child survives. Therefore, she maximises her genetic inheritance by being choosey, and only linking her genes with the 'best' men. <br>  <br>  If the mother chooses the 'wrong' man, her child is less likely to survive, thrive and mate, and thus pass on the mother's genes to the next generation.<br>  <br>  Or to put it more briefly:<br>  Men fire grape shot, women fire canon balls.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question depends on what exactly is meant by 'sexual'. But if it means "inclined to have sexual intercourse with many different partners on many occasions", I believe that men are naturally more 'sexual'.<br>  <br>  Note<br>  This Answer originally appeared under the Question:<br>  "Are men socialized not naturally more sexual than women?"|`|V1MptCMiaa	I agree with you.  Except I don't know if it's because you were taught to be more sexual.  It's more society.

It's just not socially okay for a girl to have a bunch of sex.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	I don't think men and women are equally naturally sexual.

The social aspect is that men are often encouraged to have active sex lives, and are celebrated according to how many sexual partners they have had.  Men are also not punished for having a sex life the way women are.  However, biology has a lot to do with men's sexuality as well.  Men's hormones are quite different from women's hormones, so that can explain your theory, too.|`|T588vfJDaa	I disagree, we have very differnt biological make up.

Unless of course, they feel threatened.<br>  <br>  This makes me think that there may be someone in your life that is bringing you down, whether they are doing it quietly or maybe even out in the open. I'm thinking more along the lines of the second option, because someone brought forward a fear of yours, something you typically would not have stumbled across often. They laughed at your terror, and kept pushing it further, hoping for it to bite you and cause you real pain.<br>  <br>  Think about the people in your life and whether or not someone is pushing you around. If there is no one, the person in your dream could have likewise been a reflection of yourself, telling you to get out and do something.<br>  Because we all know, fear drives us 'out of the house'.
9EVcTnUWaa	This is what I've told my daughters especially the youngest one who's been bullied in school.  Part of respecting yourself means standing up for yourself.  IF someone cuts in front of you walk back where you were and say Excuse me but I was here first.  And stand your ground, unless they want to get physical with you you've made your point. IF they choose to get physical with you than you have a choice if you want to report them to the administration.  But until you respect your self others won't respect you and will always see you as a target. So even if you have to do it with friends and practise first.  You have to learn how to stand up for yourself.  Try doing it with friends until you're comfortable saying no and other things in front of someone than it will be easier when you have to say it to someone else.

It would have level 800 sq miles of land had it hit. <br>  <br>  According to the Australian news Web site Crikey, the asteroid is likely to be drawn in by Earth's gravity, meaning it may return for many more near misses in the future.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.html?maven_referralObject=3764216&maven_referralPlaylistId=&sRevUrl=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,503164,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.ht...</a>|`|lWqOTYvWaa	Yep, the end of the world is nigh.

And avoid alcohol as it can cause unrestful sleep, and heavy foods as it would make him feel uncomfortable lying down.<br>  <br>  2)  The bedroom should be made as dark as possible using heavy curtains as this will allow his brain to recognise its time to sleep. Temperature also is a factor and shouldn't be too warm. And the bed should be clean and comfortable.

The child is now 7 years old, so obviously the lady is cautious about her relationships. She has a job and can manage without a man if she so decides.

Children sometimes grow up in such families with the understanding that such an arrangement is normal. Dysfunctional families are most often a result of the alcoholism, substance abuse, or other addictions of parents, parents' untreated mental illnesses/defects or personality disorders, or the parents emulating their own dysfunctional parents and dysfunctional family experiences.<br>  <br>  Dysfunctional family members have common symptoms and behavior patterns as a result of their common experiences within the family structure. This tends to reinforce the dysfunctional behavior, either through enabling or perpetuation.

6NZamyGPaa	there's supply and demand. simply, the more supply, the lower the price, the less supply, more scarce, higher cost. More demand, higher price (vendors take advantage of the desire to have an item and boost up the price), less demand, lower price. those are the basiccccc things of economics.<br>  <br>  now, it is useful to know because you can graph this out, and where the two lines(supply & demand) intersect, is called the 'true market price'. and when demand goes higher, the intersect is raised higher up on the supply function, and the price goes up. and when demand goes lower, price drops but stays in proportion to supply. it helps to figure out a products true cost, so you don't get fooled when you think a price is good when it's actually 10$ more than the true market price.|`|6LrSfqsHaa	The demand function would look something like<br>  <br>  X^d(Px) = 200 - 2Px<br>  <br>  The quantity demanded is the value of x at a given value of Px.  The quantity demanded, in other words, is just the corresponding value to an input value where as the demand function is the generalized equation to find the quantity demanded.
xmvPyLYUaa	Here are some things you can try.<br>  <br>  1.  Try to find out if there is anything causing the change.  We always want to think the best about the people we love, but he is at a prime age for issues with drugs, sex, gangs, bullying, self-mutilation, and endless other issues.  Remind him often that you love him and that you're there to listen if he needs help.<br>  <br>  2.  In the meantime, try a reward/consequence system.  Rewards and consequences should not just be based on whether he raises his grades by the end of the semester.  He needs to be held accountable daily for behaviors that will help him improve his grades.  Communicate with his teachers to find out why he's failing and what he needs to do differently.  Then set up a system to find out whether he's making those changes consistently.  One thing that I've seen parents do with my students is set up a daily or weekly report.  The student is responsible for having each teacher sign a quick note with some y/n questions and a place for comments.  For each class, the teacher will circle y or n for questions like:  Did the student participate?  Does he have missing assigmnets?  Does he have homework?  There is also room for any teacher comments.  If the student brings the note home with good comments from teachers, there's a reward.  If the student brings home bad comments or doesn't get all teachers to sign, then those issues are addressed right away with consequences.  The rewards and consequences do not have to be elaborate.  (Some research suggests that small rewards work better in the long run.)  It could be as simple as giving more or less xbox time.<br>  <br>  3.  You also need to hold your brother accountable for habits at home that will help him succeed.  There should be a set time for homework every day.  Don't let him wait until late to start it.  (If you set up the report system above, you'll know whether or not he has homework.)  If he doesn't have a bed time/lights out time, you should set one now.  You don't want him sleeping in class because he was up til 2:00 playing games, surfing the net, watching TV, or texting friends.  Limiting the xbox is also a great idea.<br>  <br>  4.  The biggest trick is to get a system in place and STICK TO IT.  There's a good chance he'll fight you every step of the way, especially if he thinks there's any chance that you (your family) will give up.  Follow up often with teachers, too.  If you don't hear back from a teacher in a day or two, call or email again.  Chances are he/she is a little overwhelmed, but does want your brother to succeed.

0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	In my opinion and from personal experience there is a bit of both and it also depends on the individuals involved.<br>  <br>  I used to be very private and closed to internet contact until 15 months ago in Yahoo Answers, when a certain very knowledgeable, smiling man on R&P approached me and asked me to be his contact. Since then, I have made some great friends ( you included) and also got my share of disappointments. Some of those friendships are much more important to me then " real" life friends now and the feelings I have are extremely profound and life altering. I  feel very enriched emotionally and intellectually, I guess because we can share more of our real interests so easily.<br>  <br>  My kids have also met some great persons online, for one of my daughters it even meant a great professional opportunity she is taking advantage of right now. The other has an online boyfriend who made her step over some insecurities and the youngest one speaks perfect English now, as her best online friend is in New Jersey, almost 3000 miles away.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if people stop living all together and spend their money and lives on Second Life and similar places....that might be a reason to be concerned and worried, as they loose any connection to real life.|`|AA10952386	I think the Internet has become an important tool in enhancing social interaction because it has brought so many people together who would otherwise not know each other.<br>  If you join a support group on line and meet with them in real life, it is adding to your social productivity. <br>  And, if you make a friend online and communicate with them via internet because it is too expensive to call the person, you are still being somewhat sociable because you are sharing experiences, knowledge and information that would not have been available with those you interact with face to face on a daily basis.|`|874EAxkfaa	weaken ,at the very least!|`|pY0n2qDKaa	it helps me stay in touch with my family and friends back home|`|Qp9Qmsy4aa	I'd say it's a double-edged sword. It may be a fast, easy way to communicate, but it is in no way a replacement for real social interaction. For example, dating online is very different from dating in person. On that same note, breaking up with someone you know personally is much different - and sometimes more hurtful - when done over the net. Kept to a minimum, it may be good. But when it becomes your only real communication method, it becomes a problem.|`|2eWVaB9Waa	A bit of both.<br>  <br>  It can destroy some forms of social interaction such as face to face contact or telephone.<br>  <br>  It can consolidate as it is another way of socialising.<br>  <br>  However, the best form of social interaction is still face to face, though online communication has opened up a whole new world for many of us.

WkYOTRLqaa	Viewing yourself as a "better" person than you actually are.
QAtpLEEFaa	Every aspect of our 'self' is affected by our Looking Glass Self in Cooleys words. (web site 1) So an example which might more easily clarify what a social self is, is this example of how it feels to lack some essential aspects of this social self.<br>  <br>  Helen Keller became blind and deaf when she was two years old.  this affliction did not simply affect her physically but it limited her development of her 'social self'<br>  <br>  "What thought did she have in the five years she wandered in complete isolation? She said years later that she 'was like a ship in a dense fog, groping its way without compass or sounding-line'. And that she lived in 'a conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught or that I lived or acted. I had neither will nor intellect. . . I had no power of thought'. <br>  <br>  She also called herself a 'Phantom in a No-World'." this was because <br>  she had not been able to develop an ability we all take for granted, the ability to apply symbolic concepts to things.  This is her account of what happened to her when she did (much later in life than most of us) llearn this :<br>  <br>  '. Anne, her private teacher  started teaching Helen to finger spell. Spelling out the word “Doll” to signify a present she had brought with her for Helen. The next word she taught Helen was “Cake”. Although Helen could repeat these finger movements she could not quite understand what they meant. And while Anne was struggling trying to help her understand, she was also struggling to try and control Helen’s continuing bad behaviour.<br>  <br>  . After a month of Anne’s teaching, what the people of the time called a “miracle” occurred.<br>  <br>  Helen, at 7 years old,  had until now not yet fully understood the meaning of words. When Anne led her to the water pump on 5 April 1887, all that was about to change.<br>  <br>  As Anne pumped the water over Helen’s hand , Anne spelled out the word water in the girl’s free hand. Something about this explained the meaning of words within Helen, and Anne could immediately see in her face that she finally understood.<br>  <br>  Helen later recounted the incident:<br>  <br>  “We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance of the honey-suckle with which it was covered. Someone was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten, a thrill of returning thought, and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me.”<br>  <br>  Helen immediately asked Anne for the name of the pump to be spelt on her hand and then the name of the trellis. All the way back to the house Helen learned the name of everything she touched and also asked for Anne’s name. Anne spelled the name “Teacher” on Helen’s hand. Within the next few hours Helen learnt the spelling of thirty new words".(web site 2)<br>  <br>  In summary in learning the concept of water Helen at the same time learnt the concept  of symbolism, or the concept of conceptual thought.<br>  <br>  It was this that freed her from her pre-social self and freed her from being as she said: 'A Phantom in a No-World'."|`|chsjMbBmaa	? At least a significant portion of our ‘self’ is<br>  socially directed and influenced.<br>  ? Interpersonal Self or Social Self<br>  part of self that engages face-to-face, in<br>  relation with others<br>  ? Social Roles -> Social Identity or Societal Self<br>  can include ethnicity, gender, age, place of<br>  residence or any other social categorization<br>  that helps characterize a person’s identity.<br>  ? Some argue that ‘self’ is largely a function of<br>  the social environment.

No offense Mike. Many women wonder why they are nice girls and no man pays them any attention. Except with females, people assume it's cause they are dogs etc. I'll give you my take on all this **** for what it is worth. The mating game is all front and deceit. I have been crazy about guys, but knowing the equation, i.e, he will **** me if I let him, I act nonchalant and cold and hard to get. Yet to meet a man didnt appreciate that, cause in a way, it is a compliment to him. If I don't like I guy, I don't play. I let him know straight, NO. So playing hard to get is a sign of interest. I know that you would tire of me very quickly if I didnt and I like sex as much as you, I want to take you home first night just like you do (be honest) but as a female, I have to impress upon you that I am a better DNA prospect than the other equally impressive woman down the bar who would sleep with you and be honest. It;s all a game. You know this. You have played it, it hasnt worked, so now you have lost your 'game' and feel anger cause you are genuine. As a woman, I went there too. Here is my advice. Get your game back! **** trying to project being nice and confident and respectful. Be yourself and if she aint into it, **** her and move on to the next chick. You are blessed with being a male and the ability to take rejection far more than the bitches who imply they are rejecting you. She takes that home all night. We cannot, as a gender (monkey stuff) handle rejection. Men are able to cause ye don't get emotionally involved in sex like we do, so it is not a crushing emotional blow. You need to figure out who you are and what you are selling. If you want a decent girl, long term, let her think you want to **** her, but despite yourself, you are holding back cause she is special. Script it yourself. women like a man to make the choices cause we are weary of being afraid of every man and everytime we try to be free. I cant walk down a street at night, I cant get down and go for a drink in a bar by myself without being labelled, I have to worry about being raped all the time and compete with men all the time just to get the same ****** wage for the same job. Let her know you like her.Let her know you are special and she is special. Behave confidently and accordingly. take her out of the **** dating pool. Let her know she has found her man and make HER wait for sex, then she will know if you are serious (not to long though and always initiate sex first time).Literally club her over the head, drag her to your cave and cry like a baby once she is there, make her feel safe cause you are a man and empower her.

One would think that your question is really an expression of your outrage that you think someone doesn't think that you're up to snuff.<br>  <br>  In reality the main reason why men and women have so many difficulties is because they are always searching.  If you're thinking of searching all the time you're never going to find.  Basically everyone's focus is clouded.  Secondly, down deep there is little acceptance, be it personal acceptance of what we really want or who we really are as individuals.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you and the whole world for that matter is:  stop taking advice.  As long as we demand that the exterior world influence our tastes and decisions we will never be happy.  So turn off the TV, put down the porn and get into your own head.

For instance a lot of men (not all) assume they can just use and dump a woman after they have had sex with them, its as if they completely lose interest. Did that woman ask to be used for sex and then dumped, or arent men aware that most woman actually would like to have a relationship which is why shes putting herself out there socially. <br>  <br>  You cant be involved in the "come hither" game, and then act like a complete retard and start the avoidance games, in which you arent that into her. I guess if guys arent that into women they should not be giving women the idea that they are interested at all, which means you should not continue even talking to women you dislike.<br>  <br>  Using people for sex is not cool unless you both have an agreement, and its the people who do not have this agreement that get hurt. The games need to stop, people need to take the time to get to know one another before bringing sex into the equation.|`|V1MptCMiaa	My brother's standing next to me...ewww...

I'm always curious when ppl say "Don't show your picture!"  ...Why?  Because really, does it make him any closer to finding you?  Makes no sense to me.<br>  <br>  I have a myspace and facebook.

wgZVeLZPaa	Oops. Sorry - I farted.<br>  <br>  Now, usually when you are in the same company of someone, your demeanor does usually match that person you are with. For example, you're going to act different with your grandmother than with your friends. <br>  <br>  She probably is trying to be tactful, depending on the situation, for the person she is with. If this person knows you are an introvert, she is probably respecting that by not pressing her personality onto you. She's letting you be you.<br>  <br>  I think she wants you to be comfortable. Maybe that's why she isn't being so rowdy around you.<br>  <br>  WG - I am a loud person too! :) I also know when to shut up, too. Usually I laugh and joke around to put someone at ease, not make them feel like they don't belong.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	<-This loud, flamboyant almost arrogant woman tries to be respectful of other people.<br>  If I sense that my personality (which is a bit over the top at times) is making someone uncomfortable, I back off..<br>  Perhaps she sensed your sensitivity and chilled out a bit to put you more at ease.|`|AA12242940	I'd say that she is indeed trying to be less intimidating. She may think that her shy counterpart can't "handle" her real personality, and is just being civil.<br>  <br>  Definately does not admire shy girl's "refinement," and does not wish to emulate that.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	She's probably just adapting to her social circumstances (in this case, being around you, who are shy and introverted) which is a perfectly normal thing to do. <br>  <br>  When we get more used to others' individual traits, we let our own guard down. In the meantime, we adjust and use good manners.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Because shes got manners, and is considerate towards someone who perhaps might be intimidated by her loudness.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Things aren't always as they seem. <br>  <br>  In reality, she's probably not changed her basic personality. Instead, she's choosing to adapt to a specific social milleau because she's being pressured... if not outright bullied by those allegedly shy, gentle, timid-seeming women she would like to consider as her peers. <br>  <br>  As for me, been there, done that...I used to belong to a women's church group where the women in the group especially the pastor's wife always made me feel like somehow I didn't measure up because they saw me as a "throw caution to the wind" loud, uninhibited woman. This group of women were big-time into that whole "Fascinating Womanhood" sort of role model...even though they weren't Mormons, strangely enough.<br>  <br>  At the time, it was important for to be liked by that group, to fit in. It was like I wanted to prove I could be a good Marine and still be a truly 'feminine' and refined woman in the way they defined what feminine and "refined" was.<br>  <br>  So I "changed"...but that was only temporary. I felt increasingly uncomfortable, so I eventually went back to my own outgoing and outspoken ways and I decided if those women can't accept me as is, then the hell with them.  Yes, I lost those friends but gained others who weren't so manipulative and uptight!<br>  <br>  Looking back I realize how silly it was to let those small minded people try to make me ashamed of who I am simply for their convenience.<br>  <br>  As the author Rita Mae Brown said, The reward for conformity is that everyone likes you but yourself.<br>  <br>  So I predict that eventually, that person will return to herself but she'll also have a better idea of when and where it's appropriate to tone it down a bit...just as the shy person should know when it's the right time to be assertive and speak up and not use her so-called "shy, retiring ways" to control others!<br>  <br>  One can learn to do that in order survive in certain social milleaus...and still get to be themselves most of the time.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Ok...gloves off!<br>  <br>  If you can't handle an HONEST and straightforward answer, then why did even you bother to post this question in the first place? Were you just trying to build a consensus and now you're mad because some of us won't play this game? Why don't you try growing up and realizing everyone has a right to an opinion, just as they have a right to have their own basic personality without censure or pressure to conform!<br>  <br>  You're not fooling anyone for a New York minute...you have some narcissistic need to set yourself up as "better" than that other person, and quite frankly, it stinks! <br>  <br>  No, I'm not at all paranoid!  I've just have been where she's been...and it sounds to me like she needs an ally from people like you! Sorry, but I don't confuse "shyness" and "refinement" with basic PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE and MEAN behavior!<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are the one with the problem, not she...or me! You are the one who is being very judgmental and unaccepting of who this other person is...and also apparently of who I am. Your attitude is straight out of high school cliquism days...or the Stepford Wives at the very least!!!  <br>  <br>  The very idea that you assume that she "admires" you as being refined is ARROGANCE at its worst!<br>  <br>  I assert that it's better to be a little "loud" and flamboyant and remain true to oneself than it is to knuckle under to some self-righteous peer-pressuring gossippy jellyfish who think she's better than everyone else...and is making such comments because she is quite possibly JEALOUS of that person!  Yes, I said jealous!!! Now deal with it, sister....<br>  <br>  I wonder how you'd feel if the shoe were on the other foot and she had come to yahoo!answers and was badmouthing and analyzing YOU and your personality like this???  If you were as "proper" as you claim you are, you wouldn't be doing this stuff!  Maybe you should ask yourself how "refined" is this specific behavior? Seriously?

6NZamyGPaa	addiction comes with a persons personality. You can tell when people have the 'addiction' type personality. they do hobbies non stop and can never get enough of something that is fun to them. or it can be genetic. and even without both of those, someone can be an addict because of environmental causes. For example, a study of adults who experienced corporal punishment as children, showed that 30% of them had drug/alcohol addiction. People can get addicted to something, simply because everytime they used it, it brought them pleasure and they don't want to leave it, and find no reason to. <br>  <br>  A cure to addiction is all will-power. Yes for smoking there's things like the patch that may help. but ultimately its will power and finding something in life to replace your habits. such as, instead drinking, pick up a new hobby of making crafts. i don't know.|`|CfFntr5Haa	I have no idea, and to stop..ask your parents or a friend (if friend find some way to keep it locked or sealed so they cant get into it take off the battery or somthing) to hide it in their or your house, until you go balistic and you cant take it anymore and you go crazy tearing the walls apart searching... then... you might be able to stop :)|`|ZWaRNMzVaa	To what??  Theres different reasons!  Websites? Books? Song? Cigar? Cigarette?|`|Dx2bkPVuaa	There are different types of addictions, what are you talking about in particular? Substance addiction?<br>  <br>  When a person first experiences a new stimuli (be it drugs or porn etc.) there is a novel experience that occurs within the body and mind. Something that has never been experienced before. If the person likes the feeling they will try to achieve it again, this is never possible. The second time this stimuli is experienced the body recognizes it and it will never be the same again. In an attempt to regain that original feeling the person will increase the amount of stimuli or severity of it (i.e. more drugs, more intense types of porn etc.) With the increased amounts of stimuli, the body gets used to it and begins to be dependent upon it. Hope this answers your question.|`|5IpvNaW0aa	There are many different reasons for addiction, and individuals will often develop an addiction through a confluence of these reasons.<br>  <br>  There is evidence at the genetic/heredity level that seems to indicate predisposition. This means that certain genetic traits are shared among people who have addictions that do not appear in other segments of the population. These traits may allow for certain aspects of a person's physiology to be more prone to developing dependence. This can be seen in certain variations in how different individuals process or produce neurochemicals in their brain. This also has to do with how receptor sites on brain cells operate.<br>  <br>  Environmental factors also play a role. A person's level of self-awareness and feelings of self-worth would necessarily play their part. Situations which may arise early on in a person's life may create a distinct lack of value that one may normally develop for themselves. This can open the door for the need to supplant actual feelings of self-love and satisfaction with what ephemeral and external sources can provide.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the addiction, be it drugs, alcohol, gambling, relationships, etc., a 12-step program is the fundamental tool of many recovery programs. The basic 12 steps that groups’ members actively stress are as follows, varying in some degree per addiction recovery program. Note that no particular religion or spiritual affiliation is required. All are welcome and invited.<br>  <br>  12-Step Program<br>  <br>  We admit we are powerless over our addiction - that our lives have become unmanageable <br>  We believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity <br>  We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God <br>  We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves <br>  We admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs <br>  We are entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character <br>  We humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings <br>  We made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all <br>  We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others <br>  We continue to take personal inventory and when we are wrong promptly admit it <br>  We seek through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understand God, praying only for knowledge of God's will for us and the power to carry that out <br>  Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we try to carry this message to other addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. <br>  Basically members recite the steps at their meetings. And there may be a presentation or group discussion based upon one particular step that day, with the rest of the event focused on individual needs or issues that are brought up by members, so that each member gets to address his or her top or immediate concerns, seek help and help others to get through, “One day at a time.”<br>  <br>  OTHER RECOVERY TOOLS<br>  <br>  Here are more tools to aid with healing from addictions, listed in no particular order.<br>  <br>  Internal Motivators– Many decide to kick their addictions based upon interior motives like love, a sense of achievement, competition, responsibility and a number of other reasons. A love for a child can make some stop the denial process dead in its tracks, allowing recovery to step in. Watching a close friend or relative who is farther along the addictive path of destruction can also be an eye-opener, resulting in some addicts adopting the “I can do it” attitude to kick the habit. Some simply want their own self-respect back and respect from others. While other addicts prefer better health and a sharper mental state, and decide to overcome their addictions and recover. Regardless of the reasons, internal motivators can be welcome stepping-stones in the path of recovery.<br>  <br>  External Motivators - Other motivators along the way are external, like money, work, housing, etc. For example, an addict is generally well aware of the money needed for the continued purchasing of the addictive substances. Someone not used to living in less desirable conditions because income is lacking, may not need much of a jolt of reality other than the first eviction notice, to spur him or her to quit spending hard-earned money on drugs, gambling, porn or cigarettes, etc. And some, who may really value their jobs and are striving to maintain good work standards and ethics, may see reality when they are passed over for a promotion or annual raise because of tardiness, sloppiness, mishandling of money, etc., and may seek help to get their work act together promptly. <br>  <br>  To help with internal and motivators, addicts and their support people can turn to recovery tools like books, videos, movies, healing music, speakers and events focused on addiction and recovery. A good place to begin is at your own local library or favorite bookstore. O|`|3rv5mjfeaa	yOu cAn GEt ADDicTed LOtS oF WaYZZ!!!!
b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	Make your fall a beautiful dive, realize that you are not 100% the changes but also the changeless observing the changes.|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.<br>  Yes, have experienced a few "rugs" being pulled out from under me through my life.  Have re-evaluated and come into higher awareness of self, others and life.<br>  Have learned to take moments as those as "gifts" of lessons in life.  Turn "sour" experiences into awareness, wisdom, lessons, insight.<br>  <br>  Whether it's felt to be "sudden" or more slower. . .I transition through "new self" changes pretty much same as changes of new home, job, relationship, etc.<br>  <br>  There's a "discomfort" that's felt while transitioning through more intense changes in life. . .Yet, they are moved, evolved and grown through.<br>  It's not "fun", and overall, I don't do "change" well. . .but I still do it just the same because I choose to and outcome is brighter, wiser and I'm stronger for having moved through it.<br>  .|`|IAXhu2tuaa	It is not easy to give up the past.

I'm a military brat so everyone thinks I should be able to adapt, but nope, I don't welcome change :/ I moved last year to the U.S. and I'm still acting weird. Last summer, I think I had a mental breakdown (not exactly sure), but even if I didn't, it sure felt like crap. Right now I'm a loner in school :/ no motivation to make friends, horrible self esteem (I'm too obsessed with my huge nose and long face to even start critiquing my body xD), and I just don't care about life anymore. I used to be normal, but now I'm just not.|`|r9PpGzNJaa	I tend to resist change when the rug has been pulled beneath me. When i moved for the first time in my life, it took me about 6 months just to get use to my new home and community, I would miss all my old friends and everything, but a way that i would make myself comfortable in my new area is to meet new people and make friends. that was when i was 16 though.|`|TRrTunqvaa	i used to hate myself in everyway. i compared myself to everyone, wising i was smarter, slimmer, stronger.. but then i came to terms with myself and realized that no matter what, im going to be in this body my whole life.. and instead of critiscizing myself, i learned to celebrate everything, and people noticed and ive attracted more people, which has led me to feel even better about myself!|`|g7FsVQhUaa	What I say and what I do are two different things.<br>  <br>  I'm all talk when it comes to going with the flow.

UwiGwDGdaa	I don't get in "internet fights" because I view it as a big waste of time. In my opinion, "virtual fighting" is really childish - you don't actually see this person face-to-face, so no real resolution can be achieved. You can't see their body language, speech inflection, and there are chances you can misinterpret their point as a result. <br>  <br>  In my experience, the people who fight online are the ones who won't do it face-to-face because they're afraid of confrontation. <br>  <br>  Besides, I don't care what people think of me over the internet - they're not part of my "real life" so I have no reason to argue.
sa8dElLZaa	When your business deals in a foreign currency you are exposed to certain risks.<br>  <br>  For example, you might find that after agreeing a price for exported or imported goods the exchange rate changes before delivery. Clearly, this can work both for and against you.<br>  <br>  Some countries' currencies and exchange rates are more volatile than others because of their inflationary or unstable economies. Your bank should be able to advise you about this.<br>  <br>  Of course, because exchange rates can go both up and down, it can be tempting to gamble that this will work out in your favour. However, this is extremely risky and could land you with a significant financial loss.<br>  <br>  It's safer to reduce the risk by using one of the forms of hedging available through a bank. Hedging simply means insuring against the price of an item - in this case, currency - moving against you in the future. There are many different types of currency hedging and your bank should be able to help you with the best solutions for your business. Two types of hedging are discussed in this guide - see the pages in this guide on forward foreign exchange contracts, and buying currency options. You may also consider opening a foreign currency account - see the pages in this guide on opening foreign currency accounts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?r.l1=1073858790&r.l3=1074298334&r.lc=en&type=RESOURCES&itemId=1074298641&r.l2=1073858942&r.s=sc" rel="nofollow">http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/act...</a>
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	Some people may want to commit suicide simply because they bluntly feel that they cannot get what they want. Instead of fiercefully fighting and dissolving or murdering their foe, instead of trying and contriving some glowingly strategic ways to solve their problems, they may surdly resort to trying and killing themselves, punishing themselves, condemning themselves to their death, for what they cannot achieve.<br>  <br>  If the self-killing of oneself may be seen as an act of perverted irrationality or of madness, the motive behind a self-killing of oneself may sometimes be a crisis, a deep and long-lasting and very painful pressure. Whenever people are in great distress, they may blindly resort to irrationalities.<br>  <br>  When somebody wants something, and gets feeling it as an impossible wish, and deepest desperation can be looming forth, then the idea or the impulse of suicide can appear and become peremptory, clearly depicting itself as the only and final liberating way out.<br>  <br>  When somebody has done something that is felt as deeply regrettable, where all honour has been smashed, and or where the grip of shame is unbearable, the only available honourable way out may be suicide.<br>  <br>  When there is a supposed or imposed higher cause or creed that may demand the deadly sacrifice of one's own life for a supposed sublime ideal, then suicide in the style of kamikaze, or of hara-kiri, or of self-martyrizing suicide-bomber, may be seen as the only glowing praiseworthy heroic way out.<br>  <br>  Of course and in moments of clarity there will ever be resistance within oneself about the killing of oneself, a resistance due to the fact that suicide is a way of possible bloody no return.<br>  <br>  Also, our own body has sort of got a fiercer life of its own, and our own body will never allow us to pierce or stab or poison or smash it to shreds  without a severe retortion of unbearable pain, of high cry, of long loud screaming agony.<br>  <br>  Allow me to conclude all this with a laugh.|`|O1g03Rg3aa	Because they feel that something unjust has happened in their life far too often. They feel like the world is moving along at it's fast pace, and they're left behind in the dust, like no one cares about them. They have had a lot of emotional trauma, have been ignored or hurt, or have lost someone very close to them. They are the most common reasons I can think of right now, but there could be millions of reasons why someone would take their life. It's really a personal thing, with everyone's story being different. <br>  <br>  I've thought about it before, because there is a very high authority figure that wants me dead. Too bad, it didn't happen.|`|yI8NhRllaa	well somethink tragic could of happened like a family death or a failed exam or it could just be serious untrearted depression but apparantly 1/2 of the worlds population consider suicide at some stage of there lives.|`|ed910418c525aafef203ce51a2249facaa	simply give up on life<br>  and don't know why they are here in this world<br>  sometimes they get so stressed out they find no way out but just to end their life|`|Gc82L3S4aa	Depretion|`|bhvW1nMbaa	depression.<br>  they wanna give up.|`|t56hZozqaa	they hate their life and often depression, too|`|N6frEVbiaa	tehy feel like there are no answers so they give up|`|lrJopeC5aa	It has to do with seeing nothing worth living in life and feeling like life only makes you suffer instead of giving you any type of enjoyment or hope.

That is the main reason, that people kill themselves.  They don't usually want to die, but they are in so much emotional pain and see no way of ending it that death is their way out. Most people don't want to end their life per se but want to end the pain and the hopelessness that they are feeling.  When nothing else seems to work they resort to suicide.

Her lack of communication may have nothing what so ever to do with your need for a reply.  She may have other concerns occupying her mind and not feel ready to talk right now.  Don't persist in messaging her inbox.  Wait until she is ready to enjoy your friendship.  As you said, you don't want to push her away.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Venting is okay, but it seems like you're making a big deal out of nothing. <br>  <br>  So she didn't respond to your virtual communication...maybe she was occupied or just didn't feel like talking. Don't be quick to jump to conclusions over two small attempts to communicate online or through a text message. <br>  If you're really that concerned, CALL HER or see her IN PERSON. You can't communicate effectively through the cyber-world.
JGZAnvUFaa	Every salon is different.  At my current one a haircut includes a blow dry.  When I get my highlights, it includes the haircut and blow dry.  I did go to a salon where they charged separately for the hi-lights and cut.  A more local salon isn't as likely to charge separately.  Thats just my observation|`|u1vEj8DYaa	Salons charge extra for "product" (hairspray, mousse, gel, whatever) and blowdry.  Its standard.  I don't get the extra done because I come straight home to shower.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Every place I've been charges extra for the blow-dry, so I just skip it and straighten it myself.|`|1wIek546aa	i've never been charged for a blow dry, but then if im gonna shell out $100 bucks i'd better get some pretty good service.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	The place I go charges extra for a blow dry and even more for a style.<br>  <br>  I just blow dry it and style it myself when I get home, they always make my hair too big anyways.|`|HNAdM1hSaa	I would not know as I had never selected to pay anyone to blow......dry my hair.  My hair is very long and thick so I usually just trim it at home.  =P|`|nhZb43pIaa	They charge extra for the blow dry. I skip it and leave with wet hair, lol. I have to shower as soon as I get home anyway to get all the hair bits off my body.
mVTGl6HGaa	Did you know that "Centuries ago, the Catholic Church declared left-handed people to be servants of the Devil. For generations, left-handers who attended Catholic schools were forced to become right-handed." They justified this belief on the basis of several bible quotations that stigmatized left-handedness.<br>  <br>  There are also quite a few superstitions about being left-handed. It wasn't until we realized, in the last century or so, that there are legitimate biological reasons for left-handedness, that people were no longer forced to use their right hand. And, I'm not the only person who sees the parallels between being left-handed and being gay. You can read a lot more about left-handedness at this site.
FL67UPPHaa	Far too much!<br>  <br>  I'm usually here for at least a couple of hours every day.

You know things can be a boring drag and I need to see if there is any action going on any where else. I'm one of those people who basically live on their computer. I don't like being away from it more than a couple hours at a time, when the cable goes out due to weather I'm like a heroin addict looking for a fix.

CfFntr5Haa	hmm, someone just needs a big huggy, and someone who gets you :) hang out with the nicest friend you have and tell him/her this, they can usually make you feel a little better when you tell someone you trust :D and if they care, awesome friend! maybe Lisa, has a few problems, she tends to get pretty into your business, and also a little snobish (a tiny, I dont want to get in any fights) you should go to your school adviser :) its nice to tell them too, they might tell your teacher how you felt when she asked you those questions, and that you just got startled :l and gym :l I used to be horrible, (still am most of the time) and I just started running or playing with the dogs more often, exercise your heart rate :) in my school you dont need gym after the 9th grade o-o so you are probably very close to 9th :) Im having an okay day o...o you seem a pretty stressed person! you should take up some yoga, or meditate :) in with the postive, out with the negitive :) (sorry my aunt is pretty supernatural, and I learn alot of stuff about energy and stuff, shes this weird kind of doctor, alot of people come to her :))|`|XzLUA7ataa	Sorry about your bad day.  I've observed some really positive things about you even though we're only communicating through Answers.<br>  You are able to clearly define your feelings and able to vent your frustrations in a healthy way.  Just writing this note will help you somewhat since we all need to vent at times.  Try telling Lisa that someones comments pushed your emotional buttons, and that's about all you can share with her right now.  You appreciate her concern but please respect your space now,  you'll get back to her another time.  The history teacher won't get in trouble even if the observer thought you weren't focused on the class.  And, you are absolutely right about how kids can sense when you're having a weak moment and verbally attack, tease, torment, etc.  They're doing it to show their superiority and strength, but actually it's caused by their own insecurity and need to prove themselves.  You've got great character and you'll make it.  Take gym class one session at a time.|`|1b4u5Ch7aa	you no what you need a friend to talk to friends help alot|`|2wFjqYfpaa	Sounds bad. From reading your narrative I get the feeling you are a bit hard on yourself. Everyone interprets and sees things the way they want to see them. Pain and suffering are things that are really quite relative. We all choose how we respond to whatever situations we are in, if we have a bad day, bad week, boyfriend/girlfriend breaks up with us, excess homework, peers being mean, whatever the source is; we choose to react (sometimes over-react) however we want to whether it be through crying, hitting something/someone, etc. <br>  <br>  You are in complete control with how much weight you associate to all of the ordeals of your day. I feel like you attribute a lot of weight to everything bad that happens (Lisa being clingy, testing, peers in gym class, history class, partnering up in spanish). So needless to say once all these things build up on top of each other, you implode. <br>  <br>  I think you have a good feel for Lisa's concern about you, but I also think you had so much going on already that no matter what she said you were going to interpret it in a negative way. How could Lisa possibly know how you were feeling in spanish, history, gym class, or about the testing without you telling her? Something seemed to have gone awry in you to Lisa, so she asked. Granted it wasn't the best way to do it, but it sounds like she wanted to know so she could help support you in whatever way she could. <br>  <br>  ADVICE: Nothing about your day was your fault. You did not ask for the testing, you cannot control Lisa or your peers, you did not ask for the testing, you cannot control Lisa or your peers, you did not ask for group work in spanish, or for your history teacher to be evaluated. You went about and did things in the only way you knew how. The only responsibility that lies on you is how you reacted to the chain of events that culminated in this "terrible day." <br>  <br>  If I were in your shoes I would take one thing at a time and evaluate how awful each of them 'really' is. Does the testing produce the same, more, or less stress than partnering up in spanish? Is the history class situation the exact same as my peers "tormenting" me? Dissect each, and I ultimately would come to the realization that these things are outside of my control and the only thing I can do about them is to determine how much I allow each to affect me. <br>  <br>  You can tell Lisa about your day, and that you just need to be alone to process it all. Assure her you two are still friends, thick as thieves, and you appreciate her concern, but you are sifting through some **** right now and its a road you have to walk alone. Also tell her you would back off too if she was going through something and she needed space. <br>  <br>  Your teacher won't get in trouble for something a student does. An evaluator evaluates the teacher, the content, and how his students are learning. He is not evaluated based on how his students' days are going. If you know the material it will be reflected on your assignments and tests not how some evaluator saw the class on one day. <br>  <br>  Evaluate for yourself how bad gym is. If someone wants to see something badly enough, they will. If you attribute gym as the worst thing that could ever happen to you, over time you will believe it. You are in control of how terrible you want gym to be. I would wager that you think only bad things happen in gym class. You may not like athletics at all, which may be the root of this. However you cannot get rid of gym class. It's easy to find the bad in any situation, but there are equally as many good things as there are bad in any realm of life. Positive things do exist there, all you have to do is notice them. <br>  <br>  To be redundant, you are in control of how you respond to ANY situation. People made it through concentration camps by altering their perception of things as they happened, as gruesome as they were. You can do the same.|`|O1g03Rg3aa	I'm sorry. That must have sucked. I don't know, maybe try to insult them back? And you can just tell her that you need some room to breathe. If you're not super-interested in a lasting friendship, you can just ignore her for a while. Might do her some good. Explain to your teacher that you were paying attention, but you just got really nervous. I hate gym too, you just have to either blend in with the walls, or try to be the best at something.I dunno, raquetball and tennis are pretty easy. Practice now, kick their butts when the time comes.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Basically it sounds like you're afraid of public events. <br>  <br>  However, things seem to pile up whenever you're upset. When one bad thing happens, you're already upset, so what would normally NOT bother you DID today. <br>  <br>  My suggest for you is to not let these emotions build up inside. Talk to your friends. Write in a journal. Pay a visit to the school counselor and just vent. <br>  <br>  When you spend so much time dwelling on negative events, it will only hurt you. I promise, you will learn how to let things go eventually, you just need to learn how to cope with them. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the observer in your class today. The person was there most likely for the *teacher*, not to observe the kids. You didn't get in trouble - the observer is there to help the teacher improve their teaching skills. The observer might've wanted to see what you were doing - often times kids doodle when they're bored, but, the observer isn't going to get the teacher in trouble. They'll just help that teacher find ways to get the kids more engaged. <br>  <br>  As for gym class - gym class is notorious for always being bad. Remember this - people ridicule others out of their OWN insecurities. So these people are insulting you so they can feel better about themselves and feel "accepted" by a certain group of people (the bullies). Basically, they're so immature that they tease others because they feel insecure themselves. <br>  Have you talked to the gym teacher or school counselor about the situation? They can help you find a resolution for the problem in class - it might mean changing your schedule, or, disciplining the bullies. <br>  <br>  Take life a day at a time. Don't dwell on mistakes or situations - just get your emotions out of your system by talking to someone or writing in a journal, and move on. Bad things happen - how you deal with them is what makes the difference. <br>  <br>  I linked a website to an online journaling community - you can get comments from others or make it completely private. I used to love it as a teen because I found other people who had the same problems as I did.|`|yI8NhRllaa	ok dont say any think to lisa and just let it go if she ses any thin 2 u just say "ow just a bad day thats all" and smile ok<br>  Your history teacher will be fine we threw pens at our teacher and he passed no prob and if your still not happy get a massive slab of chocolate and ic cream and just pig out.<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun

What it is is really just some gimmick by the Democrats so make it seem like they doing something and to get them reelected in the 2010 elections.<br>  <br>  In truth, most economists will tell you that  the economy is in a trough right now but will eventually come back to where it was a few years ago. They will also tell you that the stimulus package will have a minimal impact.|`|Kn90YAzYaa	How bad is the economy really if we can just print up 3.5 trillion, anyway?  I know, they're going to print it, which is going to devalue the dollar even more and cause inflation.  I think the whole country needs to take a big relaxing breath as a whole and start to calm down.  That's half the problem, everyone is panicking.<br>  <br>  Stimulus or not, I think the economy is going to have to balance itself out on its own.  Printing more money is not the answer, if anything, it's making the problem worse.|`|AA12168155	nope. their are a lot of things wrong with the economy. greed and sloth come to mind. the american goal is to get paid more and do less! well that shifts the burden to people who do more and get paid less.
fxmZzkzlaa	I know the feeling, its so real.  The best way I think is to just think about sex before you go to bed and repeat the word sex in your mind and out loud a few times until it sticks like when you get a song stuck on your mind.  It also helps to sleep with an object like a pillow next to your body.<br>  <br>  Sweet dreams lol!|`|LDe9yzCKaa	watch porn and play w/ urself before you go to sleep .. hope it helps|`|b7U7uoTpaa	WRONG!  All the answers you are getting are wrong.  Unfortunately, we can not control our dreams.  Anyone that tells you they can is lying.  Our subconscious has a mind of its own, so to speak.  I haven't worked in the bar business for 15 years, yet I occasionally still have the working at the bar and not knowing what to do dreams.  Masturbating before you go to sleep is both fun and helps you relax, but it will not guarantee a sex dream.|`|jQz5vABzaa	Alright I'll tell you how!<br>  <br>  Think about the amazing dream u had and how you would like to continue your dream before going to sleep yet while you're in bed!<br>  <br>  Also this awesome book taught me so much that I read parts every now and then for enjoyment and sexual fantasy to arouse my interest..<br>  U can find it off ebay I guess, I got the main link for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://eliydallas.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://eliydallas.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy girl,<br>  Cookie|`|YLkD4lgPaa	think about your dream again and watch some porn and try to imagine that u r in there.

The war is basically financed on credit.  Homeowners were given loans they could never, ever pay off in 30 years as their living expenses, including their house, exceeded their income - so they lived on credit cards, getting deeper and deeper into debt.<br>  <br>  It boils down to financial irresponsibility on the every day folks part; and total greed by the financial institutions that are supposed to be wisely investing our retirement funds and not blowing them on their own greedy lifestyle.  <br>  <br>  The private investments firms got greedy and gambled away monies their clients would not need for 30+ years until they retire. They gambled it away on risky investments.  Ever been to a financial broker who signs you and shows you how much money you would have if you invested $10,000.00 by the time you retire?  That investment scheme assumes a 10% or higher annual return.  If you do the research, 10% or higher return per year assumes the most aggressive growth and highest risk of all the investment vehicles.  They don't tell you more conservative investments will earn you 5-7% annual with much lower risk.  So they are greedy and they get you seeing dollar signs and evoke your greed and you invest your money into very speculative and risky investments.  It is all about greed.<br>  <br>  The private investment firms took their lesson from the government that spends away our social security and medicare contributions to pay for entitlement programs for their political hacks that get them elected becuase they will not need to pay out for 30+ years.  Well the boomers are all retiring now, if they can afford to, and drawing out their funds.  The govenment gets caught with its pants down because it has wasted all the money to pay off political hacks that got them elected to office by starting useless government programs, headed up by fully salaried political hacks heading up the useless "projects" and "programs" and "departments."  Both political parties have done this and both are equally guilty for this mess.<br>  <br>  I pray that God will just bring it all to judgment, purge the floor, and start over in our country.  Greed, desire for political power and prestige, and just plain old sin is at the bottom of this mess.  But no one wants to admit it, nor fix it.  What a shame our country is about to be irreperably ruined. May God have mercy on the everyday hardworking, good natured Americans in our country by sending such a powerful spiritiual revival in this country that all the corrupt wicked politicians in all parties are ousted and permanently shamed in the public arena; and our nation turns back to God Almighty.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Gas prices put the hurt on almost everybody and caused the price of everything else to go up,except real estate.I had to sell my home and move because I could no longer afford to drive 50 miles to work.Luckily I got it sold before the values started dropping really bad.That along with it being an election year (which always puts speculation in the economy) and the banks not willing to work with creditors.|`|CTN8bnVgaa	Going off the gold standard.<br>  <br>  What a long, strange trip it's been.|`|4b6944c4b303ab9627900f771b29a1afaa	What do all those things have in common?

We gave up the idea of saving money and instead borrowed ourselves into deep debt. We choose to live a lifestyle beyond our means with no thought that things arnt always going to be as good as they were. We have forgotten that the economy has ups AND downs. We have poorly educated ourselves and have invested foolishly. We have run to government to solve every problem that faces us and were surprised when there was a cost that came with it. Worst of all, we has asked the government to sell out the prosperity of our children with massive borrowing to “save us” from a market correction we deeply deserve.|`|ENiXozJnaa	Opportunistic politians.<br>  <br>  Clinton Administration.<br>  A) They signed into law the dissolving of the barrier between commercial banks and investment banks.<br>  B) They pushed banks to "expand" lending to non-traditional loan borrowers, thus sub-prime loans were born.

ENiXozJnaa	It started when dim-witted and opportunistic politicians tinkered with the free market in the name of political correctness.  Policitians mandated that banks abandon their time-tested, mathematically proven, and free market driven loan underwriting guidelines in order to write loans to those who historically would not be bankable.  <br>  <br>  A bank on it's own accord does not want defaults, and there is a reason bankers have the reputation of being conservative, tight fisted, and stodgy.  It's in their best interest to be so.  When Clinton dissolved the barrier between commercial banks and investment banks, and then signed the changes to the Community Reinvestment Act in the late 90's, and pressured Fannie Mae to create and back a "wider" range of loans...the stage was set for the financial disaster we are experiencing today.<br>  <br>  This, followed up by record low interest rates which stimulated demand, Bush trying to take credit for record homeownership rates and not slow it down, Wall Street bastardizing the process thru the CDO's, homeowners for buying too much house they could not afford or accepting exotic loan terms, the Rating Agencies for giving all the CMO's 'AAA' ratings, and the insurance companies like AIG for insuring all of these now toxic assets which are weighing heavily on banks' balance sheets and causing some to collapse.<br>  <br>  Their is plenty of blame to go around for everyone.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Mega greed and corruption.

My guess:   a torn ligament/tendon.    The catch is it popping out of joint.|`|xsyAljhaaa	I'm not a medical professional, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Knees are very delicate, and are held together by several ligaments. Maybe the weight being put on and off your knees could have put unusual stresses on the joint causing irritation and swelling. You probably should have been using knee pads like the professional flooring/carpet people use. If you're not that physically active it could be a combination of factors. Maybe you crushed some of the cartilage, the clicking, have some internal swelling, or overstressed the supporting musculature from lack of activity in something like putting in a floor. For joint pains, you can use a heating pad, but only for less than 30 minutes, after that it's not good and can make the soreness worse. Take it easy and don't try to force your knee to bend or go to full extension, or you could make something that may heal on its own into a chronic condition. If it bothers you for awhile and doesn't get better, go see a physician.

o52lWpycaa	Well man this is tough to answer. Many Economist predicted that it would get better at the end of 2010. However due to all the troubles going on it is said the Economy will get better in the middle of 2011. At least we are only in a Recession and not a Depression. A Depression takes about 5-10 years to get better while a Recession takes 2-3 years to get better. When the market crashed in 87 the Recession ended in 91. The bad thing is that the crash that happened in 2008 is worse than 87. So it can take longer and more dramatic things can happen. So I would expect things to get better in 2011.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	when economists come back to do their jobs.

Hjsy8rnRaa	I think it's either you dreamed of it, but you have completely forgotten it since we often forget our dreams, or you have already experienced it before (like some people believe in)|`|jPM3OHj2aa	a few years back when i was deeply involved in left hand path religions, i would often have, you could call it a mini-faint. It was as if my head would just fall back or forward, whichever was most comfortable for the position it was already leaning to, and i would have a very fast dream about something random. and it ALWAYS happened within a day or two. unfrotunately it never helped me in anything because i tend to not follow my instincts and i only remembered the dreams after things happened. :(|`|VC4Y3gtPaa	Your living in the past, move toward the future.|`|kM41OvF4aa	i do that a lot too, my cousin says that when you see it you remember it the second that you see it, and it feels like you've seen it before somewhere but really it's just a memory from a second ago that your brain just recalls really quick

NYU37jfGaa	Well, in the town I live in the grammar schools are single sex and I don't see how they can have more grammar school places for girls unless they start sending girls to the boys grammar.  Which I hope is not going to happen as my 11-year-old is going there next year and he is looking forward to being at a boys only school "Girls can be very irritating" he said to me the other day.  If they start sending girls there it is really going to piss him off.|`|WkLJI40baa	I disagree with any form of discrimination based on affirmative action. Lowering the bar for equality sake solves nothing.|`|AKvLiwB6aa	thats not fair...  if the girls r doing better... they shud be the 1s geting into the better schools...|`|fDGPbwdsaa	If it's good in feminists eyes that we have AA for them, I can't for the life of me understand why they would possibly question it for boys... unless of course, they're not really into 'equality' at all levels..?<br>  <br>  This has been seen repeatedly. Feminists demanded changes to the academic system when girls were falling behind, yet when boys started falling behind, they claimed "well girls are better, more mature, boys are not interested, why should girls suffer for boys' choices, etc. etc."<br>  <br>  The school system is currently girl-friendly and not boy-friendly. For example, in the old days (when boys did better) exams were a large part of the end-result scores. Feminists demanded more focus be put on course work. They got their demands met. Now boys are behind, they don't want changes and argue to keep it 'as is'. Incredible.<br>  <br>  Seems like blatant - but predictable - double standards from feminism, again.|`|XIbct4fuaa	Just another example of lowering the bar.  Instead of focusing on helping the boys bring their scores up lets just lower the bar for them so they can be equal.  Makes no sense whatsoever, but our lazy society is always going to take the easy way out.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	The boys should simply be given extra coaching to bring them up to the required level.<br>  <br>  Discrimination, be it in favour of boys OR girls, is just not on.|`|BkleL3F4aa	I don't think people that disagree with affirmative action are going to just change their mind about it just because it "benefits" boys all of a sudden.<br>  <br>  have you tded me? : )|`|CspMhUPoaa	Why not tutor the boys so more of them pass the exam instead of lowering the bar?|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	If they wish to create a two-tier system at all (and not all schools use the 11-plus) they should use it at an age where there is no gender disparity.|`|2eWVaB9Waa	I do not agree with any laws that are in favor of one gender over the other.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Disagree :-) Equal opportunity not equal outcome :-)<br>  <br>  Marx - the majority of the final grade for most GCSEs, A Levels and degrees is still decided by exams (at which boys supposedly do better).|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I didn't support affirmative action then and I don't support it now.

b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Perhaps there are certain "masculine" qualities you find attractive in a woman, such as being assertive, or women who work out and are in good shape, or whatever traits you personally think of as being "masculine". There are masculine and feminine aspects to everybody's personality, regardless of their biological sex or sexual orientation, and your dream may have just represented these personality qualities by using physical attributes. Bottom line: dreams are weird, don't worry about it! You probably had 10 dreams about sex with a woman, but just didn't remember them when you woke up.|`|AA10236380	Relax.  It's totally normal to have the occasional homoerotic dream - doesn't mean you're gay or even bi-curious.  Pretty much the only course of action is to laugh about it in the morning, and skip telling your friends about it, because they will tease you about it pretty much forever.<br>  <br>  First, you're 17 - so you're gonna be thinking about sex pretty much all the time.  That part's bound to show up in dreams frequently.<br>  <br>  Next, you're 17 - so like every other guy your age, on some level you've got to be a little concerned that either (a) you're not  100%, all-man, lumberjacks-and-firefighters straight and (b) God forbid, someone out there might incorrectly thing that you're not Mr. Completely Straight....definitely not the vibe you want to be putting out to the ladies, right?  So that anxiety is also bound to show up in dreams, at least occasionally.|`|cZuzIUJraa	It's perfectly normal to have those kind of dreams.Just because you dream those kind doesn't mean that you are.So don't worry about them and just go on living your life.And then you'll be much happier, and in the long run there really isn't anything to worry about.|`|KJ8Snqlhaa	Are you afraid of being gay or bi after these dreams?

You may be experiencing a reawakening or have a fresh outlook on life.<br>  -To see children in your dream, signify an aspect of yourself and your childlike qualities. You may be retreating back to a childlike state where you are longing for the past and the chance to satisfy repressed desires and unfulfilled hopes. Perhaps there is something that you need to see grow and nurtured.?Take some time off and cater to the inner child within. Alternatively, the dream may be highlighting you innocence, purity, simplicity, and carefree attitude. <br>  -To see a photograph in your dream, indicates that there is a relationship that needs your attention.?You are not looking deep enough in the relationship or situation.

sa8dElLZaa	Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness. It tells how much one thing changes when you change something else that affects it.  Elasticity is a noun. <br>  <br>  The adjective form, "elastic," means something is highly responsive to changes in something else.  For example, elastic demand means that the quantity demanded changes a lot when the price changes. Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded does not change much when the price changes.<br>  <br>  More here -<br>  <a href="http://hspm.sph.sc.edu/COURSES/ECON/Elast/Elast.html" rel="nofollow">http://hspm.sph.sc.edu/COURSES/ECON/Elas...</a>
