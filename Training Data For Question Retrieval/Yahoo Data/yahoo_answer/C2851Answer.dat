En0r0UQ3aa	Here a couple of dance clubs that's happening on Wednesday night.  The music Top 40, Hip Hop, & Soul.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	I am not positive about a Wednesday night but there are a lot of places you can go to on Whittier Blvd. A lot of bars are grouped in LA on certain streets and if you go to one location you are bound to find bars that have something going on for a Wednesday night! There is Lorenas, Hi D HI Tavern, Calif Tiki Club and more on Whittier.|`|AA11617874	There are not that many that I know of on a Wednesday night. Check out the LA Weekly or check the website. Most clubs start on Thursday night.
iZDsMCghaa	Ive had the salad, mmm mmm delish! I like the summer spinache salad better,though and its gone now?! Not sure why. It was the one with spinache,shrimp,egg and avacado. It was soooo good :-)|`|jsxphZJEaa	They are both delicious to eat, especially the spinach and grilled chicken salad, the dressing is flovrful as are the shrimp. As for the sandwich is delicious also, expecially with fries......|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	The salad is very tasty.  Those are both great choices.

fc56bbca111b6dbda688dc4ca553eb32aa	They put the price up there as the sandwich with the fries n drink....they itemize it on the receipt though....that's always been my experience so if  you add it up it should add up to the amount of the combo meal|`|iHJ6W3Izaa	You should always check your receipt<br>  and what you got before you start eating,<br>  or leave the place. <br>  <br>  You were ripped off.<br>  Make sure to check the receipt before<br>  you leave another restaurant, fast-food,<br>  or store.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people make mistakes.<br>  Other times, you are intentionally<br>  ripped off.|`|jfNDo6Beaa	no you didnt get ripped off heres why<br>  <br>  mcdonalds registers are like this you order a meal say a large big mac meal you ress the "L" on the touch screen the press "big mac" then you have to ask what drink they want if they want a coffe or a soft drink you enter "L" "coke" <br>  <br>  it works like that because not every one wants coke as their drink.|`|HFbY9PYzaa	Well you should have figured it out when the person told you how much you owed. They obviously screwed up.|`|fmdfUaH0aa	i think you were ripped off but its just $1.64, its fine.|`|BMSX8tOwaa	No, I don't think you were ripped off, but go back to Mcdonald's and double check. If the price of the meal was 5.89, then your fine. The drink is included in the meal but on the receipt it is rang up separately, In case you wanted a milk or coffee or something. So they deduct the price of the drink from the meal.|`|a0dc5fd630ab1ed180502b056f66af86aa	McDonald's registers ring up the drinks seperately or at least they do where I live. You have the price of the combo meal posted on the board and then if you look at what the price is it takes off the price of the drink. So your posted combo meal should have been the total of both.|`|4hlbpYFfaa	They ring up drinks separate because sometimes the drinks cost more if you super-size it, however the price of the burger does not change. They don't show the additional cost in fries when you super-size them it is just combined with the price of the drinks. |`|a7dIoTsIaa	I think you where ripped off it should have a drink "tha's why is a combo" unless they charged you extra for the extra meat.|`|DqdA3njaaa	what a ripp-off! i never go there anyway, i don't like their food. i bet they're just trying to get more money nd you were observant enough to notice. |`|kJMtU3eOaa	Anyone who goes to McDonald's and pays for anything is ripped off.|`|AA10275738	Did you take the receipt back and ask them? Seems that would be the smart thing to do.|`|9YlgQeLxaa	rip off|`|ZHTfzpT6aa	Depends on where you live.  Where I am, they ring up the drink separately.  As long as the total matches, you're fine.  $5.89 for a combo sounds about right, which is what you paid.  I hope it at least tasted good :)|`|88OpxJ1Daa	You was ripped off,  the drinks was suppose to come with the double quarter pounder. |`|WNoXPtudaa	dats bull ****|`|Xcj3y60Uaa	yep u where |`|MZWdvdEwaa	Yeah, you were.<br>  <br>  When you order a combo(and you did.), your supposed to get a drink.

DUg1IkTIaa	Sure, but the 1st one should be FREE and each additional will be at your expense. |`|NG6eeCfuaa	They are allowed to charge. It's akin to Little Cesar's. LC's charges for their sauce separately when you order their breadsticks. As far as some charging, and others not, in your claim, KFC's are all independently owned franchises. Some rules are set in stone, others are just "recommended" to the franchise owners. So KFC CORP may "recommend" you charge for sauce, however, the independent owner may opt to not charge. I think that is why your seeing the difference. Or it may be a new change "ordered" from KFC to their independent franchise owners, a la the new baggage charges on airlines due to our weak economy. |`|8H0bLwVgaa	The McDonald's here just recently started charging for their sauces. I agree it is a joke to charge 25 cents for a little tiny container of sauce. The funny thing is you can get as much ketchup as you want, but you have to pay for things like BBQ sauce and ranch.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	it is their product that cost them money so yes they are...I don't think they should either though...Get this, McDonalds charges for packets of chicken sauce if you use it for your fries, but if you use it for your chicken nuggets they give it to you free.|`|fc56bbca111b6dbda688dc4ca553eb32aa	It's their product and it's not free for them so yeah they can technically charge for anything they want to....maybe too many people were abusing the free sauce privilege so that's why they started charging  |`|ouvnk5g7aa	i believe they are franchises and they can do whatever they want...|`|kJMtU3eOaa	I agree it's annoying, Now let me tell you this. I lived in Singapore before, There I saw the damnedest stuff. All the fast food places generally control stuff like napkins and straws and salt and pepper and ketchup and chili sauce packets because people there will just take them en masse. You get one napkin at McDonald's per customer. It's not because people there are poor - in fact, they are very well off - but most of them just desire to horde free stuff - no matter what it is.<br>  But this is the gross part: Burger king had old people who worked there to clean the tables and stuff, and they recylce straws from peoples trays (like how do you know if someone really used it or not?) and take unused ketchup and chili packs out of the trach and wipe thim with the same rag they use to clean tables and chairs, then return them to the counter.|`|bXjX8mWgaa	i dont know..but if that area is poorer then they might...coz iv seen it happen... like in this macddonalds in this poorer part of nj... they only give u 2 napkins and they dont have any more that you can help yourself to... and they charge u liek 5cents for additional napkins... kinda wierd.. ino|`|MOG0Q8kiaa	i think its bad Business to charge people, but i guess if you give it away all the time it could cost you in the long run. but i think they make alot of money so why not give one and charge for second.|`|AA10275738	I know the feeling, but every thing is up these days, It's like they use to charge  for extra for cream in your coffee, I drank it black but didn't get it cheaper. |`|vuL7qN1raa	they dont do it here in ocala.<br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  from what i understand, in europe, you ALWAYS pay for condiments.|`|xHVM5DTHaa	wow u mean like the pakets like the ketchup in carls jr. and the tacoa bell sauce in tavoa bell then no they cant but if they put it in a cup thingy than yeah theydo but n carls jr they dont srry out of toopic|`|4X45kCj4aa	they don't here....|`|WNoXPtudaa	yea|`|zcgbIW2yaa	ya that is messed up but then again it's their restaurant and their sauce packs so if they want to charge 25cents each I guess they can.|`|9rD7nlcGaa	yeah, a lot of places do that, it's pretty stupid
AA10275738	I buy mine on line.|`|AA10698792	There is a Michael's Crafts very close to Manhattan in Woodside, Queens, about a mile from the Queensboro Bridge where you can get it.  Just take the R train to the Northern Boulevard stop, walk past the Sports Depot and right after it is a shopping center where Michael's is.|`|e9ce9fe59a10387b76a9d932713c8c20aa	you should be able to buy candle was in any craft store|`|V2XDNEAXaa	You can buy it from<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=candle%20wax&tag=p045-20&index=garden&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&...</a><br>  Hope this helps<br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|AA11585199	Not sure, but if you check out the yellow pages and contact some arts and crafts stores, I'm sure it wouldn't take long before you found something.

WKzlZCn0aa	I Hate McDonalds...<br>  Maybe Its Because I Work There.<br>  ...<br>  Everytime I Get Off Work, And Go See My Boyfriend.<br>  I Have To Spray Like Half A Bottle Of Perfume Just to Get The Stentch Away. I HATE It,.|`|oncX3xVtaa	YES! I used to love Mcdonalds. Most of the time their food was good......well for fast food. Until about three weeks ago when I was sold a raw Big mac! It was seriously raw. And I took it to the counter, Told the lady it was raw, and she just looked at me and said "ok". I reported it to their head quarters. Nothing was done, I will never buy another thing from there.|`|g8uB7fKTaa	ive got a salad there once and it was really nasty. <br>  i always feel soo unhealthy after eating it, I gain weight A LOT from it, and most of the crap doesnt even taste that good. <br>  I do like the chicken sandwich though...havent had that in months |`|kJMtU3eOaa	Actually I enjoy McDonald's. First of all, I like their triple thick shakes and they definitely have the best fries. But what I like most about McDonald's is that they allow me to frolic in their men's rooms for hours at a time!|`|caLTvYaDaa	i hate mc Donald's it is so fatty and you do not know how old there oil is <br>  <br>  <br>  and i don't  work there|`|QzjKOduOaa	I love the price and the taste, but not how i feel after ive eaten there =S|`|AA10275738	Why do you ask? did you have a problem there?

I feel terrible after eating there.|`|xQwFZ3MQaa	i hate that place so much;|`|AA10263833	Yes.  That is correct!|`|NQRpubTeaa	it's ok. i much prefer arby's or subway, though.|`|zfqTvqSUaa	My McDonalds relationship is love-hate|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	I do. The quality has gone down in recent years. Too many illegal mexicans working there.|`|a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	I doesn't make me sick to eat there, but not my favorite place, either.  I don't mind the salads, usually get them and a bottle of water, if I am with someone and they choose that we eat there.  Salads are far healthier than most of the menu.|`|fc56bbca111b6dbda688dc4ca553eb32aa	Yes!  My parents have taken my 3 year old son there a few times and he's always begging to go eat there so to humor him I'll get him a salad and a small french fry but I'll feel like a horrible parent...|`|mj5rjmKxaa	I love Mcdonalds. Their fries are the best, and the Big Mac is one of the best fast food hamburgers. |`|DUg1IkTIaa	No, I don't hate McDonald's.  I have the Double Cheeseburger about 5 or 6 times a year. |`|Rib7vfJFaa	I only like the Mcflurries. That's basically the only thing on the menu I won't get sick from. Every now and then I MIGHT get something from the breakfast menu but since they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 am where I live, it's hard to get it. So i just stay off there food as much as i can. For fast food I usually prefer Arby's or Jack in the box. |`|fG1KAbGSaa	i love the palce. . i dont feel anything unusual about their food. .you work there and you hate it?why do you even work there?|`|4X45kCj4aa	well if everytime, you eat it you get sick, don't eat there anymore!!!!|`|Yk78fDlGaa	They seem to have improved here now i love Maccas they have a great variety|`|yOUTdmfDaa	I don't hate it, they have some good stuff.<br>  <br>  =]|`|8Koyt5zJaa	ewww that place is crap!|`|XiNaBr9Haa	meee|`|Vyw9fsFkaa	it's not my favorite place, and those commercials get on my last nerve
fc56bbca111b6dbda688dc4ca553eb32aa	You apply if you're attractive and you can handle taking orders and knowing the menu...you'll get hired...|`|mj5rjmKxaa	How do you have to be? You have to be nice to customers or else you won't get good tip. Also, wear push up bras that show your cleavage, if your boobs are not big enough, try to stuff it with something, oh and you have to look sexy sitting on a stool, as that is what you sit on when they interview you during your application. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|DplSekOyaa	You need to have big boobs. Just go apply and if you're skinny and have a big rack then you'll get the job. |`|HFbY9PYzaa	Just make your boobs appear bigger and pretend flirt with the customers who are mostly guys and the money will flow.|`|MOG0Q8kiaa	very carefully|`|HTku4NPXaa	you sound qualified already.. just ask for a app..|`|jRhjZQM7aa	get an application between 2 pm and 5 pm (the slowest time of the day for restaurants) sometimes they'll interview on the spot so be ready.  you know if you have the figure or not to work there, you don't really need huge breasts, but if you can stuff them and make them look believable to be bigger then go ahead (i know a few waitress who do this)|`|fG1KAbGSaa	wOw. .i think ur interested!haha!!!as long as you want it u gt it!just wear sexy clothes or better not wear any!|`|AA10275738	If you look like a model it will help or just have a nice shape esp. on top.|`|U88EIr0saa	U APPLY FOR A FU(KING JOB!!!!!!!!SO GET 1 U HOBO @$$!!|`|kJMtU3eOaa	how to you change an ice cream? why are ducks?|`|WNoXPtudaa	be freaky and nice i guess|`|xQwFZ3MQaa	apply for a job<br>  ?|`|4X45kCj4aa	hmm, how do you work?<br>  <br>  HMM i wonder!!!!
6DHaGOm0aa	You should get three so you have six I think it would be hard to finish eight pieces. It's really your call, make sure you get some delicious biscuits and some awesome cajun fries. I'm craving popeyes now, guess I'll go get some, good luck with yours!|`|AA10357276	Yes, and actually I would just get the Red Beans and Rice! It's really good. I don't eat chicken when I go there, I just order a side of Red Beans and Rice with a biscuit. I recommend it.|`|RSoR7kijaa	Idk about what you talking about but I know their shrimp/fries/biscuit combo is the sh*t!!!|`|l6RDDidsaa	go to KFC instead|`|ihY1tFiqaa	Go with the 3, and get an onion loaf with it.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	That's a good price.   I just obtained a menu, and it appears that PopEyes has an "Early Week Special" (Mon, Tues, Wed) and you get an 8-piece mixed chicken for only $5.99, so you got the chicken at a better price.  <br>  <br>  We don't have a PopEyes yet, but one just opened in the city south of where I live.  I might make a trip over there just to obtain first-hand info about their food and service.|`|APlHxUhxaa	yes!<br>  i LOVE Popeye's!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  KFC is disgusting.<br>  i don't support animal cruelty.
AA10275738	I do believe if you would give them a call. they would bt glad to tell you unless it;s secret receipt, |`|YnNhr3eIaa	It's kind of like a Roumelade sauce. Tiger Sauce made by Tulkoff's may be the exact copy. Restaurant Depot or some store in the STrip may have it.

It's like fast food for the upper class LOL.  Lots of professionals in my town will only eat there when they pick up fast food.  It's just too pricey, and then 2 hours later my husband's eating again because it's not very filling.  I hate their fry-things.  The sandwiches are edible but not worth the price.  They have great milkshakes and their breakfast is better than the other menu.|`|pueeMH6gaa	No, the food there is revolting. The sandwiches are made with re-steamed tasteless pressed meat of some sort.|`|AA11091315	It's ok. I don't see how people rave about it the way they do. Although they have everyone beat on that Polynesian sauce.|`|jsxphZJEaa	No, I do not. They are greasy and they do not have good flavor.|`|AA11865915	They're ok, but a little on the pricey side for a fast food place if you ask me.|`|z7MPaUELaa	I've never been to one. I've never even seen one before.|`|AA11767076	I used to, but their quality has changed in the past year or so :(|`|SjGpbohiaa	No I don't.|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	not too much.|`|EfaM4yf0aa	yummy but my mom said their food is 2 pricy|`|LSqHgFBDaa	no|`|AaXl3vcCaa	i have not had it since high school but ya i liked it then|`|AaknZ1RHaa	The chicken sandwich sometimes is a bit greasy.
