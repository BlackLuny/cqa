20090203091131AANmThO	Health;Mental Health	Bipolar bf...confusing the heck out of me?	See my previous question on this....      I am not used to bipolar disorder...I am and have been living with a bipolar man for a year. We finally considered ourselves a couple in November...when he suddenly decided he wanted it.      I have to manage all finances...hes not on meds...but one thing I cant seem to handle lately is the inconsistency with feelings. He says he cares alot about me and doesnt kno how to love...he says hes never happy. Also he seems to go through phases where one week he sends me sweet messages a lot...the next week he cant seem to tolerate seeing me. We used to cuddle on the couch and go do things alot..but since he works all the time now and has a band...we never hang out...but he seems to think seeing me whenever he comes home is enough..I dont get it..is it because he is untreated...how can he love me one week and not seem to care if i am there the next...      how are bipolar people in relationships and how do you cope with them...someone told me that they tend to blame their problems on those closest to them...and hes been doing that alot..seems like i never do anything right..even tho i do so much for him.      I love him...i just dont know what to do...his inconsistency sometimes makes me jealous of everything else going on in his life...but it could just be his bipolar thing.

I have a girlfriend I'm very close to, and we cuddle a lot and make out on the couch occasionally (but we're saving sex for marriage). A lot of times I'll get an erection at intervals during the time we spend together. But about an hour after she leaves, I feel like Mohammad Ali gave me a shot straight to the ball sack. They ache really bad. I examined them and the vessels that connect the actual testicle to my body (vas deferens I think) are really swollen and sensitive. It sounds like blue balls and it's awful. Is there any way to relieve it other than sex and masturbation?

My mom's dad was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 84-85 ish 3 years ago and he died shortly after....and the cancer spread and was all over. Well my mom is 53 and she went today to see a gastro-something doctor and he wants to send her for a colonoscopy in about a month and I am so scared. He said it's a preventive measure since her father had colon cancer. And he said that if she has polyps, he'll remove them but does it mean he suspects cancer ? I am so scared, I'm 22 and just so scared for her. Can it just be that she has nothing? I am so scared and I have bad anxiety and now my anxiety is just a thousand times more. Does polyps mean cancer ? I am sooo scared she may have those polyps

The doctor wants to put me on a high fiber diet. The hardest part of the colonoscopy was drinking the prep stuff that made me go have to take a poop every 10 minutes or so. That prep drink was sooooo awful. I didn't leave the hospital until 1:05 P.M. The doctor gave me some butt cream to put on my butt and he said to use it until its gone. I'm feeling good right now but I have been sleeping all day since I got home and I ate a little bit of food.

20090220205505AAguunG	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	What could this be?--right side abdominal pain?	I have been having right side abdominal pain for over a year now, and it has progressively gotten worse. When it gets really bad, i also spike a fever. Recently, it has also been having spasms where it "rumbles & vibrates", it almost feels like something is about to explode. the pain is severe, and it is like tearing and throbbing, it's very hard to explain the sensation. any advice would be greatly appreciated. i have been to many different doctors, and they can find nothing. i also have a history of gastric ulcers and severe food allergies...i don't know if that has anything to do with this.my bowels are normal. and i eat very healthy (i'm under a dietician). it's really acting up right now and it also hurts to walk and move or do anything, i have a fever of 101.5. help please. like i said, i have been to many doctors, and have many tests done (most of which were performed a year ago) and everything has come back seemingly normal, but now it's so much worse. like i feel like im going to throw up i just feel horrible. help! i have been avoiding all of the foods that i am allergic to so i don't think that that has anything to do with my side pain. i have also get hives/rash when it hurts really bad. they are just red spots that aren't really raised. i also have poor circulation, and my legs are almost purple, but i'm not overweight at all!   i am a 16 year old female, and i have had sonograms, x-rays, blood work, ct scan. most of which were over a year ago, and it's getting progressively worse. but the docs say that it doesn't have anything to do with my cycle. oh and i've also had 2 endoscopys for my gastric ulcers that were caused by food allergies, but since i have kept the offending foods out of my diet, the ulcers have gone away. so, i don't think that this contributes to my side pain. i really would like to get to the bottom of this, i have some more doctors appointments, but they are giving up as well. i can barely sleep the pain is so bad. i can barely walk, and when i do i walk with a limp cuz i can't put full pressure on my right leg (same side as the abdominal pain). the pain is like parallel to my belly button, not right by my ribs though, it's kinda between my rib and pelvic bone, more so right in the part where there are no bones. but if it was appendecitis, wouldn't they have found something by now?

I walk for hours a day and cut my eating habits but I haven't seen any changes at all even though I know I have a calorie deficit of quite a bit.

Now that I am watching my diet and eating less and healthy, I'm not seeing any changes. Should I try to walk even MORE?   Because I don't think 4-5 hours of walking a day is possible.

Is it common for early multiple sclerosis symptoms to come and go within hours or minutes, or do symptoms usually last weeks before remitting.  For example, tingling in the legs that stays for 20 minutes but then goes away, and comes back 5 hours later.  Or tingling in the fingers that stays for 6 hours, goes away for 15 minutes, and returns later in the day. Sometimes it could be mild, or sometimes more noticeable, then it will decrease or increase by the hour.  Or tingling the face that lasts seconds and goes away.

20090220213627AAbzlhu	Health;Dental	Would my root canal filling need to be redone for a crown?	I am in need of a crown on a root canal filled tooth. That is ok, I knew this was going to happen so was prepared for it. I was asked to return to the dentist to have my tooth prepped and the mould would be taken for the crown. However when I went to the dentist for this procedure, less than a week after my original appointment, I was seen by a different Dentist who insisted on looking at my teeth again. She said that my root canal filling would need to be redone. I don't fully understand why but I think she was saying there is not enough filling at the bottom to hold the post for the crown.    I would be grateful if anyone in the know would let me know their thoughts. What worries me is the initial dentist said nothing of this so why has it come about now? In addition the new dentist also said I needed 4 fillings (again no mention of this on my first visit). I am just a little bit wary, why didn't the first dentist pick up on these things? Do I really need the work done? Should I go somewhere else for a second opinion? To top off all the bad news when I was leaving I was told my gums would need to be cut away for the crown - is this common practice?   I am not very good with having any work done on my teeth, I can never relax so am always a bit scared to go to be honest. I'm living in China at the moment so my fear is slightly heightened going to a dentist in an unfamiliar country. I would really appreciate any words of wisdom.   Thanks.

And is there anything else I can do for my poor baby?      Thank you.

20090220164024AA9ZaGf	Health;Other - Health	Been having health issues, help?	okay for already a year and 3 months i've been feeling this way.       Cracking joints [back hurts, back cracks, arms, everything cracks]   something my vision gets blurry, and i have trouble thinking   feel out of bodied, bad bad headaches sometimes. and I easily get annoyed, and startled easily by sounds.   racing thoughts   trouble thinking/focusing, etc.   sometimes its after i eat.   If I drink caffine I feel like i am going crazy.         I've been to the doctor, he ran full blood work on me, checked my thyroid, Anemia, HIV, etc.      I was even having pain in my stomach area, so the doctor requested i get a colonscopy to check if i had any infection, or parasites. They found nothing.      he then requested i go see a neurologist, and a cardiologist. I went to the neruologist and he asked if i had a cat scan before- and I said I have when I first started to feel weird- I got one done and found nothing. He then didn't bother checking me any furture, and perscribed me TOPAMAX, which I am refusing to take cause that medicine is to prevent seizures and prevent migraines. And I read if you all of the sudden stop taking that medication you can have very bad side effects. You can also not mix the medication with other medications. so if i do find out what is wrong with me I cannot take another medication. Also i'm twenty and i'm turning 21 on march 22- so I want to drink :P.      No clue- I feel as if i am going crazy. My family on my fathers side suffers from Manic Depression, maybe I could have symptoms of that?      I don't know. I find myself stressing, worrying, etc- but that just started after I started feeling weird.

We got home and my mother, a nurse, absolutely went balistic and then fell apart. (She's actually crying on my bed right now while I ask this question.) She's afraid my sister will get MRSA in her nose and needs to know if she should remove the ring and allow it to heal up without the jewelry, or if that could make things worse?      Or do you think it would be okay to leave the piercing alone, so long as she cleans it with religious fervor?

So heres the deal...I have fair, sensitive skin that is combination- it is oily around my chin, forehead, and nose, but also it can get a bit dry on my nose and forehead. I tend to break out mostly on my forehead, nose and chin and sometimes right next to my nose on my cheeks. I have bad black heads on my nose also :( I would really like to fix these problems, but I do not know how to decide which skin care products to use.    My typical routine is: washing my face (in the morning and at night) with Olay, Boscia, or whatever face wash I have at the time. I know that it is better to have a set plan and use the same products, but i can't decide! If I have a really bad breakout, I sometimes will use PersaGel 10 but i don't like it very much bc it is harsh on my skin and i sometimes react with red burning flush. (oh and also I tend to pick at my skin if I have a bad breakout which i know it makes it worse and I am getting better at not doing it)   My mom recently offered to buy me a skin care system, but I am decided what to do...I am considering a few different brands: Proactiv, Aveeno, and Skin ID by neutrogena. I am afraid Proactiv will be harsh and dry out my skin. With Aveeno- I don't know much about but would like to know more and if it works well. Skin ID seems like a brilliant idea bc its personalized, but it is expensive so i want to make sure that i know about if it works. Please give me some advice on what works, your personal experiences, etc. Thanks!

20090220181230AAAoje7	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart monitor question (holter / ecg)?	I'm wearing a 48 hour holter monitor per my doctor currently because I've had chest discomfort lately and feeling like skipping heartbeats. For some reason the heartbeat skips only happen in the evening.      I had an echocardiogram done today at the cardiology center, but I felt fine at the time. The cardiologist looked briefly at it and said it looks completely normal and that he'll look in further detail later. Now (4 hours later) I'm feeling like my heartbeat skips every now and then when I feel my pulse in my throat. When it seems to skip I get this strange feeling in my throat, kinda like the feeling you get when you're about to throw up yet it's not nausea.      What could cause irregular heart beats just in the evening? It's happened the past few evenings. My EKG was fine as well, and my blood pressure is always 116/122 over 76/82. 24 male non smoker.      I'm paranoid my heart is going to skip a beat and not continue.      What would cause irregular heartbeats just in the evening?      Another reason I'm paranoid about it is that my heart beat is like 65-68 right now so it's rather slow and so when my beat does skip it scares me.      I'm feeling real anxious right now... it wouldn't hurt if I went out and had a couple drinks to calm down would it?

20090220181557AAe3Ywv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Moved a few months ago. Suddenly, I get a stuffy nose when I'm in my bedroom.?	I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Then, a week ago, I started having a stuffy nose whenever I went in the room. He still lives with his parents, and I don't like the rest of the family, so I don't like leaving the room for more than a few minutes. A few days ago, I insisted on cleaning the room, picking up EVERYTHING off the floor and vacuuming EVERYWHERE. It didn't help. If I open the window and sit right by it, I can breathe a little better, but it gets cold fast. I do have asthma, but my inhaler doesn't help. I haven't slept well in a week, and it's really affecting me at work. What can I do?   * Nothing smells out-of-the-ordinary bad (the whole house smells funny because nobody takes care of the rest of the house. But, I take care of my bedroom).   * I did wash the bedding.   * I know I didn't just do a poor job of cleaning. I was taught how to clean properly.   * I can't afford to move out.   * I have lived there for 3 months without problems and they haven't changed the detergent they buy or anything like that.   * They do have animals, but I've never had problems with pets before and again, would it really take that long to get symptoms from pet allergies?

And today, I don't know why, I sat down at my desk and all of a sudden my chest seemed to flutter and I could feel my throat pulsing.  My vision blurred slightly and I had to catch my breath for some reason.   I'm on Yasmin and I take fish oil among my other regular vitamin and mineral supplements, if that is a help.   I eat healthy, I am on average BMI, and do a half hour cardio about three times a week or more if I have the time.   I don't want to have to go to the doctor and pay a $40 dollar co pay to have them not even try to diagnose me or take me seriously, so if you have any suggestions that I can bring up with them or if you can save me a trip, I would appreciate it so much!

20090220191326AAl0d9m	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	I have genital herpes help?	I was diagnosed with it yesterday by my doctor.  They're doing a culture to make sure, but the doctor said he was pretty sure that it was herpes.  Me and my boyfriend have had oral sex, but we have not gone farther than that.  I know it's possible to get it from doing that, but it was just such a shock.  I'm only 16 and I'm a virgin.  It seems so unfair.  I have been with my boyfriend for almost 10 months and we have been doing oral sex for a while and this is my first outbreak.  Neither of us have cheated and it just seemed like this wouldn't happen to people who were careful.  I feel so depressed whenever I think about how this will affect the rest of my life.  No guy will ever want to be with me.  Most of my friends probably would never talk to me again if they knew.  I just feel so ashamed.  It's so unfair how I'm a virgin and I got this STD and people who sleep around without using protection are perfectly fine.  Please nobody tell me how stupid I am or whatever, I just need support right now.  Even my mom hasn't been much of a help.

20090220202141AAPbLjR	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	I think I might have diabetes?	Well im having the signs.  I have always had blurred vision sometimes like when I get up and stuff but i thought everyone did when they just wake up sometimes. Also my hands were kinda numb yesterday, which is another symptom. But these two are not to the extreme and could just be a fluke.    These are a little more certain:   I have been extremely thirsty lately and have been constantly urinating (sorry if that is too much information) ..   So do you think I could have diabetes? Im pretty young so im kinda frightened, and diabetes does not run in my family. Also how long should I wait to see if the symptoms continue before I go see the doctor (I have had the blurriness for a really long time, but the thirstyness and constant urination has just happened for about 2/3 weeks)? Because I want to be sure and make sure that its not all just a fluke, because the doctor is very far away.

20090220203724AAMnSTL	Health;Dental	Expander problem? Please help?!?!?	I've had my expander in since November and I stopped turning it right before Christmas. It's getting really lose and wiggling though.    My brothers girlfriend told me that when she had rapid pallet expanders once her soft pallet healed the expanders broke since there wasn't any pressure on them.    My orthodontist didn't tell me anything about that happening, is that how they still work? (She had hers 7 years ago) Is it a problem that my expanders lose? I don't go back to my orthodontist till April.

I don't think I have time for that many, five is all I can see fitting. If you could tell me the best times to eat those small meals, that would help a lot! And if you could throw in some examples of what I could eat during each of the small meals, that would great too. I need to exercise too. My target points are, well, everywhere. What are some good workouts for legs (upper mostly, like thighs and hips), arms, abs... I just want to be much skinnier and as fast as possible. Prom is in April on the 18th. I want to look good. Because as of now, I dont think I'm gonna go. But if I look good in a prom dress that might change my mind. Plus I need to be healthier. I can eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables but I'm having a hard time cutting out Dr.Pepper. If there is a tasty alternative that is healthier that doesn't include any type of flavor packages or diet drinks, then that would be cool too. Please please please help me!?

There's this guy I've liked for a long time, but whenever I hang out with him, or see him (non-sexual way), I usually feel unsatisfied, or depressed.      There is this other guy that I just met.

I've liked the first guy for 6 years, and I only met the other guy 2 days ago.      Sorry about any confusion and the length of this.      Oh, by the way, since this has more mental feelings and issues, I decided to ask it in the Mental Health section as well.

20090220195847AA5UkKp	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Do I have a problem with my throat?	Okay, before I go on with my story, I'd like you all to know that; 1-I have a peanut allergy. 2-I get sore throats 6-8 times a year (This has been happening my whole life.      Okay, so I was sitting down eating some beef w/ vegetable soup. All of a sudden, I got a sharp pain in my neck. Then, I started sneezing crazily....really, 18-25 times in a row! Then, the pain wouldn't let up. I figured I burned my throat, or got something stuck in my neck. So, I went downstairs and sprayed some soothing spray in my mouth...It didn't help, which is weird. It's been like 3 hours since then, and the pains really let up a lot. I found that it wasn't as much in my neck, as it was in the far back of my mouth that the pain was occurring in. I think I may have burned that area with the stew. But, it could also be that there was something that triggered an allergic reaction in it. But, it's been hours, and I am generally fine. Though, the pain is still there, and it does bloody hurt....but not nearly as bad...I can swallow without a of pain. I am not sure...      Should I be worried about it? Or, does anyone know what it may be? Like I said, the pains still there....but it's less painful than before. I can breath fine and stuff....      It's troubling because I usually can figure these things out, but I am stuck here. If it keeps up, I'll go to the doctor tomorrow. But, like I said....it was weird because it happened within minutes. I went from fine, to extreme pain.       That covers it...hope someone can help me.            QUESTION(S)-Should I be worried about this, strongly?                         -Should I be scared it has something to do with my allergy, and even though it's  been hours, it may cause some trouble?

20090220200236AAWrdXy	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	Smashed fingernail falling off...sort of?	ABout a month ago I smashed my finger in a dorr. I drained the blood underneath using a needle to relieve the pressure, but the nail is still coming. The problem is about 3/4 of the nail is completely loose and even separated from the nail bed at the cuticle. The remaing 1/4 of the nail is still healthy and attached to the nail bed as usual. My issue is that this 1/4 of the nail runs vertically up the entire side of my nail bed. This means even though the rest of the nail is loose it could take months for it to actually fall off because that portion remains attached, Is there a way I can remove it with less pain than simply ripping it off like a bandage? Leaving it this way is incredibly awkward and Im afraid if I dont removie I will eventually catch it on something not paying attention when it is uncovered and that will hurt much more. Any ideas guys?

20090220200507AAup3lx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	A scenario involving SSRI/SNRI administration in serotonin positive carcinoid syndrome (please read on)?	Consider someone who has yet to be diagnosed with serotonin positive carcinoid. Reasons for seeking medical attention include: "flushing", diarrhea, and an atypical symptom like, nausea. The primary GP, whilst investigating possible etiologies thorough various imaging and serum modalities, prescribes a low dose SNRI until test results can be ascertained. Perhaps, under the working hypothesis of IBS, anxiety, or simply as a means to provide relief from suffering (i.e, the aforementioned sxs) via the anticholinergic properties of a given SNRI.      If a person who actually had serotonin carcinoid syndrome took these meds, what would you expect would happen? Serotonin syndrome? A paradoxical reaction? Exacerbation of primary sxs? Something else?      BTW: Not a personal Q. Just curious :-).

20090220202230AACbLUF	Health;Alternative Medicine	Where should I be going with pediatric neurology?	I am interested in pediatric neurology.  I have wanted to be a pediatrician since I was about six years old, and I am now fifteen and have specified it to pediatric neurology.  I am a sophomore in high school, and I would like to know what specific classes i should be taking.  My want for this kind of career is stronger than ever, but I can't seem to find the right information I need.   I know science and math classes are a given, but what kind?   And what colleges/universities would be best for studying this kind of medicine, both undergrad and med school?   I live right outside of Philadelphia, so Penn is only a 20 minute drive down the street.  CHOP is also a quick drive from my house.      This is kind off-topic, but I was recently given a private tour with my mother of the new NICU at CHOP before it opened, and I have to say... I was completely blown away, absolutely astounding!  I wouldn't have expected anything less.      I attend one of the largest high schools on the East Coast, also one of the largest in the country, so needless to say my science and math electives are almost endless.  My school offers many "specialty" courses in bulk such as child development, psychology, medical co-op, etc.   I just need a little direction from someone who know what they're talking about... Any specialists or professors out there would be a great help!

I don't have any real experience with the US health care system so help me understand this hypothetical scenario:      Sam has recently become broke. Sam has also recently become mugged of his (empty) wallet. At the time of the crime, upon finding the wallet empty, Sam's mugger becomes "pissed off" and decides the best course of action is to stab Sam. A good samaritan finds Sam bleeding in the street and calls an ambulance. Sam is then taken to the emergency room of a hospital where his wounds are properly tended to. Now, Sam has no money to pay for this treatment. So...what happens there? Does poor, recently broke, recently stabbed Sam get sent to jail? If not, are emergency rooms and the treatments they offer there free?

20090220205447AA4Dx44	Health;Diet & Fitness	Please please please help me with this. I'm desperate =[?	Okay well since October 16th 2008 ive been dieting and exercising vigorously. I weighed 147 lbs at 5'6 back then, and now I weigh 134. I really need to be 130 by March 16th because that's when I'm going shopping and I want to buy nice fitting clothes. My weight loss has become very slow since January though. So it's been a week and I took out whole-wheat roti (indian type of whole wheat bread) and indian type cooked vegetables because I felt they weren't allowing me to lose weight. Though, I'm starting to feel really tired now and I don't have the same energy to exercise.      I am only eating the following foods   Fish, milk, almonds, fruits, special K cereal, eggs (scrambled) and chicken breast sometimes.      My exercise routine is:   Running for 15 mins at 5.4 mp   Biking for 15 mins   Eleptical 15-20 mins   and 50 crunches and some strength training.      Was it a wise decision to take out the bread, and indian style cooked veggies (I'm sure they are a lot of calories) I really need to be 130 lbs =[

I had sex with a guy and he was only the 2nd guy ive had sex with & im almost 24. He used a condom, but it broke & he gave me HPV and Genital Herpes. He lied to me & told me he was STD free. He doesn't look like a nasty guy at all. He is really good looking, has a good job, nice house, you would never know he had a STD by looking at him. Now I feel like my life is over. I feel like I can never be with another guy again because I feel ashamed. I feel like the rest of my life I will be alone because no one will want me. I didn't think this would ever happen to me. It's sad to think I will be alone forever. I just don't know if I can deal with it anymore. Im so afraid of being alone. I would never commit suicide, but I wish I would go to sleep at night and not wake up in the morning. I dont know how to deal with this. How can I deal with this?

20090203092214AAX4Ce8	Health;Diet & Fitness	What more can I do to be healthy?	A series of health emergencies among relatives recently spurred me into motion to make myself a healthier person.    I have drastically reduced the volume of food I take in out of an attempt to counter-act my naturally slow metabolism. I now eat one meal a day at roughly 4:30pm. Normally this consists of one serving of fruit, 2 servings of vegetables, one serving of meat, one serving of dairy, and 2 servings of breads or pastas. If I get hungry throughout the day I snack on a head of lettuce that I keep in the fridge. I also walk 2 miles a day simply to get to lectures on time.   I'm 5'11" and weigh almost 250lbs. so I am fairly obese. I have a BMI of 34.2 and I am hoping to reduce that to approximately a 25.8.   My heart rate is low, and my blood pressure is within healthy levels, but my family has a rather extensive history of diabetes and heart disease that I would like to avoid.    I do not smoke, drink alcohol, or take any other form of illegal or prescription drug. I do however take in an inordinate amount of caffeine in various forms. This being the only vice I have not been able to part with yet. I am, however, attempting to shift to caffeinated teas rather than carbonated sodas.       After almost 2 months of this, I have yet to notice any significant loss of weight, or even a feeling of well being. In contrast, I have actually been struck by a severe case of insomnia.      Am I doing something wrong? If not, what additional steps can I take? any and all suggestions are welcome.

20090220204658AAbWDvK	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does the Female Bodybuilding world need another Tina Lockwood?	For those who don’t know.  Tina Lockwood was a heavyweight female bodybuilder in the early to mid 1990s before abruptly retiring.  She had incredible size at 5’7” and weighing about 180lbs.  Her arms were about 18” and her thighs were about 30”, unreal stats in the female bb world.  However, before all you cynics shout roids, just remember she was not suspected of using.  She was big the whole time and benefited from good genetics.  Tina Lockwood also never developed the tell tale signs of steroid abuse like a deepening voice or a masculinized face.        I ask this question because I think female bodybuilding could last even without the roids and heavy testing.  There are genetic wonders out there such as this woman and if a new super woman came in to fill the void, it could help prove that women can join the world of bodybuilding without sacrificing their femininity.

I'm in high school, nothing has ever resurfaced, and I'm content with my life.      The question is, if I wanted to go into psychology, psychiatry, anything in the mental health field, would this past be likely to impact how effective I am at the the occupation, or if I even get a job or into college for it? Would it impact me in any way concerning this, really?      Thanks a lot for the help.

I am 20 and I have never had a problem with zits.    recently I went a month without birth control and then switched to a new birth control and since then I've had a ton of problems, to make it all worse the face soap I've always used changed their formula and now it's doing nothing for my face.       I only get zits on my forehead, so thankfully my bangs cover them mostly and it's not a big deal except they hurt and I'm just not used to having zits. it's really getting to me :(      things that are probably contributing:   1. hormones, I don't like the bc I'm on   2. stress, school and family have been stressing me a lot lately.    3. I have no idea what products to use      so, can someone please tell me what products they've had results with? I'd like a soap and an exfoliating scrub type of thing. I'm not a huge fan of things that don't foam, I feel like they do nothing.       ps... I do NOT have the money for like proactive or anything like that.

Well, I've been playing the guitar, and usually I get blisters on the tip of my fingers on my left hand, but for the piece I was playing, it required plucking.   My fingers started to sting from all the plucking, so I decided to take a break.   As the sting starts to go away, I notice there was a little white bump on the tip of my ring finger.   I didn't know what it was so I rubbed it and it stung A LOT.   What do I do?   I want to continue practicing, but it hurts ):

In human biology books it says one of the main reasons we all evolved curvy round-shaped butts was so that we had something that behaved as a cushion when we sat down on it.

My friends has the most flat shaped behind and always complains of getting butt aches when she sits for more than 15 minutes!

20090220211133AAUfJGj	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Can I die from acid reflex?	I'm a 15 year old female and have...   Acid Reflux   Gastritis   Espohagitis   Lactose Intolerance      Okay my stomach doctor told me that the experience I get is the acid reflux. Let me try to explain this experience. I get the sudden urge to vomit and my glands swell up. I also have trouble breathing or completely stop breathing. I don't stop breathing on purpose. My body just won't let me breathe. It's scary because I don't know if I'll regain my breathe again. This isn't caused by a panic attack!!! This actually happens during normal situations. Unlike people with asthma I don't have an inhaler to make me better. I just have myself and hope that I'll regain my breathe. I usually spend a minute completely breath less and 5 minutes wheezing after that while feeling the need to vomit. I know that it's getting worse and I know that there may be a time when I may not regain my breathe. i hate it because it interferes with my life because I have to stop everthing I'm doing and go to the bathroom and try to wait it out. Which is awkward in a highschool bathroom when someone else is there and they hear me wheeze. I wish I was normal and didn't have to go through this. My mom said that if it keeps worsening I could get cancer.  I'm due for an endoscopy soon... wish me luck. Hopefully I won't get worse.

I have done some research on nose jobs and it seems that around the age of 16 your nose has pretty much stopped growing, so wouldn't it be safe to get one? and also, i have both of my parents consent and i have thought about getting one and wanted one greatly for at least 3 years now. I definitely have thought about the risks but i think there is way more of a positive outcome from it than negative.      So should i get a nose job?

20090220205055AA5qmgs	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is it legal for a doctor to find out what medications I am taking?	I am seeing a orthopedic surgeon for a few things and he has me on Vicodin. My PCP also has been giving me another medication that does not have so much acetaminophen. I have a lot of pain in several areas and my ortho doctor has prescribed 3 other medications as well which are non-narcotics. One of them is Lyrica. The 3 other ones make me real tired and spacey.       Also, I found out that one can legally get a DUI when on one of those other 3 medications, but not Vicodin. Also, the Vicodin does not make me sleepy or "spaced out". In fact, it does the opposite. I don't "feel" anything when taking it. It helps the pain and therefore, I can do more things. More "normal" things like a "normal human being".      The Vicodin only helps one of my problems and the other narcotic helps the other for whatever reason.      The other day someone from my doctor's office called me and said that "they have a web site" and she found out that I was getting this other narcotic from my PCP (primary doctor) at a different drug store.      Does anyone know if there is such a web site? I don't know all what HIPPA entails but doesn't that protect me? Or is that null and void if it is a doctor checking on what medication I am on?      Maybe it is because it is a narcotic? I have no idea. She said I signed a Pain Management contract. Actually she said she thought I did and then she said she hoped I did. I found a copy of a pain management contract on the aapain management site and it doesn't look familiar to me. If I did sign it, I must have forgotten and it could have been years ago.       Also, does anyone know if I am supposed to get a copy of the agreement? Thanks!

My skin color is tan and I've been spending alot of time in the sun I guess, because of sports and I have been getting darker. Part of my bicep and rest of the arm, my calves and my face (excluding the ears since I have long hair and it's covering them) are darker then my chest, thighs and ears, and I just want to know how to get my darker places lighter so it can be the same color as my regular tan color, but I don't know what to do. I don't know if staying away from the sun and just staying at home does any good, but I might be wrong so I don't know, Can anyone tell me how to get my skin lighter?

Sometimes when I'm sitting, it feels like I'm rocking back and forth. I've also been dealing with a bit of nausea. My ears aren't very itchy. Just a little, but I put a cotton swab (I know that's bad. I know) and the stuff that came out was... gross. Thick and dark brown.       Anyway, I'm allergic to penicillin, and I know most likely, they would prescribe amoxicillin. I can't take that. What would they most likely prescribe, and what would the general price range be?       I do not have insurance, though I am a student. My visit would be free and I would have to pay the prescription. Any advice would be grateful. Thank you!

20090220213730AAyR6pS	Health;Mental Health	This is anoying me. I dont know what im doing.?	OK so i was really depressed for a while. I dont know if i did it out of depression or bordom or i dont even know why i did it. I know for a while before i was thinking about cutting but i would never actually do it...i think. Anyway like two nights ago i was using thumb tacs to pin up a poster and i was playing with one, it occured to me how sharp these things actually are. So i started pushing it into the top part of my wrist ( not the inside were people usually cut the top right between my hand and arm.)  I wanted to see how far it would go. Well it didnt go very far, its kind of hard to break the skin with it, plus i may have used it before so it could have been dull. Either way i started scraping it in a line along my wrist from that one point. It started to bleed a little after a while. I stopped and washed off my wrist. The next night i had the box of thumb tacs on my desk, i started playing with them again and started breaking up the cuts that had started healing from the night before. I made the cut bigger and longer. its not like one cut its a bunch of small ones really close together. It started to bleed alot more. Once again i stopped after a while. Now though i look at it and it makes me think like im a cutter or something. I really dont think im like that though, cause in my mind i know thats stupid. My mom did it for a brief period and i always hated it. I cant stand looking at it though and now im really self concious people will think im like that or something since its not really easy to hide even if i wear a long sleeve shirt. It looks like from a distance that it could be one cut from a knife.  I dont even know why im going into this much detail am i like masocistic or something! I have no idea. Still, i dont like how it looks  but im tempted to do it to my other wrist in the same place. I dont know im just really confused. Whats a good way to make these urges go away.
20090220214050AA4T7op	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I'm Starting To Lose the Feeling On My Skin?	Today I slowly began to realize that my skin feels different. When I rub my arms or touch any other part of my body (face, neck, etc.) it feels like it's not my skin. It's similar to the feeling you get in a limb when it falls asleep. I've never had this sensation before, and it just started today. I'm OK with it, it just feels a little weird. Does anyone know about this, and, even more important, do I need to see a doctor about it? I can deal with it, but if there's comething wrong I need to get it checked out.

20090220214933AAe5VB7	Health;Dental	Baby teeth with braces on?	ive had braces for two years and a few months, im pretty sure that the teeth on both sides of my two front teeth are baby teeth and they're no permanent teeth underneath.   Wasnt the doctor suppose to pull those before the braces got on?   right now i have coiled wire across those teeth on both sides and triangle rubber bands from canine to the bottom.   (theres a space between my second tooth from the front tooth and the canine, that wasnt there before so the doctor did this purposely?)   what do you think my dentist is going to do because he has to do something right?   the teeth are visibly smaller than the rest so im going to be very disappointed if nothing is done, but i doubt this because my orthodontist is one of the best where i live.
20090220214658AAcK1Aq	Health;Mental Health	I'm having a lot of trouble coping with years of unsupportive parents. Any tips?	Im general, my parents are great parents. However, about four years ago was when my OCD first showed up. I literally compulsed about 2 hours each night. When I told my mother about it, she said I was just being weird. When I told my father about it, he told me I was just being weird. When the symptoms didn't go away, I addressed them many more times, each time with the same response, that I was just being "weird".      Then, a few months ago, my therapist actually believed me, and made a point to tell my parents I was right, I did have many symptoms of OCD. My family STILL didn't believe me. My dad went so far as to tell me I was being very insensitive to those who did have OCD.      Now I'm better, and trying to get past a lot of the trauma from my uncontrolled OCD, and their lack of support is still very hurtful. Many times I get mad at them for seemingly little reason, when really it is just harbored from the years they didn't believe me. I need some help overcoming this. Any tips?      Thanks! Sorry this was long.

I should tell you that I have reduced my food intake significantly, and I exercise more. I cannot reduce my food intake safely anymore, but I still have too much weight. This flab, not my delusion as to what I should look like, so believe me when I say I am not trying to turn my self into skin and bone.I actually happen to be very fond of my food...which is why it was so sad to part from most of it ;)..I know you might suggest eating a healthier diet, however, my budget only allows me to buy in bulk and make what I buy STRETCH. I will try when I come into some more money, but for now I just have to settle with what I have. Also, no dieting teas or other dieting programs, as my budget won't permit it.

20090220215609AAa9oGD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I would like to know if anyone know of any medical conditions with two or more of these symptoms?	i used to have cramps so severely that it was impossible to function, and I would end up in the hospital and I've nearly died.  My doctor practically demanded that I be put on birth control.  maybe a year after I was put on the pill I started having abdominal pains unlike cramps. I know what cramps feel like- the extreme kind and the mild kind and these pains aren't like that. they also happen every single day about once an hour lasting for about 30 to 45 seconds.  now i'm not getting my period.  this is the second month.  I haven't missed a single pill for at least the past 3 months and I'm ALWAYS on time.  I'm also having frequent headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.  I'm not diabetic or anything and I have a healthy diet.  I'm a vegetarian and love fruits, vegetables, and I eat "meat" products.  I consult my doctor regularly to make sure I'm getting the nutrients that I need: all the vitamins, calcium, protein, iron, etc. even if I have to take a pill for it. the pills I take are suggested by my doctor.  I'm not severely overweight. about 15 pounds and don't eat much junk food at all since I am trying to slim down a bit for the summer.  I also excersise a lot.  I'm always out horseback riding with my friend or walking the mountain trials/ hiking somwhere with a group of friends, walking my dog, etc.  A huge factor in this would probably be the fact that I AM a virgin.  There doesn't seem to be anything that I can say to get people to believe that a 17 going on 18 year old girl on the pill is a virgin, but I wouldn't lie about something like that when it could be such a huge factor in a situation like this.  My mom has taken me to the doctor several times because the test keep coming back strangely. all different kinds of tests. even the ultrasound she said was confusing. but they decided that nothing was wrong.  that was just before I stopped having my period.  the thing is, with the financial struggle going on my parents don't have the money to keep bringing me to the doctor for "strange" results. and dismissals.  My friend's dad is a doctor.  she spoke to him and the way she was talking to me about it I think he thinks I might have some kind of cancer and of course the thought has crossed my mind on my own.  I thought if there was something specific i could ask the doctors to check for, i would have a better chance at a productive visit. please help if you can. thanks.

20090220215811AAaRvbJ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	STD's???? need help.....?	If a guy were to have cold sores on his mouth and preformed oral sex on a girl could that transfer to her. I know cold sores are herpes simplex 1, so could she have a vaginal outbreak, and if so, is that genital herpes?
20090220215839AA9pnEg	Health;Alternative Medicine	Why is this pill the way it is?	Okay so I just moved into some new ghetto and trashy apartments and while i was on my porch I found a small 1" in length glass vile in the bushes. It was filled with tiny white rectangle pills imprinted with ETH on one side and 3 on the other. Did a little research and they are known as Nitrostat. I was wondering if anyone knew of maybe a narcotic purpose for them or some side effects... I just wanna know if they are like something really bad, I mean the way they are packaged and like thrown in some bushes... kinda odd.. any comments are appreciated!!
