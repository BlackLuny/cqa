20090227122051AAiB4Hw	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Where would I, Average Joe, go to use a phone in 1905 America?	I read that there were already 3 million phones in America in 1904. Who had them? How wide-spread were they? If I lived in a small town (not a large city, but not a 50-person farming town, either) where would I go to use a phone? Would many people have them in their homes? Businesses? Were public use phones available or was there a central service, like Western Union, that could receive and send phone calls for you?      I'm writing a piece set in the period and any help you could provide would be much appreciated. I've done my own research around the web and on sites like Wikipedia (where I found the 3 million number), but most places provide only how many phones there were, not how they were used or who had them. That's the angle I'm not finding.      Thanks in advance for any help you can give me!   (Cross-posted in Arts & Humanities -> History)

20090227123230AA4Ljg8	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	My pc sometimes fails when ingame can you help?	Hi. I built my computer about 2 months ago, primarily for gaming, and it has worked perfectly. Last week, it started turning itself off completely in the middle of games. With Fallout 3 and Left 4 Dead, it can last for around half an hour. With older games, it can last longer. It has previously been left on all day and done 10 hour gaming sessions with no problems, and some of those games have been moe demanding than Left 4 Dead. It can last for any amount of time when being used for other purposes, like watching videos. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have a Sapphire Radeon 3870, an AMD 8750 Tri-core processor, 4 GB of DDR2 800mhz RAM and 600 watt power supply. PS: The computer turns off completely and doesn't restart.

20070817091743AAMH3mv	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Can I connect to my existing ISP on my laptop with a cell phone?	Okay, here's what I'm wondering.  I just got off the phone with T-mobile.  I told them that I'm looking to get another cell phone and that I was wondering what the rates were for data transfer, as I could not find them anywhere on their site.        Well, the person I spoke to explained the rates to me, both inside and outside of the country.  So then I asked her if i could use a data cable during my off-peak free time or weekend free time to connect my cell phone to my laptop and dial my existing ISP to connect to the internet.        She told me that it used to be possible but it's not anymore because now T-Mobile requires you to have an internet package as part of your plan to connect to any ISP, and if you don't, the call will simply be disconnected.      Is this true?  And is this the case with all cell service providers?  Or is this just something they're saying so that I won't try to connect to MSN with my cell phone at night when I have free minutes?  Thanks to anyone who can help.
