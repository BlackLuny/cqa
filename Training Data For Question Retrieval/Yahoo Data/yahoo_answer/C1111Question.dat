20090203114230AAHhStY	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Bleaching my upper lip?	I have terrible upper lip hair and have been using a hair removal cream to get rid of it, but I find that it grows back after, like, a week. I have black hair and lightish-tannish skin, so would bleaching it work? It's pretty thick hair, so I was wondering if the hairs would show up more with the bleach because they were white. Waxing doesn't seem to work too well for me, and I can't think of any other way. What should I do? And how do I bleach my upper lip?

They don't change, they are in no way trendy. Every season it's the same clothes over and over again, don't tell me they didn't have it in turquoise last season because it doesn't matter it's the same cut and fabric every time. These clothes are so plain and you can get them for way cheaper elsewhere it's just a different brand.   It seems to me that the only appeal is the brand name on the clothing.. But you can get way better looking clothes from an equally widely respected brand name at that same price and it would be a much better deal.   These seriously look like clothes to jog in... I want to understand why you think it's so appealing??

When can I start to wash my hair?   I thought it would be okay to wash immediately since what they did was;   1. Comb cream through my hair.   2 Cover it in glad wrap.   3. Put this big blow-dryer thing over my head. (STINKY!!)   4. Rinse it out.   5. Blow dry.   6. Flat iron.   7. Put foam into my hair.   8. Rinse it out.   9. Flat iron.   10. Style.      As you can see they washed it out and styled it, so I thought maybe I could wash it straight away. My mom says I should wash it tomorrow morning, but I've been reading things online saying you should wait over 70 hours.. I'm so confused, I REALLY do not want to screw this up.

As long as you wear their clothes in your own way and own sense of style, you do not come out looking like a "clone." I think that if you aren't JUST wearing the logo tees all the time, it's fine. Personally, I love Hollister, and it isn't just because I'm trying to impress anyone just because those clothes are from a brand-name store. I think the clothes are comfortable and cute, and they fit me well with the body type I have. I think that if two people both went into Hollister, they could come out looking completely different from the other one.  What do you all think?

I use a shower wash daily,but know that we are always being told how good it is to use a scrub etc on face and body,on my body i have used exfoliating washes which i think are ok for one or two times a week,but people say there not that good cause its a product trying to do two things in one,whereas if you use a proper scrub i assume you would use your usual wash first? and then use the scrub after either by applying it on something or using the hands,possibly a brush to help get it on the back?   And would it be good to do this a couple of times a week,i find that you get these scrubs that are really thick and heavy,or gel like or foaming,not sure whats best.   Also there's been alot on tely about dry body brushing,well i had a brush with handle that i bought a while back from marks and spencer,i've already used it a few times with products and wet,and think its left a like film of stuff on it even though i washed it well after each use. i now read that that brush was for dry body brushing preferably,so maybe it should never get wet,also after dry body brushing with it my skin felt horrible i have to say.   Also does anyone know of any good body masks or if this is something you should do,otherwise i assume for this sort of thing you would go to a salon or health farm to have this done.   Hope i haven't rambled too much and confused people but i juts want some tips on exfoliation of the body mainly. Thanks.

20090221022307AAlkOpW	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Anyone know about corset training or tight lacing?	Im interested in starting to corset train just to get a more hour-glass figure, now im pretty short like 5'3 and my boobs are a DD but my ribs are pretty large so it spreads them out, this has always been a concern of mine. Will tight lacing move my ribs also?      What corset should i be looking for? Under-bust or over? I will be wearing it most of the time so my tight lacing process speeds up, so i need one that can be easily hidden under clothes (simple fabric) AND should i be looking for one that laces up front instead? I dont have anyone to help me out doing them up, and i think that may be easier.      And how long does it usually take if i only want a few inches off the middle. And will these results last? How long do i have to wear the corset and if i take it off will my shape return?      And lastly anyone know where i can buy a reasonably priced one?      Any other advice is welcome! :)

20090221034643AAVe6lS	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	My special bracelet broke and I need help getting a new one?	Hi,   Well the thing is my very favourite bracelet broke 3 times and my mum said the materials I was using to fix it wouldn't work and would break.   Now I went to argos and got an absolutely beautiful one but the thing is it leaves marks on my skin like it even shows the little details even like the eye marks on the little figures and it makes my skin also go all red and sticky. The other thing is that I never want to take it off to carry on my little tradition and when I first got it, in the box it said: PLEASE NOTE: this item is unsuitable to wear during sleep due to the risk of skin piercing.   So I might get a new one, but would you say I should get a real silver one for more money or the exact same one but coloured silver? Or would the paint chip? As I never take it off I have to make a good decision.   Thanks
20090221030350AApoS9a	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What bag should I get?	I'm new to this designer brand world so bear with me. I thought of Coach even though they don't have particularly nice designs. I'm more into elegant and practicality, like Prada and Chanel. If there are cheaper brands but just as good looking let me know! I'm thinking of getting a shoulder bag, preferably with adjustable straps if possible or even better, bags that have long straps where you can sling to one side, but if not then longer straps are fine. It also needs a few (but not too many) small pockets for phone, mp3 etc, and have enough space to carry 3-4 A4 sized books. I want one that can be used for almost anything (uni, outing, etc). It also has to last for at least 1-2 years since I know they'll cost me at least $60! What do you recommend? Or do you have another brand in mind? Please include pics and model number if possible so I can check it out when I go to the department store, thanks!

20090221035315AALXYEO	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can anyone help with an earring problem?	I got them pierced 7 years ago for my 6th birthday, and I seriously doubt I'd been more than a day without earrings until a few weeks ago.      I had to have an operation, followed by a week in the "high dependency unit", followed by 2 weeks hospitalised "bed rest".  Since you have to remove earrings for an operation, I just left them at home.      Anyway, 3 weeks later and I can't get one of my earrings to go back in.  I've tried the skinniest post i have, and I've even tried putting it through the back of the hole, but it just stops half way and won't go any further.      I can't decide whether to just force it back through, or whether to get the hole re-pierced.

20090221055614AAf8oUh	Beauty & Style;Hair	Using ManicPanic Hot Hot Pink on my hair? [pictures]?	I've had the bottom of my hair dyed a bright red, but I had to bleach it first, when I bleached it, it came out sort or yellow/orange then I would put in the dye and it would come out just like I wanted it.   The way it looked before:    http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...    I couldn't find a better picture, but it was a bright red, then when it faded, it looked pinkish..    http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...     I dyed it copper because it was already going back to the original orange.. Looks like this now.    http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...     http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...       I don't want to bleach it again, because it's really damaging, but the past 2 times I've dyed it red, I haven't redone the whole bleaching process and it always came out the way I wanted but I've never used ManicPanic, usually I used this cheap one from CVS or Walgreens.     http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/images/fs/larg...    That color or the red always comes out bright red, and I guess it was the bleach but its what I wanted so I always bought it.      Before I actually apply the manic panic, I wanted to know if anyone had experience with their hair being the color mine is [the orange copper type color] and what the results were...   I also bought this other one at Sally's and it was pink, and it didn't come out at all, but it was watery so maybe that had something to do with it.   But yeah, any advice would be appreciated.         note: I'm not up for stripping my hair, or bleaching it again.
20090221055708AAHA8by	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How should I take care of my facial skin?	I'm a 15 year old male.   I get spots on my forehead due to having a fringe, but I push my hair back whenever I can to reduce grease build up.   I wash my face twice daily with "Tea Tree Facial Wash" and warm water.      My skin tone on my face is far paler than the rest of my body and it often gets dry and blotchy in cold or hot temperatures.  I also have dark circles around my eyes (although I normally get 8 hours sleep or more), I believe it's due to my varying sleep patterns.  I get stressed very easily especially with work, which may be a cause too?      I think I have very sensitive skin, and I do what I can for it, but with the Tea Tree option I stupidly chose the one that was not for sensitive skin (should I stop using this right away?).      I have the diet of a normal teenager, pretty much balanced with the exception of a few more unhealthy foods, but I try to avoid these whenever possible.      I think my weight is average, and I'm probably closer to underweight than over for my height and age.      Any advice for what cleaning products I should use, what to avoid, what I should be eating and drinking, and how my lifestyle is affecting it?  Also, what can I use for the blotchiness and dark circles?  I'm not an expert on all the facial products and I often get caught up in the huge amount there are available and what they're all actually for.      Any advice is appreciated.  (:   Thanks!

I hadn't really paid any attention until this morning, when I found like 7 grey hairs!      I'm feeling pretty upset about this. I don't dye my hair and I haven't in years - my hair is considered "virgin" hair because I cut it all off and then grew it back out. I guess it might be time to start dying it again if I am already going grey at 21!!!      So, if any of you found grey hair at my age - how long did it take for all of your hair to be grey?
