AA11271437	I got to visit Honolulu, Hawaii on 3 separate occasions while I was in the U.S. Military (Naval Aviation).

2vzj65Kfaa	Hypno is correct.    To expand a little and give some more info ...    A melody is supported by the harmony (chords) - when you extract chords from a melody, you don't use every tone - and there are choices.    Often, you use the main notes that are emphasized and/or fall on the down beats.  That means that there are often non-chord tones moving through the melody.    While there are no hard and fast answers this will give you a basis to start with.  Apart from passing tone, there are also  suspensions, escape tones,  notes that suggest secondary dominant and other more removed harmonies, and a whole host of exceptions to any rule.    A good music theory course at your local community college can do wonders to help sort this out.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	It is true that most western music is based on the I-IV-V progression.    In this progression, the I is the tonal center.  The IV is the sub-dominant  The V is the dominant.    All music needs to resolve in some fashion and the V-I resolution is the most powerful resolution there is.  In fact, it's so powerful, it's referred to as a "Perfect Cadence". Progressions and how they resolve are also referred to as "Cadences".      In order to understand Chord Theory, you need to understand how different chords resolve to one another.  I've explained a Perfect Cadence.      There are also "Plagal Cadences".  This is when the resolution comes in the form of IV-I.  Since this is just shy of the V-I, it's considered an open or rolling cadence.  You wouldn't use this to end a song.  You generally find these in the middle of a song because it helps the song keep going.    There are also "Imperfect Cadences" which are any of the minor chords resolving to anything but the tonal chord (V-ii).  These are very unstable sounding.    In order to get a good grasp on this, I'd recommend picking up some books on "voice leading".  There are rules (which can be broken) which state which chords should lead to other chords.  I can't find a good resource on line, but I'm reading "The complete idiot's guide to composition" and it has a really good section on this.  I'd recommend picking that book up if you have a good working knowledge of theory.    In the end... the I-IV-V is what most western music is based on because it's the most perfect cadence.  Chords tend to lead to other chords, and by following these rules, you can create more chord progressions.

uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Limewire|`|FgUjZUhaaa	jam glue it has every think on it that's what  i use|`|O0mHKSABaa	www.beemp3.com|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com

VxozKUcCaa	If your best friend is the opposite sex and you two already get along, go for it because the foundations for a healthy relationship are already there (good communication, common interests, etc.)  People like to life in a fantasy world where they want to swept off their feet by a handsome stranger and taken away to a shining castle where they are independently wealthy and have servants that wait upon them hand and foot but, this is not reality.  These arbitrary "princess" fantasies block the basic communication needed at the start and set the relationship to fail in the long run.  The "friend" is obviously mature enough to realize the real gravity of your relationship together and has come to realize that the two of you are truly the best it is going to get.  If you are truly that "shocked" then the problem is with you and you are in fact not mature enough for a real relationship with anyone.  You should not take him up on his offer because you actually have not grown up to the level where he is and you are going to break his heart.  I hope you grow up soon however as he will not wait forever and he actually should not because there are thousands of others out there who have reached that level of maturity and do live in the real world and wasting his time with you would not be good for him.|`|88uIjItaaa	If it was a Girl Bestfriend.. tell her how I feel about it.

AA11137908	Don't you think about stuff before you do it? I would hope so|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	Aquarians analyze almost everything so I think that's what people mean when they say they think a lot.|`|UTKYOWdaaa	it means that aquarians like to daydream, and ponder things. It means that an aqaurius could spend a whole day, looking at a wall, not even thinking about the wal, you know?|`|yZrVMIs1aa	Who is "they"?  Cleo or the trailer park hooker you pay to give you life advice?|`|nstyHYliaa	Aquarius is highly tuned in with intellect on a universal level, being the third and final air sign, and second to last sign of the zodiac. This is why some say that Aquarians "come from a different planet" or are "mad scientist inventors". Their highly scientific brains are manifested from an understanding of the intellectual viewpoint of the world, and universe around them. A particular Aquarian behavioral quirk is a tendency to completely zone out for a short while. This is joked by some to be when "their home planet is calling". These are all merely satirical references to their pondering of the world around them. When you say an Aquarius thinks a lot, you are referring to their tendency to analyze abstract ideas and concepts, or their tendency to invent completely new ideas and concepts of their own.     Keep in mind however, that the main thinkers of the zodiac are the Gemini and Virgo (Gemini's keyword being "I Think"), so Aquarian thinking, though highly active is still pretty tame. Depending on the placement of the Aquarius's planets, if say Mercury is in Pisces, then they may be highly imaginative and skilled at traveling to foreign places in their mind. If the Aquarius does suddenly pack up and head off on a mental vacation, this again gives others the impression of thinking or daydreaming.

She called her friend for advice, and her friend asked her how many miles she had on her car.   "235,000 miles." Her friend told her that was the problem.  But the blonde's friend told her that her brother is a mechanic and could put back the miles to whatever she wanted. So the blonde went to the mechanic and told him to put the miles at 40,000. Two days later the blond's friend asked her if she sold the car since her brother dropped the miles.  The blonde told her, "Why would I sell the car? There are only 40,000 miles on it!"

MiDYJ8tMaa	According to a couple of on line sites, the words are:    Servatis a periculum... Servatis a maleficum...    But those don't mean 'Save us from danger, save us from evil'. In fact, they're pretty poor Latin.     Servatis = you are saving  a = from    Problem is that the words following 'a' don't work in Latin. They are in the wrong case - word ending is not right.     Servatis a periculo...Servatis a maleficio = You are saving (me/us) from danger...You are saving (me/us) from evil.|`|1Fz6GVsMaa	In Latin : Servatis a periculum... Servatis a maleficum...

The thing about 24 is the plot is always in trilogies.  If you've seen the whole series, you'll pick up on that.  Seasons 1-3 are all indirectly centered around catching Nina,  & Jack dealing with Teri's death.  Seasons 4-6 are about Cheng, & Jack dealing with the Chinese  government.  So if they don't have a season 9, there would be an uncompleted  plot line. See what I'm saying?  But I know that after the series ends, they are going to  make another movie.  By the way Jack is NOT going to die this season.  I noticed some one post that & it's ridiculous.  Hope I could help.|`|7L0PFTXKaa	No--not yet.  I heard somewhere that season 8 is likely to be the last season of 24.  I heard another rumor that Jack is going to die this season, and in the 8th season, Renee Walker will take over his job.      As of now, it's all just heresy.    I mean, there are only so many plots you can think up.|`|g8NiwNKEaa	God I hope so!, My husband & I watched the first season & we liked it, but that was it for us. That is just my honest opinion, i'm entitled to that. We are huge fans of Fringe, House, CSI's, & so many others that are just way better that 24, & as far as Jack goes, heck look at Clint Eastwood, he is way older & still is being "HEROIC"!!!!|`|aV66hiDOaa	Keifer has a contract through season 8.  After that, who knows.  I'm hoping for a couple more years, as long as they can keep coming up with good storylines!|`|eoE4gDpSaa	I have been here since the beginning but I'm fine if this is the last season although Fringe would be my last show. People that have deserted us tell me that the storylines are too repetitive and it is true. I still enjoy it but I was hoping for it to be a little different this season but it wasn't. Someone high up in the President's cabinet is dirty again. We needed something original this time- although I am enjoying they need something different if they are going to have another season.  My only other problem with 24 is that Jack has NEVER ever gotten shot with takes away from the realism of the show. He has killed a number of people (I actually came across a website where someone kept track of this- SAD) but has not gotten shot one time. He's been injured before of course but not shot. He can stick his head of out against trained soldiers and always dodge them- at least have him get shot one time this season

Lunch Bag.  Purse.  Coat/Hoodie.  I would also like to put some pictures on the door on the inside.  And sometimes another bag.  And that's mainly all.    What I don't want the school to know about or really I don't care as long as they don't take it off me, but stuff like pop cuz they might throw it away and I need a drink I sometimes get thristy during the day LOL.  Also cell phone and iPOd and sometimes hoodie, but they don't care if it's in ur locker.    That's pretty much all.    P.S.: They shouldn't always go tho your lockers nosing in your stuff, I know they do that probably for safety, but if I was a person that cared I might say cuz maybe they have a noted that they don't want people seeing or a piece of paper that says that they have something wrong or etc. that's privite and if the person searching isn't trusted even or even if they just decided to make you think they are when they really ain't, they could take your stuff/money and etc..  I would put this at the bottom, but there's kinda alot there so I just jotted it here.    This is kinda off topic and idk if it's gonna help you and yes I did go on alot, but here ya go.    To add:  I know they do them locker searches cuz they wanna see if the people have anything not aloud, but I say it's in there locker or something it's ok and as long as they don't take it out who cares and I can understand if a person gets in trouble if they have a gun or knife cuz that can hurt/kill someone and even if it is in there locker it shouldn't be there cuz someone might try and doing something bad with it but drugs, it's their's, it can harm no one unless u burn someone with a smoke or with a lighter or something and as long as their not smoking it or using it in school, it shouldn't really matter. Although they could be selling and that might be different, but still it ain't as bad as a weapon.    And who cares if u have pop (some schools don't allow it)  you should be aloud to drink what u wanna drink, well unless it's achole that's different, but other then that it should be ok, their parents probably mainly gave it to them anyways and I know they care about our health, but 180 days each school year, not even a whole day of no pop really isn't gonna do nothing u can still drink it at home or on the bus or something and it really shouldn't matter is it's diet.        Hope I helped you some.  P4n. (peace 4 now.).  Bye byezz.  =).

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I've been thinking of Judy Garland for weeks now. I just finished watching the movie "Me and My Shadows", which is excellent. It was a book written by Judy's daughter, Lorna Luft. It showed Judy's upbringing and how she was raised in a family of performers. Even as a baby Judy stood out and her parents (particularly her stage mother) put her on the track to be a movie star. MGM and Louis B. Mayer constantly put down Judy and forced her to go on pills to control her weight. Judy never stood a chance because she was addicted to pills so early; they were practically shoved down her throat by the studio heads. Also, Judy's father was a closeted gay man who died suddenly when Judy was a young girl. Judy's mother cared mostly about the money and the fame. She didn't see that her poor daughter was so conflicted and lonely. Judy also had several nervous breakdowns due to a broken heart, the pressures of the studio heads and her insecurity about her weight, looks, etc. Judy ended up marrying Vincent Minelli (father of Liza), but he turned out to be gay and not really interested in her. Judy's most successful marriage was to Sid Luft, father of her children Lorna and Joey, but that marriage crumpled under financial pressures. In a nutshell, Judy was fabulously talented, but a very sick woman. She was addicted to pills so young that she never managed to get away from her addiction. In the end she overdosed on pills while living in London and after marrying a much younger man. Watch "Me and My Shadows"....it's amazing.|`|bf2cd964199f11f15c79eba3f76b6f16aa	I'm a huge fan, too...  It's all true (the drugs and such)...  "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" is a cut that I always request at Pat O'Brien's Piano Bar (New Orleans and Orlando)...  Check-out some of the biographical work done about her life.  Maybe it'll be on Biography some time soon.  Also, there was a movie done not too long ago (a made for tv movie I believe- Charleze Theron might be in it, too)...|`|waDKbT61aa	With the demise of her television series, Garland returned to the stage. Most notably, she performed at the London Palladium with her then 18-year-old daughter Liza Minnelli in November 1964. The concert, which was also filmed for British television network ITV, was one of Garland's final appearances at the venue. She made guest appearances on the The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, The Hollywood Palace and The Merv Griffin Show, an episode of which she guest-hosted.[78]    Garland sued Sid Luft for divorce in 1963, claiming "cruelty" as the grounds. She also asserted that Luft had repeatedly struck her while he was drinking and that he had attempted to take their children from her by force.[79] She had filed for divorce more than once previously, including as early as 1956.[80]    A 1964 tour of Australia was largely disastrous. Garland's first concert in Sydney, held in Sydney Stadium because no concert hall could accommodate the crowds who wanted to see her, went well and received positive reviews. Her second performance, in Melbourne, started an hour late. The crowd of 70,000, angered by her tardinessand believing her to be drunkbooed and heckled Garland. The performer fled the stage after just 45 minutes.[81] She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as "brutish".[54] A second concert in Sydney was uneventful but the Melbourne appearance garnered her significant bad press.[82] Some of that bad press was deflected by the announcement of a near fatal episode of pleurisy, followed by Garland's fourth marriage to tour promoter Mark Herron. They announced that their marriage had taken place aboard a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong, however, Garland was not legally divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.[83] Her divorce from Luft became final on May 19, 1965,[79] but Herron and Garland did not legally marry until November 14.[84]    In February 1967, Garland was cast as "Helen Lawson" in Valley of the Dolls for 20th Century Fox. The character of "Neely O'Hara" in the book by Jacqueline Susann was rumored to have been based on Garland. The role of O'Hara in the film was played by Patty Duke. During the filming, Garland missed rehearsals and was fired in April. She was replaced by Susan Hayward.[85]    Returning to the stage, Garland made her last appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July, a 16-show tour, performing with her children Lorna and Joey Luft. Garland wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in Valley of the Dolls.[86]  Judy Garland's crypt at The Ferncliff Mausoleum    By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated. She performed in London at the Talk of the Town nightclub for a five-week run[87] and made her last concert appearance in Copenhagen during March 1969.[88] She married her final husband, Mickey Deans, in London on March 17, 1969,[89] her divorce from Herron having been finalized on February 11 of that year.[90]    On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead by Deans in the bathroom of their rented Chelsea, London house. The coroner, Gavin Thursdon, stated at the inquest that the cause of death was "an incautious self-overdosage" of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of ten 1.5-grain (97 mg) Seconal capsules.[91] Thursdon stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that there was no evidence to suggest she had committed suicide. Garland's autopsy showed that there was no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue in her stomach, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in one dose. Her death certificate stated that her death had been "accidental".[92] Garland had turned forty-seven just twelve days prior to her death. Her Wizard of Oz co-star Ray Bolger commented at Garland's funeral, "She just plain wore out." An estimated 20,000 people lined up for hours at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home to view her body.[93] Garland was interred in Ferncliff Cemetery, in Hartsdale, New York.|`|urmhRHwxaa	Yes...Garland suffered from low self-esteem, depression, and drug addiction for most of her life.  When she was still a young teenager, she was given bennies by MGM staff in order to keep her energy high for shooting films and she soon became addicted.  By her early 20s, she was hospitalized for her addiction.    Garland believed she was very unattractive because she was short and somewhat on the chubby side compared to more glamorous young starlets like Deanna Durbin and Lana Turner.  This was exacerbated by MGM: while Lana Turner's image was as a sexy heartbreaker, Garland was seen more as a wholesome, almost wallflower sort of girl.  Even worse, studio head L.B. Mayer gave her the nickname "my little hunchback".    In addition to drug addiction, Garland also had bouts of self-injury...at one point, she was hospitalized after banging her head against her bathtub until it bled.  She also attempted suicide with pills.      There is a lot more to tell, but I don't want this post to get too long.  I would recommend Gerald Clarke's "Get Happy" for an entertaining biography of Garland.  I admit that I think she was incredibly beautiful and talented and it's a shame the way she suffered.|`|AA11111862	Throughout her life Judy Garland used pills to stay thin, give her energy, and help her sleep. This addiction started at an early age due to the pressure of her mother Ethel to be thin and full of energy. On June 21, 1969 Judy took her normal dose of sleeping pills before going to bed. Upon waking up in the middle of the night, she took another dose because she thought that the original dose had worn off. This mistake would cost Judy Garland her life, for she never awoke after taking that second dose of pills. On June 22, 1969 Judy Garland was found dead.|`|vhirRGEAaa	they put her on drugs at a young age like 15.    It was to help her loose weight and also added pills to keep her energy up so she ended up getting additcted to them.|`|FXPP4KrZaa	I have been a fan of Judy Garland since I was nine years old. I too got interested in Judy Garland from first watching The Wizard of Oz.     Judy Garland never thought of herself as tragic, and she would always find the humor in everything, I am not denying that she didn't have a tragic life, but she always knew how to laugh at herself and move on.    Her mother Ethel Gumm was a Broadway/Movie star wannabe. (A lot like Mama rose in the musical Gypsy) Since Ethel Gumm never managed to become a star, she relied on her three daughters for her last chance to be involved with the show business industry.  Having them do tour throughout America, The Gumm Sisters were one of the many groups trying to be successful in Vaudeville.    While doing to the point of 8 shows a day, these kids didn't have enough energy on their own. Ethel had given Judy and her sister speed, so they would have more energy while performing. Both Judy and her sisters remained addicted to the pills for the rest of their lives...Judy may have attempted suicide, but one of her sisters (I Can't remember which one) actually did commit suicide and died. Judy's other sister died in 1974 of drug addiction. And of course Judy unfortunately died in 1969.    Judy in 1959 came down with a life threatening case of Hepatitis. She also came up the weight of 200 pounds. (And remember she was only five feet tall) After encountering this disease, the doctors told her she would never work again. But they were wrong, in 1961 Judy made a comeback performance at New York's Carnegie Hall. When the live concert was released on record on July 10, 1961 it stayed on the top 100 charts for 74 weeks, 13 as number one.    Of course Judy's Mother wasn't the only one who got her continued to be hooked on speed. When Judy was signed at MGM from the years 1935 to 1950, they enforced her to be on three pills. One type of pill would make her lose weight. But at the same time they would make her sleepy, so then they would give her speed to keep her awake. Then for a "restful" night sleep she would take sleeping pills. Which often they didn't keep her awake then entire night, so she would wake up and the middle of the night to take more pills, forgetting how many she had taken earlier when she first went to bed.    By the late 60s her drug use was way worse than it was in the 30s. She was taking four speed pills, every four hours. And if she missed one dose she would possibly have a seizure, or go into a coma.     When Judy Garland died on June 22, 1969, many people thought it was a suicide attempt. But it was proven that she did not commit suicide. She had died during the night because her heart gave out because of all the medication. But the doctors discovered that she took her normal amount of pills when she had gotten up in the middle of night; If she had committed suicide, she would have taken an extra amount of pills.    I tried to summarize Judy's drug addictions issues as best as I could..I could go on FORVER about Judy...shes like the love of my life. If you have ANY other questions about Judy, please email me. Just go under my Yahoo Answers profile and click the email me link.    I would defiantly recommend watching The Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows movie. It was based on the biography book written by her daughter Lorna. Also, I would recommend joining the Judy Garland Experience group. We are constantly talking about Judy, (Hence the groups name) So come down and join, and expand your Judy knowledge.    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thejudygar...|`|FDt7cC8haa	She was on drugs....that caused her demise....

PBuYKm8Aaa	They were a [GOOD] Punk band from New York. They were huge in the 70's and totally shaped punk music that we have today.

oMDB0oipaa	idk. i think glam rock was gross. the 90's had some better rocker style with pantera and metalica. they didnt really put much into style though they wore casual clothing for the adverage head banger(ripped jeans and a band-t shirt) Kiss had an orginal look.    But your right all the bands now do skinny legs and make-up.|`|Ght1Ik7Iaa	Everyone got fat|`|2sm2RfBaaa	It faded away, but a good New band with enough Influence could bring it back|`|cVqCryr6aa	Children and record execs ruined it.|`|VFc9leFmaa	everything changes...so does Rock N Roll   you wouldn't want to still walk around in 60ies or 80ies clothing all the time either I think? =)|`|DibFrwxlaa	It's just the current fashion.    You may (or may not) remember when 80s mainstream "metal" consisted of 4-5 guys per band all wearing heavy makeup and massive hair:  http://usuarios.lycos.es/hardrockbuenosa...  http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music/m...  http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h75/qw...    Seriously.  These were popular bands.|`|VaKhLMqxaa	Styles change.  Same reason why most people don't dress  like they did in the 70's, 80's, etc.  Times change and so do styles.  Ultimately, most people are still in it  for the money and the fame,  but there are still some out there that get into the  business because they love music and performing.  I think if "rock stars" still dressed like they did some years  back (ex: hair metal), it wouldn't be too appealing to people  of this generation.   That's just my opinion. lol|`|mYeq5AvFaa	well u should start listening to jrock

(As an analogy, consider a table as being darkness, a tablecloth as being light: when you pull the tablecloth off, the table itself (darkness) doesn't move).    Theory 2: Darkness moves at the same speed as light, and it meets the laws of motion in that Darkness is the equal and opposite reaction for the action of the movement of light.    Theory 3: A man stands at the doorway of his bedroom, attired in boxer shorts and a sleeveless undershirt. One hundred times in a row, he turns off the light switch and dashes for the bed. How many times does he see himself land under the covers? Zero. There isn't any light there. Obviously dark got there quicker than light. Ergo:   Let " d" equal the speed of dark  d = SQRT( e/m ) + 1  1 what? Hey, I provided the equation. You do the dimensional analysis.    Theory 4: Light moves. Darkness is the absence of light and does not."

The story is told from the first person viewpoint of an autistic process analyst. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2003, and was also an Arthur C. Clarke Award finalist."  Source and further information:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speed_o...     3) "Recent work by researchers working for Lausten Transit established that the light and dark were in a continual battle for supremacy. It was established that dark was nocturnal and it was postulated by Lausten Transit that the speed of dark was variable. Considering the viscosity of dark as described by Lausten Transit it may be shown that dark must in fact have a constant speed, using quantum electrodynamics, QED. Here, researchers from The Mill (YSA's new research labs) present the theoretical basis for these conclusions as well as a practical method for calculating the speed of dark are demonstrated."

4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	X - factor audition.    :)|`|FDt7cC8haa	If there was a known way to do it....we would all be singers....|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	Try out for American Idol...Good luck!|`|obfK5mSQaa	You tube  myspace  american idol  ...stuff like that    or you have to know somebody in the business or who knows somebody IN the business.|`|441GSyaMaa	It takes so long to get where you probably want to be, imagine how many people there are like you who want to make it? There are no shortcuts, just an uphill struggle (until you get to the top, then it gets better :-P ).     I've been in a band since i left school (now for 4 years, that's properly too) and we have done okay... but it just takes so long to even get noticed|`|47785d3bcadb0903614d430f27228819aa	Go on American Idol and hope you don't suck.  See if there are any auditions in your area and go to them.  Get a Myspace and post your singing/songs that you wrote on there to gain friends/fans.|`|OQdPzl15aa	First of all, it depends on two things:    1) Do you have a voice that is good, or do you have one that really is unique from the rest?    2)Are you marketable?  Do you have the personality and style that singers need in order to be successeful?    There are a few things you can do, like get an agent or talk to local joints/bars/clubss etc.. and see if you can sing there and you can even apply to work at those restaurants with the singing waiters/waitresses.    But, please be realistic.  Don't pursue this with the school of thought that "you can be anything if you just believe".  You are likely to be let down, if you don't realize your limitations, then you are wasting your time and possibly a bright future in another industry. Consider that you will always have singing, and if you love it and are good at it, keep it as a hobby instead of devoting your entire life to it.    But again, like I said, it really depends on the first two aspects I mentioned.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	AMERICAN IDOL lol|`|XoYHF1RLaa	Try Youtube. Lots of publicity there :]|`|xTpvnWRuaa	Unfortunately it comes down to connections, money, who you know, and all of that insider stuff. If not, then auditions, school plays,and small stuff to get "Discovered."|`|zFvmW0EAaa	a kit kat bar|`|3ozaCLYqaa	I would suggest getting into a decent performing arts college.  Chances are, one of your professors will know someone significant and you may get a chance that way.    Also, if there are any community theaters near by, you may want to look into participating in something like that.      And you never know who will be at a karaoke session - so go have fun with that too.|`|mYeq5AvFaa	get into a band...its to late for American idol|`|MuflptJVaa	You need to get ur music to a firm.If they like it then you might get famous.The other thing is that u might take 5yrs getting there.Remember that there are more singers who don't get there.Also,You can't be 50.they want younge ppl who have no idea what dey r doing.If u make 1,000 the bosses make 1.000.000 pounds.  If you get there well done:)|`|yCjTBYAEaa	American Idol|`|e5bbc21bd805396768103a1ebd9ea78eaa	Send your tape to someone important.|`|kB7Mk5Eyaa	American Idol|`|X5afTqKiaa	Just audiotn for american idol|`|tiTAYiLZaa	sing very loud on the street :)|`|3untsNTlaa	American Idol.

65oZwNk6aa	Nursery rhymes - Jack and Jill is about alcoholics domestic violencing each other, Oranges and Lemons is about getting executed over non payment of debts, The grand Old Duke of York is about an incompetent general whose procastination and side-switching led to the deaths of several thousand of his countrymen... and don't get me started on the mutilation of blind mice...|`|GLTAtHtoaa	Whatever kind of music it is parents should be aware of what their kids are listening to and looking up the lyrics.  There are all different kinds of people making all different kinds of music.|`|oHnu7ieQaa	It could be music and more and likely be rap or any kind that has swear words or talking about guns and other weapons in it. To be honest its the parents that are a bad influence because lots of these CDs have parental idvisory or 18+ on them so shoulnt be letting there kids listen to it anyway.|`|LDLTjNCraa	MCs 100%.

They have swear words and it could also be that the lyrics are 18+    =]|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	rap, its full of swear words and slang and abusive language|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Without proper parenting anything can be a potential bad influence on kids. Saturday morning cartoons could illicit violent tendencies in kids. Tom beats the piss out of Jerry. Guess little Timmy can do the same to little sis Jenna based on that rationale.     Time to stop passing the blame and the responsibility. Being a parent is not a God-given right but a privilege. One with a set of hugely important responsibilities. Parents need to get involved and monitor what their children watch, listen to and what games they play.     After all, one of the biggest influences on a child's life is his or her parents.|`|AA11558287	Rap and heavy metal

17100981ca59977dbefa374ecd987125aa	no don't think so.. I know one and he looks like a ghost|`|dmxnblomaa	I think what makes them attractive is the different personalities that they have. Each of those celebrities, have a very interesting personality about them. They all have a wild side. That's what make them beautiful, and also they have other planets, that make them beautiful. There something beautiful about all Geminis in there own way. Just think about it, it's not just your face and body that make you beautiful it's really what's on the inside. I know plenty of very nice looking people, but the way they act, makes them so ugly. And you wouldn't want to be no where near them.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Madonna's a Leo and Will is a Libra.    But yeah.

MHhFMdWoaa	Depends on how crafty you are. I have made "armor" out of craft foam, metallic paint (for the metal-y look) & resin. It looked really nice when I was done, but there was a lot of trial-and-error before I got it right.|`|A0N9D6yZaa	Sure you can make it but it isn't easy. Depending upon the armor you're looking for, it would probably be cheaper (and look better unless you've done it before or are EXTREMELY artistic) to just buy one.

You may have more ability than your sister's friend. Also, you do not know at this time if you are being accepted to this school.

We're already screwed enough.    Are you telling me that people are soooo lazy that they can't even spell right?|`|QxJlZSBwaa	Because spelling is important. If a person can't spell or is too lazy to spell check I don't even pay attention to their answer. Using the "texting" abbreviations is particularly annoying and lazy.    Misspelling words just makes the person look dumb/lazy. Why would anyone want to portray themselves in this way?|`|eNGsEmdQaa	Cause I went to skewl...|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I'm not hung up on it. But I prefer if someone takes the time to spell correctly and use basic punctuation.

I guess that is why, I durn't knw, LOL;)|`|e4ekb1amaa	Because spelling things properly is how you get your point across... if you don't use proper grammar, and you can't spell worth a damn, you'll look like a moron. If you're arguing a different point of view than I am, and you can't properly form sentences or spell words, any argument you make is worthless.     The occasional type-o is one thing.... butchering words throughout an entire paragraph is quite another.     If you look and sound like a retard.... chances are.... you're probably in special classes.|`|ehMPOlefaa	Some pretty good answers already, and from those that are actually answering the question.  My own is that words have meaning.  Then you can go on to say that because of homonyms or homophones you can have words that actually sound alike but represent completely different things.  The sort of thing that can lead to confusion.  If you type "bare" and meant to type "bear", are you talking about someone being naked or a Panda or Grizzly?   So which is then supposed to be?  Spelling the word correctly lets anyone whose reading what you've written understand what you're trying to communicate.      Another idea is that you'd probably not want to actually speak the words you write if you've spelled them wrong.  For instance, if you were giving a speech and actually tried to pronounce the word "shuold" in a sentence because you misspelled "should" on the paper you wrote, you'd have a hard time doing it and then you'd likely be mocked for saying it out loud.|`|2q0CNeg0aa	idk but im not so i dont give a rats *** sss|`|nXxb89LIaa	They have nothing better to do, babe. :)|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	I understand there is a lot of people out in this world who can read , but no spell that well.     I can spell okay but not that well. If it is a word I don't use daily/weekly I tend to forget how it is spelled.    I know one thing if it wasn't for firfox and it's spell check I don't know what I would do.     I just hate it when I am typing at mock 12 and misspell a small word like to I am bad at pulling ot. Just is worse I type jsut.     So over all I don't make fun of anyone who can not spell and who do not punctuate their sentences due to sometime I misspell and forget to punctuate.    As long as I can get an idea of what they are saying it's good for me.|`|QuFnw8Ggaa	They should at least answer the question or comment on the subject matter of the question and they shouldnt make misspelling a big deal unless its really really constant but it seems like most of the time its a simple mistake yet they throw insults at you.Did you know that if you read right it doesnt matter in what order the letters in a word are for you to be able to read it as long as the first and last letter are in the right place because your brain does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole?|`|4myG3rbKaa	fo real|`|QIZH3RkXaa	It's Yahoo! not yahoo.|`|1gNcoz7Saa	i no i b lyk wat da flz peepz|`|PYmdmuw8aa	What does BJ stand for?|`|Faw2iBtfaa	I don't really care as long as it can be figured out|`|O94uVa80aa	Because a lot of people on here pretend to be smart by spelling since they're ******* retarded at life.|`|X3GCmjbraa	i hav kno frekin clew    stoopid if yu ax me|`|H08EH8F9aa	Their fooking TWATS    Ignore the posh fools|`|sOlGuPDhaa	i knowww right???? ppl gotta chilax!!!!!|`|VJREeIgNaa	they see a nice pair of jugs and it makes them turn into grammar police.    big t*ts = bad spelling..|`|diqCdxn5aa	Maybe 'cos it takes longer to read...|`|EkiF0DaNaa	Minor spelling doesn't get to me, but when you are trying to be helpful and    ppl tieyp leeik ths it gats kenda annoyang    knowhatimsayin?|`|hrcePD8Oaa	i dont ee wats the big deal about not spelling right|`|cd661173ba7e4c1fe6e15a51f9430757aa	Because they're @sshole, like that.|`|985by23Jaa	Because it's just annoying when people spell wrong.     And I HATE it when people use the wrong 'your/you're' grrrrr one of my pet hates.    It just shows people how lazy/dumb other people are.|`|ai33g11Maa	Because, it is sad to see the decline in standards of literacy amongst some YA users.  It's a shame that people can't be bothered to spell/punctuate properly.  People are wasting their education in a haze of "txt spk".    Young people so often degrade the English Language with abbreviations and such, and it really is frustrating to read.  Sometimes, it's actually impossible to read.  It also makes the writer out to sound like a complete retard, even though they may not be so.    That's why.|`|kFuCqQIWaa	I usually try to spell perfect but it takes more time so oh what the heck dont use commas or capital letters haha but i am no dummy i can make a page look good if im not in a rush|`|fCHlfGKPaa	i guess because they feel like when they are on here they are cool, but since when does it really matter if you can spell? back in my day the cool kids were the ones who didnt know how to tie their shoes|`|WgtZYJT7aa	For real, last week I asked a question and someone corrected me.

I can't help but laugh with the "you're/your" thing though...I mean like...    Person: your cute XD  Me: Aww thanks :D ( lol my cute... )|`|j1Vm96JXaa	I don't exactly favor the kind of... shortened, text message kind of words... like;  "Do u gt it? Cuz im lyk, izzit bs?"    I hate those. In text messages, that's fine, but seriously, in IMs and e-mails, and blog posts, that gets really annoying.    I don't mind misspellings, nobody's perfect, I used to spell finally as finnaly.     I do use "Internet slang", like LOL, WTF, FTW, LMAO, ROFL, OMG, stuff like that.    I am kinda... picky about the correct punctuation, though.|`|slMIQcWMaa	I totally agree, it seems some like to correct others, hmmm, wonder what that says about them, oh well who cares
VA3tGarQaa	yes, that's really romantic. make sure you buy pink and white balloons. and pink paper to write the message on|`|9o9UigBaaa	yes sounds like a good idea|`|ASSqyNDYaa	so i'm a creative person and it sound like you are too. i say this a good idea! i think its fun and people will love the mystery as well. however! you also want something that will get you the money and although this is cute,many people shy away from things like this and you probably won't get the expected amount of money for the fundraiser. you wana do something that fits everyones taste. if you are going to do this do some other things as well. maybe you could try selling baked goods or making creative valentine gifts to sell. you should also have a grand prize and have people buy a ticket for the drawing. yet make the prize unknown to others. hope al works out!|`|m1JyB08Raa	sounds like an excellent idea,how about adding a small piece of candy in the balloon also?|`|hZ9omSataa	the only thing I would change is that you should write anonymous instead of "anomynis"

Groceries are way up, along with everything else, and I think before too long, unless you have unlimited funds, we all will notice a difference.
ioNTTqKfaa	Naw...I listen to a lot of kill-a-hoe kill-a-hoe type music but I have the upmost respect for women.    I don't want to genre-label. There's a lot of hip hop artists who respect women in their music and there's a lot who don't. And a lot who are in between. Other music genres are like that too. And I can't really pick an individual artist to represent how I feel about women either. I don't know these cats personally. There are a lot of singers who sing about love and all that but then they get accused of being womanizers and beating on their girlfriends/wives. I can't really compare myself to someone I don't know, ya know?|`|zVdNQowNaa	DMX is my favorite rapper, and I'm a felon. I'm angry and I'm aggressive. I only treat women with respect if they treat me with respect and if they use manors to me I will do the same. I don't put up with no bullsh*t from females....I love women though...also DMX has a thing for dogs, so do I. I don't think any dogs should be banned.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Yes. I enjoy soothing music (R&B, Jazz, Soul, etc), and I like to treat my women that way. Not giving women enough attention is grounds for termination!    I'd go with John Coltrane (soothing sax), Al Green (making love) and Luther Vandross (cozy nights alone).|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	I like KRS-One and respect women.|`|bik6rJZkaa	I think it is.

This is kinda hard to answer. I like so much. I think since I love Jazz then yes. My lady is classy and styled and has timeless beauty. and I treat her that way.    She's built like Alicia Keys with that bubble azz and gorgeous hair so R&B, but I know Hip Hop is her first love.   So...I dunno if I answered this properly.|`|u8hsZ7claa	Yes/No/Maybe...depends on the women and other variables that include but aren't limited to planetary orbits, south pole glacier activity, the economy, my diet, eye color, the temperature of David Rutherford in mid July...

I'm Edgar Allen Poe meets Prince so I've heard|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	nope..    i listen to alot of Sean Price, and i dont choke b*tches and stomp em out with my timbs|`|bLr5Wbmraa	I treat women how my moms taught me, not music.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	No, cuz I like alot of different types of Hip Hop but I have more angry/hardcore hip hop than anything else and I am a very easy going person.    I would have to put my persona with maybe Natalie Stewart of Floetry.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-zhPINcP...|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Hi Cap    Well I listen to so many different genres of music it is hard for me to answer this.  But I guess in a way yeah!!!!  If I load up my ipod with some "raw/angry/violent music then I notice I am a little fast to say F you LOL than if I have it loaded with some easy listening or adult contemp.      Honestly my fav. rap artist is Jay-Z but my fav. musician of all time is Alanis Morissette And most try to put her into many different kinds of genres but I think she is a genre of her own.    My next tat that I am getting in 2 weeks will be some of her lyrics:    One day I will speak freely  I'll be less afraid  And measured outside of my poems and lyrics and art  One day I will be faith-filled  I'll be trusting and spacious authentic and grounded and home    I have been running so sweaty my whole life  Urgent for a finish line  And I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete    It is goning to look great on my back written on a scroll with vines and so forth going around it.  Still try to figure out the font!    Edit:@Mar I love Poe!!! I read him to my 5 yr old all the time!!!

Well there are many, but this is one;   http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=YzK_EVul6d...  Isn't that one of the most beautiful intros you've ever heard? Gah! I can't explain it, i just love this song! And so many other Metallica songs, they rule!! =D    EDIT: HA! I do know who Rata Blanca are, maybe you should try and accept that;   one, you're not the only person in the world who has heard of them  two, in my opinion Metallica are still far better  and three, its pathetic to thumbs down people just 'cause they have different opinions to you.

X9kNbpnQaa	I'd have to say Lelouch. If he had his Geass, it would be a hands down victory. Even if he didn't, though, Bonaparte lost in reality because Russia used nature against him. And several times in the Anime, Lelouch did the same thing (the Landslide, Mt. Fugi, Chinese royal burial grounds, bridges, bubbles sinking the navy, etc). He was not only an excellent general, but also had the know-how to use his surroundings to their greatest benefit. I bet he would have arranged a fate similar to Russia's Winter for Bonaparte.     I mean come on! Bonaparte fell for the same thing most of Lelouch's foes do, except this one took months to fully play out instead of moments.|`|SGBOUJ1Zaa	Napoleon Bonaparte|`|XCBXIBiHaa	Napoleon      it is irrelevant to compare an anime character with a real person.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	Napoleon|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Interesting. It depends on whether or not Lelouch has his Geass powers. Without Geass, Lelouch is just a pretty boy while Bonaparte is the man. But Artem the Pharaoh from Yugioh would beat both of them using his spiritual powers from his millenium puzzle. Remember the Pharaoh used that weird mind thing and Yelled "Oblivion" to damage Kaiba and Pegasus mind. Yugioh- "Gotta Collect em all." Ha haha!!!..... Lolz..... Also note that the greatest emperor is Genghis Khan of the Mongols, he would have slaughtered them all. As the most ruthless killer he destroyed all of Asia, and beat up most of Europe. I would not have wanted to be in that era.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghas_Kha...|`|FK0Lc696aa	Yeah, this is an interesting question.     With the geass, definitely Lelouch.   Without it... hhmm....I would have to say Bonaparte. I don't think Lelouch would be able to lead the people as well as Napoleon did, without his geass. And yes, Lelouch is really smart at strategics and all... but I just don't see him surpassing Bonaparte without his geass.     Bonaparte really was brilliant. It was his ego that got him in the end. A mistake that I'm sure Lelouch would probably make, too, though.     Honestly! Falling into such an easy trap? Well, it was rather smart... but still! He wiped out one of the most impressive armies in history just because he was too proud and sure of himself.     Well, we can all learn our lessons from history:   Don't visit Russia during the winter time.     Lol!    Wow... I just went completely off topic...    *whistles*|`|IDTQwgBaaa	Napoleon|`|nUOw6rOgaa	Lol.  Sweet question.    I'm going to have to go with Lelouch.  Mostly because i'm picking favorites.  Lol.

e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	It seems Tom cannot stand Jeff.  If you look at previous episodes it is so clear.  Tom has the final say so Jeff got the boot.    Normally I don't care too much about eliminations but when Ariane got eliminated instead of Leah 2 weeks ago and Radhika instead of "raw fish" Leah last week, I was upset.  It seems not saying good bye to your guests is a worse sin than serving raw, undercooked fish.    Then last night Jeff gets cut instead of Fabio (whom I adore).  Fabio served way overcooked venison and mouthed off to the guest judge, didn't matter, Tom wanted Jeff gone.  BTW - I agree w/Jeff, cervichi should be served cold.    This will be my last season of Top Chef.|`|27jdKozNaa	I liked jeff too but unfortuneatly he had a really hard time pulling all of his ideas together to make one solid dish  He had great ideas & he was a great chef but he just had so amny at one time & he couldn't contrl them & it was his demise    By the way am I the only one that thinks he look like Ricky Shroeder LOL???    Also I hope Fabio picks it up. I really thought he was going home last night..|`|csObEIeBaa	Don't know.|`|KLNLfYQeaa	He was eliminated because he was consistently among what the judges felt were the 'worst'.|`|BJoojnQCaa	He was sent home because he couldn't edit all his ideas down to make one solid dish. He was a good cook, but always tried to do too much in his dishes, which was his downfall. End the end what matters is how the food taste not how many techniques you used to prepare it.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	That's a good question! If you ask me, Fabio should have been gone a long time ago and last night his boyfriend Stefan should've went with him. I don't even care for anyone that's left except Carla.
S8onSHvoaa	No, he was not flirting.|`|rwqhx24jaa	i dont think you should be getting involved with this because its not very safe even though your pretending to be someone else...  but yes hes flirting because he wants you to know his details so you can get together with him and get to know each other better.

He was being friendly.  Not to get in your business, but you are playing a very dangerous game.  If you go searching for a problem, you will find one.  My advise is to stop now, and just respect and enjoy your relationship, before you lose a potentially good guy, because you are playing games. I wish you the best.|`|cgEg5jfYaa	HIII HAPPY 11TH BDAY!!!|`|3PBlpQFTaa	Doesn't that fall into the "stalking" category???  And in case it doesn't...are you proud of what you're doing?

That's sort of creepy actually, on your part, and on his because you're a stranger to him. What do you call flirting?    You should never test the ones you love, that means there are trust issues. You don't trust him, so you test him? terrible.

oyflZN2Jaa	Gotta say it seems to have gone from fun and entertaining ,to sad and repetitive.|`|xgsUp8IPaa	I think that Lost is getting better by the episode.  The 3 episodes aired so far in season 5 have been excellent.    And just for the record, the phrase "jump the shark" has jumped the shark.|`|AA12289981	The writers have a detailed plot outline, and they will surely get through all of the twists and resolve them.  I think it's great!  Maybe it's getting kinda out there, but overall it is fun to see what will happen next, and who is connected to whomever else.  Like a sci-fi soap opera!|`|66dd0f9079eca1ebc158246bb048c00faa	No, I would have thought that about two seasons ago, but now they're wrapping all the mysteries up.|`|AA12315431	Nope. It is getting better all the time. They are giving us more mysteries but answering old mysteries at the same time like now we know that Widmore was an 'other.'|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I love Lost, it keeps getting better.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, sometimes.  I am a new fan of LOST and just got addicted this past few months.    I think that LOST is confusing because of the flash forwards and flash backs.  And then you have the shifting time on the island, which adds more confusion.  Sometimes it's days after the show is aired that I "get" one of the clues as to what is going on in the series.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	No I think its finally found itself.....    It got real out there for a while but now its really coming together.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I think the writers kind of put themselves into a corner and now they are digging their way out. It's very confusing and at times boring. I still like it though. I'm just wondering how the writers are going to explain all the twists and turns.|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	I was a fan since episode one the first time it aired. I was like Obsessed with it. But i lost interest since season 3. It was getting too complicated to the point I couldn't remember who was who and what was what. I think it would have been a great show it had either ended on a strong note, maybe 3 seasons, or not gotten to carried away with all the island secrets.|`|sCUnadcnaa	It has already jumped the shark. It should have ended after last season because now it's just boring.

POXOqhOYaa	Hi Blanderswake! :)    I would suggest you try to distribute your comic first on your own to local neighbours and friends, maybe even acquaintances to raise some interest about your comic strip. Then if there seems to be quite a interest and people are asking about it ask your local news paper about putting it in they're paper, sometimes you need to collect different people's signatures as proof to the newspaper department though so that they'll add it in but I doubt that would be your case if there was avid interest. Then once it hits the new stands it will go off from there and you'll just have to wait and see where it takes you.    Personally, I'd enjoy a more unrealistic comic strip because when you sit down to read the paper in the morning you want to get a laugh with your morning coffee and have something to brighten you up...not be reading something serious like. See, a comic strip should be like a "escape from reality" in a sense.    Anyway I hope I helped you out and have a good day.|`|IDTQwgBaaa	The second scenario would be more interesting, and you could at first try in some local newspaper.

j7D3Sazraa	A gorgeous young redhead goes into the doctor's office and said that her body hurt wherever she touched it.   "Impossible!" says the doctor. "Show me."   The redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.   The doctor said, "You're not really a redhead, are you?   "Well, no" she said, "I'm actually a blonde."   "I thought so," the doctor said. "Your finger is broken."      3 construction guys were working on a skyscraper, up on the 40th floor.   At lunch, the bald guy said "Every day my wife packs me a tuna sandwich. If there's tuna again today, I'm gonna jump off this building!". He checks it & sure enough it's tuna again so old baldy jumps.   The redhead then says "Every day I get a cheese sandwich for lunch from my wife. If it's cheese again today then I'm jumping off here, too!". Sure enough, it's cheese so the redheaded guy jumps off.   Then the blond guy says "I always get a jelly sandwich. If it's jelly again then I'm jumping, too!". He checks & it's jelly so he jumps.   At the memorial service for the 3 guys, their wives are talking about this.   Both the bald guy's wife & the redhead's wife said the same thing, "I don't understand why my husband jumped. If I had know he wanted something else to eat for lunch, I'd have gave it to him.".   Then the blond man's wife says " I don't understand why my husband jumped. He always made his own lunch.".      A Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day. The Russian said, "We were the first in space!"   The American said, "We were the first on the moon!"   The Blonde said, "So what? We're going to be the first on the sun!"   The Russian and the American looked at each other and shook their heads. "You can't land on the sun, you idiot! You'll burn up!" said the Russian.   To which the Blonde replied, "We're not stupid, you know. We're going at night!"         A blonde woman was speeding down the road in her little red sports car and was pulled over by a woman police officer, who was also blonde. The blonde cop asked to see the blonde drivers license. She dug through her purse and was getting progressively more agitated. "What does it look like?" she finally asked  The police woman replied "It's square and it has your picture on it." The driver finially found a square mirror in her purse , looked at it and handed it tothe policewoman. "Here it is " she said.    The blonde officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying "Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop."      Two blondes living in Oklahoma were sitting on a bench talking....... and one blonde says to the other, "Which do you think is farther away... Florida or the moon?"   The other blonde turns and says "Helloooooooooo, can you see Florida ?????"       A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals. She proudly says, "Go ahead, ask me, I know all them." A friend says, "OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin?" The blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy: W."       A blonde went to electronics store and she asked, "How is much is this TV?" The salesman said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a brunette. She asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a red head and asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry we don't sell to blondes."   She replied, " I came in here as a brunette and a red head. How do you know I am a blonde?"   "Because that is not a TV, it's a microwave      A blonde calls Delta Airlines and asks, "Can you tell me how long it'll take to fly from San Francisco to New York City?" The agent replies, "Just a minute..." "Thank you," the blonde says, and hangs up.      Three blondes walk into a bar and ask the bartender for three shots of tequila. He looks at them and says "OK" and pours their shots. They all clink glasses and yell "51 days!" Then they proceed to slam the shots, looking very self-satisfied. They look back to the bartender and decide to order another round. This time they pick up the glasses again and, more gleefully yell Only 51 days!" The bartender finally can't stand wondering what they are talking about and asks them what they mean by Only 51 days. One of the blondes looks at him and says "Well," looking very smug. "We just finished a jigsaw puzzle. It took us Only 51 Days . . . . . and on the box it said 4-7 years"      Julie the blonde was getting pretty desperate for money. She decided to go to the nicer, richer neighborhoods around town and look for odd jobs as a handywoman. The first house she came to, a man answered the door and told Julie, "Yeah, I have a job for ya. How would you like to paint the porch?" "Sure that sounds great!" said Julie. "Well, uh, how much do you want?" asked the man. "Is fifty bucks OK?" Julie asked. "Yeah t|`|tyQnSkSnaa	A young reporter went to a retirement home to interview an aged but legendary explorer. The reporter asked the old man to tell him the most frightening experience he had ever had.   The old explorer said, "Once I was hunting Bengal tigers in the jungles of India. I was on a narrow path and my faithful native gunbearer was behind me. Suddenly the largest tiger I have ever seen leaped onto the path in front of us. I turned to get my weapon only to find the native had fled. The tiger leapt toward me with a mighty ROARRRR! I soiled myself."   The reporter said, "Under those circumstances anyone would have done the same."   The old explorer said, "No, not then - just now when I went ROARRRR!"|`|ej64kvS6aa	Not to be mean or anything but that was lame. my favorite is.....    A rooster laid an egg on top of the barn.

My wife asked, "Do you know her?"    "Yes," I sighed, "She's my old girlfriend. I understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear she hasn't been sober since."    "My Goodness!" said my wife, "Who would think a person could go on celebrating for that long?"    _________________    My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.     She said, "I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 200 in about 3   seconds."

24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	Nightwish is my favorite band so of course I choose them. Bullet for my Valentine has never caught my attention and I've only heard one song from them if I'm not mistaking and it didn't do much for me, I didn't like the music nor the singing.     Besides these two bands are really different from each other so it's hard to compare them when they are not the same genre and also not similar in sound.          P.S: Devin S there is no reason to give you thumbs down, you weren't disrespectful nor were you bashing the other band, and you said something completely true "Its all about a persons taste in music"|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Definitely Nightwish! BFMV is just mediocre radio-friendly metalcore in my opinion, whereas Nightwish is quite possibly the greatest symphonic metal band of all time, and Tarja is definitely one of the top 10 metal (if not all rock) female vocalists of all time. Nightwish defines symphonic metal, BFMV shames metalcore.|`|GG8x2kmfaa	I laughed when I read this question.. NIGHTWISH OF COURSE! Bullet for my valentine doesn't hold a candle to Nightwish. Nightwish is basically amazing in every aspect, even though Annette isn't my favorite singer ever, she's still pretty good, but Tarja is better.. Sorry, I ramble.  So my conclusion is Nightwish, whether with Tarja or Annette, is superior to BFMV by far.|`|zzkmdusEaa	From my side of the fence I have found Bullet For My Valentine much more appealing than Nightwish, i've a good fan of both but BFMV takes my cake. I think Bullet's guitar solos are  amazingly sick, Nightwish just doesn't do it for me, although I do enjoy listening to them.    This will be a hard debate to solve. Its all about a persons taste in music, what is good to one is terrible to another and vice versa. I noticed the answerer above me threw in his lot with Nightwish, I threw in mine with Bullet. It is a very conflicting debocle to name the inferior band based on opinions.    Better in general....I say Bullet...My opinion and i'm sticking to it.    P.S. I'm quite sure my comment will recieve many thumbs down from all the nightwish fans reading this.|`|2bVLbo6Daa	BFMV is overall extremelly good.  their a crowd pleaser live thats a definate.  Nightwish used to get stagefright when they started.    2nd: Bullets guitar=epic riffs and fast heartpounding solos!  Nightwish: some power chords and occasional cool riffs but their all in the effects and piano.    not to mention their two different genres i suppose.  i mean, nightwish is a cool rock band but Bullet is metalcore and in my opinion BULLET IS OVER THE TOP, OVER THE TOP!|`|azIA2rmRaa	Nightwish, definitely.    But they are coming from two, totally different extremes. Some people like just straight up Metalcore or whatever you should called BFMV. And some people (the smart ones ;) appreciate the complexity of Symphonic Metal. =)

ZzqWzFNiaa	Personally, I blame Nirvana, but not for being Nirvana. I actually think Nirvana was quite good.    See, what happened in my opinion was Kurt Cobain dies and a vacuum is created where people tried to grab ahold of their momentum and tweak their sound in different directions to make it more commercial. At the same time Nevermind opened the door for Dookie, which was the real rise of pop punk in a corporatist sense. Mainstream rock never recovered from the Nirvana vacuum, or from what Green Day (who I'm personally not quite so down on, not out buying records, but they're fine) opened the door for. It's actually just gotten worse and worse.    A bit of blame belongs to Eddie Vedder too. I like the way he sings, but I'm not a fan of it being copied. That sort of constipated sound that became en vogue in his wake.|`|diWKJGUvaa	Thank Buddah for Classic Rock otherwise I would have taken a 38 to the head by now...      http://mitkadem3.homestead.com/files/Jet...|`|614d9c4d7bb2ebab6d73ea0000065cfeaa	no one killed it where are you! rock one  will never die and two its up to you to keep those bands like saliva and shinedown 3 doors down  these bands are very well and alive! don't turn your back on the now and be sure to rock on!|`|TnhjF7JCaa	Fall out boy was def. the fall of alternative rock. I use to think that FOB was a great alt-rock band, but then they started being complete sell outs. But because they were originally put out as alt. kids started to think that they were listening to rock, which i think started the whole camp 'rock' sh*t going around. I know a lot of kids who go to my school who think they're listening to 'different' music, and that it's rock, when it's pure pop. IF kids who listen to FOb or Nickelback listened to actual rock, I bet you anything they wouldn't like it.|`|jFrxyRLwaa	It was Nickelback. And All time low was there before fallout boy. Fallout boy ruined all time low|`|e3n5IcZ3aa	Nickelback.     Fall Out Boy's first mainstream success album will always be one of my favourites. They were awesome back then, and Sugar We're Going Down Swinging - even though mainstreamy - is such an awesomee song. For a bit, they were amazing mainstream, but then they slowly turned horrible. Now they're terrible, which is sad.    However, Nickelback sucked from the beginning. They weren't ever good in the first place, and they still suck. They kill any song they sing. They're not even that talented, most of their stuff is terrible -- at least Pete Wentz was a good lyricist.    And...  ALL TIME LOW RULE by the way     =]  Their music is so cute, and they're not really a Fall Out Boy clone - they're more in the pop-punk genre and their music seems way happier than Fall Out Boy's.|`|0CjkEK7Raa	I think Nickelback. Every time I turn on the radio I hear a ton of bands that all sound exactly the same and all sound like Nickelback.   (Saving Abel, Seether, Theory of A Deadman, Hinder, and countless others)  I gets so annoying when I am listening to a station that plays a mix of classic and modern rock and one of these bands comes on.  I can't really tell any of them apart and they all suck.|`|VIY5j7YFaa	Nickelback did.|`|lWoI0Xwsaa	Nickleback 3 Doors Down are post grunge idiots, who can't get over the fact that grunge died ALONG time ago. So they make music that sounds similar to grunge in a later generation, and it sucks!    I like grunge myself, but when you see idiots like Nickleback and 3 Doors Down, just laugh and change the station. 90's been gone for a a long time and it won't be back again.    I don't know what the **** Hinder is thinking right now. There's a million nobody indie bands that sound identical to them,    Fall Out Boy and Save Abel, All Time Low, are bands that are current, and bands like that are working to promote a genre called "Emo" which is current and popular in many rockers today.    You know  of course I love my Nirvana, STP, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, and  grunge bands like that- BUT ITS DEAD, GONE, BEEN GONE FOR A LONG TIME, AND IT AINT COMING BACK. OUT WITH THE OLD PEOPLE IN WITH THE NEW!     Not to say older rock sucks, I love it. But bands need to be more modern and stop being outdated posers. Thats all.|`|FDt7cC8haa	Nickelback, 3 Doors Down, Seether, Daughtry, Creed,...those bands all sound alike...and can lick my twig and berries|`|AA11166769	I think things started to go downhill with the onslaught of Nirvana and Pearl Jam.|`|VFc9leFmaa	your mom|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I think it's been dead for awhile.

Nickelback is the single worst mainstream rock band I've heard.|`|VnCvn1mnaa	you have the idiot fans of these idiot bands to thank for the downfall in music, or change if you wan to put it nicely.  The only reason these bands are getting such huge pushes from the record labels and mtv etc. is because of one simple fact, the mainstream audience in America is DUMB!.  There i said it.  its not entirely b/c of the lack of intelligence, its the simple fact that the mainstream demo if you will is between the ages of 13-25 typicaly.  There is a whole world of music out there that is being produced right now that is so good, but most of these mainstreamers will never even have a clue b/c they are stuck in this "comfort zone" of music.  They have been exposed to a limited amount of substance throughout their lives and wouldnt even know where to begin to look for new music if they even had the inclination to.  The record comanies dont put out "crap" and force it upon people, they spend millions and millions of dollars every year to find out what people like.  So all in all it comes down to the simple fact of supply and demand.  If the public demands simple easily produced generic   garbage then the record companies will be more than happy to oblige.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Parts of it remind me of "Burnt Offerings" (1976), in which a family from the city~father, mother, son and father's aunt~move into a big house for the summer. There is an elderly woman in one of the rooms whom they are to take care of, but there is something mysterious and sinister about her. There is a music box in the old woman's room, where the mother begins spending a lot of time.     The father has nightmares about an eerie hearse and driver, as well as his parents' funeral when he was a child. He starts seeing the hearse and driver when he's awake. Also, each time someone is injured or becomes ill, the house renews itself a bit more.    Here's the opening to the movie:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqgcQwQmd...  You can see and hear the music box at 4.00:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wn4o0Gfr...    I'm trying to think of another film that might have a little girl instead of a boy. Generally, I recall movies featuring music boxes, as my mother collects them. I love the music composer Robert Colbert writes for music boxes, such as those featured in "Dark Shadows" and "Burnt Offerings".     One movie I know that has a family moving into a house, followed by strange goings-on is "The Watcher in the Woods", only there are two daughters. I don't recall a music box.

He does look gay.    Not that there's anything wrong with that.    It's just not attractive to females is all.|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	zac efron is ugly|`|3yYozfpjaa	He's cute.. in an incredibly flamboyant sort of way...|`|AOaLfkEoaa	He is sooooo NOT hot    a  TOTALLY agree with you.|`|QzT6DV0Aaa	His hair and eyes are amazing.

I know he's dating Vanessa Hudgens but he is just too fruity! I seen a photoshoot picture of him, in a tight shirt and pouting x|    he's ugly!|`|7JIG6Rw4aa	He is ugliiii.....  he IS gay   HE probably buys his clothes from the gay shop  and cuts his nair in the gay hair dressers|`|bOPCnScpaa	na not good looking just has a cheeky smile|`|oyWo5T0jaa	i don't think he's hot.   :\  Sure, I'm somewhat of a fan for HSM...  but he's uhrm...pretty average to me.|`|DUljObM0aa	Not really, he has a kind of mouth problem when he talks its slightly crooked, but then again he has BEAUTIFUL blue eyes and a FITT body.|`|cQgKfGe6aa	urgh! hes disgusting. did you know he wears foundation and lipgloss for his photo shoots etc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He's way too gay for my liking, I'm a girl who prefers her guys to be more masculine, thanks! I don't want them hopping around and singing about getting your head in the game or whatever.  It's basketball, you don't need to shout about it.  I'm not a fan of the whole HSM franchise. it appears to be a normal high school, but suddenly EVERYONE is a professional dancer and singer!  Please, Disney, bring back The Lion King for god's sake!|`|lddM2JzHaa	yes,hes hot,but hes a kids film star!!!so its a bit wierd...|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	His uglyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  his face scares me !|`|5lmC19GLaa	hes got gorgeous hair, eyes, mouth , face lol    hes the perfect man|`|LDLTjNCraa	It was his eyes and hair in HSM1 that did it for me.

6502da0359098db5ff94c467a575938faa	I don't remember all their names, i only watched the last one.  But, I like Naomi and Melissa. I also liked Nikki and did not think it fair to have him choose two for that date and send one home.  What if he liked both, and both should have moved on?|`|VoV7jGc3aa	I heard that Melissa wins, but you know how rumors go.... I really like Stephanie and I think that she and Jason would have a nice blended family if he were to choose her. However, I don't think that he feels as much chemistry with her as the other girls (I think he has kept her because he is wanting to have feelings for her though) so I think he will send her home next and the other girls will be the remaining 4.|`|Ofn5VWInaa	idk, but i want the one that looks like eva mendes to win|`|VU79ZuFbaa	Molly, Melissa, Naomi, and Jillian|`|hkQSqPEwaa	I am just happy that evil meagan is gone.  She is mean.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I have no idea... they all look alike to me|`|DSSio06daa	I watch it faithfully but I don't have all the names down.  I don't love Melissa to be honest, I don't know why, I just don't, actually, I don't really like any of them that much right now, they all seem about as fake as their boobs.  I did like the mom whos husband died but that scene on the beach when her daughter was brought on by surprise and then the nauseating painful fake date they went on as a family really brought the bile to the back of my throat...YUK.    I am just not sure he will pick any of them.  I am divorced with children and remarried and I don't think I would have wanted to find a new husband and step-parent for my children on reality t.v...you know what I mean?  I am just not sure, esp. when kids are involved, that it would be where you would find the cream of the crop.
vW7szpvNaa	Back up, I'm not THAT old yet.  The Earth has become what we made it.  It can also be changed the same way.  We just need to want it enough.|`|RSJbqioUaa	Well, I'm guessing your older.

Kind of why I only want to have one child.|`|bl0RZJrDaa	I am not planning on having children|`|uKSsXz2iaa	We'll see what happens|`|4myG3rbKaa	yes they are going to blow up because of global warming and all of the polar bears are dieing :(!|`|mYeq5AvFaa	what if i don't have any grandchildren|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Nope.|`|bHPHp6lwaa	Definitely !!!

God will help them.|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	I feel bad for myself! I'm only 14, and look at the wreck you adults are leaving us!|`|jH88I6lDaa	Yes, our grandchildren are going to have grandmothers with tattoo's naval piercings and tongue piercing, and genital piercing,  Could you imagine your grandparents if they were like that?  Grandma has dumbbells in her nipples.  Wait, so does grandpa and grandma's tramp stamp used to be a design now it's just a black mark in her butt crack.      lmao   J/K    : )      But something to think about.  Our kids will have modern technologies to hopefully improve our world, and give them more hope than we can see today.  I only wish our grand kids the best and I hope they are smarter than us.    Peace!|`|AA11820279	yes because of wat has become of this world and we are leaving them really nothing tho

KQmN5lDEaa	ROFL!!!!!!! That is the funniest thing I have ever heard!  Tell the company to go screw themselves.  I would say it is your boss's fault.  For one, it was his birthday, and if he knows you he shouldn't celebrate his birthday in the office.  Also, he should have know it was coming if he were actually supervising you, and stopped you!  Blame the boss and make him give you 3 vacation days for his horrible behavior!|`|p9KwrW6Maa	well, all i have to say is if you are on the job and you take the time cut up post its for confetti u shouldn't have been hired, rather than take your vaca days they should just make you pay for the damages and the mess.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	I'm not sure if i should laugh :) or feel bad for you :(.
g2oLE2CMaa	While psychic help is not so wise over the internet I know that the job is not right for you. I know you had some sort of passion that you truly excelled in while you were in secondary school. For some reason you gave it up.. Try to remember what that was and perhaps it may lead you in the proper direction.   I wish I could be more help but alas these next few steps, oh so critical to your success in life, must be made by you and only you. Godspeed.

UhL7m301aa	A keyboard is electronic, a piano is mechanical.     A keyboard is a piano synthesizer that mimics the sound of the piano.     If you are considering buying a keyboard (they are often cheaper) look for brands which are "electronic pianos" (don't be confused, they are still keyboards) as they tend to have weighted keys and are touch sensitive.     Really, nothing compares to the soud of a real piano but the Yamaha Clavinova line of keyboards really does a great job and comes very very close (I have a clavinova at home) and that line of keyboards has weighted keys (necessary for building finger strength) and is touch sensitive.     Good luck!  Piano is a great instrument to learn as all of music theory is based on it.|`|L6jKwlyXaa	In an acoustic piano, the sound is created by mechanical hammers striking strings, causing them to vibrate. As a result of centuries of development, its keys are now made in such a way that the pianist has much control over the resulting sound, and a vast range of sounds can be made.    Keyboard (electronic organ etc.) keys only switch tone on and the sound is mainly controlled by a set of toggle or slide switches. These switches allow to change over to different instruments (or noises), control colour of tone, change automatic accompanient and so on. More complex (and costly) keyboards offer a greater range of these features but all of them are generally only "on/off" features and the number of usable combinations is limited.     Standard piano has 88 keys. Keyboards with 88 keys are good. Anything with less than 76 keys is pretty much useless - some pieces cannot be played.    If you are serious about learning, learn the piano, if you just want to see if you like it or not, learn the keyboard.|`|mYeq5AvFaa	keyboard are the electronic ones|`|UJrZHOLvaa	Original pianos are not electronic: they don't have music synthesizers built in. Though you do get electronic pianos these days. The keys are usually sensitive to touch and make different levels of sound depending on how hard you push them down.    Keyboards are music synthesizers. These days they're built to look exactly and sound exactly like pianos. Some of them actually have the entire sensitivity to touch thing, but it's not half as effective as a proper piano.    I'd suggest you learnt the piano and not the keyboard, it'll help in the long run. But, if you're looking to invest in a piano, i'd suggest a baby grand electronic. They're fabulous. Hope this helps :)

Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.    The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other.

HLh4cgiiaa	Leo isn't just a star sign - it's the star sign, the sign of the stars. Every Leo knows that they are the show, the center of attention, the natural number one. Leo is at the center of the zodiac in the same way that the Sun is at the center of the solar system and being a Leo gives you all the qualities of the Sun - you are warm, radiant and loved by almost everybody. You can light up a room by being in it, in the same way that the Sun can light up a dull day by coming out of the clouds. Any party is a better party when the Leo arrives- things are somehow dull without you.    Leos are natural winners and you get your way through an interesting blend of selfishness and generosity. It works as follows: you know that you are quiet simply the best person imaginable. Self-doubt, self-criticism, shyness and reticence were all left out of the recipe somewhere when you were made - they simply do not occur in the sign of Leo.    Personality is the Leo strong point. When so desiring, the Leo charm can tame serpents and turn the world at large into an adoring enclave. At best you give off a scintillating sort of radiance. You are positive, enthusiastic, spirited, dynamic and larger than life. Leos are highly self-centered however, you manage to pull it off with an air that usually doesn't offend anyone because you are so generous and enthusiastic. Along with this comes a sense of humor that is dazzling and childlike.     Leo is the sign of the child and when provoked, you can be enormously childish. If pushed too far, Leo can be like a vociferous member of the terrible twos. During such moments no one else exists. However the storm usually does not last long. The clouds are impatiently blown away and once again the sun comes out.    Leos are also terrific organizers. Kings, chairman, governors, leaders of all kinds: they all require Leonine qualities and it is much easier to be one than become one.     Leo homes are like palaces which is only to be expected from the royal sign. Only the best is good enough for you and at home you like to remind yourself of how fine a person you are, especially when the world has been giving you a hard time. There is nothing in your house which is small and dainty. Your taste in furniture is traditional but large and definitely luxurious!    Leos have a hearty appetite and a liking for good food. Fire signs are the zodiac's meat-eaters and that includes you of course. With an appetite as big as you are likely to be quite solidly built. Whatever you eat it has to be of the finest quality.    Unwilling to change, slightly lazy and a little pompous, but mostly, Leo, you are what we all need and life would be a darker and colder place without you.    Keywords: The glyph above represents the lion. Leo rules procreation and creativity. Here we have approval, dignity, recognition, applause, romance, dynamism, magnetism, pride/shame, limelight, extroversion, impact, larger-than-life themes and stage presence. Leo is creative, risk-taking, charismatic, fun-loving, generous, exciting, dramatic, proud, self-confident, childish, ambitious, arrogant, self-conscious (fears ridicule), enthusiastic.    Best qualities: Zest for life, Generosity, Ability to organize and lead   Worst Qualities: Pride, Extravagance, Self-centeredness   Best Match: Gemini   Worst Match: Capricorn   Favorite Weakness: Playing to the crowd   Best Day: Sunday   Worst Day: Saturday   Lucky Numbers: 5, 6, 1   Colors: Gold, Rich reds and purples, Royal colors   Birthstone: Diamond   Tree: Ash   Flowers: Poppy, Marigold   Fruits: All citrus fruits   Metal: Gold          HOPE IT HELPED YOU|`|dmxnblomaa	I have a leo ascendent and Leo sun, I am very Loyal, Freaky ready to go at all times, Very independent, think very highly of myself, carry myself like a stuck up woman but at the same time very friendly, I also can get along wfith everybody.

Yes Angelina was the hottest stuff since sliced bread and has really portrayed the character in a way you would only imagine it to be played, but Megan Fox is the next hottest thing since Angie! SHe is younger , and just as sexy. But, I do feel that Megan is trying too hard to be just like angie and needs to develop her own schmeil.

It took me a while to accept their relationship, primarily because I knew it was doomed to fail.  Edward, a vampire, will outlive Bella, who will eventually get old.  However, I could understand Bellas attraction to Edward: hes gorgeous, hes interested in her (a huge introvert), and hes different.  Bella was never one of the popular kids in school and aligning herself with the outcast crowd seems appropriate. Note: as of this writing Ive only read Twilight, not the other books in the series.   Any film would be hard pressed to capture the burgeoning relationship between Edward and Bella.  There are scenes in the book in which they simply spend time talking.  It would be difficult to convey these scenes on the big screen without boring the audience and increasing the films length.  Therefore people who have read the books will more easily accept their relationship; people who havent read the first book might not buy Bellas unwavering love for Edward.     The Cullens and sunlight.   In Twilight the book Edward explains that he and his family dont go out in the sunlight because their skin sparkles.   The special effects were actually pretty well done.  I initially expected something more spectacular but what they did actually worked.     Bella is extremely clumsy.   This is illustrated several times in Twilight the book and helps explain Bellas accident at the Cullens home and her reluctance to engage in physical activities like dancing.   Bellas clumsiness is referenced only once during the film.     Bella has a strong aversion to blood.   In the book Bella passes out when she and Edward perform a blood typing experiment in class.   This scene isnt included in the movie.     Alice and Jasper guard Bella.   In the book Bella decides to ditch Alice and Jasper at the hotel where theyre hiding out from James, the homicidal vampire with enhanced tracking skills.   In Twilight the Movie Bella abandons Alice and Jasper at an airport, and leaves a note for Edward.     Some of the vampire kids in the Cullen family have special powers.   As per the book:    Edward: can read minds (except Bellas).    Alice: can see the future.    Jasper: feels the emotions of those around him and has the power to alter them.   Only Edward and Alices powers are explained in the movie.  Had they explained Jaspers power (and his background) it might have helped justify his deer in the headlight look in the film.  I wonder what Jackson Rathbone (the actor portraying Jasper) thinks of his onscreen persona.     Jacob Black and Bellas relationship.   Bella first meets Jacob at a beach outing with some of the kids from school.  She later flirts with him specifically to learn more about him, his people, and why they appear to dislike the Cullens.   Bella meets Jacob at the beginning of the film, when he brings his father Billy Black to visit Bellas father.  Bella and Jacob dont have many scenes together in the film.     Prom night.   In Twilight the book, the prom takes place in the high school gym.   In Twilight the movie the prom occurs at a REALLY NICE bed and breakfast.  The prom is quite fancy looking for such a small town.     Edward kills James.   In the book we never get the details about what transpires between Edward and James; we simply know that he killed James.   The movie shows us how Edward kills James.  As a matter of fact, this is one of the pivotal scenes in the film.  Additionally, we learn that the other Cullen kids are present at the time of the killing.     The Nomads (James, Laurent, and Victoria)   Were first introduced to the Nomads when they approach the Cullens during a family baseball game.   The movie does a great job of foreshadowing by first illustrating the  viciousness of the Nomads.  When they meet the Cullens we immediately understand the importance of hiding Bella from them.|`|D27mJKmWaa	Film is amazing.  So are the books.

You should see it, but if you read the book, there's going to be a lot of parts that they skipped from the book.|`|53VfGk7caa	well since Twilight is the movie of the first book only you should be knowing what to expect from it :)  The movie was really great, but they cut out the scene where bella fainted for the sight of blood.   Some of the scenes are different but have the same lines as the book. But, Just to tell u, the movie, sorta ruins YOUR imagination of the characters, some 'OMG' girls would have pictured edward so much more amazingly... and bella differently and u get me.    But in my opinion, The movie was really worth-while. :)|`|nppWl0RMaa	The movie was okay I guess.

I hear if you see it a second time, its better, but I am not going to spend my money to see it a second time in the theater.  I will wait until it is out on DVD.    I am ok with the actors they chose for all the characters... I think they portray them pretty well.    I am very upset that they changed a lot of details that were in the book.  I am not sure if it was because of time constraints or budget... to be honest, I don't care... there are just some details that should not have been changed.    All in all... the movie was entertaining, but it does not IN ANY WAY live up to the hype of the book.|`|aQYx3H41aa	i LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE it   the book was a bit better though

gJhwH335aa	Which one are you referring to? Comics or movie?    The Joker origin has been tell several times in Batman graphic novels. Most of the origin lead to the same thing. The Joker fell off into a chemical waste (in The Killing Joke) or chemical vats (in The Red Hood) after trying to escape from Batman (alone in Killing Joke but with Robin in The Red Hood). The Joker emerged from the chemical with bleached skin, green hair and a PERMANENT GRIN on his face. Batman didn't know what exactly happen because the only thing he's seeing and done was trying to captured a villain called Red Hood. He didn't know he accidentally 'created' The Joker at the time as quoted by himself in The Killing Joke;    "I've been trying to figure out what he intends to do. It almost impossible. I don't know him, Alfred.     All these years and I don't know who he is any more than he knows who I am. How can two people hate so much without knowing each other?"    and as quoted by The Joker in The Killing Joke    "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"    "Remember? Ohh, I wouldn't do that! Remembering is dangreous. I find the past such a worrying, anxious place. THE PAST TENSE, I suppose you'd call it."    Whereas The Joker in The Dark Knight movie wears make up/war paint symbolize he's an anarchist unlike the comics. In The Dark Knight, he told several different story of how he getting the scars. One of them are about his father was a drinker, and a fiend.     "One night, he goes off a little crazier than usual... Naturally, mommy grabs the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that.    Not - One - Bit    So he grabs mommy, takes the knife to her, laughing as he does it, and he turns to him and says:    Why so SERIOUS?    He pushes mommy aside, takes the knife to his son, puts it to his mouth, and says:    WHY SO SERIOUS? Let's put a smile on that face!"    The writers of Dark Knight agree to make The Joker as a villain without a background. They never want to tell people who The Joker really is. The Joker background in the movie is open to everyone opinion which probably intended to give the character the sense of both enigmatic and charismatic. In the end, we will never know the real back story for Joker character. All of the story are vague and obscure.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	It is unknown how The Joker really got his scars. In The Dark Knight, he says once that it was his father and once that he'd done it himself; it is not that he is lying, it is that The Joker can never remember his past the same way twice, therefore having a different story every time. Of course, he got his scars in a freak accident, probably from a knife because he seems to have an attachment to them and always mention them in his 'memories'. Also, The Joker never lies; well, almost never. You can be assured that he wouldn't lie about his past - he is just too amused with everyone's reactions. He only lied about one thing during the entire movie and that was the whereabouts of Rachel and Harvey - he gave the right adresses, but knew that Batman would save Rachel so he switched them around so that Batman and Harvey would be crushed. Pretty intelligent...truth all the way through, in the end, everyone believes him. Gotta love him. And I'm off topic now. Anyway, of course this is for the movie only.     In the original comics, he got his scars because of chemical waste which also resulted in other parts of his physical appearance, as others have already mentioned.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	His father took a knife to his face in a drunken rage|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	He fell into a vat of chemical waste|`|LihoWe84aa	thats one of the big mysteries of the movie. WE DONT KNOW!  he changes the story from he got it from his drunk dad after the dad killed the mom to he did it for his wife after drug dealers did the same to her and then she left him. Hope i helped  Rebecca|`|AA11110732	In the new movie "Dark Knight", his scars appear to be what is called a "Glasgow Grin" which is what some muggers in that area do to their victims.    To inflict such an injury with that type of scarring, one would have to be cut from inside both sides of the mouth, then have it stitched back together and then the wounds would heal over. The result would be deep scars in the form of an extended grin.    Scottish actor Tommy Flanagan was attacked and still bears these distinctive scars.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	he used to play prop forward for neath|`|LLvetbbpaa	The joker has stories for how he got his scars.  In the original comics, Joker got his scars from acid. Now he makes up stories about it so often perhaps not even he is sure. it continues to offer stories of the scars.|`|QTxdNavKaa	He did it to himself...|`|wZbez89uaa	batman bit him to much|`|IDTQwgBaaa	In the original story I think Batman threw him to an acid container cause the Joker was there when Joe Chill killed, Bruce Wayne's parents.|`|Md16KeXmaa	In the film he says two reasons:  his dad did it to him when he was younger  and that he did it for his wife    but in the comic book he fell into a vat of chemical waste resulting his in green hair, white face and ginormous grin.     But on the dark night film it looks like an over the top Chelsea Smile / Chelsea Grin / Glasgow Grin etc    which is where the victim is cut on the inside and outside of the mouth.    another film called it the Chelsea Grin - Green Street Hooligans|`|gYThMID8aa	Something flew into his face and he asked;  "Was that a robin boy?" and the answer came back;  "No it was a bat man!"|`|lKVtFdv9aa	he fell in acid|`|ObfEroZMaa	He smiled to much and his face got stuck that way.|`|ou6JBxNLaa	in the story his dad did it to him when he was a boy|`|xKyz0zzFaa	The point of the joker is he has no backstory he tells many different tales to how he aquired them but no 2 stories the same if we are to believed one of tem is true it could be either:    He did it himself to make it easier for his scarred wife.  or  His father did it to him when he was young    in one of the comic books he falls into chemical-ridden water and goes insane
jUg9HAOjaa	Definitely "Chariots of Fire" by Vangelis    Well, actually it was first called "Titles", because it was the theme song playing at the beginning of the 1981 movie "Chariots of Fire" during the opening titles.|`|TBbhmZEwaa	Viva la Vida- coldplay|`|UTKYOWdaaa	it's by cold play|`|xTpvnWRuaa	Cold Play I'm sure.|`|nMd0UF2Aaa	Coldplay - Viva La Vida    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xW...|`|AA10903317	Chariots of Fire" by Vangelis|`|qG752H8Qaa	it sounds like its by cold play|`|EwO7Uowuaa	The song is called Viva La Vida and it's performed by Coldplay

3jFm0rWdaa	This song is heavy on guitar, with minimal keyboards in the first low note, and then the repeating theme during the guitar lead.  Rush isn't very big on harmony - so I don't know where that is.  Of course the rythm comes from their excellent, world renowned drummer, Neil Peart.

I love seeing fans of GOOD music!    Props to you!|`|khU8m4gxaa	I think Lil Wayne's OK. He's considered among the best because he constantly said it himself. If you keep hearing the same thing over and over again you start to believe it. It's the same reason an awful MC like Mike Jones went platinum. He kept telling everyone when his CD was coming out and how you could call him. Well, it worked because a million people copped it. Wayne's light years ahead of Jones, but you see what I mean. Everybody believed the hype. I give Lil Wayne all the credit in the world for constantly having new freestyles and guest appearances out for years, and for being the most improved rapper of the last 5 years. I'm embarrased by him though. How a dude nearly 30 years old, successful, with children of his own can join a street gang is beyond my comprehension. How you can justify kissing another dude on the lips is ridiculous too. But either way, I agree that Nas is the best MC alive. Wish he picked better beats though.|`|JKtw7nFMaa	honestly--- KRS-one, hands down|`|aJfBtT9iaa	nas|`|m2UUrurBaa	besides the speculation of his affiliations, his inability to speak properly and any other discrepancy, he should never be mentioned in the same sentence as Nas, i don't care if they're headlined together.|`|OpBFc27iaa	Lupe and NaS are two of my favorites.    NaS|`|CyB99JyGaa	Lupe Fiasco|`|kuxVB76maa	Lupe! Superstar and Kick Push are the best songs eva!|`|Tdu1kPz0aa	Both Lupe And Nas|`|nFiv4hXzaa	Nas owns all of them like God owns the world.|`|2gsTDwwEaa	Little wayne is terrible. He sound like he has dookie in his mouth.  Lupe Fiasco that's your opinion.....  NAS is nasty. Top 10 rappers of all time. Certified!|`|cm4QYmAYaa	I absolutely agree that Wayne should not be included with the greats and I also agree that Nas is the best rapper alive followed closely by Jigga Man.  My opinion on Wayne's popularity is that he caters to a younger generation of hip hop heads who don't relate with the older generation greats such as Nas.  Also Wayne caters to individuals who enjoy other genres of music so he qualifies more as a Pop artist than a true hip hop artist.  This is evidenced through the simple fact that you would never catch Nas flowing over most of the beats or doing colabos with half the artist that you will hear Wayne doing.  As hip hop has become more mainstream, a very thin line has been draw between what I call commercial hip pop and real hip hop.  Wayne walks that fine line and as of late has leaned more towards the commercial hip pop while Nas has never even come close to that line.  With the exception of his song Owe Me feat. Ginuine on the Nastradamus album, Nas has always been hip hop.|`|CXxZx3KMaa	Nas|`|KoNHUcNUaa	First off let me say that  i agree with you 100%. Wayne is the most overrated rapper in hip hop. He could fart and speak gibberish on a record and people will think that's hot, and that would be number 1 on 106 and park.     But To Answer your question -Nasir Olu Dara Jones. But Lupe is definitely hot.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Lupe.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	Lupe Fiasco: Has a point to his songs, you CAN understand him.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Nas.    Lil Wayne is considered the "greatest rapper alive" because he's the most popular right now... in 2-3 years, his popularity will die out and he will be forgotten...

uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate and secure, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Youtube then www.mediaconverter.org|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	THE problem with being a PIRATE is it's difficult to keep viruses at BAY.

I love this site|`|eUdk3VUvaa	You can try http://searchformp3s.net  You can download straight from there or you can just listen to the music from there.    No need to download any programs, just download the mp3's directly from the website!|`|46T2YwUgaa	Limewire or Kazha...but be careful...its a portal for computer viruses|`|AA12069279	try 4share.com  a good place and fast.|`|6GfekBjIaa	as you've learned ...nothing is for free....even limewire makes u pay with all those viruses....other formats dont cover all and every title and artist... your best bet is to buy a subscription membership to mp3 rocket...unlimited dnlds until your scipt is up...good luck....  ps.. been ther dun dat|`|JKtw7nFMaa	heres what you do, download the program called Vuze...you will not find the stuff you want on vuze but here is how you can. go to the pirate bay or any other torrent site and search for what you want and then click download, select vuze to download it|`|AA12259805	try frostwire|`|LsO5TX9Haa	Try    http://gsbloggers.blogspot.com/2008/12/a...    you can download hindi, tamil, telegu songs free|`|yFPXwT0Jaa	try imeem|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|FtS5SSeSaa	Sometimes in lime wire u get viruses because u download songs where it says u need more sources so try another one

Its bad enough hollywood can't think of original ideas anymore.. they have to resort to killing the classics. :[|`|U5hxXYOQaa	I really hope they don't remake that movie.

I know.|`|EjSjwTfuaa	I think that certain scenes in the movie would have to change but I think it could come out and have a good outcome. I think if the right people were cast it would make a greater impact but studios might just go for good looking lame kids like from high school musical Zack Effron would be the jock and ashley tisdale would be the popular girl... EW and that would ruin things for some but not the little kids.|`|dRXOCGnSaa	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Personally I wouldn't want to see a remake. But if I were a director assigned to the project, I would base the movie on the original but not do an exact remake. I would create the same premise though (stuck in detention on a Saturday) but use entirely different characters and focus on issues of today. Something that todays teens can relate to.

94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Grab any 10 people, ask them to name 5 Kiss songs and 5 Led Zeppelin songs.    Said 10 people will say:  KISS: "Beth", "Rock and Roll All Night"...uh, uh, uh didn't they have that song in the 80's? uh...Lick it Up, that's it! How many is that? 2 more...um um um" [If you're lucky they remember "Christine Sixteen" and make it 4 if they're a little older.]    LED ZEPPELIN: "Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll, that song where they go Hey Hey Mama, like the way you move, whatever that's called, Kashmir, and Nobody's Fault but Mine"    And yes I realize the "Hey hey mama" song is called "Black Dog" but the average person probably doesn't.    Led Zeppelin has had the more storied and varied career musically, more extensive influence (by bringing folk influence to hard rock in songs like "Bron-y-aur Stomp" and reggae influence with "D'yer Mak'r") and ex-members Robert Plant and Jimmy Page continue to attract critical attention on their own..unlike a new Bruce Kulick album.|`|g3hfy9Ziaa	Led Zeppelin to both since they changed blues rock and hard rock forever and they were real musicians while Kiss was a cruddy gimmick band.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	kiss|`|yS61H04haa	Zep , for sure.

26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	Women are more shallow|`|gVYfFSpRaa	That's not true.  Most guys think that about women just because the women are shy and they're waiting for the guy to make the first move.      So guys.|`|TqSGFIFUaa	i think we are both equally shallow.  I agree with what you say but the same applies for men when picking a woman.  Women have to be skinny and look a certain way before men acknowledge them.|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	both. i'll admit I'm pretty shallow. but I try to give everyone a chance.|`|E5aMuyVhaa	You know, i was going to say men, right off the top of my head, but they are exactly the same...    everyone is shallow in our own saddening ways!|`|j0zr27YFaa	MEN!!!!!!!!!!  geeeeeez i've seen more hot girls with horrible looking guys  than hot guys with horrible looking girls|`|6mBNjrGTaa	I agree, women. I'm really shallow, and i don't mean to be, but i guess i am :p|`|ouXbJLbOaa	both are shallow. men and women both judge people on their looks even if they dont mean too.|`|ZhIVvlLPaa	Men are shallow in terms of just looks, but women are with looks AND money AND a lot more......... not ALL women, but the ones that are, are so atrocious that it just overtakes the mens shallowness..... so i'd say women|`|GRa8dmx7aa	men|`|70OHpjySaa	Patrick is funny with his "Yes, I totally agree! That's awesome!" answer to all questions. I wondered if he gets any best answer...    I pity the 35% of women that ARE NOT attractive!  I think everybody is picky...but not for the same things.     Men are visual and they'll like anything sexy or just willing, especially if they are liked back. I even think an ugly girl who want them is better than a cute girl who ignore them.    Women don't care about looks and receding hairlines. They want a man who will be nice to them, take care of them, not lie to them or beat them up.     Women seem to be more picky because they're more careful. Men don't care if that sexy girl is a potential stalker.|`|qJKVY5qwaa	lmao i dont agree :P|`|8grZo1E9aa	I think it's a 50/50 split....a lot of men want women to look a certain way, and women get caught up in their own appearances as a result and then judge others|`|GqcQoXKSaa	False.  Men are more shallow.    Men are all about looks, if a girl isn't even remotely attractive- forget it!  You're more likely to find a hot girl dating a not-so-hot guy, (see "Beauty and the Beast* for eg), but never the way around.    Women can look past the physical, but men care more about how he'll look with her.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	Taking a major risk here, I say MEN are more shallow. They do not know how to become grounded to the earth below their feet. Or where they exist within the space around them...possibly this is the result of not being impregnated and having to carry a child inside them for 9 months. That calls for the greatest responsibility which exists.  Not to hurt anyone's feelings but I do believe men miss on an awful lot which is essential if wanting too experience many types of psychic depths. If the answer is not liked, do be fair...and remember, YOU asked the question to be answered with honesty, I'd like to believe!|`|Kbgc6x5raa	men.    i'm not too picky.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Yes, I totally agree! That's awesome!

It could also be a quote for something you are selling.  I have done both and you customize it for the specific need.  I sell machinery and write proposals everyday.  I have also created a business plan that was a proposal to management.    A report to me is just that, a past event that has been documented with facts.  I don't see a report being that similar to a proposal because of the intent.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	no|`|1nSH0YGMaa	nope never written one.|`|AGl4ifkLaa	Yeah..I purposed to my now exe that we become exes....|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I've written a few, mostly in college. Most were precursors to things I wanted to study or experiments I wanted to preform. Basically the what, where, how, when, of what I wanted to do and then the why. Usually what started as a proposal later became a project or paper. In my experience proposals are easy, help you get you head around what you want to do, and short (well at least shorter then the paper you will have to write later on).

bc6MlMyoaa	This answer assumes that your project is not due for at least a day or two.    Anyway, one way to find a list of such music would be to go to pandora.com, a website with internet radio that plays songs related to the music you want to hear.      So, head over there, sign up (it's free, and I've never received an email from them), and create a new station with one of those bands as the starting band.  From there, thumb up the songs you like and thumb down the songs that you don't.  After an hour or so of listening to your station and training it, you should be getting a nice stream of songs by artists similar to those that you are looking for.  As a bonus, you get to listen to some great music while you're at it.|`|znp0vztUaa	For pop I like:  I don't think about it by Emily Osment,Chemicals React by Aly & Aj,  Nobody's Perfect, and Who said by Hannah Montana.

qJTInlSeaa	I loved it and was pretty pissed off that HBO has cancelled such a good program.  They keep crappy shows on but it is always the ones I love that get the boot.....    Although they show reruns of Rome, It is not good enough to me.....    To tell you how pissed I was, I cancelled my HBO subscription and will not pay for crap service again!!!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I loved that show!    HBO had decided fairly early on that they would not go beyond 2 seasons.  The production of the show was the most expensive in TV series history.  Although there was a wealth of story for them to continue, the costs were staggering and the production was elaborate which is why they opted to just tell that small portion of Roman history.|`|W0AK2Lumaa	YEah that was good series...  HBO had it going on before this recession hit us hard...  HBO had too scale back on the series due to money simply put...  Sad  Showtime has some good shows though like Dexter.  The L word.

9vOBtO1Oaa	No other Kat, than that deliciously manly, Samuel L Jackson, especially if he's wearing a kilt! Has great legs and IS sexiness personified.

And thirdly if the other 2 are not possible, either Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro,    or that still gorgeous hunk of a real man : Sean Connery! (in that order of preference!)

lKfqFPGUaa	Good answer.  I wouldn't have thought about it being there myself.  But I also think it's not there anymore.  I think both the island and the survivors flashing through time are moving through time and space.  For the flashing to stop, everyone that wasn't supposed to leave the island must return to restore its balance.  Or as Ms. Hawking says "God help us all"|`|GBKaftrJaa	My history knowledge is pretty bad along with my geography being poorest.  But when that older woman was figuring out that they had 70 hours to go back, when there would be a window when she knew where the island would be, those lines that were tracing on the computer all pointed to in between South America and Africa in the middle of the Atlantic.

May I suggest you listen to some Joan Osborne, K.D. Lang, and Norah Jones...etc?         You need a bit of grit in there.  You're very expressive and animated when you sing, which is good, but I didn't quite find it believable.  I didn't believe that you had actually ever met anyone by the name of "Taylor."  You have to make the listener believe that you're singing from the heart...that this latte boy experience actually happened to you.         Hope I didn't bring you down...you have an incredible voice, so keep at it|`|jIS4DkNvaa	wow your reallly good!!!

I follow this simple rule for finances and windfalls : 50 / 25 / 25    Take 50% of the money and pay off a bill you already have.    Take 25% of the money and save it for something in the future.    Take 25% of the money and just blow it. Buy something you don't need, take a vacation, give it away, whatever!    This allows you to do three things.  Pay off bills, save for the future, and still enjoy the immediate rush of extra money.  Do this for pay raises, tax refunds, anything really.    It's worked quite well for me!|`|52uOJ4D5aa	Take me and my hubby to Mexico for two weeks.

mCWy2VBGaa	There are a few reasons for this, that I can see.  First is the target audience for anime and manga:  the teen set, for the most part.  They want to identify with the main characters.    Secondly, the early to mid teens are usually the time of life when interpersonal/intergender relationships start changing from a childlike/innocent to a more sexually charged type.  So romantic possibilities sell stories.    Thirdly, in what I think of as the Wesley Crusher phenomenon (see Star Trek: The Next Generation), when a teenager is able to work hard and save the day, that really appeals to the idealistic streak in the audience.  Prime example here is Naruto - the underdog who has trained hard, has a noble goal (rescue/recover/restore Sasuke), and as of the most recent chapters, is taking on a major enemy largely single-handed.  I personally expect him to win but with a believable level of heavy damage.  Can't let it get TOO idealistic, after all...    In short, mangaka write what sells.  Many of the stories that have captured popular attention, particularly in Western markets, happen to have the same kind of appeal that we have generated with characters like the original Teen Titans.|`|OIk5G79Raa	The U.S. does the same thing . Look at everything from Scooby Doo to the mighty Morphing Power Rangers . It's all about appealing to a young demographic .|`|6rR7LTl1aa	In Japan, youth is strongly idealized, particularly with adulthood being the soulcrushing endeavor it often turns out to be.    This, coupled with the sensibility of targetting an adolescent/young-adult demographic (they have fewer responsibilities, more spare time, and more spending money), results in a very strong tendency for that age group to feature prominently in these media.|`|elY5vkVyaa	I agree with Otaku and I think anim and manga wouldn't be as much fun if the characters were all older. If I could choose to be any age forever I would never want to be older than 18 because your body and mind go downhill after that. The best way I can sum it up is "youth is fun".|`|SN7YHJTbaa	I know, its kinda annoying. and why are all the girls big-boobed and allthe boys are feminine?|`|ooiGTD1Uaa	i think its because that kind of manga is supposed to appeal to teenagers more so it make sense to use characters of that age.|`|2b0f81fb7bceab4ca7447b2b2061c7dbaa	It's because they're young, so able to do all of those extreme things.  Also, it appeals to the masses

27jdKozNaa	You hit the nail on the head  Sometimes I ask really Serious questions hoping someone will take the time to read & answer it intelligently, Instead I get maybe just one answer, usually a link leading me to some  site trying to sell me used condoms or something stupid like that.   If I ask what color was your poop last night Im sure I would get a gazzilion answers though|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	The simplest there are to answer. The ones which require very little or basic brain power. The ones you've mentioned are as well very often commonly used to the point of becoming not just stupid but boring.  Good, courageous question, by the way...|`|1TPGdaXJaa	You're right, I get one well thought out answer for every 20 pointless answers on here.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Yes, I totally agree! That's awesome!|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I think question 2 would definitly have the most answers.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	You figured it out, the dumber you appear the more popular you will be...|`|SNf7Qqswaa	whats the question again?  oh its one of those monkey puzzle things right? you should have had a number 4 (all of the above)|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Ask what time it is|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Sex Question-to be honest|`|Ga11Abmzaa	number 2|`|kg6H6HDuaa	The race question first people voice their opinion faster on those  Then the sex question  What is twilight?|`|YdXhZka8aa	Mostly people like stupid questions so they can post a random answer with out having to think that much (that's what I like anyway) ask them 'Where's Waldo?'|`|0CET3S3daa	You are right about the type of questions getting the most answers here.   Do i stink?   Ask me anything about sex, lol|`|4E2FYEHsaa	Ones asked by official celebrity accounts.|`|zdfZzpE1aa	2|`|agHeuZ2saa	the first one    you will probabaly get banned with the others lol|`|i983Dk2Maa	huh?|`|4aafde79241dffae386885317d01c20eaa	iv noticed sex related questions get the biggest response, or those that can be easily twisted to be sex related, or just quick and easy to answer, nothing that involves thinking basically!|`|VA3tGarQaa	Ask where someone is from,  .  Ask what their favourite colour is.    Ask what time it is where you are.|`|QnnmJEuraa	lmao....hahahaha.  This is hysterical and true. Kudos to you...|`|PYUVHnfMaa	I haven't any seen any like the second but the other 2 I have seen a lot of.|`|fDQ163B5aa	I can relate.    One, two & three -- not exactly 'cause they're interesting, but these questions attract too many people. Plus the "Am I Pretty?" one.|`|y3Yu3DCDaa	Haha! I know, i never know what to ask to get lots of answers. Usually dumb, really easy questions that someone with half-a-brain can answer attracts lots of people i noticed (including me!)    umm...sex questions seem to get lots of attention too.    Oh, and 'When is ur bday' 'Which country are you from' 'What time is it now at the place u are' are good questions that get lots of answers (so many i never read the whole thing!)|`|GRa8dmx7aa	you're probably right.  or, just ask questions that appear to exclude others from answering (i.e. "Girls only, please ", etc.)|`|qiyLq6CRaa	2 or  3     2 you would get alot of **** for asking questions like that.     3 you would get all the horny people's attention.|`|BPckjS68aa	A question about a question will probably do you in. Much like this question youve just asked|`|haN6FsyJaa	ahaha, well, you could ask "What question do you think would get the most answers?"   lol.     Well. Truthfully...  I'm not too sure. I think in P&S to get the most answers it would have to be random and or short and easy to answer. Or it would have to have something to do with a fad that's VERY popular. Especially things like Twilight.     I think thing's like racial issues and fad's (Jonas Brothers & Twilight etc.) would get heaps of answers because everyone want's to put their opinion in. Whether they like it or not.     The same thing has happened to me. Sometimes you have a really good question but it get's over looked and instead people answer smaller common questions.    Well that's the way I see it. But what do I know.    ^_______^         Jazmine.?

Why would they? They just get the movies that are coming out world wide and give it to you.

But no, i worked at Blockbuster for over a year and i can tell you without a doubt that they nor Netflix does that.

They could have at least sent him to the B&B so those Logan gals could get something else to chew on!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I love it when they do the flashbacks.  It was great to see them.

Sometimes they do when they get older though.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Yes I agree it made me smile b/c I remember what they looked like back then b/c my mom has been watchin the show since it first aired in the 70's but I was just a little girl so watching those old scenes was pretty cool...|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	yes they were completely sad, i am so sad that Brad is leaving too!|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Awww, I can't wait to watch it!

GAY  7. hilarious!!!  8. i love Will Ferrel..so yes  9. it's okay..not as good as one  10. Good movie all in all, but there is too much computerized graphics to be a real Indie flick|`|AA10021093	1/2/4/6/  have never heard of these    3/10  good, 10 could have been better if they had not been so damn cheap with the special effects    5 sucked bad  7 sucked even worst    8 depends on your mindset of humor    9 never seen|`|1e81375599e40c59530649016c9e229aaa	Wanted is ace, it's really action-packed. I've never seen Traitor. I'd watch Dark Knight just for Heath Ledger as the Joker, he's so absorbed and wonderfully insane as him, but the rest of the films brill too. Haven't seen the next three, but I'd say avoid that Disaster Movie. It's in the same vein as Epic Movie, and that was just way too...well it was just bad. Tropic Thunder is really funny, and its got a good and unpredictable plot for a comedy. Robert Downey Jr. is ace as the actor who has turned his skin black for the role, because he's so engrossed in it. Haven't seen Stepbrothers, but Iike Will Ferrell, he's usually good. Mummy 2 is good, it's action-packed, and the little bits of comedy along the way are always good, I'd recommend number 3 as well. As for Indiana Jones, I think the main reason to watch it would be because it's Indiana Jones. It is a bit predictable, but hey, it's still part of a classic franchise, so its worth watching. Hope I helped.|`|AA11875616	1. Wanted -- ?  2. Traitor -- No, plot too confusing.  3. Dark Knight -- YES!  4. Body Of Lies -- ?  5. Eagle Eye -- ?  6. Disaster Movie -- ?  7. Tropic Thunder -- ?  8. Stepbrothers -- ?  9. Mummy 2 -- Yes.  10. Indiana Jones (Last One) -- Yes!|`|3SwJy3B7aa	Yea maybe not  6 unless you need something to fall asleep to|`|icNbtnpKaa	Traitor is excellent, Dark Knight is good, Mummy 2 is very good and so is the Indian Jones movie.  The rest I have not seen.|`|vhv5uf5haa	1 - Must!  2 - Yeah  3 - Definitely!  4 - Yep  5 - Nah  6 - Wouldn't Personally  7 - Yes, Please Do!  8 - Nope  9 - If you like that sort of thing, i don't  10 - NOOO!|`|3ZourwBLaa	I LOVED Eagle Eye!! The others I have not seen. But Eagle Eye is a very good thriller!!|`|15ec817d4e23b9fd928120ba805bff04aa	yes some are gd!eagle eye is gd.|`|e9LR7X2paa	I've only seen 5 of the 10 movies those five i'll give you my opinion on weather or not they are worth watching... the Dark knight-   3 -U have to watch the movie. Keith Ledger is the joker and it was his last movie before he died and its the best performance from an actor that i've ever seen.. as for tropic thunder - its an okay movie  as for step brothers you will laugh so much that your sides will hurt.  Mummy 2 is an okay movie i've seen better.  Indiana Jones - you have got to see|`|CcmAdX8Baa	wanted 7.5  traitor 8.5  dark knight 10  body of lies 8.0  eagle eye 7.0  disaster movie 5.5  tropic thunder 9.0  stepbrothers 7.5  mummy 2 7.0  indiana jones 8.0|`|ynSoYHjLaa	yes to all except 6, 10, and 8. also, a side note, be sure to watch taken, its freaking awesome|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	1.  is good id give it 8/10  2. never seen it but it looks good  3.

Lk4aCBACaa	You really need to compare your full birth chart with the full birth charts of each of these two. First and foremost, you need to look at each chart on its own to see what each person wants and needs out of a relationship. Only then can you compare the charts and see which aspects will best contribute to both person's relationship wants and needs.    Another note of caution: astrological synastry's (relationship analysis) strong point is its ability to identify the relationship needs of each person, and the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship itself. It *cannot* tell you which one is "meant to be" or which one will be the most successful. You still have free will. I've seen great synastry produce awful relationships and bad synastry produce great ones: it all depends on how you use what you have between you and how hard you're willing to work to keep the relationship going. Astrology should never be the only decision-maker for your relationships.

Everything's distant and I don't know what to believe.  It's so hard, lost in the world confusion.  And I need to leave, for a while.  Life is so meaningless, there is nothing worth a smile.  So goodbye, I'll miss you.    And I'm sorry, but this is my fate.  Everything is worthless, no one who wants me to stay.  And I'm sorry, but I've waited too long.  So here's my goodbye, no one will cry over me.  I'm not worth any tears.    It's been the years, of abuse.  Neglected to treat the dissorder,  That controls my youth, for so long.  I'm in a fleshy tomb, burried up above the ground.  It's no use, why should I hold on?  It's been five years, don't need one more.  So goodbye, life's abuse.    And I'm sorry, but this is my fate.  Everything is worthless, no one who wants me to stay.  And I'm sorry, but I've waited too long.  So here's my goodbye, no one will cry over me.  I'm not worth any tears.    And I'm sorry, but this my fate.  Everything is worthless, no one who wants me to stay.  And I'm sorry, but I've waited too long.  So here's my goodbye, no one will cry over me.  So here's my goodbye, no one will cry over me.  I'm not worth any tears.|`|3D1w7eCjaa	the artist is And Then I Turned Seven    it's called "Goodbye (I'm Sorry)"

I wouldn't mind if a guy took me there on a date, but I know other girls who would hate it.    Find out what your date's interests are.|`|JnElq85taa	The zoo is a great place for a date!  My boyfriend and I have gone to several zoos together.  We both love animals.  The zoo is a great place for animal lovers to go on a date -- it provides lots of conversation (talking about the animals) so it makes the first dates less awkward.  However, you don't have to talk ALL the time, because you'll be looking at the animals.  You can picnic together and take a stroll and hold hands.  My boyfriend and I also found a couple of private areas to make out at the zoo.  (I know that may sound trashy, but it's fun if you're not being public about it -- it's our little secret!)    The bottom line -- the zoo is a fantastic place for a date.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Our zoo is one of the best in the nation, so if you were taking them to ours then I'd say no.

The best are:     The Sixth Sense   Unbreakable   Signs       The others....well, not very good at all but since you liked THAT one you will probably like these too:     The Village   The Happening       If you really did like that film you should check out his BETTER work, at one time he was an amazing film maker.|`|9STSmCnxaa	Try any movie by the director, M.

PRg9UgOlaa	YES!! I do not understand why ANY person would want 18 children. But, hey, to each his own right? They creep me out too and just thinking of her "situation" down there after 18 kids, THAT makes my skin crawl.|`|hkQSqPEwaa	Not really.  Every family is different.|`|bnf7CDtxaa	I don't think they even realize that they've started their own cult..............|`|opaMeWyIaa	They don't creep me out.. They're quite funny actually.    = ]|`|AA11777868	They are a bit strange but seem to love each other. However, children are nothing but work and time and patience and why they want so many children is their business. They will probably be able to start their own country or cult with all the children they keep having. They will probably have 10 more kids in the next ten years if they can. They are a loving but very strange family!|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I just watched the episode where the oldest son got married. They said no one was allowed to dance at the wedding because when girls dance, it makes boys lust after them. What the hell!?   Any family who allows little interaction between the outside world and their kids are definitely weird.   And the fact that they are raising their girls to do nothing more than be baby breeders is sick. They're setting women back 80 years.|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	They are freaky!!!   I just want to tell that woman to get it "stitched" up, you don't have to have that many kids.  They are somehow mentally ill, or needy.|`|36403b8f2fb997d330a0acc41e0b0800aa	They use to but not so much anymore. And for some odd reason, I use to love Jon & Kate plus 8, but they are the ones getting under my skin lately. It's a good thing that I don't really care to watch them anymore.|`|VxN6DJ54aa	Yeah they make my family feel small and I grew up with  5 brothers and sisters plus their names all start with the same later.  Gees.|`|e5g48gKvaa	OMG YYYYESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL CRAZY!!|`|mansoJamaa	yesss!!  the mom seems fake to me. it grosses me out that once she pops out a baby she's like okay let's pop out another one.  I think they are trying to compete against other HUGE families. WHY?!?!!|`|Ukgl64pSaa	They have nothing else to do apparently but make babies.|`|dt5oSNQ5aa	I like them and I love what they do and why they do it. They are great parents and know how to raise a big family. They are not weird, they are just well raised.  Its weird to us because were not used to seeing so much well behaved children. I love their names and I think it's cool they all start with J. People can learn a lot from them, especially those who can not control their wild kids.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	you actually watch that crap?|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	no i loove that show. its awsome to see the way they deal with things when they have 18 kids.|`|oP8krEBiaa	oh yeah they creep me out too. theyre like amish or something lmao idk they remind me of a cult. but yeah they creep me out, how do they keep all those kids busy? and not let them watch t.v. ahh theyre weird...|`|tbeO3Lataa	YES! They scare the sh*t out of me!    Okay, first of all, WHO HAS 18 KIDS!    Secondly, did you know they did not even let their son KISS his wife until the wedding day?    They are like a creepy baby-breeding cult. I have two words for that family. Birth control.|`|27jdKozNaa	Hahahaha like theyre building a baby making cult or something hahahahaha
WlEOO8Luaa	Captain America would be good - with either Neal McDonough or Mark Valley as Rogers    Thor might be cool. Wouldn't have to necessarily be Marvel-based.    Thunderbolts could be a good idea. A group of super-heroes that turn out to be evil.    Deadpool would be freakin' awesome. Ryan Reynolds made a good choice for the upcoming Wolverine movie.|`|0UpFkX5oaa	I WANT TO SEE A PROPER MOVIE ON THE DARK PHOENIX SAGA.  But I know that's unlikely now :(|`|FDt7cC8haa	Doctor Strange|`|AA11314600	None.  I am sick of all the super hero movies.  Between those, the remakes, and the crappy sequels it has become clear that Hollywood has completely run out of ideas and the only motivation to make movies anymore is a quick buck|`|GKH8n3xzaa	Wonder Woman!!|`|OpHex5QKaa	silver surfer|`|WiTBXCYvaa	Spawn & Anit-Spawn. I also agree with the comment, Wonder Woman. That would be a good one.

rnqgiRkWaa	The Aries Moon is an unstable and uncomfortable Moon, since Aries is a Fire Sign and the Moon rules Cancer, a Water Sign. This is a gregarious, generous and optimistic Moon, where opinions are decisive and forceful. The Aries Moon is also a high-strung and controlling Moon, as well as being spontaneous, energetic, friendly and honest. It suggests an aggressive attitude, quick temper, impulsiveness and brutally forthright behavior...the tendency to act through emotion rather than reason. The attitude of the Aries Moon is restless and risk-taking.    In general, those with the Moon in Aries are likely to be spontaneous and excitable. Such individuals are also militantly hostile in their expression of anger and maybe be prone to periods of irritability. These are self-reliant characters who want to have everything their own way, refusing to be pushed around by anybody. Those with the Moon in Aries are self-disciplined and balk against any who would impose discipline upon them. These characters are usually either intensely liked or disliked by others due to their impulsive behavior. Moon in Aries individuals like to take charge and will probably rise to positions of authority in their chosen careers. Being natural leaders, they set the pace and terms for themselves and will likely chose their own vocations, regardless of any advice offered by friends and relatives. The relationship between an individual born with the Moon in Aries and his or her parents may be a difficult one since there is a distinct lack of both sympathy and communication. The actions of these individuals are perceived by others to be impulsive and unexpected. The Moon in Aries is a good sign for those who enjoy originality, adventure, independence and a military life. Such persons may be attracted to studies in the occult or mysticism and possess a great desire to harbor secrets. Impatient, with the need to act immediately and consider the consequences at a later date, those with the Moon in Aries find it difficult to understand opposing viewpoints. These are quick-thinking characters with a love of the instantaneous and a tendecy to become bored with minor practical details. Straight-forward in nature, the Moon in Aries person is very much a "what you see in what you get" type of individual with a wonderfully warm heart most of the time and a desire to comfort those in need of solace.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Where's Mars and Mercury for each of you? Mars for how you each react to and express your own anger, Mercury for how you communicate with each other.|`|L00xbCERaa	yeah i agree with what she said.......

6qDhXpWfaa	I agree with you completely! Reading the first half was great, yeah they god married, they had the honeymoon, bella finally had great sex, etc, etc.. That was expected and good. But then she gets pregnant which is weird, then gives birth which was gory and disturbing, and then they get to the action sequence, which was boring. Ugh.     I was expecting something suprizing to happen to, I mean you read about who's fighting, how tense it is and just when the battle's about to start, it's over. That's lame. It's like meyer was writing the battle scene and then thought: I'm tired of this, let's just throw alice in and put some clues in the first parts of the book and get it done with.     I agree about the ending too. It seemed so unrealistic--even though it is a vampire book. It was so "happily ever after" and "nothing bad will happen to edward and bella ever again".     End of long rant, lol.     Oh and no, there isn't going to be a 5th book, at least for Bella and Edward--with how happy they are, what is she going to write about? I think if she ever wrote more about vampire, It would centre on Renesme and Jacob and plus that other dude from the amazon (forgot his name).|`|zKYybuu7aa	The ending was disappointing. Bella was finally capable of standing up for herself for ONCE in her life and what happens??? She gets a barrior power that makes it so even if there was a battle, she'd be more useful staying still. Also, there was no battle!!! TT~TT Where's the action in these books! Book three and two had something i think!  Well, whatever. Bella gave up her entire life, friends and family for Edward! Ew!|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I have to agree with you on the ending. I just didn't find it as good as the other three. But at the same time, I'm so happy Bella and Edward are happily ever after.|`|mt38EXp7aa	No I loved the ending, great ending to the series!!!But obviously I just wanted a happy ending!!    I don't think so apart from Midnight sun! it would ruin it if there was!!|`|ChAfYokSaa	I completely agree! I love that it had a happy ending, not so excited that they have a little kid for the rest of eternity.     I was really looking forward to the big battle scene, or at least something to do with the fake i.d's! I think since a lot of the 'battle' happened in thier minds that it was pretty boring and I'm really excited to see what happens when it comes time to film that movie.    Also I dont think the one from Edward's point of view is coming out anymore, after the story got leaked online Stephenie Meyer said "I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely."   :'[

Check the MPAA website.   Look up Samuel Goldwyn Films and Sherwood Pictures, the distributors, and contact them. Odds are, considering the nature of the film and who made it, they will grant permission for your church to show it.

B2SMfqFNaa	This is from Ron White and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.  He has a stand-up act with this in it.he says it like 20 times.|`|3BLnUnnQaa	hello,    it's possible he's referring to a stand up comedian, Ron White.  One of his shows was called "They Call me "Tater Salad" "  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431370/    I suppose the line itself comes from that show.    Mike Dennis.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Ron White of the Blue Collar comedy tour fame.   They call me tater salad is one of his bits.|`|bI4jWPcsaa	it is from a comedy routine by Ron White (blue collar comedy tour)|`|UADLdXBtaa	Its from the part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour when Ron White (nicknamed "Tater") was doing a bit about his Bull Dog. He said that he likes to mess with his dog by sticking m&m's and stuff in the dog's lips while he's sleeping so when he wakes up and is pleasantly surprised, Ron imagines the dog to be saying to him, "It's gonna be a good day, Tater." It's pretty funny.     The Tater Salad thing is from when he was a teenager and he was arrested for the first time and the cops asked him if he had any aliases. He thought it was a stupid question so he said, "Yeah, they call me Tater Salad," to be funny. Years later when he was arrested for something little again they said "are you Ron White, aka Tater Salad?" It's funny that the first cop even took him seriously and wrote it down. Now everyone just calls him Tater.
e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I think waaaaaaaaay too much. It's hard for me to shut my brain up, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep. Sometimes I'm thinking about the future and well I'll be in it, other times I'm thinking about any recent drama, the rest of the time I'm thinking about some of the most random ish you could imagine. Like how trees are the huge giants of the plant world or how the night seems like it can almost grab you and suck you in. Yeah, really weird thoughts. Whatever the topic though, I'm always thinking about something. This isn't just an Aquarius trait though. It's an air sign thing in general.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Yup I Think Alot|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	i'm a sponge, i always watch shows where i learn something: this old house, two guy garage, good eats, discovery channel, PBS, history channel, myth busters, jim crammer, ...|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	I t-h-i-n-k the whole astrology thing is a load of cobblers B-U-T have to admit as a fellow Aquarian I love love water in any form (particularly er..liquid) - the sight, smell, sound, sensation, taste, fluidity, power......    When I pop off just want to be chucked off the end of the pier.|`|fXUlPjSIaa	I never stop thinking. Ever! I am one too. I'm glad another Aquarius is like that though. It is so weird.

So there is your answer from me. :'D|`|ZvFamJM8aa	I think a lot mostly when im going to sleep, I lay in bed for hours thinking of the future the past almost everything.    Oh and Im an aquarian 2 :)|`|6gtL06IZaa	i contemplate so much my mind is so overloaded with thoughts that my mind actually feels heavy!|`|oOqSpBmbaa	Yeah I think like a freakin physo!

I bet there are some that do and some that don't.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	I am Aquarius, and I Think A Lot.I think before saying anything, before I do something, and about friends and family.

I have a Sagittarius sun, Aquarius rising.
554ec5c5b3373b085112faba070414eeaa	"The Wondrous Boat Ride"  Lyrics:  Round the world and home again  That's the sailor's way  Faster faster, faster faster    There's no earthly way of knowing  Which direction we are going  There's no knowing where we're rowing  Or which way the river's flowing    Is it raining, is it snowing  Is a hurricane a-blowing    Not a speck of light is showing  So the danger must be growing  Are the fires of Hell a-glowing  Is the grisly reaper mowing    Yes, the danger must be growing  For the rowers keep on rowing  And they're certainly not showing  Any signs that they are slowing|`|hp5x7WC9aa	It's also the only song from the original movie that is actually in the book.

bnXhtB5baa	Sorry haven't seen it!!      x|`|blzFIxcUaa	No.|`|DtnLVG6Taa	If you remember at the start of the movie the reason Bernadette was sent to the Magdalene Sisters laundry was because she was flirting with the boys during school. The nuns saw her hair as a sign of vanity and a cause for lust  (both mortal sins in the catholic religion).They punished her by sending her to that awful place.      The reason she toke her hair out in front of the nuns was like a sort of rebellion. She *SPOILER* escaped from the laundry and away from the churches way-ward opinions. She wanted to , putting it crudely, flaunt her stuff ! in front of the church(represented by the nuns on the bus)    That said, what did you think of the movie, I tought it was frighting how much control the church had.

3AVHxNNTaa	this sounds depressing. two guys fighting to the death over a girl doesn't exactly fit with a supermarket in my opinion, but if you want a confusing incoherent story go ahead. If you really want to make a Cain/Abel story, work with that dynamic first instead of common manga tropes, since they really don't mix that well.     Or you could have cain be the manager XD|`|IDTQwgBaaa	Ok so This girl (let's call her Rachel) has to work to pay whatever she broke in Kane's shop (people wouldn't like it if you use the name Cain), now let's say that Abel notices her and it's love on first sight so Abel offers his help in Kane's shop to be close to Rachel.    Kane wants Rachel too but his love is really lust for the girl, Kane is like a dominant Master he makes her climb a ladder to stock some boxes on a high shelf just to see under her skirt, he gives her a hard time whenever he catches her talking to Abel, Abel on the contrary is nice to her and they secretly fall in love with each other.    Rachel arrived late to work one day for being hanging around with Abel and that night Kane forces her to sleep in a pantry or a tool shed, Kane had repeatedly told Rachel that her due will be forgiven if she agree to give kane her virginity but she refuses; As the time goes on the due is almost paid and Kane decides to take Rachel's virginity forcefully, but he finds her and his brother in action that's when he draws his knife or gun and kills Abel.    A good turning point in the story could be that Abel didn't die and comes against Kane for revange.

a1pmr73vaa	have heard that said about the movie Audition, but.. I don't see the big deal.. I own the movie and have watched it like 6 times.. it's not that violent or disturbing..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuVXe6gRI...  Ringu US: The Ring; Dir. Hideo Nakata, 1998-After the death of her cousin Tomoko, reporter Reiko hears stories of a videotape that kills everyone who sees it exactly one week after viewing. At first she discounts the rumors, but when she learns that Tomokos friend (who watched the video with her) died at exactly the same time, she begins to investigate. After viewing the tape herself, strange things start happening, and so she teams up with her ex-husband, Ryuji, to try to stop the death clock that has once again begun ticking. Reiko and Ryuji race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken volcanic island and a very strange little girl named Sadako.            The Suicide Manual (Japanese) 2003   The Suicide Song  Apartment 1303   In Chinese and Japanese literature and films, the well is a symbolic link to the underworld and by extension, the unconscious.  In folklore and in films and books such as The Ring, the well is a place of death and return.  Many commit suicide by jumping in a well and consequently the well is haunted.  This parallels Western literature.    One example comes from the Liaozhai, The Man Who Was Thrown Down a Well.  Mr. Tai gets a Christmas Carol warning from the shade of his dead cousin.  A neighbor, suspicious of a his attentions to his wife, knocks him down a well where he meets with spirits who beseech him to rebury their neglected bones.  This he promise to do and he is released back to the mundane world, a better man.    Yeogo goedam (1998)|`|f5NFa55Laa	UHMMM .....  I think that I answered this question some time last week.

He decides to use it to rid the world of criminals and rule as a God.  But then he meets a detective who's also a genius and wants to catch him.    2.) Ouran High School Host Club: Haruhi Fujioka is a middle class girl who attends a high school for the filthy rich.  After breaking a vase, she has to join a club of handsome boys and work with them and pretend to be a boy.    3.) AKIRA: A biker named Tetsuo gets taken by scientists to a lab and experimented on.  He gains psychic powers but slowly goes insane and eventually becomes a mutant.  (This might not count since it's an anime movie.)    4.) Doraemon: Nobita is a lazy little boy who grows up to be a total loser.  To prevent this from happening, his grandson sends an earless cat-like robot named Doraemon back in time to change the future for the better.  So little Nobita and Doraemon have all sorts of silly adventures with inventions from the future (like animal cookies that actually turn you into animals).  (Actually I didn't watch the anime, just read some of the manga.)    5.) Tenchi Universe: Tenchi Masaki ends up meeting 6 pretty alien girls (4 of which start living with him).  One is a space pirate, two are princesses, one's a mad scientist, and two are Galaxy police officers.  They end up framed for a crime and have to travel through space to clear their name.

Chrno Crusade: Chrono Crusade is set in the height of the Roaring Twenties, where jazz is king, bootleg liquor flows freely, and the mob rules the streets. It is a time of prosperity, luxury and decadence, and the division between rich and poor grows even wider in the wake of the First World War. It is at such times of great change and upheaval that the dark things that lurk below the world of man can come to the surface. In the world of Chrono Crusade, a fictional organization known as the Order of Magdalene (or more specifically, the characters of Sister Rosette Christopher and her soul-bound demon partner, Chrono) exists to fight the demonic threats that appear with increasing regularity across America. Both Rosette and Chrono are revealed during the course of the story to be driven by a shadowy past, centered around a search for Rosette's lost brother, Joshua. Joshua is shown to have been taken from her by the sinner, Aion, a devil who shares a dark and bloody history with Chrono, and seeks nothing less than to overthrow Heaven and Earth.      Pretear: A high school girl named Himeno Awayuki is attempted to adjust to her new life after her widowed father remarries wealthy divorcee Natsue.

When she does, the flower is healed but Himeno collapses. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by the seven Leafe Knights, Hayate, Sasame, Goh, Kei, Mannen, Hajime, and Shin. They tell her that the red snow that has been falling on the town recently is being caused by the Princess of Disaster who is awakening, and that she is using demon larva to absorb Leafe, the essence of all life. They ask Himeno to become the Prtear and help them protect the world. Himeno is initially reluctant, believing they are part of a cult or trying to play a trick on her. When a larva attacks the city and begins stealing leafe, including from her friend Yayoi, Himeno agrees to help. Hayate tells her to take her hand and she merges with him to become the Prtear of the wind. After adjusting to her new powers, Himeno is able to defeat the larva.      Full Moon wo Sagashite: 12-year-old Mitsuki Koyama is a talented singer who dreams of becoming a pop idol, but she is afflicted with sarcoma, which is curable only through a surgery that could cost her vocal cords and her ability to sing. The tumor in her throat also affects her ability to breathe well and sing loudly. On top of that, her grandmother hates music, and is completely opposed to Mitsuki's wish to audition. Her dreams seem impossible to achieve, until one day she is visited by two shinigami whom only she can see. Without knowing Mitsuki can see and hear them, they discuss how she only has one year left to live.    Realizing she cannot wait any longer to fulfill her dream, she runs away from her house and the shinigami to try to audition for a singing competition. However, the shinigami catch her before she is able to audition. Mitsuki moves one of the shinigami, Takuto, to make a deal with herif she goes quietly when her one year is up, he will help her become a singer so that she may leave the world without any regrets. He gives her the ability to transform into a healthy 16-year-old self who is not encumbered by a throat tumor. Though there is much competition, she is able to win over the judges with her enthusiasm for singing and her excellent voice. To conceal her true identity, she chooses the stage name Fullmoon.    Mitsuki decided to become a singer two years before the shinigami's arrival, when she was 10 years old. She made a promise with Eichi Sakurai, a 16-year-old boy she met in her orphanage, that the next time they met, they would both be closer to their dreams. Eichi wanted to become an astronomer and Mitsuki wanted to become a singer. Shortly after, Eichi was adopted and emigrated to America before Mitsuki could express her feelings for him. Mitsuki hopes that by becoming a famous idol, Eichi will be able to hear her sing and realize her feelings for him.

Since most Indians are Hindu, they mostly look upon more peaceful subjects. Friday the 13th is a horror movie, and they would see that as unholy; most would perceive it as disrespectful to the Higher Creator, since He/They/She only "created" normal, holy creatures. That being said, I think you could see why horror movies and other movies containing nudity, gore, and adult language are usually not released in India, and other countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, etc. Does that answer your question?

First contact the releasers of the album.  OF course these kinds of records don't make a lot of money so you shouldn't expect to get rich off it.  At the very least reestablish the fact that you wrote the song - reprinting the sleave would of course be incredibly expensive for them and I wouldn't expect that - maybe they could mention it in their website or something, and give you a nice mention and what you are doing these days.  See if you can work something out with them - if nobody's been knocking on your door for songs lately I would see it as an opportunity, not a problem!  Maybe you can do a tour with other artists in support of the record!  Good luck.  I would send them a letter saying what I said plus a copy of proof you wrote it - don't call them or they will go into panic mode. This will give them time to research their options and give you a reply.

However, last night there was a wrap party in london for the crew and only a handful of the housemates turned up.
lKfqFPGUaa	Charles was a leader of the Others or was going to be from when we saw him on the island.  I don't know that he is the immediate preceding leader before Ben Linus, but it would seem so seeing the grudge between the two.  I believe Widmore had moved the island before, like Ben Linus says, once someone moves the island, the person that moved it can never return.  But that doesn't mean they won't try.  Widmore has been trying for years.  I think Ben has the same agenda, but the island has the say in who stays and who goes.  I think Ben believes he can go back as long as those that left the island and weren't supposed to leave, go with him.  Or it could all be one big conspiracy by the master conspirator Ben Linus to bring the Oceanic 6 back unwillingly, kill his successor John Locke, kill his predecessor Widmore, and ultimately take the thrown for himself and keep the island his secret forever.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	That is a good question.  I wonder how he got the island as he claims Ben stole it from him.|`|8cXAf7lCaa	That is why he is so obsessed with the island; he must have some sort of a grudge...-|`|448ae9fe57ebcdd3c132783ccffaaf61aa	Mr Widmore was obviously originally one of "The Others".

My theory is CW did something awful which led to him being banished, and he's been trying to find a way to return to the Island.|`|Pzah4HCwaa	My Theory is that while he was one of the others He thought that he should be the leader, leading to him being banished from the island by whoever Richard answers to. If you notice CW has a problem with taking orders from Richard.
vgNELAQIaa	Cocky has 3 meanings in Australia    Cocky = short term for cockatoo    Cocky = rancher, as in cow cocky       The term you refer to is subject to multiple meanings, subject to the way in which it is used, but means pretty much the same thing.    "I am feeling cocky tonight" = means to be feeling in high spirits, outspoken, and feeling ten foot tall and bullet proof.    "Don't get cocky with me" = don't pick a fight, don't be a smart mouth, don't act as if you are superior.    "Why are you getting all cocky" = the person has an attitude towards arguing and perhaps aggressive.    "You cocky (insert expletive) = this would tend to mean the person on the receiving end is about to get whacked for having an attitude of superiority.|`|AA12380746	Or a male chicken....     yeah, that's what they mean...|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, rooster....|`|cYRZpGkqaa	no|`|Yg2iIneKaa	no they mean you think your all that.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	or penisy lol|`|L4Ky6SCqaa	Not quite|`|qxHwSQTHaa	no....|`|frjSBxzBaa	to some degree but hell when you are as confident as I am what else can you be|`|SWJMjvLqaa	they are saying you are full of yourself or conceited|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	not really. cocky has different meanings  when someone says "your so cocky"  it means that your so concidend. like your so into your self.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Oh sorry.

AA11402617	I am not 100% sure about this but the DVDs contain different episodes than the season list because the first season was only 6 episodes long while one of the other later seasons had 30.  The DVDs are separated differently that the broadcast list and it also depends on where you live USA or other countries. Check out this web page.  Perhaps you can figure out the whole deal. I would love to have the whole series on DVD but I don't know what I'd watch on regular TV. Good luck  .  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy_...  .

Gaines is a fun loving slacker who, unfortunately, gets turned down for every college he applied for, much to the chagrin of his overly expectant parents. So, with a little cutting and pasting, he creates the South Harmon Institute of Technology, and lo and behold, he is accepted (along with his friends Rory, Hands, and Glen, whose college plans were also all but dashed). However, his parents want to see the website, the campus, and the dean. So now he has his other friend Sherman (who has been accepted to the prestigious Harmon College) build a web page, they lease out an abandoned psychiatric hospital, and they hire Sherman's uncle Ben to be the dean. Problem solved? Not quite. The web page was done so well, that hundreds of students show up at the front door, all of which were turned down by other colleges. Faced with no choice, Bartleby decides to proceed with turning South Harmon into a real college, and sets about figuring out what to teach and how to teach it. Meanwhile at Harmon, dean Van Horne meets with Hoyt Ambrose, a rich law student and head of the KBE fraternity (which Sherman is trying to become a member of), to discuss building a gateway for Harmon using land presently being used by South Harmon. He tries finding the leaseholder of the land, to no avail. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Monica, catches him cheating on her, and a big party at South Harmon lures a chunk of Harmon's students away, including Monica into the arms of Bartleby. Now Hoyt uses Sherman, knowing he has been bouncing between the two schools, in an attempt to bring South Harmon down for good. However, Bartleby has an accreditation appointment with the state Board of Education to prove South Harmon's worthiness. Can he legally bring the South Harmon Institute of Technology to life and win the love of Monica?|`|H3lWZXQraa	Accepted|`|dcd677f8a64ccb04ca87e5bc7dde21feaa	It's called "accepted"|`|04Te5gzzaa	The name of the movie is called "Accepted".

8369VVZjaa	I could be wrong, but I think it's about a girl he's just made up. Like, she's imaginary, you know. This is how I analyze it:    "She seems dressed in all the rings" -  I think it's like, you how you cut down a tree and it has rings? Well, it's because the trunk is growing outward from the little tree that started it. I believe what this means it that this girl is the deepest thing inside of him, like his deepest, darkest secret and she makes him everything he is.    "... enter the night that she came home forever" -  I think this part means that as soon as he came up with her, that she wouldn't go away and that his mind is her 'home'.    "She's the only one that makes me sad" -  I believe he made her like a real person, that's why he gets so upset. She's so real but she isn't there, and that he's confused of what to think and do. So I think that what he is trying to say is that he feels she isn't there for him, and you know what it's like to love someone very much and them not being there for you, it's hard for him to accept.    "I'm a slave, and I am a master" -  I think what this means is that he is the master because he came up with her and control what she does, but when she's 'around' him, he's flat on his face for her. She just controls him because she's just like that, because that's the way he made her.    "She is something in me, that I despise" -   I believe he's sick of himself thinking that she'll be real when she isn't. I think that he wants to let her go but he can't because she'll only take the love and the security he has from him.     "I won't let this build up inside of me" -  This, I think, has a few meanings. One, that if he keeps on thinking that she is there and that they're in love and such that she'll just build up in his little fantasies that he may have, and everything he says and that she 'says' will build up and count against him.    "SHE ISN'T REAL! I CAN'T MAKE HER REAL!" -  This is basicly summing up and being able to tell himself that she isn't real, but he won't accept it.      Yeah, I know. Long answer. But thanks. =D. So, yeah, that's what I think about Vermilion!     P.S. The way you asked your question kinda reminds me of Yoda..lol. :D|`|cLoXF2UNaa	This song is one of my favourites! The thing with lyrics is that they are written so that people can interpret them in their own way. To me this song sounds like it is about someone falling in love with a girl they can't have, but at the end the lyrics "She isn't real, I can't make her real" are quite ambiguous. They could either mean that the girl is a figment of the imagination, or that she is completely unobtainable and therefore no matter how hard he tries, the man cannot have her, making her unreal to him.|`|qv5YTx5kaa	The differences (between the two tracks) are subtle  'Vermilion, Pt. 1' is about the enrapturing, the buildup, the anticipation and the neurosis, says Taylor. "'Part 2' is the aftermath, the pieces that have to be picked up later, and maybe the guilt of having lived through it.". Both songs are said to be about lost or unrequited love from a possibly suicidal person's perspective.

It's a challenge for me, because I'm going from being flip then, in certain moments, my vulnerability comes out. It's really hard to try to hide it. I think that Nicole wants so badly to trust somebody. She's never really, truly dealt with anything. I don't know if you're anyone who's ever had an issue in your life, but those of us who have, if you don't deal with it, at some point it's going to explode. I think she's getting to that boiling point. She's about to burst. As we all know she's got a little bit of a bad history. I think that's kind of why she's so flippant and why she can go from one place to the other She's just so busy covering now. It's just so great; I just find so many wonderful things. And in working with Ed Scott and Noel Maxam, they're so willing to listen to my ideas and really work with me and really just make, not only the show, but my character just amazing.        * Have a Good Day *               ~ Don ~

Half Empty = you are seeing things for the bad and you feel as thought you are missing something all the time, more of a negative approach.  That's the best was i can explain it, sorry x|`|TSVNzx41aa	hi!  if you say that the glass is half full, it means that you have a positive attitude towards everything.  if you say that the glass is half empty, it means that you have a negative one.  it's just a way of testing your attitude.  i always say that the glass is half full ;)  hope it helped!|`|jKvBhooNaa	it means like the different perspectives people have....for example if a person sees "the glass half full" they are a very positive person or optimistic and they like to think on the bright side of things. if a person sees "the glass half empty" they seem to be negative and they think of what worse can happen in situations rather than thinking positively.|`|03piV6uvaa	To an alcoholic the glass is always half empty.|`|7ydNIaowaa	It is a saying that refers to how people view life.    If you take a cup (250 mL) and fill it to half way (125 mL) you can either see it as half full, or half empty.    In general people tend to base their opinion on your perspective on life by whether you feel the glass is half full or half empty.    If when looking at your glass you see it as half full, people then think that you are optimistic because you feel that the glass is more full than empty. If when looking at your glass you see it as half empty, people then think that you are pessimistic because you feel that the glass is more empty than full.    You may be one of those people who have a different look on life and feel that the glass is just half way.

xTioPxaVaa	It depends on what level of band you're talking about.    Let's take a large arena act for example (Jonas Bros, Madonna, etc).  A local promoter actually fronts the money to put the show on.  In other words, someone has to be willing to risk the money.  The artist isn't going to have anything at risk...they're going to get their minimum guarantee plus a percentage of the ticket sales.  So, the local promoter secures the artist, rents the hall, does the advertising, etc.  The artist basically rolls in with their production, does the show, gets paid, and heads to the next town.  If there's any money left over after everything gets paid for, then the promoter pockets it.  If there's a lose, then he eats it.  And in this biz, you can make or lose a whole lot of money very quickly.    So, the local promoter has to be reasonably sure that he can make his money back.  Renting arenas (or even large halls) has gotten very expensive in the last 8-10 years.  That's why you see more and more bands playing the outdoor ampitheaters (or "sheds" as they're know in the business).  Those are less expensive to rent, which holds down the ticket price (and hopefully attracts more people to the show).  And unfortunately, there's a very small window of opportunity (weather wise) in your area to do these kind of shows.    For club level acts, it comes down to whether or not they can get the money they want and if the routing makes sense.  A large part of the cost of touring is transportation, so you want to keep your driving to a minimum.  If I were going to route a tour through your area, I would try to make it where the show came up through Colorado or the uppper midwest, through Washington state, and then down the west coast, and then back through Arizona, New Mexico, and back to Texas.    That's just a couple of examples of how the touring biz works.  Hope this answers your question.    Greetings from Austin, TX    Ken
3N2ElzcQaa	Not really a virus, but whenever I go to mangafox to read a manga, the internet just freezes, and I need to reboot my computer. Its annoying though, but it happened a few months ago. Just a few weeks ago, I was able to read manga on that site again.     Get your computer checked. Its the fastest thing to do if you're not sure if there's a virus in your computer or not.    Bonus Q: Which anime is funnier One Piece of Gintama? (In Your Opinion)    Oh man, hard one. I love both, and I think they're absolutely hilarious. I happen to collect Gintama.    But, I'll have to go with One Piece. Oda has a great sense of humor. Its nice to see another fan of both series.|`|3OYv4dnSaa	Hmmm........ I got a kind of threat at one time when I visit a certain page of Wikipedia.    It's certain that visiting a trustworthy site DOES NOT give virus/trojan (I mean trustworthy in terms of whether it has threats or not). Most likely, your computer spotted a threat that is already in your computer. Think of it like hide-and-seek game: it takes a while to catch a virus while your computer is constantly searching for it.    ........Or it could be a spyware with fake virus warning........?  (not likely though)    Just keep updating your anti-virus and anti-spyware and you'll be fine.    _______________________      Bonus Q- Which anime is funnier One Piece or Gintama? (In your opinion)    Not much of comedy and I have never watch One Piece or Gintama. But there are some that are funny like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Samurai Champloo.|`|dFWzf6aaaa	no but  but it could have been put there   one piece|`|cs8qISqqaa	I had the same experience, luckily My anti-virus detected it before any harm was done. but I've been trying to read a certain manga, and I get all these notices that trojans have been detected and removed from my system.

"Do you know what I did, dumn cluck that I am?  I fell for him.  I fell for him ...it....that there.  And the match seemed pratical too.  George would take over the college.  But then daddy started watching for a couple of years ....getting angry baby?  He started watching for a couple of years and began to think that maybe Georgia boy didn't have it in him.  ....getting angrier baby?  Until he watched for a couple of years and began to see that Georgie boy didn't the stuff.  That Georgie boy didn't have it in him.  In fact, he was something of a flop.  A great big fat flop."  That's it more or less;  you'd need to get the exact version.  It was a play before it was a movie.    One of the ones that doesn't involve profanity-- "George, my husband... George, who is out somewhere there in the dark, who is good to me - whom I revile, who can keep learning the games we play as quickly as I can change them. Who can make me happy and I do not wish to be happy. Yes, I do wish to be happy. George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad. Whom I will not forgive for having come to rest; for having seen me and having said: yes, this will do."  (yeah, she's talking about the same guy)    The Lion in Winter has a couple for Eleanor of Aquitaine. -- "Of course he has a knife, he always has a knife, we all have knives! It's 1183 and we're barbarians! How clear we make it. Oh, my piglets, we are the origins of war: not history's forces, nor the times, nor justice, nor the lack of it, nor causes, nor religions, nor ideas, nor kinds of government, nor any other thing. We are the killers. We breed wars. We carry it like syphilis inside. Dead bodies rot in field and stream because the living ones are rotten. For the love of God, can't we love one another just a little - that's how peace begins. We have so much to love each other for. We have such possibilities, my children. We could change the world."

I too hate that they pick the pop rappers who really know nothing about the culture to talk about it.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Oh jeez.|`|m2UUrurBaa	Well jeezy brought it on himself he should know that fox news lives for ignorance, and what he and jigga did was ignorant, i just hope jeezy doesn't get owned.|`|0d88ab7c3e5ace15a916d7103b2561abaa	young jeezy is not stupid but i am from atl and it would be a crime to say that.. if he is going to be on the show you should watch it because he is not as stupid as you think... just because his lyrics are not like other rappers doesn't mean he isn't intelligent that is just his style.. i think he could should ppl how much he does for the community and not make us look bad|`|AA10645224	O'REALLY|`|cMHSpGXWaa	how do you know jeezy is stupid|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	N*ggaz beware!!!!!|`|oslQ0eyPaa	he's not going to the o'reilly's show. yea it would be a mistake because o'reilly could out-argue jeezy anyday. hate him but i think jeezy is not the right person to argue with in this situation. someone smarter. jeezy did diss him on the new remix of black president with jay-z.    black president remix ft. jay-z   http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=35961
6ZmiuwWDaa	Jack Nicholson stole my pen while giving autographs, he then said it was on the floor lol.|`|4ceZ13CEaa	I worked in a restaurant in TN all the way through college and waited on Vince Gill and his daughter. They were nice. She also went to my high school. I waited on Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and their family. She was dressed down with little make up and a baseball hat and was JUST as stunning as she is all made up. They were so very down to Earth. And I also waited on Alan Jackson who wasnt very talkative and kind of grouchy and finally Donna Summers and a large party. She was very pleasant.|`|AA11897918	I don't know if this is a "best encounter" but it is a true one and one that I cherish.    It was July 1st, 1907(in Kingston, On where Dan Akroyd was born)  I was going down town on the electric scooter Veteran's Affairs gives to pensioned vets.    Ahead was a big (6'2") guy with an even bigger smile. We spoke and he put his big hand out saying, "Dan Akyroyd".  I'm a real fan of Ackroyd movies and I happened to know that this was Dan's birthday (he was 55).    So we chatted and I told him that I has enjoyed all his great movies  all the way back to The Blue Brothers,but that I often thought of  My Girl 2 and the sweet scene when Anne Chlumsky listened to her long deceased mother singing "Smile".    Dan's eyes visibly teared and he agreed it was s movie to remember.  Then Dan reached down and gave me a  hug and wished me well.    You can easily imagine why I still cherish this encounter with a celebrity.|`|vbwv694Uaa	Met Trish Stratus and she was so nice and super cool.

Hrgp1oC5aa	No one knows real gore do they? Being a horror nut, the Guinea Pig films are nothing but EXTREME gore...especially Flower of Flesh and Blood. One of the films was turned over to the FBI because Charlie Sheen thought it was a real snuff film. That would be the goriest and most disturbing...not scary though, just sick.     Here is the wikipage for it:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_Pig_...     Also Cannibal Holocaust is up there but I have not seen it because they really slaughtered some animals on camera for it. The makers of the film had to go on trail in Italy because they thought they really killed the actors on camera and the film was banned. The actors showed up to say "Hey..I'm alive." and the film was shown....but it is still banned in many countries.|`|QT8vmBfsaa	Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the goriest movie that Ive ever witnessed.|`|QikvnTnqaa	The worse one I saw was Saw 5 (or the last one-whatever number).

You spelled Archuleta wrong.    They are different kinds of singers. If you mean a better voice in the traditional sense, then David Archuleta. If you mean for current music, both of them are super for current music.  Archuleta's voice is a more smooth pop voice, Cook's is a more rock voice.     I'm an Archuleta fan but I like Cook's album too.|`|ZYldgOdTaa	They are both really good.

cRhkkBAEaa	He is still as popular.   Just not as active as he was in the 80s and 90s.     He is working on a new album though, and he says that we've only seen half of his career yet.    So dont give up!    And don't make MJ give up!    Fans have to stand for the truth and make more people love MJ otherwise there will be nobody watching him perform!|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	Bad publicity about him has become big business and for the past 8 years since his last album, that's the most what the public was getting. And he has been on a low profile. I think the allegations really hurt his career and he is being given a hard time for a comeback. He managed to have new fans though with his old work, even when he is being maligned he still gets new fans. But basically the media is not really friendly with him and it's all negative that they put out. But whatever!  He is still well loved by many!|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	who cares about michael jackson. his time is over. he is old. the world has to keep turning. lil wayne now is the best male entertainer in the world!!!!!!!  i heard they wanted to do a thriller musical and michael wanted 50% of the profit!! what a greedy moron. for celebrities, where is the limit on wanting more money?|`|IHUS8wsbaa	dung!     lols  mike is still amazinginly popular. Look at my yahoo answers questions ive answered ha ha most are on mike, al most all my best answers are on michael jackson. Im a fourteen year old fan, and i find so so many people who love mikes music and dance. ITs the dumb rumours that people belive that are not true. mikes innocent. but some people dont believe it, instead they believe inaccurate tabloids this is why he is not as popular. also he hasnt made an album in a while and his last one was not one of his bests!. But mikes music is still as popular as ever!. In october last year Thriller in halloween was again the  1 seliing album. When ever i look at a friends i pod or anyones ipod I usually find atleast two songs by mj, sometimes i dont but on average i do. Mike still rocks in the music world, he has inspired a lot of recent artists.  GO MIKE  KING OF POP stays on TOP  (rumoured he might make a new album and go on new tour)    from BAD ERA FAN!!!!|`|HXpOui7gaa	Hey x  Michael is still popular but mostly in the tabloids for stories about his court status or other BS like that.  Soon he will be back.  2009 is his comeback year.  The king shall reign again :)  Ly x|`|pT514qPUaa	If he's not famous now, fans (above) will not give their answer here. Because they don't know who Michael Jackson is. But now, he's still popular. Ask your neighbor. He will know who Michael is. Ask your classmates. They will know who Michael Jackson is. Ask your parents. They will know who Michael Jackson is. Ask your sisters or brothers. They will know, WHO MICHAEL JACKSON IS.|`|Omk5Q0yxaa	are u out of your mind??? the man is popular even when he is sleeping the tabloids are talking about him all the time!!|`|q7ZU0C85aa	I think hes not the popular because for one he is not coming out with any more music and isn't doing anything really big and second because he changed hes skin color when he should've left it alone. He is my hero and so is Stevie Wonder.
frqfB0usaa	Well Kakashi got the sharingon from Obito, His team mate, When Obito was dying (Half of his body was crushed by a rock -.-)  He wan'ted to give Kakashi a present for becoming a jonin (i think) and because he was dying he asked Rin (other team mate) to transplant his eye.  Ohh yeah. Btw. Kakashi lost his eye before because he saved Obito (i think) Then Obito gave Kakashi the eye  >.    I don't think anyone knows why Kakashi cover's his eye.|`|uctxzjIIaa	He got it from Obito Uchiha, and since he isn't an Uchiha, he can't turn it off. Also, since he isn't an Uchiha, using it drains him quite quickly.      And while fans long suspected Tobi was Obito, Tobi has revealed himself to be Madara, the founder of the Uchiha clan. If he was also Obito, there's be something seriously strange going on.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	Well the condition for having Mangekyou is to kill someone who's the closest to you... But most of Kakashi's dear ones are dead... That's probably how he has Mangekyou....      Because Kakashi is not an Uchiha he cannot turn it off... Closing one eye all the time is not an option so he covers it to avoid using it too much since he doesn't have what it takes to use Sharingan for long hours like Uchihas...     Obito is dead... Tobi is Madara Uchiha... The former leader of the Uchiha Clan and founder of the Hidden Leaf Village along with Senju (First Hokage...) Madara was going to be Hokage but in the end the people chose Senju instead and enraged Madara left and then returned to the village again to battle Senju only to be beaten really bad...  Because he has Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan he has lived for so long... When one gets Mangekyou they do eventually turn blind if they use it much so to keep them from going blind they need to have the eyes of another Uchiha... So Madara got his little brother's eyes which granted him Eternal Mangekyou, amazing power and a long life...|`|TQYof9Whaa	well i don't think he can turn it off his dead friend gave his eye to him so from the beginning it wasn't his eye|`|XOc1jO57aa	he covers his eye because when its uncovered for a long time it uses alot of his chakra if he leaves it uncovered for too long he needs to rest for a few days i saw it when they were taking that bridge builder

LGBO4V4naa	Magneto is schedule to have his origins movie<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_film_series" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_film_...</a><br>  Along with an X-Men First Class movie.<br>  <br>  Although Wolverine is the most popular X-Men I think Jean Grey/Phoenix could have an unbelievable story which could focus on space adventures.<br>  <br>  X-23 (Wolverine's female clone) could also have her own show. She is not very well known but she has a very interesting origin. <br>  <br>  Gambit too has a life outside X-Men which could go into his unexplained loyalty to Sinister, his life in the Thieves Guild, his meeting with Storm and so on. <br>  Storm too could have her own movie (provided she wasnt the boring pushover from the movie) her life in Africa, as a thief, as a Goddess, meeting Black Panther, her run in with Shadow King etc.<br>  <br>  I think a future X story would be great, Cable returning from the future to warn the X-Men of some impending doom. Cyclops and Phoenix Cameos all the way through. <br>  <br>  Other than that I do not think many X-Men could carry a movie on their own.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	I can't really think of any.  Wolverine had a number of spinoff comic series, so there's plenty of material about his life before he hooked up with the  Xmen.  Even then, he sort of dropped in and out.<br>  <br>  Psylocke may be a good choice...she has enough of a backstory that could be made into its own movie, even though you'd have to sort of turn her into a tragic and sympathetic character.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Kitty Pryde<br>  <br>  'Nuff said.|`|vVka4ZA0aa	It's really hard to say. The reason Wolverine is so popular is because he's had the most struggle. He was created by the government, I believe the process was very painful. And because of his temper and "abilities" he's cast out so much that he just wanders as a loner, very rarely making friends.<br>  <br>  All of the X-Men are unique and interesting, but none of them have really had enough of a struggle to make a movie. <br>  Maybe Beast, didn't he have a wife?<br>  It just seems that they're best when they're together. But even in the comics Wolverine was on his own a few times. He's like the Punisher a little bit, he's darker and has more edge.<br>  <br>  Magneto might be the only X-Men you could really make a spin off with. He had a hard life, and he's a little darker too. Also, his powers are much more fantastic than the movies showed.|`|0GYtvyLzaa	Nightcrawler is a cool character. I wish the the X-Men movies would have featured more of him. I think his adventures would be good enough for a spin off. The fact that he can teleport to different diminsions and become different versions of himself is awesome in itself.|`|RNpaBwxzaa	I can sort of imagine a Gambit movie coming sometime after X-Men Origins: Wolverine, since he will be introduced there.|`|GH4ExWmyaa	Iceman would be a good candidate, hes had many excursions with spiderman, and lets face it, putting spiderman and x-men together in a movie would have the comic book community freaking out. If not iceman, id say cyclops. He got his powers after falling out of an airplane with his brother who also get powers, while his parents died in the crash, he was Xavier's first student(showing the beginning of the institute) and his romantic excursions make for a good plotline.|`|AA10296841	i kinda agree with what was said that the other x-men that would work would be mageto since they did a movie Jumper and his abilities were similar to nighcrawlers so its already been done
yyIVrngcaa	My boyfriend is also a LEO, we hardly get along, he doesn't laugh at my jokes, I've bruised his ego more than any woman ever has...I've messed up time and time again, yet he is still here. Leo men are very complicated....I act quite erratic and annoying with him at times as well, all he does is tell me I make him feel like ****, and he has a point...I need way too much attention, attention he himself can't always give me, he works long hours, and is always tired, when we talk on the phone sometimes it's like i'm talking to a wall...but when we;re together, thats a different story :) we still fight but we're absolutely crazy for eachother...<br>  I'm a virgo...and leo-virgo relationships are quite complicated...rare to last.<br>  all I know is Leo men need lots and lots of attention and affection...I don't know how you can get him back...as we've already told you...relax, if it's meant to be. It will.<br>  And if he's asking for space, please, give him space...he needs it, it won't be long til he comes back to you...but relax, get a hold of yourself and forget about him in the meanwhile. let him surprise you.|`|geih5vR8aa	It has nothing to do with your astrological signs. It has to do with you being a stalker, and making the relationship difficult for him makes him feel you are not worth the trouble.<br>  <br>  The only way to get him back is to change... and changing is very difficult.  He doesn't like you for who you are, and to me, THAT in itself is NOT worth it. If you guys are having this many problems, and you are THAT obsessive about him, then it may be best to just give him some space for awhile.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	flattery is the way to go.<br>  without crying or anything just make pretend you are a little over it .but let him know what a perfect bf he was and how lucky you were tohave been in relationship. But don't grovel, just be casual. It's knida hard to win a leo back. <br>  But my leo gave me a second chance because i just planted the seed that i missed incredibly and that our relationship was the highlight of my entire life. lol. but i didn't come right out and say it i just hinted and he came back. sadly i had a bf at the time and i don't believe in getting back together . A word of caution , the pisces a not a good match for leo at all. Leo will tire of psices gloomy moods sometimes, the pisces person almost always walks away from this heart broken :-(<br>  " A brief affair is possible but long-term love is not so promising for Leo. Pisces could swim away in a sea of tears. "|`|bvwYVGJOaa	yes <br>  <br>  1. Stop nagging him/stalking<br>  2. Stop your clinginess and do something else<br>  3. Pull yourself together and control your own emotions, no one will help you on it, only you can help yourself<br>  <br>  4. If you love him, you gotta learn to let him go. Give him the space he needs, and if you can't do that, then he will look elsewhere for love.<br>  <br>  Leo's bring in ideas that most people would often find bizzare or crazy but it's them basically and do NOT ever cross them or make fun of him or even negative or you'll lose him for good.|`|hSOaKnzgaa	Pisces people are very, very erratic and so drama filled. Your Leo man wants you to leave him alone because you are so weak. Try getting some self respect and stay out the kitchen if you can't handle the fire.<br>  <br>  You'll be better off with a cancer.|`|qiq95Yz7aa	just ignore him for a while. Leos love attention and pride, if they dont get that, they're gonna crave for it. Dont worry, just have patience.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	use all your creative qualities that pisces is gifted w/ like being intuitive sexually. pisces r gifted lovers cuz they can sense just what a lover wants. be at your most feminine & attractive when around him. and be a ear for him to vent his probs/ troubles too, as pisces r good listeners. start out by keeping thing lite & breezy w/him drop any negative things/moods that can spoil any chances of getting him back. use that picses sense of humor w/him. piceans r known 4 their wry wittiness. be the pisces woman u were when u first attracted him. and act just a little bit out of reach when he does start responding (like having 2 go somewhere w/o him (u can make up something or actually go 4 a girl's nite out.) this will trigger the chase instinct in him for u again. plus dont 4-get the compliments--leo's love praise, but be specific, men love praise about something concrete they can grasp. "your wonderful" just goes over  their head. eg. if hes great a mechanics, praise how hes good at fixing car probs, if hes a sports player like football, basketball or even a good pool player , compliment those skills _eg"wow i wish i could make those shots like that" and laugh at his jokes, men esp. leos love to think they r entertaining & fun to be with.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	dont do it. he is a fire sign. you are water. you cannot mix. you will try to put out his fire and you are already trying to do it by being negative.  time to move on. if you care about him you will leave him alone.

Its not reggae or ska but it is cool.|`|1s3hBaC1aa	Torture Me by Red Hot Chilli Peppers  Miami April 29, 1992 by Sublime  Hang Drum by Manu Delgado  Jerry Was a Racecar Driver by Primus|`|CD79kVcZaa	Reggae songs...       ...neither one is *really* reggae, but there's a few Police songs, as well as "Watching the Detectives" by Elvis Costello.     Regarding the Police, Sting is a bit underrated as a bass player. He just isn't showing off or anything; he's singing at the same time, of course.   Try "Walking on the Moon," or "Message in a Bottle," or even "Roxanne."   Getting used to just the timing of those songs will open up interesting rhytmic ideas for you.     Oh, and "Fools in Love" by Joe Jackson sort of fits into the not-quite-reggae heading the others I listed do.|`|B7EObhzRaa	You could try to learn some Streetlight Manifesto. They have alot of very technical bass parts. You could also learn higher ground by the chillis. i shot the sherrif is pretty good to play.
AA10450854	Yep, I like them - great band! They're not really that "new", as Mother Earth came out in 2001. Their last album from 2007, The Heart of Everything, is really good too. If you like this type of music, be sure to also check out The Gathering ("If-Then-Else", "Nighttime Birds", "How To Measure a Planet" are my personal fav's!) and Nightwish (anything by them).    Rock on!

6U9b2t4raa	NO....I like my " grass " just the way it is.  It's soft and smells good.  I love to just roll around on "it" every chance I get.       Do not get me wrong..it can get demanding at times.  It likes a good drink, so I always whip out the hose to water it down.        Plus, there is nothing finer than the smell of a freshly cut " lawn"     And what is the point of trading if you already have the best one* available?|`|BMYOukx5aa	Yes it is because my dog pees on my grass and kills it|`|Nyz9Ym0xaa	Umm...on the other side of the hedge it is, yes.

Michelle Obama. I can dream...|`|fZEGTGP7aa	Life is never what it seems,       we're always searching in our dreams,       to find those little castles in the air!       When worry starts to cloud the mind,       it's hard to leave it all behind,       an' just pretend you haven't got a care!             There's someone else in your imagination,       you wished that you were standin' in their shoes      you'd change your life without much hesitation       but would you if you really had to choose?             So, don't look around,       get your feet on the ground,       it's much better by far       to be just who you are!              The other man's grass is always greener,       the sun shines brighter on the other side!      The other man's grass is always greener,       some are lucky, some are not,       just be thankful for what you've got!                       Many times it seems to me,       there's someone else I'd rather be,       living in a world of make-believe!       To stay in bed 'till nearly three       with nothing there to worry me       would seem to be the life I might achieve!             But, deep inside I know I'm really lucky,       happiness I've never known before,      just as long as you are there beside me       I know that I could ask for nothin' more!             And living can start,       with the love in your heart!       So, with you all the time,       all the chances I've longed for are mine!              The other man's grass is always greener,       the sun shines brighter on the other side!      The other man's grass is always greener,       some are lucky, some are not,       I'm so thankful for what I've got!|`|jR8ZWForaa	Trading spouses....oh my that topic seems to come up a lot.  Why trade when god has provided a good one for you already?

Before you laugh, think about that. It's not that the grass IS always greener - it's that we THINK it is while looking across the fence at it. I'm not saying love the one you're with neccesarily, but make sure the "grass" you're lookin' at is really grass & not just green weeds.|`|qvW5ZYruaa	Hmmm- Well. The cell next to mine has a concrete floor; just like mine. No grass in sight, i'm afraid.     Trade spouses? No spouse- no trade. Sorry.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Trading spouses is a sin.

8RflQ9DVaa	'Happy Christmas, War Is Over' by John Lennon.    1) Don't know    2) Ann Wilson    3) Billy Joel    4) Don't know    5) Evidently    Hi Magic... As you know I spend more time in the politics section of YA and just bop in here once in a while. And I think that tolerance in general has just gone by the wayside. There are still a few here that are mature enough to respect differing opinions, but as you said, a lot of those people are leaving. The YA boards seem to be turning into one big 'confirmation' fest. Either you agree and conform, or you get thumbs down, or worse, reported. Tis a pity.|`|JSTvjlYnaa	What is this "tolerance" you speak of?|`|xwUY2b8Jaa	I must admit that I may be a little elitist in my musical tastes. I do not, however, give TDs (which on the whole is useless and often abused) or refuse to listen to the opinions of others. Sure R&P is intolerant, but the fact is there are places on the internet (even within Y!A) that make it look like a preschool. I'm actually more annoyed when people answer "What is the worst band" with some unoriginal scapegoat band (you know which ones I'm talking about).    MA: Bob Dylan - Masters of War    BA: Dio.  BA2: Ann Wilson  BA3: Billy Joel  BA4: Georgia Satellites  BA5: No I'm not.|`|YkseyT7zaa	If you are complaining that you can't have an opinion without a thumbs down, you're complaining about someone else having an opinion, not that I agree with voting on a opinion choice. that doesn't quite make sense.    Anyway lighten up and don't take this stuff seriously|`|96AQZUGyaa	1) DO NOT use the word ignorant to define things that piss you off. That is not what that word means!!!!! Buy yourself a damn dictionary.    2) I agree that people are getting suppressed in regards to their opinions. You can't say anything without someone getting butthurt.    MA: "Cannibal" - Static-X... I'm not a vegetarian but its a great song.  BA: Who?  BA2: Who?  BA3: I only know Elton, he's mediocre.  BA4: Who?  BA5: Sadly yes.|`|ucQxe2e4aa	i am strictly thumbs up in this section.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Do people really get that bothered over TDs? Really. They're just virtual thumbs.|`|1vCoaf08aa	True, nobody wants to check out anything, the select few who don't have an open mind towards what we recommend.    BA: Fortunate Son - Anti-war.    BA: Van Zant  BA2: Ann Wilson (I love Heart)  BA3: Elton John  BA4: Georgia Satellites (close)  BA5: I sure am, lol.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I agree. I'll be honest, it really pisses me off when i see i got TDs. Not as much as it used to, but still kinda does...    It is annoying when people won't even stand to let others have an opinion, but whatever, i try not to let it bother me...    BQ: Dio  BQ3: Elton John    EDIT: Although i think that having a TC badge earns you more TDs anyway. But i hate it when theres a question such as "whatever band" Vs "whatever band" and people go and TD everyone who chooses the opposite band to them. Thats just pathetic. *cough* *cough* *Led Zeppelin v the doors* *cough* Ahem...  It takes a lot for me to TD someone. Only if they are being insulting or stupid or whatever on purpose to somone else, but thats all. I never ever TD someone 'cause they have a different opinion from me.|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Where have you been? It's been like that for a while now. That's why I only answer a few questions here in R&P. Don't worry about it, just a silly little thumbs down. At least you're not being set on fire.     MQ: "'Times They Are A-Changin'"  BQ3: Elton John|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I give anyone a fair listen, and I LOVE all genres of music, but not everyone has talent.  It would be a pretty boring world if we all liked the same thing.      MQ :"Sunday Bloody Sunday" U2  BQ: RONNIE JAMES!!!  BQ2: Ann Wilson  BQ3: Elton John  BQ4 Georgia Satellites  BQ5:  YES!!!!|`|DibFrwxlaa	I have started answering questions and then not looking at them again.    For whatever reason I rarely get TDd though.  When I first came on here it bothered me a little.  I never really used the internet other than emailing before I came here and I didn't understand the culture of anonymity.  Anyways, I really don't care a bit.  Go to the Politics section, that place will thicken your skin quick, fast, and in a hurry.    MA:  Naughty Girls Need Love Too - Samantha Fox (I firmly believe in this cause.)    BA:  Van Zant  BA2:  Lita Ford  BA3:  Billy Joel  BA4:  Molly Hatchet  BA5:  I think it's been well established that I have no life.    I know what you mean about TD being only an expression of what you're really talking about though.  I don't care.  I figure I'm older than about 85% of the people here, what some snot nosed little punkass thinks is no affair of mine.|`|Mx11gL67aa	I totally agree.   You could probably guess my favorite band is the Beatles by my username thing, so for "favorite band" questions, I always answer with The Beatles, and say like, my favorite songs, or albums, or a little bit of why I love them, because of their musical growth and diversity, etc.    Yet I ALWAYS get some thumbs downs!  Now I know that anyone who is serious about music wouldn't have thumbs down-ed me because although you may not LIKE The Beatles, there's no ignoring the fact that they changed music forever, started a cultural revolution, and their songs are now classics!     It's not that i really MIND the thumbs down's its just like, I cant help but think "what loser goes around and thumbs downs people like that?" But whatever.     BQ: I'm not really familiar with either, I don't want to answer uninformed.   BQ2: Ann Wilson  BQ3: Billy Joel :D  BQ4: Not sure!  BQ5: yup!

fcHN7Mrcaa	They're easy.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Sometimes, it isn't about the trashiness so much...as it is about being attracted to someone who *would* go out of her way to look "attractive" for you.  We can respect the effort if not the whole entire look itself.  The idea is that sometimes we find it attractive that a woman would do stuff *for us*, and not always for herself so much.<br>  <br>  But yeah, sometimes (some other times, that is), the decision process really *does* boggle the rational mind, doesn't it?  ^__^  Case in point: Octo-Mom.  Why on *earth* is the father/sperm-donor attracted to her?  Why would he keep on going through with this?<br>  <br>  It's an extreme example, yeah.  But it beats bringing up Tammy Faye Bakker (who divorced, and is what, an older lady these days?).<br>  <br>  Point is, sometimes there's just no figuring out attraction.  Hope this helps.|`|6mZJSqBgaa	I figure it's because guys are more easily impressed.  As women, we have standards for ourselves, and eachother.  Guys aren't always in tune to that, usually.

bribxhsdaa	EDIT - Tell me about some of my tendencies!     When has anyone called Lil Wayne a sellout? He's overrated and has the most annoying fans on the face of the the earth but he's not a sellout.    - Lil Wayne looks like Whoopi Goldberg  - He has kissed a man on camera and refused to deny the homosexual connotation you could attach to such an event.  - He's ad-libbed the words "BEST RAPPER ALIVE" into the heads of millions of kids.    None of those involve selling out.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	In some cases you'd have to be a mind reader to figure it out. Some artists are accused of selling out when they take a creative risk, and it's very hard to know if they really did or not.     I think when a rapper jumps on a popular bandwagon and you hear a distinctive downturn in quality, then it's probably safe to say they've sold out. Even if it didn't end up being financially successful for them.     There's nothing wrong with wanting to appeal to a wider audience - both from a financial and an artistic viewpoint. But making changes *purely* based on financial motives, with little thought for artistic integrity is selling out.     I don't think Wayne's sold out because he's pretty much doing what he's always done. Same with 50 - he gets accused of it a lot, but I don't see much difference in his early work to now.     For a rapper to change without selling out, I really think it's down to where their heart is when they make the change. For them to do it sucessfully can often just be down to luck.|`|dOurKVdiaa	When you say sell out, are you meaning in it or do it for the money?    If so, hell yeah, who wouldnt, i know i would, Money makes life easier, you can pay ya bills, take care of ya fam, why struggle with this, im keeping it real crap, get money, Cause trust me, there will come a day when we are going to think of Wayne as trash,    If you dont believe me, throw a baseball up in the air, and stand under it, if it doesnt hit you in your head, Wayne will be the best forever|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	it goes back to my first answer. As long as you don't compromise your integrity, then you can successfully change AND grow. I think if your art reflects the positive changes and growth in your life as whole, then you have been successful in having your art reflect that.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	Wait...Jay-Z isn't a sellout? Jay-Z is definitely a sellout. He's just managed to make people respect him for the things he's done that do make him a sellout.    EDIT: If you would classify Jay-Z as a smart businessman, then he's a sellout. A smart businessman and a sellout do nothing different. They both do whatever has the best financial outcome. The only difference in the common usage of those terms is you like the things a smart businessman does, and you don't like the things a sellout does. If you like Jay-Z's music, he's a smart businessman. If you don't like his music, he's a sellout. I choose to not differentiate. I'm not going to say he's not a sellout just because I like his music. If you're one, you're also the other.    EDIT: I don't mind choosing. If I use normal terms instead of my own irregular way of thinking, overall, he's a smart businessman, but there were several periods in his career where I thought he was a sellout. In other words, he's a good artist with a lot of bad material.|`|VclnZhSCaa	Face it! Money is sinful! Its disgusting. Yuck!

If not, Sami and Rafe would be okay.|`|TEqlfDByaa	RAMI RAMI RAMI!!!!!!|`|mFaxRACSaa	I think they will put sami and rafe together with a little of Ej jealousy and then she will have the fight between rafe and ej since there will be no more lucas and ej fights. I want sami to be happy, i used to hate her years ago when she was just like Nicoe is now, but they have had her change and I love sami now!!|`|to2pdSgpaa	I would have to say that I would love to see it, but sadly just about everytime Sami's life starts looking up, she ends up losing her man.|`|AA11334527	Im okay with Sami and Rafe, but I wonder if Lucas will be the one she is back with|`|JtcWfQ1uaa	Totally RAMI!!!!! and if not than I hope that EJ will go back to kinda sweet EJ and b with Sami cuz Lucas is leaving and I can't stand him anyway!!!!!|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	It doesn't really matter, b/c the writers will always sabotage Sammy and any man that she gets involved with

6abd3bdb56caa5b55d37adf04ec88a38aa	Well, Big D I won't call myself Old School as you find that disrespectful but, I'm guilty of saying it as that's what the younger generation referrs us in our 40+ yrs. LOL     Myself, I grew up listening to all sorts of stuff and sad but true you're right about a lot of things. It's as if the music industry is in a slump and can't come up with anything original.     Bluegrass- Bill Monroe original they were talented musicians, songwriters. Country- Dolly Parton has written a lot of stuff for herself and Whitney Houston did the remake of "I will Always Love You" and blew it out of the water. Doo Wop- The 50's music- The Platters, Nat King Cole, etc. The 60's and the British Invasion- Brought a lot of cool stuff into the mix. The Who, Hermitts Hermits, Eric Clapton, etc.   Motown- The Jackson Five, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Otis Reading, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations. Man, even their choregraphed stage performances were as awesome as their singing. The 70's had the Disco and some awesome rock The 80's even the beginning of rap like your Sugar Hill Gang, Grand Master Flash and the furious five- White Lines, LL Cool Jay, Beastie Boys, etc... Break Dancing for that matter.   Yeah, what happened to your Baby Faces, Lauryn Hills, Lionel Richies, Ray Charles, Bo Didley's, Nat King Cole's, B.B. King, Little Richard's etc. of the times.. There's Alicia Keys and she's done well, John Legend he's ok, The rest like you said sample alot from groups of yesteryear. I like listening to the acoustic versions of stuff as it seems to be more raw and it hits you in a different way than the studio remixing stuff. Even as you mentioned with the 90's stuff but, it's a different subject. LOL     It's as if the Musicians, Singer/Songwriters, Clean/Clear Lyrics of yesteryear are exactly that. Not that many good ones of today stand out. One thing you can say that when Run DMC & Aerosmith did Walk this Way that was considered ground breaking for it's time. Prince and his style of music. These people need to take a trip to Cleveland Ohio to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame or even to Grand River in Detroit Michigan to Hitsville USA the Motown Museum and check out what was inovative for it's time. They may learn something as well as appreciate what they call us old school. They took from that and add a few off the wall things and it's considered "original". Go figure.|`|dOurKVdiaa	I think that Radio and Retail made those classification to sell the music, they love categories,     Like people like my mother did want to back in day go in a store and have to look thru countless amounts of rap records to get to her Rick James and Stevie, so thats why you have those tags, so they can fit you into some type of box    Its the same with A.D.D., that wasnt around like in the 90's, just some sh8t they made up to sell some pills|`|DYZRk07xaa	i mainly listen to soul music with the vinyl sound to the 90's  i know what you mean it has dwindled  i adapt and check out what new  but so many artists these days  labels want more sexy than ability    sampling and remakes  for the deceased-i know they are rolling|`|wXv50mNEaa	1) Who calls classic R&B and soul "old school"? Isn't it just called classic R&B and soul?  2) The classics from this generation will be the great, very popular songs. R&B examples are OutKast's "Hey Ya!" and Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy."  3) Black music didn't transform from R&B to rap. There's still great R&B (some) and there's still great rap.  4) There have always been bad artists who were merely good dancers and singers.    edit: First (or fifth) of all, no, "the OutKast" (as you put it) could not have made in the early seventies; there was no rap, and there sound would be too radical to be the first rap group. It's sort of like needing Louis Armstrong before you can have Ornette Coleman.    And OutKast are artists in every way imaginable. Have you ever actually listened to them in depth, or have you just dismissed them for being rap?    I've heard the name, but know very little about him. But you're right; I shouldn't have said there was "no" rap in the early seventies. I should have said there was no mainstream acceptance of rap, and so OutKast's very "out there" sound would not have been accepted.    And you think that John Coltrane could make it today? There's no market for that type of music anymore. You think Chuck Berry could have made it in the twenties? Music takes time to progress.    And I really suggest you look into OutKast. I'm sure you're familiar with songs like "B.O.B." and "Hey Ya!", but you really should tap into their discography. You might be surprised, espcecially with A3K's experimentation of "The Love Below." For example. you might like his instrumental updated version of "My Favorite Things."    Mike B, there are a lot of "us white folk" who appreciate good new modern rock music, like TV on the Radio, Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend, Bob Dylan's new stuff, Radiohead, Primal Scream...|`|mJ9BveFjaa	Well I guess who invented RnB was Like a genies...  But yeh it keeps changin but it's not getting like rap....  cause RnB has been always relative to rap....  but I think RnB is getting more like dance....  like 4ever - chris brown  Closer - ne-yo  Right na na na - Akon  and it's not bad at all....|`|FAQldsUZaa	I wouldnt dare try to convince you that what you think about music now days is wrong. However I dont necessarily agree that R&B all talk about sucking d**k and ho's. However rap music does. I don't particularly like the "girl bands who dance around" either. I do however love Ne-Yo... I either listen to him, Avant, Jaheim, Keith Sweat, J. Holiday and Trey Songz. Now when I listen to some of those I hear "their old school"... which I dont agree with. Their not quite as "old" as Earth Wind and Fire.     But I think your entitle to your opinion... and it's a good argument :-)|`|WsWv4dBCaa	I agree. That's all I can pretty much say. I'm 23 but I know good music. I love love love, Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye. I just asked a Sam Cooke question a few minutes ago just basically asking were are the fans of GOOD music. I wish I was born 50 years before my time. The music was great and that's all people pretty much needed was a good song to get through the day. The stuff that comes out today is just sad.       Good Question.|`|WeGOz3vuaa	I think you're mainly talking about the way that record companies are handling the industry today. To somehow throw all of that on "rap" doesn't make sense. We white folk feel the same about modern rock as well. What the hell is all of this emo sh*t? What happened to the experimentation that was around even in the 90's?    Go listen to some neo soul if you want to hear "black" music on a different tip. D'Angelo's album voodoo has some of the sickest beats I've ever heard. They'll mess around with the kick and put it a little ahead of the beat in such a way that it throws you off - one of the coolest rhythmic experiments I've ever seen, especially on a multi-platinum selling record.

Pac may be your personal favourite, but I really don't think he was "better" than Biggie as an emcee. Not by a long shot.      ^^^^ Can you define how exactly Biggie was a sellout?

7f8EVUn5aa	haha that's hard to answer!  what do you usually watch?  i find that the shows my friends are watching don't usually correspond to what i like. it's super hard to figure out someone's taste..    i personally like the office, seinfeld and that 70's show reruns, degrassi's a pretty good soap-opera-esque show.  it's not super dramatic and corny, but it's semi interesting.  family guy isn't bad for mindless humor.      Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares is an awesome show, actually!  this brutally honest guy goes into failing restaurants and yells at the owners til they start making wiser decisions and completely turns their restaurants around.  there's two shows: ramsay's kitchen nightmares and just kitchen nightmares.  the second one is set in the US and is more like a reality tv show.  it's not as good.  The good one is on BBC.    American Idol is in the interesting part now, where the auditions are going on.  that's always fun to watch.    More good BBC shows, if you get that channel:  As Time Goes By and Keeping Up Appearances. they both had pretty big followings, but they're reruns now.    hmm yeah that's all i got.|`|ng1Io0xnaa	House M.D is a drama but it's actually really hilarious!

sOgLLlDraa	I think that Chance was acting like an arrogant asshole to everyone. But he always does so no surprise. Even Real was acting cocky and less down to earth. The way they acted to Rabit was wrong. She didn't flip herself around, they flipped her back and forth. If she was fake like they said then she would have switched side because Chance never took her serious but Real did.    They was no reason for either of them to be mean to Sexy Legs! Chance lied about her coming onto him and Real saw that afterwards so they both should have apologized to her. She had a right to be mad when she pretty much was treated like a whore.    They were too hard on Bubbles also...I mean how can you hate her for having feelings for a man she was in a actual relationship with in the past, yet you tell all these women that you have feeling for them.    Bay Bay Bay gets on my nerves. She doesn't know how to just talk, not preach and sound like a idoit at Sunday Church. She dissed Milf for getting with a man after going off the show, yet she was "engaged" so obviously she did right away too.    oh and I just wanted to say that Cornfed looked sooo good at the reunion. She looked really pretty with the new hair! Too bad Real didn't sound too convincing that they have a future!|`|3xmgwQyxaa	I thought the whole thing was kind of lame. I didn't see the point of Chance mean to Bubbles. Especially So Hood, what was her problem? Also, this was filmed 3 months after the show ended (which was one month long) and Bay Bay Bay is already engaged?!? Real was talking about Milf getting into a relationship after the show, at least she didn't run and get engaged like Bay Bay Bay!!    I doubt Real and Cornfed will stay together. Here's to hoping there is a Real Chance at Love 2!|`|AA10715639	He was , and not only to sexy legs but to bubbles too . Because him and bubbles left off on good terms  & then on the reunion he was acting like that to her , & I know real is chances older brother & all but he didn't need to try and defend chance with sexy legs because chance was in the wrong . That shows real didn't really like her like that because if he did, he would have been ,mad at chance because he made him send home a girl he liked , but instead he was more mad at sexy legs for attacking chance , which he deserved|`|rabjcdjHaa	I thought the reunion show was okay! I really didn't like how Chance treated Bubbles and Sexy Legs on the reunion show! He was being really mean to both women! Chance is just very annoying and immature!     Also, I was happy when Real and Corn Fed decided that they wanted to be together, but according to Corn Fed's MySpace blog, Real and Corn Fed are no longer together! I am definitely not shocked or surprised by that news!|`|VxN6DJ54aa	Too much editing.  I hear they left out some good stuff.  They did Sexy Legs dirty.  Both of them.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i think he was being a jerk to her but u know what he is probally a jerk to all woman i don't like him and i will never like him
CD79kVcZaa	Rarely would they be an insult... it might be uncomfortable for an original singer to see another version eclipse theirs, in terms of sales, chart position, etc. but they'd end up benefiting from the other version in the long run, due to increased interest in the song itself.|`|R3glUmwHaa	I'd say a compliment to the original.  After all, if the song sounded terrible to begin with, who would want to cover it?  The only thing that annoys me is when they do covers of newer songs that you still hear on the radio fairly often.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	As long as they're done with consideration and an interpretation similar to the original,then no.  It's been happening since music began.    Now remixes,they certainly are|`|FCUB2YL4aa	I'd be honored if somebody did one of my songs (: it's more like a compliment.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	It really depends.. Have you ever checked out the Radio One covers? Youtube them if you haven't, they're brilliant!|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I've always thought so.  I also think they do it because they think they can do it better, but that's just my opinion.  = )|`|8q5SeYueaa	I think it's a tribute to the original artist.

Btsctjydaa	It's better to throw up IN the meeting.|`|AA10285288	I have felt that feeling before. Not with my boss, but in some other life situations. It can be very devastating. Especially when you think you have been doing a good job - whatever the situation may be. <br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better at all (it probably doesn't), I enjoy your questions and answers on here! That should count for something. It takes a special kind of talent to make it in Yahoo Answers these days.|`|snUDfcfgaa	My old boss was like that.  Anytime I was called into her office I know it was not good news and it usually ended with a write up. I think she was just jealous because she knew that I was smarter than her.

In retaliation, blow off the rest of the work day and hang out on answers.|`|7d6d1be3884cf46230d224bf7dd43f47aa	yeah i have felt that way.....and everyone snaps at everyone around here occasionally too.....doesn't make for a great work day and makes me feel less productive and increasingly overwhelmed.....cheer up nerd, don't let him get to you.......you know your ability so don't let him knock it..... i happen to think that even for this forum where you are not required to do so, you write very well|`|ZNViGvidaa	i have felt like this, I think we all have. When it has happened to me, I have become fearful and sick to my stomach thinking "omg, what if they let me go?"<br>  <br>  he could just be jealous because of all the "under-your-desk-action" you are getting from his secretary while he is not.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I usually feel nauseated before the meeting, not after.

rDsKB0uXaa	it isn't there the judges who pick good voices|`|hCI6HFEnaa	So many of the contestants are a bit boring.    I think it'll be a bit more focused on the contestants once the auditions are over.    But American Idol seems like it really IS all about the judges; mainly because things always happen with them, they're all dramatic.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	I agree; they're all has-beens in their former industry.|`|B3N388wBaa	I've noticed that too. It's like the idols come just to play the fool in their games. And once they find that right person, they make the person what they want until the contract is over with.|`|gRW5X4vZaa	Ummm... it isn't. People have a tendency to focus on the judges because they are the same every time (until this season). But, in reality, people watch American Idol to see people make a fool out of themselves, and then there are those few standouts.

syT3XUAraa	When somebody loses a loved one, it can be a very tough, emotional, stressful time. Right now, she needs you and anybody else close to comfort her. Depending on her emotional state, I personally wouldn't give anything to remind her of her loss. If someone close to me was going through this, I would just remain at their side as much as possible, and offer a shoulder to cry on if needed. Just pay close attention to anything she has to say, and be the best friend you can to her to make her feel better. My condolences.|`|q95YF2Hhaa	my shades|`|IKs0my9aaa	My mom got killed by Unknown|`|IpWTMetHaa	I would write a nice letter of condolence to whomever lost a loved one. :)|`|xwvsObGLaa	I dont belive in giving time but will spend some time with her so that she would feel better|`|AA10142515	The best thing for someone who has just lost a mother, be there for them if they need a shoulder to cry on or someone to just listen.

PY36EofEaa	Blake Shelton      ------ It Aint Easy Bein Me    There ought to be a town out there,  Named for how I feel.  Yeah I could be the mayor down there,  And say welcome to Sorryville.  It won't be on a map nowhere,  You might say that it doesn't exist,  But if you make enough wrong turns  It'd be hard to miss.    There ought to be a bridge somewhere  They could dedicate to me.  I'd probably come to the ceremony  With a can of gasoline;  Walk on over to the other side  And there I'd light a match  And sit and stare through the smoke and the flames  Wonderin' how I'm ever gonna get back.    Why do I do the things I do?  Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?  I shoot the lights and curse the dark;  I need your love but I break your heart;  And I know the words that'll bring you back,  But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack.  I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be;  It ain't easy bein' me.    Ought to be a side show act for freaks like me;  Yeah I could be the star of the show  With my name on the marquee.  In a room with a big red button that says "Do Not Touch,"  And twice a day I'd mash it down  And you could watch me self-destruct.    Why do I do the things I do?  Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?  I shoot the lights and curse the dark;  I need your love but I break your heart;  And I know the words that'll bring you back,  But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack.  I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be;  It ain't easy bein' me.

It is incredible, their winding compositions sound just as good or better live.  Plus they did a bunch of older songs and improved upon each one of them, with better vocals and guitar solos.  Incredible is an understatement.<br>  <br>  In addition, the three/four album Woodstock live collection is phenomenal.  It captures performances from a large variety of people, including all of the famous ones like Santana's Soul Sacrifice, Hendrix's voodoo child, and joe cocker's rendition of with a little help from my friends.

DWBN7wDbaa	I really suggest not using Limewire anymore. It has a lot of spyware built into the program itself which infects your computer. And the network has a lot of fake files, and it has many viruses.    WinMX has no spyware, no fake files, and is fast and easy to use.    It even blocks the RIAA/MPAA from getting on the network, so you can't possibly be caught downloading/uploading.    http://www.getwinmx.com    It even forwards ports for you so you don't have to do it yourself.|`|mTJJPtl9aa	There's junk mail in everything. It's definitely a scam.    PS. if you really want to get good music use Torrents, not limewire.

AA10246871	I give it a solid 8.3. Another 1.0 is missing because it's live, and live is rarely, in my opinion, as good as a studio version. I've seen Depeche Mode three times in concert, and they do usually get almost a 9.5 for that, but it's because the crowd and the energy make up for a lot of what's missing in my rating.<br>  <br>  There was something very odd which struck me as I watched the video. All the pointy metal looking stuff in the background was an ironic touch for a concert in Berlin. It looks like a bigger and slightly denser version of the obstacles the Germans used at the beaches at Normandy when they were building the Atlantic Wall. Some set designer either doesn't know history very well, or has a weird sense of irony and humor.<br>  <br>  I do like the song very much. Dave Gahan's voice is great, as always, though it is changing a bit as he gets older. As I think of it, though, he doesn't generally sing quite as well live as he does in the studio. That's fine--I don't sing as well in my truck as I do in the shower. I must add that I would prefer to not have to look at his wedding band, but that's just a personal preference. I've been waiting for him to show up on my doorstep for about 25 years now, and I hate being reminded that he married the wrong woman. Poor him. <br>  <br>  Overall, I enjoyed the lyrical irony, as well. When you consider their solid working class roots, the song can be seen as an anthem to where they came from. They didn't come all the way from the ghetto, but they certainly didn't come from the West End, boarding school, weekends in the country scene, either. <br>  <br>  Since they are one of my favorite bands in the world, I will leave you with just one of my favorites by them. They considered it a throw-away when it was released, but I believe it's gained ground in the 20+ years since then:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiS_tB80EEQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiS_tB80E...</a>|`|7l5V6CsGaa	I love it <br>  I think it just became my new fave DM song <br>  <br>  BQ:Condemnation - Depeche Mode<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1f10d_3-5w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1f10d_3-...</a>|`|rytSFBbgaa	Great song thanks for the post <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59L5eY51Jw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59L5eY51...</a>|`|7B2s7maWaa	10 =)<br>  <br>  bq: "Personal Jesus", "Enjoy The Silence", "Just Can't Get Enough", "Policy of Truth","See You"|`|GVf1Ho7haa	wow thanx so much this song is just incredible <br>  I can actually relate to the lyrics which is kinda scary lol<br>  depeche mode is excellent<br>  <br>  dream on:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqW8VeP_xo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqW8VeP_...</a><br>  <br>  its no good:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe6oqtjD_8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe6oqtjD...</a><br>  <br>  suffer well<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21NQUJ6ykpg&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21NQUJ6yk...</a>|`|kC3VwbfRaa	i love DM! and this song is, uh, great- dont wanna rate it.<br>  <br>  edit: the more i listen to "WRONG" the more i love it. thanks!<br>  <br>  my fave is this:<br>  <br>  Depeche Mode - Precious<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VXZmu-ofq0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VXZmu-of...</a>|`|kbzhKBouaa	Hey Jukebox, long time no see   <br>  GREAT SONG, did not even know they had a new one coming out<br>  <br>  Favorite Depeche song<br>  Enjoy The Silence|`|jMaKld8xaa	LIVE for BERLIN<br>  <br>  very nice<br>  <br>  love it <br>  <br>  <br>  1-personal jesus<br>  2-master and servant<br>  3-somebody<br>  4-black celebration<br>  5-I feel you|`|jNn91TwDaa	I think it's a great song.<br>  Martin Gore deserves to get mentioned more when people start naming all time great songwriters.|`|jMEz9F0Saa	Hi Jukebox!<br>  <br>  I really like it.

There would be so many to read.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	I am not 100% sure, but if they do read them, then the deletions really don't make sense.<br>  <br>  I have my doubts they could actually read all of them anyway, because there are 100's if not 1000's reported every day and they disappear seemingly minutes after being reported.<br>  <br>  So is they are read, it would take a lot of people to cover it all.<br>  <br>  No matter how they are doing it though, it seems there really isn't a standard.  I see racist comments which stay on forever, but someone will get their question deleted because they say "Bush is an idiot" or "Obama is an idiot" or "I disagree with Christians".  <br>  <br>  None of those should be deleted in my mind because this is a free speech country and none of them are racist or anything like that.  You might not agreee with them, but they don't cross the line. But I still see them get deleted because someone reports them as violating the rules.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	They probably don't read them...who knows. They delete stuff that is the honest truth!

Although, it may be safer that way.|`|DkVofG9paa	oh hell yeah! it's a btch aint it!|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Yeah.  Sigh.  Don't you hate it when that happens?|`|FUYirIQ6aa	A few times.

l0Ye97Hjaa	TOO MANY! and im gunna ruin them all too.     THE MIST - when the dad mercy kills his son, and the three other people in the SUV and then the army arrives to save them RIGHT AFTER. me and my friend sat in the theatre for like 5 minutes after that happened, in complete shock.    ATONEMENT - when venessa redgrave admits that robbie and cecilia both died during the war, and she never atoned for sending robbie to jail and destroying their relationship.     THE GODFATHER - when they close the door on diane keaton - its classic.    ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT - when the guy (can't remember his name), lying in the trench, reaches out for a butterfly just outside the parapets, and he gets shot off screen and dies, and the movie ends in complete silence - brilliant.     ALL ABOUT EVE - when eve returns to her apartment after the awards show, and some girl has got into her hotel room, and begins to manipulate her, like eve did to bette davis.|`|uRsCRc1Haa	The movie Seven|`|56bNLJykaa	i'm going to have to disagree.. maybe the ending of raging bull, la strada, breathless (godard's), the 400 blows, etc.|`|O9HLoDj9aa	I love the ending of the movie American Beauty and Closer.|`|8718XQl1aa	Saving Private Ryan  Black Hawk Down  Scindler's List  Sixth Sense|`|aJRjOXpwaa	One of my favourites is from Enemy at the gates.

EioOPbzbaa	Wow, that brought back memories, thanks.  You know so many of these characters where never killed off and not mentioned.  I know most are overseas, i.e. Mike, Carie, Jennifer and Jack.  Hey, they could start another show on the european side.  That might be pretty interesting.  I would like to have them do an on the air update of Marie, Tommy, especially Bill and Laura.  And Abigail was staying with Maggie then left, well how is she and did she go to Jack and Jennifer?  They could mention all this without actually bringing anyone back but that would be nice for a reunion show, maybe for the holidays.  I know several of them have gone to other shows (Mike, old Mickey).|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I totally loved this !

6vzpHTqQaa	George Lopez    The woman who plays his wife (Constance Marie) is very attractive.  Plus, Carrie (King of Queens) was rather condescending.  Every time I turn that show on, she's yelling at Doug for doing something any one of us would have done.  She has problems.    George Lopez's wife: easy on the eyes, better pesonality, better date|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Yah -- go for the George Lopez wife.  Carrie on King of Queens is biatchy.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	Definitely George Lopez. There were a couple of episodes about how Doug and Carrie met, and one of them where they met she was terribly mean.

d35359baf6d78a22be5f24f3f6e0fab7aa	I checked wiki out, though it's written 150+, episode 146 is this week's episode(so ep. 156 is not yet out). If the episode doesn't have a title yet, then it's not out yet, and there's a date on the right side on each episode. <br>  <br>  Gintama is Ahead in the RAWs and it takes at least 1 week before it comes out. ( For translators, don't know if there are still people translating it)<br>  <br>  Regarding Crunchyroll, if you realized that crunchyroll has less shows right now than in the past then it's because crunchyroll is supporting the creators, so if you want to watch Gintama and the other shows like Shugo Chara, Skip Beat, etccc.. the same day it aired in Japan then you have to get the membership.. if not you must wait a week later. <br>  <br>  Gintama is licensed so the legal place to watch it is crunchyroll. It's quite hard to find the episodes out of that site.

8Kwwgtvlaa	No..I think that Desmond's focus would be more so OFF the island because of the fact the he is Daniel's constant and Penny is his constant.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	He probably does have to go back.  After all, the plane would not have crashed in the first place without Desmond.  But Ben knows that the O6 don't know where Desmond is right now.  They are floating around somewhere in the ocean.  So he is just referring to Jack getting the other 5 together.      Besides, Ben wants to kill Penny.  So I'm betting he is gonna tackle the problem of finding Desmond and Penny and getting Desmond back to the island himself, so he can do both without Jack's "Do-good'r" interference.|`|4YSSOO7Taa	No, Desmond was not one of the flight 815 survivors...  Only the survivors needed to return.    I don't think why the "Oceanic 6" must return has been fully confirmed. (To my knowledge, to oceanic 6 are Hurley, Jack, Kate, Jin, Sun and Sayid. I don't understand how this is though, because Jin is dead, and it doesn't include Locke).    I have read that they have to return to manage 6 different DARMA stations. Either that, or to get the island back into the correct time zone, they must return to it, Looking the same as they first did (Jack shaving beard etc.)    As i said though, I don't think the reason has yet been confirmed...|`|QmBIVAs9aa	Desmond is in a separate category.  There is no extra effort needed to take Des to the Island in case of necessity;  He's destined to the island in some way, as already declared in season 3 ( Flashes B4 Your Eyes) by the "time police" Miss Hawking ( the old lady at the jewellery shop who refused to sell the wedding ring to Desmond)|`|nDDnbAq2aa	Desmond will go back anyway, remember Daniel talked to him during one of the back in time things, told him they were all in danger and he had to save them.  Then he woke up and remembered.   What I wonder is why the island needs the 815 people, and what about the ones that have died?  I guess they're not important?  What about Jin and Michael who died on the boat, guess they don't have to go back, huh?!|`|JCdBSULraa	It hasn't been said that he doesn't need to go back.   However my personal understanding is that his role on the island is coming to an end.  He may very well return thanks to Daniel's mom in Oxford, and take Penny with him when he returns.  If there's one thing this show has taught us, it's that you never know what to expect.  Hurley could even prevent all of them from returning with his latest antics, causing a magnificent disaster that will occupy the remaining 30 episodes and make you forget about all the questions that were unanswered from the first 4 seasons.|`|k19933TAaa	he was not no the plane so no.

jLvlcoFBaa	I assume you meant the films he directed.    He has produced many more.    Directed films below over 2 hours.    The Island. 2 hrs, 16 min.    Bad Boys II. 2 hrs, 27 min.    Pearl Harbor. 3 hrs, 3 min.    Armageddon, 2.5 hrs.    The Rock. 2 hrs, 16 min.    Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does not have a running time yet.|`|AA10795350	Yes, his movies are all overlong. lol    I don't hate Michael Bay -- his brand of overcaffeinated, explosion-heavy action movies can be fun -- but Transformers and f-ing Bad Boys II did not need to be over 140 minutes long. Bad Boys II was at least 50 minutes too long, which is just obscene.

cy7freI8aa	Yes. All American music is a mixture of African Rhythms and Western Harmony (Western in the cultural sense as opposed to Asian, African, etc.). It began with blues and ragtime and grew in to jazz which was the pop music of the early 20th Century (think Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie). Rhythm and Blues is an older  than Rock and began in the 40s with artists like Louie Jordan and Paul Williams. It was simply up tempo jazz with the boogie-woogie piano feel. By the 50s guys like Little Richard had made R&B a more mainstream style. By the 70s funk music had incorporated elements of R&B and Rock and when kids started rapping in the late 70s they used break beats from funk records (some rock too, but mostly funk) thus conceiving hip hop.|`|lUe4rReZaa	No, it grew out of Rock and Roll.  Rock has been influenced by Jazz, but it came from of the mixture of American Country Folk music and African American Rhythm and Blues  .

I believe another time it wasn't on was because of the President's inauguration.  I just think the President has been speaking to the public on Tuesdays, which has affected the Law & order schedule.

Z8a1nCzUaa	According to the movie..(and actually, i'm pretty sure that this pertains to real life too) if you're the rule, you're the norm.  Chances are, the guy is REALLY "just not that into you."  You may think that he actually has feelings for you, he might act like he actually has feelings for you, but in reality.. he doesn't.  Basically, you're getting played.  Now if you're the "exception," then you're the lucky one, because he actually DOES have feelings for you.  He treats you like a princess, not because he's a player but because in his eyes, that's what you are! Alex's philosophy is that every girl wants to be the exception, but most girls are the rule.  So consider yourself lucky if you're the exception!|`|O00i9157aa	it means you have to break out of the mold.

A better movie might have been seeing the Predators or Aliens on their home planets, to see how they live on their home planets.|`|BJIo6twUaa	I wasnt impressed with both movies but i would have to say the first 1 is better than the 2nd movie. It just didnt hold my attention.  The first AVP, also has a rated R version out on dvd, i think the same goes for the 2nd (dont remember if it was rated R in theaters or not).    If they have kinda stuck more with the video games, it might would have been more interesting.|`|aMZLLoX1aa	Like all the people before me, hell yeah it was worse!!! In fact, the only thing that saved it frm its pathetic plot was the Predalien, a design I personally liked. The story is something even a baby could come up with, aliens crash, people in town get in trouble, Predators but in, and hours of 3d effects and over-the-top violence are unleashed.    The final battle scenes, which are supposed to be the climax was horribly ruined with sucky lighting. There are a whole list of production errors I couldnt even list (such as why our Predator used a blue liquid three times and still seem to have an unlimited amount)    In fact, its so bad dont even bother to rent the movie. If you really hve to, watch a friend's copy or something. Whoo. Ok, I've finished raging.

Has he told her how he feels about her?<br>  <br>  I've been in similar situations, men are pigs, they dont know what they have until its gone.|`|toLCaFc9aa	It has never happen to me, but I would sit down with him (again) and tell him how you feel and how you can resolve this. It may be best to let him go and follow the other girl and just stay with him as a friend, but that could be really painful for you. Its hard, just talk to him, but you can't really be with him anymore since he opened up to you and told you in your face that he loves the other girl. You have feeling too, and if he doesn't know how to appreciate your love and care for him, too bad. Then you have to let him go and hope everything will be ok. Good luck.|`|pvvNuOXlaa	My ex and I tried to work it out, but in the end, we split.  You have to do what is best for you.  I believe he is confused and needs help.

Good luck.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Its time to stop worrying about him and think about yourself. How can you be happy with him when he is in love with someone else and he doesnt love you. There is no future in this relationship and you sound like a very caring person, you deserve better|`|wDxSpwhtaa	he needs help. you need to get yourself a better life, move on and enjoy living.|`|xOiyuDataa	It'll be okay...<br>  I'd advise that you just speak with him... But to be slightly more straight forward, with all sensitivity to how you feel, if he isn't in love with you anymore, i'm not sure what else you can do... I guess it's very hard when the one you love, loves someone else, but we  have to come to terms with it so we can move on... If I were you, I'd probably move on. (it's harder than it sounds, i know...) but what else is there to to do...? It's gonna hurt, but i'd suggest you move on, and it will obviously take a while to get over him, but I am only suggesting this cause you said he loves someone else now.<br>  <br>  Hey, all the best. I wish you the best of happiness. <br>  <br>  P.S. about his depression. I guess there isnt much u can do about that either, cause you may have to leave him no matter what, cause you sau he loves someone else now. You can be there to support him emotionally, but I guess he is going to slowly move on to the other girl. Still be his friend I guess, cause I'm sure he needs you as he said.<br>  <br>  All the best. It will all work out.

The way she breaks it off is by going on a road trip with rory the weekend  of her wedding. Later when Rory asks why she's not marrying Max lorelai says "I didn't want to try on my wedding dress every night" refering to a story lorelai's mother emily told at her bacloerette party about the day she married richard.

8vGq6cRTaa	We do not know.  These tour stops are at small venues that hold 1000-2000 people.  We don't know if there will be any opportunity to meet David.  Big venues (like Idol tour and Jingle Balls) often have lots of security guards and barricades that can be set up to let fans meet the singers. At tiny venues (like a contest where 20-40 people get to see David) they usually do a table where David signs photos.  But these venues are in-between and they are all different layouts.    Also, since it will probably be cold out, David may not be allowed to meet with anyone outside (could hurt his voice for the tour). But you could try getting there really early and hope he comes out.  And you could try being one of the last ones out and hope comes back on stage.  Also if there are any guards or waitresses at your venue, try asking them. But basically, you'll know more after the first few concerts when you can find out if and how anyone else got to meet him.

eYi3nAZKaa	when you buy hair dye from shops they always supply really good conditioner that makes hair shine<br>  <br>  so i guess i'm saying that you should buy hair dye bottles just for the conditioner<br>  :P<br>   [it could work]|`|AA11609300	When your hair is damp, apply some BioSilk serum (just like the size of a pea).

But yes he is a good looking guy.|`|XOpuG1eWaa	Who hasn't seen it    and to the first person who answereed,  anyone that is a true twilight lover doesnt care about the "fad" it went thru!

One time i was watching MakeOver Home Edition and the kids and the parents got to go to disneyland and they met him and he was really nice to them.. but i wouldn't know personally. And Jamie Lynn Spears, what do you expect? She's a wh*re who wants all the attention and thinks she's the hottest teenager alive!

I met Steve Wariner and Ricky Van Shelton (country artists) and also got their autographs.    I also stood in line for the CD release and autograph signing of one of Ricky Trevino's CD's (country artist). I met him and got his autograph.     I've met Earl Campbell and have his autograph.     I went to the Dallas Cowboys training camp one time and saw Troy Aikmen (when he was still on the team) about 10-15 feet away on the other side of the fence while kids were getting his autograph. I have pictures of that.    In June of 2001 I went to a free promotional concert that the group Otown did in the parking lot of a local Walmart. After the concert there was an autograph signing inside the store and ,even though I didn't have a wristband to meet them or get their autograph, I went inside and got pictures of them from about 10 feet away.    I worked for Walmart in a different town in 2005 and one time the country artist Clay Walker came in to go shopping with his family. I wanted to get his autograph so bad! Unfortunately, the customer service managers said we should respect his privacy while he's shopping so we did. If he had come through my line to check out I definitely would have asked him for his autograph though. He's been one of my favorite country artists for a while now.     My brother works for an air conditioning company in Austin and a few summers ago he had to do a service call at Lance Armstrong's house. So he met him and one time Matthew McConaughey was there too. He didn't get autographs though because he was on the job.      I hope this helps. ?|`|aHz0jupVaa	the jonas brothers,  push play,  phil bensen  [:     all nice & friendly !|`|qOE7wBbFaa	OK ....

By the end of January, the stations will move from Clear Channel's Kenwood studios into the Centennial Plaza downtown complex for WRRM-FM (WARM98.5), WFTK-FM (96.5 ROCK) and WGRR-FM (103.5).    "The Bob & Tom Show" will stay on the classic rock station, but some WOFX personalities may not remain, says Karrie Sudbrack, Cumulus market manager here. The classic rock play list will be tweaked so as not to overlap with the 1970s rock hits on WGRR-FM, she says.    Automated Radio 94.1 - previously known as MIX and WINK - will be changed slightly to complement soft rock played on the more          * Have a Good Day *               ~ Don ~|`|pywffiyLaa	The actual radio station is still there.

One night,she runs over a child and, to save her own skin,blames it on the young black man who works for her. Her sister suspects something isn't quite right and questions him closely,convinced he's innocent. The film is,"In This,Our Life"|`|goe3y4FPaa	WHO EVER IS CUTER|`|80ehnLBJaa	That film is "In This Our Life" (1942) and it stars Bette Davis.  Her costars include Olivia de Havilland, George Brent, Charles Coburn and Billie Burke.  It's not a child, but a young man she attempts to blame.  Bette didn't consider it one of her best performances.  She thought she was miscast--too old for the part.  Bette--"It was one of the worst films made in the history of the world."  I've seen 80 Davis films, so far!  This is not one of my favorites.  But, it is a good film and a great cast.  My favorite Davis film is from the same year, "Now, Voyager" (1942.)

KWvGUoW6aa	This question could be answered in a number of ways. Technology has effected music in general, both because of the types of instruments that we are able to use, as well as the quality of the recorded music. It also has made it much easier to distribute music.<br>  <br>  Just think; back in the day, before we had electronic instruments, everything was acoustic. People would gather in little honky-tonks or speakeasies and listen to live jazz, because the live music was much higher quality than the recorded music. Also, big bands were popular because a smaller band couldn't even fill up a room. <br>  <br>  Then as the technology came along, microphones and speakers made it easier to project the music and fill up a large room.<br>  <br>  Also, they didn't have electric instuments in those days. Now, we have synthesizers and patches which allow keyboardists to produce any kind of sound they want. <br>  <br>  Finally, the internet has made it much easier to distribute music, and has made it easier for people to access free music. This is somewhat problematic because people can go on YouTube and watch music for free, so they are less inclined to pay for music. However, some people I am sure, still think that a live performance can't be beat, so they would rather go out and see a live band.

It started around the turn of the century and grew out of Ragtime, Blues, and the popular Marching Band music of the time.  It is a blend of Western and African music, and shares elements of both, It was essentially a marching band that used the African influence of syncopated rhythms, call and response, pentatonic scales, and improvisation.  It was primarily considered low class when it started, but gained popularity in the 1920's becoming the most popular genre of music by the 30's and 40's|`|yWcPOTsAaa	New Orleans, Ragtime.

Since he paid them off in a sense.|`|xDdmnf80aa	Because, I think, he wants to die in glory: in a bath full of money, because he came from nothing..|`|qE7Er3pRaa	duno havent seen it was it good?|`|3YIjKQTEaa	Because he realizes how much pain he's caused his own brother. I think after he see's His brother on Who wants to be a millionaire still trying to make some thing of his life even after all he's been through, he see's what damage he'd caused and that he was just a bad person but wanted to try and make a small difference before dying. He fills the bath with money so it's ruined and can't be used.     I think it's also a reminder of what problems money can also bring.|`|l0Ye97Hjaa	I thought he wanted to bleed all over the money and than they wouldn't be able to take it.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Money symbolized the way he lived his life, even though he finally repented. He was in a bath of money, because it's a symbol of how he lived his life. He lived and killed for money, and now he can't escape his boss except to die. So in a way, it was for money that cheated and killed and in the end was money that killed him.    In contrast, his brother used his experience of poverty to win money and to be faithful to girl that he invited in from the rain.|`|I5wje0J1aa	I haven't seen it.
h6NqNzHAaa	Truthfully, no. Most are very light weight and the brackets holding them up are too flimsy to hold the weight of a human. Ah, movies, not so realistic after all,|`|6CAsx3jaaa	mythbusters on discovery network had a show about this as well as other movie and spy stuff. one its too loud to do in secrecy and some arent strong enough. there are easier ways to do things. oh it also depends on the size and flexibilitity . getting stuck would be real bad|`|GgEcSKZ1aa	possibly but it all depends on the struture og the vents, the quality of metal and how big it is and you, but im pretty sure you could, i was watching a programme about myths and they made a vent they could crawl through. hope i helped|`|xXEFvl8Naa	big enough yes, strong enough no, except maybe for a small child, but it would be very noisy|`|x2cKYj10aa	It is possible but they are full of sharp metal edges and pitch dark inside.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Actually, most air vents are mounted on hangers that can not hold a person's weight, unless they are very, very small!|`|muul7LTwaa	Lol, i bet it'd be really dusty and full of Rats in Real life.  =D|`|TjNT6waaaa	yea absolutely i do it all the time honest to god..when their big enough that is|`|OdgDkTf8aa	i don't think so because it only carry's air
6rR7LTl1aa	That's...a fairly basic plot point, and pretty hard to miss...    To make it as simple as possible: Lelouch is a Britannian prince --  a son of the emperor and a late empress -- essentially in exile to "eria jyuuichi", under the alias surname "Lamperouge."|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Its both.    He's born in Britania, but he later moves into Japan, aka Area 11 with his sister and he lives with his childhood friend since then, Suzaku.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Lelouch is a prince of Brittainia. His mother was the Emperor's second wife. However, she was killed (and Lelouch's sister Nunally crippled and blinded), and considering how things were handled after that, Lelouch is convinced someone else in the royal family was behind it, and vowed to get revenge. A few people loyal to his branch of the family secretly took him and his sister into hiding in Japan, where they were believed to be safe from Brittania. But then the invasion happened, and Japan became Area 11.
dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	I am not a psychic, but it sounds like it is you that is hurting the most, and you are expecting and wanting him to call. It was probably him that called, but.......... It may have been real to him at the time, but he is not the real deal.  Move on with your life.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	The key word here is "was"  He WAS in love with you.  Your Capricorn has moved on, and so should you my dear.  It's never good to wait for anyone because you put so much out there that when it all comes crumbling down it feels like your life has just ended.  Try avoided that feeling by simply forgetting about this person because I really do believe that he has moved on. The signs are obvious.    Best of luck    ?|`|Zg6HG9Rvaa	No    Don't wait for him
Pzah4HCwaa	I think that woman's name is Theresa, if you remember way back to when Locke has that trippy vision of Ethan as a child, young Ethan kept saying, Theresa falls down the stairs, Theresa falls up the stairs. I think there is more to this lady than we know right now, (as in she was an enemy of the others and Daniel was ordered to harm her, and that is why Charles Whitmore is paying her medical bills in hopes that she will recover and be able to help him get back to the island) just a thought though!|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I think that Desmond saw Daniel Faraday's relatives when he was looking for Mrs. Hawking (Daniel's mom). The woman in the bed was Theresa Spencer, and the sister was Abigail Spencer. She really looked like Mrs. Hawking.     I am thinking that Theresa was probably a participant when Mrs. Hawking was experimenting with time travel at Oxford University. And I think that Mrs. Hawking has passed her life's work on to her son - Daniel, and that is why they think Daniel's experiment was the cause of Theresa's illness.|`|448ae9fe57ebcdd3c132783ccffaaf61aa	I am not 100% sure but from the way the guy at the university and sister spoke he moved her through time, which is why she thinks she is talking to  people that aren't there or have been dead for some time.|`|FrkF7PaRaa	I don't think it went on to explain it...but now Charlotte is getting sick (on the island), so we'll see if there are any similarites as the show progresses...!

ZhCJaXINaa	Season 1 of The OC blows everything out of the water. It was AMAZING. However, I feel like the OC started out amazing, and slowly lost its spark as it went on.     One Tree Hill has had some slow, lame moments, but overall - it has been able to maintain the greatness. Thats why its still on & the OC isnt.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	One Tree Hill definitely!|`|uDsXjzwjaa	The OC by far! It's soooo good. One Tree Hill seems too serious. The OC has drama and it's hilarious! Seth is sooo funny.|`|LcnSBvqWaa	OC|`|FBMZ388oaa	One Tree Hill!!  The OC had  horrible acting(:|`|vcsbfYOLaa	definately the OC.. exccept i didn't like the last season all that much..  but seth and summer are to die for! i love those two :)|`|YuDRtpsbaa	I

AA10378030	Not at all!!|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	i agree how many can they make,,,   it isn;t as good as the first one,,   come on movie makers wake up,,|`|kEqygf1gaa	i agree, there are not very creative any more are they?|`|FCcbgriuaa	They are running out of ideas so they seem to bring back the old and your right it sucks!|`|QT8vmBfsaa	Yeah i agree but in order for them to stop making them, people got to stop buying the tickets......there not bad but eventually the same theme gets old|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	i cant wait to see this|`|hnRHjTmzaa	Not in this situation with the Remake coming out.    It is great to get a new look on a HIT older movie.. The originally might have been laughable, but I think its going to be awesome to get a new view on this movie...    Kinda like Halloween. Rob Zombie gave it a new life so to speak. I find it interesting|`|e2990eb46d523c3852908ba44a7cff02aa	well, considering the last one was over 20 years ago.    not really.    If I were you, I'd sue your parents for everything they got.|`|80da5fab3a4a2253ef755ed76c79a7f2aa	no

The ending sucks more. He finally sees fat women for what they really are, yet dumps a good looking woman for a fat ugly chick. Only in the movies.|`|cAhEFilGaa	It's Shallow Hal.|`|0MrIptYDaa	it's shallow hal|`|pWeSEbhVaa	shallow hal
PeFyTHf8aa	Go that link for your moon sign. U need a birth time thats why i couldnt figure that out for u!    Your sun sign is: Gemini!   Your moon sign is: http://goddess.astrology.com/moon/signs....    *Gemini*    The third sector of the zodiac, Gemini is all about intelligence and communication. You're born under this sign and have a talent for and love of using your minds and expressing yourself fully.     As a Gemini, you are a bower bird, mentally, and take an interest in all sorts of different things. Anything that gets your mind ticking over will grab you. You constantly try to challenge your mental abilities and will make extra efforts to understand anything you put your mind to.    You cant understand why other people dont feel the same way. To you, this kind of stimulation is your life blood. Anyone who engages you in quick-witted and thoughtful banter will win your heart for sure.     Some great communicators are born under your sign  actresses Helen Hunt and Marilyn Monroe, for instance. Like them, you take interest in anything that requires a little brain power. Reading and ferreting out information on the internet are a perfect way for you to unwind. Communication would have to be one of your favourite pastimes.    Taking up acting classes wouldnt be a bad idea either, even if you dont fancy yourself as an Emmy Award winner. Meeting new people and sharing your thoughts and feelings with them is enough of a blast for you.    Not all Geminis have brains on the brain, though. Anna Kournikova, the tennis superstar, proves that  she puts her focus into physical exercise. She is a superb tennis player which requires physical dexterity and mental agility as well.     Gemini is also on the top of the list of achievers in sport. But the sport you get into will be one that requires a strategic and intellectual approach. If it doesnt, it wont sustain your interest. Tennis, chess, golf and card games like bridge and canasta appeal to you.    If you could be accused of anything, it would be that you spread yourself too thinly, by being interested in too many things. To some people, you seem superficial and flighty. Its the rolling stone gathering no moss thing  doing a bit of this and a bit of that and not getting deeply into any one thing.     You see it differently, of course. To you life is a smorgasbord, and youre going to taste everything. Trying just one main course, so to speak, isnt your thing. Variety, diversity and experimentation are some of your key words. And you can always say, At least Ill never be boring!     The fact that you take on so much also means you risk wearing yourself out and letting your vitality engine slow down. It is not easy for you to pace yourself, but if you can get your self-discipline working on this, you can achieve more than most. Make sure you have enough fuel in your gas tank to get you to where you want to go.    People always love your company  your adaptability makes you interesting. People are amazed at your versatility, at the way you manage to juggle so many different activities. Is there anything you dont try your hand at? They wonder.    Learning will always be one of your passions  you dont believe theres ever a good time to limit someones desire to improve their mind.    You have a great love of the written as well as the spoken word, and will often put pen to paper  or hands to keyboard  to get your own thoughts down. Sometimes this is just so you can work out what you think about a particular issue or event. Lots of journalists, writers, and advisers are Geminis; their way with words is their best tool for making a lasting impression.     You also have a strong connection to travel and short journeys. Youll often feel restless, and your itchy feet will set you wandering. These journeys may not be long, but there will be plenty of them  youre always on the go. You are thirsty for new experiences, and even on short journeys or in transit, youll throw yourself into meeting new and unusual people.     Youre fascinated by psychology and the way human relationships work, so you will seek a life partner who is as into communication as you are. You will need this sort of person if you are to achieve emotional fulfilment.    You are the type of person friends and relatives turn to for advice on their love life. This has an upside for you too  it helps you understand whats going on in your own life, romantically speaking.    Geminis seem to grow younger rather than older. Physically, you will maintain a youthful glow, and you will never lose your fun-loving liveliness. Youre really not into that 'growing old gracefully' thing.     Vitality and constant stimulation are what you are about. A peaceful old age is definitely not your cup of tea (even if you happen to be over 60).    http://www.astrology.com.au/12signs/gemi...|`|rnqgiRkWaa	http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...    go there and it will tell you everything you want to know about you its a really cool site.      The sign position of the Moon  reveals much about our habits, reactions, and instincts. It shows how we express, and deal with, our emotions. Most obvious in our homes or in private, our Moon sign reveals our innermost needs. Many astrologers feel that the Moon represents our experience of mothering; it also shows how we "mother" or "baby" ourselves!|`|GLDXjJfaaa	yes you are a gemini     do a natal chart to know your moon sign ect, cafeastrology.com is good.  for example ima gemini b/c the sun was in gemini when i was born (jun17) and my moon was in aries on june 17, the moon changes signs every two days or so, the sun changes about once a month.|`|L00xbCERaa	the m oon is who you subconsciously are. I have made a theory that the MOON sign is people really are and act like. The Sun sign is how people behave when they are consciously acting on something, but the moon is the inner behavior...... just google WHAT DOES THE MOON SIGN MEAN IN ASTROLOGY?.... mami and i'm positive that you'll find what you're looking for. Try this website for full explanations of your natal chart. just fill it out.....  http://astro.cafeastrology.com/  if you liked it, choose my answer as best and blow a kiss at ur boy here....

a1Ngi39Xaa	Well I am happy she was able to bring Victor back to Genoa City.  It's just not Y&R without Victor.  Who knows - she may have a few tricks up her sleeve this time now.    I did love it when he told Nikki off today...|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I know she is flirting with Mike. Why else would she have his son? YES -Tyler is the father, not Peter.    I know that Victor will end up shooting her-come on, why not? Ashley is so awful to all these men.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Well she will soon find that VIctor hasn't changed at all once it gets out about him buying Gloria's stock and Jill taking over Jabot once again, It is pretty funny that she has to make Billy CEO Jack is going to be furious but back to Ashley she believes that Victor truly loves her and is taking a different outlook on life by starting a family with her and that little snob Abby but really Victor is merely out for revenge in which I don't blame him Jack is going to get it that snake... Victor does care about Ashley but it's not going to last b/c he is using her but she is also using him just in a different way...|`|FwU6GL4Laa	Its just a matter of time, he will be on to something better. The sad thing is Abby will have gotten close to him by that time and will be let down hard especially after loosing her other dad (Brad)|`|AA11111233	I agree, who the hell is she fooling with this relationship.  I think she just has a point to prove with Jack about mixing business with pleasure, but I think it's going to blow up in her face.  If Ashley starts going against Victor and weaves herself a tangled web like Nikki did, Victor is going to verbally assault her just like he did to Nikki.  I hope she finds out for herself that Victor is incapable of truly loving another woman, especially one in his age range, because of his lust for power and greatness overriding everything else.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	She is going to get what she deserves.  Everybody wonders why Abby is so snobby...look at her mother, monkey see monkey do!  I think she already knows she is a rebound.|`|CyVxolNHaa	yes so true!|`|jpWtZUEqaa	I actually think its going to be Ashley that gets the last laugh this go round. Obviously, the answer to your question is yes. She is his rebound chick but Ashely seems more willing to stand up to Victor then she has in the past. I think if Ashely gets wind of what Victor is doing at Jabot. She's going to dump him this time.|`|e6793d500dfaf665df5882dcbf7f1223aa	okay well yes I feel that same way ashley seems to think it is going to be different from the last time . I dont think so . Once victor tires of her and abby they will be back in london again . I think abby is a stuck up brat anyway and ashley should know victor better than that .|`|ryEiHFOnaa	She is a fool and i don't feel sorry for her. She knows how he is.|`|5mAyW3Yiaa	I agree with Yasmin|`|msUIsv8maa	You never get so high you cant be brought down and when the truth hits her in the face shell wake up and learn from it.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	they could of left her gone and kept brad , but they want her and victor to raise abbey, but she is just as you say a booty call.|`|2O7hZT9kaa	Ashley Abbott has always been Victor Newmen's rebound booty call and always will be.  Every time Ashley gets into a relationship with Victor, she becomes very weak and dependent on him loving her but she only ends up with mental issues.|`|QwiGDmqAaa	ahahaa!! I couldnt have said it better myself! Dude I completly agree. Its so damn annoying... Nikki went crazy to help him and he chose Ashley, that made me sick.   And after everything with Nikki, theyre history, and love, and how she went to effin - mexico was it? w/e after she went all the way across the pond to find him, and bring him home, he acts like a selffish ba*****. And has the nerve to threaten her, ooooh oh if I was Nikki yo I'd be pissed as all hell!   I cant wait to see Ash and him break up. Shes been actling like a real cocking ****** to Nikki n Brad too. As nicey nicey she seems, you can just see the fakeness in her.   And might I add:: The whole brad situation is absolutly heart breaking!! Abby called Victor 'daddy' :( imagine being there seeing the child you raised run up and hug some next guy she now calls 'daddy' that really only shares DNA and money with ur lil girlie. i mean ugh i really felt fer him.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	The reason why l wouldn't feel sorry for Ashley is because she's a strong woman and l DON'T feel sorry for Nikki when Victor tells her to mind her own darn business!
61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	Not sure, but Megan from the other season was on Beauty and the Geek, Rock of Love, I love Money and God knows what else.........reality game shows are her life.|`|sOgLLlDraa	I don't think so but she  kinda has a girl next door look. Like you know her from somewhere, but really you don't. Maybe that is why you think she is from another show.    And out of all the girls from Rock of Love I think she is less likely to be in a porn! She won't even dance with her clothes on for Brett!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	yeah..a porn!|`|VxN6DJ54aa	She's an ex stripper so maybe you saw her at the club plus she's a groupir.

Small hands are  a turnoff...if u were 5'6 wit a size 12 and large hands then that may be more weird|`|8MF8Qf31aa	I find that a turn on if anything. If a guy with big hands holds me it makes me feel small and fragile and that he's big and strong. Plus it usually means other parts of him are big too. points?|`|AlgAS8gsaa	I dont see why they would be so bad, i'm 13 and some of my friends are size 11 and they're not a turn off! (but not a turn on.. cuz they're my friends.. lol!)|`|ADwKztGsaa	well you know what they say about big feet... ;-) haha|`|MInxGbvJaa	Hey big guy,      I'm the same size you are and grew up in the 50's and stood head and shoulders about the croud. I got along much better with the girls when they fou;nd out what esle was big. Ha--Ha so only date girls that are 5-10 or better.

9z5YJKqLaa	because the title basically spells out "F U C K me"    if you say  "If u seek amy" fast enough, you will realize that's what it says.    and on 1:00, if you listen closely, you can hear someone in the chorus say " love me, f'uck me"|`|CCYWYk3qaa	I think her play on words is brilliant! but yeah i can see why its 'controversial'...Love the song tho!    "All of the boys and all of the girls  Are begging to If (F)   You (U)     Seek (CK)     Amy (Me)"|`|G0NrzSwkaa	i did the same thing!    i was so confused.    but then i asked my friend.    in the lyrics it says 'all of the boys and all of the girls are dying to IF U SEEK AMY'    but what it sounds like is 'all of the boys and all of the girls are dying to F U C K ME'    weird huh?|`|3AMqLOBGaa	because the real title of the song is hidden so that's why it's bad so if you play the volume loud or if you say it fast enough then you'll know it really spells "F-U-C-K Me". parents want to ban it on the radio but it's not a bad song i love it i don't thinks there's anything wrong with it. it took me awhile to know it really meant that.
88621de6d733c17b5cb18c7075ff1b1eaa	well she doesn't say those lyrics but it might be the song "better".  i do think when i 1st heard this song i thought she was swearing.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Everywhere I looked didn`t have a definite date. Sorry.    Originally, only two series with a total of 52 episodes, but due to popular demand, a third series began filming in late 2008 and will screen in early 2009. Jonathan M. Shiff, executive producer, said that, "there is lots of potential for a third season with normal teenagers who have super powers," and that open water filming may be an option in addition to the filming done at Sea World and Broadwater. Indiana Evans will have a major role in the third series as Bella.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	I did a quick search and everything said 2009 but the exact date is still to be determined.

g2GogSALaa	On your keyboard, there wil be a "PrtScn" (print screen) key on the top kinda near the right.     Press that down if you want to take a picture of the window or tab with your meez in it.    Then, open the paint application on your computer and paste it. You can then crop out the edges and save it as a picture.    Then you can upload it to photobucket or whatever :]
68c3c675691a70f0baeeac4fbf98acfcaa	no way is she gone for good.  Somebody will develop re-animation powers or a new character can bring back the dead.  She is too good of a character to be just done!|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Tons.  The simplest is Claire's blood.  We've seen it bring the dead back to life before.  Someone could always retrieve Elle's body and give her a few IVs full of Claire's blood and she'd reanimate.  Then there's time travel + illusion - a time traveler and an illusionist could go back to when Hiro teleported Elle to the beach.  They hide her and Sylar kills an illusion of Elle.  In fact, a future version of Sylar himself (or Peter) could potentially pull this off alone.  It would be like Sylar to try and travel in time to undo his own sins.  These are just two ways of doing it that don't mess up the time continuum.  If you throw that out the window, there's plenty more possibilities.    Kristen Bell always said she loved working on the show, and she and Zachary Quinto are close friends in real life, so I'm sure she'd be happy to come back for a guest appearance or two if she had the time.  I wouldn't write her off just yet.|`|AA11357056	I think she's dead... except for Claire, the people Sylar kills usually stay dead.|`|6hFK44Bnaa	You make a good point, but usually they have healing powers.|`|mf2aSyB8aa	Sorry but i think she is defiantly dead. I mean people that sylar kills usually stay dead aside from claire of course. I liked Elle she mad sylar more human and i could relate to him better but now shes dead he's just another villain. :(    Sorry to disappoint you lol :)

Also till your Scorpio isn't really committed he probably likes and wants more than one girl... most of them are like that.     The best suggestion for you I think is not to be obsessed by him. Play hot and cold. And he will be the first one who will say that he wants to see you. This is a really good trick with them.|`|KABKMLnmaa	If a person reacts that way it can actually only have one reason: he's prolly not interested anymore. I know it sounds dumb but yeah... Scorpio's are like that. That doesn't even have to do anything with Scorpio or not it's in the human nature to be a coward. Maybe he just doesn't wanna hurt you.

RBW9ZX1iaa	It's false.  Bebop is a song but it is now considered a style of jazz. Originally derived from traditional jazz bebop was developed by players like Dizzy Gillepsy, Herbie Hancock, and even though he is not given credit, duke ellington, and of course, charlie parker. There are allot of musicians who played bebop and who really started the trend is unknown. One characteristic of bebop jazz is the augmented fourth which is more commonly called a "flat five". In classical jazz musicians look at the chords to tell them what notes are going to sound good and in bebop musicians look more at the scales to tell them what notes aren't going to sound good and how to resolve them.|`|jwrcHFglaa	False is the correct answer.  Bebop is actually the name of a song!  When Dizzy and Charlie Parker were getting hot in the clubs, a reporter came around to find out what all the excitement was about.  He was there, and they were sounding blazing hot.  He asked someone nearby what they were playing.  They told him "Bebop", which was the name of the song.  The reporter thought that was the type music they were playing.  After his article Bebop stuck.

That is how the director really wanted b/c in 4:3, they had to cut the sides out of the picture. In other words, in 4:3, you are always missing the edges of the scene that the director thought were important enough to incorporate into the film.

I wish we could open our eyes  To see in all directions at the same time  Oh what a beautiful view  If you were never aware of what was around you  And it is true what you said  That I live like a hermit in my own head  But when the sun shines again  I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in."

irSBrZiQaa	Will and Gwen adopted Sophie and Cole's baby. Gwen and Will allowed Sophie to see the baby, but Sophie started to over step her boundaries and Will and Gwen thought it would be better if Sophie stayed away. Sophie then kidnapped the baby and when she returned to Oakdale she tried to take custody back of the baby. However Sophie lost and and Will and Gwen decided to take the baby and start a new life.     Paul and Meg were getting along until Paul kissed Meg while they were spending time with Eliza. Dusty then asked Meg to marry him and she was hesitant at first, but Dusty explained that Paul would not leave her alone and that he really wanted to win custody of Johnny. Meg agreed to marry Dusty. Dusty got Meg a quicky divorce and they said their vows in Reno. Holden tells Meg that he was not happy about the wedding. Josie also is not happy that Dusty married Meg and not her.     Carly agreed to marry Craig, however Sage was not happy about it. Jack takes Sage to eat and they come up with a plan to stop Carly from marrying Craig. Sage tells Carly that she is moving in with Jack and Janet. Carly tells Craig she can not marry him because her kids are not happy. Craig talks to Parker and gets Parker to agree to talk to Sage. Carly's kids agree to the wedding and Carly agrees to get hitched. While at the wedding Jack shows up and Carly tells Craig that she can not go through with it. Craig is furious and tells Carly that she just wanted to make a show for Holden and Jack. He tells Carly that the loan is off.    Katie and Brad plan on making a baby.    Jade and Derek find out that Derek is indeed Jade's father.    Lily and Holden have a fight over Holden's interest in Carly's life.    I think that covers it...I hope I helped :)|`|RbLw8izTaa	okay so gwen and her husband will, adopted their baby hallie (whose biological parents were sophie and cole). but then sophie started to be so kida psychoish by always badgering them to spend time with the baby ans stuff, she even went to the point of stealling the baby and trying to get custody of her! so will and gwen got fed up and left oakdale, for it to be safer for the baby. but sophie died anyway so maybe they'll come back :]    recently:    paul: he is trying so hard to be a good dad to eliza, and keeps bringing gifts to the farm, but emma thinks he's phony so she is being rude to him. meg filed for divorce, and paul convinced meg to bring eliza to his house for a visit, and everything was getting along well until paul got confused and kissed meg. then meg started going all bezerk and stormed out.    Meg: she is so undecided about paul, because one second they get along, the next they are fighting. she is staying at emmas at the farm. and, dusty proposed marriage to her! she said yes, not trough love but so dusty will have a "Stable family" to convince the judge to give him custody of johnny. many people were uspet about the wedding, such as holden josie and paul.    dusty: he proposed to meg, and when craig tried to get johnny at his wedding, dusty ignored the calls and took him to his wedding with meg. dusty is being really insensitive to josie lately and not even being considerate to her feelings.    carly: she agreed to marry craig, but sage and jack disagreed, so they try to scheme to seperate them. but then parker convinces her to make mom happy so she goes along with it. then at their wedding, right before she says i do, carly leaves the room and all the guests, and calls it all off. craig is hurt and tells carly that he isnt going to loan her the money anymore.    katie: she was told by margo to got o the wedding, but instead she blew it off to try and get pregnant with brad.    jade: she finds out that casey and emily were together, and applies to be emilys new assistant, also derek is her father.    lily and holden: they are disagreeing about carly's choice to marry craig.

GS20sIkMaa	Have you any lyrics?, pretty hard otherwise.
dOurKVdiaa	I think they always talk about hip hop from 88, and how music now a days is garbage, and they aren't mainstream, they don't waste money on expensive jewelry, but they buy expensive clothes, and somewhere in there, they will say college is cool, and tight clothes are Okay cause Ye said so, and they never sold dope and dont want to......................................... I will let you in a secret, I sold dope in college and i still hit the books, and trust me there are people slanging dope right now on the yard, so get over it.|`|qpxPW5paaa	Someone who realizes that their music is going to have some kind of influence on the people who listen to it and tries to make that influence positive.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	A conscious rapper discusses topics that are relevant in society today and in his/her community.  They try to be a positive example.  Many half-step and talk out of both sides of their mouths.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	nas is an example    a concious rapper is a street poet who expresses political and goverment issues, as well as some religion|`|1sapXjMvaa	it's a fine line, i think.  i mean anyone can do some research and spit knowledge about whatever.  I think it's an emcee who has remained consistent, even through the "struggle".  Gosh this a rather hard one.|`|86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	I really don't like to use the term.  If I had to define it though, I would define it as content before I use the word to define an artist. Like you can have a "conscious" artist spit something about gun clapping and then have an artist who isn't seen as "conscious" spit something about religion, injustice, education and other social issues.     If there's a song and the artist is talking about social issues (like the ones I mentioned above), I see that as conscious.  They could be seeking for solutions or just acknowledge them. But when I think of conscious I just think of social issues or just songs with a "message."|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Conscious = Alert|`|bribxhsdaa	Aware. And that's not neccesarily having a mumia tribute somewhere in your discography.    Just an artist who makes you AWARE in a serious way. For example, "A Song For Assata" is a conscious record because it made me aware of a particular event and the injustice surrounding such events. I think knowledge is a part of it too...Awareness is fuelled by Knowledge of something. Especially knowledge of self.    EDIT - LMAO chuck. If i put on a dashiki and carried a free mumia flag, I'd be more conscious than everyone in this section. - The term can definitely have a weak connotation.  Although like "underground" and "political" the term has lost a lot of meaning -_-.     I hate labels. They fall off over time.|`|bik6rJZkaa	I define a conscious rapper as one who kicks lots of true facts, and often does not sell because nobody really wants to hear it, thus ever remaining underground or achieving very little public recognition outside of hip hop.|`|VclnZhSCaa	I'm not positive, but I know dashikis are involved.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	First person that comes to mind when I hear conscious rapper is Common. I bet he hates the label though!     I dunno, you've got your trinity of Common, Talib and Mos Def who seem to have the most famous "conscious" labels attached to them, so I guess by those standards, it's someone who discusses issues that are important to youth, and someone who maybe isn't afraid to criticise what they see as being wrong within hip hop.|`|NctYwdvhaa	conscious rapper is a rapper that focuses on the things going on in the world, and issues which are largely debated, and talked about, or even things which arebarely covered in the news as the media makes you believe what you hear. its hard to be conscious because to write lyrics and formulate ideas takes time. i respect people like talib kweli, mos def and a tribe called quest as they can cover more diverse issues than hoes, money and bling.|`|lMOXHh45aa	I don't. I think the words "Conscious" and "Real Hip Hop" tend to infer that Hip Hop is only supposed to be one way, especially cuz of the fact that people always like to say "Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, etc" when those words are mentioned ---EDIT: Chuck Norris' answer is serious ironically and i agree with his point... on the song "Yo Yo", Phonte talks about 'Coffee House N*ggas', dudes with sandals, and crochet hats and capris on (dashikis included). i think i posted a question on these sh*ts a long time ago but i cant post the link right now... maybe later

I just call it rock. Everybody nitpicks at what the hell is grindcore, metalcore, black metal, nu-metal. If it has a guitar and drums, it's effing rock.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	heavy metal|`|K8lxbOdqaa	hard rock/heavy metal|`|enIMNiCiaa	Slipknot is nu-metal. The rest lingers around metalcore and deathcore. In flames has two eras. One is Melodic Death Metal  and some classify their later albums (most noticeably "A sense of purpose") as metalcore influenced.    EDIT: Most songs with the whole "growling" "Grunting" "Screaming" and such, are most often thrown in as "extreme metal". Take great care as Nu-Metal is NOT EXTREME metal. There are people who stuff like that seriously and will shun you, even harm you, if you were to call  a band, such as Slipknot, Extreme Metal.     Not ME, but crazy metal heads. lol    But basically "Extreme Metal".  Extreme metal isn't really a list of its own, it's a term used to classify certain genres like Death metal, black metal, and even the -core genre (although some might disagree, it's still true) and others with "harsh" vocals.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Glam metal|`|AsXK0xD5aa	its all metal|`|IupDRUKnaa	Slipknot- Heavy nu-(ish) Metal  (i saw them live)!!!

0IKwusdgaa	Most likely - Gemini, Capricorn, Scorpio    Gemini - I was surprised no one said Gemini becuase most suiciders ive known have been Gemini. They have mental issues even if it doesnt look like it. They rule the brain and they need alot in life which they know they may no always get. They need way too much variety, freedom and they need to go out too often and alot of people dont realise that. Its just them. I actually know alot of Geminis like this.They are also immature and impulsive that they could try to commit suicide and they actually wont know what they are doing. Plus life itself can become so boring for Geminis if they dont get the fun.    Capricorn - Very depressed. All the time practically. Puts herself/himself down all the time in work, socially, love, money and family. Since childhood they have known to have depression and throughout their whole life it comes and goes. They are however very mature yet life can become very depressive especially if they dont get a good job, love life or friends.     Scorpio - Although known to take revenge, life of a Scorpio can become so full of hatred that they can start to hate life. Eg. a betrayal of thier partner may make them go crazy and because they are very emotinal inside because their love for a person remains foreve rand they will take revenge however, but they will be so deeply hurt inside. They are able to anything and if they revenge is too bad, they have the ability to destroy themselves. They never forgive nor forget. They dont forgive themselves either...they are also like caps a very depressive person.    Least likely - Aquarius, Saggitarius, Leo    Aquarius - Loves freedom, however can manage to be fixed in one place. More of likes difference than change. Forgives alot and forgets easily. Will consider EVERYONE as their friend and wont take things seriously. Will enjoy life. Does not expect alot.     Saggitarius - The optimist of the zodiac. Maybe to an extent. My best freind is a true example of a Saggitarian - i tell her my problem and she goes into deep philosophies of life and human nature and she even said ''by heart everyone is good. Its just that some people dont know or they lead life the wrong way''. A bit hard to believe for me but she also said ''No one changes'' and it was sort of true to me becuase you are still the same you and your outside will change but you wont. I am also a Saggitarius Mercury - haha expect me to talk about this. Anyways, they also like Aquarians, love to have fun and dont take things seriously. They know the value of life and what really is life....they do.. they just wont say it.    Leo - Another optimist of the zodiac. Yes they are vain and have alot of expectations, but they also are very happy inside and out! Ofcourse know one is happy all the time and i can tell you, Leos reading this will be like ''No way'', but they hardly get depressed. They are vert clever and they are not dumb. Im not talking about studies but in life matters they are very clever. They are good by heart tot usually even if they dont seem like it and its just that they themselves so much - which is actually what most people need in themselves. Because they like themselves - why would they kill themselves? They also love other people too and alot of people misunderstand that with Leos and of couse there are different types, and even if they are very proud of themselves or not they have self respect which many signs dont.|`|srInWygoaa	i say that the water signs are   most likely to commit suicide   like capricorn and cancer because  they're more emotional,  but that'ss just my opinion.|`|AWC9OcQ4aa	i hope none of them = ( ?|`|d1kz6b17aa	I have no idea.|`|AA10160596	Cancer.|`|AA11573305	virgo is most likely and a cancer is least likely.|`|hu7qfGHzaa	Perhaps, water signs because they are are so emotional.|`|zZZVNXnvaa	i think a virgo would commit suicide.  and less likely is a cancer because cancers are sly and are hard on the outside so they cover their soft insides.  people think they are weak bu the are quite the opposite.   but i feel sorry for the insecure virgo because the are very hard on themselves and are too egoistic to admit it.|`|AA10768706	Pisces female ( my old best friend was a suicidal pisces)|`|v4M5u6sWaa	google it|`|LuTjBw4Laa	ummm i don't really think there is one haha and very random question but sorry im not sure what the answer is try to ask someone who is a major in that.

Althought they can be surrounded by people who are secretive quite often.  if a Scorpio feels like there is missing peices of relationships and they need to know something, that can really distract them and drive them off course.  Scorpio always needs to stay in the loop and be self aware.  Even after an emotional "trauma" but then thry will find it difficult to just move ahead, they need to re-evolved as the Phoenix.    It's best when a Cap is very well trusted amoung thir circle of friends and family.  when they are they will never think of taking a plunge.  Most signs aren't known to be the most suicidal.  But I've read somewhere that one of the the most unfortunate degre in the zodiac is 15 degrees Leo.    It's always going to be harder on a person if they aren't experiencing a lot of what parts they are lacking in the chart.  you tap into that which isn't obvious to you and you begin to learn a lot about yourself.  Suicide is very very unfortunate and never needs to happen.  Before one just takes the leap they need to do some intense self learning and decide to trust in others and the life around them.  if you don't see the beauty and what makes life so worth while then keep looking.  :)|`|ixW2NREBaa	In my opinion i think its the gemini because they get depressed a lot.  Like marilyn monroe was a gemini and she was always depressed...soposaly|`|nstyHYliaa	Most likely: Capricorn, Virgo, Gemini    Capricorn: This sign is ruled by the planet Saturn, known for being melancholic, unfortunate, and perplexed. Capricorns are said to be highly ambitious and determined. This is true. Capricorn represents the zodiac energy pertaining to taking on several challenges, and gaining lessons from those challenges. Because of this, many Capricorns may find themselves dealing with particular misfortunes in life, or hindering life obstacles. Capricorn is a dual natured sign. They represent earth and water, the earth side being the side of triumph over the obstacles posed to the Cap by Saturn the Tester, and the water side displaying the end of failure. Capricorns will find their lives full of ups and downs, as they repeatedly succeed and fail. Their personalities are not naturally cut out for these kinds of roller coaster lives, as they much prefer stability and predictability. The sign of Capricorn is representative of a vicious cycle of life's torture devices being faced toward a person who needs a bump-free life. It is likely for a Capricorn to resort to suicide as a means out of this hectic cycle.    Gemini: Geminis are ruled by Mercury, the planet of the mind. This can manifest itself in the Gemini in a positive way, or a negative. Typically, its both at once. In the positive, Mercury's influence is one of creativity, intellectual brilliance, and uncanny optimism. In the negative, Mercury can bring the Gemini crashing down to earth only to find all of their bright illusions of the world shattered. Geminis have a heavy zodiacal burden placed upon them: it is their duty to deal with life's opposing forces and introduce them to one another. These meetings of opposites can complicate the lives of the Gemini and perplex them, causing them to constantly question everything. Also, out of the Gemini's hands is a tendency for the brain to be wired improperly from the get go. This is an inevitability, caused by their Mercury rule. Gemini being the first mental sign of the zodiac is dealing with the fundamentals of brain development, and that means right from within the womb. Gemini are highly prone to nervousness, anxiety, emotional discord, overly-complex self analysis paradoxes, and much more. On top of it all, they have the impulsiveness and self-persuasive abilities to convince themselves into something such as suicide.    Virgo: The other sign dealing with Mercury, Virgo is in a similar boat to Gemini. Virgo catches a break however, as they are not nearly as prone to mental wiring malfunctions. Instead, the Virgo malfunction lies within the conscious mind and controllable circumstances. Virgos have the power to make anything become reality; they are by nature masters of control. This is why there are two distinct types of Virgos: Virgos who are so on top of life that they appear seemingly flawless and perfect, and Virgos who are so in control of the chaotic aspects of life that they appear as if nothing is in their favor. Again, Virgos have the power to make anything a reality. If they choose to obsess over not being able to control the personalities of others and every fatal aspect of life that occurs around them, they are going to enter into a self-defeating spiral of over-analysis and laceration. A Virgo is highly capable of making or destroying themselves. It is because of this that a Virgo can be prone to suicide. At the same time, they can be prone to endless fortune and enlightenment.|`|gJvwdPs1aa	id definately say cancer. iyoh we are maniacs believe you me, im talking from experience, but never got to the finish line.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	I would have to say Scorpio, Virgo, and Pisces.  Scorpio because I have read that they have a self-destructive behavior.   Virgo because they are too hard on themselves and sometimes can have a meltdown.  Pisces because they can become depressive and alcoholics.    Least likely: Sagittarius and Aires because they are optimistic and look at the bright side of things.|`|AA11404315	i just paid all my property taxes today.....its most likely gonna be Capricorn!lol|`|sWwugT91aa	I think it's the pig that is most likely to commit suicide, and a mouse is the least likely.

And, yes I am a believer in astrology. We all have free will and we also have a mind of our own and make our own decisions. Everybody that is born under the same sign as someone else will not always have the same traits, characteristics, and personalities. Other factors to whether people want to commit suicide or not need to be taken into consideration such as what problems the person may be having, whether their extremely depressed and so on........ Our zodiac sign plays an important role but it does not dominate us and has nothing at all to do with suicide. There was just another question the other day were it asked if it were true that Sagittarius people were more likely to commit suicide. (I'm a Sagittarius) That was the first time I had ever heard something that crazy, but I answered with the same thing I'm saying now.|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	Most Likely: Scorpio or a Virgo.    They can be so hard on themselves,in different ways.    Least Likely: Sagittarius or Gemini.    They're both so ridiculously optimistic,they don't stay on the negatives for long at all.

At7iKpONaa	http://www.lyricsreg.com/lyrics/road+ham...    due to the lyrics, i believe that he is referring to a homegrown country girl. he doesn't want any city folk, he could have a bunch of different girls on the road, but he wants a girl that is homegrown.|`|6abd3bdb56caa5b55d37adf04ec88a38aa	Well, if you're speaking in referrence to weed/pot then "homegrown" means they had their own plants and grew them on their own property.    Homegrown could mean farmers who plant their own produce in a garden. Corn Crops, Tobacco fields, tomatoes, potatoes. etc...        hope this helped. I haven't heard of the artists/songs you mentioned.|`|sa6J59elaa	In Texas 'homegrown' means a country girl, farm girl type. "The Real Deal" according to some of my fellow country folk!|`|AA11352641	Usually when people say "homegrown" they are talking about marijuana that people grow at home.
Al3ZjFZWaa	I'm not crazy about either, but I'm going to pick Zeitgeist because there's a couple songs I like on that album ("Tarantula" and "Doomsday Clock"), as opposed to none on AG.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Oh wow.  I'm going to ahve to say American Gothic.  Both are good, but the songs on American Gothic are amazing. I love Sunkissed and The Rose March.  The amount of songs on Zeitgesit don't compare to the four on the EP.    How can you not love United States?|`|yknytmO3aa	the smashing pumpkins!!|`|vDjy1eKDaa	the Pumpkins fu*king rock..nothing is better than the other with them.

Then, I would say Zeitgeist.|`|yS61H04haa	I am going with American gothic too. I really didn't like Zeitgeist at all. Honestly, I haven't listened to the whole thing , it is just that bad to me.

h1yGVkkfaa	Rob zombies Halloween wasn't a remake it just focused more on micheal myers and showed what we didnt know,But one is better and that is John carpenter's|`|nceIGfCBaa	One is god awful and the other is fantastic.  Zombie's Halloween is just a slow, predictable mess.  One of the biggest things about the original is that Michael is the seemingly normal suburban kid who just snaps.  Zombie's Michael is some white trash nut headed for crazy town.  Probably the worst thing Zombie does is spend about an hour with Michael's being in a psych ward.  Just skip and stick with the original.    DRAGON 2012  "Great fortune for U.S."

yIcQOEnuaa	The last time we saw Claire after she walked off in the middle of the night was in the cabin with Christian and Locke at the end of season 4. She said not to worry, that she was ok. But we don't know what exactly happened to her. Hopefully this season we'll find out..|`|JCdBSULraa	The more interesting question is where is Aaron supposed to be?  The fortune teller made sure to do everything he could to make sure Claire raised Aaron, and told her never to give him away.   Ben says they all (presumably Aaron included) have to go back.      Yet Christian (who supposedly sides with Ben & the island) said Aaron is where he's supposed to be, and (dream-version) Claire said not to dare bring him back.  At this time though, we know Claire was last seen with her dad (Christian) in the cabin.  Formerly, she hated her dad and didn't even want to know his last name, now she's suddenly buddy-buddy with him and appears to be high.|`|sXpGfHWWaa	I have NO idea, I am so scared, but I like Kate with the baby, not Claire.

Dz29uzaMaa	i think your right with the last album but you just have to watch the bands website and other sites for news. i know a lot of bands take a long break in between albums. like metallica for example they released an album in 97 and didn't have a new one till 03 then it took another 5 years before their next album came out. so just keep an eye and ear open.

RusCWuUlaa	Yea i think they highlight bad parts too.They do the same thing with maddie. it's because it makes the show more interesting and gets more viewers. i mean who wants to watch perfect family with a perfect mother and perfect father and 8 children who are saints. People love that she looks crazy and that Mady can come off as a little brat. i mean i personally think Kate is amazing and a wonderful mother. they probably like to highlight the bad things more than the good because that's how they make money. i mean in no way am i saying that they are script because i know they are not and trust what they say when the only editing they do is dialogue and that is only when they can't understand the kids.    but also you have to remember they are being real to us and letting them into their homes. she may come off as a b-itch but the important thing is she is a devoted wife and a loving mother. not to mention someone said that she has changed from the first one hour episodes.... we really didn't even know them then! How do we know kate wasn't just keeping her cool because it was a one time thing and she wasn't really comfortable. And they was she treats her husband is between them two. obviously jon doesn't mind because she has been like that ever since they were dating... they showed it in one of their shows.|`|AGbusTqGaa	You know I was watching that show this afternoon and whats with her not knowing how to shop?  Is she seriously that dependent on her husband?  I know its not the easiest thing to be in style all the time but you can at least pick out your own clothes.  Its not hard to match!|`|ujomB7iHaa	i do know what you mean.like on yesterday's episode she told the kids they were not allowed in her room because she wanted privacy and anyone who came in without knocking would be 'severly punished'  and i don't think you should do that to your 4 year old kids|`|Fgkr8P0paa	i dont think she is. she is just stressed.|`|qe0RNp7xaa	She has 8 kids under the age of 6yrs old. I think she's allowed to be a strict mom who knows how to handle chaos.|`|u48M55Acaa	No i think it's probably really stressful having eight kids i mean seriously think about.|`|69f74f3454bd6423f3d58ce955f6f59aaa	i'm starting to think she is too  at first i loved the show and i guess i still do to some extent ... but her ocd crap gets old - ENJOY your kids and stop worrying about every little stain or mess  i mean i totally understand having to be organized with that many kiddos but that is not what being a parent is all about|`|czY7K8yKaa	I don't think she is, she just tells it like it is.  She doesn't hold anything back and sometimes I feel sorry for her hubby.|`|zwrB1apbaa	she is just stressed out. she has 8 kids and they are very young and though she is a bit mean to her husband bcuz  like when i watch the show he looks at her when they talk and he looks really offended but shes like that bcuz shes jus stressed out. She has to do lotz of things. If you were her i bet that u would be the same. all stressed out and watev|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	I think she's a bearcat myself. I wouldn't want to be her husband. She scares me.   LOL|`|QSUg9vNLaa	She so is not. Shes stressed. If you had 8 kids all the same age I'm sure you'd act the same.|`|7uB42JzJaa	For all those who think that having 8 kids gives you the right to be bitchy towards your husband on tv..take a look at Michelle Duggar she has 18 YES 18 kids and you don't see her belittling her husband on tv..|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I think she is. Especially after that whole deal, where she said Aunt Jodi couldn't get paid for being on the show because it wasn't her family. Lame. She's really rude to jon too, and she seems to have extreamly high expectations for everyone in her life.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Do you have kids??  Or 8 for that matter.  I know she can say some mean stuff to Jon but, come on she is at home everyday with 8 kids.  You would be a little irritable too.  LOL|`|YAiKlPkMaa	I don't know about her remarks to Jon but I have noticed a change in her since the show has been doing so well. They get big expensive family vacations, keep upgrading homes, have you seen the newest one? Now they have a book making money as well. I think the "fame" is going to her head. Look at the old shows and you can see a big difference in her attitude.|`|956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	On one of the promos they have her looking out her kitchen window saying "This is all Mine"  That should tell you what she`s like!!!  No wonder, check out the house.    http://s424.photobucket.com/albums/pp329...|`|oO4TUkVkaa	I think that unless we have been in the same situation we should not judge the actions of another individual.  While that being said some episodes do show a bad side of Kate but we all have our not so pretty side that we may not want people to see.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	She is a bit of an obsessive compulsive I think.  Jon is like that, too, I think.  It's just how they roll.  I like that they are honest and don't try to sugar coat how they act.  Nothing is quite how it seems not matter if it is real life or TV.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	I know what you're talking about. "The Soup" constantly shows clips of her being a ***** to her husband, i don't know if there's alot of editing or if that's just how she is.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Man, she is a SHREW!  But they have the scam down and the dough is rolling in.|`|HbaxtX44aa	you got kids?how about 8 of them?id would be ...itchy to.|`|0fbb5e27ed4790306bd5062233798e68aa	I really dont know if she is that way. She does have 8 kids but so does Jon. I know if you look back at the very first episode when the babies were tiny and it was called something like surviving twins and sextuplets she did not seem that way. Maybe it is the money that makes her act that way. You have to admit even to the audience she seems different then she did back then|`|CApnEZ83aa	Yes, she is.  Everyone says that she is stressed with 8 kids and that is why she talks to Jon like he is a dog.  I have 5 kids and I don't talk to my husband like she does to hers.  Stress is becoming an excuse to talk to people rudely.  She has changed and it is all about the money.  If you notice, all of the people that used to come over, don't come over anymore.  I think she is greedy.

HFqiY6BGaa	The best way to do it is to buy software. If you have a mac get istopmotion. I have it and it is amazing, easy to use and goes through the isight.     I would suggest taking individual photos on a tripod.     You can take my advice because i know stop motion movies. here is mine:|`|a3C6DeNeaa	For any specific questions, you should check out http://www.stopmotionanimation.com  It's a message board filled with stop motion animators helping eachother out. They even have a handbook section that has basic answers and info on a variety of stop motion topics (armatures, sets, cameras, etc)    http://www.stopmotionanimation.com/handb...      AnimateClay.com also has some good beginner tutorials:    http://www.animateclay.com/index.php?nam...        To actually frame-grab and compile the movie, I'd suggest using Monkeyjam if you're on a PC. It's free.    http://www.giantscreamingrobotmonkeys.co...    AnimatorDV: Simple+ became freeware.    http://www.animatordv.com/download7      If you're on a Mac, you could try Framethief or FramebyFrame.    http://www.framethief.com/    http://web.mac.com/philipp.brendel/Softw...    If the videos by Patrick Boivin are the ones you're talking about that look like they have a lot of camera moves going on, he takes hi-res digital still pictures so he can create zoom ins and zoom outs and camera moves afterwards in a motion graphics program.|`|nbcUK2IOaa	The way they did it in Nightmare Before Christmas, was just taking single frame photos.  I would use I tripod so it looks more professional, or not as shaken around.|`|OBemKKwoaa	How could it look continuous without using a tripod? What other way are they keeping the video/pictures still?|`|e71MWgJJaa	get microsoft movie make and i would record whole thing first then edit it and movie make has all these cool effects and sound effects.|`|0agU05WKaa	The best way that I find, is taking individual pictures. It makes it easier to edit. I, also love taking stop motion. I highly recommend using a tripod. Makes it easier by not having to hold a camera, it won't be shaky, and the frames won't be off center.     hope this helps. =] happy film making ^^

Both cover version are superior to the original one.  original    STEVIE WONDER/ SYREETA- Cause we've ended as lovers    cover 1.  GATO BARBIERI  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41GV4MP84...

Well you might be bored of me showing this one but I can't help it...is my favorite cover!    Holy Diver- KSE  http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=-zSsESxSq5...    and Disturbed's cover of Land of Confussion  http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=dKFIedvbAi...|`|6EoAKcMwaa	I liked it, but I prefer the original. The flute in the original is what makes the song for me.    My favorite Tull song is either "Teacher" or "Locomotive Breath"     as far as covers go, it doesn't get any better than Sonic Youth covering the Carpenters  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRiyN_Zn5...|`|u8ia6oKxaa	I like alot of covers but since i just listened to this song    Vintersorg: Rainbow Demon  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHoWhHE2X...    cover of Uriah Heep  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eku0Pg3c5...    I think its a pretty good cover|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Paint it Black by the unseen|`|srtoPxN2aa	I really enjoy both bands versions a lot, for various reasons...different sub genres etc. Though when it comes down to it, I'm definitely a bigger fan of Jethro Tull's version.  Iron Maiden has covered many artists songs over the years, here's a few...  I included the Tull cover again, as it's a different video that the one you posted... :)     Golden Earring's - Kill me Ce Soir:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1V6Z4Ju_...  UFO's - Doctor Doctor:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-ql9C_it...  Led Zeppelin's - Communication Breakdown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuJR91Y8M...  Stray's - All In Your Mind:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-UbMToDe...  Jethro Tull's - Cross Eyed Mary:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzZSyN_Cb...  Nektar's - King of Twilight:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFU1FFmY5...     Here's the original version of Nektar's 'King of Twilight' from 1972:  http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...    Here's the original version of 'All in Your Mind' by Stray:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=lAoveiet_0...  Youtube does such a p*ss poor job of reproducing proper 2-channel stereo, which is evident after hearing this! Lol    I guess the above covers by Iron Maiden are OK, and a nice homage to the many bands Iron Maiden grew up with, but I'd much rather hear the originals. Though their version of Strays 'All In Your Mind' is quite good.  But when it comes to Iron Maiden, I'd much rather hear their own original music. I feel the reason they cover these songs is for personal enjoyment above all.   As a collector, I own all of these Iron Maiden covers, either in EP vinyl format, or singles...picture discs. They're quite collectible now.     *Here's one of my avorite cover songs of all time...    Black Sabbath - 'Evil Woman'...this song appeared on the UK and German pressings of their first album back in 1970 on the original 'Vertigo' spiral label. It was omitted on the US release at the time, but was made available again on more recent subsequent US CD reissues...  http://www.imeem.com/ladytaximom/music/F...    Here's the original version of 'Evil Woman' by late 60's-early 70's   Minneapolis hard rockers 'Crow'...  http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...  .

Although, your lower notes are really nice and soulful, and maybe if you developed that a little more you could learn to carry that bit into your upper register.  I would not try to change your voice to sound likes other peoples, because in the end you'll probably end up hurting yourself.

I thinks its cause she's so super skinny or something.      I will have to admit that I did used to have somewhat of a girl crush on her though.  But Jennifer is sexy is a strong independent way.

nkSjYEoraa	yes i guess, me (aries) boyfriend (scorpio) gets along just fine. aries are known to be selfish and immature and he understand me. he is the most understanding and passionate man i knew. hehe good thing he lets me decide in the relationship or else.|`|A3dQS6k2aa	scorpio female is too foxy|`|XD249UxNaa	Y? and no my mums aries and we dont get along xxx|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Not the best match but with the right positions it can work out.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	I'm an aries and my hubby is scorpio. We have been very happily married for 21 years this april and I can honestly say we are extremely compatible. He is very supportive, logical, rational,patient and keeps me grounded. I on the other hand am more impulsive, more nurturing, creative, expressive etc. Between us we make a good team. We each know each others strong and weaker points and have faantastic lines of communication. Due to this and understanding one anothers needs, we have never had a proper arguement in all the time we have been together.  Hope this helps.|`|1ATIcoYYaa	humm there both Mar and Both competitive|`|c0XomxxEaa	I get on with a couple of scorpios and Im an aries.. it never seems to be flirty with them thouhg, or sexual, i think just as friends?|`|369vsqhgaa	SUN SCORPIO-ARIES       You are both willful and passionate people, with a strong desire to live intensely and directly, and you love this about each other. There is a lot of fire in your relationship and you are likely to fight ferociously sometimes. ARIES, however, can release anger and emotions and then forget about it, while SCORPIO nurses grudges and resentments, and may hold on to the wounds that ARIES unthinkingly inflicts.    Also, SCORPIO needs to feel intensely bonded emotionally, and ARIES may not have the same overwhelming need for closeness.    SCORPIO AND ARIES COMPATIBILITY     Aries has an odd effect on you. The Mars of Aries and your Pluto can coincide with frustration. Aries is Fire and you are Water; the two do not mix, which is not to say that the relationship cannot succeed. What it does indicate is that there are problems, more so than two individuals might normally expect to encounter. Aries natives could irritate you. You sympathize with their goals and their desire for independence. In sympathizing, you feel you should do something. But no matter what you do, you feel it is not enough. This creates a guilt feeling, followed by irritation. That's why the relationship could be described as odd.    Aries affects that part of your solar horoscope related to work, health, and the ability to harmonize with co-workers. Aries affects your employment, your ability to rise above your environment. With an Aries, you work - and enjoy it. You perform services. Aries helps you in a steady manner, is not sensational, but reliable. With Aries, you might feel bogged down, buried in details, surrounded by red tape. You get impatient. You could act impulsively, pushing logic aside. Both signs possess a keen desire for independence. Both tend to be dominating. Naturally, this could create problems. Diplomacy is essential in any association with Aries. Otherwise, conflict results, followed by animosity and a breakup. With Aries, you get the job done and have the courage to overcome obstacles. It's not easy, but it can be done. It depends on the individual maturity of Aries and Scorpio. There is attraction. You are drawn to each other. The problems can be overcome. It is worth trying!         Generally scorpio being a water sign will get along best wth water signs(cancer and pisces).However apart from the astrological side i have seen relationships working between signs that are not so compatible.|`|jNiCHwamaa	Not at all!|`|rnqgiRkWaa	i dated a scorpio and im an aries.. there was nothing wrong with the relationship and we got along great   the reason i left was because i was stupid and took my ex back.   it really matters a lot about your other signs though. moon, Venus and exp mercury.  find out both birthrates and birthplace and go to http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/  its an awseome site!|`|3QpAqd1xaa	very very compatible. the scorpio is sooo patient with aries, but makes sure he is a resolved one, else they will use the aries|`|ADZgFvozaa	Hell no!!!  Stay away from Scorpio Aries!|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Me and my other half make a very passionate couple. I'm Scorpio he is Aries. Sure we fight but who doesn't in a relationship. We both love each other to bits which is what we both need. As for Leo and Scorpio being the best match as was said above, all i can say is LOL, never...|`|Oeih95lbaa	YES ARIES AND SCORPIOS IS THE BEST COUPLE OF THE WORLD  THEY ARE VERY ROMANTIC COUPLE|`|Zg6HG9Rvaa	yes     But Not a great deal    some times there are problems    Aries are best with Leo,     Scorpio best with Leo  and Pisces and Cancer
dn2tsXlBaa	They're making another one????? OMG tell me when its out|`|FDt7cC8haa	It is only a rumor...thank goodness....A second movie would ruin it....|`|nbcUK2IOaa	I think it's a rumor.

jfEb0tIJaa	They are not signed up with ITunes.    They figure their art should be purchased as a whole (Albums).      Being able to purchase just a couple tracks of oh lets say Lataralus would be an absolute injustice to the album and to the listener|`|reNnLWh4aa	they want you to go out and buy the cd. the last one had 3d goggles attached to it with a weird artistic flip book... it was totally worth buying it|`|MhowmBl9aa	I know! >:-(    I had to download them on LimeWire.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	They aren't? Have to check that out. I had a difficult time finding King Crimson.|`|dkgTuPOQaa	itunes doesnt have all artists. it has to do with their contract with the  record companies|`|4tynRVpzaa	Because they are a god awful band that nobody should have the misfortune of listening to.|`|hdrIaMF3aa	try Preferences|`|BaP8blh7aa	I love Tool.    Best bet is because the members do not want to be on there. 90% of itunes is filled with mainstream filth and dollar hungry scumbags - which the members of Tool are against.|`|F2QtzNyXaa	why that's weird|`|vSavIbboaa	tool doesnt need itunes. they dont sell it on itunes cause when you buy they cd, it comes with such amazing art that wouldnt come with a mp3 download. go out and buy 10,000 days, and see the amazing artwork that comes along with the amazing music.

I just can't live without you     I love you, I hate you, I cant get around you   I breathe you, I taste you, I can't live without you   I just can't take anymore, this lack of solitude   I guess that I'm out the door and now I'm done with you     Done with you, done with you, done with you, done with you,done with you     I feel, like you don't want me around   I guess I'll pack all my things, I guess I'll see you around   Its all, been bottled up until now   As I walk out your door, all I can hear is the sound     Always... always... always... always... always... always...   I just can't live without you     I love you, I hate you, I cant get around you   I breathe you, I taste you, I can't live without you   I just can't take anymore, this lack of solitude   I guess that I'm out the door and now I'm done with you     I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you     I left my head around your heart   Why would you tear my world apart?     Always... always... always... always...     I see, the blood all over your hands   Does it make you feel, more like a man?   Was it all, just a part of your plan   The pistol's shaking in my hands and all I hear is the sound     I love you, I hate you, I cant live without you   I breathe you, I taste you, I can't live without you   I just can't take anymore, this lack of solitude   I guess that I'm out the door and now I'm done with you     I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you   I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you   I just can't take anymore, this lack of solitude   I pick myself off the floor and now I'm done with you     Always... always... always...|`|lftPAXs6aa	saliva- always|`|iEvlbsXDaa	Always by Saliva.. also when you hear a song that you like and you don't catch the name of it but you do know some lyrics go to google and type in those lyrics, and after you type that type "lyrics".

Do you see he was dressed up in ashley's winter boots. He is gayer than anything ever. He said on E! that he made out with a guy once. He dresses like a diva. The eye liner,tighter pants than those jobros pants. And fall out boy sucks!!|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Could have something to do with him dressing like a woman.  Then again, I guess there are plenty of straight dudes who do that too...    This bra strap is killing me...|`|VFc9leFmaa	He kisses boys, wears tight clothes...   he said he's "not gay, but a fag" (because he doesn't mind kissing boys)  of course he's not he's happily married...to a woman ^^|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	I have no idea why people think that.|`|LNeOI1jHaa	eyeliner!!!|`|Gc4mSSNOaa	haha i know but i guess people think he might be because of the way he dresses but i think hes cute|`|3xhAbMIwaa	I know he's not gay. But the reason people think that is because he's a Cross Dresser-that's a fact, not my opinion|`|iifRGCGFaa	jealousy maybe...  or people are just hating on him  cause he wears eyeliner and has long  hair....  that's just STUPID...      he is soo hottt..|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	whats that suppoused to mean http://www.dailystab.com/blog/wp-content...|`|c4ffad35613c491307cfe58a126f710daa	er. no coz just he were guylinr and tight pants =D the Anwers Is No!!

Screw him and his shallow pop outfit.|`|q2cRdOV6aa	Um isn't he married?|`|bgh5aOGHaa	Because he said if he wasnt married/in a relationship he would go after guys|`|30GBdziuaa	idk, theres a lot of people who think he's emo im guessing and most guys who think another guy is emo is most likely gay -.-    stupid homophobes|`|r2TDtSAdaa	They think he's gay because he wears skinny jeans.|`|IfHCSlbSaa	he's not gay but its the guyliner|`|GePHMUZuaa	uhm  maybe because he wears makeup  and tight pants  and is part of THEE GAYEST BAND EVER|`|IwTsime2aa	He is not gay! I may be african american but i freaking love him .Isn't he married to Jessica Simpson's sister|`|n7paTJ82aa	Yes he is.    ;)|`|lShJ6S8saa	maybe because people haven't realized that a man who's wearing tight clothes using eyeliner and hairstyle products MUSTN'T be gay. they have a special picture of a gay in their head (like using make-up) and if they're seeing somebody fitting into that he's called gay. same is with the singer of the band 30 seconds to mars Jared Leto, since years the people say he's gay although he has affairs with a couple of FEMALE celebrities..|`|w1OG27LHaa	I really dont know.

I will say, I would do some research as to what is going on in  the plot this season (season 7) before you start watching it.  It's not the kind of show where you can start wathcing at any  point & still know what's going on.

aIZfiU6Kaa	Claremont has got it about right, Matt almost except the word mod had not been coined yet.    The word comes from the Edwardian era because the clothes were of similar style.    I lived through that exciting era in the late 50s and early 60s, I had the haircut and the Elvis records, the tight trousers were called drainpipe trousers.    I call it an exciting era because before Elvis and rock&roll the charts were full of Perry Como and Doris Day songs.    EDIT: Sheilah your confusing Teddy boys with Teddy bears.    EDT 2: Neneite having lived through the period and enjoying a drink myself, I can tell you that they were not renown for fighting outside pubs, there was much less fighting in those days because the pubs closed at 10.30, so did any off- licences and supermarkets hadn't been invented. It's ten times worse today when  fights also include young girls which was unheard of then.    EDIT 3: Thanks Sheilah, I'd forgotten about the brylcreem, I used to get through a jar a week, awfull stuff but it did keep long hair tidy, when I was in the RAF we were always known as the Brylcreem Boys.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Teddy boys were the names for young men in the late 50's early 60's.  They always wore thick platform shoes, their hair was always slicked down with Brylcreem.  They always wore suits but the jacket was slightly longer then the usual man's jacket and could be in a bright colour.  They were supposed to carry flick knives and be tough men!  Not all were like that, it was just a fashion and all the young men if they liked that fashion wore those clothes. Oh yes they loved Rock n Roll especialy Elvis Presley.  They never went around on their own they were always in groups, nothing wrong with them they were not out to cause trouble.  If you have ever seen the pop group Showwadawaddy (I bet that's spelt wrong) then that's what a teddy boy looked like.  I may be wrong but I seem to think the name Teddy came from an American President but I am not sure.    Edit - thanks to Ron he is correct it is Teddy Bears and not Teddy boys that got their name from a President.  Well I was half right with the Teddy bit!|`|GQoEDVhSaa	You have to be 13 to post here and you're clearly too young.|`|tlgJrKoRaa	teddy boys were in the 1960's, they dressed in long coats, funny shoes and listened to rock and roll.

It's basically a style, such as metallers wearing gothic style clothes and chavs wearing tracksuits and caps to look like rappers.|`|dyQNG6V8aa	The British Teddy Boy subculture is typified by young men wearing clothes inspired by the styles of the Edwardian period, which Savile Row tailors had tried to re-introduce after World War II. The group got its name after a 1953 newspaper headline shortened Edward to Teddy and coined the term Teddy Boy (also known as Ted). The subculture started in London in the 1950s and rapidly spread across the UK, soon becoming strongly associated with American rock and roll music of the period. Although there had been youth groups with their own dress codes called "Scuttlers" in 19th Century Manchester and Liverpool[1], Teddy Boys were the first youth group in England to differentiate themselves as teenagers, thus helping to create a youth market.    Some groups of Teds formed gangs and gained notoriety following violent clashes with rival gangs, which were often exaggerated by the popular press. The most notable was the Notting Hill riot of 1958, in which Teddy Boys were conspicuous within racist white mobs who roamed the area attacking black people and damaging their property.[2]    In the 1960s, many Teddy Boys became rockers.|`|39wcLSoPaa	i have know clue. I'll keep checking the question. And to Loddi  she said she was 14 your either retatrded or your humor sucks|`|34elYDjZaa	Teddy boy was a name given to a cult of teenagers who lived in britain in the 1950's. They were different from other teenagers mainly because of the way they dressed I think that they based their style on the American rock n roll singer Bill Haley. They liked American cars, rock n roll music, motorbikes, wearing suits with long jackets thin collars without vents, narrow legged trousers cut short which showed their socks (which were sometimes florescent coloured). The trousers were known as (drainpipes). thick soled shoes sometimes made from brightly coloured sued, (known as brothel creepers). They wore their hair long but well greased combed into a quiff at the front and a da at the back. They were also renown for having fights mainly after coming out of the pub on a Friday or Saturday night.

I think the unlucky factor might be based off of other signs such as Saturn/Jupiter.|`|plBXp91Daa	I don't think that every sign/human being is born unlucky.

Their healthy and have great relationships whether with their partner or friends. If a Leo woman happens to be unlucky or it feels that way it has nothing at all to do with her being a Leo. Being lucky or unlucky has nothing to do with our zodiac sign because trust me I have seen some lucky and unlucky people from every sign in the zodiac. But in all honesty we have all felt unlucky at some point in our lives. Nobody has a perfect life. Even the ones with money and power still have problems because were all human and things happen at some point.

Um i love looking at quotes so i know some cute lines like how shes the last voice you want to hear before you got to bed and the first to wake up, also try comparing her to something beautiful like the sunset or the morning ocean or idkkk a flower things like that, well i hope this helps some:)|`|UDX3qgy5aa	When girls listen to guys music, they want to hear about how smitten he is, in a cute way.

She loves my cliche's, bed of roses  wet with kisses,   always takes her breath away.|`|roFGlldOaa	I'd finish it off with:    She's such a romantic,  she needs a happy ending  i don't want to escape all her love  she's something to admire  she's my hearts one desire    or something like that.
dn2tsXlBaa	Isn't it about gay guys?
RrlXWz2uaa	I've not actually heard anyone describe her in those terms, however if you have, then I will take your word for it.  She was (as you are probably aware) in Liberty X and she is good vocally.  If you take what you have said literally then you could ask yourself why Britney Spears could be described as a "Pop Princess" perhaps?  I mean, have you heard her singing live, she's rubbish!|`|UlLpPuOTaa	Couldn't agree more...and she's a face like a chimp. But she's not bad on the ice though....|`|AA10652430	Shoot, I musta 'MISSED SOMETHING'.  WHO IS JESSICA TAYLOR???    *Goes to Wikipedia*|`|63joYeAtaa	i agree with you shes not worth the hype|`|fb0319752815c0e125149b667bb593e3aa	They have to describe her as something. It makes the show important.|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	I'm not sure. Suppose it sounds better than "average singer in a has-been pop band".|`|Um8osMNuaa	lt may be the only things they can think of to describe her, sounds better than has been singer desperate for a comeback!
gwI5SQ6Iaa	i think he's played by the same guy as the other living son. i don't know what his name is but i think it's him bc when you see the son who gets killed in the very beginning he looks like bobby but with facial hair and a suit. that's what i'm going with. there is a chance i could be wrong though
3FnhJluuaa	the real question is     why do people ask the same questions all the time?|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Because they are ugly, gay and sing like constipated llamas. Why do we care about who they've done concerts  with? Get a life and stop sticking up for your precious Jonas Brothers (who by the way, don't even know you exist and probably don't even care)|`|5wUmIuWvaa	cause they have nothing else better to do! :]|`|m4bdHnKKaa	wow you are totatlly right i hate people who hate them for no reason because i love the jonas brothers!!!!!!  but i think people dont like them because they are on disney and stuff...      but you forgot to mention that they write all of their songs and they dont lip sync!!!    and they are so devoted to their music because they even recorded their album while on their tour in a bus|`|GilxwZ2Haa	Because a lot of fans can go out of control, and they find us annoying in addition to not being a fan of their music, as well as the fact that they are part of disney, because apparently being part of disney automatically means they need to be hated. Everyone has different tastes in music, but people who hate the Jonas Brothers can go overboard and insult not just their music, but their fans, their looks, even their religion. It's getting pretty bad. I don't care if people don't like them, they just don't need to be so rude about it.    I love them, who cares what others think. They know who their true fans are  :)?|`|vwTyihvvaa	Cause I do not like their music.   I do not hate them, just hate their music.|`|ietpvuWfaa	Because the majority of their fans are thirteen year old girls.|`|FPxXiabNaa	I don't hate them because of some of the reasons you stated. There are worse bands out there who are milking the industry with no musical talent whatsoever.    But.......    I would guess that people don't like them because their music doesn't break any boundaries. It's been heard before a thousand times in various forms. People need to be excited by music and they bring nothing new to the table.    That goes for a whole lot of the music scene today, not only the Jonas Brothers.|`|9nYifIn4aa	I LOVE THE JONAS BROTHERS!  I really want to meet them!|`|uUtEXy5paa	First off, I don't "hate" the Jonas Brothers.  I do, however, despise them.    One, they have absolutely no talent.  Most of their music is edited or during their concerts, they have backup guitar players and whatnot.    Two, they are not "hot."  Teen Hottie does not mean anything special.  It only means that pre-pubescent teeny boppers think they're cute.  They were never titled "World's sexiest men" because they don't appeal to adults.    Three, they did not become famous until they were on Disney.  Therefore, Disney did promote them.  And because Disney got them on their feet, it'll be very difficult for them to rid themselves of the "pop" attitude, which most kid stars deal with.  And eventually, they get influenced by the pressures around them and...viola!  They're hasbeens.    Pretty much it.|`|w1OG27LHaa	I definately agree with you!  The Jonas brothers have worked so hard to get to where they are.  From having 10 people showing up at a show to having thousands....its great!  I think people need to stop bashing them and live their lives.  At least the Jonas Brothers are true to their roots and are really down to earth!  Like for example when joe broke up with taylor swift people are making such a big deal out of that.  Making Joe seem like hes a horrible person and hes not.  Life goes on and at least Joe didnt lead her on. He got a clean break. The way Taylor goes on about that breakup makes her seem really spiteful (im not a fan of hers). It seems like she actually wanted Joe to break up with her so she could make some dumb country song out of it, and try to bring down Joes reputation.  Well thats all my opinion. I really hope the Jonas Brothers will stay true to themselves and keep rocking!  (AND TO ALL PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THINK THE JONAS BROTHERS CANT SING, THEN PLEASE POST A VIDEO OF YOU AND SHOW US ALL HOW ITS DONE!)    Hope i helped...  x|`|aHz0jupVaa	yeah i dont understand that either .|`|jEAc6zqNaa	I have no idea why people dont like them.    They have nothing beter to hate on teenagers which is just sad.    They dont value our (the fans) choice of music    They are jealous cause they arent talented like JB are        GO JB

0e7266bdbdd21e052decd3cea66b6971aa	I, too, have never heard of  the Melody brand and suspect it is a cheap foreign made instrument. As the man said, you get what you pay for with a new guitar.  If you can't afford even $100, you will be disappointed, I'm afraid, with any new guitar you end up with.    A better alternative would be to search for a used guitar in good condition. Many music stores carry used instruments and e-bay is full of them. If you can find a used Fender, Washburn, Ovation, Ibanez, Epiphone/ Gibson or Yamaha in your price range, I'd go for it.|`|HBK9aIhxaa	Melody import their guitars from china which is why they're so cheap, and there are a lot of good reviews for the quality of chinese-made guitars now.   Melody themselves have a good reputation for value-for-money. The old adage of "you get what you pay for" is not true in this case.|`|7r8WT1Daaa	42|`|lKpHd1yOaa	Ive never heard of melody.

UNLESS, you're between the ages of say 18-25 and really "in shape". Then they'll think you're probably a dancer (or some old school gays might think you're a hustler... =^/ ). Which in that case, I say get up on that stage for a couple of minutes and make some money!! =^)|`|HR6KILFAaa	no its kinda weird|`|gZbGTXtbaa	Only At A Gay Club, Hell, It's Probably Preferred.Easy Acessability, Ya' Dig?

cuxRq4MOaa	I don't think he is lying if he is thats a pretty sick thing to lie about  In a realy life situation I would support Amy's decision to give the baby up for adoption. But for the purpose of the story line to the show i don't think it is a smart move i mean whats next after that ?|`|t5qfaUtKaa	i don't think ricky is lying and amy should stay with the baby|`|s2A4r4mVaa	I don't think he's lying.  Molly Ringwald: Children don't lie about being sexually abused. It was kind of odd though after keeping it a secret from everyone for so long that it came out so easily when he told Grace's parents.  Amy probably will keep the baby.  If I were in her position I would, especially if a pedophile is looking to profit from an adoption and would you really want someone raising your child who makes deals with pedophiles?|`|b45f30c0867fea80e5d7466a60a66b6eaa	he is not lying because Adrian's Dad(who is a FBI kind a guy) admitted that was true  i think amy is going to keep the baby|`|yNz8Hn4Caa	i thought rickey was lying until he went back to jail. idk. but for tv's sake, i bet amy's gonna keep the baby. how can they go on with more seasons if she doesnt?|`|2bf3VvLPaa	i think ricky is telling the truth, and i think amy will put the baby up for adoption, but i think that a family they know will adopt it like maybe Grace's family or something like that.|`|vvTrmHtxaa	i think ricky is telling the truth and amy should keep the baby.    please pick me as best answeR!|`|YqrvlbY1aa	i think ricky is lying because he tell every else a different story to try to make them fill bad for him so i think hes lying.    i dont think amy should keep the baby she should find the baby a good family because she has no help and no money so if she cant take care of the baby its better for the baby not to suffer and she should find the baby a good happy home

Nick Bollea was released from the Pinellas County Jail on Tuesday morning, October 21, 2008. He had pleaded no contest in May to causing the crash.    Bollea was arrested last year after authorities say he sped on a busy street and crashed his father's car, leaving a friend and former Marine permanently disabled.    Bollea could have faced five years in prison, but the victim's family requested a lesser sentence.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Yes. He has been out for some time now.

AQUARIUS IS INDEPENDENT AND LEOS NEED AND WANT THEIR EGO STROKED TO MUCH.|`|dqw1iH6haa	I'm a Leo Male woooooooooooo!!!|`|YhYapmbIaa	well, I don't know if they are a good match, what I do know from having dated a leo (I am a girl) is that they are fiery, some are difficult to get along with cause they are very set in their ways of thinking and they are not very good at expressing how they feel, they just explode in a moment of anger, but again, people are different depending on the way they were raised, maybe the leo that I met was just an @ss in more ways than I knew. Yeap, that is it! Lol, but Leo is a fire sign, they are also good in bed.   Love   Pearl|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes Aquarius and Leo are a good match. Opposites attract.    There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig. He is a Aquarius and I am a Leo.|`|Zg6HG9Rvaa	Yes    But not the best    Best is     Leo male and Aries Female|`|u6xS3eeGaa	Aquarius Woman && Leo Man    A true yin-yang combination that plays like a good game of Truth and Consequences.    For Leo: The polarities usually attract passionately, nevertheless the Water-bearer's expansive interests and higher mind leave you feeling somewhat neglected and unimportant.     For Aquarius: You are polar opposites. The is plenty of chemistry, however the Lion is more physical in nature then you are. You on the other hand are concerned with the intellectual aspect of the relationship that is often lacking.     Aquariuss tendency to criticize will deflate Leos ego and that is one thing Leo cant stand. Aquarius is too independent to become Leos devoted subject. No go.     This match is great for a short-term fling, but dont count on it lasting very long or leading to true romance. A Leo boy and Aquarius girl will have very strong physical chemistry, so you could be drawn together by that. Unfortunately, you are opposites in practically every other way and you will dislike each others personalities when you get close. You are interested in the world- you like to get involved in things, you like to philosophize about things and youre interested in justice and social causes. Meanwhile, he is completely into himself. Hed rather look at himself in a mirror than look at whats going on outside his own self, and he has not interest whatsoever in making the world a better place to live in. You will not be able to put up with this for very long and things will end in a big fight. Not a good love match for you.     Aquarius girl and Leo boy have unique talents and attributes to share with each other---and a great gift for creating an atmosphere of joy when together.  Respect is the key to success with this astro combo-know that you may come from two totally different worlds (and have different friends and interests) but this makes things exciting and widens both of your worlds.|`|MQO2cEeSaa	Yes very good match.

It's really not that hard.    But okay, I'll oblige and give you.... the melody.  I assume you know when it goes up and down, and when the rhythm changes and stuff.  I'm not giving you the left hand because it's hard to write down what notes happen at which times.

z5GwTXx6aa	Twilight without question!**|`|RVWyPicKaa	Harry Potter, although the movies do not go with the books. But because I have not seen the Twilight movie I can't judge (the books drag a lot though)|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	If you would've asked me this question about two months ago I probably would've said Twilight. I, like many other people, sunk into the Twilight obsession. I read all the books twice and I saw the movie twice.     But I have to say Harry Potter. The books are better written, they have a good plot, and the characters are so much more developed.|`|F44b2np9aa	Harry Potter is better written and the stories themselves are more engrossing, though they are a pain to read out loud! Twilight saga are excellent books, but I feel a lot of the hype is due to the sexual tension within the novels, and they are therefore nothing similar to Harry Potter!    I do not feel it is right to compare the two as they both effect different audiences. My ten year old nephew loves Harry Potter as I do, but he would never read twilight - But i Have!    A better comparison would be -     Harry Potter to His Dark Materials Trilogy    Twilight Saga to Naughts and crosses???      They are both great anyway - happy reading:)    Oooo. movie wise HP 1-3 = AMAZING 4+5= so so  Twilight - is ok, not as good as the novel.|`|oFTbqICiaa	tough call    twilight has romance, but harry potter has awesome.    books=harry potter    movie=prob twilight|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	dammit...this is like the foourth time i've seen this question and my answer is still the same.     they both suck but hp sucks less|`|fQjDF2uhaa	Twilight!|`|Igyp0mB1aa	*cough*cough*use the search bar*cough*cough*|`|cKuHXJQyaa	twilight.  i just got drawn in with the twilight saga.    but with harry potter is was boring to me.|`|fpvCBd8Maa	Potter kick @$$ books|`|WoYx41OAaa	I LOVE TWILIGHT BOOK BUT I LUV HARRY POTTER MOVIE|`|CuX1RLp1aa	Harry Potter, screw those vamps.|`|itEVkvdcaa	harry potter.  even though the twilight books are really good, i go back to read the harry potter book over and over again. twilight really didn't catch my eye like harry potter did when it came out. even though i was like.....in 6th grade, it still interested me more that anything and i stuck with it all the way to the end.lol im still waiting for the next hp movies to come out. all the movies were really good as well as the books so a could have to say harry potter was better. the twilight movie was a disappointment|`|ofI2ikiuaa	I've read everybook in both sagas and  harry potter is definitely beter XD

6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I literally grew up with Beyonce and Destiny's Child. I remember when their first song hit the airwaves. I'm not going to lie I used to be a hater. I remember the whole kicking members out of the group for not allowing her father to manage them thing, and it's a little fresh in my mind. I don't know her as a person so I can't judge on that, I can only judge her on her music. I wish Beyonce would return to her R&B roots. It seems, with this last album, that she's more popish now. I know it makes more money and I do like the CD but I don't feel as if she's really an R&B singer. I think Pop fits her voice more because she has an accessible voice that's light and airy. I do think she is trying really hard to do something different with this album and even though I do like it, I feel as if it's not really her. That she's only trying on a new sound to make more money. I wish her well in her life and her marriage, but I think she's starting to lose what made her somewhat unique back in the day.|`|eb22666f22d3e2e99ff47d3780843d75aa	nope. i use to like her back in the day years 98-01but then she just became a hoe..selling sex and all. also she seems like shes dumb. i think her voice sounded better back in the day but now all she does is shout and ****. also, she seems fake to me...and i think her father is treating kelly and michelle wrong. beyonce is overated to me..there are so many female artist that deserve the type of hype she gets..for instance, brandy (brandy had beyonces fame and more back in the 90s and early 00s but shes been having a lot of problems lately) keyshia cole, monica, mya and a few others    beyonce is overated and needs to fall back.|`|mZcdC90Uaa	The fame has gone to her head and I just don't respect her any more. She is like any other female star trying to whore themselves to sell sell sell. I used to like her music and now it is all just stupid.  Stefani|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	i love beyonce! my dream is to take a picture with her but that costs $1800.  some of her songs are amazing. her vocals are amazing. her performances are amazing. her passion is amazing. her ambition is amazing. her beauty is amazing. her dancing is amazing. her style is amazing. being her is fabulous. i actually loved her when she went solo. i disliked destinys child very much. beyonce can have some annoying songs like halo but overall she is a truly gifted artist.     all you haters love to hate her bcuz she is perfect. there are many artists out there who dont deserve fame like rihanna, miley cirus, taylor swift, katy perry, pink, alicia keys, mariah carey.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	I like her. Her voice is beautiful.|`|4wFbQH53aa	i like her music, but not her personally. she talks crap. she was like *well i didnt grow up like the jacksons, my family had money and we lived in a big house* she said something like that about the jackson family. i was wtf how rude!|`|ryEiHFOnaa	She is ok..|`|D27mJKmWaa	I like her...      1. Because she's a brilliant singer  2. Because she's a brilliant performer  3. Because from what I've seen, she seems like a very nice, classy lady!|`|7f4de88ac4442c220b7c4da3e9a1c739aa	i do , because she's hot ...... i dont like music much|`|KABKMLnmaa	Kinda used to like her when I was a lil younger but now I don't do really anymore. In my oppinion she's just trying too hard to get some attention.|`|GaouUtGTaa	I like her music and i like her as a singer too. I am more of the person that likes hip-hop,pop, rappish, and all of that other good stuff =D. I like her cause of her music and etc..But i luv her!! ? ?

zetxxZWUaa	It is good, really scary if you watch it at night by yourself. Basically a demon possesses a little girl's body and a couple of priests have to try and kick it's *** without hurting the little girl. However, even though it's an excellent movie there are many parts where it's a little offensive (for example: the possessed girl pleasures herself with a cross while yelling out some, well, aweful things about Jesus.)    Really Good though.|`|nmbbG0vdaa	its pretty effed up|`|AqXadhUzaa	Alot of the film ISN'T scary. It's toward the end it begins to become a horror movie.    Plot:   This famous actress' daughter finds a ouiji board in their loft. After playing with it, she begins to become ill. Tummy bugs, fever etc. However, her illness becomes sinister, as she starts behaving eratically (urinating in public, masterbating with a crucifix, deepened voice) Soon, her mother realises she is posessed by the devil, and seeks spiritual help.    It's not that scary in my opinion. But, I don't scare easily. Its certainly origional and you wont see a horror movie that reaches that standard for years !|`|ZxrWOyNVaa	hillarious  girl becomes possesed by the devil,  she goes evil  can turn her head round and round  watch it

DUg1IkTIaa	In my area, abc aired  Season 5 Episode 2 of LOST (from the LOST Premier show) as a re-run. It had the "helper" captions at the bottom.   Then they showed Episode 3 "Jughead" (about the bomb).   I think the episode just adds more questions into the already complex series of events.   I was hoping to see more of the story line about Ben and Jack getting the others returned to the island.|`|aLIVdFtoaa	actually tonights is episode 3 called "Jughead"    not sure what's going to happen?|`|JCdBSULraa	Was Claire's mom at Christian's funeral a ghost?(she was terminally paralyzed)  Is the "time police" woman Ms. Hawking(sold Desmond his engagement ring, and spoke to Ben last episode) connected to Faraday?  Will Hurley's ketchup shirt and the lack of a gunshot to the "murdered" man exonerate him?  Will we see the Cerberus system in action again? (smoke monster)  What faction was it that was trying to dismember Juliet?  Is Richard Alpert going through different time lines like the losties, or does he just never age?  If the later, how does he have so much understanding of the future?  Will bringing Penelope to Oxford expose her to any danger from "the Others" or Benjamin Linus    Oh there are so many questions that would be nice to be answered.     The only thing I predict is that there's going to be a lot of action when they try to get Hurley away from the police.   That or it won't even be addressed in this episode, in which case we'd learn a lot about someone's past (Dr. Candleguy perhaps?)
OTFzJbaMaa	the beatles were so innovated for their time and honestly very amazing song writers.    the who * i havnt heard much of them but im a rock fan and i recognize what they did for rock music in general*     jimmy hendrix did a lot for gutairists.    led zepplin.. because their.. well.. led zepplin. you cant really explain it further theyre kinda a mix between the beatles great music and hendrix hard rocking. * im not saying you mix those 2 bands together you get zepplin but its just kinda meshing the best of both worlds together*    i think nirvana * hate to admit it* but did alot they brought grunge to the mainstream. aic is still much better tho =)    pink floyd has a sound that was completley uniqe    and black sabbath did so much for metal it is hard to start.      favorite band is alice in chains  also adore motorhead and black label society|`|8jd2AHJdaa	The Beatles  John Lennon  Pink Floyd  David Bowie  The Who  U2|`|Ou6yW1r5aa	The Beatles  Jimi Hendrix  Ozzy  Alice Cooper  Manson|`|4qakEiXeaa	Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry & Elvis: brought then incipient Rock & Roll to the mainstream.    The Beatles: Changed pop forever. Probably the most influential band in this list.     The Beach Boys: Helped introduce the concept album with their Pet Sounds record.     Jimi Hendrix: Left handed genius and most emulated guitarist in rock history.     Led Zepplin & Black Sabbath: Brought a harder brand on rock to the masses.     The Velvet Underground: Without these guys alternative and punk would not exist.     James Brown: He isn't the Godfather of soul for nothing.     David Bowie: The man is innovation personified.     Pink Floyd: Took the concept album to a  whole new level.     The Ramones/ The Clash: The daddies of punk.     Joy Division: The fathers of post punk and new wave. You wouldn't have U2, REM, The Cure or newer bands like Bloc Party, The Bravery and Interpol without them.     Bob Dylan: Social critic and songwriter extraordinaire.     Nirvana: Brought indie bands and alt rock to the mainstream. They WERE grunge.     I love the Beatles best. :) Bowie is a close second.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	The beatles   Jimi Hendrix  Led zeppelin   Black Sabbath   Sex pistols  Nirvana     My favorite band is Nirvana.|`|7dbWSo9xaa	1.

I guess I would start with Buddy Holly, Bill Haley, Chicago, The Beatles, The Doors    and from their I could name countless bands and I would need lots of time to put it all down.    My favorite bands are:    Porcupine Tree  Nightwish  Pantera  Pink Floyd  Tool   and again I could go on, and on, and on, just like the energizer bunny!|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	Black Sabbath supposedly was the first true metal band. (they're ok)  Metallica is certainly one of the most influential (they're badass)  Then metal took a messed up demonic turn with Slayer (they suck balls)    Hard for me to choose one favorite, but I like AC/DC, Metallica, Lamb of God, and Pink Floyd

r3gh7ho7aa	Usually, grade 1 takes longer than 2 or 3 because you're learning everything pretty much: the scales, the notations involved, dynamics, chords, and SIGHT READING :D (everyone's favorite!).  Since you've been playing for a while, you're probably familiar with these things to a degree... but this is where it gets beaten into your brain :)    Grades 2 and 3 are applying everything you've learned basically.  Grade 4 is where you get into the real music!  But when I was grade one, I remember I had grade 1A and 1B, each with a completely different set of books!  Therefore, grade 1 is like two grades of work.  After you get over the initial hurdle of grade1 however, things get faster.     So if you're practicing diligently for 45 minutes a day, six days a week, I am confident that you should have no problem getting past grade 3 by the end of 2009!    Albeit, I think my course might have been different than yours.  I had Alfred books, and they called them "Levels."  Perhaps levels and grades are not even the same thing :O.    I stopped using the books after level 4 and I've never been a fan of the "Grade" system for instruments and I'm not that familiar with it.  But I can only speak for my own personal experience, and I hope it helps!    Best of luck!!|`|kF2TI78kaa	i started piano at age 8.  it took me almost a year to finish my first book.  your goal is a little high,because i have completed 5 books in 3 years but  2 books were level one (different series) and 2 books on level two.  im am working on another level 2 book called John Thompson's Something and it is pretty hard.    but in theory i am in level seven.    but then again,im only starting middle school|`|VYkKfCGZaa	Usually it takes 1 year to accomplish a grade, just like School.|`|HGdq8GHyaa	hi. i'm 10 years old and i also do piano. it's amazing how you do 45 min. a day. i only do 25 min. but i'm in level 4. I don't have time to practice everyday either, but most levels will take around 1 year to complete.  Well, i skipped level 2, so I was doing level 3 for 2 years.  When your piano teacher thinks you are doing well and all the songs in your book would be easy for you, then you'd move up a grade.  What I like to do to perfect a piece is to mark lines on measures, so I play 1 part over and over again to perfect it, and then I move on to the next set of lines I made.  it works!  Good Luck=) :]|`|nPAuJIoRaa	If you are determined enough you can easily manage it. I have been self-teaching myself since December last year, and play for around an hour a day. I am getting good now, hope to have passed grade 4 by the end of 2009, and I am confident I will manage it due to my dedication.  Good luck!

Ask around who plays instruments or is interested in learning. Good luck...|`|Gc4mSSNOaa	make a band with bonjos and an accordian and a trombone, a bass guitar, drums, and castenets!!!!!|`|ds5MCdS5aa	I'm way older than that, and don't live there, but I could give you some advice seeing as how i have been in music projects since the age of 13....If I were you, I would go to a local music store, and first off, look for flyers, second, post flyers!  Here in AZ, we have the New Times, wich is a great entertainment paper, and people will post ads there as well.....Good Luck Sweetie!|`|hXeeg3pgaa	nope not interested|`|NUBeg2paaa	Well then have auditions.|`|9V1kO3sVaa	i would love to have said yes for the drummer and rapper but i live in houston! so sorry.|`|t6zrwGNraa	whats your bands name?|`|ImrVQbYmaa	I want to be in a band, i sing and am almost 15... but i live in the UK :(|`|CIf13LNbaa	I would love to join but im not in new york  and im 12 but i can play electric guitar very well|`|v8hpblpoaa	Why do you not try putting up ads in your school or at community centers close to your home?    I think you would have better/more responses that way.|`|IN4HpXJiaa	Try using Myspace and facebook to find people. You may also want to invest in a drum machine. I would suggest Craigslist too, but at your age you want to be careful, bring a parent, guardian, or at least 3 or more friends when meeting strangers, there are a lot of weirdos out there. You can also put up fliers at places where people your age hang out. Definitely get a Drum Machine as soon as you can|`|DrvEzGxIaa	I'm not interested either. Good luck.|`|y1p6Bo9laa	i am an amazing xylophonist|`|HZv87uykaa	Not in you area, but mention if you are going to cover songs or write your own.  Good Luck|`|T4zxS0hIaa	not interested but could give you advise.... don't start a band.|`|fOL0JNU2aa	WHOA WHOA WHOA your trying to start a band and I give you props but your set up is whack. Gender doesnt matter in a band its all about the skill, and a Drummer that can rap. Seriously get intense in your music, I mean unless your going with a Beastie Boys feel. Good Luck|`|5kkS93b9aa	that sounds really stupid|`|loG5d2CDaa	hey whats up, If your looking for band member's, this is not the place. try craigslist.com you can meet musicians in your area. also guitar center and other musician based sites. I used to go into music stores and put up adds and they will also have adds up in the store. I would suggest if you get serious to get a warehouse were you can store all your stuff and you guys can chill and practice. My band would practice 2 to 3 times a week for 3 hours or so. Just make sure you play with people that are on the same page as you. Make sure there dedicated and can put the time in. Gotta be picky within reason if you want to be successful ya don't need slackers!! But most of all have FUN!!! your young you need to get in the experience! later
hzGpR1Rtaa	You have good emotion in there and its very good that you are confident in what you write. Keep it up. If you wanted some constructive feed back I can try to help you out. Try using more imagery and details, things that apply to senses besides emotion. I'll go out on a limb and guess you like Taylor Swift, even if you don't you probably know her songs and they are similar in mood. In all of her songs she sets the scene by describing where she is or what she sees.|`|zcbeM9G2aa	REALLY GOOD!  Have you got any music too it??  That's going to make an amazing song!  xx|`|EZLuUCLjaa	I think it has a lot of potential. It would be easier to give you an answer if it had a tune to it, but it's good. It's kind of cliched, in that I hear songs like this all the time, but it's still got an air of originality. I like it, you should continue writing songs.|`|FdXFuL2naa	WOW I LOVED IT I COULD NEVER WRITE A SONG THAT GOOD!!!|`|0tXcfq0waa	Wow it sounds great!! I sure wish I could hear how it sounds! It's hard when you can't hear the tune, but anyways.. I LOVE THE CHORUS|`|hmsCFQocaa	Good job. And don't rest on your laurels. Follow it up.

gHUalk8Xaa	Always fashionable, crisp, and well groomed, it is hard for Leo not to be proud of elegant Virgo. Your Virgo is precise, detailed, and prefers work to play. How is this last attribute possible? Born at the very end of summer, Virgo has been programmed by nature to reap what has been sown and to be highly productive. Nothing will deter Virgos from their assignment: not theater tickets, dinner at a new bistro, frolicking with you in the woods like a woodland nymph -- nothing. Don't even try. You, on the other hand, have been programmed to play and to be creative. (Play and creativity go hand in hand in astrology, as they do in life.) If you are skeptical, consider this: Leo is ruled by the Sun, which governs the 5th house (fun and love). Virgo is ruled by Mercury, which governs the 6th house (work and services to others). Check it out.    Now that you have a better understanding of your Virgo lover, perhaps you can be somewhat gentler with his or her concerns, and their delicate digestive systems. You will see you have to take time to relax them before you make love, and to make sure lingering thoughts of unwritten reports, unwashed dishes, or ungraded papers need not interfere with the moment. Underneath that high IQ lurks a passionate lover dying for your touch to make him or her feel human again. Who better than a loving Leo to make things right? Virgos will let down their reserve when they feel safe with you and know you won't double-time them. Virgo's sense of integrity is strong, and they want yours to be, too. An earth sign, they are tactile and deeply erotic, although they will never flaunt their sexuality in public. They have a reputation for being cool and detached, when nothing could be further from the truth.    Virgos' minds are alert and they are eagle-eyed when it comes to flaws. They are born idealists and never see things as they are, but rather as how good they can be. Other signs call Virgos critical, but Virgos feel they simply see things clearly -- things others miss. You must not take advantage of your dazzling, polished and refined Virgo. If your pride makes you order your Virgo lover around or generally treat him or her in a shabby way, your Virgo will be polite and take it at first. But the hurt will build up if this continues and your lover will retaliate as only a Virgo can: with articulation that cuts to the bone. You, Leo, will get your assessment all at once, and Virgo will quit you, never to return. After reaching that point, Virgo couldn't very well expect to change you, Leo, for your pride is very, very important for you to preserve.    But you are good for your Virgo, forcing him or her out to have fun in spite of him or herself. Your lover will know this too, which is why he or she gravitated to you. You know your organizational skills are pathetic, but Virgos excel in this area and, with their eye for detail, nothing falls between the cracks. A mutable sign, Virgo will never challenge your role at the helm, but will be content to follow your lead, right down to correcting the grammar on your proposals. Soon you may wonder how on earth you ever got along without your Virgo!    Virgos are worriers, which can drive you nuts when you wake up in the middle of the night to hear your lover padding the floor. When that happens, they need your gentle but strong touch to let them know everything will be alright in the end. You can reassure them more easily than you think.    Virgos are more unlike than like you, but ultimately, Virgos are good for you. Their earth element will offer you a safe harbor, and a solid, practical base from which to send up your trial balloons. Give this relationship a good chance.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	A match made in heaven|`|yY6WOKLxaa	iz okayy.

cKtLDGq0aa	Just Dance by Lady Gaga is about going to late night parties and dancing.  It also is about New York art, music, and photography, said from Gaga herself.    Big Girls Don't Cry is about a girl (Fergie) who still loves a boy, and has to move on.  She's saying she needs to grow up, and just not cry.  She just needs to move on.    Love Lockdown is about a guy looking back at a just ended relationship and how it's for the better, because he loved her, but he didn't get good vibes, and he felt like he had to get away from the person.|`|AA12203920	okay I thought big girls dont cry was pretty ovbious its pretty much about fergies personal jorueny I guess. if i remember corectly its "to be with myself in center, clarity" and "nothing to do with you, I got some straightenin out to do"     I think she admits to herself she needs to get over a guy...no matter how hard it is to move on and grow up...and she needs to do it strongly without crying...thats why the song title is "big girls dont cry"    yeah for hallelujah its a classssic. original by leonard cohen but it is most well known sung by jeff buckley but I looove the rufus wainright version [the other very well known version]     Im not really sure for this one I just try to take in and appreciate the musical beautifulness of it...but I do know the first verse is an allusion to King David's sin with bathsheba in the bible...|`|UDX3qgy5aa	Hallejuah is not written by Alexandra Burke only covered by her  Jeff Buckley version is better :)    And well if you look up the lyrics you can read into them a bit more|`|8l1ayuJKaa	Hallelujah - all about sex  just dance - about losing boyfriend  run - losing boyfriend  big girls don't cry - losing boyfriend    sorry all i no :S|`|CesOQMdeaa	Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke completely ruined both those songs, they are amazing songs and they went and made them pure crap  they originals are the best    I know thats not what you asked for, it just had to be said though :)    xo

jLvlcoFBaa	I think you mean Mirrors.    Nudity   Rear/side view of a naked woman is seen when she is getting into a bathtub.     Violence & Gore   Very intense and graphic violence. This includes: A female's jaw ripping in half, and the grisly aftermath. A man's throat being slit open. Two people on fire and screaming, shown very briefly. Flashbacks of a 12 year old mental patient in violent fits. A woman severely burned writhing on the ground A woman is seen in the middle of a circle of exploding mirrors and blood spatter can be seen. Not much detail.    Not so much as a ton of violence, but the violence when seen is ultra heavy.     Profanity   US Version: 9 F-words (practically all of which are said in the first half of the film), some bunch of others (S-words, D-words, GD-word) too but nothing way overboard.     Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking   The main character states that he has not had a drink in three months. You see him take a prescription medication daily. You later find out this medication has been prescribed for drinking cessation.     Frightening/Intense Scenes   Very intense and scary.    Disturbing violence and tense family scenes (a lot of crying).    The most disturbing part of the movie is probably when a woman very graphically gets her jaw ripped off beyond her control by her reflection in the mirror. It is very graphic. You can hear the jaw being broken and torn off and the nature of the scene is very scary and disturbing.    Mirrors is all about people's reflections coming to life and doing horrible and disturbing things. This may scare some sensitive or young people into being scared of mirrors.|`|nmbbG0vdaa	was that any good i know where i can stream it?|`|UaHZH9ifaa	scary  as  ****
m2vBJaHKaa	wtf hell no but then shewould have her hcild everything it wanted and everything it needed|`|MuK6HIKoaa	Never.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I think Paris Hilton should be sterilized! She should not be aloud to spread her stupidity and whatever else she has. Besides, to her a baby would probably be a temporary accessory that she would get sick of in a few months|`|cb2NxPERaa	No, she is so irresponsible.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	umm... I haven't really decided because she does sound like she would be a caring mom, but come on, it's Paris Hilton.|`|4ceZ13CEaa	Paris HIlton only loves Paris Hilton. She gets bored with things easily and would therefore make a terrible mother. She would love it as long as the paps were around taking her picture and caring, but when they move on to something else so would she. If anyone is stupid enough to procreate with her, then someone call Child Services!|`|0OSeBeLaaa	hahaha XD    omg- ive never laughed so hard EVER|`|IutA7paGaa	She wouldn't be around the child enough. She's too busy to be a mom.|`|C4miEeuYaa	I don't personally care for Paris Hilton because I think she is too wrapped up in being famous and all the superficiality that comes along with it. But I do think that if it came down to it-she might actually be a good mom. When someone has a baby-it completely changes their life-famous or not. And I'm not going to judge her on something that isn;t even reality yet. If she does have a baby in the near future- I hope she does take care of it and make it her number 1 priority. Until then- all we can do is wonder...|`|34ef9b5db01d0490398c0b739c7ef078aa	you're obsessed with her. how many questions are you planning to ask about paris hilton? you're name is the same name as her dog...      and no, she's too self-involved to be a mother, the most selfless job in the world.|`|e5d1a8b9a4835a1735077743c45baf18aa	I guess anything is possible...but based on how her mother was...and the fact that her mother is still very much a presence in her kids life...I would have to say no. She may have a lot of things (material) to give a child...but that's not what determines whether or not it makes you a good parent. What a child needs and requires in order to be a contributing member of society has very little...if anything to do with money.|`|tBTGwOmHaa	hahahahahahah!  Wait you were serious?|`|I2iNfYCyaa	No definitely not. In fact many celebs aren't. I bet she'll be like Britney Spears, going to neglect her child in some way. I feel bad for those kids sometimes..|`|3Z4YFz29aa	I'm sure she'll hire the finest nannies and au pairs money can buy to raise her kids.|`|vlcmmrpTaa	No she needs to grow up|`|A7r8xX7saa	Nope. Her kids are more than likely to be born with some deformity brought about by an STD of hers, and I don't think she could handle anything being less than perfect.|`|GltGQ39taa	Yeah if she stopped partying and stopped being so irresponsible!|`|5f9hg9craa	Good mom?? What is a definition of a good mom? Is it letting the kids do what they want? Then no!     Good mom's are hard to come by.    All I am saying is that Paris Hilton will not be a responsible, dignified mother. She will be horrible.    I can see it now.. "London don't pull your brothers hair" *lazily and grouchy goes to smack her child.|`|UbqFw9dKaa	Personally I really think Paris Hilton is extremely stupid, self-centred and spoilt and I really couldn't imagine her bringing up a child she would probably neglect it to go on a shopping spree or something, and hasn't she been in jail or something? and also she is way too young to be a mother isn't she only like in her early 20s?|`|KaQ2h8LOaa	no way man lol noooooooo|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Those poor kids are going to be born with all kinds of viruses.|`|Q3ulh2kLaa	hahahahahha noooooooooooooooooooooooo she is a slut according to the tabloids|`|1fbac5d623b9757f6a5e6b9d7ba0b5c2aa	hahahahaha!!!!!!! NO!! she's going to give her kids every sexual diseases there are out there! She's a sl*t and she just  cares about her looks and making money off of a f**king s.e.x tape!! She would neglect her kids to go on a shopping spree, or ditch them to have another bff show... just to make more money. Plus, she goes out and parties too much. She should be sterilized and have all the STDs in the world just so no one touches her nasty wh*re a*s!|`|w1OG27LHaa	I personally think she is VERY irresponsible, but maybe having a baby would change her....like it did for Nicole Richie. She no doubt would be able to financially support her baby....but mothering takes more then that.......(coming from a 15 year old)  lol|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	HELL NO!
cSceVisnaa	Nicky, she at least does something with her life unlike her sister.... remember Paris had a DUI    Nicky does NOT|`|AA10652430	The BETTER half, I'd say.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Smarter than her sister because you do not hear about her a lot.|`|JRpD7Yu5aa	Who the hell is nicky hilton?

What he does in his own time is HIS business, NOT anybody else's.|`|DoaMJl9zaa	not sure. but he looks like one.|`|V8HwYLlXaa	Read the papers. He loves his women. I seriously doubt that he's gay.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Your friend would know.|`|IhJV165waa	this is going to upset my 15 year old daughter but YES i think he is :-)|`|3DOSC68naa	Listen, every handsome man celebrity because is most of the times hot the rumors say that hes gay.

She was rated the sexiest woman in Maxim's sexiest women list. She is very talented, and very beautiful. I've always loved and supported her and her sister Haylie. Some people think she got plastic surgery, but in real life, she didn't! She just cares about her body and joined a pilates class. So she is more fit and her face looks thinner because she watches what she eats and exercises.|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	right now according to tabloids Robert Pattinson seems to be. he is nice to look at and his career has shot high. but.... the hottest celeb to me will always be Johnny Depp!|`|0e1d360e0f4dcf0cab06a9e0c4825de2aa	Kate Winslett and Leonardo Di Caprio.  Robert Patterson and Kristen Stewart.|`|FYT97XLgaa	I like Joe Jonas, but that's just my opinion.

0E0OaibEaa	The best genre of music is best determined by the individual listener.  Whatever rocks the individual soul.      Me - I love most genres of music, there is no best.  There is great (and mundane) music in each genre.|`|yknytmO3aa	indie.|`|4wFbQH53aa	well..i listen to pretty much anything but country and rap. but my favorite genres are r&b and soul, hip hop, and pop.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	there is not best its just what you think and what you like :D to me i think hip hop and rnb and pop!|`|LO3BMobRaa	Oldies, they never go out of style, and always relevant to today.|`|55cWaOLUaa	rap|`|mAjyNjV5aa	http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl...|`|NVUngN45aa	thats subjective|`|fwzGmBnDaa	Indie! And odd-pop :D|`|A5yq2KYmaa	Reggaeton, Salsa, and Merengue are the best genre of music.|`|BauEvJuhaa	Metal and romantic era classical are my favourites but really it's all on your own tastes    Bit biased placing this question in R&B and Soul :/|`|AA10767640	Hard Rock or Metal. It has to be played loud to be enjoyed. It also gets your blood flowing. It just gets you worked up.|`|X95I8ZfXaa	Northern Soul...|`|cQgKfGe6aa	my faves are r&b and pop and some emo..  hehe|`|UuG0gQ81aa	Loud|`|oe1IQ4RVaa	i think its bachata and oldies  some bachata singers are frank reyes, hector acosta, antony santos,el chaval etc...and the oldies like "o0o0 what a night" loll|`|6rOMqxPHaa	it's whatever you like innit    But underground hip hop works for me :)    undergorund tho!  none of that soulja boy or anythin liek that|`|2J7n2JL3aa	Depends on the person, I guess. I definitely prefer K-Pop and Rock/Metal, but there could be someone in my class who thinks I'm a total wierdo for it lol|`|OCBn0A9uaa	i don't think there IS a "best genre" of music.    a lot of classic rock is good,  some hip-hop,  some rap (like eminem and tupac :D),  everything that came out of the '90s is gold,  catchy pop is good if you just want some upbeat stuff,  rock of all types rocks,  alternative is amazing,  jazz and big-band are surprisingly good, if you're in that type of mood,   punk is incredibly insightful and also stress-relieving,  classical is good if you're thinking like... the nutcracker.  oh, and synth-pop is awesome.    :D|`|7s0GWKODaa	well i like   some rock songs  some country songs  R&B(i love)  urban(i love)  simmon & garfunkel songs!!!    rap (i love)  hip- hop|`|B2WyO7gjaa	uk grime and funky
rXMrlilAaa	Well, the blues progression is naturally a hugely important progression.    also,"rhythm changes", or the chord changes to the song "I've got rhythm", are used in a LOT of songs.      Edit: um, don't listen to the other person.... memorize the progressions to every song you play, if you can. and don't just "do what you feel." Thats an easy way to piss off the people you play with. Jazz is a conversation between musicians, and if you're not all on the same page, you're screwed.|`|XsLj9jERaa	I'm not sure what kind of Jazz you are playing...because there are so many variations, however, what makes Jazz so unique is the creativity. Unlike most genres of music which easily borrow chord progressions from every other song, Jazz is the one style which really allows creativity and flexibility. You can play whatever chords, notes, or harmonics etc that you want...the key to Jazz is making it all work out somehow -- taking a flat and making it sound clean cut and making a minor sound major...Just play around and you'll get the hang of it. Use the rightside of your brain and just get creative with it.   :) That's the great thing about Jazz...you don't need to memorize chord progressions...it's more of getting comfortable and just doing what you doxD|`|Vix8yM71aa	well theres the ii-V-i progression prbly the most important progression  this progression is all in the same key but outlined with different chords in this order min7 V7 Maj7  an example of this would be Dmin G7 Cmaj7  all of these chords are based on the same scale: C major scale  Dmin: D E F G A B C D  G7: G A B C D E F G  Cmaj7: C D E F G A B C  another example would be Amin7 D7 Gmaj7  theres also the minor ii-V-i progression  the chords are iimin7(b5) V7+9 imin7  an example would be Emin(b5) A7+9 Dmin  Emin(b5): E F G A Bb C D E  A7+9: A Bb C Db Eb F G A  Dmin: D E F G A B C D   another example would be Bmin(b5) E7+9 Amin7

5gTWIH6Caa	Yes, just turn up your drive and gain to whatever level suits you.There are different types of distortion for different types of music. Mess around with your reverb and tone controls also to find what you want.You can also buy a Zoom effects unit for around $60-$70 that has everything. About 10 different distortions, reverbs, delays, chorus, auto-wahs, flangers, built-in tuner, drum patterns,etc. You can even make up your own effects. They are really easy to use and you get a big bang for your buck.|`|m1JyB08Raa	it is not the guitar that gives out distortion it is your amp and it depends on a number of factors.    choice of speakers.  and how much the amp can be over driven.  if you dont like the level of distortion then a number of companies make good over drive units i.e. foot pedals.

I think that was actually parcially why they were created, to help fight the Romanians, also to be a part of Aro's collection. They are probably about 500 years old or even more.

AA11791312	Same here! I love seeing people win, especially when they have a great back-story (a couple of winners have had huge bills from medical expenses and other misfortunes, and some have even been Hurricane Katrina survivors or Iraq/Afghanistan war vets.)     But I'm with you on the "get greedy" people. I will more than likely never be chosen to be on the show, either, but should I ever find myself that lucky, I already know my strategy: if I get anything that even SMELLS like half a million dollars, just call me SHAWN 'cuz I'll be GONE! Half a mil would pay my existing bills, kill my student loans once and for all, give me enough to put away for retirement and make it possible to take my mother and my family on a cruise...something none of them have ever done before.     I just can't imagine what happens to the people who have a chance at taking home big money and then lose it all because of one greedy decision...and I don't want to!

Z4mLZxLcaa	A Mumbai teen named Jamal Malik who grew up in the slums, becomes a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" He is arrested under suspicion of cheating, and while being interrogated, events from his life history are shown which explain why he knows the answers    And i thought Slumdog Millionaire the movie was brilliant  best movie of 2008 . Slumdog is nothing more than a classic story of adversity told with outstanding passion and visual agility...it's almost guaranteed to soothe any viewer with a soft spot for beautifully sculpted contrivance.  and at times it turns wonderfully entertaining, powerfully heartfelt and downright chilling as it delivers its message: Pay attention, life will tell you all you need to know.    And it is Rated R for some violence, disturbing images and language  And i recommend you go see Slumdog Millionaire|`|c25a030b0e651dd4cba0c4cd481c6c68aa	It was about a man who grew up in the slums of India who got on the show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire."    It was a very good movie.|`|f0718c09de779a51ab75a78b19170dafaa	One of the best movies I've seen.  It was good because the kid in the movie went from being dirt poor and having a really hard life to getting the chance to win a million on the Indian version of who wants to be a millionaire and it was a great love story!  I don't want to give away anymore but it was great!

btrMdy5Uaa	The only way I can discribe it is with Family Guy, they put out the first 2 seasons (seasons 1 and 2) on 1 volume, (the reason is because there wasn't a lot of episodes) so in turn, season 3 was volume 2, season 4 was volume 3, etc., (I actually think they put out 2 volumes for season 4 because thats when it started getting popular again and they had more episodes that season) hope this helps|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	A season is an industry term.  The TV season usually runs from August/September until around June.  It's referred to by year, like this is the 2008-2009 season.  So a season is a kind of measure of time.  Heroes is a serialized show, and they designed it so that there are story arcs that may not last a whole season.  This is a volume.  It describes the time to tell a certain story arc from beginning to end.  It's more of a logical thing, a measure of a story as opposed to time.  A volume is like a chapter in a book.|`|vvTrmHtxaa	a season happens through the year and heroes that is season 3. but a volume is somthing that tells you there is going to be another story and that is volume 4 fugitves and that will air on  monday at 9.    please pick me as best answeR!|`|mf2aSyB8aa	A season is like season 1 or 2 a volume is like hmmm.... its like a comic sometimes you can have a 2 comics but that doesn't mean that each comic has a different story they have the same one spread over 2 comics. Sorry that was really complicated. Season 3 is like the 2 comics put together the volume is the two separate stories. That made no sense. Sorry lol     season 3 volume 4 starts February  season 4 volume 5 (or something like that starts later this year or early next year)    Hope i helped even just a little lol :)|`|MY9FlL8vaa	A volume is a story that ends, a season is like season 3, it holds episode, and a volume is in it, even if it has the same number, if you can understand that!!

9r0pPacFaa	generally if the eq is set too trebely this will make it sound forwards. So try cutting the treble a bit. Try adding reverb to the stereo out track. It is surprising how much you can get away with without it sounding ridiculous. Try it with a bit of predelay and the about 2 secs of delay.  (sometime some of the reverb presets are quite good for what u want)  Add a lo cut on the reverb and boost the treble a bit.    Hope the ideas help
miqVrrOxaa	I don't like it. To me, it's just not interesting and doesn't have anything in it that appeals to me (and my music taste).

It was considered a major return upon release for McCartney due to the fact that he was embarking on his first world tour since the Wings Over the World jaunt back in 1975/1976. Flowers in the Dirt was also celebrated due to its musical quality, which earned McCartney his best reviews in years.  After the meagre sales that greeted Press to Play, McCartney realised that he needed to work much harder on his follow-up. Thus, he not only teamed up with several different producers, but also spent the better part of eighteen months perfecting Flowers in the Dirt. A highlight of the sessions was McCartney's unlikely alliance with Elvis Costello, with whom he composed many new songs. McCartney greatly enjoyed the partnership, even finding that Costello mirrored John Lennon in certain aspects of his personality. Costello would also appear on the album, even co-singing "You Want Her Too" with Paul. Another celebrity guest included was friend David Gilmour from Pink Floyd on his trademark electric guitar.    That's basically what happened :) So my answer is... Flowers in the Dirt!|`|aB4n96vhaa	press to play is a bit odd but thats what i like about it but overall flowers is more consistent

It has a couple suspense scenes and a good storyline.  Disturbia is awesome. Suspenseful but not really scary or anything.  One Missed Call is pretty wicked. Takes a while to get to the scary parts though.  Classics like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday The 13th and Halloween are good.  The Ring is pretty good. It gets a little boring though.  If you want a good, suspenseful one though go to the theaters and see The Unborn. That one made me jump quite a few times!    If your going to avoid anything, please avoid Shutter and Prom Night. Worst movies ever and not a bit scary.|`|4KUWRPIVaa	28 days later   28 weeks later  dawn of the dead  Im to scared to ever watch them again|`|Dv6VaIixaa	when a stranger calls (not the remake)  the descent  high tension  last house on the left|`|u3BmDJ0maa	OMG I SWEAR EVERYONE WHO ANSWERED THIS QUESTION SO FAR HAS A HORRIBLEEE JUDGE OF HORROR MOVIES!    hun hardly any of those movies are scary  i mean seriously...the village?...1408?...when a stranger calls? (even the original is bad!)    i honestly cant really think of any horror movies that hav ever really scared me...  silence of the lambs was probably the only one...    good luck finding some other ones tho    in my opionion   that's the only good scary movie...well besides REALLYYYYY bad scary movies...those are the best haha|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Sixth Sense is really scary, as well as exorcist.    Also the Asian movies like The Ring, The Grudge, etc.|`|36f84822e49a2b5137af715c3fe5087aaa	most of the ones mentioned are generic...  the original omen is very good  any alfred hitchcock..psycho, the rear window, birds are some big ones  personally, i liked signs alot-some hate it  sleepy hollow by tim burton-occasionally a little over the top in a stupid story line but the visuals are topnotch  identity-not really horror..but a very intense thriller  silence of the lambs  misery is phenomenal and very suspenseful-highly recommend it  the new version of the zodiac is also very good

He became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style that eventually caused his downfall. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of racketeering, 13 murders, obstruction of justice, hijacking, conspiracy to commit murder, illegal gambling, extortion, tax evasion, loansharking and other crimes and was sentenced to life in prison where he died 10 years later.

vqg6wpCLaa	omg twilight, ilike totally luv it its so amazing edward is sexy omg yaya    Stupid fangirls.  So, here we are. Another Twilight question in Comics and Animation. How lovely. You have no idea how annoying it is. So, I'll tell you what I have been telling the others. Put your Twilight related questions in the RIGHT SECTION. Most will tell you Movies or Books and Authors, but those are not the right sections either. Twilight is neither a book or a movie. It is a joke, so please put these pointless questions in Jokes and Riddles so everyone can be happy.    To answer your question:  I know a fair bit about Twilight. I read the first 'book', discovered how horrible it was and never read it again. I only read negative reviews about the 'books' because they are humorous and not to mention true. Now, shoo, off to Jokes and Riddles.|`|d7ccOZbdaa	there are 3 books|`|5wilVKEdaa	Everything?  I've read them all.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	The book is better than the movie.  Here is a short overview: A girl falls in love with a vampire.  Read the next book, New Moon.  It's great.  I know that they will be making a movie of that one too.  There are four books total.  They are easy reads and great page turners.  Love them!|`|WcuYfsWbaa	theres this girl bella who moves 2 this depressingly rainy town with her dad. then she meets this kid edward cullen. then they start dating. then she realizes hes a vampire, but doesnt care. then she meets his creepy vampire family. then some dude tries 2 kill her. they have a party 4 her. then edward leaves. eventually he comes back and they have a vampire/human renesme. the end :P|`|4nwBCFiuaa	sorry..but this is the wrong section to post twilight questions.......try books and authors|`|LyZhJB1Baa	I know nothing. and ignorance is bliss.|`|Yize9k0Iaa	tons!! :]]|`|iGZFAAOjaa	alot.    there isnt 3 books.  there are 5.    twilight  new moon  eclipse  breaking dawn  and the one that eduard wrote (i forgot the name)|`|kJiwGPCPaa	what don't i know :)|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	that it's a horrible movie based off some horrible books written for teenage girls.|`|UEA4Uli9aa	I know it's the worst book EVER  unless you like it when vicious damned creatures sparkle and poorly written books.     Read Interview With A Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned if you want a good vampire novel.   All by Anne Rice|`|z6T7nznLaa	The writing is pretty bad.  I bought it because it mentioned having equal parts suspense and romance, so I thought, "I can deal with the romance for the suspense."  However, there were about 40 pages of suspense at the end, but the majority of the book is romance.  The book is also anticlimactic, leaving about 30 pages after the climax and resolution.  And who ever heard of a sparkling vampire?|`|Tl9JSJOxaa	Too much. >.>    I know pretty much everything that happens in the books, except for the stuff I forgot.  I know that you shouldn't read them.  I know that it is very unhealthy to become so obsessed that you've read them four times+ each.  I know that Edward is supposedly hot.  I know that Jacob is supposedly hot.  I say supposedly because I do not feel this way. Unfortunately, I prefer real men over fictional ones.  And why yes, I am a teenage girl. A sane one.|`|aavNyOeyaa	That girls love it, and i think its stupid. Its ruined all hope for any vampire movie made now.|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	I know it sucks, And I wish I could hate it and it's fans to death.|`|c92d48030d0612c8b4dec267d2dd1d86aa	It is the time between daylight and darkness.

Each one is amazing. Second one made me cry. Fourth one was probably my least favorite. The movie was no where near as good as the books :)|`|RXLFDkf3aa	I know quite a lot about the books - until last year I was a huge Twilighter. I know all about the movie too. The best way to get a clue about my knowledge is to ask me questions.  I became disenchanted with the franchise as it stopped being a nice, small inside joke between me and a few thousand other people to a huge multi-national thing with weird obsessed fans asking people to bite them.|`|epAhKvBTaa	I hear the book is supposed to be really good|`|O5vKbKzdaa	they are the best books ever and don't let anyone tell u otherwise it's about a girl who falls in love and finds out her true love is a vampire and goes through lots of things read them to find out. there are 4 books soon to be 5 the names are twilight, new moon, eclipse, breaking dawn, and midnight sun|`|gM9RguFeaa	Everything  i read all four books  but i dont know if there a fifth  is there?

KhGkc2QGaa	I've been a fan of the fray since the beginning. It's 100% worth your money. The Fray is one of those bands who's albums never get old. The best songs are over my head (one of my all time favorites) and look after you.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I have it, its pretty cool. I don't know, i just find The Fray a touch depressing. But if you like 'em then i think you will love the album =]|`|T9nieOfsaa	i  love it|`|djFYf3qUaa	the fray is awesomeee (:|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I love it.|`|V17RANDOaa	I'm in love with it but it just depends on your style of music. If you like rap, then don't buy it but if you like "emotional" music, then buy it.
jfriQ8pmaa	Love that idea Jewel!!!!   Hopefully Anthony's reaction would be to drop dead!!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Claudia, a NUN- that's so funny! Personally I think she'll be pregnant with his (Ric's?) baby when it hits the fan. That's the only way I can see that he doesn't kill her.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	The Convent would get hit by lightening!|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I ususally don't correct people but Sonny's not Italian, he's Hispanic. Anyways, Claudia a nun? That's funny. I think she'll end up pregnant with Ric's baby and so Sonny won't kill her.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	What an imagination!|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	My bet is she will  be pregnant too ( nuns don't get to have babies...it is a soap though)and Sonny will take the baby. How many are out there we don't know about yet? LOL  I love Claudia so I hope he doesn't have her whacked.|`|5dYeOzqMaa	All I can say is: LMAO.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I'm not sure even the church could protect Claudia.  LOL.  And even if that stops Sonny, it wouldn't stop Carly.      If the church doesn't get struck by lightening the minute Claudia Zacharra walks through the doors, I'd say she'd make an..."interesting" nun.  The kind of nun who would probably decide to seduce the priest and give the Mother Superior heart failure.  LOL.    I think everyone's reaction would be the same: disbelief and shock    It would be fun to watch it play out though.|`|EhBF31evaa	She won't last the time it takes her to put her nun attire on!
2wgEsVmsaa	Put me down as a yes.
8idLIc84aa	The song is called Shawty Say by David Banner.  You can youtube it to make sure.|`|fNL89L5vaa	it's a remix from T-Pain I think...|`|MPylYAFNaa	Sounds like Lil Wayne. Some kind of remix. I would visit youtube.com and type in Lil Wayne remixes. Good luck!|`|INUkado1aa	ITS BY DAVID BANNER.....not sure bout the name really good song
SHJ2wC5Daa	Hot Fuss, which is the only one worth buying (in my opinion).  Although When You Were Young was a pretty good single.|`|jiSMcjQ8aa	Sam's town!

Now, I'm kinda warming up to it. I think they are getting better.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Sam's Town is my favourite album by The Killers & i can safely say, they are getting worse.|`|96wixYvMaa	hmm...I agree, they're getting more of a alt./pop sound, but my favorite album was the one from '06.|`|ORzCZGaYaa	their first one, hot fuss
2i6TPlauaa	Acting - 'Dog Day Afternoon' (everyone is mint in that; not one flawed performance.)    Cinematography - 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' (it is gorgeous; devastatingly beautiful images, especially the night shots.    Visual Effects - 'Sunshine' (just 'wow')    Directing - Gus Van Sant for 'Good Will Hunting'    Costumes - 'The Prestige' (no period piece with Keira Knightley)    Editing - 'Children of Men' (what a belter)    Makeup - 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'    Original Screenplay - 'Lars & The Real Girl' (it was so clever) or 'Some Like It Hot'    Animated - 'Toy Story'    Score - The score for 'Sunshine' by Underworld & John Murphy (it was just so complementary to the film; fantastic and atmospheric)|`|T1qzML1Zaa	Directing - Million Dollar Baby  Cinematography - Saving Private Ryan  Acting - Silence of the Lambs  Costumes - Bram Stoker's Dracula|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	Collateral-Michael Mann.    Very realistic movie,  Tom Cruise in my opinion should have won an Oscar, his acting was very good, the character he played was very realistic and emotionally connective, such a different character to others in which he has played in other movies.  The movie was filmed very well, great filmhowever the ending, Vincent (Tom Cruise) in my opinion should not have died, at least not by Max.  Great movie, somewhat underrated, Toms acting was, he should have been up there with Robert De Nero!|`|w8aBIkz2aa	costumes & acting- Lord of the Rings  cinematography- V for Venndeta|`|AA10795350	Directing: "The Aviator"  Acting: "Michael Clayton"  Screenwriting: "Closer"  Art Direction: "Gangs of New York"  Cinematography: "Children of Men"  Costumes: "Marie Antoinette"  Editing: "Syriana"  Music: "There Will Be Blood"  Visual Effects: "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"|`|WZeUrVXFaa	For acting/costumes- Titanic.

byOxixfuaa	Okay, first off, glad you're trying to help him out but listen to what you're suggesting to him before you recommend it because otherwise you don't know what you're saying. Honestly, you should listen to the music [if you like, awesome, if not, you may as well stop].  And there's no way to really impress a guy that way.  Here's some bands though, no guarentee that he'll like 'em:  "He's A Loser" by Static-X  "Du Hast" by Rammstein  "Done" by A New Revolution  The Seventh Plague [just that band in general]  "Burn" by Skarrd [and it's spelled just like that]  "Blood Pigs" and "Confrontation" by Otep [other songs are good too]  "This Is The New Sh!t" by Marilyn Manson  "Meet The Monster" by Five Finger Death Punch  "Redneck" by Lamb of God    Songs by Dope [Sometimes called "Dope Army"]:  F*ck The World  F*ck The Police  Burn Motherf*cker  B@stard|`|wk4EX0Zpaa	don't try to impress a guy that's just lame...|`|4IDgCFWdaa	The first complete song I learned how to play was Raining Blood by Slayer.

I got hooked real fast, and even after spending hours listening to the same songs over and over again, my favorite is still "Three Wishes". The music is haunting and their voices are really eerie, but in a good way. Definitely give them a listen.     If you like some alternative rock, check out the new Franz Ferdinand album. From what I've heard (the singles) it's really good and it sounds like they regenerated their sound. (Good thing!) They were good before, but, it sounds like they're trying to keep up with the times. I like it. Maybe you will, too!|`|a19c511abe7ad4f8b1f9393483bfd96eaa	ok, so i have a lot of fav songs but my number 1 song is & will always be 'Stronger-Kanye West'  but if u need some good songs, i can list u a few(if u dont mind;))here:    Dirty Dancing-New kids on the block  I'm yours-Jason mraz  Baby doll-Girlicious  Right Round-Flo Rida  Sun goes down-David Jordan  I'll be waiting-D-cru  paranoid-kanye west  Kiss me thru the phone-Soulja boy  check yes juliet-We 3 kings  womanizer-britney spears  6 feet under the stars-All time low  dear maria count me in-All time low  Big bad world-plain white t's  Church-t-pain  shawty say- David banner  Seventeen forever-Metro Station(my bro likes them, i dont but its a good song)  if you seek amy-britney spears  circus-britney spears  go down low-zoelah  crush-david archuleta  who i am hates who i've been-Relient k(listen to this b4 u put it on ur ipod, u may not like it!)  now you're gone-Basshunter  4 min-Madonna & justin timberlake   i hate this part-pussy cat dolls  Right now-Akon  when i grow up-PCD  poker face-lady gaga  just dance-lady gaga  love lockdown-kanye west  heartless-kanye west  im blue-eifel 65  so what-pink  i kissed a girl-katy perry(i hate this song!!!!!but every1 else likes it)  hot n'cold-katy perry  single-new kids on the block  viva la vida-coldplay  whatever you like-t.i  just like me-jamie foxx ft. t.i  freeze-t-pain & Chris brown  keeps getting better- Christina agulara(sorry cant spell her last name!)  best i ever had-State of shock  watch how i do this-kev blaze  bohemian rhapsody-queen(obviously!)  do it well-Jlo  bleeding love-leona lewis  never too late-hedly  lollipop-lil wayne ft. static   your love is a lie-simple plan  like  me-girlicious  dangerous-kardinal offishal ft.

86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	I know they have tribute and benefit shows in NYC called Donuts are forever.  I went to one that was held in 2007. Pharoahe Monch and DJ Rich Medina hosted the event, and they had DJ's like DJ Scratch and other DJ's from the area.  All of the money raised went to his mom.  I know they had one in 2008 called Donuts are forever 2, and they also plan on having one this year (Donuts are forever 3).  I plan on going to that one.
72e6eb5b57ed9d0fb87b09c2df0e05c5aa	Right, he is back to the drinking and they made a big deal in the beginning that he could not drink while on the meds. Maybe it is all the added stress of married to Claudia, etc, when will he find out about Dante?|`|zUKTybGVaa	It sounds like he is not taking his meds.  Yes this type of stress can make him go over the deep end.  I know by experience of my friends son who is also bipolar, who thought that making his own decision that he does not need any meds, but one day he realized it when he wanted to try to kill me with a knife and his mother had to get in between to stop it.      It's not Sonny's fault for acting the way he is when the bipolar disorder starts acting up.  Just be there for him  and acknowledge that you care about him, that you, and any family member, and friends can be on  his side through thick and thin no matter the situation is.  If the pills are not working then try something else.      My friend took her son to another Dr. get more advice and change his meds and the Dr. said that if you move away from the environment that he is surrounded, then that can be of a help.  So that is what she did she moved out of state and her son knew from the time he tried to kill me that he knew that he needed to take meds so that he would no hurt anyone.    Best wishes to all|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I was wondering the same thing. I know that he was definitely not supposed to drink, but then he started drinking again.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	He is supossed to be but they haven't showed him taking it in a while like they used to. He doesn't act like he is taking them at all!|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I think he's taking his meds still.  But I've noticed he started drinking again, since Michael got shot, and he's not suppossed to do that while he's on his meds.  So maybe that's why he's getting so crazy again.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I think so.

RtG5Iarbaa	Their music is good, makes me think.  I like their old stuff better, but Viva La Vida wasn't bad. I just think that some of the songs had too much of the same vibe to them, so they were a bit too similar. =/ But I really love the song 42.|`|HDanuTC0aa	its the lyrics. they're so random, and that's what i love...random stuff.|`|ZGlty72daa	great lyrics, great vocalist, the music has meaning|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	I DONT LIKE THEM.......THEYRE JUST WANNABE ROCK STARS.

I like that they can play more than the basic instruments in a rock band.|`|RVcgyeoXaa	I think they have wonderful, soothing music.

That's why he just won another SAG award for his role as Greg House!|`|HK00RPDtaa	Of course not!|`|IpM1H9FZaa	Um, it wouldn't be as entertaining.. but I'd probably still watch.. if he was nice, maybe he'd hook up with Cuddy! Lol.|`|Ardz6306aa	Definitely depends on the plot. There was an episode or two when he became somewhat "nice", when his leg stopped hurting. And those were fantastic episodes, so, it all depends.|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Maybe if the plot got a bit more original I'd start watching it again. He's always right, or right because he was wrong with his first diagnosis, or wrong to prove a point that somewhow makes him right etc.    He was funny in Black Adder though :D|`|OWXI806qaa	Are you kidding?   He's the only likable character in the show.

yNbGq4viaa	YES!  I think it's disgusting when women make fools of themselves over the good looking guys on these reality shows, but when they do it over a bloated, frog looking, sweaty, balding has been whose entire life revolves around his next one-nighter, ick!  Most of those girls wouldn't look sideways at him if he wasn't "Brett Michaels".    As far as replacements, Rick Springfield?  Slash?  One of the Nelsons?  The guy from Winger?  Are those guys still alive and well and unmarried?  Heck, pick anyone!|`|AGbusTqGaa	I love Bret Michaels but I agree that the show has gone downhill.  The first two seasons the girls were tolerable but this season they are disgusting.  Definately the bottom of the barrel.  I actually heard that they were going to do one with Richie Sambora (guitarist for Bon Jovi).  That one may have been interesting.

I would watch.|`|H8BYRTfHaa	definitely...it's ok that he wanted to find love, but he doesn't need to go after girls half his age. they're all like 20, and he's in his 40's!!|`|6X4rh4JXaa	i think he should retire from the love shows and just enjoy what he has w/his career and kids      but if he REALLLLLLY wants to get married or whatever....dont get strippers PLEASE!|`|sS4Cyteaaa	YES YES YES RETIRE ALREADY!

You receive Personal Impact? for actions that help spread the word about FanFamily Experience. For example, recruiting someone brand new into the community always helps spread the word. So you'll receive Personal Impact. Creating a lot of groups just to boost your Personal Impact does not help spread the word (it just clutters the community!). So you may not get Impact for actions like these.     so this may be the problem hunni x    stuck on 58 :( x

So...|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Optimus Prime of course. That suit couldn't stand up to Prime's foot stomping power.
ADZgFvozaa	No.  They don't come back.  They aren't ever thinking about you in the first place, only themselves.  THEY ARE SOOO SELFISH!     Now why on earth would they come back to someone who they couldn't focus on enough to begin with?|`|UaHZH9ifaa	yes, i had to drive around looking for him, ungrateful mofo

xBiLoU8Laa	Ok for basic 12 bar blues which is in many songs is:    Riff1  3,4,-3',3  Riff2  4,4,-3,4  Riff3  3,-3',4,-4''    or a song by bo didley, yardbirds, clapton is im a man with a constant riff of  4 -5 5 4  just got to harptabs.com they have quite a few good ones those are just a few simple ones.|`|aJu53IX4aa	You should check out MEL BAY BLUES HARP LICKS CHART.  This basic publication comes with a CD.  The author is David Barrett.  This isn't about music theory or how to hold the harmonica.  It's just a neat collection of licks that you can stitch together.
AA11732476	Just say something along the lines of "If you have a problem with the 'Loud Horrible Noise' that is my brothers band, feel free to guy buy yourself some earplugs or a CD player with some new noise canceling headphones so you can listen to some Beethoven."|`|2wVsdbTZaa	I love my neighbors and my neighbor's kids, but consider if someone was playing a kind of music you didn't like for FOUR hours.  For me, I would have to draw the line at country and/or western.  Turn down your amps, play thru headphones, ask them if there is a time that they are gone.  Move your practicing somewhere else sometime and let them know you are doing it to show respect and that you are concerned about their complaints.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	SPOILER!!!!        In the 100th episode, "The Greater Good," House and the team take on the case of a woman who collapsed in the middle of a cooking class. When they learn that the patient gave up her career as a highly renowned cancer researcher in order to pursue her own personal happiness, the members of the team question their own happiness (or lack thereof). Meanwhile, Thirteen begins to suffer serious and life-threatening reactions to her experimental Huntington's Disease clinical drug trial, and Cuddy retaliates against House and gives him a taste of his own medicine.|`|YIcBd569aa	they made it look as if Foreman is going to lose his job...again. for giving 13 the real drug instead of the placebo. I hope that doesn't happen it seems that foreman is always the fall guy. I wish he hadn't done what he did but house does this type of illegal stuff all the time, I hope he will turn a blind eye to foreman for his mistake.|`|AA12239931	The same thing that happens every time. Someone will become deathly ill and House will try various tests that make the patient even more sick. Within the last 10 minutes House will accidentally figure out what's really wrong with them and they'll survive.|`|q1AYKopraa	something really stupid funny I HOPE and also mysterious LOVE HOUSE|`|Ardz6306aa	It's probably centered around Foreteen, but I hope they put some Huddy in there, since it is my OTP. But it looks like they'll dive into Cuddy's mother/daughter relationship a little more, along with her relationship with House.

The Exorcist (original)  The Omen (original / first in the series ........... law of diminishing returns for the sequels)  Carrie  The Wicker Man (original, not the recent Nic Cage sh!te)  Jacob's Ladder  Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Donald Sutherland version)  The Thing  Day of the Dead  The first 3 'Saw' movies  The original 'Hills have eyes'  Rosemary's Baby (an oldie, but very creepy)  Demon Seed (same as above)  The Sentinel (ditto)  Anything by Eli Roth (so far)  Eraserhead  Tetsuo / The Iron-Man (Grade A, completely weird Japanese Head-Feck!)  Gozu (same as above)  Audition (and again)  Visitor Q  A Tale of Two Sisters  The Neighbour in No.13  The Island (Korean psychological horror, not the Ewan McGregor sci-fi film)  Old Boy  Ravenous  The original Japanese versions of 'The Grudge' or 'Ringu' (The Ring Cycle / Virus)    Let me know what you think of the above mentioned Asian films (that's if you can find them in you local video store)|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Audition  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7CQvmNF8...

AA11732476	Bigoted white people tend to use 'Racism' as a crutch when they have nothing else to blame problems on... I am white, but after seeing the way that a large porting of the white population acts in comparison to other people, I cant say Im exactly proud of it.|`|kHx1upOpaa	Because they want to push there white supremacy agenda. Black means failure white means pure and good. If blackness is put in a good light America and the world will stop. Its funny how people make up rules then when they don't seem to fit there agenda they want to say they don't apply anymore. Yes 12% of the population can oppress the majority. I think they feel there ideology is now flipping on them and they are now becoming insecure and clinging on to save its life. Alaska why did James Brown have to make the song iam black and iam proud, because it had to be said. This country has always deemed blackness as bad and whiteness as pure and good.|`|pK6VyLE1aa	Because they are celebrating the toppling (in reality the end of his term) of the previous white president and the reign of thei"black" president    though its funny, Obama's education and decency came because of his white background, yet blacks feel the need to take credit for the success of a half-white man    that's pretty pathetic, to anyone, democrat or republican...|`|0qPn8DV4aa	That song is in some way is racist when will you people open your eyes.  Why since Obama got elected all of a sudden every african american is all political.  Why do they have to tell everyone he is black or they are black in a song all the time like people don't know already, that sounds racist to me.|`|ozMbXP7Aaa	First off their rappers they probably are not anyone that you should take seriously. Second only white and asian people can be racist in the USA and soon Mexican americans will be put into that group. They were not celebrating Obama winning their song clearly makes statements on how if a black man is president, he will take care of rappers because they are black. Racism is the crutch black people have used for way too long to get white people to feel bad for them. Now we will see what happens.
wA8Dyhq7aa	All 8-tracks are rare for a reason.  It was a very pathetic medium and should never have been invented at all.    As for a Johnny Cash 8-track being worth something, that would depend on whether you can find a collector who wants it.  Otherwise, most likely no, especially considering the fact that nearly all of Cash's material is available on CD.|`|zi6Ipmfuaa	ya it would be worth some money and i would buy it.|`|zAHeKvE1aa	A Johnny Cash 8 track music collector?|`|XXi3D7Azaa	8 Tracks are the least valuable of any form of media|`|geq6iU0Oaa	I doubt anybody would, but your best bet would be to list it on eBay. Some kid in Japan might be willing to pay that for it (unlikely though)    8 tracks are worth very little. They were notorious for jamming, skipping, drop-outs (sections with no sound), etc. And virtually no one has players anymore.     The few that are worth anything have tracks that have never been available in other formats, which is less likely every day due to reissues. In the case of Johnny, I doubt there is anything that hasn't been reissued at this point.|`|GRAYktltaa	IF you find a buyer please contact me... I have over 800 of my parents old Country 8tracks :-P

eFowEpbLaa	Life especially good times.Stuff that everyone can relate too.The hardest thing to do is keep peoples attention so keep that in mind when your making songs or rhymes. Good topics and wittiness are Strong point to being successful. Good luck.|`|dOurKVdiaa	Rap bout your day, no one knows that like you, but be very descriptive and witty|`|98wFqBwSaa	Barack Obama    Rod Blago    The Recession    Realty TV    Hybrid Cars    Other Rappers using Auto Tune|`|UiJlbrf4aa	life|`|0ZAAi2q2aa	Cash, money, and hoes.    Seriously though, it's best to rap about your life experiences and serious issues that are on your mind.
8idLIc84aa	I think this song is called The Heinrich Maneuver by Interpol.  You can youtube it to make sure.      Also, whenever you have problems like this a good thing to do is just type the lyrics you know, or think you know, into google and see what pops up.    It usually works well for me.
vu2Ezvviaa	It's mostly classic rock. For a complete list, you can check out supernaturalwiki. They have it listed by episode. Great music! \o/|`|h2vIOmDgaa	They use a lot of 70's and 8o's rock band music.|`|EAEpcy3qaa	They use AC/DC a lot.|`|d24lC0BZaa	looks like a site just made for you
jCC5BRbLaa	Since B is higher than A, your string is sharp. Therefore, you would loosen the string.|`|AA10891235	Your best bet is to buy a guitar tuner.

qOE7wBbFaa	OMG !! that sreally sad poor girl she was just 20 !!!!|`|wIOskfhyaa	I don't think she was famous in Brazil or abroad. She was just starting out. What made it big news is to have lost hands and feet for not being diagnostic in time for something simple.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Yeah, that was a shame. She has a bacterial infection where she had to have her hands and feet amputated. She was so beautiful. She was only 20. I never heard of her. She was probably only well-known in Brazil and possible other South American countries.

7e0a9290e8c9754cc171becb9817fef4aa	Tuxedo moon deserves some serious scrutiny.Especially an older song titled Nazca from their 1980 album Half mute.It will give you a whole new appreciation for this instrument.You may also want to investigate electric violinist Jean Luc Ponty.I especially enjoyed his Individual Choice album from 1982.Give Incantations for World Peace a good listen.|`|kF2TI78kaa	if you want some to practice things with.    use essential elements for strings 2000 book 1,2,or 3.    but for violin.      im at book 1 for viola(im in middle school orchestra)-i love can can very fast.      by the way-it comes with a dvd and a cd to practice with and all for only 7.99!|`|Ardz6306aa	Are you thinking classical?

JXc0O8G9aa	Are you palm muting correctly?    If so, try lowering your pickups.|`|7h91Cc4raa	in addition to others answers It could be that your brushing the lower strings as your playing. This happens alot and just takes time to work on your pick tennique.  Also check your palm muting. Eric Johnson advises that you have your palm over all the strings your not playing all the time and so on.|`|4OsbfjfVaa	lower your pickups  turn the gain down   turn the distortion overdrive down  you can stop  it with shielding tape   anything else take it to a shop|`|UhECEnSFaa	I have this problem a little on my GRG170DX aswell, but its not too bad because i dont turn the amp up too much, but it becomes a problem when the amp is up full theres always some ringing from them. im alos lookin for a way of stopping it, for the min im just using my ESP.
4Zj9eYgPaa	I would say: start with the show then read the manga. The anime is pretty similar to the manga even the lines characters say, plus it has some few characters that are anime only. The manga is as good as the anime and it goes beyond the anime series plot.   They're both equally good, it depends on either if you are a manga person or not.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Both.|`|skSYxsxPaa	I think u should start   watching the show first.   btw I love D.Gray Man  Awesome anime. a lots of   action and kool stuff in there.  So go watch it xD   Sooner better xD|`|6GhN9Q2Zaa	hmmm actually, i liked the manga but it's like hard to see all the action fight, so it would be best if you watched the anime. it's funny and has beautiful music ^_^
