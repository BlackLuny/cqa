20090309131604AAT87nC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	When a girl says she's attracted to a guy who's ambitious, does she ever mean it literally?	It doesn't take a lot of ambition to have your daddy put you through school and then inherit the family business, but that doesn't seem to stop a lot attractive girls from wanting to f**k this guys.  I see pudgy fratboys getting the most ridiculously attractive girls here (UC, but I'm not saying which one), and I go to the gym, I used to model (nothing serious), I'm almost 6'4" with broad shoulders. I'm a Grad student who graduated *** laude (after putting myself through school--no parents, no loans), and I work really hard both professionally and scholastically, and it seems that they would rather spread their legs for some drunken idiot with a new BMW he didn't have to work for.

Im just gonna use the 1st letter of their names (since I don't want to give names away. ) I've known my friend, N, for about 2 years now. Ive known her since the ending of 5th grade. But we didn't go to the same school in 6th grade, ( but i kept in touch with her) but now we do in 7th.  Ive known my other friend, A , since the beginning of 6th grade. And, on the first day of 7th grade, both of my friends met each other. And everything has been going good until last week. They started acting like they're best friends! Im glad that they're friends, I mean I'd rather have 2 friends that are friends each other than 2 friends that are enemies. But I wish they would let me in on their little friendship. They started waiting for each other, talking and laughing with each other and doing everything together, like BFF's. Without me. I know that jealously is one of the 7 deadly sins, so I want to overcome being so jealous. What should I do?

20090309133957AAZ5lSe	Social Science;Psychology	Psychology.... PLEASE....Help?	1.) Dante was talking to his classmate when he suddenly called her “sweetheart.” Identify how Sigmund Freud would likely explain this situation.        Dante had trouble choosing the right word when stating something.        Dante is conditioned to say sweetheart because his classmate always rewards him with a smile.        Dante suffered from a hallucination that made him utter the word.        Dante experienced a verbal slip that gave insight into his hidden desires.       2.) Which best explains why a convex lens is used for hyperopia?        A convex lens causes light to focus upon images in the environment.        A convex lens directly affects the ciliary muscle by strengthening it.        A convex lens creates a refraction of the light to focus the image on the cornea.        A convex lens provides balance against the elongated eyeball or bulging cornea.      3.) Which best explains why some parts of the body are more sensitive than others?        Sensitive areas of the body have thinner skin.        Sensitive areas of the body have more nerve endings.        Sensitive areas of the body have the dermis closer to the epidermis.        Sensitive areas of the body have a greater concentration of hair follicles.

The other night i had a dream that it was halloween and i dressed up as some sort of vampira, along with my other friends, and insted of trick-or-treating, halloween took place at this mall (oddly, this mall has popped up in most of my dreams) and it was SOOO crowded and fun! we walked around and my mom was there??? but it was all good.      the part i remember the most was when we went into this store that had been transformed into a haunted ride. The theme of the ride was about this man who was once nice but his wife died so he turned evil. I was covering my friend's little sister's eyes(she wasnt dressed up). After the ride was over, the ride supervisor asked me to take off my tie (he thought i stole it from one of the mannequins) but it was mine, and he decided to give me a prop from the ride as a gift. Then we went upstairs 2 hot topic and we kept exclaiming how cool some stuff was and how we love that store, but the girl that worked there was mean to us, plus the hot topic was super small, so we left. I was sad when the dream ended, but confused. what does it mean?

20090309153716AA8arJn	Social Science;Psychology	I've honestly wrecked everything?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks
20090309154050AAnpRub	Social Science;Psychology	Should I keep up with this relationship?	My gf and i have been together for 3 months, we're happy together and we love each other. However, i have some doubts about our relationship. Over the last 3 months, she broke up with me 3 times, but she always wanted me back. However, although i love her very much, she always makes me feel sad for some reasons.       Firstly, my friends and my classmates tell me she's kinda avoiding me at school and they think that she's not comfortable around me at school, they think that she is not her usual self with me at school and as a matter of fact, we dont spend breaks together. Secondly, when i talk to her about something or she wants to talk to me about something important that concerns her, she ends up never telling me. Thirdly, i think shes hinding something from me, and she's always shy around me and i think she has more trusts in her friends and she is more open with them as well. In addition, she wants to break up with me when we graduate (we're sophomores) and i really want to be with in college but she doesnt.       so i thought to myself, why am i wasting so much with her? why am i gonna waste 2 years of my life with her if she wants to do that? and why am i still with her if i am having so many doubts about our relationship? what do u think i should do?

Is there any evidence which would show that if there were 20 kids who were brought up and isolated from society, would they turn out bi-sexual, or naturally be straight?   I'm really interested in whether being straight is the affect of conventional beliefs or if people are genuinely straight by nature.   I know that obviously they would be, but I think that everyone is a bit bi.   If there any studies similar to this?   EMZ=]

I don't think I could fall asleep right now if I tried. And all of that deep breathing crap doesn't do anything.

It's not my fault the media praises the thick-thin figure over the hourglass.  Besides, most dudes would choose Beyonce Knowles over Kate Moss any day or would choose Scarlett Johanssen over Paris Hilton.

20090309175217AAhJVBQ	Social Science;Psychology	Marijuana's effects on dreams?	I recently started smoking marijuana which everyone knows as weed.  Since I started smoking, I have extremely vivid dreams that are more realistic than any I have ever had before.  But this is only when I go to bed high (3-4 hours after smoking).  I've been looking everywhere on the web to find out more information on the subject but all of the research I've found points to people experiencing less vivid dreams, or not remembering them at all.        Has anyone else had the same experience I am having?  Or does anyone know why this is happening to me?

And, that without this "lightening process", non-white races will never be an acceptable sub-sector of society? Is this true? Thank you.

I can say most of mine seem to be at night, or the 'lighting' in them seems dimmed, maybe since its dark in the environment I'm going to sleep in, I'm not sure..      I'm always with mates I don't hang around with, in a school I left years ago or similar settings, and often going abroad. Theres sometimes some wierd stuff in their to do with being in a car driven by somebody else that loses control, often slipping off mountain edges and stuff.      Not looking for any meaning neccesarily, just what pops up in your dreams most recurrently.

20090309174520AAlHygq	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What could this mean?	I had a dream last night that I was with this guy. We were lying on a loveseat type of couch and we were holding hands in this really nice gray painted living room that was nicely lit with natural light coming from a window on the ceiling; and every time he gently rubbed his thumb on my hand as he was holding them, my stomach began to flutter (which is odd because i never physically feel anything when i'm dreaming, in fact i barely dream at all). I've been thinking about it all day and the relationship between me and this guy is we're just plain acquaintances, we use to talk alot years before but then we stopped.       What is my conscious or mind trying to tell me or what does it mean?
