Ever since they brought back the Undertaker gimmick in 2004, I've noticed that all the Undertkaer's opponents act like big puss ies. They all act scared of him. Some of them say, "I'm not scared of the Undertaker!" but they just act scared even though they say that. All of his opponents have run away. I hate it. JBL was terrible, Booker T, Randy Orton, etc. All of his opponents. Even when they are big enough not to be scared they are getting help and cheating like Khali did with the Big Show. Why are they going to have big- as s man like Khali get help and act like a coward. I wish they would have wrestlers who are totally not afraid of the Undertaker like Diesel. Diesel was messing with Undertaker all by himself. He gave the Undertkaer the finger when he interfered in his match at the Rumble. Everytime Undertaker played those mind games, Diesel would return the favor. At WrestleMania XII, Diesel was mocking the Undertaker and laughing at him after 2 jackknifes. where are opponents

Olá amigos e amigas do YR, gostaria de avisar, o que aconteceu ontem com a desclassifica??o do foguinho é normal!   O foguinho dificilmente vai para uma final.   O foguinho come?ou a disputar o carioca junto com o Flus?o e, nós temos 30 títulos, contra 18 títulos deles!  Onde está o t?o falado glorioso?   Botafogo carrega uma gera??o daquele time da década de 60, onde eles acham que foi uma linda história, coisa que n?o foi!   Esse tal time que eles dizem, n?o ganhou absolutamente nada. Cedeu jogadores para a sele??o, onde a base titular da sele??o foram jogadores do Santos!   O Santos aproveitou daquele tima?o que tinha, para ganhar o bi-campeonato da libertadores e bi-mundial, e o foguinho? N?o ganhou nada! O foguinho só conseguiu com aquele time,  02 (dois) bi-carioca, mais nada.   Em média de campeonato carioca, foguinho ganha um título em 10 em 10 anos.   O foguinho n?o era nem para estar na semifinal, se n?o fosse a ajuda do Simon!   Sauda??es Tricoloressssssssssssss!
20070524133701AAq0W6r	Sports;Football (Soccer);Brazilian Football (Soccer)	Olá amigo Filosofo!?	Amigo, lí a sua resposta e, digo que vc está completamente errado no seu raciocínio.   Vamos lá, quando o Flu disputou a série B, a torcida foi aos estádios apoiar o Flu sim! Numa manh? de domingo em solarado, o maraca lotou, tendo que abrir os port?es por ter uma multid?o do lado de fora. Todos os jogos a torcida compareceu e apoiou o time.   Para se saber se o clube tem torcedores fiéis ou n?o, tem que ser na hora da dificuldade!   Se vc acha que falar a verdade é falar besteira, desculpe, pois sou realista no que sinto.   Em real??o a torcida ser arrogante, isso é uma opini?o sua, pois a nossa torcida é educada e inteligente!   A torcida do Flu é diferente das outras!   N?o falei nenhuma besteira quando disse que o Botafogo só ganhou 18 títulos carioca, come?ando a disputar o campeoanato junto com o Flu.   N?o falei nenhuma besteira, quando disse que o Botafogo n?o ganhou nenhum título importante na década de 60.    Em rela??o ao sr, em dizer que jogou no Flu ou n?o, porque n?o sei o nome.

20090202141019AAXhTtY	Sports;Wrestling	Is WWE Wrestler Ken Kennedy Cursed (Details Inside)?	World Wrestling Entertainment Superstar Ken Kennedy is often considered one of the brightest stars on the current WWE roster. He is often viewed as the future of the WWE. However, there seems to be a dark cloud hanging over Kennedy's head. "The Kennedy Curse" seems to be a real thing, and not just a wrestling gimmick.      One of the earliest examples of "The Kennedy Curse" occurred on his first Pay-Per-View match. During the match he seriously injured fellow wrestler Hardcore Holly's ribs. Just days later he wrested Eddie Guerrero in his final televised match. During the match Kennedy hit Guerrero in the head with a steel chair. Days later Guerrero died tragically in his hotel room.      Not even a month later during his first foreign tour Kennedy suffered a severe latissimus dorsi tear. After surgery, Kennedy was forced out of the ring for nearly six months.      Kennedy's luck would change though. At Wrestlemania 23, Kennedy won The Money in the Bank match which allowed him to get a title shot whenever he wanted during the next calendar year. However he never got a chance to cash it in because he was injured during a match he was thought to have torn his right tricep muscle off of the bone. This injury forced him to relinquish his Money in the Bank briefcase to Edge in a rushed singles contest. At this same time fellow wrestler The Undertaker was injured and forced to drop his title. Instead of Kennedy cashing in his Money in the Bank, Edge did and went on to be the World Champion. Luckily Kennedy's injury was not as serious as first expected and he was back in the ring two months later.      Everything was going well in the professional life of Ken Kennedy. He was in line to be named Vince McMahon's illegitimate son on WWE programming. This storyline would have made Kennedy into a huge main event quality heel. However, those plans were changed when Kennedy was one of eleven WWE superstars suspended for violating the WWE's wellness policy. Instead, the role of Vince McMahon's illegitimate son went to Hornswoggle.      Do you think that this is really a "curse" or its just a mere Coincidense? Thanks.
20090202144116AAURO3i	Sports;Wrestling	What Happened To The Manu & Sim Snuka Storyline?	Over the past few weeks on Monday Night RAW, WWE Superstars Manu and Sim Snuka (Deuce) have not made any television appearances. They recently had a storyline going with The Legacy group, and I honestly thought that it was going to go somewhere. It was very interesting to me as well. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The storyline just dropped and when everyone thought that these two would finally get a push, they didn't. Its sad too, because in my opinion they would have been great Mid-Card Heels. But I guess they still have hope since they haven't been released yet. I think they should just go to Smackdown or ECW. Let Snuka compete on ECW since he is still trying to gain popularity and let him start a feud with DJ Gabriel or even The Boogeyman, and let Manu make his own alliance on Smackdown with his cousin Umaga.       What are your thoughts? Do you think that they will be used anytime soon or will they just become jobbers? Thanks.

This was your only shot and you failed. Time for the Eagles to get the win next year.
20090202134457AAWyesG	Sports;Football (American)	For those still going on about the last play being an incomplete pass?	The play was reviewed very quickly and was upheld, it was a fumble if you watch the play from the side a behind you can clearly tell its a fumble.      NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira confirmed that Kurt Warner fumbled on the Cardinals' last play of the Super Bowl.   Announcer Al Michaels claimed there was a quick booth review at the end and Pereira confirmed that as well. Neither Warner nor head coach Ken Whisenhunt believed there was a review and both were quite miffed about it after the game. The odds of a Hail Mary touchdown were incredibility slim, but Pereira's confirmation about the review and the fumble at least offer some closure to an epic game.       http://fantasyfootball.usatoday.com/cont...       Now you cards fans need to figure out something else to cry about.

20060904045500AA6tVVX	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (Italy)	Sarebbe giusto convocare ancora Totti?	Breve riepilogo:   Prima del mondiale Totti ha detto che a fine mondiale si sarebbe ritirato dalla Nazionale. Dopo il mondiale ha detto che avrebbe dovuto parlarne con la moglie. Poi ha detto che doveva pensarci per un pò.   La cosa che però mi ha fatto irritare è stata l'ultima: Ha detto che torna in Nazionale ma solo "quando gli va" (non ha usato questi termini ma ha reso questa idea) e comunque non prima del 2007.   In pratica secondo lui non è Donadoni che deve scegliere quando chiamarlo in Nazionale e quando no ma è lui che deve scegliere quando vuole andarci e quando no.   Vi pare giusto convocarlo ancora?   Vi pare corretto nei confronti degli altri?   A me non pare proprio corretto che lui si metta a fare il divo.   O dai la tua disponibilità o ti ritiri dalla Nazionale.   Io non lo chiamerei più nemmeno per tutto l'oro del mondo.   P.s.: Con questo non voglio mettere in dubbio la sua classe, per chi non l'abbia capito...

20090412093653AAiM40m	Sports;Running	Running A Slower Pace?	My girlfriend and I are looking forward to completing our first marathon together coming end-May. We're hoping just to complete the marathon, without any concern for timings.With only a month and half to go, she runs only 17km a week, and I am very worried that the lack of mileage will result in an injury during the marathon.      We do our weekly long run together. So far the LR distance is 10km. I run behind her, so that I can get comfortable with her pace.      I usually do an easy 10km during my own trainings in 45 minutes or less. However, when I started running behind her, we took almost 1h 40minutes to complete the 10km. The pace was so slow, I had to take really really short and slow strides. I wasn't able to land properly due to the slow speed. There were times I felt inclined to brisk walk because it was much "faster", but decided not to since it would lower her morale.      Normally, I would feel no pain after doing the 10km on my own. I could even run the next day without any problems.       However, the next day after that long run together, my feet, calves and thighs were extremely painful.       I hope that some experienced runner can advise me on how to run her pace.      Thank you.

20061224220930AAVKKRF	Sports;Basketball	Don't you hate how much media coverage the Knicks get?	The Knicks are horrible. The Hawks and the Bobcats are horrible and don't get a tenth of the coverage the Knicks get. The Knicks don't even have a great history, like say the Yankees. The Knicks have won two NBA titles in 60 years for Christ's sake and haven't won one since 1973.     I don't even want to hear about that biggest media market nonsense because their games are beginning to be played in front of empty arenas. I don't think they would even have enough fans to riot if ESPN cut off all their Knick coverage.

20061206105252AAJ6bAj	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Looking for advice.....RB dilemma?	My RB's are as followed:   Chester Taylor(MIN) @ Detroit,    Kevin Jones(DET) @ Min,    Thomas Jones(CHI) @ STL,    Edgerrin James(ARI) @ SEA      My workhorses have been Kevin and Chester. James as we all know has been a complete flop, where Thomas Jones has been ok but not exceptional in fantasy points. Common sense to me says to go with Taylor and Kevin Jones. Problem is Taylor is questionable with rib problems. I have to have my line up in Thursday and it is doubtful that there will be a definate answer as to whether he is playing or not. So my next thought is to go to both Jones because James has been awful except for last week. This is the beginning of the playoffs for me and playing a strong #1 ranked team. Just looking for advice to see if anyone has a different thought about who I should start.
