20090307075828AAd4pfQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Novel in progress - opinions please.?	Please comment on my writing - style, grammar, is it interesting? Dull? Anything you want to say as long as it's the truth! Thanks.      Robin put down the phone and pushed his fingers through his hair. Let’s just hope this doesn’t reach the papers, he thought as he patted about for his cigarettes. Cheryl came in then, handed him an ashtray and a lit cigarette.   “She’s coming here,” he said and sat down, his knees spread, his hands between them cradling the ashtray.   “Oh.”     He looked up at her. They’d had barely six weeks together. It was her house. He didn’t even have a room of his own to write in yet.  It was something they’d talked about, had settled on extending into the right hand u-shape of the barn. He didn’t know how to ask her if his daughter could come. Where’s she’d sleep. How they’d be, with her here.   “There’s the bed in the eaves room,” said Cheryl. “She can have that.  We’ll tell her it’s her room, that it was what we’d been planning all along.”   “Really? You don’t mind?”   “Well, it will certainly be different, with her here. But she’s your daughter, darling. I don’t think we have a choice, do you?”   Robin looked up at Cheryl.   “But how will Fiona take it, do you think? I mean, they’re not exactly friends.”   “Well, we don’t have to worry about that for a week or so. She doesn’t come up till the end of the month. Then she’ll be busy with the Pony Club and dance practise. I doubt they’ll see much of each other.”   Robin pictured Fiona and was not reassured. She was spending the first half of the summer holidays with her father in Surrey but when he’d last seen her at Easter he was aware that Fiona’s perfect heart-shaped face, gazelle legs and glossy dark hair that cascaded down her back contrasted cruelly with Daisy’s puppy fat and freckles.    “I suppose not,” he said. “But I wonder what happened to make Daisy leave.” He took a deep drag of his cigarette. “The thing is, Ellen’s been so wrapped up in her own selfishness, it could be anything. I’d better call her. See what she has to say about it though I doubt I’ll get the truth.”   There was a clink as Cheryl put the stopper back in the decanter. She came to his elbow with another whisky.   “Here,” she said. “You might need it.”   There was no reply. Ellen had already left and was on a plane to Glasgow – something Robin would later wish he’d known before entering the melee that greeted Daisy at Edinburgh’s Waverley Station. He felt outmanoeuvred. For a start, the police were there when he’d expressly told them he would deal with it, a pursed-mouthed lady in a hat fussed around Daisy as if she were a stray dog and Daisy, who stood there in a red rugger shirt and little else, looked like a Lolita.  When told that Ellen was waiting at Glasgow airport and they were to catch the next plane back she crumpled up her face and threw out such a torrent of childish invective that the Police and the little old lady stared aghast at the small creature from whose lips it came. Robin tried to take control of the situation by drawing her to him, hoping to muffle the noise she was making in the worsted of his jacket.

20090307080103AAJnAQp	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem okay?  I have edited it twice, does it make more sense?  Critiques welcomed!?	Waking Up      A flame burns deep within   few have ever known.  Hidden   from world, yearning to escape.   Waiting to be seen...you   fan the embers into roaring fire.      Your devices, words; passion unheard,   flooding over me, wellsprings emerge   I pour out on you as waves over the sea;   dry parched lands, drenched by my love.      Covering of joy, overcoming barriers   not afraid to show such passion to all.   Tingling ignites throughout my being;   knowing you are near, close to the tapping...   your warmth engulfs me--I disappear.   Stronger I become, obstacles defeated.      Fingertips lightly touch my soul like a painter   brushes canvas, gently colouring my world dream hues.   Eyes wide open breathing in your embrace,   encompassed by your wings, protection from harm.   Desire satiated, passion fans the flames   raging through my heart.      Soaring above clouds, running through   streets--golden pure, held by your love;   all pain........falls away.      Waking from this vision set before my eyes,   I feel you inside--our hearts beat in time.   Jasmine fills my senses, a smile curls   my lips, to kiss you would be to die;   reside on heaven's shores.  Embraced by   your love that stretches beyond time and space.   Strength rises -- my pen begins to write.      What words could be found   to describe my love to others...   his eyes like pure emeralds   cheeks as rubies red   Wisdom beyond the ancients   strong arms gently lift me up   soft and warm they wrap me   I meld into him      where do I begin~where does he end?

Come, thrust your hands in the warm earth    And feel her strength through all your veins;    Breathe her full odors, taste her mouth,    Which laughs away imagined pains;    Touch her life's womb, yet know    This substance makes your grave also.      Shrink not; your flesh is no more sweet    Than flowers which daily blow and die;    Nor are your mein and dress so neat,    Nor half so pure your lucid eye;    And, yet, by flowers and earth I swear    You're neat and pure and sweet and fair.          ---I was wondering if anybody could paraphrase this poem for me??

20090307064319AA8BoZ0	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I read this poem and like it, what do you think of it?	Do you recall it's name,    As it suggested beck and call.      This face and heel,    Will drag your halo through the mud,       Ash of Pompeii,   Erupting in a statues dust.       Shrouded in veils,    Because these handcuffs hurt to much       Still scalpeing these ticketless applause.    And when they drag the lake there is nothing left at all.    Sutured contusion.       Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague,    I've lost my way.       Even if this cul de sac would pay,    to reach inside a vault whatever be the cost,    when they drag the lake there's nothing left at all...

20090307073410AANYye8	Arts & Humanities;History	Tell me what is this Charter about?  Is this a bunch of baloney i.e.?	deceptive talk or what?                   www.elementalethics.com      One Voice Charter. (This jargon is used to control and confuse  teachers.)       This paper represents a segment of discovery observed through dissertation research.   1 The current focus, herein, specifically conveys the vital need for a pedagogy of language that enables educators as well as students to negotiate Self and Other through communication and dialogue within a    unique speech community formed in classroom dynamics. More precisely, a gap exists demonstrating the    lack of vision in recognizing that educators are Interpersonal Communicative Practitioners within    classroom communities of speech. This absence of understanding the critical role of communicative    connection is reflected in classrooms around this country from K-12, and within colleges and universities.    Most disastrous, is the loss of opportunities to improve educational and social inequities through effective    communication practices and action. The breadth of research investigated crosses all academic    disciplines; with a concentration on communicative studies, sociology of language, education theories,    cultural, critical, race, sex-gender studies, as well as emancipatory pedagogy and praxis. The topic is    much too vast for a comprehensive discussion herein. Therefore, fundamental research and experiential    knowledge concerning the role of educators as Interpersonal Communicative Practitioners is    demonstrated. Pivotal areas include: Understanding and Negotiating Self and Other, Ritual of Social    Interaction, Classroom Communities of Speech and Emancipatory Pedagogy and Praxis.    -------------------------------------     In my opinion: This charter is composed in words (jargon) that  pretend to be intelligent and knowledgeable but are really meant to confuse and guide the Teachers/Educators away from authentic and real reform.  It is the same strategy and jargon that the bureaucrats, educational psychologist and the Feds used, for many decades, to confuse the Teachers/Educators and to keep them under their thumbs.  www.elementalethics.com

Please only give me ideas, not something that you wrote.      Waiting at the front porch was an older lady, probably in her 50’s, waving at me and dad and mom frantically. I hoped that this woman wouldn’t be caring for me while my parents were on their ‘business trip’. And I got my spirit’s up way to high.       Up close, the woman didn’t look as ugly as  I had imagined. Her slightly gray hair was braided cascading down her back and was wearing a midnight blue turtle neck with a pair of jeans.        “Hi, Rylee. I’m Marla, you’re great aunt. I will be babysitting you until your mommy and daddy get back. Okay?” Marla sounded like a peppy preschool teacher introducing herself, making me almost want to vomit. It wasn’t a very good first impression if that was what she was trying to do.       “Come one inside. We can have some mint tea.” she said, motioning for us, the Romano’s, to follow her.          That's were I get stuck...

Her soothing sound made my heart and soul sing,   With Curiosity that filled my mind,   I took a step; that’s when I saw the Ring,    With shock, right words to speak I couldn’t find.       Tears at the sight, the ring on her finger,   She was the girl, the one I vowed to love,   To love forever, the lovely singer,   She saw me, I saw a smile, a white dove.      Forgiven for the fight we had before,   I promised her we’d quarrel no more.

20090307075530AAGQqbF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Did you ever have Winter winds like this....?	Winter, early and hungry that year   Whipped its winds down out of Canada       Through the emptied horn of plenty in the heartland    they looked to devour everything.       The winds fed on human’s waning enthusiasm,    chasing them inside and  turned on the remaining    life and vitality left in fall life       Eagerly sampling iced apple cider, crackling    corn bundles & gourds and squashes.       The winds named Jack O’ Lantern the favorite,   interpreting it as a carved sacrifice, as they    whistled in and out of its head. The frozen eviscerated    and sterile Jacks, repetitiously screamed, frowned    or smiled silently as their slow decomposition into    a state of mush was postponed.      Greedy winds desiring  humans after spying them    through windows, themselves died, when they hit    the glass pane. Their residue transformed to crystals    as a warning to others.  Simply stupid winds that snuck    up on heavily bundled humans out of doors, thinking they    caught them unawares, were simply vaporized by the energy    engines contained in each human as they tried to enter their    noses and mouths.       When the winds had fed enough they settled down    all in and around the houses for a slumber of five or    so months and only woke occasionally to snatch a snack.

I haven't said anything about you ever,   To my husband, or friend, or to my lover,   I've never kissed a droplet of water,   To embrace the sun within it,   The way I have touched you once,   Oh, heavens, Oh, God,   What dearship is me and you,   Together is, together it be,   Together brings,   A miracle apart,   To rain on me in thousands.   Gold and rubies, and alabaster,   Your eyes are a flight to the top,   To the source.    The incredible eyes I've seen.

20090307081401AAHQ5YE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Magical Ideas For My Novel (Two Q's In One)?	OK - I planned pretty much everything for my current novel, but right from the beginning there was one bit that made sense but I just can't think of something that fits.       So here goes...my budding young villain, who is a 'chosen-one' type figure, has the ability to 'imagine' things into existence. This basically means that if he sees something in his mind, let's say a person coming back to life, then it happens in real life. The villain's path is parallel to the hero's, but I just can't think of an ability for the hero that would make the villain's power to imagine things into being. Does anyone have any suggestions?       Also, I am now coming to the end of the novel, but each day more ideas come into my head for the characters' lives. Would it be silly to start a sequel? I'm not trying to get it published just yet - I write because it's my passion, and even though it sounds a little sad I've become so attached to my characters I don't want to let them go just yet! Should I just carry the story on with a sequel?      (Sorry about the length of this question). (All Ideas in this question copyright to me)

Here's a bit about me, maybe you can think of something and help me out.   I'm 23 yrs old now. My mother abandoned me when I was 6 months. My father got custody of me and my older sister and dumped us with his parents. He never hugged me or said he was proud. Actually, it openly showed how much I disappointed and disgusted him. He got married and my new step mother was a ***** beyond words. She hated that he had kids from another marriage. Usually she tried to keep a fake life, pretending that she was like Martha Stuwart. Like a loving mother. It was sickening. She loved her little dog more than us. my sister and i were sitting at the table and eating slowly. She walked in and said "Hurry up and eat or your going to bed hungry" then she turned to her dog and in a baby voice said "Come on Oz Oz, eat your din din".  That's how it always was. My dad had a temper too. He would hit me and beat me whenever he felt too. I was a bad kid, I didn't want to go to school or clean my room but that doesn't always mean 'hit me with a belt'. Most of the time, I was in my grandparents house being raised by them. But when I was bad they would send me to live with my father for a week. He lived in the same town but I could go months without hearing from him. My mother was never around. She moved from place to place.  I guess a word you would use for her was 'flighty' or 'flake'. She had many other kids with other guys. She never wanted to live in the same state at us. Saying she just looved the weather in so-so state. Also, she keep a million pets. She was a great best friend but I wouldn't ever put her in a catergory with other mothers. I was the black sheep of my family. Alot of people were saying that I wasn't my father's daughter. That I didn't know who my father was. They actually still say that. I dropped out of HS because I was failing most classes and started skipping school to hang out with friends. It wasn't that I wasn't smart enough, it was that I didn't think I could do it. My entire life I was 'wrong'. everyone in my family said that I was wrong about everything. I didn't speak portugese right to my grandparents (who didn't speak english) even though they understood me. or I had no fashion sense, Or that I wouldn't be able to do anything in life. They said I wouldn't even make a good dish washer in a resturant. I was never told "You can do anything you set your mind too".  Eventually I grew up to now. My father had 2 boys with my step mother. I love them so much. my grandmother got sick a few years ago. She had a brain tumor for 5 yrs and her doctor never found it. She died 3 months after we found it. I couldn't handle it when she was sick. I was living in the house alone. My grandfather in the hospital with her and my sister living with her boyfriend. I was to stay home and take care of the calls. That and babysit my brothers who were toddlers at the time. I wasn't allowed to act sad around them. So I had to live in a house alone and think about how the woman who raised me is dying and then go to my father's house and play and pretend like nothing is wrong. one day I called over and said I couldn't watch them that day. that I couldn't pretend, I was too sad. I was told that it was my fault that my brother poked himself with a epi-pen (he's allergic to eggs) and was taken to the hospital. My father said that because I wasn't watching them, it happened. It was my fault my brother almost died. I had left them with their mother! how was it my fault? I couldn't take it so I moved in with my boyfriend who had another girlfriend on the side. I was completely cut out of the family. No one talked to me. I lived a town away but it might as well been another world. I went to my grandmother's funeral, where I got dirty looks in the church and stood in the back of everyone in the cemetary. The only thing someone said to me was "so you finally showed up" by my grandfather. a year pasted and my boyfriend found that that his father wasn't paying the mortgage on the house they shared. the house was going to ruin because of how old it was and he kept raising the rent and asking us to pay the oil and mortgage. Eventually he moved out and evicted us. We had nowhere to go so my grandfather took us in. He said it was because my grandmother said to help all the grandkids. a few months after we moved in my boyfriend gets taken to court by the town we lived in because of the house being a danger because of how broken it was. That's when my boyfriend found out that his father put his name on the deed and morgage to the house. so we were evicted from a house my boyfriend partly owned!  now he has a foreclosure on his name and he's only 28. we had to get rid of our dog which was mostly my only friend. we had to leave most of our things behind because there was no room in my grandfather's house. my boyfriend's car got repoed because he got behind on bil

This poem or whatever you call it is dedicated to a child when he/she separated from his/her parents and joints a poster family.          Life in foster family      Joining the foster family, a new life begins   You don’t know what to expect next   But to hope for the best, thinking   How will I be treated?   How will I be cared for?   But assuming it as though being with mom      Giddy, got up in the morning, confused and embarrassed   Where am I?   But I hear an unfamiliar voice calling,   You are late for the school!   Got up quickly, and a bit nervous   Though not because of the school      For the first few days, you see the smile on her face   And slowly, this begins to disappear   As usual you sleep at night, and then the dream comes   A dream, when I was with mom and dad   For a while I find myself being with them   Laughing and having funs      Later, got up in a strange place, feel lost and lonely   Now, last night’s dreams stayed in mind   The whole day at school   And it continually stays for the next weeks, months and ever   I can’t rinse it away          As time passes on, people tell me, why I become quieter and less talkative   And I say this is the way I am   But they say no   This is the way you have become   But do I realize the difference?      Sometime I go out for shopping   And then I see people and things around   I see them holding their kids, them being with their parents   They laugh and busy in pleasure of life though,    They don’t notice me   For a while, I close my eyes and picture myself with mom and dad   And soon, the fate of life knocks me up      7. Now here that her moods keep changing   I can’t do anything I want   I am asking to myself why?   Am I a bad kid?   But I hear a voice says, it’s her house role         Sometime, you have something good and want tell her   When you go, you see a different face, telling you    You have not done this and that   And then soon you forget what you wanted to say   But, will mom ever understand this one day?         As usual I go to school, hoping   If, I ever meet mom again, so that one day I can make her proud   Though, sometime its fun and sometime boring, but to keep on going   As time passes on, got the exam results, though at present mom’s feeling could not be expressed    And to say ahh! Well done my son      Now says she, sit down you big boy   And learn how to live an independent life!   But, don’t I deserve some joy in life?   Now, that I have grown up, what has this life to give me back?   Happiness, my childhood or what?

Are there any paragraphs or sentences that are particularly powerful?      How well does Ehrenreich use outside research to provide a larger context for her personal narrative?

20090307082004AAYkubM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing Erotica fiction professionally. Is this literary genre popular?	I have recently read The Delta Venus by Anais Nin and am further inspired to write Erotica, although it seems this genre is frowned upon or overlooked by more 'sophisticated' literature. Can anyone advise me on whether one can make a living out of this sort of writing? According to consensus, most women find 'sexy' novels to be trashy; I think this is an unfair portrait as Anais Nin as proven. If one can make the style of writing poetically 'sexy' to compliment the scene then perhaps such novels would be more widely read. Any thoughts appreciated and thanks in advance!

For instance let's say I have my reason for life being very spiritual but refuse to believe in the religion and the bunch of b.s. that's out there.  How come some ppl can feel what Im saying but still feel like I can go to hell or elsewhere for my thoughts, when just a minute they were feeling my thoughts but try to dismiss them as no possible way. They believe but they don't want to believe.         Also for speaking your mind say it was something ppl said they would want to do and never did. However it was somebody that said they was going to do something and did it, now they're the scum of the earth or all this crazy stuff. Why is it like that?

20090307100536AAVfbLk	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is the only thing we can do is sit and wait patiently?	It seems like almost everything we do we create good and bad effects. We correct a persons action because we are concerned and we push them away. We try to help them when they are having a hard time and they eventually want us to leave them alone and stop trying to help them. We try to make peoples lives more safe and in the process they say we are invading their privacy. We give money to the poor and they will sometimes use it for reasons we would not approve. We try to give welfare to the needy and people exploit it. We offer change to the church we go to and then there is the possibility it gets built up and becomes corrupt. We help out a friend with a ride and they take advantage of us and keep on asking for rides then get upset when we can't. We try to force people to do what is right and they either keep doing it because they have no moral reason not to or they become worse. Is it possible that we should just leave the world to its own devices, sit, wait patiently, in peace, with closed mouths in public, and just move away to a quiet restful place in nature with the wind and the trees?

It was a light shade of orange and the clouds were crowding around it. The girl was in trouble, and I don’t mean trouble like not doing your home work. I mean trouble like taking a precious amulet from a museum in the middle of the night. So as the girl ran from the security guards and their dogs, she checked that the amulet was still in her shoulder bag, and kept running. The girl was called Jade, after her incredibly green as the grass in the summer eyes. If she’d had hair when she was born she may have been called Ebony. For her hair was as black as the furthest reaches of space. The lips on her face were as red as in centre of the earth. Her long black hair came down to her waist as she could never afford to have it cut. She wore a pure white dress the came to her ankles and boots muddy brown.      2.

20090307094634AAQX4Rh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play/script that i am writing?	this play/script is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.   --   excerpt 2: it is soon revealed that the person who had muramasas blade was a student of a still living muramasa. the priest was revealed to be masamune, and he was killed by muramasa. here hayate confronts muramasa.
20090307094557AAyYKkP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fast that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090307090914AAJF9q3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The start of my novel. Opinions please?	This is the opening to my novel. If it's badly written, or dull, I want to know. Or does it slowly draw you in (there's not an obvious hook, I know). Grammar, sentence construction and structure - I want to know what you think. Please be honest. Thank you!      She laid out the colourful skeins of embroidery threads in systematic rows according to colour, shade and depth, until the surface of the table was covered in gleaming silks. An inch of pale oak separated the groups of assorted skeins so the table was now a luminous patchwork, the blocks of colour vivid in the shabby room. In the corner, her mother, still agile, was kneeling hunched over the shears as they sliced through fabric, faded soft cotton-lawn pyjamas, crisp cotton skirts long since outgrown, the fronts and backs and sleeves of her dead husband’s well-worn shirts, confidently cutting triangles, rectangles, squares and diamonds, all by eye. Her mother did not cut curves. The overall design and pattern was achieved by arranging precise geometric shapes only. If a curve were required she would combine rectangles, triangles and squares, overlapping where necessary (which only added substance to the quilting) to give the clever illusion of a gradual arc. But the component parts were always precisely cut angular shapes. She was not an artist. She couldn’t draw a likeness with pencil or paint but she could work coloured threads and fabric expertly by hand using tiny stitches meticulously placed with the dual purpose of joining together the small pieces of fabric in pleasing colour combinations by means of intricate hand quilting on the reverse that was decorative and unique.     They worked silently, concentrating on their tasks. The only sounds the steady familiar rasp of the scissors’ rhythmic action and the gentle hiss and crackle of the ray-burn stove, it’s humid warmth permeating the room. Daisy, the daughter, wants to be only that - her mother’s daughter, at this moment, on this day.  Today, and over the last few days, she is seeking a return to something she has lost.  Her mother instinctively knows this – there has been little conversation between them – and the stillness is comforting to them both.   Having finished sorting the skeins of thread, Daisy sits gazing at all the myriad colours laid on the table.  She takes her time choosing three toning shades of crimson and tucks them swiftly up her sleeve. She rises and pads across the worn flagstones to the door at the far edge of the room. With a fleeting glance towards her mother she snibs the door quietly shut and tiptoes up the stairs to her room. It is not really her room but the room where she has recently stayed, here, at her mother’s house. Now, because it alone is unchanged in her life, it feels more familiar to her than any other room, anywhere.     The bed with its cold iron frame could remind her of school, but doesn’t - the quilt, chequered with brilliant azure and blues from duck egg to clear turquoise, trellis-stitched with hundreds of deep blue diamond-shaped pillows, removes any association there might have been. She wonders if her mother knows how fashionable the room is now, the original time-darkened boards varnished and scattered with two well-worn rugs. A pine chest sits under the sloping planes of the window recess, and on it stands an old French mirror, framed by ornate gilding that is chipped and flaking. Daisy opens one of the small drawers and pulls it fully out till it meets the stop. She bends her wrist upwards to stretch her fingers towards the back, feeling for the tapestry needle and the small pair of needlework scissors, stuck to the underside of the top of the chest with sticky tape, that she had hidden there years before. They’re still there, as she knew they would be. She puts the needle between her teeth and with the scissors dangling from one finger, lifts the mirror and places it on the floor to one side of the window recess.  She puts the scissors and the three skeins of silk next to it on the floor. Crossing over to the bed, she tugs at the quilt and drags it across the boards to where daylight floods the room. She lays it carefully on the floor and, sitting cross-legged, drapes the quilt over her knees and now she’s inside a cosy envelope. She takes the needle from her lips and places it carefully on the floating table of multicoloured silk that tents across her knees. Her hair is tucked behind her ears in a swift unconscious movement. She shifts forward to where daylight hits the mirror and peers at her image as, one by one she begins to remove her piercings.

20090307100408AAMajBc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good intro to a book I'm writing?	I didn't spend much time on it so there are probably a bunch of grammatical errors, but tell me what you think?      “I heard this school is supposed to have the best soccer team in the city,” My father said awkwardly, “You like soccer, right Alice?”    “No,” I mumbled. I had been living with my father for three years now and he knew absolutely nothing about me. I was nine when my parents got divorced. I was never close to my father so, naturally, I lived with my mom. Four years later my mother killed herself. No suicide note, no warnings, no goodbyes. I was angry at first. Betrayed that she would leave me by myself. She was the strings holding me to the ground, the very air I breathed. She was my world, and without her I was nothing. I moved in with my father immediately after her death. When I got there, I was stone: Broken inside but cold on the surface. Still, time moved on, and I had no choice but to move with it.     My father was quiet. I think my mother’s death affected him more than he let on. He never really seemed to heal from that wound, sitting still as time lagged on. That is, until he met Julie, a beautiful blonde with lip injections. He followed her to Los Angeles, California where they got married. She was nice enough, I suppose. She didn’t really pay much attention to me, but I didn’t care. I had to give her some credit though, because after she married my father, he began try to be the father he never was.    “There it is,” he said as we drove by a dreadfully cheery looking building with a big sign saying, “Welcome to Sunshine High School.”     “Oh,” was all I could say. Who, in their right mind, would paint a school canary yellow? “It looks…great.” I lied.    “I think it’s charming!” He said happily.    I closed my eyes and sank deeper into my seat. This is going to be fun, I thought.

20090307092500AAtYoOr	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Making a theatrical adaptation of Lord of the Flies, need a hut prop?	So here we go, I gotta make a theatrical adaptation of Lord of The Flies, but you can help me out here even if you haven't read it.  I need to make a hut that I can bring on stage.  Not anything fancy or over the top.  And my play will only be about 4 minutes long, so the only real requirement is that my audience can recognize it as a hut/shelter.  I was considering using a small tent, but I'm not sure if I can get my hands on one.  The best part is that the hut is supposed to be rickety and unstable, so even if it doesn't stand on its own, it's fine.  Any ideas?      If you have read the book, I have to act out the scene where Simon and Ralph are struggling to make the last hut while all the other boys are off playing.

Hey, I'm really trying to find some old adventure puzzle style books from my childhood, back in the mid 90's or so. I can not remember the name of them for the life of me but I distinctly remember the main character being a chimp/monkey and each book had a different setting, for instance I know one was definetly in a haunted fun fair/fairgound, another set in space and I think one in a tower/castle place. I remember the artwork being great - one reason why I want to find them. If anyone has any suggestions or has a clue to what I am talking about and remembers them I would be gratefull!      Cheers

Now I just have a few questions about it.   1. Should we criticize the criminal justice system of Unuofia?   2. Should Okonkwo be considered one of the heroes in African life?   3. Should women and children have been considered as "oppressed" and "abused" in ancient Ibo society?   4. Was Okonkwo's fate the result of his chi?   5. Do people really learn from proverbs?   6. Do the people of Umuofia suffer because of the Europeans?   7. Was polygamy necessary for the economy of Umuofia?   8. Would Things Fall Apart be equally effective without Okonwko's violent behavior?   9. Do the people of Umuofia successfully respect life?   10. Do the people consider the individual above the community?   11. Were the Umuofians as a group better off before the British came or after their arrival?    Support for your answers would be nice. Thank you in advance!! :)

As a young boy, I remember reading a children's book about a witch who goes to a witches' convention. IIRC, she lives on her own in a cottage in the woods. One day, she receives a letter asking her to attend a witching convention, so she sets off on her broomstick, flying through the night with her belongings and her black cat. At the convention, she attends all kinds of courses, such as cat obedience classes.      It’s been a very long time since I read it, but I’d love to find the title again to read to my 6-year old daughter.      Thanks for answering!

20090307102141AAvYFwh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my friends story so far?	My friend is writing a story, and she wants to know what people think of it so far. Keep in mind its not finished.      When is that stupid brat going to wake up?             My mom hated me. It was a returned feeling. She tried to act nice to me. She didn’t know I could hear everything she was thinking about me. I wasn’t normal. I liked books and nature instead of TV and the internet. It wasn’t my fault that I had a brain.                 My mother wanted a spoiled little brat from California. She wanted me to be one of the people I hated. Hearing everyone’s thoughts made me think differently. I refused to be like superficial people in any way, shape or form.                 My mom had a whiney voice, even when she tried to be sweet. “Esme dear, come down for breakfast!” - you stupid useless thing.      Was the last part really necessary? I sighed and went into the bathroom. My stupid mom could wait for me to pee, at least. As I was washing my hands I looked in the mirror.  I hated mirrors. They were always showing me an image that made me want to cry. I had light skin – but it wasn’t light enough. My eyes were almost pretty - a silvery blue, but one of them was all squinty. I had a good facial structure but it was too round in some parts. I hated my height. I was a wimpy 5’3” and a sophomore. I left the bathroom before I started crying.      It’s about time that girl got down here! “Good morning darling, your breakfast was getting cold. I hope you don’t mind the early wake up call.” She showed one of her fakest smiles yet. I stomped out of the kitchen. I couldn’t stand her mental rudeness. And the fact that she tried to hide it! Ugh.      I trudged into the forest. I just needed some time alone. I was sick of my mother and everyone else. I turned up my already blaring music and continued deeper into the woods. I thought about weird things while I was walking. I wished that people were thinking the same things they were always saying. But no, everyone was always criticizing in their minds. Everyone hated each other. Even the people who were friends. I hated all of the evilness that went around. School was hell for me.                 All I wanted was to be tall, thin and beautiful. I knew I was smart. I also knew that I was short and fat. My thoughts on beauty were quite different from most peoples. I thought pale skin was much better than tan skin. Being tan made people look ill. Like they ate too many carrots or something. And the only thing that would go good with pale skin was black hair. Not dark brown or dark red – black. Sometimes someone would think about beauty in the same way. Until they thought about the eyes. It was always black. Eyes shouldn’t be black. The best color for eyes was green. Electric, glowing green. Everyone should know that.                 I was humming along to my favorite part of a song when a tree caught my attention. Normally, nothing could distract me on my walks. But this tree was different. There was a door on it. And it wasn’t just an ordinary door. The rim of it was emanating some kind of bluish glow. I was so intrigued that I stepped over to the tree to get a closer look. The bark looked real enough. So why was it glowing? I couldn’t stand not knowing so I reached out to touch it. The second my finger met the bark, the door vanished. It dissolved right into the bluish glow. Something about the glow made me want to touch it. It seemed like the blueness would make me happy. So I stuck my finger into it.                The feeling was amazing.                 It was as if every cell in my finger was made of pure happiness. My finger became my hand. My hand became my whole arm. Until eventually, my whole face was inside the tree. It was the best I’d ever felt in my entire life. I wanted to feel that way forever. So, without thinking, I jumped right into the tree – and fell.                 The happy feeling was gone. I suddenly realized the stupid mistake I’d just made. I knew I was falling and that I had to land eventually. I was not looking forward to that part.       Cruuuunch.                Every inch of my body felt the crash. I could feel warmth running to the tingly places. I could feel a mangled, stinging mess in my ankle. I could feel my arms going numb. But when I looked to see the damage, there was nothing there. Not a scratch. I didn’t scream because I hated attracting attention to myself. If a girl was found in the bottom of a tree, people would definitely come to see. I tried to stand up, but the pain was too much. How could nothing be showing up on me? Was I just imagining it? I finally let out a little groan of pain. Then a blue light came out a tunnel. I instantly felt better. No more pain. It was like the blue glow had a healing power or something. Two more lights came in. Then I saw them.                They were people – sort of. I couldn’t hear their thoughts and that frightened me. I felt vulnerable. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. They all had unnaturally smooth pale skin t
