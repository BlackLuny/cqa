20080103103937AAeFjWk	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	?Depresión infrasónica?	Es muy interesante, el otro día leí sobre una nueva teoría acerca de algunos tipos de depresión humana sobretodo en las ciudades.      Parece que existen puntos clave en las ciudades en donde los niveles de ruido infrasónico son tan altos que hacen que el cuerpo y la mente reaccionen con mucha fatiga y con alta depresión (sin sentido aparente).      Saben algo del tema, se puede medir de alguna forma no tan complicada la cantidad de infrasonido en la casa por ejemplo, o en el trabajo.

20080124103416AAdU9WV	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Leche no, gracias??????	Desde peque?os nos han dicho que consumir leche es algo sano e imprescindible; incluso, algunos van más allá diciendo que si no consumimos leche y sus derivados estamos en un grave riesgo de padecer enfermedades que nos pueden llevar hasta una completa desnutrición y futura muerte. Toda esta teoría se refuerza aún más si le sumamos los millones y millones de dólares que invierten las empresas involucradas en la Industria Láctea en todo tipo de publicidad: televisión, radio, letreros, gigantografías, internet, etc. (solo es cosa de recordar la fuerte campa?a publicitaria en que aparecían famosos diciendo "yo tomo leche"). Sin quedarse conformes con la inversión en publicidad, destinan recursos para pagarle a sospechosos (por decir lo menos) médicos para que salgan en los spots informándonos sobre el nuevo producto de tal o cual empresa lechera.      En resumen, existe una inversión millonaria desde hace ya un buen tiempo por parte de estos grupos económicos que se benefician del consumo de lácteos. ?Qué busca esta gran inversión?, pues bien, cubrir un objetivo esencial: la desinformación sistemática de la sociedad respecto a las carentes propiedades nutritivas de la leche, los elevados índices de toxinas que presentan y la verdad respecto a las crueles prácticas de las actuales Industrias Lecheras.      La vida de una vaca lechera   Si tú eres una de las personas que evitan el consumo de carnes por razones éticas, ya que tú al igual que nosotros consideras que consumir carne es moralmente incorrecto producto de que para la obtención de un trozo de ella es necesario utilizar crueles mecanismos que implican un sufrimiento despiadado hacia los animales de crianza intensiva, con mayor razón deberías evitar el consumo de la leche y todos sus derivados, ya que es la industria láctea como así también la industria de los huevos , las que más sufrimiento causan a millones de animales en todo el mundo.      Mientras que los medios de comunicación nos siguen mostrando la hipócrita imagen de que las vacas lecheras viven libremente en las praderas, felices junto a sus crías pastando en la tranquilidad de las monta?as (como ciertos spots televisivos), todas ellas son criadas en deplorables condiciones: hacinamiento, suciedad, orde?o intensivo, mala alimentación, embarazos forzados, administración de hormonas, antibióticos y tranquilizantes, etc. La vaca lechera moderna es criada, alimentada, medicada, inseminada y manipulada para un solo fin: producir más y más leche.      Producto del desarrollo tecnológico, actualmente ya no se utiliza el "orde?o manual" , sino que el llamado "orde?o mecánico", el cual permite orde?ar a los animales 2 ó 3 veces al día, de esta forma la producción media de una vaca de granja intensiva alcanza aproximadamente unos 4.000 litros anuales, y sin conformarse la industria sigue buscando nuevos procedimientos para aumentar estas cifras.      Este sistema excesivo además de ser muy doloroso y molesto, provoca heridas, inflamación e infecciones en las ubres, lo cual obliga a la industria a administrar medicamentos y antibióticos; los cuales permanecerán en el vaso de leche que usted ha de beber.      En su estado normal, las vacas no dan leche todo el tiempo (como es la creencia de muchas personas). Las vacas tienen que parir para producir leche, leche que debería ser el alimento de su cría. Sin embargo, para mantener elevada la producción de leche, las industrias fuerzan a las vacas a tener un embarazo cada a?o. Esto se hace porque tras el parto la producción es máxima y podrá ser orde?ada intensivamente durante aproximadamente 10 meses hasta el siguiente embarazo. Lo anterior se realiza mediante inseminación artificial o por implante de embrión.      Por otro lado, los terneros son removidos del lado de sus madres apenas nacen, lo que les causa a ambos una profunda depresión.      Los terneros son encerrados en corrales especiales con suelo de cemento o metal. Sus jaulas solo les permiten estar de pie o estirados, ni siquiera pueden darse la vuelta. Estos terneros son mal nutridos y la mayoría padece anemia ; no se les permite moverse, ya que si hicieran ejercicio y se alimentaran de mejor forma, la carne para servir en el plato se tornaría más oscura y dura , por supuesto, esto es lo último que desearía el productor.      Para obtener un ternero gordo y débil en el menor tiempo posible, el productor lo alimentara con una dieta líquida deficiente en hierro y basada en una combinación de leche en polvo y aditivos (cuando en realidad debería alimentarse de pastizales).      El único día en que abandonarán sus celdas, será el día en que serán puestos en un camión directo al matadero.      Por último, cuando desciende la productividad lechera de la vaca, lo cual sucede aproximadamente tras 4 o 5 lactancias, y en oposición a su esperanza de vida de 20 - 25 a?os, serán enviadas al matadero luego de su dolorosa existencia, para que sus maltrechos y enfermos cuerpos se transformen en un trozo de carne para servir en el plato de algún comensal (de hecho, aproximadamente el 70% de la carne de vacuno procede de vacas lecheras), transformar sus restos (huesos, tendones, vísceras varias, etc.) en unas deliciosas vienesas o hamburguesas y, para sacarle el máximo provecho, sacarles el pellejo estando muchas aún conscientes para así elaborar cuero para vestir.      Ya en el matadero, el procedimiento es similar al de cualquier animal de engorde; es decir, serán colgadas de una sola pata con cadenas boca abajo, luego se les hará una peque?a perforación en la garganta para que se desangren lentamente.      Te preguntarás por qué se usa este método, ?simple!, cuando los animales entran a un matadero presienten lo que les va a suceder, ?cómo?, sienten el olor a putrefacción y sangre que ronda el lugar, y mientras están en fila esperando su hora, escuchan los desesperados gritos de dolor y horror que emiten sus compa?eras que en ese momento están siendo desangradas y mutiladas estando la mayoría aún concientes. Ante esto, el animal que espera en la fila apreta fuertemente sus músculos de puro miedo y terror. Obviamente, el empresario no va a entregar carnes "duras" a los consumidores, por esta razón es que cuelgan a los animales boca abajo y les hacen un peque?o orificio en la garganta para que poco a poco vayan perdiendo el conocimiento producto del desangramiento (sangre que también se aprovechara para elaborar las tradicionales "prietas" o el conocido "niachi"); de esta forma, los animales mueren con sus músculos "sueltos y blanditos" para ser degustados por algún aficionado al consumo de cadáveres.      Cada vez que compras productos lácteos y en el envase se observa el nombre de alguna marca, sea cual sea ésta, siempre, en todo Chile o en cualquier parte del mundo, ese producto procederá de los procesos industriales anteriormente descritos. Sería ingenuo que cuando compras un yogur en el kiosco de la esquina pensaras que esa leche proviene de vacas libres pastando en la pradera y felices junto a sus crías.      Probablemente, si viajas a un sector muy rural puedas encontrar algunos fundos con unas cuantas vacas que no son tratadas como en las grandes factorías. Pero, así incluso, no puedes dejar de preguntarte si es ético consumir un producto que fue hecho para otros fines. LAS VACAS PRODUCEN LECHE PARA SUS CRíAS, NO PARA LOS HUMANOS. ?Por qué tanta resistencia a comprender este principio básico de la naturaleza? ?Tan idiota y egoísta es nuestra especie? ?Acaso ya dejamos de pensar y reflexionar?... Por el momento, aún tenemos esperanzas de que podemos mejorar y cambiar nuestras actitudes cotidianas entre nosotros y con nuestro entorno. Esta en nuestras manos, no en la de los políticos.

20070219134922AA1jzZX	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Simple math question.?	Person A borrowed $25 from person B, and another $25 from person C. He bought a $45 shirt using the money he borrowed. So he still had $5 in his hand.      $25 + $25 - $45 = $5.      Using that $5, he paid $1 to person B and $1 to person C. So, he still got $3 spare money.      $5 - $1 - $1 = $3      Now, the money he still owed both person B and C is $48 rite?      B = $25 - $1 = $24   C = $25 - $1 = $24   B+C = $24 + $24 = $48      But, $48 + $3(money in his hand) = $51, and he only borrowed $50. Where did that $1 extra came from? ;)            -Ciwan-

Oxygen is dissolved in water with the total pressure of gas (Oxygen + water vapor) over the water being   2.40 atm.   The temperature is   25o C.   What is the concentration of Oxygen in the water?    Give your answer in   g/L .    The vapor pressure of water at   25.0oC   is   23.8 mm Hg.           PH2O = v.p of water = 23.8mmHg / 760mmHg *1.0atm = 0.0313atm     PO2 = PT - PH2O = 2.40atm - 0.0313atm = 2.368atm        concentration of O2     PV = nRT    PV = mass(g) / molar mass(g/mol) * RT    Density (g/L) = PM/RT                         =  (2.368atm * 32.0g/mol ) / (0.0821L.atm/mol.K*298K)                         = 3.09722g/L

There are 20 mg in each packet and I have to give half of it to him each day. It is really annoying to open a packet each day. I was thinking about putting all the medicine in a container and then take how ever much I need and put it in the water for him to take each day (which would be so much easier). The problem is, which you may already know, the measuring cups/spoons (whatever you wanna call it - example: teaspoon) all say ml. So how do I know how much to give him if I were to do it this way? 10 mg each day converted into 1 tsp or lower of ml. Plus is this an okay idea?

20090226113607AAaUDAc	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Do you feel under pressure? (gravity)?	T05.02.jpg  (275.669 Kb)   Under the force of gravity, the weight of Earth's atmospheric gases are pushing down on us all of the time so we're always under pressure.  Can you feel it?  Probably not. But some people feel changes in air pressure more than others.  Perhaps they are more sensitive to them?  Most of the evidence for this is purely anecdotal but I'm aware of a few medical studies having been done on the reported increase in delivery of premature babies when atmospheric pressure drops far below normal (e.g. in conjunction with deep low pressure storms like hurricanes, cyclones, etc.).  In a few cases, this has apparently triggered a pregnant woman's body to go into labor in an effort to equilibrate the higher pressure within her body with the substantially lower pressure outside it.      1) Describe how differences in air pressure affect you and/or your friends or relatives.      2) Since air pressure varies primarily with altitude, refer to the standard atmosphere (see Table 5.2 in your textbook or click on the link above), to "estimate" the lowest air pressure you're likely to have ever experienced. (Note: exclude airplane flights since airplane cabins are pressurized). Report this pressure (in mb) as well as where you were when you experienced it.  Do you remember noticing any physiological effects?  If so, what were they?      Handy unit conversions (in case you need them):   Feet to meters (multiply feet by .3048)   1000 meters = 1 kilometer   Miles to kilometers (multiply miles by 1.6094)

Okay, so I was given a project from my science class to make a thermos , (Since I'm in the heat & temp section). But this time, I have to use a model no bigger then a shoe box. This is what it says;      You just landed your dream job working for THERMOS, the thermos people. Your first task is to design and build a new thermos model that will keep an ice cube frozen for as long as possible. You can use any materials you like, but no liquid should leak out of your model. Your model can be no bigger then a shoe box. once you have built your model, you will present it and demonstrate it's effectiveness to the THERMOS board of directors (your classmates.)      This is what I have to do. So far, I can't use any packing peanuts cause I don't have any, but I do have Styrofoam cups, which I can use. I have a shoebox, but I need some ideas for wrapping. Something that keeps the ice cold. It will be marked on creativity, so I'll use some materials. I have some gum, so I was thinking of using bubble gum wrap.       Any ideas ? (Can't use any insulation, cause I'm not gonna grab the damn pink stuff out of my door, plus there's fiberglass, so I don't wanna be itchy.)

A random sample of 300 departures from a large airport showed an average delay of 20.3 minutes   with a standard deviation of 7.1 minutes. Using the methods discussed in class find a 95% confidence   interval for the population mean delay time at this airport.   #14. Airport delay times most definitely do not follow a normal distribution (many flights have a   delay of 0, and some have long delays.) Is this a major problem in our interpretation of the interval   found above? A) Yes B) No   #15. Suppose the interval found above was 12.2 to 24.4. Which one of the following would be the best   interpretation?   A) We can be 95% confident that the sample mean of the 400 flights is between 12.2 and 24.4.   B) In repeated sampling, 95% of the 95% confidence intervals calculated in this way would contain   the sample mean 18.3.   c) 95% of flights have delays between 12.2 and 24.4 minutes.   D) In repeated sampling 95% of the 95% confidence intervals calculated in this way would contain the   population mean delay time for departures at this airport.   E) All of the above.

20090225110256AAPmXAQ	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	How does my cat know I'm the mummy?	A lot of other cat-lovers I know say that their cats snuggle more with the lady of the house and follow them around more. My cat particularly likes to bury his nose in my hair and go to sleep! He doesn't treat my husband the same at all, but he likes to play with him more.      So how does he know that I'm female - that I'm the mummy? It's not the body shape, or the long hair, or the voice, or anything like that, because female cats are obviously completely different to female humans.       Is it pheremones or something?

20090226123608AAWQ5oi	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	RE: Orbital Space Junk?	What would be the best thing to do with orbital space junk, send it out into deep space, Nudge it into a controlled re-entry trajectory, or park it some where for recycling at a later date.      Would it be viable to put a robot tug to seek out the larger bits of junk & dead satellites in orbit, to do this kind of work?      It could probably have ion engines for main & navigational thrusters.      Be ground controlled for sensitive tasks.      If its fuel reserves were depleted it could jettison its main fuel tank into a re-entry trajectory after a full replacement tank is sent up at a later date.   Or it could periodically meet up with a separate auxiliary tank & top off when it needs to, for continued operations.      At least its something that "can" be done, instead of ignoring the problem.  The tech already exists.  At least its an option.            *By the way, which country is responsible for putting the majority of the "junk" up there in the first place?

If you know any other nice information, then shoot, I've got all day.     ALSO;     What is your favorite EXOTIC animal? (Fish don't count as exotic. List as many things as you want!!! Example; the three-eyed lizard the tuatara.)      (Of course, what's the point of having a third eye if you're BLIND with it?!?!? IDK!!!)

If a proton is released from rest in a uniform electric field, does the corresponding electric potential at the proton's changing locations increase or decrease? What about the electric potential energy?       2. If an electron is released from rest in a uniform electric field, does the corresponding electric potential at the electron's changing locations increase or decrease? What about the electric potential energy?      3. What happens to the charge on a parallel plate capacitor if the potential difference doubles?      4. You want to increase the maximum potential difference of a parallel plate capacitor. Describe how you can do this for a fixed plate capacitor.      5. If the potential difference across a capacitor is doubled, by what factor is the electrical potential energy stored in the capacitor multiplied?      6. Two parallel plates are uncharged. Does the set of plates have a capacitance? Explain.      7. If you were asked to design a small capacitor with high capacitance, what factors would be important in your design?       8. If the area of the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is doubled while the spacing between the spacing between the plates is halved, how is the capacitance affected?      9. Why is it dangerous to touch the terminals of a high-voltage capacitor even after the potential difference has been removed? What can be done to make the capacitor safe to handle?      10. Two capacitors have the same potential difference across them, but one has a large capacitance and the other has a small capacitance. You would get a greater shock from touching the leads of the one with high capacitance than you would from touching the one with low capacitance. From this information, explain what causes the sensation of shock?      11. A 12 v battery is connected to a 6.0 pF parallel plate capacitor. What is the charge on each plate?        12. A potential difference of 100 v exists across the plates of a capacitor when the charge on each plate is 400 mC. What is the capacitance?

Scatter graph: use this when there is not a exact relationship, e.g. amount of cigarettes smoked with incidence of lung cancer. there is no formula to calculate this, but there is a trend, shown of the scatter graph, if you want you can draw a trend line, but not a line of best fit. you describe this as a trend, not a relationship or proportion.       have i got this right?      also, in science, we are told never to do dot to dot lines, but i was told by my biology teacher to find out what is the name of the graph is that does this. i have seen a dot to dot line graph in chemistry before, for first ionization energy, against elements.      also, what is the technical words i should use to describe the trends on each of these graphs.
