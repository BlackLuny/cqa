20090307200720AArXjCZ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it hard keeping long time friends because their significant other doesn't like you?	Like for example, you have a good friend you've known for many years and over time they meet someone. They've been together for 2 years now. No matter how nice and friendly you try to be, you feel this negative vibe from them, or even under the breath comments that clearly means they don't like you. And so this begins to eat away at your friendship with your long time pal. Or maybe you never say anything, but the problem eats away at you from inside.      Have any of you ever been in this situation, and if so, how did you go about dealing with it? How did it make you feel?      Also, has any of your friends ever had issues with YOUR significant other? And how did you deal with that?

20090307200620AAZjU7Z	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	If us women do not protect our men and boys from the woes of feminism?	If us women do not protect our men and boys from the woes of feminism?   then who will? The way that hate, fear, supremacy, and all other forms of instilled inferiority or fought back is by those who are of the opposing group who is helping those being or trying to be oppressed. What I'm saying is this...The slaves in the USA only gained their independence because some of those of the oppressing group saw that what the oppressors were doing was wrong, and unjust in every way. So if women who see feminism for what it really is does not fight for the rights of men and boys then what message are we sending to our, husbands, sons, nephews, and male friends?      That's like me being friends with a white person(seeing as how I am black) and that white person being for and not against slavery of blacks by whites. Then that person would not truly be my friend. As I oppose the radical views of feminism and would fight for those males I love if push ever came to shove. So women where do you stand on this issue?

20090307193001AAxAqKv	Social Science;Psychology	How to stop needing approval/attention of others?	Well, I recently asked a question on here about wanting to be close with my female teachers.  I still think I would like to be their friends... like I said, I don't "attach" to everyone.  But thanks to my counselor it's come to my attention that I kind of seek the approval/attention of females b/c my mother didn't/doesn't give me this attention.      My dad is (and was) verbally abusive, and that is all my mom and I EVER talk about.  She doesn't ask how I am really, she doesn't listen to my problems at all.  I know what she's going through is a big deal, which is why I always put up with it (and why I can't tell her to think about me for once).  I mean, I know she cares for me and about me, but I think she doesn't know how to b/c her problems are so big, if that makes sense.  She doesn't know how much it hurts me or how frustrated I get b/c she's so fragile that I'm afraid to tell her anything that might hurt her.      Anyway, my counselor pointed out that perhaps I subconsciously want someone to care about me and to validify my feelings, you know?  In place of my mom sort of.  So my question to you is how could I get over this?  I really would like to not need other people's approval (in general I am kind of this way, I can't stand it if someone doesn't like me), so I guess I'll pose this as a more general question of how do I stop wanting/needing the approval of others so much?      Thanks for any help. :)

I have an idea why (fright, anxiety(biggest problem), stresses - home/family issues/ school worries)       It's almost like a tantrum, where I get really, really emotional.  If a stressful/frustrated issue has occurred as like anyone, I get annoyed and upset, but then i find away to solve it and i'd get positive and work through it via plans but then later in the days or the next day, mainly in the evenings I will get really emotional and have an outbreak - but it mainly happens if something else happens or if my mum isn't supportive to my plans...       It's just so annoying and depressing when it happens... it feels like i need to have an enormous break down nearly all the time - sometimes i have ideas of leaving or moving to a different country when no one knows me/can bother me/ frighten me. see even when typing this i get so emotional.       I don't understand - i thought i was strong and could get through anything after no one i've asked can possibly help further...

20090227095204AAWjvPL	Social Science;Psychology	Any advice or help- sorry this is long?	Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm

Ok, I was on the 7 train in new york today and two women who seemed to be around 5'10- 6feet. Anyway, they were drunk and cursing constantly and annoying the hell out of everyone on the train. Finally one guy who was around 5'6? told them to keep quiet. Instead of taking his advice they walked up to hit and started putting their hands in his face screaming and threatening him constantly. He told them to **** off after a few minutes and they began slapping him. No one else didn't anything to stop him because people thought it was funny. After a couple seconds of taking their hits the train made its stop and he swung and both of them knocking both of them to the ground and giving one of them a bloody lip. He was really just defending himself, but he was he wrong? He was trying to restrain them at first, but they kept swinging. What do you guys think?

Please read further than the first THREE paragraphs of this aritcle.    http://mensightmagazine.com/Library/sham...    This is an obvious truth about male oppression as the 5th paragraph states "There is an attitude prevalent among feminists that, because men's forms of oppression have not adequately been defined, they do not exist, or even if they do, women's oppression is far more serious and oppressive than is men's oppression. This attitude then demands that women's oppression must be solved to the exclusion of dealing with men's oppression.

If a prominent Geneticist published a book calling all women useless criminals, asking the question, "apart from breeding what is the purpose of the female ?" , what do you think the reaction would be ?      Author and predominate Geneticist at Oxford University Bryan Sykes published two books, The Seven Daughters of Eve and Adams curse. Both these books attempt to point out his view of their being inherent superiority(biologically and morally) of females over males, claims males are worthless to humanity. He associated "female oppression" to the Y chromosome(he clearly has been exposed to militant feminism), as well as male greed, violence and promiscuity. He speaks of these flaws as if they are purely male and paint a picture of females being these perfect, passive nonviolent creatures.      He speaks of men disappearing as a "glorious event" to be celebrated. In his book Adams Curse the said  "men at best are irrelevant"and society is best made up of women reproducing female only species through fusing two ova.   ______________________________________...    http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Story?id=47...     http://newsbusters.org/blogs/scott-whitl...     http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/a...     http://www.elsewhere.co.nz/culturalelsew...     http://www.oxfordancestors.com/    ______________________________________...

Why don't MRA demand his resignation like I know without a doubt the Feminists would do if he had said these things about women.      2) Is the fact he can promote this hate speech and still maintain his academic position evidence of how serious male discrimination is not taken seriously.

My stepmom (we're such good friends) and I were handgliding above the sea, and below me there was a road at the side where my crush (lets call them Ash) at the time (who always frustruated me) was runing. Ash never looked back at me. My stepmom said something I forgot, and then I said, "Lets show Ash I can have fun without them" And we soared higher into the sky, and I didn't look back at Ash again.

20090307202110AAGG9aG	Social Science;Psychology	How do YOU deal with Reoccurrent Major Depression?	I do all the regular stuff: take the lexapro,  try to get some sun daily, make myself available to friends...  But sometimes, like now, I realize that I haven't left the house,  slept too much, my friends could only drag me down, the evening has come, I've already taken a walk or two, etc. and still feel like it couldn't get worse.

20090307203618AASda1i	Social Science;Psychology	My Personality...........?	Hello. This is not a "do you think Im pretty?" or "would you go out with me?" question cause I couldnt give a damn about people who think Im pretty, ugly, whatever, I love the way I am and look and this is just a statement of the personality-ish side of me. Leave comments if you wish. What I really want to know though is: what do you think of my personality? And Im bored. :]   No picture will be put up because of the internet not being a trustworthy place so dont ask.   Music:All kindsa music. Rock, pop, country, some rap and hip-hop, dance, techno, metal, classic. Pretty much any song that I can listen to more than once. Lotsa Hollywood Undead, Metallica, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, My Chemical Romance, Evanescence, Rihanna, etc.   Video Games:I love video games. Lotsa older games like Super Mario, Galaga, Pac-Man, Twisted Metal, Dino Crisis 1 and 2. Resident Evil 4, Left for Dead, Star Fox, Arcade games and whatnot.   Movies/T.V:HORROR! horror, horror, horror. Any movie with a good and smart homicidal maniac in it. Not alot of tv but all the old-ish cartoons like.   Style-ish stuff: I am pretty shy but I will talk if your willing to get me to. I dont really have a certain...label. I am definetly not a prep, jock, emo, geek, whatever else you can think of. I mostly wear jeans, tank top-ish shirts and ALWAYS some kind of hoodie. You would rarely catch me in public without a jacket of some sort, always necklaces and earrings, sometimes bracelets and those big shoes, like skater shoes? I think thats what their called. Anyhow, I LOVE to snowboard. Its my favorite thing to do and Im heading into my 3rd year of boarding. I love to draw and take walks, ride bikes and all that fun stuff.   General-Im pretty mature for my age but sometimes I cant help but think and act like a lil kid. I talk pretty old fashioned sometimes and I am very behind in how to be "modern" And not to offend other people around my age but I dont make stupid decisions when it comes to teenager-ish things. Like drinking for one, smoking for two, and other things like stupid sex with a random *** person. (I plan on drinking at some point in my life but not now, and I never wanna smoke or do drugs) Its awful bad for you, ya know?   Hmm...I think thats it. A quick sketch of my looks would be about 5,1, 120 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes, 15 years old and wear a lil makeup.   And thats it! Thanks to all those random people that read this. You have made my day. :] And if anyone wishes to comment, no rude answers. I can take some critisism but nothin like, "you suck." And just dont write anything if you give me somethin like, "Idk, Answer mine?" Id be glad to answer things but only if you give me a reasonable reply. :] Thanks.   Again:This was outta pure bordem and I just wanted to make a statement and get it outta my system.
20090307203752AAcKmvs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I have been having this elevator dream every night..?	For a few nights now I have been having the same type of dream. I'm dreaming of being in this big nice elevator riding up and down. The first night I was on vacation with my family at a hotel.. but riding the elevator up and down.. never getting off. The second night.. I was riding the same elevator.. only I was at work this time.. still just riding up and down. This time I became weightless in the elevator and floated to the top of it while everyone around me stayed grounded. I simply explained to them that this always happens to me. Then last night I dreamed of the same elevator again.. only this time I was at a college. Still going up and down... and at one point I became weightless again. I have always had elevator dreams in my life. Even as far back as I can remember. I was around 6 when I dreamed of getting stuck in a courthouse elevator for an entire night because I didn't get off before they closed. Anyways.. I've never had them so many nights in a row though. Does anyone have any interpretations? Thank you!

20090307221844AAoaEuv	Social Science;Sociology	Why do I hate being around people?	I mean, in general. It doesn't bother me when I have to be around people, because I have no control over that (ex. church or school). But when it's an option for being around other people, even just one person, I would much rather be alone than around others.      At home, I don't watch TV if both are occupied because there are people watching with me. I like being alone in my room, with the door closed.      At school, I have lots of friends who I hang around with, and at church it's the same. But I really hate being around people in general. Am I like crazy or depressed? Because I feel like my life sucks like hell right now.      I don't get it. I mean, being around people seriously drives me nuts. Help/Advice?
20090307222153AA0vQ7o	Social Science;Psychology	What is the deal with dreams?	ok like I hear they only last like 6 seconds in real life but in my head it feels like I'm watching Lord of the Rings or something because the dreams seem that long.  And also I have the most random dreams.  Like yesterday, I had a dream that I was in my yard and these people, my age, that I have never met before were making fun of me and out of the clear blue the devil rips a hole in the air, steps out of it and proceeds to terrorize them.  This may be do to the fact that I watched the movie, Hellboy, the night before where they main character is the son of the devil but it still made me feel like a horrible person.  Aren't your dreams suppose to reflect things that have happened that day.  Please she some light on this for me.

I want a girl who cares about me, who will give me some attention, who will give me anything. But I don't care about girls anymore. I will always be sexually attracted to females but I have been ignored and rejected by them my whole life. I feel invisible no matter what I do. I would make a good contact because I'm a good decent and respectable guy, but I'm also funny and entertaining. But girls never give me a chance. I don't hate girls, but I resent them for giving me nothing. You wanna insult me or whatever, then go to hell. I just wish someone would care about me enough to pay some attention to me. Why don't girls like me? I'm a decent guy who cares about people and who has a unique sense of humor who would make a good contact. But the few contacts I do have except for 2 (they know who they are), never answer my questions. I wish I could experience some female interest/attention/interaction. Is that too much too ask? Forget you all. Dammit all to hell.   How do you deal with so much disappointment in life when the opposite sex doesn't care about you?

20090307220635AAVhZzT	Social Science;Psychology	PLEASE HELP ME WITH MY DREAM!!! I don't know what it means. Can you help?	Okay well i was dreaming that I was at a place with a little child. Now, don't laugh-but i think that it was a cupcake factory, or something. And, there was a trailer in the back of it. And a bunch of barbed wire fences surrounding the factory and trailer. Okay so anyways, there was this little girl and then all of a sudden a bunch of people were after her. And, i had to save her. We only had a little while to hide.    And for some reason, the little girl disappeared.   Since i didn't know what to do, i went to hide in the trailer. When i did, all of a sudden, a room disappeared so i was hiding in the bathroom closet and then the little girl comes running by because when the room disappeared, a door formed in the bathroom so i could see outside. But anyways, the little girl came runing by and i told her to stop! and to come hide. As i opened the door for her to get in, the same little girl came runing by. I realized that one of them  was not her. Possibly the other was a clone from the bad people. Anyways, i ended up figuring out which one was her because of the color of the hair ribbon. I took the other little girl out and threw her to the bad people angrily. then, me and the little girl took off behind the trailer. But, somehow, the bad people ended up trapping us behind the trailer. I had to throw the little girl over a humongous barbed wire fence. wheb i did it, it was like in slow motion and somehow i grew very very very tall as i dis this and threw her very lightly and she was completely unharmed. This was all i could do to save her at the time because we were trapped. yes, this is very strange, believe me, i know. Anyways, i woke up after that, but i wanted to continue my dream. So, i went back to sleep.   Then, when i went to sleep i was dreaming that i was jumping VERY high! like to the height of one and a half one-story houses. and suddenly every thing was that high that i had to jump that high. and, i was jumping away from the people with the little girl in my hands. and, as i was doing this i was jumping off of people's heads trying to hurt them because i was so mad they were trying to harm the little girl.   After that, i woke up for a second time, unable to sleep again.   Can you help me decipher my dream?   Please and Thank You!!(:

Everytime someone wants to take a picture of me I hide since I don't want to see myself or let anyone else. Does anyone else feel this way about theirself? What is due to? I also have a problem when someone compliments me on something since I honestly feel like they are just trying to be nice to me. Has anyone ever felt this way too?
20090307215350AALTAd5	Social Science;Psychology	Emotionally I feel suddenly confident and out of my comfort zone but physically?	Since going to the university's glbtau; I had a sudden burst of confidence of dealing with people. I have been keeping myself in seclusion because nothing outside of class or work really interests me. Knowing the glbtau board isn't out for blood anymore and knowing they like me (I have a platonic coffee date) I feel like I finally have defeated a barrier of my comfort zone.       But outside of my brain and emotions I feel so incredibly insecure and anxious; which I have been diagnosed with I generally have a social disease as well as LD. I feel so imbalanced and I don't know what it would take for me to actually bodily feel secure and confident in myself. I've always acted like this which causes people to call me words I can't stand: cute, timid, adorable... and I know I want to change whatever it is physically that makes people believe that for them to see me other than those words.

20090307215058AApgrFG	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The type of women who seem to get turned on by porn?	How come it seems like a lot of women who enjoy porn are bisexual?  You hardly ever hear of straight women or lesbians watching porn.  It seems like that most women who admit to watching porn are bisexual or bi-curious.       I've met a few straight women who watch straight or gay male porn and lesbians who watch lesbian and even straight porn.  But most women who watch porn seem to be bisexual.   Very few women seem to like it. Most straight women or lesbians don't like it or don't admit to it.  Why is that?  Does it not appeal to them?  I can understand that a lot of porn focuses on the woman's body a lot, so straight women won't like most of it.  But what about lesbians, don't they like it?  Do they make porn for straight women's taste?  Is it because they don't find most guys in porn attractive.

20090307210750AA3ihcm	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why the recurring dream?	I am a Christian and believe that recurrent dreams CAN mean that God has something important for us to grasp. My husband and I are separated, that's all that needs to be discussed.      My recurring dream is that I am in a bedroom. Usually an old fashioned setting bedroom. From out of nowhere, my husband enters the room. Usually never walks through a door, just appears there. He usually sits down on the side of this old fashioned bed (dark maroon and gold bedspread). He apologizes to me for things and its a happy moment. This dream occurs with usually almost always the same verbal things being expressed to me by him. Sometimes it deviates from the usual.      What could this dream mean?      Also, I have recurring dreams of cruise ships sinking or capsizing. I always get off, never knowing how. I am just shown off the ship and safe at another location.

20090307222145AAazSvO	Social Science;Psychology	So Upset - What should I do?	I know this sounds so wrong - that's why I have to vent about it over the internet, lol. I met an online friend. We've met in person alot. She's a woman as well, but I am almost 21 years younger than her. I'm 18. We've known each other for almost 3 years, but I've always felt that she wasn't honest about her sexuality even though she dates men, or at least to my knowledge. According to her Facebook, she likes both men & women. She's made suggestive comments before, and I've always thought she's liked me... but she talks about men, and will complain and rub it in my face - or so it seems. Other than that, she is a really nice person. I can't get over her. It makes it even worse because she is my best friend, and I'm always feeling depressed... I would be lost without her. I would love to tell her that I'm bisexual, but at the same time I don't want to scare her away if she doesn't know, or isn't interested. What should I do? Ugh.

To get myself to cope I sometimes set my alarm to go off, waking me up every 20 minutes that way I dont stay unconscious too long.... I eventually sleep through it and wake up in the morning. However, it eats at me all day long that I'll have this problem again that night. It ruins things....

SO I PULL IT OUT AND I GET THE OTHER SCREWDRIVER BUT WHILE I WAS DOING THIS HE WAS LAUGHING (AND THE WEIRD PART WAS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS HOOD ON ANYMORE AND IT WAS JUST HIS SKULL) SO AS HE'S LAUGHING I GET THE SCREWDRIVER AND JAM IT IN HIS SKULL AND HE GETS MAD AND I RUN BUT I NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR SOME REASON.  ITS LIKE I WANTED TO STAY AND FIGHT WHICH I DID AND WE START THROWING THOSE SAME SCREWDRIVERS UNTIL WE BOTH GET TIRED. THEN I JUST GO UP TO HIM AND TELL THAT THIS WAS GETTING NOWHERE AND HE SAID YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT. SO I CALLED A TRUCE AND HE AGREED AND AS SOON AS WE STARTED SHAKING HANDS I WOKE UP.

20090307212117AAj4nWv	Social Science;Psychology	Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder?	My psychologist believes I have obsessive compulsive dissorder in the form of fearing homosexuality. When I was about 8 my dad said that having three sisters would turn me gay and that's stuck with me.      I remember when I was young whenever my sisters said "that guy is hot" i would get anxious because I was scared I would agree with them. I've been fine for the last few years because I had a girlfriend who I was in love with. But after a messy break up and a few hook ups to move on I woke up one day and something had clicked on that was saying "**** am i gay"      From there it's become much more realistic, I started putting thoughts about guys into my head to see if I liked them and basically the more I did this the more comfortable I became with it.      I have to keep fighting these thoughts because gay is not me, before this the gayest thought i have had was 'that bloke is good looking' or 'that guy has a good body' but nothing more      I've had sexual relations with a girl, never had thoughts about guys, and have always been attracted to girls.. so what happened?      Now i look at every guy and think something gay, and I know it has become obsession.      But I don't know how to go about this because if i'm gay i can't just deny it.      Furthermore as far as the OCD goes, if thoughts about guys come into my head i often say certain things over and over such as 'you're not gay' or 'don't get aroused' and sometimes i pray as well.         What do I do?   Am I gay?

The reason for my poor performance is the fact that I began my undergrad without knowing what purpose I wanted to live my life for, and felt lost so I did poorly. After falling in love with Philosophy and majoring in it I've been earning 3.5+ in those courses each semester. That still won't convince the admissions departments of high education institutions that I'm worthy of admittance. I honestly don't want to live my life in sacrifice doing anything other than what I love. I've began to ask myself the question of whether my life will be worth living after I get rejected from every school I apply to. What enjoyment can you get out of life if your failures and mistakes remind you everyday that you will never be worthy of living your dreams? I seriously think poor performance on your academic record is like having felonies on your criminal record to the academic world.

I have trouble letting things go, I have never physically hurt anyone or myself, and I hate physically fighting over things as i believe it just makes things worse, but if i get into an argument or a verbal disagreement I stay pissed off about it for days and have trouble letting it go. I also tend to take things too personally, how can I stop these bad habits? I really don't want to see a therapist, and please don't suggest religion or going to church, those things aren't for me, I'm looking for things that I can do to self help. Thanks.

(From what I hear, it happens mostly when a man is drunk. The technical term is "whisky d*ck")   I don't blame them, though... If they tell the cops they were raped by a woman, I don't think anything would happen. They might get laughed at.      There are no support groups for this type of incident.      Do men themselves need to be more supportive to other men about this subject, and should the law be more sensitive?

20090227112600AAVxO40	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Repeated Dream:  Interpretation?	I have a repeated dream since I was about 4 years old. I am now 13 years old. The dream usually comes about twice a year. The dream is in a really bad hotel room. I was sleeping with my family in four seperate beds (because my family consists of 4 people) watching tv before we get to sleep. The room was really really dark and the walls were gray. It is just too depressing. The tv was a very old tv like the one grandparents have, and it was stabled on a box. In my dream, we were watching a murder movie or something like that. It was a really old movie (it was even in black and white). It was like it was filmed in the 60s. My whole family slept after closing the tv. But I was still awake (all that is still in the dream). So I hear a man's voice which reminded me of a person in that movie we watched before (all that was just a dream). Then a man and his helper which are the same from the movie came out from the box that was under the tv. They started laughing. I was really really scared but I didn't let them know that I wasn't asleep. Then they went to my father and cut both his hands and legs. Then they went to my mother and did the same. Then to my older brother and did the same. Then I was next, I was really scared because I was watching my family being killed (I know some people don't die when that happens, but I was four years old back then so you can't really blame me). But all of a sudden, I wake up having lots of tears in my eyes. I hope you can interpret this annoying repeating dream that I always have. Note: None of my family members are dead now or have any killing disease.
20090227115855AAX1Ewp	Social Science;Psychology	Does anyone else feel empty?	It seems like it was so long ago when I could be happy. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore and I'm almost failing school because I can't make myself care anymore. I don't like people that much either, I listen as they talk during launch, they are all assholes, they take pleasure from causing others pain. I've become so disgusted I no longer eat and just read in the library.       I am tormented with insomnia at night and apathy by day. The only joy I have is in things I have no talent in, indeed I have yet to find anything that would qualify me as anything besides sub-par. I feel incapable, I try so hard and I can't even accomplish the average.      I feel lost and I lack the passion to live life. I included the personal details to shed some light into what I think might be the cause. If anyone feels the same way, or has "solutions" feel free to post.      I recommend you don't advocate a religion or ask me to pray, if prayer worked than I'm pretty sure that there would be a lot less starving children in the world. God doesn't exist, and if he does, he doesn't care. Religion is just a way convenient way to simplify everything and it's only use is to help people cope with death.

20090307235121AApklRr	Social Science;Psychology	Someone read my life story and help me figure what to do next!?!?!?	I am 17 years old. I am so lonely. I have some friends but outside of school we don't go out like normal friends do and we barely talk on the phone. I have never had a boyfriend because boys just aren't interested in me. I am 5'4 and weigh 240. I'm not sloppy and I have a sence of fashion. I'm not ugly in the face but I feel ugly most of the time because guys don't pay me any mind and I feel like I'm left in a different world. The little bit of times I have gone out with friends, guys only try to talk to them and not me. I work 5 days a week and I end up spending all of my money to make myself feel better by buying new clothes and shoes. I can't really control my shopping habit and I need to, to save up for college. I just want to be happy but I don't know where to start. Earlier on in high school I always tried to fit in so I let my grades slip like crazy. I have an average of an 2.1 and that doesn't really look good on college apps. So there is another problem. I don't know what to do. My life sucks after only 17 years. Being lonely sucks. Friday nights with nothing to do. No one to talk on the phone with. In sschool my friends talk about boyfriends and I have no stories to tell. What to do?!?!?!

This question is for women of any age preferably 18 and up, please answer honestly.      What does it mean for a women when she says to a man that she is not interested ?      Would she say the same if the man was physically attractive ?      For my point of view as a man, if i say to a women that i am not interested is mostly because in the first place i dont find her attractive, in other words i won't say to a attractive women that i am not interested. Is this the same case for women ? Generally speaking.      Would you says to an attractive man that you are not interested ? even tough you are single ?      Therefore if the man is physically attractive to you would you "automatically" be interested ?      Could you not be interested in him even tough he is attractive and a great communicator ?      I think you understand my question by now, basically i want a general point of view from women (single or not) what you generally mean by " iam not interested" based on what mostly...looks? For men i believe its is mostly on looks.      Thank you in advance.
