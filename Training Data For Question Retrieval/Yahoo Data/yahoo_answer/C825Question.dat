20090129024626AAeq6yj	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Anyone have any kid friendly recipes with vegetables?	Usually, when I try to find "kid friendly" recipes to appease my bf's little brother, I usually end up finding something with very little nutritional value but high in taste or something that I know he won't eat. He's a visual eater. If he doesn't like the way it looks, he won't eat it and will refuse to eat it and/or throw it away. I was really upset when I spent all afternoon working on a special eggplant and zuccini parmesian and he threw it away in front of my face and his mom didn't correct him or anything so when he can get away with it, he does. He avoids anything green, or looks like a leaf, or looks like any vegetable besides corn. He also doesn't like beans. He doesn't even listen to his mom when it comes to food. I've had some success with a couple of recipes. I've made vegetable tempura and he liked it but it's deep fried so I don't want to make it that much. He also liked ratatouille but I can't always find all the fresh ingredients at a good price.       He's used to eating a lot of typical kid foods, mac'n'cheese, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, fish sticks, etc because his mom never had the opportunity to make home cooked meals. Most of his childhood food memories are of Mcdonalds and Burger King. I've already tried to add vegetables to some of his favorite foods like putting peas and carrots in his mac'n'cheese, etc but he just picks it out and throws it away.       Any suggestions would be great.

It's a rather large hole, won't that slot let the steam/heat escape that's needed for cooking?  Is there some sort of plug or cover that I missed?
