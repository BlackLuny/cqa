I'm almost done filling out my application... so I really need some good advice.      Not to be rude, but please, I only want answers from those who have been through what I'm going through. What job did you get when you went under the "open general" area and is there anyone who got stuck being a cop when you didn't want to? I know the open general area has a bad reputation of people becoming cops... but is there actually anyone whose worst nightmare came true because you decided to go open general?      Thanks in advance!

You can even google that exact quote. But before this he condemned Bush for throwing money at banks and now we don't know what they did with it. The earmarks will do the same thing with the money Obama throws at them, which will essentially be lost, we will just be out of $825 billion with the economy worse than before. Just hope that the results will be better with these earmarks because the plan contains so much pork.

20090130204831AALXB8m	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Judicial Conflict of Interest in Ohio?	I live in the small town of Marietta Ohio, I was served with protection order paperwork as I wasa picking my son up from Pre-School, I was searched right in fron of the school and the other parents as my wife told them I had guns in the truck. I am a former Police Officer as well.       I was forced out of my house as I was the stay at home father and I went to School to finish my degree. I am a Disabled Vet and I was told that i could not be around my son, wife , and the house. I have been violated twice on the TPO Once for telling her I was sorry to hear about her Uncle dying and her Coworker called the police. Another time was I was placed on supervised Visitation with my son after her intial Affidavit stated they were in fear of their lives, but the day i was served my wife kissed me goodbye and said I love you.       I have no prior police reports, calls to the house, no pictures of physical violence, no evidence supporting her cliams of kicking her and pushing her. I was in counseling for Depression and i sat down with her the nite before and told her my progress and my hopes and she decides to pull that **** the next day.      Here is the good part, I went to court for the two TPO violations and the judge compared me to these guys going around killing their wives and my Intial CPO hearing had not even taken place yet. I come to find out that the judge sitting on the bench that day is the Law Partner of my Wifes attorney in the divorce case.        I have talked to a couple lawyers and they said I have a good case but since it is small town no one around here will touch it.      I made a call today to the Ohio Supreme Court and they are sending me a grievance form.  What do you experts think?

The only thing that changed was his title on paper that made him Warden over the city inmates but the rest of the inmates were DOC which means they were state inmates. Was this legal for a Warden that is being supervised by a state probation officer to oversee 400 state inmates and have access to computers regarding state inmates and their release dates? You would not believe the horrifying stories I could tell you about that place that may in fact still go on seven years later. I hope someone will stop the abuse there. I have heard of an officer urinating over 3 inmates heads in front of a dorm of 80 inmates because they tested positive for marajuana those inmates were beaten and choked until they called this same man and two others Daddy.

20070216082221AAddZYN	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Torts & Liabilities - Scenario?	Earlier this year, WIRETAP, Inc., a relatively new company trying to compete with BUG, sent one of its employees, Steve, to BUG to get a job. BUG, not realizing Steve was an employee of WIRETAP, hired him to work in its research and development department located in Any State, U.S.A. While working at BUG, Steve forwarded any BUG e-mail he received to WIRETAP. This included e-mail between BUG officers (both domestic and abroad) that Steve intercepted using his hacking ability. At the end of each week, Steve met with his boss at WIRETAP and gave him all the information he obtained about the BUG product lines.    Walter, a security guard for BUG, learns that Steve really works for WIRETAP. Walter takes Steve to a small soundproof room where he keeps him for six hours. During this time, Walter continues to ask Steve what he is doing at BUG and what information he has given to WIRETAP. Walter tells Steve that he will hurt him if he does not tell him everything. Steve finally tells Walter what he wants to know. Walter then lets Steve go home.    a)      Has Walter committed any torts? If so, explain.    b)      Discuss any liability BUG may have for Walter’s actions.

20090130160829AAE0N2o	Politics & Government;Politics	How come lobbyists had "too much influence in Washington" but now they're "the most qualified"?	This question is referring to Obama's statement that lobbyists "won't  find a job in my White House".      I assume he said this because people agreed that lobbyists have too much influence in Washington (conflict of interest between regulating business and making money in that same business). But now those same Obama supporters are letting him flip-flop with the rationale that "we need the most qualified people" (who also happen to be lobbyists......big surprise).       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...       So are lobbyists a problem or not??      Example:      "William Lynn, deputy defense secretary nominee, was registered to lobby as recently as last year for defense contractor Raytheon, where he was a top executive. " (from article)

More often, however, they were ended by a catastrophe, such as the Great Depression, a violent social revolution, or a world war.

20070305021637AAwThM7	Politics & Government;Politics	Since I′ve noticed some people compare politics to literature on these boards...?	I have a thought.  George Bush and Jr. (Gorge and George...) are kind of like a couple characters from Of Mice and Men.  One of them is working hard and doing his job,  and the other is the poor innocent big guy with a HEART of gold (just like Jr, notice the sarcasm).  Also the big guy (Junyor) gets into a lot of trouble and George has to get him out of a jam and look for a new place as a prospect, i.e. Iraq, N. Korea, Iran, heck why not Cuba and Canada too...and finally the big dumb George has put way too much focus and attention to petting some lady and he kills her by accident...G.W. ok, nothing in common... so far.  But anyway Sr. is and was a ′real′ politician and dedicated statesman (although I didn′t agree with him or his policies) but the big dumb guy didn′t fair so well in public opinion.  So basically people, if you are smart or dumb ENOUGH, put enough dedication into something, you can make arguments for why electricity and water are equal.   ?any thoughts...?Love&Respect.

20090130173746AAPTveL	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did republicans call obama supporters stupid or uneducated?	Now before you think im some big obama supporter let me tell you who I voted for, ralph nader. Now that may make me crazier than your average liberal but I don't care.     Now on to my issue. The reason I didn't vote for obama is because he is not extreme enough for me, in my opinion he is a moderate and I want someone who leans socialist (i said leans, not is). My main issue is drugs which he does not want to legalize.     Now I didn't call bush supporters stupid back in 2000. I did in 04 because I actually had a reason. They reelected a guy who did a terrible job in his first term.     But obama supporters were just tired of bush's policys and would have voted for a napkin had it been on the democratic ticket. And how can you blame them?
20090130162339AACsoKk	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the bipartisan children's health insurance plan a good thing for America?	...Even though Bush vetoed the plan twice?      "That is why I am pleased that the Senate has joined the House in passing bipartisan legislation to provide health insurance to children whose families have been hurt most by this downturn."      Former President George Bush vetoed two similar bills in 2007, arguing at the time that the legislation would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.      The vote in the Senate was 66-32. All those voting against the bill were Republicans, but nine Republicans voted in favor."      " SCHIP covers more than 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance.   advertisement      The bill's supporters say it would extend the program to an estimated 4 million additional children, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes."       http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/30/o...

[FACT] did you know that the sceintist did not know if the nuclear chain reaction would stop, or just keep going. if the chain reaction would not have stoped the fire ball would have consumed the entire planet! in other words, they rolled the dice, and to took a chance with the entire planet at risk!....why?      when japan attacked pearl harbor,they took the lives of less than 3000 people. when america dropped the A bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki, they took the lives of over 100,000 people. some people would call that mass murder and i agree. how do they justify 3000 to over 100,000. they cant, they just wanted to play with there new toy. even if it ment opening pandoras box.      J.Robert Oppenhiemer, the father of the atomic bomb, knew, that a grave error had been made. he  pleaded with government to end all nuclear development, they ignored his pleads, and labeled him a radical.       the fact that it ended the 2 world war, does not change the FACT that the american government cares not for what is right or wrong or good or evil. all they care about is absolute power and control. even if it means selling there souls to the prince of darkness.

Meeting with Republicans about his "bail out" package, agreeing to compromise and remove things they didn't agree with and added things they wanted him to, when they voted 100% thumbs down? I find it very interesting that they had no problem voting for the money Bush wanted over and over again which did nothing but feed the rich and still left out main street. Yet Obama's plan has something for everyone, including fixing America's infrastructure, ie: bridges, highways and everything else that makes life convenient for Americans.       If they were sending a message, they now know their message went nowhere, except to the American people, that in spite of losing the election and seeing their party crumbling, that they have no intention of changing, or are interested in bipartisanship.      Why can't they understand that continuing to behave this way is going to make things even worse for their party and if they continue to shrug off the President Americans voted for they will cease to be a political party in this country.      Obama has done everything to include them in his cabinet, decision making and has reached across party lines, just like he said he would and the Republicans continue to act like they are an exclusive, elite club.      The truth is the Democrats no longer need them to pass anything, yet Obama still wanted their participation. Maybe when they lose again in 2012, it might sink in, although I really doubt it.       If this country goes into another great depression, which is the way it's looking, Americans aren't going to blame the Democrats. They learned the hard way after 8 years of Bush's lies, manipulation and corruption. They'll blame the Republicans now that they know what the Republican leadership is. Stuck up, stuck in the 20th. century and stuck in their way of thinking.

Steele: 'How do you like me now?'   By ALEXANDER BURNS    Michael Steele emerged victorious in the election for chairman of the Republican National Committee Friday, and proclaimed a fresh start for a party that faces a long road back to political power.   “This is the dawn of a new party,” Steele said at a press conference following his victory. “There is not one inch of ground we’re going to cede to anybody.”   Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor, is the first African American to win the office of RNC chairman.         Well, fancy that.............   A black person 'elected' in a senior position in the GOP? ('Elected', not appointed, like Powell or Rice)      Isn't it soooooo obvious that Steele is the GOP's 'answer' to Barack Obama?    Tame, and in his place, saying exactly what is expected of him. (In spite of all his 'fighting talk', Steele will be out on his butt if he dares to oppose the old WASPs. Believe it.)      Has Obama really rattled the GOP's cage, or what?

Most of my conservatives friends despise liberal, democrats for all the cliched reasons you libs say we do. Fine. But.. 90% of my conservatives friends... still hold their noses voting for republicans too, cause they see them as still largely politicians with suspect motives and means and behavior. BUT you libs.. seem to thikn your party is like the party of hope and change. YET illinois is darn good proof of what my conservative friends feel. Why can't you liberals just be honest and admit that YOUR guys are betraying your ideals as well. and we have a huge middle ground we could agree on and kick half of them out?   We all agree there should be no pay to pay!   Maybe we can agree they should read the bills before signing, not just have staff read. (anyone here sign anything of consequence without reading it?)   Can we kind of agree that we would like more power at the local level to do things and more money should stay local rather than go to DC get sucked dry and dribbled back?   Can we try to agree that parents and teachers locally should have more say about their children's education than someone like George Bush (or Obama... pick your poison).   Can we agree that taxes are kinda getting out of hand?   Can we agree we should not have welfare for corporations? (i know its too much to ask you libs to agree on letting state and local governments deal with welfare too the poor.. but i will be bi-partisan. no pork for business)      Where are the reasonable liberals?

As a liberal I bet you expect me to say yes, but im going to shock you, no it doesn't! For example, the reason the kids at Columbine murdered so many people was not because they had guns lying around, but because they were bullied and no one listened to them. Believe me, back in high school I wanted to kill a few people myself.       And in my neighborhood, you better have a gun or you will be killed. And none of these people have licenses. I keep at least 20 guns in my house including an ak-47 for that very reason. If people know you have guns, they will leave you alone. I promise you!

I am 1 of 3 coaches for a cheer team preparing to go out of state for a Nationals Competition next week. I have for years ran a raffle ticket fundraiser (had tickets printed, gave them out, collect the money, pay for the team party, and was the only coach to stand at stores to help the girls sell them) I found out last month 1 of the coaches sent an email to only the cheerleaders adding a practice and instructing them to bring her their ticket money. We were never informed of the practice but later saw the email. After that, I told her since I am a bonded coach and running the sale I needed to be the only one collecting the money via a email. She continued to collect money and never handed it over. when I needed it to pay for the party I reminded her several times to bring it to me Yesterday. I knew she gets paid on Friday and I wanted to see if she could produce it the day before. 1st she said she had to cash 1 of the checks that she had a parent write to her and she would deliver it to me on her way to work Friday. Then she said it's at her other office and I can get it Friday evening. No word from her yet. I don't want to stress the girls with an uproar right now. What should I do?

He last saw his father when he was 3 and that was only for a few hours.  Since then there have been no phone calls, no letters, no birthday cards etc. Absolutely nothing. After almost 10 years going in circles with my county case worker, I went to a lawyer and I was receiving support one month later.  I stopped getting support 6 months ago. Once again, the county seems to always be outsmarted by him.  He is still court ordered to pay $365 every two weeks, so his back support is rapidly increasing. What are my options?  Can I sue him for back support?  If so, how? He is in Maryland and I am in Wisconsin.

20090130191347AAniePX	Politics & Government;Government	Is Obama really on our side? ?	Did you hear about The Chief Military Judge James Pohl's denial to delay the trial of the Guantanamo detainee, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of planning the 2000 attack on the USS Cole which killed 17 of our US service members and injured 50 others?  Obama wants legal proceedings to be halted for 120 days so that a review can be conducted.  To do this, the Pentagon will be forced to temporarily withdraw charges against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and probably 20 other detainees facing trial at Guantanamo Bay, including the mastermind behind 9/11--Khalid Sheik Mohammed.  Anyway, I am so proud of Judge Pohl for denying Obama's order.  Judge Pohl states that he "...found the government's arguments "unpersuasive" and that the case will go ahead because the public interest in a speedy trial will be harmed by the delay in the arraignment."  Hussein Obama's administration thinks the "interests of justice" is going to be served by the delay.   This, Obama thinks, will allow the government to review the 245 prisoners at Club Gitmo so he can figure out which ones should be prosecuted and  which ones should be released.  RELEASED??  I am so glad that there is someone with a backbone who is not afraid to stand up to this administration.  Who's side is this administration on?  The side of the American's?  I am not quite sure.

While he was driving, he passed a cop who pulled out behind him. The cop was a good distance behind us..so he didn't pay that much attention to him. (We were only going about 5 over, and it was on the interstate, we slowed down to the speed limit). Anyways, a few seconds after the cop pulled behind us, one of those construction trucks with those blinking arrows pulled in front of us. Except the arrow wasn't blinking. Four dots in the corners of the sign where. For a few miles, the trucks was pacing us, we switched lanes once and he immediately switched and stayed in front of us. There were no other cars on the road (They all passed us)...apparently the cop turned his lights on for a few seconds while he pulled out, but he was to far behind us and when my boyfriend finally noticed it, the lights went off and the truck pulled in front of us. Did the truck have anything to do with the cop? Could the cop have taken a picture of our license plate and sent a ticket or anything like that? And my final question is...what do the four flashing lights mean?

So I kept driving. When I got to the toll way leaving the interstate, the light flashed that I was low on the account. (It didn't flash red..just said it was low). I was confused so I called the account again and it still said 53 bucks. So something went wrong. Will I still be sent a violation? I tried calling everyone, EZ pass people, I pass people, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike people and no one was able to tell me or give me a straight answer. Anyone have anything to help me?

And forget about that little comment Obama made about not allowing any lobbyists in his administration. Yeah,that was all crap. Forget about the change. Forget about him fixing the economy. Instead he's going to be more corrupt than ever before, allow terrorists more rights, and make sure all teen girls can have free abortions. This man makes me more and more sick by the day.

20090130194504AAbzu4n	Politics & Government;Politics	Question for those on the right: Are you conservative first or American first?	Limbaugh stated that he hopes that Obama's stimulus plan fails b/c it's not a conservative plan. How is this not hoping that the President of the United States fails in his plan to help the country.      Being critical of the plan is one thing, but to hope that the plan is unsuccessful is to hope that America does not prosper unless success comes the way he says it should.      If you agree with Limbaugh, are you an American or a conservative first?      hypothetically:   If Obama's plan solved the credit crunch, got real estate values to increase, decreased unemployment and helped the economy to start growing again, that would be a good thing.  Why would you HOPE that none of this comes to fruition.  Is it because of Obama's political ideology?  Can you really argue against success?  Are you that partisan?
20090130200328AAEDcYF	Politics & Government;Politics	If conservatism is right, than why...?	Do they constantly seem to play the victim card in claiming that the media is out to portray them as something they are not?  Whether the media is out to get you or not, the argument that the so called "liberal media" hates conservatives is too convenient for those on the right.      Every time an outlet like MSNBC reports something bad about the Iraq war, conservatives claimed that the media only looked for the bad things to show on television in order to make Bush look bad, but when MSNBC reported that violence was dropping, suddenly conservatives were glad to quote the media's reports as evidence that Bush was right all along for staying the course.      This is called cherry picking evidence in order to build a false argument.  Why must they do this if they are on the right side of history?      Also, why must they listen to the events of the world through the prism of the new conservative media.  How could a man behind a microphone in Florida or New York know more about what's going on in Iraq than an imbedded reporter?

Is th?	you know, I would not be the least bit suprised if the GOP wanted to lose the election on PURPOSE just in hopes that there would be earmarks, pork, lobbyist in Obama's plan, americans would in turn be against it, and they could as they are now doing play politics to contribute to Obama's bad image. Because I heard NOTHING of the supposed GOP stimulus plan until now that  Obama has a plan which is unpopular. Is there any way this could result in the GOP being met with legal charges if it is found to be true?

They took her to the hospital and the MRIs showed that she has a blood clot in her brain now (which is dangerous) and now they're just waiting to see if they have to do a surgery.    The workplace just let the guy leave ! I am really worried and I need to know what legal actions we can take . Can we sue the workplace ? What are the appropriate steps ?   Any help will be appreciated.    1- The workplace is a huge department store so it won't go out of business.  2- We're in Canada so the government pays for the hospital, etc.  3- The blood clot is definitely from the head injury (and nothing that she could have had before)  IT is NOT about the money it's about the disability ! it's not just a cut on the hands ,it's brain damage !
