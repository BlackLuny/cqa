GbxyzEYRaa	I would suggest buying the psp. But you should buy the Ratchet and Clank package because it has a better screen than the other psps and it also has a built-in microphone for internet calling (it's free to call other psps but you need to buy a plan to call cell phones and landlines). Plus the psp can do everything the ipod touch can do and better. Like better graphics and better varieties for games.|`|lvL1mm8taa	Well they are both pretty much the same. The more expensive one is smaller and I think it has a little better screen. It probably just depends whether you like it big or small. (no pun intended)  As for the touch, it's a good music player but the games you can get on it get pretty boring after a few plays. The PSP is also a good music player. If you want games i'd go with the PSP.|`|AlfMfL9Xaa	I agree with Jordan H., the new Nintendo DSi is way better then the psp. It does release in March. It's pretty cool too. I'm even going to buy one myself :). Hope I help.|`|g8pUS4dqaa	They're both about the same.  I'd say go with the old one just because it's cheaper, and the new one feels like a McDonalds toy in your hands.|`|e0hHagmUaa	okay buy a nintendo dsi realeases in march <br>  double touch screen<br>  a high quality camera <br>  sd slot<br>  free internet browser already installed<br>  download free ds games if you have R4 (revolution for nds)|`|LkOW2I6Jaa	first off u should get a psp cuz it is worth your cash.the itouch is just music and videos.and games are trash.the psp is built for games.anyway i suggest u go with any psp.they both are awesome.the new one ($200) is less heavy and it has different functions.this page can help u better<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation...</a>|`|tWp9SOvwaa	dont listen to that guy below me sayin they are tha same.....cuz hes a damn liar. i own all 3 models of psp, and tha new one (3000 series) has a built in microphone, brighter colors, you can play psp games on a regular tv set with a cable you can buy, too. tha original psp is out-dated, and tha new ones are faster n have more RAM. the new 300 series has 2 bundles, one is black and one is i think silver. both come with a memory stick, 2 games and a movie....its a great deal.

On the top right hand corner of the page there is a bit that says Username: (your username) NP: (Your NP) NC: (You’re NeoCash) Click on the amount of NP you have, then you will be taken to you’re inventory, then click on the food item, and on the scroll down list choose Feed to (Your pets name).<br>  <br>  2. Click along the top where it says My account, explore, boards, games, shops, news etc. then, then click on shops. There will then be a list in the middle of the page at the top. Click on inventory then click on the food item, and on the scroll down list choose Feed to (Your pets name).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Cvu5VkCgaa	You go to your gallery or safe and double click on the food.

KIjjg3DJaa	It's probably because one of the items you downloaded has a bug in it. There really is no way to tell which item it was. My suggestion is, if you have only added a few things recently, try deleting those things and see if it works. Otherwise, you will have to remove all of the custom content and slowly re add it until you have a problem. Then the one that gave you a problem is the one that is bugged. It really sucks if you download a whole bunch of custom content at once because then you have no idea where to start. This has happened to me more than once.<br>  <br>  In the future, try only downloading 20 or so custom content items at a time, that way if there is a problem, you can easily narrow it down.<br>  <br>  Oh, and The Sims 3 is coming out this weekend! So you could just go buy that! LOL

Most of the terrorists will want to run through there.<br>  <br>  Second place to plant is to the right of the fence where there is another opening.<br>  <br>  Then plant the rest on the incline next to the ferris wheel, as some terrorists will want to flank you from there.<br>  <br>  You'll obviously need to pick off all terrorist as quick as you can, and also try to take out any terrorists from the helicopters before they have a chance to go down the rope.<br>  <br>  Once the Coalition chopper arrives, take out anybody next to the ferris wheel then pick up the wounded. Carry him around the ferris wheel and try to get behind the chopper as cover, and leg it towards the back end of the chopper and you're home free.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
QkFnEIWSaa	Put your Metapod at the top of the heap so he goes out first. Then trade him out for some other Pokemon. You can do the same thing for Magicarp.

ysiE6IDjaa	When your active Sim is in the shower or on the rug, click on the Sim he or she would like to woohoo with. The option that comes up in the pie menu is something along the lines of 'Join me in the shower' . I forget the exact wording for the rug, but it's something very similar. If you still can't get them to work it may be something in the settings eg you may have the settings set to 'in love' and you are trying to woohoo with a Sim you are only acquaintances with.

84cab3e19692da71ddb2837fa88afa2baa	Well, I'll try to break it down for you if you haven't purchased it yet.  I purchased it the second it came out, and I'm still not 100% sure it was worth the $5.  Here's what you get. <br>  <br>  4-5 Video Challenges<br>  You get about four or five new video challenges with the download.  Seems like it'll be fun, and don't get me wrong, it is, but I finished all of them, in one minute, on the first try, except for one I had to retry a few times to get just right.  So, in total, took me about ten or fifteen minutes I think.<br>  <br>  1 Skating Challenge<br>  You get one challenge at Rob's Factory called Skate Jam or something.  Pretty much you and three other Pro's inside the Fantasy Factory for the first round, and on the roof of Rob's Factory hashing it out for points in the second round.  Very quick, and very easy if you have the flickit system down.  Get a 3x multiplier and do some laser flips to grind to 360 hardflips, or something similar, and you'll beat it no problem.<br>  <br>  5-6 Own-The-Spot Challenges<br>  There were a few more Own-The-Spot Challenges as well, however, not very long at all.  I owned all of them in seconds...I mean, literally on my first try, I owned them all.  Killing the spots took a few try's but was still only about one or two minutes for each one.  In total I think this took about ten minutes maybe.<br>  <br>  8-9 Freeskate Activities<br>  After I was done with the offline stuff I went online to try it out.  There were a few new Freeskate Activities, most of which were ridiculously easy, however, the process of getting them all is lengthened due to the fact everyone in the party has to complete it.  If you have good players in your party these would probably take you no longer than fifteen minutes, but if you're unlucky like me you'll keep getting people that aren't very good.  I eventually got them all, probably in thirty minutes or so.  <br>  <br>  4 Achievements (25G each, 100G total)<br>  You get four new achievements to try your luck at.  One is beating all the film challenges, and one is beating the Jam at Rob's Fantasy Factory, those two are easy enough.  The other two are Secret Achievements so I'll post them at the end just in case you don't want to see them.<br>  <br>  So, all in all, it's not a very hefty package.  I believe you get a total of one hour play time maybe, and of course whenever you play the level online, or in freeskate, etc.  There's also barrier's blocking a couple road's with building's in the distance, and I believe that the next DLC pack that's coming out, supposedly next week, is going to remove these barrier's and allow you access to the school, and community center, etc. so you can do the film challenges/jams there.  So, that being said, you might need to download this first, though I'm not positive.  I'd assume if you don't it just will keep the barrier's there and you'll have to teleport back and fourth to the places instead of skating down the street to each of them.  Then again I could be totally wrong about that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, final opinion, if I would have known what I was getting before I purchased it, I probably would have purchased it again.  It's a pretty big place and I feel there's a lot of replayability.  I've already been back to the FF a couple of time's to make video's and move some table's, rail's and ramp's around to make some Spots.  I find a lot of fun in it.  The only way I wouldn't see this as worth it is if the next three locations don't come out in one pack for 400MSP or less.  If I have to pay $5 for each of the new locations (three of them) for a total of $15, and $20 if you include the FF, then I'd think it was a ripoff.  But as long as the next three locations bring the total cost to $10 or less I'll be quite happy with my purchase.<br>  <br>  <br>  SECRET ACHIEVEMENTS (SPOILERS)<br>  <br>  Secret Achievement 1<br>  So the first one is pretty easy, just go to the top of Rob's Fantasy Factory and look for some green rails that form a square.  What they are forming a square around is a skylight on the roof.  Simply jump in and you'll get the achievement.  <br>  <br>  Secret Achievement 2<br>  This one's a little trickier.  If you go to the water spillway behind Rob's Fantasy Factory you'll see a pipe sitting on the side.  Should be a half pipe, full pipe, and half pipe.  What you need to do is touch the top of the full pipe.  There are multiple ways to do this.  You can either try your luck at getting enough speed to do a loop inside the pipe...really hard, but you only need to make it about 3/5's of the way as it'll give you the achievement once you hit the top of the pipe.  The other way is to use the bounce glitch to land on top of the pipe, and then walk over to the middle and it'll give you the achievement that way as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  SPOILER END<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So yeah, that's what you get, and for me, at the moment, it's definitely worth the $5.  We'll see what they do with the next three locations though.  If it's all of them for 400MSP I'm good, but if they are 400MSP each (1200MSP total) I'll be very unhappy.

JWjq5iaXaa	That's a tough one... A lot of people play M games when they're young, 14 is a good age, so unless you're strongly against violence, then yea, it's ok. Besides, GTA isn't much worse than everything else in pop culture nowadays.|`|jxpV13rTaa	its usually ok for a 14 year old to play. its very common. the gameplay for gta 3 isnt too graphic and the language is there, but not a problem..drug reference, violence and language are the reasons it is rated 17+ though. but 3 years isnt that big of a difference right?|`|5a4dVSvIaa	I would probably let a 14 year old play it, but it all comes down to what you think is too violent or too graphic. I would play the game for myself first, or at least watch some gameplay videos on youtube.|`|TfcQc0fmaa	Yes as long as they know its just a game and won't do anything that happens in the game, like jack a real car if they are known for misbehaving or not mature at all then don't let them play it.|`|qkLqlW4Caa	what is gta?|`|E8gMdvoaaa	dude a 6 year old plays it|`|BttUGexOaa	i played GTA San Andreas when i was 11-12 and i never thought about drugs killing people or jacking cars... if i went through it at age 11 then obviously he can do it... GTA games are fun... but they do have bad language... you just gotta learn to ignore it... just a fun game.... besides GTA 3 is old as hell... get ur child or yourself GTA 4|`|z6mpvCn7aa	NO!

Io6QLClcaa	WAR CRAFT 3 u will not be disappointed with DOTA the replay value is eternal online u go to custom games and that's where ur money is go to getdota.com to download the maps so u can play.  Save it in program files/war craft/maps/downloads. Fallout 3 is short and just aggravating.<br>  So just get the battle chest wich has wc3 and the ft and to manuals.  Battle.net is gold baby gold.|`|fXYNNmgOaa	If you want a shooter get Fallout 3. If you want a good RTS then get Warcraft III battle chest. I like warcraft II for its custom games on Battle.net.

Thanks|`|0DrKZvJaaa	I think fallout 3 because it is way more longer than warcraft 3 and without the frozen throne expansion for warcraft 3 there is next to no one on the original warcraft 3 battle.net for multiplayer.|`|JvQ2Reb9aa	Fallout 3 is a good game|`|VCA9iGtaaa	wc3 for sure.  like grizzly said, the replay value is the best in any game i've ever seen.  if you prefer customs like he does, you'll be able to play whenever and you'll enjoy it.  same goes if you enjoy battlenet matches like I do.  there's still a lot of people that play it.  it's a good mix between fast paced and strategy based.|`|r60WMB6paa	fallout 3 fo sho|`|Tr2WTkRjaa	fallout 3 wow is boring and  creeps play all day!!

5vM3jshLaa	Do you really want to know how to but a video game?|`|uoIV59V6aa	ok look, go to gamestop get a 1600 microsoft point and get home turn ur 360 on got to marketplace find gta4 lost and damned and download it.(REMEBER TO REDEEM THE CODE FIRST)|`|u18GBKmiaa	you have to have an xbox live account there is a gold membership on xbox live which you have to pay for and you also have to buy microsoft points which will enable you to purchase gta <br>  the points can be purchased online|`|VPYZWre4aa	You have to have the original hard copy, the new thing is just a add on. You have to have a Xbox live account in-order to use microsoft points. You can buy them via credit card over the Marketplace, or you can go to a electronics store and buy the points. You can even buy the update itself and just type in the 25-digit code when you get home.|`|t4u4XERBaa	you can make a free gold membership account that lasts 1 month and if you want you can renew it but you don't have to. then you ether can go to the store and buy a Microsoft points card (will be sold anywhere xbox games are soled) or you can ask your parent(s) if you can use their credit card and you can pay them back you will need 1600 Microsoft Points( it will be like 15-20$).<br>  then once you have a gold membership and 1600 Microsoft Points you go to the xbox live market place and download it!
tmckNa4baa	Yup its very boring lately! T_T my friend says its because they r bringing bak the old items and i think cp used to be owned by disney but someone else bought it now and its sooooo boring!|`|mD7zO8bqaa	ITS BORING MY OLDER SISTER SAID MYSPACE IS BETTER IM IN 4TH GRADE|`|Ye0qbdCgaa	YES because there is nothing to do get a facebook soooo much better and its free ;-)|`|uip9Rpkcaa	O ya! nothing ever happens well unless you think buying a dumb pet and putting dumb clothe on a penguin is fun|`|lot0fR44aa	yes but thats just because after a certain amount of time even the best of online games dry up and get boring|`|k6g5wRoQaa	yes|`|te2aIm0Maa	Club penguin sucks my dad's nuts. 30 dollars every 6 months to see a bunch of gay penguins on steroids dancing and waving with little balls of hair that cost 800 "coins" called puffles. HAHA what a joke.|`|yAqEFMh3aa	True that.
Med7VQI7aa	Fallout 3<br>  <br>  Pros: 50+ hours of gameplay, HUGE world, Awsome shooting mechanics (VATS system), many side quests.<br>  <br>  Cons: Short main storyline (don't beat it if you buy it!), a few bugs but all the pros make up for it. <br>  <br>  GTA IV<br>  <br>  Pros: Again 50+ hours of gameplay, Detailed New York (smaller than San Andreas though), Great Storyline, it's just fun to screw around.<br>  <br>  Cons: No real good side quests, game gets old after you beat the main storyline.<br>  <br>  In my opinion I think you should buy Fallout 3. I've played both and Fallout 3 seems like you could play it forever. Just don't beat the main storyline to it. GTA IV is a great game also, but once you find out all the limits of the game, it gets boring. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :D :D :D|`|YjpCbc9daa	Ok, I have a PS3 and I have finished both GTA IV and Fallout 3. Both are great games in my opinion, but I think GTA IV will be a better choice for you.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Well since you're a new PS3 owner, you'd want to try out multiplayer. Fallout 3 has no multiplayer - only single player - whereas in GTA IV, you can go online and kill other players. This increases the fun factor, as it is always fun to murder other players as opposed to murdering the AI.<br>  <br>  Also, GTA IV's storytelling is way more dramatic than Fallout 3's, and I think that you would love to be immersed into a dramatic storyline for your first PS3 game. This gets you in the mood of gaming more and more and more.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, once you finish Fallout 3, there will be nothing more to do. Since you can't go online, the game disc will eventually be left to collect dust on your shelf. When you finish GTA IV, it will also get boring for you, but you can go online and continue your random, violent killing rampages.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, Fallout 3 is also a great game, as it is unique to other games in terms of being able to decide on your actions for yourself (whether to nuke a town or to save its residents, etc.) and you can choose to be evil or good.<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to buy both - if not- then just buy GTA IV. Nothing beats dramatic storylines and online gameplay.|`|BttUGexOaa	ok leme tell you something... i played gta loved it... bought fall out 3... got bored under and hour... horriblee! makes your head hurt.. you wotn know what to do... freaking you are in some place and it looks like the remains of a nuclear explosion... fallout 3 is gross.. .get gta 4|`|OKmHtDWBaa	I'd go with Fallout 3. The GTA series has always been kind of boring to me. Fallout 3 is really fun from what I've played so far.|`|C4MWGEiLaa	I think you should get Grand Theft Auto IV because I have it and its the best game ever and the only reason I bought it was because it was rated 10|`|r60WMB6paa	GTA mannnn bestt gammerrrrrrrrrrrriismmmm|`|j0vE91afaa	no you should buy other games like Resistance 2.<br>  cause Fallout 3 and GTA IV is better on the Xbox 360

j0vE91afaa	Nothings wrong? Dont worry every console does that and wont brake you game.....hopefully|`|Cvu5VkCgaa	Go to hollywood video and visit game crazy. they will run it through a machine that takes the srtched off and makes it run clean. Good luck!
2GNFQPdmaa	That happened to Oblivion for me. I took it to a game store that repairs scratches, and they buffed it for me, but they said I would be lucky if it still worked, because that happens all the time and it usually ruins the disc.<br>  <br>  I was lucky. You might be out of luck.|`|qSQ9dxOPaa	go get it buffed....if that dont help...try instaing to your HD<br>  <br>  and f that dont help you need a new game
10e620a87fddffd3c600a41c5cc09ab4aa	I did play it and to be honest...in my opinion IT WAS AMAZING.<br>  sure it may not be like previous halo games but it was amazing all the same. <br>  if you have ever played command and conquer and enjoyed it YOU will love halo wars. <br>  if you own an xbox 360 i definitely suggest getting the demo <br>  ALTHOUGH if you do not have an xbox 360 definitely buy one best investment if your a gamer<br>  if you are planning on getting it, some good games are<br>  -HALO WARS (duh!)<br>  -left 4 dead<br>  -halo 3<br>  -COD 4and 5<br>  -rockband (1 or 2)<br>  <br>  OH and dont listen to tony G|`|vAUewI5faa	to the guy who said that they are confused about the flood...<br>  THERE IS NO FLOOD IN THIS GAME!!!! Ensemble took it out cause it didnt fit in the story line. <br>  ya i like the demo a lot, but i think they should have added online multiplayer cause i got bored of it already.|`|0kT9vgGxaa	i didnt play it but i saw the video preview and it was bloody awesome!<br>  im so going to get it as i love the halo series so yeah!|`|k7TLCP5Naa	I thought it was good for a console RPG, i loved age of empires and mythology so Ensemble know what they're doing. Though I'm confused about the flood. If you play as them, how do u get resources, also. If you  encounter them in the game as the UNSC, it would be irrelevant to the Halo story-line, seeing as the UNCS first encounter them 28 years after halo wars.|`|5WjdFqMXaa	its gay. its like starcraft halo version... halos gay now anywaya too many halo nerds.<br>  <br>  halo3 is lik a fossil of a game now.<br>  <br>  call of duty way better thsn halo franchise
582008a644967fc7225323ac9985c713aa	Did you check the website?
YU1fnbrbaa	Nope, you  can do it on easiest and still get them.<br>  <br>  But of course you still need to complete the requirements<br>  <br>  (Before I get on to how to unlock the two, I should mention that you need to unlock CAMMY, ROSE, FEI LONG, GEN, DAN, and SAKURA before getting Akuma, and you need to unlock Akuma to get Gouken.)<br>  <br>  For Akuma, you must have at least 2 perfect rounds before facing Seth, and you CANNOT lose/use any continues. After Seth, if completed the requirements properly, you should be taken to another stage and be facing Akuma. You must win to unlock him.<br>  <br>  For Gouken, you must defeat arcade mode with Akuma (no requirements with Akuma, just defeat it) THEN you can use any other character to defeat arcade mode, but again, you need to complete these requirements :<br>  -(Mentioned above, defeat arcade mode with Akuma)<br>  -Have at least 2 perfect rounds before Seth<br>  -Perform at least 3 Ultra Combo FINISHERS (Yes, you must win 3 stages by defeating your opponent with an Ultra.)<br>  -Do not lose/use any continues<br>  -Gouken, like Akuma, appears after Seth if completed the above properly.

dDR4RGrbaa	Practice makes perfect, my friend.|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Practice, practice, practice...<br>  <br>  Play games at the hardest level (single player) until you're reasonably good, then play on-line.<br>  <br>  Also, develop your style. If you're no good charging into the middle of combat, then don't. If you're best as a long-range sniper, do it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dLxi6AQCaa	Getting good at a FPS takes a lot of practice.  The more you play the better your reflexes, reaction time, aim, and the little things that make you better like hearing sounds and knowing exactly where theyre coming from.  Back when I was in junior high, with a lot of time on my hand, a group a friends and I would play counter-strike every day for at least 4 hours for years.  We got so good that we could reload every other round and just have enough in 1 clip to go through 2 rounds because 95% of our shots were headshots.|`|yGWmK9N6aa	Its all about practice. Get a few of your friends and just practice. For example:Halo 3- Get your friends and play some MLG, or other  customs. MLG helps improve your BR, which is your best friend. Come up with tactics, and positions for each player. Then go into a matchmaking game and put those plans to play. Then see where you are lacking and practice there. Although Killzone is another story, practice. . .|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Practice.<br>  <br>  Play with the sensitivity levels different than what you normally do to put a little extra adaptiveness into your game. Put it on Hard...or crazy hard...or legendary...or master ninja...whatever. Go to a gaming website that would have maps, and start studying. Once you get the game go  into multiplayer areas and get the feel for them, find powerups, hiding points, sniping points, respawn points. <br>  <br>  And the ultra secret code...practice...|`|HT41fZJJaa	easy really<br>  but it depends on your life<br>  rent some games like Call of Duty or Star wars Battlefront and practice on those<br>  but don't go online as soon as you can<br>  (if there is an online function)<br>  or campain do a few free plays

tHFY2hg4aa	right click on the icon that launches the game and go to the compatibility tab. Turn on "Run as Administrator"<br>  This problem is common with Windows Vista, but could still happen in XP.|`|9iSKgRF8aa	take the disc out then simply yell at it for a while that usually works.
ATvI1WmKaa	Well Custom Robo Arena is personally my very favorite game on the DS.  Its basically two bite sized mechs duking it out in virtual arenas.  You can fully customize your guy with hundreds of parts, than take your configuration into the arena either locally or online to shoot up your friends.  Hectic on the level of Super Smash Bros, but there's strategy involved both in and out of the arena, as you're choosing just the right parts to give yourself the edge.<br>  <br>  If you liked Zelda: Phantom Hourglass (I did too btw), you might also like Super Mario 64 DS and Animal Crossing: Wild World.  Both, ESPECIALLY Animal Crossing (which can take years to fully complete, due to its real time system) have great replay value, and are just fun games to pass the time.<br>  <br>  Animal Crossing is a little like the Sims.  You've just moved to a new town.  The local shopkeeper loans you a house, and from then on you're set loose to basically do as you please.  Its a really casual game, but there's a lot to do.<br>  <br>  Super Mario 64 is a remake of the original Nintendo 64 game.  If you've played either that, Galaxy, or Sunshine, this doesn't stray too far from the formula.|`|4SGESmJGaa	Proffesor Layton - its a lil expensive but it is very good and it has a very well thought out bunch of missions<br>  <br>  Fifa 09 - dont think ude like that but if u are into football that is a great game if not dont bother lol<br>  <br>  Animal crossing - although i haven't played this game i have heard it is pretty good<br>  <br>  Mario Kart - i think this is a classic tbh i have it on wii and DS <br>  <br>  Im very sorry if none of these are any good to u but i tried my best :}|`|89cf9ddb5b944824a750b09ceeffa21caa	i personly love animal crossing wild world because you can do just about anything|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Prof. Layton, Mario Kart DS, & Mario 64 DS are all great games. You might like Drawn to Life or Locke's Quest- they're adventure games, but DtL you draw your own elements, weapons, ships etc.  L'sQ- you build defenses around a certain place and then fight monsters to defend your town.<br>  <br>  I got Geometry Wars Galaxies for real cheap the other day, it's a basic shooter game. Fly around, blow stuff up, avoid other stuff, and get lots of points. Nothing like old school point runners!<br>  <br>  If you like old school SNES RPG's check out Final Fantasy 4- (aka Final Fantasy 2 for the states originally on the SNES) it's been redone with pretty new graphics and a couple of new dungeons. I've been playing a bit lately. I already beat it from the SNES days so I'm not in a big rush. Also out, is Chrono Trigger DS, another remake- but far superior to the playstation version that came out.  Great Old Classic. You can beat the final boss within 5 minutes of the start...if you're super powerful, but there's 9 (at least-) different endings depending on WHEN you beat the last boss. Great replay value on that one, but these will  both suck massive amounts of your freetime.|`|k3DdIDGoaa	Ok i'm only gonna name fun games that you would actually enjoy and not games like racing and fighting that wouls lead you no where.<br>  <br>  - Animal crossing wild world (FUN! buy ur own house, buy clothes, design ur own  clothes, go fishing, change ur furniture around and many more.<br>  <br>  - WarioWare touched (with 180 micro games! and some cool toys like a whistling, a piano, bubble blower, cameleon and many more)<br>  <br>  -Super mario 64 (Play the complete Nintendo 64 adventure, now with all-new characters, courses, game modes and challenges.)<br>  <br>  -Spectrobes (play as a boy or girl and train spectrobes <br>  <br>  -Spectrobes II (Now in wifi which makes it even better)

Your portal gun also looks black, which leads me to believe you used the black gun mod. Again, this is all speculation based on the info you gave.  So here is my theory.<br>  <br>  You are playing portal on the pc, and the trailers and videos you are watching were played on the xbox.  Different games, possibly different graphics.

There is also one (I think its called "power") from using the cheat boolProp.

AA10289438	My best advice would be to never use Gau again once you can switch him out of your party.  Gau is an absolutely usless character in comparison with all the other characters since his Rages are no better than the spells he can learn with Magicite.  Just use Magicite, and don't use Gau unless he's just going to be a magic user anyway.<br>  <br>  Ah, you haven't gotten that far in the game.  Magicite are items you will find later.  They can be equipped to a character to allow a non-magic user to learn magic.  For instance, the Ifrit Magicite will let you learn Fire1, Fire2, and Fire3.  (Maybe not, but that's the general idea.)  Due to the extreme usefulness of Magicite, it totally outweighs Gau's Rages.<br>  <br>  One final tip, later on, after the world changes, you'll be presented with the option to take the Ultima Magicite or the Ultima Sword.  Although the sword is steller, the Magicite is godly because all your characters can now learn the all-powerful spell, "Ultima."  Take the Magicite.<br>  <br>  --- Icarus, I didn't know that.  I didn't even know about the Cursed Shield.  Learn something new everyday.|`|AA11299045	I agree with the above, then only useful Rage I've found with Gau was the IO, but that's an end game enemy and a rarity on theVeldt. I personally, never use Gau, and I've played through this game a good dozen times. Another note on the above, the Magicite is useful but you can gain access to the ultima spell by getting the cursed shield and then fighting 255 battles with a character in your team equipped with it. The curse is lifted, it becomes the paladins shield and can teach you the Ultima spell. This is a much slower way to get the spell but if you want the sword and the spell that's the way to do it. Have fun!

nc3bzk41aa	been a long time since i played that game...<br>  <br>  but i think this is what i did:<br>  <br>  Clear the lower level of the room, then climb up onto the ledge with the machine that is spinning wildly out of control. Ignore the SWAT that come into the room ( it's a never-ending wave you're just wasting ammo). Go into first-person mode and target the three large anchors at the base of the machine. Destroy all three, and Ice and Corrupt can escape. Do a focus jump into the nearby hole to proceed.
dQBAqXCPaa	There are a couple of browser based MMORPGs out there, but none that use the java engine (what makes runescape unique). You could try playing bang howdy (It's also java based, but i wouldn't call it a MMORPG). I'm going to tell you about the browser based MMORPGs i know.<br>  To play games in flash, there are Dragon Fable and Adventure Quest (In both you have to pay to have full access to the game, and notice that Dragon Fable is still under construction and that it's hard for non-members to login into AQ). There are also those community based flash games (that some people consider to be MMORPGs) that are becoming really popular: Gaia Online (that I already played and that is really cool), ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, and i think that Habbo goes the same way; in all of this games you create an avatar and play games like fishing to get money and personalize those avatars.<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are OK. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it’s much like pokemoncrater, only that it doesn’t have lots of publicity, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  Have fun.

uB3XkES7aa	There are a few ways to get a Baby Neopet.<br>  <br>  1. You can buy a Baby Paintbrush, which costs around 600,000 neopoints. You can get one at the Trades, the Auctions, or the Hidden Tower.<br>  <br>  2. You can cross your fingers and hope that Boochi appears and zaps your pet. He is a random event that turns your active pet into a baby.<br>  <br>  3. You can get a Fountain Faerie Quest. She usually asks for rare items but the reward is a visit to the Rainbow Fountain, where you can choose which pet you want to choose and you can paint it.<br>  <br>  4. Get a morphing potion. They usually cost a lot and you can find one at the Trades or Auctions. Just search 'Baby (neopet name) Morphing Potion.<br>  <br>  5. Win one from a freebie place like the Fruit Machine. That's rare though.<br>  <br>  6. Win one from a contest. When you enter a contest and it says a number of neopoints plus a rare prize, that's usually a paint brush.<br>  <br>  7. Refer a number of people. I forget how much though.<br>  <br>  That's about it. ^^|`|198b7302a0c51f9f785cafc90e2d8defaa	you have to have a paint brush|`|AA12381704	You need an item called a baby pet brush.

AA11299045	You have to go into the main menu and set up the layout of your artes on the controller. You've got 4 "hotkeys" to use for fonic artes. O, up+O, down+O and left/right+O. Go to main menu, Artes and choose the character you're conrolling (you can't set the hotkeys unless you're conrolling that character so no setting up Tear if you're playing as Luke) Then you can customize which move you want to which quick command, hope this helps.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I love the peanutbutter playdough because they can eat it...<br>  <br>  Ingredients <br>  1/2 cup Peanut Butter <br>  1 cup powdered milk <br>  1/2 cup honey <br>  <br>  Just mix in a bowl and shape, then eat!<br>  <br>  And we make regular playdough too using this receipe:<br>  <br>  The following recipe is a big batch recipe. It is intended to be enough for a party or group of kids and makes about ten cups of play dough—the equivalent of twelve commercial Play Doh ? containers. If you want a smaller batch, divide the recipe in half. If you are having a really big party and want more play dough, make two batches--this recipe is about all that can be made in a stand-type mixer at one time. You can also make this play dough by hand.<br>  <br>  If you want multiple colors, divide the dough and knead in the food coloring after the dough is made. If one color is sufficient, add the food coloring with the water and save the step of kneading in the coloring. <br>  <br>  7-8 cups all-purpose or bread flour<br>  3 cups salt<br>  3 tablespoons cream of tartar<br>  1/4 cup vegetable oil<br>  4 cups hot water<br>  food coloring<br>  <br>  Mix seven cups of flour together with the salt and cream of tartar in the bowl of your stand-type mixer. Add the oil and water and knead with a dough hook in your electric stand-type mixer for five to six minutes. (If you are kneading by hand, knead for eight to ten minutes.) Add more flour to<br>  get a soft, workable dough. <br>  <br>  Store the dough in a sealed container to keep it from becoming dry. If it becomes too dry, place it back in the mixer bowl and knead in a dribble of water.<br>  <br>  What is Cream of Tartar?<br>  Potassium bitartrate also potassium hydrogen tartrate has formula KC4H5O6. It is a byproduct of wine making. It is also known as cream of tartar. It is a potassium acid salt of tartaric acid. Tartar crystallises in wine casks during the fermentation of grape juice. This crude form (known as beeswing) is collected and purified to produce the white, odorless, acidic powder used for many culinary and other household purposes, such as:<br>  <br>  Stabilising egg whites, increasing their heat tolerance and volume; <br>  Preventing sugar syrups from crystallising; <br>  Reducing discolouration of boiled vegetables; <br>  Frequent combination with baking soda (which needs an acid ingredient to activate it) in formulations of baking powder<br>  <br>  It can be found in the spice aisle!<br>  <br>  So there ya go ( =|`|0VpRAn7gaa	PLAYDOH   <br>  <br>  1 c. flour<br>  1 c. boiling water<br>  2 tbsp. cream of tartar<br>  1/2 c. salt<br>  1 tbsp. oil<br>  Food coloring<br>  <br>  Mix and knead together.

YiJRjeXAaa	The way to get to Pallet Town for the first time is to go through Diglett Cave just outside of Vermillion City. <br>  <br>  If it's still blocked by a Snorlax, use the Pokegear with an EXPN card (receive from an employee walking around in Kanto's radio station), and set on Poke Flute music to wake it up (it's near the end). Snorlax will then attack you. Be careful; it's level 50 and also holding Leftovers. Do whatever you can to catch it, and make sure to save before confronting him, since this is the only chance you have to catch one.<br>  <br>  After the battle is over, and you've successfully caught Snorlax, you can enter the cave. It's not called Diglett Cave for nothing; there are lots in there. When you emerge on the other side, head south to Viridian City, and south again to reach Pallet Town. You'll meet many trainers on the way who will want to battle, so be ready for them. Several carry bug pokemon.|`|B48sBOZSaa	In the first town u started in there is a lake ....swim across it and u find the Kanto region .....u need to walk there first<br>  <br>  probably take a cave.<br>  <br>  <(0.0)>|`|AA12388731	If my memory serves me correctly, you need to be in the Kanto region and have actually been to Pallet Town at least once before (Go through all of the houses there).|`|BbEztx4Faa	You have to visit there once first then on your next trips you can fly there|`|G2A3iyfgaa	go to viridian city and walk south. there should be pallet town.|`|I5ygrgzlaa	well mabye the game doesnt work so take it out and THROW IT IN THE POND AND GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NKm4YYnfaa	Just go through the story.

8c3ae85037668c2f91a55ff81f46f98eaa	The best site to download clothes, hair, make-up, and accessories for your sims is the official sims 2 website :<br>  <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/</a><br>  You must register before you download your items.<br>  I have had trouble with other sites and downloading items.

O yes, and its free!|`|3kCBgVDAaa	Modthesims2.com<br>  parsimonious.com<br>  thesims2.com|`|qS5VcNITaa	I tried the official site, but it turned out to be a bad choice, because you often don't get the mesh with the stuff you download. Try peggysims2.net, it is the best site so far, for me. I downloaded a lot of things from that site and they work just fine. When you download a file which is marked as "mesh included" or "no mesh required" just extract  the downloaded files (using WinRAR) to My documents\EA games\The Sims 2\Downloads, but if the hair or clothes are marked with "Mesh needed", just follow that link with big red letters and extract that mesh file in the same Downloads folder, and then you can download all the recolors as well (you can find more details about that on the site). You need the mesh for everything you download, it is the basic shape of an object in the game. If you don't have it, the object won't work. Have fun, but you should be careful, too. These files can damage your game, do not download stuff from the sites that look suspicious (although you never know which ones are and which are not), but I never had problems with peggysims2, you should try it.

AA10318035	I doubt it. My answer doesn't based on the story, but basically the business itself. Pokemon is one of the best sales game by Nintendo, and the anime itself is a form of promotion of the games (that is why all of the explanation in the anime and the game is similar).<br>  While people keep buying the product, it doesn't seems like they are going to stop producing new Pokemon.|`|LYQwhxQ6aa	i don't think it will end i mean theres a god of all pokemon but mews supposed 2 be the root of all of them and he came out in the 1st game. the series can't reali end, they just need 2 keep thinking of new regions and pokemon really|`|qYT8kUSPaa	I'm sure there will be, because you can make a lot of money off of pokemon.|`|szYlTBRhaa	im sure their will be, or there wouldve been a thing saying on diamond/pearl saying that this is the last of its series. im pretty confident there'll be more.|`|L3XmiwRDaa	I Agree with Jamie K|`|a4OWOlYOaa	you are wrong because if it ended it would be a big finish

fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	The only benefit you gain from putting the jewels in the mask is a slight increase in it's selling price. Don't worry about it though; you'll still end up with enough cash to buy/upgrade enough weapons. The spinels aren't designed to go in anything - you just sell them. There are plenty other items that can be combined with jewels in the same way as the mask, so keep your eye out, you can always tell which ones to sell straight away and which to combine. I certainly wouldn't bother starting again.|`|mGD2n4cNaa	Its just cash. Even if you dont combine items, you'll probably have enoug cash to buy good and decent weapons. Things get tough when you meet the Regenerators..<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, Jason|`|agBzPm1Zaa	That's the least of your worries<br>  <br>  cool game ;)|`|A64Qr7DMaa	youll be ok|`|QzD3rJtMaa	I agree with everyone else here when they say it is just money and that you shouldn't worry about it because you will have enough to play through the game and buy what you need.<br>  <br>  However, I must also note that money is money and that these items sell for an extremely higher price with all the jewels in place.  So if you aren't too far through the game, then you could always restart without losing much progress.  The game becomes a hell of a lot easier when you don't have to worry about buying things when you have enough money to spend.  Just a thought.|`|vBu2pb5raa	The first time I played Resident Evil 4, I did the same thing, and felt like a plonker afterwards. But it's cool, you lost a bit of cash, but not a massive amount. Just make sure from now on to Examine every bit of treasure that you find, because when you examine it, it tells you whether there is something that can be added to it to increase the value. Anyway, good luck and hope you're enjoying the game!!<br>  <br>  P.S The Spinels and velvet blues don't go in anything, you can sell them straight away. Just make sure to save the Cats Eyes, one of each colour, Red, Green and Blue I think.|`|d04a9da07aef2d62921925435d094e19aa	am pretty sure you can sell the jewels separately<br>  <br>  anyway there's loads more stuff out there to sell, i'd carry on|`|rcbeBKDyaa	the money is not a big worrier as you can get more things that give you money|`|a5iuxjjXaa	Don't worry about those. Those were just so you can make money.You'll be fine..|`|uctxzjIIaa	Spinels don't go in anything.<br>  <br>  With the items you can combine, not doing so only costs you about 25% of the combined value. Not a big deal overall.|`|BPNDa95Laa	it's just money.  you're fine.

ATvI1WmKaa	Good types to use are Dragon types, Psychic types, Water types, and Electric or Ground types.<br>  <br>  But really, just make sure you have a really varied move arsenal.  Its a good idea to have pokemon in your team that are quick.  Instead of a ground type, consider using another type and equipping with Earthquake instead.  These guys hit rather hard, especially Cynthia and Bertha.<br>  <br>  I'll try to remember the team I used when I first beat them..<br>  Luxray lv58 (moveset: Thunderbolt, Spark, Crunch, Discharge)<br>  Alakazam lv58: (moveset: Recover, Psychic, Psi Beam, Pycho Cut)<br>  Infernape lv55: (Flamethrower, Close Combat, Mach punch, Flame wheel)<br>  Golem lv53: (Earthquake, Rock slide, rock smash, rock throw)<br>  Floatzel lv56: (Waterfall, Crunch, Blizzard, Surf)<br>  Dialga lv51 yeah I know its a Legendary.. (Metal Claw, Heal Block, Roar of Time, Dragon Claw)<br>  <br>  It was a struggle, but we beat them.<br>  <br>  Here's another effective team.<br>  Salamence (moveset: Fly, Earthquake, Fire Blast/Flamethrower, Dragon Claw)<br>  Luxray (moveset: Thunderbolt, Return, Discharge, Crunch)<br>  Lucario (moveset: ExtremeSpeed, Reversal, Dragon Pulse, Aura Sphere)<br>  Gallade (Slash, Psycho Cut, Night Slash, Leaf Blade)<br>  Empoleon (BubbleBeam, Hydro Cannon, Drill Peck, Ice Beam)<br>  Alakazam (Psychic, Psybeam, Recover, Shadow Ball)<br>  <br>  Try to be as efficient as possible with your movesets.  While it is a good idea to have at least one move matching your pokemon's type, its also not good to focus just on those moves.  Vary them as much as possible, and pay attention to their effects.  Make each turn count.<br>  Good examples of this are my Gallade and Salamence.  Gallade is Psychic/Fighting.  Though it lacks a fighting type attack, it has Psycho Cut to match its type, and various other slashing (high critical hit ratio) moves, so it can take on a wider variety of opponents.  Salamence has Fly and Dragon Claw for its same type attack bonus moves, but I also gave it Earthquake and a Fire type move to allow to combat a wider range of foes, including Ice types, the bane of most Dragon types.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you go into it with plenty of items, especially Hyper Potions.  Keep at least 15-20 of them at the ready.  Also, avoid low PP moves like Fire Blast, Close Combat, and Hyper Beam.  Since Ethers can't be bought, you have to make do with any you might have picked up.  This a test of your team's endurance as much as their power, so its important that they use moves that have a sufficient amount of PP.|`|w4qS66aqaa	Lets first try to beat Aaron, his pokemon are beautifly, dustox, herracross, drapion and vespiqueen and he is a bug trainer so bring fire types like Infernape and Rapidash. Train these pokemon at Eterna forest and Route 221 or just victory road and Route 221. It also helps to have a ghost type for herracross and a rock type for vespiqueen because rock attacks do 4x damage but make sure it is not ground or you'll be wasting an attack.<br>  Second up Bertha, hippowdon, golem, whiscash, sudowoodu and quagsire, easy, I chose piplup as my starter but if you haven't you can always use grass types (this is an definate) and water types. If you want you can use ice types too. You should teach your grass types dome good moves like solarbeam (helps if it also knows sunny day) or leaf storm. Water types reallyshould have surf or hydro pump or even both. Be careful with ice types because golem could easily knock them out.<br>  Flint, rapidash, infernape, steelix, drifblim and loppuny, you need water and rock and ground type moves here desperatly. He is a tough trainer who has fast pokemon so aqua jet is a good attack here. Fighting types should be able to kick loppuny and a good high lv dark type for drifblim.<br>  Lucian, Mr mime, girafarig, alakazam, medicham and of course bronzong. Not including the champion he is the toughest by miles. Ghost and dark types work easy espeacially on medicham. If none choose a good strategy like lock on and then zap cannon, paralisise for sure (can't spell).<br>  Champion Cynthia, very tough to beat espeacially since all her pokemon are over lv 60. Roserade, gastrodon, garchomp, lucario, milotic and spiritomb. Garchomp is weak against ice types and roserade fire and psychic.<br>  Make sure you bring a variety of types. Good luck
bY0ffvpbaa	Storage is necessary these days. For games, it can install most of it onto the hdd from the disc, which usually takes up quite abit of space, if it doesn't install it uses the hdd to buffer the game onto. As for other media, people find it better to just rent a movie by downloading it from the store, currently i don't think they offer much selection, but i'm expecting that to change throught the year. Gamesaves now take up more space then they use to (1MB to around 50MB). Also the main O.S (operating system, firmware) has to go somewhere too. Hope this helps you.|`|MDf0BoiNaa	if you dont know why you need it, then you must not need it.<br>  <br>  its possible to copy movies and music that youve downloaded (either from the PSN store, or torrents and the like) onto the hard drive, to watch at your leisure (unlike xbox, which, while it is capable of playing most movie or music file types, it doesnt let you actually copy anything onto the hard drive). thats handy for someone like me, because i download lots of movies and tv shows, and its easy to just copy things on, and watch them later (on xbox, i need to copy things onto a usb stick and watch them off that)<br>  <br>  the space could also be used for downloadable games, but first off, there is no ps3 available without a hard drive at all, and even the smallest one has far more than enough room on it to download all the games and have space to spare. even if you run out of room (or delete them for any reason) you can freely re-download anything youve purchased from the PSN store without being charged.<br>  <br>  as i said before, if it isnt abundantly clear why more space could be useful to you, then you dont have the habits that would make use of it.<br>  get whatever one you want, though you should be aware that the models with different sized hard drives all have different features, the 60Gb one being the best. refer to this table for which model comes with what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3#Retail_configurations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation...</a>|`|0JSfvCHPaa	It is so you can save games without the need to buy memory cards or extra storage, sometimes it can be cheaper to download movies or games (i think fifa 09 can be downloaded for around ￡20). I think the reason behind PS3s having storage space (a hard disc drive) was simply so you could save things. It's also needed for updates which are regularly sent out and updates to games. There are also games available via the Playstation store that can be downloaded and can't be obtained in any other way.

Blastoise and Raichu are great, so I recommend these moves for them:  Blastoise: Hydro Cannon, Rain Dance, Skull Bash and surf. Your blastoise will have to be about level 55.    Raichu:(don't evolve your pikachu into raichu until you have a preferred move set, because it will not learn level up moves) Mega kick, Thunderbolt, Rain dance, Thunder. Your Pikachu should be at least level 26 before you use a thunder stone.    I also recommend these:   Snorlax with Immunity ability(You can catch only two in the whole of Kanto, one can be found on route 16): belly drum, rest, psychic and body slam. It will have to be about level 33.    Dratini with shed skin ability (You can get one with 4600 points at the Celadon City game corner. It will evolve into high power hitter Dragonite at level 55 after evolving it into Dragonair.) Outrage, Hyper beam, flamethrower and Fly.    I love Sneasel with its inner focus ability. (I always have one in my party. You can catch one only in leaf green in Icefall Cave on four island. Although, its a second generation Pokemon, it can still be caught in LG.) Slash, Ice beam, beat up and swords dance. It will need to be level 64 at least. They are actually caught at a high level anyway, so it doesn't matter to train it.    And lastly I recommend Nidoqueen or Nidoking with the poison point ability. (Train a Nidoran from a low level, which can be found nearly anywhere, so to get a lot of low-level powerful moves before evolving them with a moon stone.) Earthquake, Shadow ball, Superpower and sludge bomb. It will have to be about level 43.    Okay,so those are my suggestions. Hopefully I helped. Good luck!!|`|PEGZmw73aa	Don't listen to them, pokemon is a classic.    As for your team, I'd say having two fire types isn't the best strategy, but it's okay.    Maybe find a replacement for Dragonair or Dragonite.    Try a grass or ground type?    Like Golem or something else.    Good pokemon though.|`|Nk01IQ9Yaa	twilight speaks the truth|`|Rd9QMpZLaa	POkemon is NOT gay, the two people above who said so are!   as for your team that is really weak and i'm not talking about levels.    you should have  charizard/ arcanine not both   dragonite  articuno  heracross - its on one of the sevi island. you might have a huge rock weakness and heracross is strong against rocks.  mewtwo    now you need a water or grass type, but I'll suggest one of the following  pokemon anyways:    lapras, really strong against the elite for  and it will totally destroy Gary if you give it the right moves. it will compliment your team very well too.    snorlax- really good pokemon and you can catch two throughout the game.    raichu/zapdos- not reall needed if you have lapras or mewtwo with thunderbolt but they can be helpful in the elite four.    tyranitar- found deep down in the last sevi island, really powerfull and can be useful.    my team  lapras  charizard  tyranitar  heracross  dragonite  snorlax  with mewtwo and articuno as reserves.    my team

4er9SBgWaa	The simple answer is that you shouldn't do it.  It's a serious game glitch that gives you an advantage over other players not gained through greater skill or luck.  This is cheating and you'll often find that the people who do said glitches have higher scores, yes, but what does that higher score mean if it's reached through cheating?  It means squat.<br>  People who glitch are also often the ones who boast about their scores.  Just get on the ground, do some shooting.<br>  tips for getting better at FPS so you don't NEED to glitch are available on the web, there are numerous FAQs and advice forums for getting better at these games.<br>  glitchers are cheaters, there's no way round it.<br>  <br>  here are a few links if you want:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/are-you-a-first-person-shooter-n00b/" rel="nofollow">http://chris.pirillo.com/are-you-a-first...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-in-a-First-Person-Shooter" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-in-a-Firs...</a><br>  <br>  <br>   pax

JCdBSULraa	Final Fantasy is a chain of games dating back to the 80s.  Every couple years, a new one is released, which has nothing to do plot-wise with the previous games, although there's usually some shared elements from game-to-game.   They are available on:    NES:  Final Fantasy 1-3  SNES:   Final Fantasy 4-6  Playstation 1:   Final Fantasy 7-9 (7&8 are also available for PC)  Playstation 2:   Final Fantasy X  Final Fantasy X-2  Final Fantasy XII    Almost all FF games are console games, however, Final Fantasy XI, not mentioned above is available for PC and PS2, but the PS2 version requires a hard drive and internet connection.  FF XI (11) is an online MMORPG.   imho, there are much better MMORPGs out there if you want to get into them, but Final Fantasy makes some really great console games.   Whether you go PC or PS2 for FFXI, there is a monthly subscription required.    Final Fantasy XIII is scheduled for release sometime this year I believe for both PS3 and XBox 360.  It will actually be 3 different games on different CDs, 1 of them may have subscription costs, but I'm not sure.|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	The only online Final Fantasy is eleven, which I would not recommend. Final Fantasy 1-10, and 12 are all for the PS2. They are definitely worth it, but I would say that FF 8 and 9 are the best.|`|r4FJjEGiaa	FFXI is online and its online ONLY! you have to play online because it is a MMORPG just like World of Warcraft, Everquest, etc and requires a subscription. - I played it for like a year, great game.  However, every other Final Fantasy game is just like a normal RPG but they are best ever. If you are looking for a good RPG go with FFVII from the ps1 but thats really old skool lol.|`|YFKwT1owaa	FFX=Best game ever|`|q6uyloYdaa	Yes, you do have to pay monthly for Final Fantasy XI. Even if you don't play for 3 weeks out of a month, you still CAN play if you choose to, so you have to pay.  I personally haven't played it but apparently it plays pretty well for an MMO considering the fact that it's on a console.  Also, I believe the Age of Conan MMO is going to be released on the 360 as well, so if you didn't like FFXI but wanted to play an MMO, there's another option.|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	Yes you have to. Final fantasy XI Is a ONLINE ONLY game It's an MMORPG  There Is no "Offline" Mode To play. So yes you have to pay the fee to play. It's a pretty good game, Kinda hard and gets boring at points.  I would not get it.  Play the other final fantasy games (1-10)  To know If you even Like the Genre of the game.|`|NuiHXYuOaa	its wack - pure and simple|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	If you buy Final Fantasy XI Online, yeah, you do.  It really sucks.  Pay Xbox Live fee THEN pay them.  And you can't play it on your own.    However, Final Fantasy XIII will be released for the xbox when it comes out, so you could give it a shot then.    Most of them are pretty good though.|`|Yo0R3jsoaa	i dont belive you have to pay exept buying the game itself and it fun to play with its uniq structures and weapon swords etc the charecters are very uniq but i would recomend playing one of the older final fantasys before this one to get the idea about whats going on|`|lqN2WfEuaa	1) No    2) Maybe because u are a guy and u have teamates and u choose moves to kill people. Its an RPG bassically. If u get final fantasy crystal chronicles they are final fantasy games that ARNT RPGs. U run around and kill stuff ... :P

Xbox has more games and better 'exclusive' ones.    personally i plug an xbox controller into my PC and play the 'ported xbox games' on my TV as i have a HDMI running to it....so i get the best of both!|`|4CwzcJmMaa	I HAVE BOTH SYSTEMS THE 360 IS THE BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS BETTER  GRAPHICS THE ONLY THING THAT THE PS3 HAS ON THE 360 IS BLUE RAY|`|AbbMK8Mraa	yes the ps3 is the best xbox sucks the ps3 dont dye the xboe does a thing after a while called the ring of fire and then crashes the green light turns red the dyes so go ps3 and the grapichs are better
E4lCNXPjaa	Sometimes they forget to block HTTPS sites.  First try https://www.vtunnel.com  If that doesn't work you are pretty much out of luck unless you have a computer savvy friend that can set a proxy up on the outside.|`|JCdBSULraa	There's no quick solution, but there are ways around most proxies.    Look into SOCKS proxies on the internet for your solution.  You'll need a server that can host such things as well as the flexibility to release and obtain a static IP address (so you can change it if your proxy server gets blocked).  I'm assuming you're talking about gaming too, otherwise, simple web proxies like PHProxy will work, but you'll again need a web server you can change the IP address on.  Also, do not get a domain name with your server, otherwise your school's proxy will just block the domain and you'll get stuck.|`|VlR0y7Fvaa	Wait until you get home.

AA12383033	Demos dont have them most of the time
GqJjMPEaaa	The only way to eliminate the line of purl bumps on the wrong side at the color changes is to use a technique called double knitting. There is no wrong side in double knitting -- both sides are stockinette, and the colors are the exact opposite on either side. So the wrong side will have large black keys and small white keys.<br>  <br>  Here's a free video that explains double knitting (scroll down): <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/advanced-techniques" rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/advan...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some free patterns for double-knit piano scarves:<br>  <a href="http://jukeboxheroine.blogspot.com/2008/11/dancing-on-keys-finished.html" rel="nofollow">http://jukeboxheroine.blogspot.com/2008/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.menwhoknit.com/community/?q=node/7956#attachments" rel="nofollow">http://www.menwhoknit.com/community/?q=n...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, all you can do is hide the wrong side. You could make the scarf twice as wide, then fold it over & seam all three sides. Or cast on twice as many stitches & knit in the round. This way your scarf is a tube, and the color changes are hidden inside. (Like double knitting, it makes the scarf twice as thick and requires twice as much yarn.) <br>  <br>  Or you could cut a piece of black or white fleece to fit & sew it (with a sewing machine or by hand) to the wrong side as a lining.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for weaving in the ends, if your color changes happen every few rows you can run the unused color up the side, twisting the two yarns together every two rows. <br>  <br>  Knitty.com has a very good tutorial that shows you how to best hide your ends in either stockinette stitch or garter:<br>  <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEfall04/FEATfall04TT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEfall04/FEATfa...</a>|`|M9FQSKRwaa	here is a video that will show you how to change colors.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitting-tips" rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitt...</a><br>  its half way down under duplicate stitch join.
h2bpjvG4aa	no no no no, and a quintuple no, it will never be released on the wii, it was made exclusively for Sony's Playstation 3 and the company who made it (Media Molecule) are owned by Sony. The wii does not have the technological capabilties to run that game without compromises, so quite frankly it will never happen, Sony would not want one of their franchises to help Nintendo's console in sales or otherwise|`|MDf0BoiNaa	yeah kobina's right, except that media molecule, while it has backing from sony (like guerrila who makes killzone, or insomniac, who does lots os playstation exclusives like resistance and ratchet & clank) they are not expressly owned by sony (neither are those other companies)|`|k6CSa9caaa	I don't think so, it was meant as a PS3 exclusive but anything can happen in these money hungry days.|`|0nvXYAZUaa	no, never in a million years.

mxdcQBxRaa	Don't listen to that guy you can't cheat or if you can they will find out and get you arrested for hacking. The best way to make money on runescape is trading. Before trade rules where you could sell what you liked for what price you wanted I made about 1ML per hour but now I think the best way to make money is to do herblore and farming. Don't do fletching its a waste of time.|`|hsUlg7Q9aa	It depends... I'd say the best combat orientated way to make money would be killing aviansies in the god wars (You need 41 prayer and 60+ range), where you can make a good 300k per hour at level 90+<br>  If you are like level 20 with low stats then you should pick flax, spin it, and sell it as bowstrings.<br>  However, I am afraid I can't help you if you are a skiller, because I don't know any decent ways to make gold without high combat stats :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out

QzD3rJtMaa	The simple answer to your long question is no.  You cannot Special Summon him from the graveyard once he leaves the field.  The card specifically states that he cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by tributing 3 Fiends.  This is the ONLY way he can be Special Summoned and ONLY if he was in your hand.  A lot of people seem to think that because it doesn't specify that you can Special Summon him from the graveyard using the same method.  That is false.  You can only Special Summon cards with such effects from your hand.  The effects do not count if they are in the graveyard.
h41PorIgaa	yubel can attack but cannot kill anything or hurt your opponents life points exept from its effect, i agree with the user who posted exiled force ect, but in order to keep yubels forms in play you must tribute i monster or she will be disdroyed and cannot activate her card level up, scapegoat and giant trunade is a good combo to keep yubels 3 card forms in play, because she will rip apart your army of monsters as long as she is out|`|VGetXBcNaa	First of all, less question marks.<br>  Yubel CAN Attack, but he won't kill anything, so no point in that.<br>  <br>  The point of Yubel is to destroy him quickly with Exiled Force, Tribute to the Doomed, etc. Once he is DESTROYED (Not Tributed, Not Discarded), You may summon one Yubel - The Terror Incarnate from your Deck, Hand, or Graveyard.<br>  <br>  Yubel CANNOT be destroyed by battle, read the card for god's sake.<br>  Of course you can destroy Yubel without using your own traps, just let the opponent destroy it or use a card like Exiled Force.<br>  <br>  Heres my Yubel Deck just for Kicks.<br>  <br>  Yubel Deck<br>  Yubel x2<br>  Yubel - The Terror Incarnate<br>  Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare<br>  Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World x3<br>  Sillva, Warlord of Dark World x3<br>  Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World x2<br>  Mystic Tomato x2<br>  Dark Necrofear<br>  Doom Shaman x2<br>  The Tricky x2<br>  Raviel, Lord of Phantasms x2<br>  Mystical Space Typhoon<br>  Monster Reborn<br>  Lightning Vortex x2<br>  Foolish Burial x2<br>  Monster Reincarnation x2<br>  Limit Reverse x2<br>  Raigeki Break x3<br>  Deck Devastation Virus x2<br>  Birthright x2<br>  Dark Illusion x2<br>  40 Cards<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  Jaa~ -- Sexy|`|XiOfPxpdaa	yubel's efect kills evrything exsept herself even the oponent's LP cuzz if she battles an oposing monster that moster's attack is delt to the oponent as damege and you and yubel take no damge, so i've ben thinking of combos to force the oponent to summon monsters so yubel can deal damge if she's beten she comes back stronger untill the 3rd form ultimite nightmare or you could combined her with neos to summon neos wiseman who can only be destroyed by battle and each destroyed monsters power is added to your LP and as damge to the oponent as i said even thoe she has no points her efect kills evrything exsept herself cuzz after all 1st form you tribut monsters for her stanghth each turn, 2ed form her efect is just like dark hole, 3rd form she just desroys evrything in sight

EUaIGX0Gaa	First get to Eterna city. Next to pokemon centre there is a house. The old man inside the house is the underground man he gives you the explorer kit.<br>  <br>  Go underground and and get a couple if spheres, then you can talk to the hiker people underground and trade your spear so a drill trap, then go to the wall (whereever you want) and drill a hole in the wall.<br>  <br>  A caven will open then you can trade more sphere with the man underground (note some sell traps and some sell goods) and you can put them in your secert base. their will also be bolders you can remove them when you talk to a friend underground who also has a DS and the game and by time some of the bolders will be removed .<br>  <br>  Hope this helps <br>  Mip|`|uAMUG0xaaa	In pokemon diamond, there aren't secret bases in certain places in the<br>  game like the 3rd generation games (emerald,sapphire, and ruby). When<br>  you get to Eterna city in the game, search a few houses, and an old man<br>  should be there who will let you go to a location called the Underground.<br>  Inside the Underground, you can get items you can't egt any other way,<br>  and also create a secret base. If you don't like where your base is, there<br>  are merchants who will buy things you dig up and don't want, and also<br>  buy "spheres" which you dig up. You can trade these "spheres" for things like a new "digger drill" to relocate your secret base, and new items for your base. Where you are in the pokemon world when you go to the underground depends on what location you are in. If you go to the Underground while in Eterna City you go to the largest location.<br>  I hope this helped!|`|6yMJbBuEaa	First you have to go to Eterna City and talk to the 'Underground Man' in the house near the Pokémon Centre. He should give you an Explorer Kit including the Digger Drill item. The Explorer Kit will be in your Key Items pocket. Use it anywhere outside, and you will fall down into the Sinnoh Underground.<br>  <br>  After talking to Roark on your first visit underground, you can hit pause and go into the 'Traps' part of the menu. The Digger Drill should be there. (If you don't have one, dig up some Spheres from the walls first and talk to one of the Hikers scattered around the Underground to buy a Digger Drill from him) Face a wall, click the Digger Drill, and you'll make a secret base. <br>  <br>  You can remove more boulders in the base as you capture more flags, which you can do when you link up with other games.|`|gxpeKrOtaa	Down in the under, there should be a man standing around, and he will sell you a drill. You can use it to make a secret base. You can also get one in Eterna City in the house by the pokemon center.

You run out of mana like crazy as Destro at lower levels so you have more downtime and downtime is boooring! :P I prefer Aff myself.

It'd be a good idea to drain soul right before the mob dies to get the extra mana back from imp drain soul talent and a soul shard which are always good.<br>  And in instances just dot and shadow bolt spam.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what would be good for destro for leveling though.. and if you want to go demo you pretty much just get all the talents that buff your demon...|`|8wxRjy0waa	Destruction build is good but i would go with demonology

They are better for soloing, wanted more in groups, and can pretty much beat anyone in pvp. Even though any class can beat any class Warlocks are overall better. Lets say they are both at level 10. If the paladin tries to come close to the warlock they the warlock can just fear him away. Since at 10 the pally has no long range attacks the warlock just puts all of his DOTs on the pally and let his imp, not void walker cause they are for tanking but let his imp attack. When the pally tries to come back just fear him away and then start it all over again. You just have to be ready to use life tap to get your mana back and then healthstone to restore health. Warlocks are most likely the best class class from my perpective and a great class to start you off with a new character. Plus with the Warlock you will be used to pets.|`|NNPe3i2Kaa	Warlocks are great for solo exping, they can tank with voids and have a really good dots.<br>  Paladins, well they can heal out pretty easily out of any hard situation be it pvp or pve.|`|kILoR7G4aa	When Warlock is leveled high He can do TONS of damage over a short span of time.
