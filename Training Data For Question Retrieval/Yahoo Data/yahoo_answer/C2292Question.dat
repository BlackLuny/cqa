20081010081409AABOH30	Education & Reference;Preschool	How is the American Kindergarten system?	In a German Kindergarten, children start with the age of 2 (nowadays even for children as babies, which we call the "Kinder grippe")   Well, the go to Kindergarten for 3years at the least and there they learn how to play with other children. They learn by playing board games and puzzles how to concentrate and achieve goals that they make. Many people see it as a waist of time and nothing but playing. The "playing" strategies is used to keep the children interested. They also have curtain times where they eat snacks and later lunch. They have times where they play outside and when wet outside, in a smalled sports room where they can run out their energy, play and test themselves with what they are good at and what they like to do.   there is much more to say about it, but i don't want this too get to long, its just the main things.   now to my question, can you explain to me (sort of the way i did about the German system) how the Kindergarten is in the US??   I need the information for a report and also for my own interest.   Thanks you

Girls never like me. The preschool girls, I mean   okay well teenage girls don't like me, too, cause i'm really straightforward (not in a b*tchy way, im really helpful)   and im always positive/happy      The preschool boys always start talking to me out of the blue (even when they don't know me)       So guess what...I have been assigned to work 2 days a week with a girl.   She said boldy at the end of our session that she had NO FUN and she does not want to return.      What can I do to make her trust/like me?

20081106174149AAL4iun	Education & Reference;Preschool	Help...I teach preschool and no matter what I say to this one parent, it's not the right thing.?	I told this parent that their child had an off day.  We'll the parent went to the director and said all she ever hears about is how bad her child is, never anything good.  So when the director told me this I was like I never tell parents their child is bad.  Then I would only talk to the parent about good stuff.  I usually tell parents your child had a good day and something that I know they enjoyed like playing catch for instance or who they enjoyed playing with.  That was never good either.  The parent said that it would be nice to hear in detail but how good of a day their child had.  So I am affraid to even talk to the parents now.  Any advice as to what more I can do to make the parents happy, because know they are saying their son's saying he doesn't like school.  I don't understand where that is coming from because he seems happy everyday.  I don't have this problem with other parents and they say how their children can't wait to come to school.  So I'm at my wits end...and I get nervous to even talk to the child's parents when they pick up their son.  Any help or advice would be great.

It just made me a little nervous (okay very nervous) to hear.  He's already tried to leave the classroom already.

20081021094501AA7Lxyo	Education & Reference;Preschool	My grandson is not meeting teachers expectations, he is 4. ?	My step daughter came to us this morning overly worried that the teacher is grading Dylan, and saying he doesn't make the grade. My situation is a double edge sword for me. I know that he knows and is capable of the things asked of him. He chooses not to. On one hand he is lazy and on the other I am disappointed in the teacher that she doesn't observe his abilities outside of time for testing. Then I explained to my step daughter that she needs to be structured. She has none. I have suggested several times that she have a regular routine, but of course I am only the step mother and have to keep reminding myself to step back. I am not her favorite person. In fact she hates me no matter how much I have tried to love her for the past 11 years she continually puts me in my place. I also think this is why she has trouble with Dylan. He sees the way she acts and thinks it's okay. Although, he is very very good for me and my husband. He shows how smart he is to us all the time. I would go as far as to say he is an angel. But, he has structure and rule to follow when he is with us.

20090205142157AACrdIf	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	What am I suppose to do with the SHSAT?	I had just gotten my score back (not good) :( I got a 483, but it was the highest of my friends, so that was good. I want to retake the test, but I read the part of the SHSAT book my school gave us for 9th graders and it said that the math is on what we learn in 8th grade. That should sound great (the fact that I get a 98 average), but our school's curriculum is way behind. What we were suppose to learn in 7th grade (which was what was on the SHSAT) we are learning currently! So if our school is learning 7th grade material, how will I be able to catch up? Unless I take a course. I want to complain, but I don't want to create an issue (even though the subject is pretty big). I really want to get into Bronx Science or Stuyvesant, but I just heard they score it on a 1000 point scale not a 800 point scale. If I do retake it what books should I use? I also recently (a few minutes ago >.<) found out about this "Summer Discovery Program". I don't know if I qualify for it or not and what I have to do to get in. Along with that, if we do get accepted through that program do we start on 9th grade or still have to start on 10th grade just as if we took the test again? So I need help on this. Please answer quickly!!! I would appreciate it! Thanks in advance!

20060820200518AAzZesQ	Education & Reference;Other - Education	CLAWS vs CROSS?	I believe long finger nails are usually not allowed at most high schools for safety & hygiene reasons BUT girls with claws are not pulled up for violating uniform rules.      The school concerned had better get all their staff together and go through their school's uniform regulations and make sure that while they object to one item of accessory but allow - as an example: long finger nails  WHEN  the rule book also clearly stated: NO long finger nails, is practising double standards.        Sometimes the schools themselves are unsure of what exactly is allowed or not allowed.  Many schools actually left the interpretation  of uniformity to the teachers.  Then it depends on the teachers to book or not to book a student for not in uniform.  Uniform rules then becomes a joke because only a strict teacher will book.

I'll be a junior in high school next year (USA) and I'd like to study abroad in Germany second semester next year. However I barely know any German. My entire family is German, but barely any of them speak it fluently. Is it possible to pick up on the language quickly if I'm doing coursework for credit? I've taken Spanish for 6 years now, but no German other than language tapes and the sort.

20090205150737AA4YUxL	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Tips for an essay 10 points best answer?	hello, so im supposed to be pretending im a senator that is proposing a bill. My bill is to prohibit the buying, selling, and possession of handguns.    please i need a good grader than knows about this subject. im in 7th grade, and my teacher grades hard cause he was previously a lawyer okay so this is my persuasive speech about my bill                      Senator Sam Cherfass speech on law  8    I am in favor of the bill that will prohibit the buying, selling, possession of firearms because I personally feel that guns cause so many casualties whether if it is homicide, suicide or just a mere accident.    But more importantly, what is gun control? Why do we need it? Is it really worth the money? Do the pros over power the cons of this bill? These are all questions a citizen would ask about this bill.    Gun control is the regulation of the sale and use of firearms. According to the centers for disease control and prevention, roughly 30,000 people are killed by guns in the U.S than in any other developed countries, making this an important issue. But guns are not only involved in deaths. For instance in 2003, there were roughly 348,000 murders, robberies, and aggravated assaults in which guns were used.    Now is the time to act. The federal Bureau of investigation reports that in 2008, the U.S murder rate rose 5%, the largest one year increase since 1991! But what are the cons. Every bill has cons and so does ours. Mentions of the NRA, (the national rifle association, the largest- gun rights lobbying group) work hard to keep the 2nd amendment and have won every case to keep it from being erased. But when this bill is passed, this will change.  Since 1939, the Supreme Court has not lead any further 2nd amendment cases, the most recent ruling. In 1997, overturned part of the 1993 Brady bill, but did not address 2nd amendment rights.    The Brady Bill, passed by the United States Congress signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 30, 1993, and went into effect on February 28, 1994. The act was named after James Brady, who was shot during an attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. The Brady Bill initially required purchasers to wait up to five days for a background check to occur before being allowed to purchase a handgun. Unfortunately, The five-day waiting period for handgun purchases expired on November 30, 1998 and was replaced by a computerized criminal background check prior to any firearm purchase from a dealer holding a Federal Firearms License (FFL).    According to gun control written by Tom streissguth, people against gun control feel gun control laws are a threat to the personal freedoms of America. On the other hand, according the federal bureau of investigation, who recently conducted a survey, which stated that 91% of Americans in a survey of 1000 thought that there, should be at least minor restrictions on gun ownership?  But what also did American people think, after all this is a democracy, 57% of Americans say that there should be a major restrictions or a ban.    Innocent children also suffer from guns. According to the federal Bureau of investigation, 40% of homes in the U.S have guns. In 1996, 140 children died after being accidentally shot. According to on the issues, a registered database, 1,500 children are hurt every year. How can we let the future of America die so young?    The founding fathers knew that over time laws would have to be changed. That is why they made the laws capable of being amended. Honestly, do you really think that because of the 2nd amendment the founding fathers would know this would cause 260,000,000 firearms being on the streets and roughly 30,000 people dying each year because of firearms?    With deaths involving guns, occurring a lot more than in any other well developed country, This bill will make this horrifying statistic untrue in less than six months.

I have to start looking for colleges soon, and I'd like to have at least an idea of what I want to major in before I decide.      But that's the problem - I have absolutely no idea what I want to major in.      I love to write and act, but you can't really have a career in writing or acting. I want to be a doctor, but my mother reminded me that they have very little family time. I've always wanted to be an archaeologist, but you can't do that, especially in this area.      That's another problem. I hate the area I live in (It's near Fonda). It's so tiny. But I love my family and I don't want to move too far from them. At least not permanently.

I'm just curious :]      Well first of all, I don't live in America so my school system might be different than yours. (This is why I'm curious about your school, lol)   I'm in the tenth grade/Year 11.      My school starts at 8: 00.    Then I would have 3 lessons lasting for 40 minutes each.   Break time would be at 10:00 until 10:20.   I would have 3 lessons again lasting for 40 minutes each.   Second break would be at 12:20 until 12:40.   Another session of 3 lessons lasting for 40 minutes each.   School ends at 14:40.      I don't change class room. I have a permanent class room and permanent seating. There are less than 10 people in my class. I take 9 subjects which includes Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Maths, English, IT(Computer Studies), French, Geography and English Literature.      It sounds extremely boring I know...   Really tiring though.   So, would you like to tell a little bit about your school schedule?

20090205120358AAiEtuU	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Off school lunch sdggugudduegugeufuegfeggeuf?	The off campus lunch restriction can be dangerous because there could be fights     And shootings at the restraints. They could be band from there or the restraint could get     The school in trouble with the law. People could get hurt and even killed with all the gang     Violence that goes on these days. But the good side of this story is the off campus     Lunches. That we would be able to have a better variety of food. Instead of the same thing     Every day at school.               You can have a different a variety of food. Plus the freedom from school relieves     You from all the pressure and gives you a break from your teachers. Being able to leave     School at lunch at lunch time gives you enough time to go home and get something you     Forgot for one of your classes. Plus your food would be a lot healthier. Also this     Time gives you a chance to do your homework you forgot to do for classes.            I think that if we had this. That our grades would improve. So lets give off school    Campus lunches another chance.

20090205123013AAi7JE9	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How can I get a security guard "in trouble" at my school? :]?	Well, at our school we're not allowed to be inside the school unless we have some after school activity, even if we're just by the doors waiting for our ride.   Sooo, the dumb security guards kick us outside (And it's about 13 degrees where I'm at :] Nice, huh? D:) and we have to wait in that super cold weather for our ride.      So, now to where it's not fair:   I get out of class a little late 'cause I wanted to finish my work, and then me and my girlfriend get our stuff from our locker and start walking towards the main office.   As we're walking, one of the security guards named Paul (Remember that name, peoples. :D) is walking past us, but then he turns around and then just starts following us and saying "Oh, the doors to the bathroom are locked and I'm NOT opening them." and laughing while saying it. So, I say something back like, "Well, I wasn't even going to the bathroom, I was getting water" And then he claims that my girlfriend was going, which she wasn't either.      Once we get in the main office the girl security guard Janice comes in and is like, "Okay, you gotta leave" and harassing me.   I'm not doing ANYTHING. I'm standing behind the desk and waiting for whoever was on the phone to get off.   So, then..when I start telling her I'm waiting for the phone she starts asking my name and asking to see my book so she can make sure I gave her the right name.   She writes it down, and then claiming that I'm being argumentative.   So, now, Paul comes in   and now theyr'e both ganging up on me, saying how I can wait outside for my grandma and I don't need to use the phone.   Buuuut I didn't know I would have to stay after, so I couldn't call her earlier, and I shouldn't have to have some reason for using the phone, they don't need to know my personal life.   SO, Basically, I get all mad, I leave, I come back, I try again, she comes back, claims to write me up, I go back outside, I get picked up   ..and Now I wanna get them both in trouble.   'cause that's not fair.      1st of all: You can't have kids waiting outside for hours in that cold.   2nd: You need a pretty good reason for kicking me out for using the phone. They don't know my personal life, and my mom told me if I had to stay after to call my grandma immediately, which they were preventing me from doing. So, I had to use some guy's phone I didn't even know who was standing outside the school, AND THEN I finally got picked up. Sooo dumb. :/      I know if I talk to the right person with my mom with me, I could get SOMETHING happen to them, but I dun know who to talk to.      Does anyone else agree this is REALLY dumb? D:
