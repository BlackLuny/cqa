20070523213246AA9ejCg	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What is a Grease Trap and How do I find out if we have one?	I work for a small Chinese Family Buffet.  We have been in Open for almost a year now.  The building we have has been seven other restraunts.  The other day we recived a letter for the City saying that they have been finding large amounts of grease in the pipes and that we had 30 days to install a grease trap.                 No one who works there (including myself) knows what a grease trap is.  I would assume that if the place has been 7 other food places and open for sevral years it should alread have a grease trap.  I need to know how to find out if we have a grease trap or not.     Also, I need to know how to get a grease trap if we don't have one.            The letter mentioned having the grease trap pumped every three months.  Who do we call to pump it?       Please let me know if you have any information about this.  Thanks.

20080925084147AAE0OP1	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Is it fair to pay half the rent when 3 people are sharing a 2 bedroom?	In May I moved into my friend's 2 bedroom apartment.  Our rent is 1250 and all the utilities are included.  In July her sister moved in since she was starting her first year of college.  My friend and her sister share a bedroom.  My friend said nothing about her sister paying rent and I continued to pay half the rent.  Now that it's been 3 months, I'm starting to feel that it isn't fair.  Her sister doesn't even help out with buying groceries that we all share.  She also hasn't been cleaning.  I brought it up to my friend last night that I feel it would be more fair to me to pay a lower rent than half but not as little as a third since they are sharing a bedroom and I get my own.  My friend thinks of rent in terms of bedrooms and thinks me paying half the rent is fair.  My friend offered that she would buy all the stuff we all share, but it doesn't make that much of a difference because we don't share a whole lot. My friend is paying for everything for the sister and the parents don't help financially.  I feel sorry for my friend, but at the same time, the financial burden should not be on me.      Who is being unfair here?  I am seriously considering moving out soon because the way the sister is being babied really gets to me.  I think that it's time for her to grow up a little bit.

20090202130923AAMYWO9	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	"Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current."?	Does anyone know what that means?  My first thought is it means power surges.  That phrase in my homeowners insurance policy as covered.  We had an ice storm last week with power surges and major power outages.  The first power surge -- 6 hours before my power went out -- messed up my furnace.  I called the insurance company, and the agent said that they had a meeting with the higher-ups Saturday and were told that power surges were not going to be covered.  I find that highly suspicious!  It does exclude loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component, but we're talking a furnace here, not a TV.  Any thoughts?
