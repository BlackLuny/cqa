20090203114829AAhpazx	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What can I use in place of refried beans?	My boyfriend and I hate beans... especially refried beans because they taste like gross mush. It's a texture thing. Anyway, he's coming over for dinner tonight and I found a good Enchilada Casserole recipe I'd like to try. It requires refried beans. Is there something I can use instead? I was thinking guacamole (I know... similar texture to beans, but I like it... go figure) but he doesn't like guacamole. What else could I use, or would it be okay to simply leave them out of the meat mixture? Here's the recipe btw:       http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Enchilada-C... 
20090203114820AATdKXv	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Where can I find a list of "vegetarian" foods that have meat in them?	I've been a vegetarian for about a year and 2 weeks now, but I still find it hard and a lil embarrassing sometimes to ask the nice restaurant waiters if the vegetable soup is made with chicken broth or vegetable broth, or if the beans in the burrito are made with animal fat...  I've looked through a few vegetarian websites, and here and there I've found little tips about certain foods that contain meat (like McDonald's 'secret' french fries' ingredient that are made with beef extract lol nice).  But isn't there SOMEWHERE that I can find a list or certain foods, or popular restaurants, maybe popular brands of food at the grocery store?!    I'd be soooo grateful.  Thank you so much in advance.      ps....  I don't feel like I should put this in here, but please don't comment rudely on my personal choices lol I understand 'you' LOOOVE meat and your the daughter of a butcher... many ppl have beat you to the punch. sorry  :)

20090221041538AAnea2T	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How to cook PRE-PACKAGED, FROZEN Ribeye and NY Strip Steaks?	First, I haven't prepared very many steaks in my life.  Second, I don't have an outdoor grill or a grill pan. So, my options are pan frying, broiling, or baking.      The only cooking instructions on the package states "Slow cooking will result in a more tender product."      My biggest concern is that the rib eye steaks are not quite 1/2 an inch thick.  I'm afraid by the time I take 30 seconds to sear the meat on high heat it will already be done!   Plus, the warning on the package makes me think twice about any quick cooking techniques.      These frozen packages of meat were on sale at the grocery store, so that is the only reason I bought them.  If I ruin them, Steve won't be very happy with me.      What is the best approach to cooking these steaks?  (If you respond, please indicate whether you are talking about the 1/2" Rib-eyes or the 1" NY Strip steaks.)      Thanks!

I usually find myself packing something like:      2 apples   1 banana   2 wholegrain crackers      :\ I know it's really not enough to keep me going, and I feel really tired and hungry when I get home from school and often sleep for about 2 hours on the sofa, which cuts down homework time (which means I'm often up until about 11pm just doing homework and don't get much sleep).      It's difficult, though, because everyone else in my family eats meat, so I don't have many options. If you can suggest some tasty (important because I'm quite picky), healthy, vegetarian lunchbox ideas I will be very grateful. (: Nothing with nuts please, nuts are banned in our school because some people have allergies. Oh and preferably something that will keep me going and make sure I'm not so tired and hungry when I get home.      Thanks a bunch. :D

But I would like to show my support for GM technology by purchasing some GM products. I heard  a while ago they were making tomatoes which contain soya protein, as well as introducing transgenes into crops allowing them to grow more efficiently in somewhat unsuitable environments. I know that these will taste identical to GM free products but it's just something I've always wanted to eat, as well as to support an innovative technology which has come under fire recently.      So yes, it's an odd question, but do you know where I can buy food which I know is GM in or near Bristol, UK? If not, how about in Birmingham? Thanks!
