UFteXlqwaa	The common factor is, of course, the temperature. But if differs from the monsoons of India (New Delhi) to the winter storms of Europe.    The latter is mostly due to the cold polar winter. During that time, North Pole is very cold and its high pressure extend further south than during the summer. Consequently, the polar front is all the way down to perhaps the Bay of Biscay. That brings low pressures over Portugal where in the summer, that country is mostly under the influence of the Azores high pressure.    Cork, on the other hand, sees low pressures pretty much any time during the year. That is due to its latitude and the vast Atlantic ocean to its west.    India is, as you know, under the influence of the monsoons. During the summer, when the sun is high and heats the northern part of the country, a very large low pressure is created and maritime air comes from east, south and west. That brings moist air that rises and creates the clouds and rainfall typical for the summer.

EeC30mqJaa	yes, it is accelerating.  this is a basic physics problem.  Acceleration is a change in velocity, whether it is an increase or decrease...a change in velocity is called acceleration.     now, think of it like the second hand on a clock, and simply put an X and Y axis along the bottom and the left hand side of the clock, respectively.    when the second hand is moving from the 3 to the 6, its velocity is decreasing along the Y axis, BUT it is increasing along the X axis.      here is what happens between the 3 to the 9:  X axis acceleration increases until it gets to the 6, then starts to decrease  Y axis acceleration decreases until it gets to the 6, then starts to increase.    the speed is constant, but the acceleration is constantly changing.     good luck!|`|AA11602341	Yes. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time (dV/dt = a). If V = constant, then dV/dt = 0.    But, it is experience an angular acceleration due to the constant changing in direction of the velocity vector.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	??? how can the speed be constant and accelerating? It's either constant or accelerating.|`|TqtzzsHjaa	no, its going at a constant speed.    the question says its going at a constant speed...|`|E6YnQIzNaa	Yes, the ball is accelerating.    Acceleration occurs when an object increases in velocity, or if it changes direction.  If the ball was moving in a straight line with constant speed, there would be no acceleration.  But since it's moving in a circle, even at constant speed, the ball isn't moving in a straight line, so it's accelerating.    Acceleration is equal to the derivative of the velocity vector, meaning if the velocity is changing, there is acceleration.  Since velocity is a vector, this includes change in direction.  Due to motion in a circle, the ball is always trying to change it's direction toward the center of the circle.      Just a little side note, this is called centripetal acceleration, due to an object moving in a circle.    And trust me, this is correct.  I've taken physics before, and this is a physics question.|`|8DAO2QL9aa	the ball is subjected to centrifugal force & is having angular velocity and acceleration too.|`|8Tmcg67iaa	No...it can only gain speed if the ball is rotated faster, otherwise, the ball inside will maintain its momentum until a change in motion to the ball causes it to stop or speed up.

iKpbL2YKaa	'Aerobic' means depending on oxygen or air. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen to produce energy in the form of ATP.  'Anaerobic' means without oxygen or air. Anaerobic respiration consists of less stages than aerobic respiration so it doesn't pass onto the stage which requires oxygen.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	Aerobic respiration is the process that takes place in presence of oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the metabolic process that involves break down of fuel molecules to obtain bio-chemical energy and has oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Fuel molecules commonly used by cells in aerobic respiration are glucose, amino acids and fatty acids.. The process of obtaining energy in aerobic respiration can be represented in the following equation:     Glucose + Oxygen Energy + Carbon dioxide + Water     The aerobic respiration is a high energy yielding process. During the process of aerobic respiration as many as 38 molecules of ATP are produced for every molecule of glucose that is utilized. Thus aerobic respiration process breaks down a single glucose molecule to yield 38 units of the energy storing ATP molecules.     Anaerobic respiration     The term anaerobic means without air and hence anaerobic respiration refers to the special type of respiration, which takes place without oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is the process of oxidation of molecules in the absence of oxygen, which results in production of energy in the form of ATP or adenosine tri-phosphate. Anaerobic respiration is synonymous with fermentation especially when the glycolytic pathway of energy production is functional in a particular cell. The process of anaerobic respiration for production of energy can occur in either of the ways represented below:     Glucose (Broken down to) Energy (ATP) + Ethanol + Carbon dioxide (CO2)     Glucose (Broken down to) Energy (ATP) + Lactic acid     The process of anaerobic respiration is relatively less energy yielding as compared to the aerobic respiration process. During the alcoholic fermentation or the anaerobic respiration (represented in the first equation) two molecules of ATP (energy) are produced. for every molecule of glucose used in the reaction. Similarly for the lactate fermentation (represented in the second equation) 2 molecules of ATP are produced for every molecule of glucose used. Thus anaerobic respiration breaks down one glucose molecule to obtain two units of the energy storing ATP molecule|`|OWwAwcFWaa	aerobic respiration simply means carrying out metabolic activities IN THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN. a perfect example is the cells in our body or the mycobacterium tuberculosis ( the bacteria responsible for causing tuberculosis)    anaerobic respiration is the direct opposite of aerobic respiration; organisms in this category DON'T REQUIRE OXYGEN to perform metabolic activities  eg clostridium tetani

DO1ebm95aa	I don't think there's enough information yet to answer the question.    You are correct that the cold weather might make the fibers and strings more taught, but how taught it is is irrelevant.  If you are talking about perfect materials, you will always bounce back to the same height, no matter how soft or taught your spring or trampoline is.  You'll sink farther down in a soft trampoline, and sink less in a tight trampoline, but both will return you back to the same height--theoretically.    The thing that really makes a difference is friction, and your answer has everything to do with the internal friction of your trampoline system.  You need to find out how temperature affects the internal friction of your materials, and I don't think that's an easy thing to figure out by just thinking about it.  You need to look at air friction, friction of your trampoline springs, your trampoline fabric, and the object that is landing on the trampoline.  A squishy object (like a person) landing on a trampoline will bounce better with a softer trampoline because the harder the shock of the bounce, the more energy is absorbed in shock waves through the body.  That's why people don't bounce well off of steel.  Steel is like a really really taught trampoline--a steel ball bounces off of a steel surface really well.      It depends on so many factors that we don't have information on, and the final answer is based on things that we'd have to test experimentally, rather than theorizing about.|`|gg2aJXoDaa	I disagree on the basis that you're right in your ideas, but not in the conclusion -    Any energy you input into taught strings and fibres will be returned when you bounce upwards - but because the strings are taught they will not stretch as far to catapult you upwards.

First of all, bring the 2 out of the integral, because its just a constant.  You're left with   sin d.  Solve for this with U V sub.    To use U V substituion, split the integral into two parts:  and sin d    Call  as U and sin d as dV.    The derivative of U =   is  dU = 1.  The integral of dV = sin d  is  V = -cos.    Then, by using the formula for U V sub., which is:    U*V -  v*dU    Plug in the corresponding terms.   * -cos -  -cos * 1  This equals [-cos + sin]. Remember to multiply by the two that we took outside of the integral.  -2cos + 2sin    then you can easily input the bounds.  Your final answer is:    -2(pi/2)cos(pi/2) + 2sin(pi/2) + 2(0)cos(0) - 2sin(0) = 0 + 2 + 0 - 0 = 2    Final answer is 2.
Gnfc4wRlaa	Earth's circumference at the Equator is 24,901.55 miles.  If it were possible to walk completely around the Earth (if you could walk on water, for instance) you could walk it in 207.5 days at 5 mph.    The Sun's circumference is 2713406 miles.  If it were possible to walk on the surface of the Sun, you could walk around it in 61.95 years.    Although I didn't find its circumference of Antares, I found that its diameter  is 700 times that of the Sun.  That should mean that the circumference is also 700 times that of the Sun, so 700 x 61.95 = 43,365 years.    So, all your numbers are roughly correct.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	I think the photosphere is defined as a 2/3 optical depth into the star.

Yes, it would take 207 or 208 days to walk around the Earth's equator.  I get 61.9 years for the sun (bring lots of water).    You number for Antares about right, but there's a trick to it.  It's listed as being 700 times bigger than our sun.  But the "surface" is very vague, millions of times less definite than our sun. For our sun, the "surface" is about a few 100 miles thick.  It's like a thin cloud that gets thicker and thicker as you go into it.  For Antares, you would sink at least 1/2 of the way to the core before the plasma got as thick as the sun's surface.      The "surface" of the sun or a star is defined as the point where there is a sharp change in the light emission.  This can happen while the plasma density is very thin.
HEzWkWS7aa	No. mRNA known as messenger RNA uses DNA as a template for mRNA. RNA polymerase II converts DNA into mRNA and thymidine bases are replaces by uridine bases in mRNA. also other enzymes put the 5' cap on the 5' end of the mRNA and a poly A tail is put on the 3' part of the mRNA to protect its stability and guidance to the ribosome where it will be processed into amino acids which make a a primary sequence of the protein.    This does not take into account alternative splicing of mRNA which results in several different protein products from one mRNA.

NaGLfILDaa	This is a pretty simple question, here's how you do it:<br>  <br>  The equation states that 1.000 mol of (N2H4) reacts with 2.000 mol of (H2O2) to produce 1.000 mol of (N2) and 4.000 mol of (H2O).<br>  This means in order for a reaction to take place, there must be twice as many moles of (H2O2) as there are (N2H4). In this case (a.) the limiting reactant is (H2O2) because no more than 0.250 mol of (N2H4) can react with 0.500 mol of (H2O2).<br>  Assuming maximum yield, (b.) there will be 0.500 excess mol of (N2H4) after the reaction and all (H2O2) will have been consumed by the reaction.<br>  Again assuming maximum yield, (c.) there will be 0.250 mol of (N2) and 1.000 mol of (H2O). This is because the number of moles of reactants used is one-fourth of the moles stated in the equation, therefore the products will also be one-fourth of what is stated in the equation.

mZcdC90Uaa	Codominance is a condition in which both alleles for a gene are fully expressed. Incomplete dominace is like when Mendel crossed pea-plants, one allele was completely dominant over the other. In some cases an offspring has a phenotype that is intermediate between the traits of its two parents.<br>  Stefani|`|02sblnZGaa	codominant ....think blood type AB ( both alleles appear and non of them is more dminant than the other.<br>  <br>  Incomplete, cross a homozygous sominant AA with a recessive white aa , you get herozygous Aa .....that is imcomplete, none of them is dominant|`|y3WUxZoDaa	Codominance results when two dominant alleles both show phenotypically, roan cattle appear one color but are a mixture of two colors of fur.  Definition-A phenotypic situation in which both alleles are expressed in the heterozygote<br>  Incomplete dominance is the "blending" of two traits (alleles). If a white flower is crossed with a red flower the result would be all hybrids and all pink flowers, the result of neither allele being completely dominant. That is a hypothetical example.

Kinetic friction reduces speed but static friction can actually increase speed.  Place a block on a sheet of paper and slowly accelerate it so the block doesn't slip.  The block is increasing its speed and the agent responsible is the static friction between the block and the paper.

hNa5oHxQaa	Inorganic|`|EZyHOht7aa	Inorganic. I had a typo|`|XcBPoQSxaa	The traditional definition of "organic", used by chemists, is that a substance is organic if it consists of carbon compounds. "Organic chemistry" is the study of compounds of carbon. <br>  <br>  Most sand you find in deserts consists of silicon dioxide (quartz), and therefore can be classified as "inorganic". <br>  <br>  Many sands on ocean beaches, particularly the very white ones, have big contributions from ground up seashells, corals, and diatoms. Calcium carbonate is a big ingredient in seashells, and so beach sand has carbon compounds in it after all. Cacium carbonate dissolves in water, however (it’s one thing that makes "hard" water hard), although ocean water is already saturated with dissolved calcium carbonate, unable to take any more. There may be other carbon compounds in some sands, like silicon carbide. <br>  <br>  Sand on the beach may have other stuff in it, like little bits of seaweed, driftwood, fish skeletons, shells, and lots of other organic things (many of them still alive!). <br>  <br>  The other very common use of the word "organic" comes from the food biz. A food is called organic if it has been grown without the aid of artifical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. Even if a food doesn’t satisfy these requirements, it probably still contains carbon compounds! Very fine sand may be added to some foods for non-nutritional reasons. I have a jar of paprika powder at home which lists, among its ingredients, "silicon dioxide" (sand), added in order to keep the paprika from caking up in lumps when the humidity goes up. I suppose if the paprika were grown in accordance with organic farming rules, the addition of the sand probably wouldn’t keep the "organic" label off of it.|`|H18QZLIDaa	inorganic.

4fWZL4TRaa	I don't have the direct answer, not being familiar with the arduino programming, but a toggle switch is a momentary switch with a latch (memory of the previous state). In hardware, that can be done by a "D" type flip flop. Each time the clock is toggled by the momentary switch, it changes state. The momentary switch needs to be "debounced" otherwise the "D" type flip flop will also respond to the contact bounce, changing state many times. One of the Arduino languages is "a C like language". The latch can be implemented as a variable, and whenever the momentary action is seen as active, change the logical state of the variable by complementing its current state (x = NOT x). The variable is the output of the switch. The switch still needs debouncing either in hardware or software if the software is quick enough to see contact bounce. Consider the contact bounces last a few ms, and the momentary push maybe 100ms or more, as long as it is held.<br>  <br>  For your case, you don't need the latch. You just need to detect the momentary switch has operated then branch to the program. It doesn't matter about contact bounce, and the software "remembers it is running" and just goes to the end, if it is sequential. If it is rules dependent, like spread-sheet or ladder logic, you will have to figure it out from what I have said, but with ladder logic, all the inputs are read for each step, and then processed and output, then next step, up the ladder and back to the start, to give the illusion of being simultaneous. The ability to have a conditional branch off to your program should be there on the rung (IF input(n) = true THEN run program). This is like a sequential loop checking inputs, processing them, and out-putting, according to rules about the steps on the ladder etc.|`|2zYCQX9saa	I may not have the answer, but I wanted to say thanks! <br>  <br>  I looked up the arduino, and it looks like a lot of fun. If the 'wiring' programs are anything like PLC ladder logic programming, then yes. It is possible to make the input of a real world discrete component give a valid input  and have that signal perform the desired outcome logic.<br>  <br>  If you're simply using hardwires to program the arduino, then the JIC relay logic conventions would easily suffice. (Far cheaper, too)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. It looks to me like I've got another thing to add to my electronics bench!
V4oqAHDqaa	1) Electrostatics. Unlike charges attract each other<br>  <br>  2) Nuclear forces; would take an essay to do the subject justice<br>  <br>  3) Look up "incomplete shielding", or it may be called "partial screening", in your course materials.  Crudely, as you move from left to right across the periodic table, each electron experiences a greater effective nuclear charge, because the electrons don't screen each other perfectly.<br>  <br>  4) Line spectra require quantised energies. Classically, black body radiation should become more intense at shorter wavelength, all the way into the most energetic x-ray region, because there are more ways of fitting a shorter wavelength resonator into a box. Classically, there is no reason why there should be a threshold for the photoelectric effect (this is what Einstein actually got his Nobel prize for).<br>  <br>  With these clues, choose one to write about, read up your course materials, and do your own writing.

Gmvldblraa	All the EM waves are vibrating electric and magnetic fields - we can't see them - we see with them. And the act of seeing them, converts them into something else.<br>  <br>  I imagine myself with my eyes at the water level of some vast pond. Away in the distance a stone is dropped in and the ripples radiate out - transverse waves, driven up and down by gravity and spread sideways by surface tension. If they are waves of light, then you don't see anything until the ripples arrive at your eye and rise up and down against your eyeball. there is no more ripple in that direction; your head has soaked up its energy but you know that the wave arrived.<br>  <br>  For visible light we were told to imagine a thread about 30 cms long, flying along,(like a very thin swimming eel) wriggling violently, up and down, but also spinning, rotating around the long central axis.<br>  Any use?

FT5QFWW4aa	For the most part the treatment just includes a low protein diet. In people who have PKU their bodies do not break down the amino acid Phenylalanine which is found in protein. Because they cannot break this amino acid down they must follow a low phenylalanine diet which is usually called a low protein diet.<br>  <br>  The diet excludes meat, dairy, beans, nuts, and most grain products. Those who have PKU usually eat fruits, vegetables, starchy foods in measured amounts, and specially made low protein foods. The low protein foods include breads, pastas, baked goods, imitations of things such as hamburgers or hotdogs. These foods are specially made so that they do not contain as much protein as the normal food would.<br>  <br>  Because people born with PKU cannot eat various foods they must also drink a special metabolic formula (or a drink mix). This formula not only provides them with many vitamins and nutrients they need it also provides them with the amino acid Tyrosine. Tyrosine is the amino acid that most peoples bodies turn Phenylalanine into. Tyrosine is needed for propper growth and development and because those who have PKU cannot create Tyrosine they must drink special metabolic amino acid drinks for life to get the Tyrosine that they need.<br>  <br>  Those who have PKU have to also do regular blood tests. The blood tests monitor how much Phenylalanine is in the blood. The ideal range is 2-6 milligrams of Phenylalanine per each decaliter of blood. <br>  <br>  If someone born with PKU follows their diet for life they can expect to live a completely normal, happy, and healthy life. The life expectancy is the same as everyone else.|`|8V2KIPw3aa	As far as I know, the treatment is usually just dietary--low phenyalanine and high tyrosine (both are amino acids).  Most people with the condition, if detected early and managed appropriately, live just as long as those who don't have the diease.  The drug Kuvan can be used in addition to the diet.  <br>  <br>  In women who have PKU it becomes very important to maintain low levels if phenyalanine during pregnancy.  Phenylalanine can cross the placenta and cause birth defects.  This can be avoided if the diet is continued before and during pregnancy.

mJEwEuyxaa	Alright, so if you multiply any number by 2, and add one, that number will be odd..no matter what.  So use that to solve the first one.

The density of pure water at 4°C and 1.0 atmosphere pressure is 1.0 gram per millilitre. (1.0g/mL)<br>  (1.0mL is also called a cubic centimetre ('cc').<br>  So, 42.2g x 1g/mL = 42.2mL (or cc) of water.<br>  <br>  The above is not a 'trick' its a known fact.<br>  If you know the Density (or Specific Gravity) of a different liquid (or a solid), simply compare it to water by multiplying the density of water by the SG of the other substance.(Specific Gravity is the Density without the units).<br>  Density of water = 1.0g/mL the SG therefore is 1.0 (no units)).<br>  <br>  Example. The specific gravity of Mercury is 13.6.<br>  Water Density is 1g/mL. <br>  1.0g/mL x 13.6 = 13.6g/mL Density of mercury or, 1.0cc of mercury = 13.6g.<br>  1.0 litre of mercury therefore will have a mass of 13.6 x 1,000g/L = 13,600g (13.6kg).|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	The key is knowing that the density of water is 1.0000 g/mL.  Therefore, every gram of water has a volume of one mL, and every mL of water has a mass of one gram.  So the mass of 42.2 grams of water must be . . . 42.2 mL.  As long as it is water you're dealing with, you just end up basically switching the units.<br>  <br>  Please note that this "trick" will NOT work with anything which has a density which is higher or lower than that of liquid water.

b8yhcxmRaa	Plastic bags litter the landscape. Once they are used, most plastic bags go into landfill, or rubbish tips. Each year more and more plastic bags are ending up littering the environment. Once they become litter, plastic bags find their way into our waterways, parks, beaches, and streets. And, if they are burned, they infuse the air with toxic fumes. <br>  <br>  Plastic bags kill animals. About 100,000 animals such as dolphins, turtles whales, penguins are killed every year due to plastic bags. Many animals ingest plastic bags, mistaking them for food, and therefore die. And worse, the ingested plastic bag remains intact even after the death and decomposition of the animal. Thus, it lies around in the landscape where another victim may ingest it. <br>  <br>  Plastic bags are non-biodegradable. And one of the worst environmental effects of plastic bags is that they are non-biodegradable. The decomposition of plastic bags takes about 1000 years. <br>  <br>  Petroleum is required to produce plastic bags. As it is, petroleum products are diminishing and getting more expensive by the day, since we have been using this non-renewable resource increasingly. Petroleum is vital for our modern way of life. It is necessary for our energy requirements – for our factories, transport, heating, lighting, and so on. Without viable alternative sources of energy yet on the horizon, if the supply of petroleum were to be turned off, it would lead to practically the whole world grinding to a halt. Surely, this precious resource should not be wasted on producing plastic bags, should it?
ebfe21e4693a7038f59529f6ba61a937aa	Evolution is best explained by the passing on of traits between generations of organisms that enhance the survival of the organisms. This leads to a greater proportion of those traits being inherited by later generations. <br>  For bioluminescence, it is formed by a protein that emits light (an example is Green Fluorescent Protein, from jellyfish but often used in recombinant DNA experiments in the lab). Since proteins are formed by organisms based on the code of DNA, GFP is simply the result of DNA that mutated until a light-forming protein was formed. The organisms with this protein had a selective advantage: they could attract mates that preferred the green light and therefore reproduce, and pass on their GFP genes to further generations.

Why?  Because you know that the coal bed must be thick enough to crop out at the low point and the high point. And because this is on the same strike line, there should be no gaps in between, and it must be the same bed.<br>  <br>  In your case, you are drawing the outcrop - so your coal will probably not crop out at multiple levels along the same structure contour.  Your "maximum" thickness would be the contour interval of the map, in this case.   (If you do any map exercises where all the units are drawn in, those may crop out in varying thicknesses, in which case you would need to follow the directions given above.)<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.

pDUuZAnGaa	You need to look at the concept behind the formula. Please don't listen to people saying that gravity is increasing the force or any of these other crazy explanations.<br>  <br>  Work = Force X Distance<br>  <br>  An important point here is that whether you use an inclined plane to lift an object up or not, the same amount of work is being done because in both cases you are doing work against gravity.<br>  <br>  If we look at the work done by gravity we can use the equation for gravitational potential energy:<br>  <br>  U = mg*h<br>  <br>  Take a second to see how this is the same as work, where mg is the force, and the height the object is being lifted is the distance.<br>  <br>  So, we can set the work done by you equal to the work done by gravity.<br>  <br>  W (you) = W (gravity)<br>  <br>  F x d = mg x h<br>  <br>  An inclined plane is really just a simple machine. By increasing the distance, since work remains constant, the amount of force applied is thus decreased. In the equation, we see force and distance are inversely related. Increase one, the other one must decrease.<br>  <br>  So, Work = same, Force = decreased, Distance = increased.<br>  <br>  The extra distance you have to push an object up the inclined plane is the price being payed for the decreased amount of force you must use, yet work never changes!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	The force of gravity pulling it down increases the overall force of the object. :)|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	It allows gravity to add more force to the moving object from the weight in a concentrated area.|`|B3HsDsIXaa	When you push something on an inclined plane, gravity works with or against the force already being put on the object, making the work, which is basically how far you move it, increase or decrease.|`|OoYldnAsaa	Same amount of work done in a shorter period of time.

4fWZL4TRaa	Yes both of these work in some way. Seems more likely they have a field winding. You will need to understand how to make them self exciting by connecting the field in parallel, or maybe a controller that connects the field when there are enough RPM. The field may be a different voltage, like 70V.<br>  <br>  With 174V at 3000 RPM, you can expect 17.4V at 300 RPM etc, so these could most likely charge a 24V battery directly. A bit large, but better than most people get hold of. You will see that a 12 V car battery is good for less than 200W, so you need big batteries and more volts than 12V.<br>  <br>  Using DC motors with batteries may not be the best path to take. However you could connect the DC output to a grid connect inverter. It would need the proper voltage range, which will depend on RPM. May need step up gears.<br>  <br>  This motor is able to deliver useful amounts of power if the RPM is sufficient and the turbine is big enough. The field will use some of the power generated.<br>  <br>  No point doing this if you don't have the space, permits and wind you need. It probably takes 18km/h to get significant power from a wind turbine, and nothing at all below 11km/h.|`|FDLON8QTaa	In general, DC motors can be utilized as generators if an external source (i.e. wind or water) rotate the shaft.  For instance, if wind spins the motor, it will actually act as a generator and produce electrical current that can be "harnessed" at the motor leads.<br>  <br>  To answer your question specifically, more information about your particular motors is needed.  Check the motor nameplate for more data.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the voltages you listed are somewhat peculiar.  In order to use the derived wind power for some useful function you may need to get a buck-boost transformer and you will defiently need to get an inverter.|`|pInY6rYqaa	I think so.<br>  <br>  To get that amount of power you will need to match shaft RPM with a blade of the right diameter and efficiency for the wind speed at which you want maximum power.<br>  <br>  There's lots of variables in such a project and you'll only get maximum power under one set of circumstances . <br>  <br>  Google "Wind turbines."

lKXLaJ0Taa	People on coronary bypass are alive but under anesthesia.  If they were taken off anesthesia, they would be conscious as long as the cerebral perfusion was adequate.  But they might be a little freaked out with all these tubes sticking out of their chest.  They obviously couldn't ;live like that for long because bacteria would shortly colonize their chest cavity and they would develop infections.  This is why any intrathoracic surgery should only be attempted in a sterile situation in an operating room designed for that.  Although cadiopulmonary bypass permits perfusion of the brain and other vital organs, this is not a state that someone could live in long term.  This is why terher are heart transplants, artificial hearts, etc.   But as long as the brain perfusion pressure doesn't drop below a certain level (50 mm Hg) for a significant period of time, the person will not be a vegetable.|`|AA11432707	We don't keep unanesthetized patients on CPB.

5Xp59a3Iaa	I'm going to answer this in practical but simple thought.<br>  <br>  There are many solar systems per galaxy. And we discover more galaxies all the time. We do not yet know how far our universe spans. The reason -we- have life/civilization is because we are at a good location in terms of how far we are from the sun to have the right circumstances for such life.<br>  <br>  Now, put this together. Of ALL the other galaxies there could potentially be in the universe, what are the odds that not even ONE other one has the fitting circumstances for life too? It's a very plausible idea. The question is, how advanced may they be and how are they progressing compared to us? Who will discover who first?<br>  <br>  And additionally, give this a thought. Think of how far the human race has evolved and how much more advanced we are than other species of animals. Say we didn't have, i don't know, cats. Say you have never seen one before. And you went to another planet and it was inhabited by cats. True it is an animal race, and true it is life, but could you ever see a "cat" evolving into a being of high enough awareness to ponder if there is another planet full of other beings? My science teacher put it to us this way once and we all laughed. But for all we know life out there may not be as evolved as ours and we may have to be the ones to make contact first. And when we do and these creatures are more "animal" than intelligent, how will we regard them?<br>  <br>  But, then there is the scarier alternative, in my opinion. A planet of beings that are just as intelligent, or maybe more so and how advanced they could potentially be. We already know that on different local planets, that while there isn't life, there are different minerals and gases that make up them. Here on our own planet we have used the minerals and gases to make synthetic materials that have advanced us. If a planet with a race of intelligent creatures have different minerals (which its likely they would, because the odds of an EXACT replica of earth may not be just that good) to work with, what synthetic materials could they potentially create? And would those things bring about our destruction? They could have things we do not have here and would not know how to defend ourselves against because we are unfamiliar with them, and therefore the lesser of intelligent beings in this situation.<br>  <br>  All good questions, stemming from your question.<br>  But sadly, no straight answers because we just can't give one right now.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	As Kevin McCarthy said in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "THEY'RE HERE!  YOU'RE NEXT!"|`|xDPQ700baa	Would be nice wouldn't it? Personally I think it can happen. That is not to say it will but it will be long distance not in person. That is some method for transmissions to be aimed at a source and received from that. Given the distances it will be a very long time between each transmission and reply. Then there is also the chances of us and them happening on each other in this way which unfortunately increases the odds of it happening.|`|DBvjwPTcaa	Spot on, but we have to keep trying, 100, 1,000, 10,000 years on. We can't just give up, its for our decendents sake. Even travelling at the speed of light is not sufficient. <br>  <br>  We have to develop technology that can propel us at a speed of 1000 times that of light to consider it to be like a common flight half way around the globe. We have a 100 million years to develop this technology before the earth gets really warm due to the expanding sun. Probably in a thousand years, we have colonize Mars and Jupiter's moon. By then we may have picked up some alien tele signals and probably able to see their planet through a much powerful telescope. Physical contact may follow later on.<br>  <br>  Don't think they will look anything like us.|`|luYtFLSUaa	I hope you are wrong. We do have, on paper, spacecraft that could cruise near light speed, and we have one, by god, that may be able to travel faster than light. Of course, we don't really have what it takes to build such things and may not for many centuries.  Still, if we can think of such things, any spacefaring aliens out there have probably already thought of them and improved upon them and made them and their even better modified versions. Its also possible, that they might think of things we have never thought of.  <br>  <br>  You must keep one thing in mind: travel at or faster than light speed is impossible in the universe as we know it, but we may be able to locally modify the universe to permit FTL speeds<br>  <br>  If not, I expect them to visit us one day. Don't look for them too soon - their ultrahigh energy tecnolgies would be so much magic to us savages. We might be shocked silly and scared to death|`|OffM2Ndiaa	yes theoretically there could be an identical civilization in a galaxy right next to ours|`|Qe3vmIdSaa	I think your opinion assumes contact specifies direct contact. How about radio contact? Radio waves can be sent unfathomable distances. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I do not think we will make contact with other beings. I believe if there is life out there, it is in a form like micro-organisms which have no desire to travel out into space or to search for other life.<br>  <br>  But yes, the fact that space itself is incomprehensible in size doesn't help things either|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	Space is huge, possibly infinite, but it's also possible that one or both of our races could find a way to achieve dimensional travel (across the third dimension) and reach another galaxy. It's just an opinion though. Traveling through the third dimension, or teleportation, may very well be impossible. It's open to discussion. <br>  <br>  If we do meet an alien race though I hope they're friendly, and I hope we're friendly. You know how humans are with thinking they're superior to everything, a fight's almost inevitable unless they're much less advanced but we might just end up enslaving them. Or them us, who knows.|`|dZKiXbhRaa	Wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  That is simply our idea based off what we 'think' we know. We are very very very young...we've been trying to figure out space flight for not even 100 years..so..hahaah..it's laughable.<br>  <br>  Here's the truth.<br>  <br>  We have been contacted and we have contacted alien race(s)..we have detailed lengthy documentation of of over 30 races. We 'know of' hundreds. We also have agreements in place between specific races and they do not travel by means of 'go really fuckn fast'..that's just stupid **** we think up because we are still dumb.<br>  <br>  So.<br>  <br>  That IS the truth..I could go on for days and days with this.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Visual perception is the ability to interpret information from visible light reaching the eye. The resulting perception is also known as eyesight, sight or vision. The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and molecular biology.<br>  <br>  The visual system in humans allows individuals to assimilate information from the environment. The act of seeing starts when the lens of the eye focuses an image of its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina is actually part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer for the conversion of patterns of light into neuronal signals. The lens of the eye focuses light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed in a hierarchical fashion by different parts of the brain, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain.<br>  <br>  Reading (process) is the human cognitive process of decoding symbols or syntax for the purpose of deriving meaning (reading comprehension) or constructing meaning. (pronounced "reeding").

bKfAte8aaa	When you breathe in oxygen, this goes into your lungs (respiratory) and is also circulated into your blood (circulatory) which is brought to all the cells in your body. The reason WHY we need oxygen is because oxygen is the  'FINAL ELECTRON ACCEPTOR" (mark me- that will be on your test) and thus is able to complete cellular respiration for ATP (the energy your cells need to do everyday things).|`|2C1C3Zfyaa	Because when you breath in, your lungs fill with air and the tissues in your lungs absorb the oxygen to be put in your blood cells.

2lQ8DJAcaa	transpiration - It is a process in which the plants evaporate water. This transpiration process is on the leaves when stomata are open during the passing of CO2 and O2 and that process is called photosynthesis.<br>  Talking about the factors which affect the transpiration function they are mostly the environmental factors. This includes light, temperature, humidity, and wind and soil water.<br>  Plants transpire in light in more rate than in the dark. This is a legal factor because in the light the stimulation of opening of the stomata is large than in the dark. Due to light the temperature of the leave is more it warming the leaf so that's why it speeds up the process.<br>  Then temperature and the rate of the temperature also affect a lot to the rate of transpiration. They transpire more rapidly when the temperature is high because at high temperature water evaporates more rapidly.<br>  Now humidity also affects a lot because when the surrounding air is dry, diffusion of water out of the leaf goes on more humidity. The rate of diffusion of any substance increase or decrease due to the difference in absorption of the substance may increase or decrease.<br>  In what condition the leaf becomes increasingly humid? The answer is when there is no air or wind in its surroundings. When there is humid air in its surrounding it is carried away and replaced by drier air.<br>  <br>  diffusion - Diffusion is one of the fundamental processes by which material moves. It is thus important in biology and medicine, chemistry and geology, engineering and physics, and in just about every aspect of our lives. Diffusion is a consequence of the constant thermal motion of atoms, molecules, and particles, and results in material moving from areas of high to low concentration. Thus the end result of diffusion would be a constant concentration, throughout space, of each of the components in the environment.

He2WsvBcaa	They are both covalent; specifically they are polar covalent.<br>  <br>  Dextrose, also known as glucose, has a chemical formula of C6H12O6 and as you can see, all three elements bonded are nonmetals so you can automatically surmise that this compound is covalent. If you have a reference table (which you should have), you can look up the electronegativity values of the elements and tell the differences between the atoms in the compound. If the electronegativity difference between atoms is 1.7 or higher then it is ionic. Now do the math, figure out the electronegativity difference between C and H and the difference between H and O.<br>  <br>  Sucrose has a chemical formula of C12H22O11 so do the same thing as with dextrose and determine the electronegativity differences.

As for dominant and recessive, well brown hair is dominant and red hair is recessive. I'm not sure how to answer your question unless you want a punnet square. And as for purebred and hybrid, lets put it this way. You have two ears of corn and they are both yellow then if your cross breed them their offspring will be yellow which would be purebred. Okay then lets take yellow corn and cross breed it with purple corn. Well their offspring would be both purple and yellow. so the corn would looked speckled. This would be a hybrid.

NbdTgyLPaa	This is difficult to answer without knowing more about what you know and what resources you have.<br>  <br>  But some things you should do no matter what are to use several different test subjects and to take several different measurements for each subject.  Test subjects should be chosen randomly (if possible).  The test subject not be able to see you, or the person who is starting the test, as they may pick up clues from watching your body language which would interfere with a pure measurement of reaction from the start of the stimulus.  And as a side though, you might also want to consider trying different types of music as well.<br>  <br>  Suggestion 1) I'd say a simple but pretty good experiment would be one where you have an electronic timer that starts when you do something like shine a light on the wall, and stops when the subject presses a button.  The key point here, however you actually start and stop it, is that it's automatically done and in conjunction with an electronic timer.  This reduces the potential sources of error as well as increases the precision of your results.<br>  <br>  Suggestion 2) If you don't have that sort of equipment for the first suggestion, then I'd suggest a very simple experiment.  Hold a ruler (if possible, hold it with a mechanical devise so the test subject can't see you) such that bottom end dangles between the subjects fingers.  Release the ruler unexpectedly and measure reaction time based on where the subject grasps the ruler as it falls between his or her fingers.  Basic physics lets you calculate this, t = sqrt(2as), or the time is the square root of the product of twice the acceleration due to gravity times the distance measured on the ruler.  The "a" of gravitational acceleration is approximately 980.665 cm/s or 386.0886 in/s.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

eCjx7kLAaa	I highly recommend contacting the departments of the schools you intend to apply to, as the requirements can vary widely.  It's not unusual for people with Bachelor's in science fields to get grad degrees in engineering, but it may require you to take some extra classes to catch up with classmates coming into grad school with engineering degrees.  Being in the similar fields you may not see too much of this problem, but you'd need to check with each school.  Having a science background puts you in a good position to enter engineering, because it is science based.<br>  <br>  As to the PhD, that entirely depends on the school.  Some schools consider an M.Eng parallel to a PhD, and won't let you get both in the same field without special consideration.  However, if you get an M.Eng in Env Eng, and then try for a PhD in Env Sci, you may find that the M.Eng doesn't count at all towards the PhD because of being a different field.  Again, it's all up to the department on what they will and won't accept.

These combine to produce a total weight of  3334 N - as you can see, its not really worth bothering about the gravity bit, but if the questioner is being tricky then they might think it important.<br>  <br>  Take your pick - either 3325 N  or 3334 N is the kids weight<br>  <br>  c) We shouldn't really do this conversion - pounds are a unit of mass, not force, but because we are familiar with the effect of gravity on pound lumps.....<br>  <br>  3334/4.45 = 749 lb.  <br>  <br>  Very few , if any,  of us could hold 749 lb with one arm.

However, this energy is not something that we can easily extract, I don't think that's really what you want to know.<br>  <br>  U-235 produces energy when it undergoes fission, and I think that is what you meant to ask about.  Per Wikipedia, "The fission of one atom of U-235 generates 202.5 MeV = 3.244 × 10?11 J."<br>  <br>  The way this sort of thing is calculated does again use E=mc^2, but for fission you basically find the amount of mass that was converted to energy (instead of using the full mass of the atom).  The amount of mass converted to energy is equal to the mass of the original U-235 atoms minus the mass of its final daughter products.<br>  <br>  Note that the reason some atoms, such as U-235 produce energy during fission is because the resulting daughter products have less mass than the original atom.  This mostly holds true for atoms with a large number of protons.<br>  <br>  Similarly, fusion produces energy is lighter atoms, as the mass of the products is less than the mass of atoms that were combined.  This is typically true for atoms with a small number of protons.<br>  <br>  Atoms in the middle of our know periodic table will not normally produce energy by either fission or fusion.  They generally require energy for this to occur.

Still underground, the alpha particles find electrons and join up with them to become helium atoms. It is captured in large tanks- almost like filling up a water tank from a spring.
cKzfxE0Zaa	I don't think that a spectroscopic binary needs to be unresolvable optically. It only does need to be resolvable spectroscopically, by the way spectral features in one or both stars change their observed frequency. So I would have picked "b" also.<br>  <br>  The only binary that is not a spectroscopic binary is the one that you are looking at from the direction of (or opposite to) the orbital angular momentum vector.<br>  <br>  Saying that a visually resolvable binary can't be a spectroscopic binary is like saying that since a star is a Cepheid variable, you may not use parallax in measuring its distance, even if it is close enough to Earth for parallax to be used.<br>  <br>  And although an eclipsing binary might "constantly show" a doppler shift, it does NOT show a "constant doppler shift." The dopper shift changes because the star's radial speed with respect to Earth changes as the stars orbit each other.<br>  <br>  All eclipsing binaries are spectroscopic binaries because none of them is being observed from the direction of (or opposite to) the orbital angular momentum vector.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	none of the above. i can think of counterexamples to all of the options.|`|4FFJNNjnaa	'Spectroscopic' just means so close and distant that we can't resolve the components.  So, a is out...could be any luminousity.  b is out, since some are resolvable. c is out, since any 'types' can be var., and e is out since equal mass is I think pretty rare, un equal is more likely...<br>  <br>  So, d in in.  an eclipsing binary , spectroscopic or not, will always show shift.  Except when viewed from above or below, which is unlikely but not impossible.  So d is sorta in and out.  More in than out, I'd say.

xpyQZba7aa	Convert your reagents to moles.... always do this<br>  You need to determine the limiting reagent first. Because the amount of each product depends on the limiting reagent.<br>  <br>  The limiting reagent is the reagent that will be all used up if the reaction goes to completion. There is not enough of it to react all of the other reagent. It is called the limiting reagent because once it is all gone there can be no more product formed even though there is some of the other reagent left.<br>  <br>  Then use the moles of limiting reagent to determine the moles of product produced.<br>  <br>  moles = mass / molar mass<br>  molar mass NH3 = 17.03 g/mol<br>  molar mass O2 = 32.00 g/mol<br>  <br>  moles NH3 = 40.0 g / 17.03 g/mol <br>  = 2.35 mol NH3<br>  <br>  moles O2 = 50.0 g / 32.00 g/mol<br>  = 1.56 mol O2<br>  <br>  Now, The balanced equation tells you that<br>  4 mol NH3 reacts with 5 mol O2<br>  So <br>  1 mol NH3 reacts with 5/4 moles O2<br>  and 2.35 mol NH3 reacts with (5/4 x 2.35) moles O2<br>  = 2.94 moles O2<br>  <br>  2.35 mol NH3 needs to have 2.94 moles of O2 in order to react fully<br>  <br>  You only have 1.56 mol O2, which is not enough. Therefore O2 is the limiting reagent and NH3 is in excess.<br>  <br>  The maximum amount of product you can form is from the complete reaction of all of your limiting reagent (1.56 mol O2)<br>  <br>  The equation tells you that <br>  5 mol O2 reacts to form 6 mols of H2O<br>  Thus 1 mol O2 ----------> 6/5 mol H2O<br>  And 1.56 mol O2 -------> (6/5 x 1.56) mol H2O<br>  = 1.87 mol H2O<br>  <br>  = c.

02sblnZGaa	Histidine is a basic amino acid and does have polar side chains so it could form zwitterion stucture, which contains a polar and non polar side chain. Tryptophan is a non polar aromatic amino acid, and doesnt easily accepts proton as well as histidine does since its non basic. Because of its non polar ability, it doesn't ionize as well.|`|PkGROcYqaa	You need to look at the chemical structures of each amino acid H and W. Look for the most stable resonance intermediate.<br>  With H, the double bond can resonate between the 2 nitrogens. But with W, resonace is possible, but destabilize aromatice ring by putting a + charge inside the ring. The N can be stabilized, but the overall ring structure is destabilized, which implies that the stabilized N will be short term.<br>  So when H and W resonate, the most stable resonace structure will prevail. This means that N will be more stabilized (in either resonance state) for H, than for W.<br>  good luck.

Programming is probably your best bet though since it can easily be done from home.<br>  <br>  You also must consider, that<br>  <br>  a) You may not have continuous work.  Engineers get laid off often.  And the type of work you are looking for might not always be there.<br>  <br>  b) Taking care of a child is a job in itself.

Some of the perspectives you could expect are pragmatic, analytical, critical, practical, project and team oriented. It is a career, you put in a lot of effort at uni, then hope that will pay off as you gain experience and go through life. The learning is continual, as the disciplines are not static, and are so broad there is always something else.<br>  <br>  I would expect that if you are truly engineering oriented you will already have done a few little projects of your own. Engineers are more likely to be employed by corporations and government. The role is to design, develop, supervise construction, take responsibility, define hazards, maintenance procedures, operational procedures for whatever the discipline is, be it electrical power, electronic systems, bridges, railways, aircraft, buildings, engines, machines. The tools are computers, reference books, physics, mathematics, and all sorts of science depending on the specifics.<br>  <br>  Other than professional engineers there are technical and trades which might give you plenty of the interests you have, and provide more but lesser opportunities, unless you go into a contracting business or some such. Hard to predict these things, but ready willing and able are the keys.<br>  <br>  The programming/web design etc is something like a computer engineer, which is related to an electronic engineer. It is connecting computers with the real world, the accent being on computer systems. That could be more compatible with working from home. I think there will be a greater trend for working from home as there is some social benefit, and an environmental benefit.|`|AA11337952	For other jobs you might like, a computer or electrical engineer would sort-of combine both of your passions. If you're looking for a stay-at-home job, you could probably be a computer-science major, and then be a sort of stay-at-home computer consultant. If you're going in to engineering, staying at home probably won't be a very easy possibility however.<br>  <br>  For scholarships, there are a lot of scholarship opportunities that you can find through online sources.

They tend to be 40 to 60 hour per week jobs in which there are fairly high expectations of you.  Depending on what sort of engineer you become, you might be helping to design products, or processes, manage production, or possibly teaching in some form.  <br>  <br>  When you indicate computers as a possible career, there are also many levels.  At some engineering levels, you might be designing them or their components.  Perhaps you will be writing programs for them (sometimes a stay at home job).  Moving down the ladder a bit comes web page design, network management, and even keypuncher.  <br>  <br>  There is no free ride into engineering just because you are female.  You will have to pay to go, though there are scholoarships, loans, and grants available.  You will also have to work hard at it.  It is not a degree for the faint of heart nor for the weak of mind.  It can be a very rewarding career. <br>  <br>  Your best bet at this point is to look at the various engineering societies (IEEE, ACM, AICHE, ASME, etc) and learn what each type of engineer does.<br>  <br>  If engineering isn't quite for you, then look at the various computer courses available.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps the best advice I can give is for you to look at something that is fun to do, and do it well.  As you grow up in that field, you can branch out to more and better opportunities.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to go through a 4 year degree, you may find that the opportunities change a bit.  Instead of website design, you might be working on the back end programming of the databases, security systems, analyzing systems, etc.  The web page designer might not even realize such jobs exist.<br>  <br>  Good luck
rcFmURhEaa	Yes, it does have to do with heterotrophs and autotrophs, read the following:<br>  <br>  Living organisms require organic compounds for food. Organic refers to molecules that contain carbon and hydrogen. Examples of organic nutrients are carbohydrates (sugars, starches), lipids, and proteins.<br>  <br>  Autotrophs are organisms that make their own organic food. Heterotrophs consume food that is already present in the environment. For example, plants are autotrophs because they make their own food by photosynthesis. Animals are heterotrophs because they obtain their food by eating it.<br>  <br>  Autotrophic Prokaryotes<br>  There are two kinds of Autotrophic prokaryotes. Those that make organic food using energy from sunlight are photosynthetic. Autotrophs that make organic food using energy from inorganic chemicals are chemosynthetic.<br>  <br>  Photosynthetic Prokaryotes<br>  The first photosynthetic prokaryotes to evolve did not produce oxygen.<br>  <br>  Cyanobacteria evolved later with the same kinds of chlorophyll found in plants. During photosynthesis, water (H2O) molecules are split and O2 molecules are released. The balanced equation is below.<br>  <br>  Energy + CO2 (carbon dioxide) + H2O becomes C6H12O6 (glucose) + O2<br>  <br>  The green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria do not split water during photosynthesis. Instead, they split H2S; oxygen is therefore not released.<br>  <br>  Photosynthetic prokaryotes have extensions of the plasma membrane called thylakoids. Many of the molecules needed in the reactions of photosynthesis are found within the thylakoid membrane.<br>  <br>  Chemosynthetic Prokaryotes<br>  Chemosynthetic prokaryotes obtain energy to make their organic food by oxidizing high-energy inorganic compounds (hydrogen gas, ammonia, nitrites, and sulfides) instead of consuming organic nutrients or using sunlight.<br>  <br>  Many chemosynthetic prokaryotes are anaerobic; they are often found deep in the sediments of lakes and swamps.<br>  <br>  Chemosynthetic prokaryotes form the basis of the food chain for some communities 2.5 km beneath the sea. Energy for these communities comes from hydrothermal (volcanic) vents. The hot water pouring out of these vents contains high concentrations of inorganic minerals such as sulfides that can be used as an energy source by the prokaryotes..<br>  <br>  Heterotrophic Prokaryotes<br>  Heterotrophic prokaryotes feed on organic matter by secreting enzymes and absorbing the digested material.<br>  <br>  Most heterotrophic prokaryotes are aerobic.<br>  <br>  Feeding<br>  Three types of heterotrophs are described below. Each category is determined by the feeding mode.<br>  <br>  Saprotrophic organisms are decomposers. They play a critical role in recycling (releasing) nutrients that are tied up in the bodies of dead organisms. Most heterotrophic prokaryotes fall into this category.<br>  <br>  Parasites are organisms that live in close association with another species and one species benefits at the expense of the other. Usually, the smaller species resides within a larger species and derives its food from the larger organism. Normally, the larger organism is not killed.<br>  <br>  Mutualistic organisms are those that live in close association with another species and both species benefit as a result of the association.

TMB4d3FAaa	Wild honey is perfectly safe to eat as it is. Humans have been doing it for thousands of years.  No need to process it.  If you wish to extract it, smash it up and strain it through a loose knit cloth like cheese cloth..Don't heat it it above 100F. It will begin losing some of its benefits.  Call a beekeeper from the county extension list.  Explain you want to keep the honey for yourself.  The beekeeper will have all summer (in the Northern hemisphere) to get a new cache of honey from the bees. He'll need enough of yours to keep the swarm going until the first nectar flow. The honey from your wild bees will have no medication etc.  It can be used on burns, cuts etc. It's better then Aloes vera.  The Beekeeper can save the babies that are in the combs now.  Bees are struggling to survive.  You should be able to bargain with the beekeeper pretty well.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A bay is an area of water bordered by land on three sides. It also usually has calm waters.<br>  <br>  A large bay may be called a gulf, cove, sound or bight. A narrow bay may also be called a fjord if its sides are relatively steep. Most of the small bays are formed as soft rock or clay are eroded by waves. Any hard rock is eroded less quickly, leaving headlands. Any bay may contain fish and other sea creatures or be adjacent to other bays.  Large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and the Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology.<br>  <br>  The primary benefit of bays to humans is that they are good locations for human settlement, because of their relative serenity compared to most coastland.  Furthermore, bays tend to be excellent habitats for seafood, such as lobsters, clams, shrimp, and fish.  The most useful commercial function of bays is probably as fisheries.  In addition, they are peaceful locations for boating, especially sailing, and serve as excellent recreational sites for beach-combing, swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving, waterskiing, parasailing, and surfing.

AA11852174	Well, Boyle's Law represents the inversely proportional relationship of pressure and volume. We can use this equation to show Boyle's Law:<br>  <br>  P1V1=P2V2<br>  <br>  So by that, you can predict the pressure of a gas when the volume is given and there is a constant temperature. It would also work when the pressure is given and the volume is being asked.<br>  <br>  It also applies to our daily lives as quoted here from WikiAnswers:<br>  <br>  "A more life dependent example of Boyles Law is the ction of the diaphragm of our body. This is a muscle that is located just below the lungs. When we inhale the diaphragm moves downward allowing the lungs an increased volume. This decreases the pressure inside the lungs so that the pressure is less than the outer pressure. This results in forcing air into the lungs. When we exhale the diaphragm moves upward and decreases the volume of the lungs. This increases the pressure inside the lungs above the pressure on the outside of the lungs so that gases are forced out of the lungs. Of course, all of this is totally automatic and we take this important cycle which is performed hundreds of times a day for granted until we receive a sharp blow to that region that briefly paralyzes the diaphragm muscle. We say the wind was knocked out of us, but Boyles Law was not allowed to function."|`|2qlTrF7Yaa	Boyle's law says that the initial pressure times the initial volume is equal to the resulting pressure times the resulting volume. (P1V1=P2V2)<br>  The assumption is that temperature is not changing. <br>  P1V1=P2V2... If you want to plug in numbers, P1=10 kPa, V1 = 2 mL, P2 = 5 kPa. Solve the variable and V2 = 4 mL.<br>  You can solve for initial/ending pressure or initial/ending volume.<br>  Before you squeeze a balloon, the gas molecules are moving around, bumping into each other/the sides of the balloon. When you squeeze the balloon, you decrease volume. According to Boyle's law, when volume goes down, pressure goes up.<br>  <br>  If you need any clarification, don't hesitate to ask~ Good luck~|`|283297b412ec842727016138d72f017aaa	- Boyle's law describes the pressure-volume relationship when considering gases. It describes the fact that when a gas is forced into a smaller volume, the pressure of the gas will increase because its molecules collide more frequently. A larger volume means the molecules can be further apart (low pressure). <br>  <br>  Boyle discovered that the pressure of a gas times the volume of the container it is kept in should always equal a constant value if certain conditions are observed, including<br>  <br>  - Constant temperature must be maintained, and the gas must be an "ideal gas"<br>  <br>  "  * An Ideal Gas is modelled on the Kinetic Theory of Gases which has 4 basic postulates: <br>  <br>     1. Gases consist of small particles (molecules) which are in continuous random motion<br>  <br>     2. The volume of the molecules present is negligible compared to the total volume occupied by the gas<br>  <br>     3. Intermolecular forces are negligible<br>  <br>     4. Pressure is due to the gas molecules colliding with the walls of the container <br>  <br>      * Real Gases deviate from Ideal Gas Behaviour because: <br>  <br>     1. at low temperatures the gas molecules have less kinetic energy (move around less) so they do attract each other<br>  <br>     2. at high pressures the gas molecules are forced closer together so that the volume of the gas molecules becomes significant compared to the volume the gas occupies <br>  <br>      * Under ordinary conditions, deviations from Ideal Gas behaviour are so slight that they can be neglected<br>  <br>      * A gas which deviates from Ideal Gas behaviour is called a non-ideal gas. <br>  <br>  - Boyle's law as an equation describes that pressure and volume are inversely proportional to each other. (As one decreases, the other must increase.)<br>  <br>  P= pressure, V = volume, k = Boyle's law constant of proportionality<br>  <br>  PV = k<br>  <br>  (P1)(V1) = (P2)(V2)<br>  <br>  P1 and V1 are the initial pressure of the gas and volume that a gas is contained in, respectively, and P2 is the new pressure of the gas because of the new volume of its container, V2.<br>  <br>  - With Boyle's law we can observe how, under constant conditions, gases will react to a change in volume? Not sure how to answer this one<br>  <br>  - Pressure measures not only the frequency of the collisions between gas molecules but also the forces that the molecules exert on the inside of the gas's container. When you have a gas-filled balloon, undisturbed, there is relatively low pressure between the "walls" of the balloon. The gas molecules are sort of drifting around, not colliding very frequently. Once you start squeezing the balloon, the volume essentially decreases because the molecules have less room in which to move. The pressure increases as the molecules not only collide more often but also start to "push back" on the balloon. That is why it feels like the balloon is "pushing back" on you when you squeeze it. A smaller volume brought about increased pressure. Boyle's law. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit.

The relationship between frequency and wavelength is: c = λ*v, where c is the wavespeed and v is the frequency, so:<br>  <br>  L = (1/4)*(2n+1)*c/v_n<br>  <br>  v_n = (1/4)*(2n+1)*c/L<br>  <br>  The ratio, R, of any two successive resonant frequencies is given by:<br>  <br>  v_(n+1)/v_n = R = [2*(n+1)+1]/[2n+1]<br>  <br>  n = (3-R)/(2R-2)<br>  <br>  Here, R = 89.25Hz/63.58Hz = 1.404, so:<br>  <br>  n = (3 - 1.404)/(2.8 - 2) = 1.975 ~= 2<br>  <br>  The lower frequency therefore corresponds to the 2nd overtone, while the higher frequency is the 3rd overtone.<br>  <br>  We how have two equations in two unknowns (c and L):<br>  <br>  L = (1/4)*5*c/(63.58Hz)<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  L = (1/4)*7*c/(89.35Hz)<br>  <br>  You might think that we could solve these two equations for the two unknowns, but these equations are not linearly independent, so we can't.

AA10854273	Well, there are two ways. You could scratch it or melt it over a flame to check composition. Or, you could check the date. The first US penny was minted in 1793 and was 100% pure copper. From 1837-1857 we made them from bronze (an alloy made of 95% copper and the other 5% a mixture of tin and zinc.) In 1857 we began making them from an alloy that was 88% copper and 12$ nickel but they had a whitish appearance and in 1864 we returned to a bronze penny. In 1943 we began making the famous steel pennies. These were made for only one year and were zinc coated steel. There was a copper shortage because of the war. There were a few copper pennies made that year also and they are now quite valuable. In 1962 we stopped using tin in the pennies and they became just 95% copper and 5% zinc. Until 1982 when we changed the ratio again. Pennies are now copper-plated zinc (97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper.)

tv2e834uaa	We will never know the whole story. Something the "victim" did frightened, or threatened the chimp and made it flip out. Animals do not do things for NO reason.

BrarMA1Haa	It's a collection of capacitors, usually wired in parallel.  A typical use is for power factor correction on either electric utility lines or within a building's power system where there are large inductive loads (like induction motors).  A capacitor bank for use within a premises wiring system (i.e., within a building) usually also has a bleed resistor across the bank that bleeds off charge to a safe level of voltage within three minutes of disconnection, and may include fuses and a disconnect switch that generally is required by the National Electrical Code.<br>  <br>  The capacitors provide positive VARs that offset the negative VARs of inductive loads.  Electric utitilties usually like to see the customer's load have a power factor of 0.90 or greater and may charge a fee is fit is less than 0.90.  If it is less than 0.90, the customer may add capacitors to bring the power factor up into the range 0.90-0.95.  There is no need to correct it to unity power factor (so that the load looks purely resistive) because the utility won't provide an economic incentive, and they don't want you to overcorrect to the point where your load appears capacitive, because then the electric system may set up some nasty resonances between your capacitors and the other inductive loads within the power grid.

H7nzr7ykaa	Mass has a force of attraction. This force is called gravity. The larger the mass, the larger the gravitational pull.

It should end "0.75 M HCl."  What you do is take this molarity (0.75 M) and the given volume, converted to liters (0.250 L) to find the number of moles, n = (0.75 M)(0.250 L) = 0.1875 moles.  (Equation used:  M = n/V, rearranged to n = MV.)  To 2 significant figures, that's 0.19 moles.<br>  <br>  Adding the water does not change n, the number of moles of HCl.  It just changes V to a new number, V', which is, in liters, 0.400 L.  To find the new molarity, M', use the equation M' = n/V' = 0.19 moles / 0.400 L = 0.47 M.  That's the concentration of HCl, but, because HCl is a strong, monoprotic acid, it is also the concentration of H3O+.  To find the pH, take the base-ten log (logarithm) of this number, 0.47 M, and then multiply what you get by -1, and you will have your answer via the following formula:  pH = - log[H3O+].  I'd do that myself, but I can't find my calculator, can't figure out how to get the calculator to work on this borrowed laptop, and don't know how to calculate logarithms in my head.

And sometimes people are forced to memorize the sum of cubes formula:<br>  <br>  a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)<br>  <br>  When you put in a = x^2 and b = 5 you get exactly the factorization you wanted.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad if you have trouble factoring high degree polynomials.  In general they are very difficult to factor: when you can do it, it is because there is some kind of "trick" (like noticing the sum of cubes thing above).  As a random example, x^5 + 3x + 1 will resist any amount of cleverness in attempting to factor it.  It just doesn't factor nicely.  (If you take sufficiently advanced algebra classes in college, you can actually _prove_ that there is a sense in which this not factorable.)

There are over 2 million species of wildlife that have never been found.  Maybe even more.  Until its proven that the Borneo monster doesn't exist, no one can say that it can't without scientific evidence.  So, the people that doubt existence have to show conclusive evidence on why it doesn't exist.  The Amazon river and the waterways that flow into it are so large and vast.

This snake is said to be Borneo's version of the Loch Ness Monster but the photos themselves can actually be of anything, including a Photoshop job. One photo shows the snake happily swimming in the Baleh River, while the other photo reveals the snake peering above the waters off the coast of Borneo near a small fishing village. If this snake is real, exactly what kind of snake might it be?<br>  <br>  It is possible this snake can be a a real water serpent, as some reptiles tend to live in water such as the alligator. Or it could be an eel, mistaken for a sea serpent, as the natives believe to see every now and then. It can even be an entirely new species of snake, for all the scientists know. Not too long ago a fossil of a 45 foot long snake was discovered in Colombia in South America. Given the tropical climate of that part of the world, it is not unusual for a snake to attain such a gargantuan size. The Brazilian rain forests are known for their anacondas, even though these snakes are nowhere near a hundred feet long.<br>  <br>  Those who live on the island of Borneo have even given the monster a name - Nabau - making it feel more at home and giving them a bit of notoriety. Every culture deserves to have some legend to call their own, even if it bears a similarity to a legend in a loch located in the United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  Looking at the photos again and again, soon the reputed snake ceases to be real. It looks like someone manipulated the creature, if there was one, in the area when the photos were being taken. It looks to smooth to be a curved branch just flowing with the water current down the river and off the coast. The village doesn't look too lively but it is of course possible everyone there was elsewhere or taking a nap.<br>  <br>  If the photos were manipulated, the most likely creature that got stretched was an eel. Eels are common in warm bodies of water so it wouldn't surprise me if some Indonesian eel had his photo snapped when he wasn't looking. At least it gives the people in Borneo something to talk about and it puts the island on the map.|`|pR2hy0bjaa	No i don't think it is real. The photographs are photoshopped or edited. I think the story is just like Bigfoot or lochness it just shows how gullible people are.

AA10335036	From the description in the ref., it seems not, since any amount of ionizing radiation produces an "avalanche" in which the gas in the Geiger-Muller tube goes completely ionized and conducting. So it outputs the same amplitude pulse no matter which type of radiation initiated it. It is possible to increase the energy of the detection threshold by reducing the bias voltage on the tube. One could then filter out the lower-energy events, but distinguishing the type from energy alone could become complicated, since particle velocities can vary.

WPPIaLORaa	If ozone increases at high altitudes, it is beneficial because the ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation which can be very damaging to life forms when it is excessive.  It causes human skin cancer.<br>  <br>  However, ozone at ground level is a problem.  It is a major air pollutant in large cities.  It can exacerbate respiratory problems.<br>  <br>  (Note:  There is only one ozone.  There are not ozone gases.  Perhaps you mean ozone-depleting gases, which cause ozone in the stratosphere to be broken down, increasing the amount of ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth's surface.  )

Animals that rely on oxygen dissolved in water - like fish and crustaceans - will leave the dead zone or suffocate.

5c73173687a1f12a04793789493e8989aa	"Up to isomorphism" is just a phrase that mathematicians use when they want to consider all isomorphic structures to be the same, in a problem.<br>  <br>  For example, I might say "Find all groups of order 2, up to isomorphism". So, you might tell me to look at Z_2 and Z/2Z. These are technically different structures, but they are isomorphic. So, you would only answer Z_2.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.|`|QNyztmU3aa	The phrase makes more sense in a specific context.  Often one wants to characterize a certain construction according to certain properties that it possesses, and this requires a uniqueness statement; that way any time another object arises with the same properties you will be able to conclude that it is in some sense the same as the one you started with.  But it is typical for the properties that are of greatest interest in mathematics to interact nicely with structure preserving maps (morphisms) between objects, and thus the properties can only distinguish between objects that can be distinguished by such morphisms.<br>  <br>  OK, this is getting way too confusing, so I'm going to try to give an example.  Here is a statement where the phrase "up to isomorphism" appears: there is a unique real vector space of dimension n up to (linear) isomorphism.  Of course there are lots and lots of real vector spaces of dimension n - R^n, the space of polynomials with real coefficients of degree no larger than n, the tangent space of a n-manifold at any point, etc. - but all of them are isomorphic to each other.  This is useful because it allows you to carry over any construction that you can make for a specific vector space of dimension n to all others, so long as your construction does not depend on any specific aspects of the one that you start with (such as a specific coordinate system).  For example, it is fairly easy to show that R^n admits an inner product, and thus the tangent space to an n-manifold at any given point also admits an inner product.<br>  <br>  One can also make stronger uniqueness statements by asserting that a certain construction is unique up to unique isomorphism.  To say that X is the unique object with properties p and q up to unique isomorphism is to say that if Y is another object with properties p and q then there is one and only one isomorphism from X to Y.  This is much stronger and allows you to make much more refined statements; for instance, it is NOT true that there is a unique vector space of dimension n up to unique isomorphism (given two vector spaces of dimension n, there is an isomorphism between them for every choice of bases for each space).  An example of an object that is unique up to unique isomorphism is the tensor product of two vector spaces.  In general, when a construction comes equipped with a universal property that characterizes it, it will be unique in this stronger sense.

xTioPxaVaa	There are two ways to do these effects, and neither one of them are particularly easy.<br>  <br>  Analog reverb (like in a Fender amp) uses a series of springs in what's commonly referred to as a tank.  It requires a drive circuit to excite the springs, and then another amplification stage at the opposite end of the springs to recover the sound.  It's normally then mixed back in parallel with the original signal.<br>  <br>  Delay...that was originally done with tape.  If you Google "Maestro Echoplex", you'll see how it was done.  It involved a tape loop, a record head, and then a playback head that was physically moveable.  The further apart the record and playback heads were, the longer the delay.<br>  <br>  Now, it can all be done using Digital Signal Processor (DSP chips).  But, unless you're buying an off-the-shelf module or you know how to write the code, this isn't going to help you.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to include a break point between the preamp and the power amp (an effects loop).  If it's a tube amp, then it's between the preamp and the phase inverter.  This will allow you to insert an effects unit.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken
fmr98EBtaa	Alright, heterozygous and hybrid mean the same thing, so this question is trying to trip you up from the start! :P If an animal or plant is heterozygous or is a hybrid for a trait, that means it has two different alleles for it. Is there more information provided in this question? Because I can't really explain it all without knowing what other traits these plants can have. Meaning, can the plant be short? And is there some other color it can be? I'm assuming there is.<br>  <br>  When it asks you for the gametes of each parent it is asking for the possible combinations of alleles that the parent can give to a child. The genotype for each parent is something like this (T for tall, P for purple) TtPp. You need to figure out all the possible combinations of T's and P's that can end up in the gamete. The possibilities are: TP, Tp, tP, tp.<br>  <br>  The "what will the offspring look like" question is asking you for the phenotype of the offspring. What can the plants end up looking like? Possibilities: Dominant Height & Dominant Color, Dominant Height & Recessive Color, Recessive Height & Dominant Color,  Recessive Height & Recessive Color. (Whatever those happen to be, I don't know what the other size and color options are)<br>  <br>  Dihybrid crosses (Crosses between two hyrbid parents in which two traits are compared. In this case the traits are height and color.) have a 9:3:3:1 ratio  (For every 1 recessive/recesive offspring, there will be 3 dominant/recessive, 3 recessive/dominant, and 9 dominant/dominant offspring.) in their phenotypes. You can do punnet square to figure this out, but just knowing the ratio helps.|`|2YkEQrmvaa	Is this typed correctly?  Heterozygous and hybrid means the same thing.  But I'll answer as it was written.<br>  <br>  if the gene for height is H:<br>  <br>  Both heterozygous plants can pass on a H or an h.<br>  <br>  there's a 25% (1/4) chance of each of these:  HH, Hh, hH, hh<br>  <br>  That means the phenotypic ratio is 3:1<br>  3 dominant (HH, Hh, Hh) to one recessive (hh)

3lDitjqKaa	1. yes. the acceleration can be in the opposite direction of the initial motion therefore eventually reversing the direction.<br>  <br>  2. No because if the magnitude of acceleration decreases the speed will plateau. Bakushin, how can the object accelerate if no force is acting on it? Once you let go the box would travel at a constant speed.|`|W7SL318Gaa	YES, for example, if you throw something up in the air it is accelerating downward at 9.8m/s the whole time, even when it is going up, then at a certain point it does come down instead of up, changing velocity direction.<br>  <br>  YES, if I understand correctly. for example, if you push a box constantly hard it will accelerate and accelerate. if you then push it a little lighter it will continue to accelerate, not as much as before, but its speed keeps increasing  while the magnitude of acceleration decreases.<br>  <br>  (first one 100% confident second, 100% if I understood it correctly)
3lDitjqKaa	Yes. If you shoot an object vertically, it will have zero velocity and a negative 9.8m/s^2 acceleration at the top of its trajectory.<br>  <br>  Velocity is speed with a direction. An object cannot be traveling at a constant speed in a specific direction while varying its speed. An object can have a varying acceleration while maintaining a constant velocity by turning.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	can an object have zero velocity and still be accelerating? <br>  <br>  yes, if you toss something in the air, at it's peak the velocity is zero and acceleration is downwards.<br>  <br>  can an object have a constant velocity and still have a varying speed? <br>  <br>  no. Velocity includes speed as one of it's attributes (the other is direction). so if velocity is constant, speed is constant also.<br>  <br>  .

We use the same equation, but this time we have s = 4.2m, a = 0, t = 1.34s, and we are trying to find V(0):<br>  <br>  4.2m = V(0)*1.34s + 0,<br>  <br>  which gives V(0) = 3.1 m/s.

ebfe21e4693a7038f59529f6ba61a937aa	Think about how organisms carry out the functions of life: they inherit DNA which they "read" and form proteins based on the "instructions," then pass the DNA on to their offspring. Animals normally inherit half of their DNA from one parent and half from the other. This gives the chance for variation and unique features in each generation. <br>  By cloning, all of the DNA will be copied from one animal to make new animals with the same set of DNA. This will cause each cloned animal to be genetically identical, so many features that would vary in a normal flock would be mostly the same in a cloned flock.<br>  An advantage of this would be the elimination of certain genetic diseases or bad traits for the flock, such as poor milk production in dairy cows. <br>  A disadvantage would be less chance for variation, such as stronger immune system/defense against infection - which may not be an easy trait to select for when breeding but is always appreciated when it comes up at random in some of the flock members. By breeding only genetically identical animals, the opportunity of positive unknown traits is lessened, and the chance of inbreeding on negative/undesirable traits is increased.

YOqbGO2Maa	I think the average temperature would be 2 or 3 deg C colder than now.  Since the poles would be colder and the equator warmer, this would make the global winds stronger.  The weather would be more predicable, but there would be more storms and rain/snow in most places. Deserts would be smaller and dryer.  The extra snow up north would reflect sun light and heat away from Earth.  (There's less land mass in the far south, so it would have much less effect.)    If there was less land up north, and more around the equator, and also if the Arctic ocean wasn't nearly landlocked, then I would say the average temperature wouldn't change.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	The average temperature would be about the same, but the poles would be colder and the equator a little hotter.

The even baking would melt the ice caps. With zero tilt, the sun would shine on the poles without ever setting (a permanent half-disk on the horizon). The arctic circles would receive 12 hrs of sunlight daily, like everywhere else on Earth. Although the sun's rays here are less direct, there would be no deep-freeze like in the darkness of winter each year, so there would be no ice caps.    With all of Earth's water in the liquid state, and no freezing temperatures anywhere, Earth would experience a runaway greenhouse effect. As the oceans evaporate and condense as clouds, the greater the greenhouse effect. The temperature gets hotter and hotter. The hotter it gets, the faster water evaporates. The oceans would literally be dry, with all of Earth's water locked in the atmosphere as vapor. On the surface, the atmospheric pressure would be roughly equivalent to that of the average depth of all the oceans. There would be NO WEATHER- just check out the conditions of Venus (it has near zero axial tilt).    Sorry, but I have no idea how to calculate where the temperature would stabilize. I can only speculate - maybe 150 deg C? 140 deg C at the poles?

NbdTgyLPaa	The formula for resistance in parallel is that the inverse of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the inverse of each individual resistance.  Or....<br>  1/R = 1/r + 1/r + 1/r + 1/r + 1/r<br>  where R = total parallel resistance and r = the resistance of each piece of wire, so<br>  1/R = 5/r<br>  r = 5R<br>  But we know that R = 49.0 (note you didn't give the units the resistance was measured in, so I can't give that to you either, but most likely it is Ohms.)  So,<br>  r = 245<br>  Now the original wire's resistance is effectively the same as these five pieces of wire connected in series.  The total series resistance is equal to the sum of each component, so the original wires resistance is...<br>  = r + r + r + r + r<br>  = 5r<br>  = 1225 (in the same units as whatever 49.0 was supposed to be)<br>  So 1225 <insert units here> was the resistance of the original wire.

However, do not discount that many scientists also feel that admitting that the scientific method is a logical guessing game, some times inspired by illogical thnking or serendipitous mental connections, to the general public is potentially too big a risk, because their (the scientists' and science in general) credibility with the general public might suffer. It took me over an hour with my master's degree mentor to get him to admit that the scientific method is a logical guessing game with occasional inspiration, and that most Ph.D.s would never admit that a to a non-scientist (general public), except for the few renegades who have already established their own credibility with the public and their peers. No, he didn't actually say the "except" part. <br>  <br>  "Is it at a disadvantage by excluding possibilities that it sees as being unscientific?"<br>  <br>  Well, yes and no. I think this depends, a lot, on how open-minded an individual scientist is, not how smart they are. I think what is far more insidious is when scientists get stuck in a particular paradigm (mode ot thinking), and they don't even realize the possibility that that particular paradigm is so established that it is time high time for a paradigm shift, or "thinking outside of the box", especially when evidence is or might be accumulating for years that a particular paradigm might be outdated.<br>  <br>  I have only one example of an outdated paradigm. Many M.D.s who are supposedly experts in managing type 1 diabetes believe it is an auto-immune disease like muscular dystrophy or lupus. Speaking as some-one who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1955, I disagree. I believe a lot of type 1 diabetes is induced by viruses. I had roseola in November, 1954, according to my mother's notes in one of my baby books. Roseola is caused by a virus. I suspect that either the virus, or the virus set off a chain of immunologic effects in my body that attacked and destroyed my the beta cells (the cells that produce insulin) and killed my ability to make new beta cells, permanently. If my immune system has been compromised my entire life, and my body continually destroys any beta cells it produces, why did I recover from chicken pox when I was four, red measles before my 11th birthday in 1964 ( months before the first red measles vaccine was available), and several rounds of strep throat. The last time I had a cold with a fever, and having a fever with a cold is not normal for me, was in 1998, I think. It might have been in 2002. I haven't had a flu vaccination since 2004, I haven't had the flu in so long that I've forgotten when was the last time I had the flu (1976???).<br>  <br>  "Does science have room for spirituality, divine intervention, alien intervention, miracles or any other sort of unquantifiable information.<br>  ..." Again, that depends on the open-mindedness of an individual scientist. There are plenty of phenomena that scientists can observe, but they can't assign numbers to.

CCeRdaoLaa	If you look around online, there are a few companies that sell collagenase, an enzyme that specifically breaks down collagen.  You might want to include some trypsin in the mix too, to break down any non-collagen protein that may be in there (or, rather, alternate between trypsin and collagenase incubations, otherwise the trypsin will probably begin to digest the collagenase).    The trick would be to get the collagenase inside the bone itself, so it doesn't just digest the collagen near the surface.  You might want to try a long incubation on a rocker.  Trypsin and collagenase aren't too expensive, and you can probably find some at Sigma-Aldrich or a similar company.
xz4Cf3xfaa	Has this nations spacefarers confronted the unknown in space? The answer is a resounding yes. The problem is that the mass media usually fails to widely distribute any such experiences. At least some of this nations astronauts have had unexplained experiences and voiced views radically different from conventional thinking.    In his post-NASA career, Cooper became known as an outspoken believer in UFOs and charged that the government was covering up its knowledge of extraterrestrial activity.     "I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth" he told a United Nations panel in 1985.     "I feel that we need to have a top-level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion"     He added, "For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all specialists and astronauts. I can now reveal that every day, in the USA, our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us"    Okay for all you who gave thumbs down to the most intelligent answers, what makes you think you have all the answers?

But it is NOT visiting us.    Did you actually read any of these?  This is the first two paragraphs in your first link.    OMNI: What about the repeated allegations that the astronauts saw many UFOs?    COOPER: It got so bad that there were deliberately falsified tapes of communications with the astronauts, where UFO material was simply edited in. To my knowledge, the only astronaut on any of the Mercury, Gemini, or Apollo missions who ever saw anything that might have been a UFO was Jim McDivitt, but he didn't get enough pictures to prove anything substantial. That's the only case, in spite of all the stories you hear.    He's saying it's not true.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	That is no evidence, it is opinions. Mitchell just spreads conspiracy theories, most likely because his "research" in ESP and remote healing did not work out.     Gordon's account just says, that he did not know what it was, what he saw. UFO, no question. But there are about one million phenomena on this planet which have higher probabilities as the alien spacecraft theory. Even just lenticular clouds. If you can't estimate the distance and size of things correctly, you will evade them, not the other way around. And that he saw the stuff over Germany, in the 1950s, should make people even more concerned. Ever read the US intelligence reports about Germany from 1946? ;) Cooper did sure not read them.    Obviously, there are many cases, were stuff was not faked, but badly interpreted with many assumptions and both eyes closed.|`|BrjZhySIaa	I think it is quite interesting and I love hearing the stories by those who have had a 'sighting'.

Initially Joseph Walker was the first to announce a sighting. On May 11, 1962 NASA pilot Joseph Walker said that one of his tasks was to detect UFOs during his X-15 flights. He had filmed five or six UFOs during his record breaking fifty-mile-high flight in April 1962. It was the second time he had filmed UFOs in flight. During a lecture at the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space Research.     NASA may well be a civilian agency, but many of its programs are funded by the defense budget and most of the astronauts are subject to military security regulations. Apart from the fact that NASA screens all films and probably radio communications as well.,, there are the statements by Otto Binder, Dr. Garry Henderson and Maurice Chatelain that the astronauts were under strict orders not to discuss their sightings. Gordon testified to a United Nations committee that one of the astronauts actually witnessed a UFO on the ground. If there is no secrecy, why has this sighting not been made public? NASA's Scott Carpenter "At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was a constant surveillance by UFOs."     The evidence regarding this subject is clear and overwhelming if we are to believe the first-hand experiences made by most of astronauts while in space. It would not been difficult to make a compelling case for the reality of UFOs what is a greater challenge is elucidating the architecture of secrecy related to UFOs! Butwhy all the secrecy?   Why a black' or unacknowledged government within the government? Why hide the UFO/ET subject from public view? Why are the astronauts under strict orders not to discuss their sightings?    In conclusion: Ending the secrecy surrounding the UFO/ET subject is a laudable goal. It is long overdue. It would transform the world in ways both simple and profound.If Cooper and Mitchell had not broke ranks and made their sightings public we would still be wondering if there were sightings from any reliable sources. I admit I have some doubts but I question, Who am I to doubt statements from such principled and credible icons?|`|35PAXOv2aa	 Cooper never said it was untrue! Here is what he did say verbatim...  Cooper wrote a letter to the ambassador of the Mission of Grenada to the United Nations supporting a UN initiative to study UFOs. In his letter, Cooper stated that astronauts are very reluctant to even discuss UFOs due to the great numbers of people who have indiscriminately sold fake stories and forged documents abusing their names and reputations without hesitation. Those few astronauts who have continued to participate in the UFO field have had to do so very cautiously. There are several of us who do believe in UFOs and who have had occasion to see a UFO on the ground, or from an airplane.    Cooper, in a letter read during a 1978 meeting at the United Nations to discuss UFOs, stated, ...I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet form other planets, which are obviously a little more advanced than we are here on Earth.     Two astronauts who appear to have broken ranks are Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper. On an Oprah Winfrey Show on July 19, 1991, Mitchell hinted that all information regarding UFOs has not been released, saying, I do believe that here is a lot more known about extraterrestrial investigation than is available to the public right now. On Dateline NBC in 1996, Mitchell was even more candid. I have no firsthand experience, but I have had the opportunity to meet with people from three countries who in the course of their official duties claim to have had personal firsthand encounter experiences...with extraterrestrials, Recently, Mitchell flatly stated that some advanced military craft use technology derived from alien spacecraft that have been collected by the U.S. Government.

Hope this helps.|`|vPqk1SGHaa	Motion with constant acceleration is covered by two equations:  distance x(t) = X0 + V0 * t + A * t^2 /2  velocity v(t) = V0 + A * t  where: X0 is initial distance, V0 initial velocity, A acceleration, t time  Any other equation is somehow derived from these two.   In your case acceleration is negative but that does not make a difference.   x0 = 0, x = 5m, A = -0.25m/s^2, vf = 0 you need V0 and t  You got two equations with two unknowns:  x = V0 * t + A * t^2 /2  0 = V0 + A * t   ==> t = -V0 / A  substitute  x = V0 * -V0 / A + A * (-V0 / A)^2 / 2  x = V0 * -V0 / A + V0^2 / (A * 2)  x = -V0^2 / A + V0^2 /(2*A)  x = -V0^2 / (2*A)  V0 = sq root(-2 * A * x) = sq root(-2 * -0.250m/s^2 * 5m) = 1.58m/s  To get time use second equation:  t = -V0 / A = -1.58m/s / -0.250m/s^2 = 6.32s  It looks like we have a discrepancy

Now I cannot think of the other properties off of the top of my head but I know how to do it without knowing so it is fine. After you have the 6x-12>5x+17 you need to get the variable to one side and the number on the other. Since the 12 is a minus + 12 to both sides to get rid of 12 on the left and put 12 to the right{6x>5x+17+12}. Also since 5x is a plus subtract 5x on both sides to get rid of it on the right and put it on the left{6x-5x>17+12}. now combine the like terms.1x>32.and there you go, X>32.  For the rest of the problems use the same formula. Now I know of a lot of different alternatives to this answer based on what the problem is asking but from what you gave I hope I helped. I almost forgot if you need to divide at the end, say you get something like -2x>6 and you have to divide both sides by negative two to get rid of the 2 on the left; just make sure you remember that the {} sign has to be flipped. even if you were multiplying if you are doing it by a negative, the sign flips. like the answer to my little problem would be x-3
aaC2Qx1Uaa	Because that's how evolution works:    There are limited resources available for organisms to exploit, so they have to compete between each other to obtain those resources.  And it is the organisms which are most "fit" (best at it) which survive and pass their genes on: the majority of organisms will not survive, and will not pass their genes on. So only the "best" genes persist to the next population: and that is evolution!|`|YGPKbyUdaa	because they all died - the species that didn't benefit from evolution got killed or eaten|`|0rF1be2baa	wat!? because animals arn't gifted with the power of eternal life. theres also a thing called the food chain whereby animals kill other animals thus keeping a populations in check. for example if the number of rabbits increased alot then foxes for example would have more to eat so there population would grow. however due to the increasing number of foxes rabbits get fewer and fewer as they are eaten by the foxes. now the foxes don't have ne thing to eat so the population decreases. now there are less foxes so the rabbit population increases and so it goes on. this is a simple example but you can see what i mean|`|De4vgWXPaa	>    Are you familiar with the word death?

Then there's the extinction at the time of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago.  That time 60-70% of all living things died.  There are many other extinction events not as famous as those two.  The last extinction event was about 10,000 years ago.  When environment changes rapidly, creatures either adapt or die.  Either the temperature get too hot or too cold, if you can't adapt quick enough you die.  Evolution doesn't give you immortality.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	first of all, there are creatures EVERYWHERE    second of all, humans are part of the animal kingdom and we have covered the whole earth|`|WX1b747Iaa	They eat each other, and we eat them.

Also since there are limited resources on the earth, this also acts as a limiting factor that helps to select for the animals best fit to use them.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	First off, it is overrun by animals, they are called homo sapiens. Secondly, what animal lives forever ? Thirdly there is the law of supply and demand, not enough food - animal populations decrease, etc. Fourth - some animals are smart enough to have evolved to not have offspring if food is scarce. An example are deer - they will not have babies if there is not enough food, even if inseminated - the egg will not fertilize until the food supply is abundant. Pretty slick huh. Oh and then there are those pesky homo sapiens, who have managed to wipe out entire species of animals that were on the planet all by themselves in just a short span of time.

xcmQZeyvaa	This is a pretty complicated problem, but simple once you see the answer.  <br>  <br>  First, you have to notice that 2 * (e^-1) is equal to 2/e.  Remember, that e is just a constant, just like pi, so you can simply put it outside of the integral sign and just concentrate on the rest of the problem, which is...<br>  <br>  The integral of t*(e^t) dt.<br>  <br>  You'll have to know integration of parts to do this integral.  <br>  The formula of that is...<br>  Sudv = uv - Svdu  , where S means integral sign.  <br>  <br>  So, let's substitute.<br>  u=t, then du=dt<br>  dv=e^t dt, then v=e^t<br>  <br>  So, our uv - Svdu would be...<br>  <br>  t*(e^t) - S(e^t) dt.<br>  <br>  And the integral of e^t is simply e^t.  So, we have t*(e^t) - e^t.  We're not done yet though; we still have our 2/e that we left of earlier. <br>  <br>  (2/e) * [t*(e^t) - e^t] + c<br>  <br>  That's your answer; you can distribute if you'd like to make it look nicer.|`|78b14bfd8ea4980a9a4fa7e7ec7952f1aa	integral((2/e)*t*e^tdt)=(2/e)*t*e^t-(2/e...<br>  =(2/e)*t*e^t-(2/e)*(e^t)+c<br>  =2*e^(t-1)*(t-1)+c
Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it couldn't.  There is no empty space for it to drain into.  The mantle is below the crust, the outer core and the inner core below that.

Cracks in the sea floor generally extrude lava.|`|jfwmelYgaa	Dude....what a good question....I can't answer it...but still a sweet question....|`|a86HbDIZaa	No.    There already IS a giant crack in the sea bed, it's called the mid-ocean rift. Since the oceans are still wet, they are likely to remain so.|`|VlsvYCzuaa	1) The earth is not hollow, so there is no-where for the water to drain into.    2) Where the seabed "cracks" and the mantle is exposed, the seawater is heated. If the sea is shallow enough it could boil off and evaporate, but then more seawater will flow towards the contact. The evaporated water will condense and fall as rain and replenish the sea.    So, no on both counts.
mHnd1FJTaa	Acetates are sweet-smelling - butyl and ethyl acetates are often found in nailpolish.  Ethyl acetate is now the new nailpolish remover solvent that's slowly overtaking acetone, since it's not as dangerous.  Since both these solvents smell so sweet, they have to put "Bitrex" in the nailpolish remover to discourage drinking!    Chlorine isn't a bad smell - I suppose one could say it's associated with a clean smell, very 'chemical' smelling.    Ammonia is a sharp, putrid odor.

If it exists, it must therefore be a brown dwarf. It could be a small black hole but this is extremely unlikely. <br>  <br>  The Lunisolar Precession Theory is one way to explain precession of the axis, it remains unproven and has its mathematical problems which tend to be resolved using a binary star theory. This is most hyped by the Binary Research Institute.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org/bri/research/evidence/lunarcycle.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org/b...</a><br>  <br>  NASA's Gravity Probe B has the task of collecting data to determine if precession is the result of our Sun's movement through space or not. This is where truth should be evident.<br>  <br>  It has been shown that when a protostar ignites, the solar wind blast has the potential of creating a nebular condensation which could create a binary star. Binary star systems are more common than single stars. Yet when we look at our local area of stars, only about 60% are binary.<br>  <br>  There is not enough supportive observational data to support the contention that our Sun is in a binary system. Nibiru, The Dark Star, Nemesis... whatever name one wishes to place upon this supposed binary companion to our Sun... has never been found by any space probe nor telescope.

Anyone educated in the amount of factors required for life forms to arise, evolve, and survive bolide impacts long enough to develop into an intelligent species understands that binary star systems are not conducive to life forms. The binary stars must not be too close nor too far away from each other.

D5QgyGbXaa	Three body problem of gravitational attraction for the sun, moon and earth is complicated.<br>  Earth-moon system has a common rotational center called the barycenter.  It is 3000 miles from the center of the earth, or about 1000 miles under the crust.<br>  Moon is egg-shaped, with the wide, heavy end pointed always at earth in a harmonic lock due to tidal forces.  The rotation of the moon and the revolution period around the earth are the same.<br>  The moon has libration, or a slight nodding both left-right and up-down as seen from earth.  This is caused by variation in speed around the earth in the moon's elliptical orbit.<br>  The moon's orbit is tilted by about 9 degrees from the ecliptic.  This would mean that eclipses of sun and moon can occur when the lunar orbital plane is aligned so that the moon passes in a line with earth and sun, instead of slightly above or below that line.<br>  The offset forces of the moon's gravity on the earth's spin causes its axis to precess with a period of 26,000 years.  Polaris as a pole star is only temporary.  In about 13,000 years the pole star will be Vega.<br>  There may be long term variations in the earth's distance from the sun, perhaps causing ice ages.|`|weBWzGxKaa	tidal forces!  as well as earthquakes and storms,

Rc7Sz5TSaa	Answer: f100(3) = 2/3<br>  <br>  Solution:<br>  f0(x)=1/(1-x) and fn+1=f0 of fn.

So:<br>  100 = 1 + (n-1)3 => n = 34 <br>  Hence 100 is the 34th term of this progression. Thus from (2):<br>  f1(x) = f100 (x) = (x-1)/x (from (2))<br>  So f100(3) = f1(3) = 2/3

This is NOT forbidden by relativity.  What is forbidden by relativity are relative motions that can produce causal violations (observer A sees event 1 causing event 2, whereas observer B sees event 2 occurring before event 1).  Superluminal expansion of the entire spacetime manifold does not create causal violations and is not forbidden, because the objects travelling faster than light with respect to each other are not close to each other.<br>  <br>  The size of the Big Bang is not known.  It may, in fact, be infinite or extremely large at all times after t = 0, and quantum mechanics suggests that t = 0 may not occur at all.  Basically, modern physics has nothing useful to say about times prior to 10^-25 seconds or so after the "bang".<br>  <br>  P.S.  More about size: General relativity suggests that the BB began in a singularity.  If true, then there is no "before", that's the beginning of time.  However, what we understand about quantum mechanics suggests that an actual singularity is impossible, and that something happens at back at 10^-30 seconds that we don't understand.  At that time, the Universe could still be large---arbitrarily large.  We have no way of determining the size.  Going forward in time, our event horizon expands linearly in time.  During the "early inflation", an enormous amount of material moved beyond our event horizon faster than the speed of light---an amount of material estimated to be about 10^33 times more than the part of the Universe we can see now.<br>  <br>  So there's our event horizon, 13.7 billion lightyears away, and beyond that, there's a vast amount of material that has the same physical properties as our local Universe.  Beyond that, we don't know---beyond that, there presumably is material with which we were never in causal contact, and (given Dark Energy) never will be in causal contact.  It may have "different physics" since the Higgs boson is settled into a different state.  So the Universe is vast, much more vast than the mere 13.7 billion lightyear radius sphere we currently see, and we don't know what's beyond that, and perhaps never will.|`|b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	While it is true that in our universe, the speed of light cannot be exceeded, it is important that the Big Bang formed our universe.  Thus, our universe and its laws and properties did not exist until the Big Bang.  We do not know what laws and properties were present in the singularity that expanded.  However, it is likely that the speed of light wasn't an issue since light is an artifact of this universe.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	"Wouldn't mass traveling faster than the speed of light violate one of the fundamental laws of physics?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Under these conditions, no it wouldn't, because it was space itself that expanded.

It misses something though. Something left undisclosed. Most of these big-headed people like Einstein and Sagan and the wheel chair dude, they all believe in some kind of god. The reason I think they do, Is because they see the fallacy of accepting the big bang as fact without asking what came before that. So, there was the start of the universe and matter and time but what was happening a month before the big bang? You see the conflict? The math is important and it does indeed describe the period right after the explosion and calls it the period of inflation. A quick expansion followed by 13-15 billion years of steady expansion. The question of what comes next, has not been answered. It will either  expand forever or at a critical point, stop and reverse into a collapse. The funny thing is the Indian God Bhrama, is said to sleep every 30 billions years. Yeah, billion. I know that sounds wrong but it isn't.  What if the universe expands and contracts every 30 billions years or so and we exist in every cycle. More or less the same each time but with small alterations. Could that explain deja vu? Are we using genetic memory at the subatomic level to  recall experience that was lived and relived billions or trillions of times?

A thrust fault is a low angle reverse fault.  These happen in convergent zones.|`|9lzNDwhZaa	A reverse fault is the result of compression (pushing together) within a system whilst normal faulting is the result of extension (pulling apart). This results in REPETITION of the rock unit 'on top' of itself. There are several pictures of reverse faults in the reference cited below. Reverse fault are always at quite steep angles of 45 to 85 degrees relative to the horizontal.<br>  <br>  Reverse and normal faults are the result of VERTICAL movement relative to the fault plane. Where there is horizontal movement, in which two bodies of rock move horizontally slide relative to each other, you have a wrench fault.<br>  <br>  A thrust fault is the result of very low angle faulting where one body of rock end up sitting on top of another body of rock that it previously been adjacent to.<br>  <br>  Reverse faulting can do damage but most observed faulting events have never been recorded.

zwfP0Ia7aa	Igneous becomes sedimentary by weathering/erosion into smaller and rock particles (over lots and lots of time)... for example the quartz from granite (common igneous rock) becomes quartz sand.  The sediment is then carried by water (river) or ice (glaciers) or something and deposited.  Over lots and lots of time, all that quartz sand is buried, compacted, heated and cemented (chemically) eventually forming the sedimentary rock, sandstone.

Giving it additional weight will help overcome drag, so it can fall faster.<br>  <br>  Another way to make it fall fast is to enclose it in a vacuum. Where there is no air there is no drag, so your whirly bird will fall as fast as a rock. I doubt you have the equipment (or desire) to create this experiment, but it is certainly worth mentioning to your teacher as it will show that you have an understanding of drag, and that gravity acts on all objects equally. (A feather will fall as fast as a 500 ton rock in vacuum).

gM8GCbyRaa	You know a right triangles sides  a^2+b^2=c^2, where a and b are the two legs and c is the hypotenuse (meaning the longest). A triangle has 3 sides, so in your case there would be 3 integers needed. Let's call the first integer x. Then the next consecutive integer is x+1. And, by the same logic, the one after that is x+2. So now that we have labeled the integers let's set them to be sides. We know that x+2 has to be the hypotenuse because it is the larger than x and x+1 (since all of the sides have to be positive). So that means x and x+1 are legs. So, use (x)^2+(x+1)^2=(x+2)^2 to find the length of each one. Now, I'm not sure if that's right because your question is kind of vague, but that's how I figure you could do it.

That is inflammation of the covering of the spinal cord (the meninges) and is often associated with infection.  <br>  <br>  An abnormal collection of fluid in the spinal cord is called syrinx or syringomyelia.  An old injury/stroke of the spinal cord that leaves a hole and is then filled in with fluid would be called myelomalacia.  <br>  <br>  The CSF is not primarily in your spinal cord it is mainly in the space surrounding the cord.  There is also a small amount of CSF fluid that is there normally within the central canal of the spinal cord.|`|fyA4uL6Taa	Your supposed to have it its called Cerebral spinal fluid<br>  <br>  What your talking about is and infection/inflammation of the fluid called meningitis<br>  <br>  Meningitis is serious and if not treated can cause death<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis</a>|`|rM6gBb2baa	It's called CSF, and it's supposed to be there.

Each has the same likelihood of being the right password.  He has 3 passwords out of 8.  So the probabililty is 3/8 (37.5%) that he'll have the right password in this case.    So the combined probability is:  40% x 100% = 40%  +  60% x 37.5% = 22.5%    Answer:  62.5% or 5/8
k5Ece8BTaa	You don't need to be freaking out because your fears about the world ending in 2012 is based upon nothing.    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Guess we'll just have to wait and find out huh.

In the same taxa of algae you have Eudorina which live in a multicelluar sphere but there is no sharing of nutrients and each cell is responsible for its own photosynethsis.    In the same taxa Volvox carteri is a colonial organism in which the larger cells are repsonsible for the photosynthsis/reproduction and the small outer cells are reponsible for swimming and they are interdependent on each other for each other's specialized function.

NIb8zWEHaa	Mitosis is the reproduction of skin, heart, stomach, cheek, hair etc. cells. These cells are "Autosomal" cells. This is also a form of "Asexual" reproduction, where one organism or cell reproduces itself. Some organisms that reproduce asexually are hydra, bacteria, and single celled organisms.  "A" greek meaning "without."    "Sex" Greek meaning "to cross."  Meiosis is the production of sperm and egg cells. These cells are "Gamete" or "Sex" cells. Each cell has to go through the division process twice in order for the cell to end up with half the number of chromosomes. The cells pass on genetic information to the offspring. This is a form of "Sexual" reproduction, where one organism or cells reproduces by crossing with another organism or cell. Types of organisms that reproduce sexually are; plants, animals, and insects.
ZKikquiOaa	When Toba erupted, the earth was actually still in the middle of a glaciation period.  The volcanic winter caused by Toba probably extended for a few decades, but the glaciation period that the earth was in at the time didn't clear out until about 10,000 years ago.  Last glaciation period went from about 110,000 to 10,000 years ago.  We're currently in an interglacial period within the current ice age, yes we're still in an ice age.

NSQaDOhYaa	Your overall reaction equation is indeed incorrect; hydrogen is unlikely to be formed during this reaction, and the best overall summary is    Cl2 + CHCl3 --> CCl4 + HCl    The reaction is indeed a free radical chain reaction, comprising the usual three stages of initiation, propagation and termination. The first is usually produced by the uv dissociation of a chlorine molecule    Cl2 + uv --> 2 Cl* where Cl* is the chlorine free radical.    Propagation consists of two steps    CHCl3 + Cl* --> CCl3* + HCl  CCL3* + Cl2 --> CCl4 + Cl*    and termination involves the recombination of free radicals eg    Cl* + Cl* --> Cl2  CCl3* + Cl* --> CCl4    and even    CCl3* + CCl3* --> C2Cl6    While the last occurs in the chlorination of methane, forming an impurity by-product, the probability of this free radical recombination step with trichlormethane is small, simply because the size of the chlorine atoms around the single carbon atom tend to prevent it.|`|c30e2cd4342816ffab5be22eb14c292caa	Your main equation is wrong:    Cl2 + CHCl3 -----> CCl4 + HCl    2Cl2 -----> 2Cldot    Cldot + CHCl3 .----> CCl3dot + HCl  CCl3dot + Cl2 ----> CCl4 + Cldot    CCl3dot + Cldot -----> CCl4

AA10236289	I am assuming that the "squares" are in the center of the pyramid.  With that being said, is it the length of the corner you want from top square to bottom square?  If, just use right-triangles to figure it out.      First, you need to calc the leg length on the bottom.  This would be taking the difference of 1/2 the bottom square length and 1/2 the top square length.  (1/2 is because we are working on one side one the pyramid.)  Convert into similar units!       (.5 x 192") - (.5 x 33") = 96 - 16.5 = 79.5" Bottom Leg Length    Next, your vertical ht. is 28', or 336".    Then, below is how to calc the length of the pyramid wall perpendicular to each square side.  This would be the hypotenuse of the rt triangle.      Using (HYP)^2 = (SIDE a)^2 + (SIDE B)^2  (HYP)^2 = (79.5")^2 + (336")^2  (HYP)^2 = 6320.25sq.in. + 112896sq.in.  (HYP)^2 = 119216.25sq.in.  HYP = 345.28" = 28ft 9.25"    This calc. HYP is now the other leg for the next right triangle.  The calc. bottom leg above is the the same leg as the first.    So, if you plug in the numbers according to the above HYP formula, the new HYP answer will be the length of the line from the top square corners to the bottom square corners.    (HYP)^2 = (79.5")^2 + (345.28")^2   HYP = 354.31" = 29ft 6-5/16"

AA10927246	I wouldn't expect any of them to have 3 boys and 5 girls because that would be 8 children.  Did you mean 3 boys and 2 girls?    If so, count the number of ways to pick 3 boys from 5 children (or 2 girls from 5 children; the answer is the same)  C(5,3) = C(5,2) = 5! / 3! 2!  = 120 / 6*2  = 10 ways    But that's out of how many ways to arrange 5 births?  You have 2 choices for the first birth (boy or girl), 2 for the second, etc.  That's 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 ways.    The probability of 3 boys is therefore:  10/32   = 5/16    You could have also written:  C(5,2) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2, but that's just the same thing:  10 * 1/32   = 10/32   = 5/16    And with 800 families, you'd expect 5/16 to have 3 boys.    800 x 5/16 = 250 families    P.S.  Here's the total breakdown.  P(boys = 0) = 1/32 --> 25 families  P(boys = 1) = 5/32 --> 125 families  P(boys = 2) = 5/16 --> 250 families  P(boys = 3) = 5/16 --> 250 families***  P(boys = 4) = 5/32 --> 125 families  P(boys = 5) = 1/32 --> 25 families

HyUE9ON0aa	On July 24, 1684, La Salle sailed from France and returned to America with a large expedition designed to establish a French colony on the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the Mississippi River. They left France in 1684 with four ships and 300 colonists. The expedition was plagued by pirates, hostile Indians, and poor navigation. One ship was lost to pirates in the West Indies, a second sank in the inlets of Matagorda Bay, where a third ran aground. They set up Fort Saint Louis of Texas, near Victoria, Texas. La Salle led a group eastward on foot on three occasions to try to locate the Mississippi.    During another search for the Mississippi River, his remaining 36 followers mutinied, near the site of modern Navasota, Texas. On March 19, 1687, La Salle was slain by Pierre Duhaut, one of four attacking him, "six leagues" from the westernmost village of the Hasinai (Tejas) Indians. The colony lasted only until 1688, when Karankawa-speaking Indians massacred the 20 remaining adults and took five children as captives. Tonti sent out search missions in 1689 when he learned of the expedition's fate, but failed to reach a fort with survivors.

Hope it helps.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Typically, you start with a hard heavy surface that is going to take a lot of energy to get vibrating and chose a material that once vibrating will dampen the vibrations (like sheet rock and not steel plate).  Behind this (and perhaps on the face) you mount absorbent material that tends not to vibrate - cloth or foam or insulation - that can't stand on its own.  If possible you build the two sides of the wall so they are not connected, for example alternating 2x4 studs to make a wall 6 or 8 or 10 inches thick and mount the bottom and top of the studs with rubber isolation so vibrations hitting one wall are not carried through to the other wall.  And all the gaps are sealed with soft material that does not pass air vibrations.    In practice, it is possible to reduce the sound level of a room sharply simply by putting one or two barriers in place.  When I close my bedroom door completely, the sound from my wife reading recordings is reduced over the door being even slightly open.  If two doors are closed in the sound path, like the two in the alcove between the bedroom and the dining room the sound is lowered even more because as sound hits a surface it has to expend energy getting that vibrating and then when the vibrations are carried to the other side, they start as multiple point sources which radiate as the square of the distance.  So if I am 20 feet from a sound source and hearing noise level X, then at a door 10 feet from the source, the sound level would be 4X when open.  But if the door is closed, then first there is the loss getting through the door, suppose half is lost although it is probably more.  But then it radiates by the square law, reducing sharply

So you have the equation, A = P (1+r)^t, where A is the final amount, P is the principal or starting amount, r is the rate and t is time.

Because it only needs to lose 1 electron to form a full outermost valence shell, it will readily lose that electron to attain that status.<br>  <br>  Cl (chlorine) by nature forms -1 anions. Because it only needs to gain 1 electron to form a full outermost valence shell, it will easily gain an electron to gain this status.<br>  <br>  Combining the two elements together in reaction will bond the two ions together, usually done by a double replacement reaction.<br>  <br>  Just remember the rules for charges - Group 1, +1; Group 2, +2; Group 16, -2 Group 17, -1.

gM8GCbyRaa	Net pay is what is left after subtracting all deductions from gross pay. First of all take the 4% off of her pay for the superannuation. So to find how much the superannuation is take .04*2250=90. So subtract that off of the initial amount 2250-90=2160. Subtract off the 72 for medical insurance. 2160-70=2090. Now, for the union fees it's per annum, which is yearly so you have to divide it by 12 to get the monthly amount. So 65/12=5.42 when rounded. Subtract that off of what you have left: 2090-5.42=2084.58. Do the social fees the same way. So 48/12=4. Subtract that 4 off of the amount you still have. So 2084.58-4=2080.58. Then she wants to save 150 per month, so you have to subtract that off: 2080.58-150=1930.58. Then finally you must subtract off the taxes of 407.08: 1930.58-407.08=1523.50. So she keeps $1523.50 a month. Sorry that was so long, hope it helps.

UFteXlqwaa	Well, a high pressure sees the air to sink and clouds to dissolve; hence sunny weather and warm if in the summer. In Norway, e.g. high pressure in the winter means extremely cold days.<br>  <br>  A low pressure means wind and rain and can be expected to be less warm. But it is not always the case if the low brings mild and moist air masses from an ocean over a very cold continental region.<br>  <br>  Then there is the fact that hot air rises and thus sinks the pressure. Cold air, sinks and increases the temperature.<br>  <br>  This can be often see in coastal areas where a sea breeze pattern warms the air above the land during daytime, to create an onshore wind; and warmer sea water during the night, to create an offshore wind.|`|6k8GJBRPaa	Mostly, when it's sunny and hot or cold, there's high pressure.

By reading a question here is what I get:    Your friends father died a few years back when she was just little.  Recently you have been noticing some awkward things happening in your friends house such as objects being moved, very cold areas compared to other temperatures, and strange noises.  If this is the question, here is what I get from it.    There is a great possibility that her father's spirit is occupying the house.  He could come to warn her, or maybe just hasn't reached where he is destined for.  Now of course, your mind can play tricks on you, so you think you are imagining it.  Some advice I give you is play it cool.  What I mean by this is don't get frightened right away or anything.  Pretend nothing has happened that you haven't heard or seen anything.  If you successfully do this and these things are still happening, it's not your mind.     If anything else happens and you need to ask anymore question, please e-mail me or something, I will be glad to help you.|`|ohKKJAi4aa	She probably needs a sensitive to go in and find out what is happening.

Play around with the calculation form at the second link and see what you think.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The whole question of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe comes down to two questions:<br>  <br>  1. How difficult is it for life to come into existence out of non-life.<br>  2. How unique is the Earth's environment and its environmental history in the universe and how necessary was that environmental history to the development of intelligent life (man).<br>  <br>  The first question addresses whether, given the right environment, would it be likely that life would start up anywhere?  We suspect that the answer to that question is: Very Likely.  The reason is that the more we look around the universe the more precursors to life we find.  The more we look around the Earth the more we find evidence that life on the Earth happened very soon after the Earth was created (geologically speaking).  The question of life elsewhere in our solar system is probably the most important question that all of our space exploration is aimed at answering.  We have not found any slam-dunk evidence for life elsewhere but we continue to find places where it could have developed and we continue to look.<br>  <br>  The second question addresses the nurturing of primitive life into complex organisms.  On Earth (our only example of life we currently have) it took over 3.5 billion years to come up with man; three and a half billion years where the environment on the Earth was relatively stable.  For about 3 billion of those years life was mostly single celled.  During this immense time period the environment on Earth was favorable to the continued development of life even in the face of a drastically changing solar environment.  Is it likely that such a planet would exist elsewhere in the universe?  The numbers of stars are staggering so it might seem a virtual certainty that there are “Earth-like Planets” elsewhere in the universe.   Consider this: the Earth has developed life and as far as we currently know Mars and Venus have not.  They are Earth-like planets - very similar planets to the Earth.  The answer must be more complicated than just “Earth-like planets.”<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider: our sun, Sol, has over the last 4 billion years increased its output by about 25% due to normal stellar evolution.  That is an enormous change in output and without some compensating factor the Earth, over that time period, would have gone from an ice ball to a barren Venus like planet.  It didn't- but we don't know what the factor or factors were that maintained such a constant environment.  It is highly unlikely that another “Earth-Like Planet” would have a continuously nurturing environment over a multi-billion year span.<br>  <br>  Now consider the likelihood of the Earth receiving visits from aliens.  The chances of alien life forms visiting us come down to three additional questions.  One addresses the spatial problem and one the temporal problem.  The third addresses actual travel possibilities.<br>  <br>  1. If a technologically sophisticated life form did develop elsewhere in the universe would it be likely that they would be contemporaneous with man when he is also technologically sophisticated. <br>  2. Is it likely that a technologically sophisticated life form could develop near enough to us so that they could reasonably visit the Earth?<br>  3. Does there really exist a “new physics” that would allow travel over immense distances in reasonable times?<br>  <br>  When alien extraterrestrial life is considered what we usually referred to is: technologically sophisticated life.  We aren’t usually talking about bacteria or worms or even Homo Erectus visiting the Earth.  Humans have been technologically sophisticated for only about 100 years with radio communications and rockets. Our first satellite to orbit another body was only 42 years ago. That is 100 years out of a total history for the Solar System of 4,500,000,000 years and of 13,500,000,000 years for the universe.  The chances of a second life form becoming technologically sophisticated and also overlapping in time with man- also being technologically sophisticated seem vanishing small.  Alien civilizations may have come into being, developed and become extinct hundreds of millions of years before or after Earth’s man became technologically sophisticated.<br>  <br>  The problem of travel is also daunting.  With all of our present sophistication we do not have the ability to travel to even the nearest star.  The development of super-sophisticated intelligent extraterrestrial life capable of traveling to nearby stars would first require a nurturing environment existing for billions of years and then the development of science and technology far beyond ours. Put all together- that in itself is very, very, very unlikely.  For intelligent life to happen a second time NEAR enough to our star, Sol, so travel would be possible is vanishingly unlikely.  In talking about alien visitors to Earth there is an implied uncovering of a ‘new physics’ that would allow what our present physics does not allow- travel over large distances in reasonable time frames.  It may be that that physics does not exist.  If you indulge in new physics then you are opening yourself up to creating a fantasy world that may not exist in reality<br>  <br>  Man presently might have the technology and ability to send a man to Neptune.  At the speed of 50,000 miles per hour we would need to provide life support to the astronauts for several years.  It would take 6.4 years at 50,000 mph to go to Neptune – one way.  Now consider the NEAREST star.  At a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour it would take 2,885 years just to get there AND that is only to the nearest star!<br>  <br>  Unless there really is a new physics unknown to man there is essentially no way for aliens to visit the Earth.  If you accept physics as we know it- then there are too few nearby stars for there to be a high probability for the development of technologically sophisticated life forms.  <br>  <br>  Consider this: if the sun were about the size of a golf ball, 1 inch in diameter, the closest approach between Earth and Mars would be about four and a half feet and the orbit of Neptune would be 300 feet away.  At that scale the NEAREST star would be 461 MILES away.|`|0i80jUKeaa	The size of their spaceships is probably somewhat dependent on the size of the aliens themselves, so it would depend on which alien race we're talking about.  Furthermore, it depends on the type of ship - just as humans have small vessels such as helicopters for low-occupancy transportation and large vessels such as Boeing 747's for high-occupancy transportation, so it is with the aliens.  So really, the sizes of their ships could range from anywhere from less than a few feet long to over a kilometer long.|`|8nmi7P6daa	Length: 300.4495869948545996858695868 ft.<br>  Width:388,567,554.559697005948543 ft.<br>  Height:10 in.|`|NBW0jjEsaa	Not as large as you imagination.|`|luYtFLSUaa	If you ever catch or hijack one, let us know|`|WgHIEPvGaa	Our vehicles which we use on Earth, vary by size and transport power.

If for example, we intend to overtake a human body in the 6 foot range, the vehicles may need to be adapted for both size and transport power because of the extra size of the human body, as well as its extra weight factor. Some are very small, only 8 or 10 feet across which carry up to 2 human conversions, other are what you would term as "football field sizes, and even larger, when we need to transport aliens by the hundreds or thousands here or back to the Mother planet.

Our universe is infinite in that we cannot experience its edge or end; exactly the same as an ant crawling on the surface of a very large balloon.  Although the amount of area of the balloon is finite, as far as the ant can experience, it is infinite.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that our universe is curved positively in the fourth spatial dimension.

hgmgH83Xaa	Where humans are concerned, we eat plants and animals, so we're omnivores. There's no such thing as a free lunch in ecology, I don't know if you've ever heard of that before. Or you can't get a 10 lb bag of **** from  51b. bag. Anyway.<br>  <br>  10% rule: As energy moves up a food chain, it is lost. <br>  <br>  A food chain always begins with a primary producer or an autotroph.<br>  That could be a plant or phytoplankton in the ocean (ocean primary producers). The primary producer gets 1% of energy from the sun. It is called a primary producer because it converts energy from the sun and uses it to create its own (glucose/sugar)  food by using carbon dioxide and nutrients from soil. <br>  <br>  So, if the plant got 100,000 calories of energy from the sun, and an herbivore (such as a cow) ate the plant, the cow would get 10% of the 100,000 calories. So, the cow will only gain 10,000 calories from eating the plant. <br>  <br>  A human or carnivore (omnivore, whatever) eats the cow (beef/steak), and then the human will only gain 10% of the 10,000 calories that the cow gained. So, the human will get 1,000 calories from the steak.<br>  <br>  So, energy is lost as it moves up a food chain, which is why vegetarians say, "leave the meet alone, and go straight to the source."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|743f401bac126bdc42eda174751e5d3caa	Only 10% of the energy in a given level of an energy pyramid is available to the consumers.  This limits the number of organisms that can be supported.  <br>  <br>  We can use the energy more efficiently by eliminating some of the levels.
