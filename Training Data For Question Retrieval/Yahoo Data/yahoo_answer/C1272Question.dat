My opinion is, yes bc when its light longer, I normally stay out longer, opposed too when its dark at 5pm, I'm ready to go straight home, you also have to keep in mind there are some people who still do under the speed limit and the price of gas has went down. They wont contribute to the Economy bc they wanna save gas and not go out like they use too.

20090307174617AAxspSE	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	A bird that sits on a golf ball?	Okay, so in biology, years ago we watched a educational video about a certain species of bird.  The bird...I think it looked like a seagull kind of... they traveled in huge flocks and they would stop on little islands in the Pacific.  Well, on islands, there are golf courses.  These birds are genetically programmed to sit on round white "eggs" but they often mistake golf balls for eggs and they will sit on them and guard that golf ball even when a human is walking around really close to it trying to figure out where their ball went.      So my question is this:  what is the name of the species of bird?  I can't remember for the life of me!

20090307174500AAWQwpF	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Parapsychology	How to increase visions?	I guess I have precognitions. When I was younger, I would often (still do, just not as much) have a flash of thoughts, sights, sounds, and feelings blast me out of nowhere. They aren't of important moments usually, just things like walking down a hallway or talking to a friend. Then, what I "see" at that time later happens in a flood of deja vu. I always feel a lot of deja vu when I have a vision, but that's because it's what I feel at the time when it unfolds.       Okay, before I go off on a tangent-   This happens less and less with age, and it is a little saddening. I enjoy my precognitions. My mother has them too and says she began getting them less frequently when she started hitting adulthood herself.      I miss having frequent random visions, then writing them down and anticipating their occurence and all that, the little "Whoaaaa" when they happen.       Meh, has anyone figured out a way to control this (that you yourself has tried?), so I could make them happen more like before? I'm afraid my answer is gonna be no, or they'll be ones that won't work. Or that ESP is bullshit. ;-; But hey, this was worth a shot.         Thanks!

This is the calculation i do:   313 car parks x $20 a day = $6260   $6260 x 365 days = $2284900 This is the amount of money i earn in one year without subtracting expenses. Somehow earning this amount of money in a year seems impossible. What am i doing wrong?   Help Me!

Obviously I'd like to program in one of the above mentioned languages, however I wouldn't mind programming in assembly language or even BASIC (this would be the least favored option, tough). I was told that I should start off with some sort of kit, any recommendations? Nothing too easy please, like Lego stuff or so.   If I was to build a circuit from scratch what kind of hardware would I need? I know I need the actual micro-controller, a power supply and some sort of output, but what else is necessary for a complete working system?      If you could give me some nice links or actually explain the stuff here, I'd be very appreciatedd!      Best regards and thanks in advance,      ~Deimos

20090307175607AAEwJqW	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	What engineering degree do you think?	Computer hardware engineer or renewable energy engineer? What do YOU think; computer hardware engineers are for sure an excellent career choice in things like stability and wages, but OIT recently began the first renewable energy engineering program in the country, so not many universities have it, nor is it well known yet. What do you think, given the state of the economy and the high gas prices and such? Do you think that in the years to come it will be an excellent career choice?
20090307175717AAxQb3S	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Chi-squared analysis - Help present the data below in a suitable diagrammatical way?	Drug trial data -      Recently a clinical drug trial was carried out on a new anti-HIV treatment which increases the rate of healing of 'seeping wounds' of AIDS sufferers. The medical biologists carrying out the trial implemented a 'double-blind' test. A total of 400 people were subjected to the trial, with two groups of equal-size for each medicine. 200 of group A were given the new drug, X, while 200 of group B were given an existing drug, Y.   At the end of 7 days everyone was assessed.   It was found that 24 of those in group A had their wounds healed.   It was found that 14 of those in group B had their wounds healed.

20090307181959AAKze92	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Are Creationism and Evolution complementary?	Let us apply a simple logic...   Since I see, feel and experience the existence of Nature and its constituents around me...all of them must have been created at some point of time.....because nothing can exist unless it is created or formed spontaneously.      Great Thinkers of the past also thought on parallel lines...Whosoever might have created everything....they called the creater as God....God made everything, God desired that way, It is according to God`s wish that this Cosmos came into existence....the way it is and the way   it functions.      This is creationism....It is a perfect logic...nothing wrong about it...      In the dinosaur era or even much earlier, there were no humans, only animals   Hence there was no spiritualism, no God, no religion etc..whatever is connected to the Human thinking.      But those lifeforms at that time were able to procure food for themelves, males and females were knowing how to mate   and reproduce their own species...This was all without the existence of God, because the existence and survival of life forms depended on perfect scientific principles. This appeared to be planned by somebody... designed by somebody...intelligently.      Evolution is based on evidence and proved beyond doubt...But evolutionists should logically think that....for evolving, there has to be something first...they should believe in creation first...      Evolution has been explained scientifically....creation is not yet.         so I feel, are these two concepts, complementary?      ..Gee Waman

20090307182636AAIG5aC	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Chi-squared analysis - Help present the data below in a suitable diagrammatical way?	Website        http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/gro...       On the website above scroll down until you get to the section 'chi-squared: double classifications' about spores. The first table that is presented about the spores is how I want the drug trial data below presented as well.      Drug trial data -      Recently a clinical drug trial was carried out on a new anti-HIV treatment which increases the rate of healing of 'seeping wounds' of AIDS sufferers. The medical biologists carrying out the trial implemented a 'double-blind' test. A total of 400 people were subjected to the trial, with two groups of equal-size for each medicine. 200 of group A were given the new drug, X, while 200 of group B were given an existing drug, Y.   At the end of 7 days everyone was assessed.   It was found that 24 of those in group A had their wounds healed.   It was found that 14 of those in group B had their wounds healed.

Obviously, there are a lot of things I'm running into that I either don't fully understand or disagree with, and would like explained. I've tried posting in some evolution forums, but the people there are so paranoid that I'm some kind of Christian there to preach creationism that they won't even answer my questions, they just insult me and gang up like a high school clique. It's really quite sad. All I need is someone who actually knows what they're talking about to answer some simple questions for me. I don't have time to get a PhD in biology just to answer these questions, and searching online for something overly specific can take hours just to find let alone read. If there's anyone out there who has a very good understanding of evolutionary theory and has an open enough mind to discuss it without any bias, please let me know so I can contact you either via e-mail or chat. Your help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.      Note: By a good understanding of evolutionary theory, I mean you need to know more than the basic theory. I'm going to ask questions about prokaryotes absorbing cyanobacteria in a symbiotic relationship that results in eukaryotes and things along that line, so if that sounds like scientific mumbo jumbo to you, you may not be qualified to answer my questions.

I've been trying to convince my mom to try raw feeding with my 2 dogs because they both have TERRIBLE allergies due to the grains in the kibble they eat (tried raw for awhile without telling her, things improved, but she refuses to believe me). She insists that dogs need fruits, grains, veggies, ect. and that raw would make them sick and they would die (they are still quite alive presently). She has spoken to the vet who insists that all wolves in wildlife sanctuaries are supplemented with kibble because they live longer if kibble fed. I contacted the local sanctuary who has a pack of 10 wolves and they said the wolves get only deer carcasses and live long, healthy lives with no allergies or other problems associated with "domestic" breeds. Does anyone know of a sanctuary that DOES feed their wolves kibble?

So I calculated that the slopes of the three sides of the triangle are as follows...   AB=3/4   BC=-1/2   AC=2      There are two negative reciprocals there, so I figured it was a right triangle, and it is. But my book says that it's a right triangle because the slope of AC multiplied by the slope of BC = -1. I don't get it. Why does that make it a right triangle?

I was so entirely dizzy with vertigo and headaches and shaking that I went to some cheap M.D.   He did not know how to operate the hypoglycemic testing machine.   But by use of it I have determined I do not have low blood sugar. At all. For 3 days I tested it it was within the range of 101-118.   He said also these symptoms could be neurological or heart related.   Or chemical.   But basically the results were supposed to be in on a certain day, but they are going to be 3 days later, does this mean the cheap doctors discovered something? And are experimenting extensively? Or is this just a continuation of their ineptitude?

The strength of gravity is inversely related to the distance something is from the center of a gravitational body's mass. The earth is not completely round. It bulges out around the equator. So, if you are on the equator, shouldn't you be further from the earth's center of gravity thus be a little lighter?      And if so, how much lighter?
