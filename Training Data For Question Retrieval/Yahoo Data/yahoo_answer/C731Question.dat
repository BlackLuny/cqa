20080925105737AAKcZK9	Food & Drink;Entertaining	3 boys (+) 1 BIG family party (+) 3 seperate cake, ice cream partys w friends (=) Everyone's happy?	Does that sound so wrong?   Ages 1,3 and 6. Birthdays are VERY close together followed by Christmas right after.      Do you think it would work out and not seem rude to the family or the boys? We don't mind having three parties but were almost the only people in our huge family with children, everyone else is grown. We don't know what to do. If we invite only the grandparents and aunts then everyone else gets very upset that they were not invited. So we end up having the entire family over all crammed into our not so big house during winter, 3 times in a row. Besides the cost of food and supplies for 3 party's  and presents for the boys. Also Christmas  is a few days later and they deserve a good Christmas also.    We would be able to have cake, ice cream and games with some of there friends over on there birthdays too.    Do you think this would work and make everyone happy, especially being able to have family and friend time for all three of the boys for there special days? It sounds like it would be a lot easier and give the boys a lot more time to be with everyone and have fun! Not to mention it would be less expensive too lol.    Ideas, comments and advice is more then helpful. Thank you very much.
