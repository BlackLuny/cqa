Sure it was gross, but unless the feces got up and assaulted you, you're making a fuss over nothing.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Call a health inspector? I have no idea, but yeah that's nasty and I may call somewhere...head office for Walgreens?    As for the shoes, unless the were sentimental to me and irreplaceable, they'd be in the trash, I couldn't clean them myself.     I get paranoid enough about my own poop and I know where it's been O_O    Alcohol kills just about everything, get rubbing alcohol in the highest percent you see if you're gonna clean them, like use an old toothbrush or something to clean first, then hit them with tons of alcohol.     My nursey friend's motto for dealing with my germaphobic dilemmas is always, "If it dries, it dies" haha =o) The alcohol dries it quickly.     Also, it was probably dog poop, if I had to guess, I'd say dog...I can't imagine a person doing that, unless it was a kid with horrible parents.    I saw a kid poop in a sandbox once, the Mother was horrified though, which was great but didn't help my gagging o_O    Best luck, I gagged reading this in sympathy for your sister haha =o)|`|krKMYVbFaa	Complain to the Walgreen's headquarters.

I'm sure the manager and/or employees did not pull down their pants and take a crap on the floor on purpose.  You were so disgusted, yet you stood there for 15 minutes watching and waiting for it to be cleaned up?  and took pictures?!!!  Give me a break.

Walgreen's didn't poop in the isle so they had no idea it was there until you told them.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	All you can do is to talk to the manager about having the footwear replaced.  If you don't get satisfaction, keep making your way up the food chain.|`|omYoOmSlaa	Devote an old toothbrush to cleaning the grooves of the boots, then throw the brush away. Call the store manager in the morning to explain how frustrated you are with the employee that you dealt with.     They aren't going to buy her a new pair of boots. They will apologize. They will offer some small type of restitution, like a coupon or something. That's about it. If you really want to pitch a fit, and demand that they pay for her boots, they *might* kiss your ***.     If the management doesn't offer a satisfactory apology to you, you may then write a complaint to corporate of the entire experience. I highly doubt the case will go that far. It does stink though, sorry, such is life!|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	I used to work retail and let me say if someone came up to me and told me there was **** on the floor I wouldn't be in a rush to clean it up either.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	How do you not notice a pile of crap? oh well.

Well, let's not exaggerate, as it will ruin your situation and any chance of getting what you deserve.  I am sure the boots could be cleaned...if not with water, then professionally, at the cost of Walgreens.

AA10911602	This would stimulate demand but it would be better if the proviso was made that goods had to be produced in the USA. Even removing the tax would help. The cost is the big thing. If domestic expenditure in the US is $10b a day (and that is each person spending only $5 each) your plan would cost the govt 2.5b each day. A very expensive plan.  Still, with the prospect of unemployment, it may not be enough incentive for many.  You can't take from the rich as these are often the ones who get and keep the economy going.|`|AA11966821	Who is going to pay for this?  What got us into trouble?  Debt -- buying stuff we could not afford, spending tax dollars we have never collected.  What does your "solution" do?  Create humongous piles of debt.  This just makes things worse for a longer period of time.|`|987U0U8Gaa	Tax cuts don't always get used to stimulate the economy. Consumer confidence is so low that it is highly likely people will use the tax cuts to pay off loans and keep in the bank for the hard times ahead.
Kh5o3QCcaa	I am guilty of having  done this.  All women want a nice man who will treat them right.  However I met many that I liked (because they treated me well) but there was just no intimate attraction.  Then I found the nice guy that I was attracted to and I married him.  I think the problem for nice guys is just that.  Women aren't used to being treated right, so when somebody does that, they will be attracted to that, although perhaps not that person.  Why they leave?  Who knows.  I needed that 'spark' quite personally, no matter how nice I was treated.   Not saying it's fair, but I honestly didn't realize it when I was going through it.  And it's definitely not that I didn't care for the 'nice guys', I did very much, but you just can't force chemistry.    Arrogance, you're mean =0[|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Interesting...women always turn into angry lesbians... I did not know that.  When will I turn into an angry lesbian do you suppose?

Somewhere in there, your logic is flawed.|`|OTT79NAtaa	The better question is 'why don't men wise up to this and adjust accordingly'?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I've never done that and I don't know any girls who have so I can't help you there.    I'm with a nice, sweet, supportive guy and have never run off with a jerk or become an angry lesbian. But maybe it's just going to happen one day, right?    These "nice guys" who keep asking questions about why they can't get girls seem to be blaming it on the girls, while assuming they are nice. Maybe you are not as nice guy as you think?     And of course some of the guys who you identify as nice probably aren't that way after they've been with the same person in a relationship for a while and their true colours come out.    Harriet|`|sfn6SpbCaa	 may they don't know what they want.|`|pKnd0jJwaa	notice the lack of women answering this question..  its because they dont know why, its something primal, something instinctive.|`|un0C52G8aa	It's because a lot of those who claim to be nice sweet supportive guys really aren't. They put on those fronts to hide their controlling nature, which they then start to show when the relationship becomes more serious. Woman who have been in abusive relationships will often describe their abusers as being those ways when they first met and that the women fell for them because they were flattered by the interest and attention.|`|8miMWB64aa	It's the contrast between sexuality and mentality.  Many, many women are sexually attracted to activities that they could never bring themselves to realize.    I think RoVale sorta missed the point.  Women do go with jerks, including the ones who claim to be sweet, apparently unable to understand who they selected is a jerk.  I think it's the sexual side that chooses the attraction, and that side seems to pick jerks.    I can't give a biological reason for it (although I can give an evolutionary one).  It just happens.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I thought it was guys that always did that. Actually, people don't get angry, and decide to turn gay.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Of course you mean "why do the women -I know- always do this?"

They grow out of it.|`|CXqXdsK6aa	Typically a guy will just pretend to be that nice guy until he gets her, then he changes to what he really was... but by that time she is already in too deep and her feelings won't let her see the truth.    You'd think they'd be smart enough to recognize this, but they aren't. Everyone can see that guy is no good and lieing to her, but she can't... go figure.    That is... until she is emotionally drained and hurt and can't take it anymore, then she goes on a man-hate and takes it out on the really nice guys, and then they get hurt and come here and make post like this and hate women. And this cycle continues until... the human race is extinct. Or someone grows up.|`|Lh391IV4aa	Alas, hypocrisy is the curse of their whimsical gender.  A more appropriate question would be:  "When will women stop lying to themselves and just accept that they are shallow whores?"|`|9nRMFgaPaa	The reason Jerks get the girls is because they ask them out more and will say what ever they think a girl wants to here because there not interested in honesty or the future if you want a nice girlfriend ask a few out most jerks ask out 10 get one so you will have to do the same and if your dating adult girls ie. over 25 you won't have a problem in the world younger than that girls just want to have fun and not take life too seriously.|`|dROCIoimaa	why do men always do this...?  i can come up with millions of questions like this and im sure you can do it for girls too.  eventually you will find a nice girl that actually likes you that will be all  its just the matter of a girl actually liking a boy   just being a jerk or a nice guy is not enough  i think there are more factors that go into this, than girls just pick jerks  there have been plenty of nice guys that have had girlfriends and have gotten married   so i think everyone has to wait and find someone and stop complaining|`|iqqQLSDDaa	If "women always" did that the human population would have ceased to exist long ago.

Z8qBgv8taa	Paxil helped with my anxiety and I got it from my primary care physician. I don't think that you will be able to get an appointment, get the medication, and have the appropriate effects from the medication in two days though. I would suggest a cold &flu medication that will make you mellow but not too drowsy. Just enough to relax you. Sort of like a drink in a crowd. Hope this gets better.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	my doctor told me that Inderal (sp? maybe Enderal) is supposed to help with this.  he specifically said that people take it before speaking events or performances.  it helps calm you by lowering blood pressure.  of course it has other uses so make sure your doctor knows what other medications you're on.  i take it for migraine prevention.|`|AA10280523	Look up a course in public speaking and speech for long-term. Meds can only help short-term; U need experience and a chance to work out your willies in a safe place before launching into the real world.  Your anxiety is not at all unique. Few people are prepared to assume control, so to speak, of a gathering of people and *hold their interest*.  Practice, practice, practice- good speech is a very useful talent and sets you ahead in many ways.
cHaRg3fkaa	A business that does well all the time, no matter what position a country is on the slope of the economic cycle is casinos.  The only business in the world with a guaranteed profit.    Others, that are winners in a bust, are the vanity industries (e.g., cosmetics, beauty salons, health care oriented towards things like plastic surgery and the like)  as people like to feel good about themselves at all times but more so in bad times.  Education is another one as it allows people to upgrade their skills and knowledge when there are fewer jobs available and once the economy starts heating up they have the skills in demand.  One more is the defence industry - armaments are a hot seller no matter what (as an interesting aside the total amount of foreign aid provided to "developing" countries in a year equals the total amount spent by "developing" countries on weapons!).      Sure you can come up with a few more winners.    Also, you can be a winner if you apply the contrarian principle of investments, namely that when everyone in selling, you buy and when everyone is buying, you sell.

RFJE5TzYaa	Hello,    I remember being 16 just like it were yesterday and honestly you'll come to realize with age that you need to be YOU.  Having to 'act' a certain way is not who you really are as you are trying to be someone you 'think' someone else will like.     In reality, girls like quiet confidence without arrogance.      It's not clothes, it's not what you do, it's not pick up lines, just pure confidence in who you are as a person.    In your question you state you are above average in looks, you say you are 'told' you are talented and you also have a need to find clothes to impress the girls.  This is lack of confidence.    Many of the hottest men in Hollywood are that way soley from their confidence.  They wear simple jeans and a T shirt and they ooze hotness.  Nothing to do with the 'wear'.    Many men whom are not that good looking at all are very 'attractive' in the sense of their amazing confidence!    Start with YOU on the inside.  When you feel good about yourself this will shine to others.  When you love yourself (not in an arrogant way) literally love your inner being, then this will reflect.    When hanging out, and all else fails, ask questions...  Questions spark conversations and conversations lead all kinds of places.  The past, the future, types of foods, movies, family, etc...     Good luck, you on the right track!  (oh to be 16 again...)    ~Alethea    PS be above the influence...dance at raves, stay away from drugs.  It's not worth the risk.  Being above drugs is confidence as well and girls like that, trust me...|`|f9crUDTwaa	You need to learn to be YOURSELF and also learn to be confident with yourself.

Kind of like putting you hand on a hot stove, you don't do it again because you know it hurts.    However in this situation, I feel you need to 'let go' of the past and not let it manifest in your 'now'.  What's done is done, no matter how many times you relive the moment, you cannot change it...    I recommend 'How to Heal Your Life' by Louise Hay.  It speaks how the past can significantly change the present...    ~A
emOhSyY5aa	Yes much harder there is even evidence that they do. Elizabeth Cady Stanton was very racist. She said lost of racist things about black men when black men were allowed to vote. She was enraged and made many racist remarks. In the movie Iron Jawed Angles they wanted the black woman to walk at the back of the march. In the movie it show her walking at the front but in actuality she did not walk at the front with them.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	In a way, yes. Feminism, like most things, is dominated by the people who have the most power: white straight American women. This means that the examination of the intersection of racism classism and sexism is largely absent, and that racist things may be expressed without the white feminists realizing it. They may also take for granted that they are well off financially.    First wave feminism was extremely bad when it came to racial equality. The first feminists specifically excluded black women to court the approval of white men.    This is unacceptable. Feminism must thrive without racism, classism, homophobia, and ablism. Feminists need to include all women. Granted, some racist sentiments are unavoidable, because a white feminist has not been exposed to race. She should, however, when called out on it apologize profusely and educate herself on racial matters in order to avoid the same mistake. Also, the leadership of feminist organizations has to be made up of women from a variety of backgrounds. Otherwise, the dominant perspective will ignore the issues of class and race, and miss a huge part of the picture of the real lives of some women.    But this is the risk that all civil rights movements run. For example, I'm Native American. A ton of Native American movements and celebrations of our culture are too male-dominated. They ignore the experiences of women in our culture, and do not include our views.    That's not to say that civil rights movements are thus irrelevant or bad. But steps need to be taken, especially by the women that dominate the feminist movements (like the editors of Ms Magazine or the leaders of NOW) to make sure that they are including the needs and views of women from all backgrounds.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	I dont think their is much black feminist. Most feminist I've seen were ugly, butch men haters.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	1) are you high?    2) you make no sense - there are feminists of all colors    3) again, you make no sense    OK really - you are just trying to stir up shlt (or you live in the sticks somewhere). Im in Michigan and women do not have it so bad anymore (and no, I am not rich - but maybe a little bltch). Granted there are still morons out there, there always will be. Most supervisory positions where I have been employed have been occupied by successful BLACK women (thats right, not men, not white girls. but these women are intelligent, organized, and focused in their careers and themselves) The people who bltch and complain about other people not doing enough for them are the ones who will not get anywhere in life because they do not help themselves! You whine and complain about no handouts, well GOOD, you dont deserve them...people (any people, white, black, green, women, or men) who are dedicated and work for what they want are the only people who deserve to be at the top. I have had enough of lazy, ignorant losers sitting around blaming everyone else for their misfortune. You dont like something - YOU CHANGE IT.|`|Pnhkh7eiaa	Right now, I think that a black woman is probably the easiest thing to be.  If anyone ever does anything against you, you can sue them for both racism and sexism!  Think of the possibilities.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Well I am Asian but I know how it can be in certain feminist groups.  Mainstream feminism (like mainstream anything else in the West) is really centered on white folk...so racism does come into it.  Plain and simple.   And most of the problems that get the most attention are the problems faced by the richer white women...same thing with how the gay movement usually focuses on richer white gay dudes and not say poor black transwomen.    Also, some white women can see all that sexism does and how people dismiss it, but when it comes to race they do the same **** they get angry at men for doing!

This information interprets as such:   A change in age, dietary habits and informational influences are the figure you can't see and the reason you cant see it because it is a large amount of information and the brain feels it unnecessary to use up the amount of energy required to create a specific series of visuals for that amount of information so a figure of recognition will suffice.   The walking away represents the information you know but haven't fully processed as part of you yet, and the part of you running after him is the image of you attempting to process the loads of info being gathered.

Here's the actual Equal Pay Act:  http://www.eeoc.gov/types/epa.html    The reason the latest Fair Pay law was passed was because the Supreme Court ruled that a woman who found out after 30 years that she'd been paid less than the men working around her with less or the same skills, had to have found out about the pay difference within 6 months of being hired. Most ppl have no idea what anyone makes around them ever, let alone in 6 months. It made gender discrimination law suits useless.    FYI: Many women have started their own businesses so they didn't have to deal with the sexism in their profession. But they have not made them women-only, as they aren't sexist, like the companies they escaped from.      Have you heard of a union? They were started because men were being treated unfairly at their jobs as well.|`|OTT79NAtaa	'Because the world has always been like that from day one'    - and is that sheer coincidence, that the `WHOLE WORLD` has been that way from day one?|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Ask any black man who's been discriminated against.

Women's careers are also disrupted by starting families, so they have less work experience than otherwise equivalent men.

So that's where it comes from.  Most of the pay gap that's left today is a result of differences in jobs, not equal pay.  It's like saying McDonald's workers are getting unequal pay because they make less money than Peyton Manning does.  You can't compare the two.  If companies could really get away with paying women less than men, they'd be stupid to hire men for most jobs.  It would be a bad business decision.|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	IMO the free market should decide this answer not the government.  I think it comes down to negotiation techniques or maybe men are just more aggressive so they fight harder for the extra dollars.    Another point, if there's a woman with less experience because she spend several years at home with the kids, then she might be offered less money because of the experience part of the equation.  If the government steps in and tries to regulate that, then the company might just pick someone else (possibly a man) with more experience.    shew....its fun trying to write this without offending.  yahoo answers on egg shells.  YIPPIE!|`|WKyPDbglaa	Basically feminist's want to do away with seniority and a merit based pay system. There is no wide spread discrimination against women, but feminist's think a female pediatrician should make as much as a male neurosurgeon.            That time of law would only be used to benefit women who work part time and hurt men's wages across the board because companies would be too scared to give men raises no matter how much they earned them.          Even though it is against the law there are women only companies, doctor offices and Law Firms. Further evidence that feminism is a sexist female supremacy ideology.

Therapists are meant to make you feel wonderful. :3|`|BycbT5Reaa	Talk to your therapist about it, of course.|`|tveAgF0aaa	Go to a therapist (not your mom).|`|cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	This is actually a fairly common problem. I don't mean to minimize your problem in the least, but wanted you to know you're not alone. Patients often end up thinking of the therapist as a parental figure. This is usually considered transference. I don't think that's always the case, but I'd say it often is to a certain degree. Wiki describes transference this way, "Transference is a phenomenon in psychoanalysis characterized by unconscious redirection of feelings for one person to another. One definition of transference is 'the inappropriate repetition in the present of a relationship that was important in a person's childhood.'[1] Another definition is 'the redirection of feelings and desires and especially of those unconsciously retained from childhood toward a new object.'[2] Still another definition is 'a reproduction of emotions relating to repressed experiences, esp[ecially] of childhood, and the substitution of another person ... for the original object of the repressed impulses.'[3]"    While many people would say these are innapropriate feelings, which would coincide with one of those definitions up there, I am not about to make the value judgement that it's inappropriate. Some might, but I'm more lax about such things.    What I will say is that, while you may really like your therapist- genuinely like them- and think they'd make a good parent, chances are this is somehow related to the mother that raised you adn your relationship to her. Part of this is prob. you redirecting your need for a mother, and maybe feelings you had or have for her, onto someone else that you think might be able to better fill the role of mother, if she has refused to be a good mother to you, OR if she has passed away and is no longer able to be here for you in a corporeal form.    Some people put their feelings for one person onto another who doesn't even deserve those judgements and feelings. Maybe treating a therapist as though they were their abusive father, when the truth is, the therapist isn't abusive in the least. As an example, wiki mentioned this, "  It is common for people to transfer feelings from their parents to their partners or to children (cross-generational entanglements). For instance, one could mistrust somebody who resembles an ex-spouse in manners, voice, or external appearance; or be overly compliant to someone who resembles a childhood friend." Yet, I am not saying you are making false judgements about the therapist or that none of your feelings for her are genuine. Maybe you really do see her as she is and your feelings for her are because you really like her for her, and maybe those feelings aren't completely about your relationship with your mother. YET, at the same time, my guess is, since you want her to fill that role so badly, at least if you aren't thinking about her as being like a second mom, but you actually want her to be your mom, then.....I'm betting you either don't think your mom is there for you now, or you didn't feel like she was as you were growing up.    I think kids need parents. Not just the supervision or the basic necessities provided- but kids need bonding and love, and when they don't have that or when they lose that, it creates a hole in their lives and hearts. They feel that need to have a family that loves them. And not just a family of their own with a spouse and kids, but a family with parents. If you never got that, it's no wonder you seek it out in others. If you did get it, but you lost it, it also stands to reason you'd want to fill that hole. A relationship with a therapist can be emotionally intimate, close, protective, and nurturing, so it can cause one to feel close to their therapist emotionally, and also it can cause them to see their therapist as a caring nurturer and protector (like a good parent), as well as a friend and confidant.    I think you should tell your therapist about this and discuss your relationship with your mother, or lack therof, and how you view your mother. What do you feel like you are missing, or missed? Then you can address healing from this loss. I wish you luck.
QAtpLEEFaa	From your other answers you've obviously got a lot of talent in other academic  subjects and a great abilility to communicate  abstract ideas.  Today (even before the economic downturn)it's pretty difficult to get a career based only on a first degree.  So have you considered  getting a diploma or second degree in educationand getting into the teaching profession?  Alternatively  there are still quite a few jobs overseas teaching English as a second language (we're lucky in that that our language has become a commodity)  If you want to use sociology  - then there is no career there unless you:   a) demonstrate research skills which means getting a Masters or a   Ph D.  b) get some other career oriented diploma or degree eg teaching /business studies/administration/counselling/etc which has associations with sociology  However with the present recession even this path is tricky now.    I agree that life is scary now ... and this economic downturn will take at least a couple of years.  So would you be able to live a double life, in keeping a job to finance further study  or maybe higher research.  Because by now you've lived long enough in the tough world of working people to have got an insight that creates sociological gold i.e  a good research question that could become the basis for a PhD .    nb the occupational areas that are likely to grow in the next decade are in the correctional services and in the aged care  field..your degree could be useful there.
4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I have my clients identify the "old tapes" that keep them stuck.  They identify where the message came from, what the tape sounds like and what it does to them when they play it in their head.  The person has to make a conscious decision that he / she wants to actually get rid of the message (becausae that person also has the right to keep it if they feel they want to).  Finally, I have the client identify a "replacement tape" that he / she believe would be healthier for them.  Again they have to identify what the specific message is, and I ask then to write it down.  Finally I help them practice the new message.  I take the role of the old tape and talk the old messages to them, while they practice stopping the old message with the new one.    Does that help?|`|RFJE5TzYaa	Greetings,    I do not know the method  used but I've heard of similar...    Basically the mind 'learns' to react certain ways.  For instance a smell of a perfume can trigger pain and thoughts of a past relationship.    A date can trigger anger from a past event...    The key is to understand you can not change the past.  What is done, is done.  No matter how much you 'rewind' the tape and listen to it over and over, and dwell over and over and FEEL over and over, it is not going to change.    You simply have to forgive and move forward. This is the hard part, letting 'go' of the past.  It sounds that this 'tape' method would work that when you recognize past 'recordings' surfacing, you press the stop button on thoughts to acknowledge the past, cease the thoughts, and replace the thoughts with the new 'tape'...    For a happy, fulfilled life we must live in the 'now'.  I recommend the book 'Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle...    ~A

eBMKmgCjaa	Of course they should be shut down, but in the current climate, any act by women against men is too often greeted by 'You go girl'. As far as I am concerned, kidnapping or violence should be greeted with 'You go to jail, girl'.    Also the people who use positions of public office (e.g. Harriet Harman in the UK government) to promote prejudice and discrimination against men should be shut down too http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pol...

These feminists have gone too far!!!|`|WKyPDbglaa	Further evidence that all feminist's are dangerous criminals.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	The difficulty of making such a snap decision is that these type of organisations are providing much needed escape routes for women and children who are abused. It could be the case that the woman has lied to the organisation and that they were all to ready to accept the lies. If Kobra is a genuine NGO helping women with problems it shouldnt be shut down. What should happen is that government money should be only given to the organisation so long as an intensive regulation regime is introduced to stop misjudgements. It could be said that the majority of women in these organisations, either by way of their work or initial beliefs, are sexist against men. If this is the case they should be trained to be more accepting and also should be encouraged to offer the same service to men in the same situation or indeed children.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	Plenty of men kidnap kids when they're not the custodial parent.  Ever seen the film "Not Without My Daughter"?    "In this docudrama based on true events, a mid-'80s Michigan housewife finds her life turned upside down when a vacation to Tehran with her Iranian husband turns into virtual imprisonment for her and her young daughter. Betty Mahmoody (Sally Field) is reluctant to visit the wartorn homeland of her doctor husband, Moody (Alfred Molina). But, depressed about the racism of the American medical establishment and pining for contact with his family, Moody convinces her to join him for a two-week jaunt. The Islamic fundamentalism and strange customs of Iran bewilder and frighten Betty and her daughter, Mahtob (Sheila Rosenthal). But nothing prepares her for Moody's announcement that the family will be remaining in Tehran indefinitely. Despite beatings and more pervasive psychological control from her husband and his relatives, Betty makes it to the Swiss embassy (there is no American ambassador at the time). There, she learns that as the wife of an Iranian, she is now automatically considered a citizen and that she has absolutely no parental rights over Mahtob in this country. Betty then endures several years as a virtual prisoner, escaping only with the help of Westernized Iranian friends. Based on the book by the real-life Mahmoody and William Hoffer, Not Without My Daughter was coincidentally released during the long build-up to 1991's Gulf War."      Chew on that awhile.|`|mtcTRXNBaa	They should be put into workcamps so for once in their pathetic lives, they actually do something useful to society.|`|8miMWB64aa	If the allegations are true, yes.

There will be people who lie and rape the system. That doesn't mean the system isn't necessary and more beneficial than not.    I don't know of this group, but what i read makes me think that there is a lot of good that can be done through them.     False accusations are terrible, but the problem is real. Children are abused, a safe parent should have places to turn when they need to get their kids out of an abusive situation. If they have nobody, these groups are an excellent option.     In this specific case, since it says the mother was deemed unfit, then obviously it makes her accusations pretty suspicious.    Just because of this i don't think there's any reason at all to slam all organizations that help a safe parent 'kidnap' their child/ren and get them to a safe place away from an abusive parent.     If this organization is only helping people make false claims, then of course that would be a worthless organization, but I really doubt that's their mission.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	All feminist organizations that leech tax-payer's money should be abolished.    @green6es, we're talking about feminist hate-groups here not deranged individuals.|`|rpajoT0raa	What? This article doesn't say anything about any feminists or feminist movements except for what some aggrieved father and a blog supporting him is claiming without any articulated proof.    Besides. A major reason for the feminist movement is to give women the equal legal rights as men to voice their political, social and moral views without being "shut down", thrown into an asylum or burned at a stake for it.     You don't have to agree with every feminist. I don't agree with everyone, either. But you should just respect that she has as much freedom as you do to express an opinion.     If you can't take the heat and argue rationally when discussing social current affairs and feminist issues, then go play some ballgames in the park instead.    Edit-  Jose, it's just an opinion of someone's which has been printed in a newspaper. Do you believe everything that anyone says in a newspaper? An organisation which exists to protect abused women and children, and which is supported by government, must have some merit.... and it's stupid to start brandishing pitchforks and torches just because a frustrated person in a newspaper says the "F" word.     Attack the organisation's actions in this case if you wish - and if you think you know all about it other than what some guy is saying in a newspaper then you may even have grounds to think they should be disbanded - but it's stupid for people here to attack "feminism" over it.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	The police are investigating it.  I am confident that it will be sorted out.  There are accusations of abuse against the father, although I think that this not the way to go about dealing with them.  I'd like to know more - like why are the children with the father, instead of with the mother.    If it is just a desire to have her children with her, at any cost, I think it is wrong.    Edit:  "Not without my daughter" was based on a true story.  It will be investigated.
S8BCApc5aa	Often times, self-injury is a coping mechanism people develop after extreme physical and/or psychological trauma. The two most likely culprits here are stress and dissociation - let me explain.    Stress is obviously present in anyone who has endured something like molestation. The pain of the past causes anxiety, fear, and sometimes anger as well. The act of cutting yourself causes your brain to release hormones, like endorphins, to minimize the actual pain that you feel. Endorphins don't just work for physical pain - they can be very calming as well. Also, cutting yourself is a bit like hitting your fingers with a hammer because your leg hurts - it shifts the focus of the mind from one pain to another. When dealing with extreme trauma, it is likely that physical pain is actually preferable to mental pain for some people.    The other big possibility is dissociation. This is when you have feelings of isolation, numbness, or loneliness - the feeling that things are "unreal." In this case, self-injury is a means to make the person feel as though they are alive, that they can feel reality, and to connect with their surroundings again.    Neither of these are good or healthy reasons to cut yourself. You should get help - I'm not saying you're crazy or insane (going through such trauma, it would be a natural reaction for some people), but I AM saying that cutting yourself is an extremely dangerous practice that can cause severe medical problems and even unintentional death. Infections are possible as well.    In short, cutting yourself is probably a reaction to the feelings you have from significant trauma. It's not uncommon - it's just not healthy.|`|JtUuMdRKaa	um... i'm not sure but i think it just made you sad because i don't think you wanted this (i could be wrong but i just have to go with that assumption for now) so it made you sad and now ur depressed and u feel like maybe cutting yourself will make u feel better? i hope i helped!!!|`|dDhMadf4aa	depression maybe...you feel bad about it and its your fault when its not its the sick molestors so dont cut yourself look for the positve things|`|AFAegaNGaa	This is a tuff question/ dream to answer for obvious social fears of someone thinking your cold when you're not attempting to be but here goes.   You cut yourself because you have chosen not to accept the fact that certain aspects of the physical touching, while criminal, were to some degree pleasurable to your flesh.   Now denial will be your first responce but when you choose to accept the fact that your flesh sensory receptors are designed for such things, meaning to find pleasure in a touch, the cutting may stop.   The cuts represent your denial of such things.   While I do not condone that which happened to you, it is no sin or ill on your part to have, even if just once, felt pleasure.   No matter how brief that moment may have been.   What you must do now is to accept the facts of what happened, you're not alone in there overall experiences, and any pleasure that may or may not have been experienced are natural based upon your biological responce sector of your feminine creature.   Quit denying facts about the real and the fantasy of it all, accept it as the past and move on for by cutting yourself you continue to relive that which was part of your person then but is now only a part because you are freely choosing to let it still live.   You are you now, not then so it is time to let YOU be the youNOW and use the you of yesterday as a guide to a better life tomorrow.   New note in responce:   As I said before, denial will come first.   I am not saying that YOU as a female found pleasure in it, I am stating the fact that your body has receptors designed specifically for arousal and often times in these cases the victim abuses themsleves because the pleasure and the acts envolved aren't what is desired by said victim.   As a former criminal investigator for the Dept. of the Army, I can tell you with a clear mind that when it becomes evident to the victim that what has been said here is factual, the self abuse often stops permanently because the need for denial is over, no longer a necessity.   Just because a part of your bilogical design did what it was supposed to do, doesn't mean it's sick or gross or anything like that, in fact, it is a clear indicator that your responces are normal to similar behaviors of the sexual kind.   When you get the idea of "that's gross" out of your head, which in itself is disassociation of the facts at hand, then you can see with open eyes that cutting doesn't take away that which happened and that you're okay as a female and can move on to the present.   Again, the cutting only represent an attempt to associate those acts with something other than a biological responce of pleasure so you exert pain into the equation to reinforce that mindset that it is gross that pleasure was felt by the brain ( NOT BY THE YOU).   You are not the sum of just your thoughts and responces to them but rather a a whole of the whole and cutting will not stop what happened nor your biological responces to it.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Self-injury like cutting is often an outcome of being sexually molested or being abused in other ways.  For the most part, it does several things for the cutter.  It takes difficult emotional pain and turns it into physical pain.  The cutting acts like a release for the person.  The cutting is often a means to get attention and sympathy.  Finally, the cutting is also indicative of low self-esteem.  The cutting reinforces to the cutter that they are worthless and deserving of being scarred.    Now, you can't figure out everything by yourself.  You can't be objective because you are emotionally involved with yourself.  Get to a counselor ASAP and start working on this issue.|`|85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	it might have. but is it really that you hate yourself? or is it that you have low self esteem? or you don't know how to handle the pain? im sorry that happened to you. try to get some help if you want to =]|`|twZI4VkHaa	A lot of cutters are depressed and they are depressed for many reasons, and your reason may be that you were sexually molested. Cutters seek a way to get "rid" of the pain the feel which resorts to self-mutilating(i.e cutting). I think the best way to stop is to talk to someone about it whether it be your parents or a therapist. I think talking about it will definitely help you out. You should understand that it's not your fault and you shouldn't blame yourself. It's the person who molested you who has the problem and is sick in the head. So don't ever blame yourself.     I hope everything goes well for you and you should definitely get help.  Good luck.|`|AtezC7HQaa	Well to tell you the truth I was...uh... well you know by my uh... a parent, and I was only three years old, then I ended up in foster care, got out of it at age eighteen, I'm nineteen now and I live with A$$ hole not grand grand parents and they care nothing of me. Basically I have never even thought of cutting my self and I have never tried it nether. I think what u need is to talk to a friend or someone u trust, and some one who will not tell someone you DON"T trust, so talk to a friend and let them know the... uh details, although it may be hard to you must NOT hold what you feel and what happened to you inside it will only eat you inside and you'll never get better. I hope you find some one you trust.
cWxwHMQWaa	I don't at all agree with your terms here.     A woman who doesn't look like a scrub shouldn't be getting goobers trying to dry hump her just because she's not pug fugly, no. That's creepy.    Women who dress 'provocatively' though, then definitely being given a lot of attention is invited.    For women who are dressed 'normally', but took the time to pick something nice, do hair, do makeup...compliments and looks are nice, but for the guys who act the same way as if she had a short skirt and cleavage that nearly exposed the nipple...it's just ******* weird.    You seem to think any woman who cares how she looks is 'inviting' lots of attention, I can't say I agree.     This comes from a woman who says women getting honked at and catcalled while wearing provocative clothes definitely has invited it. So I'm not one of these, "Women should dress any way they like and always be treated with dignity and respect because they're women!" kinda pylons.     This entire question made you sound pretty pervy and like you weren't properly socialized =o/    Can't put my finger on exactly why though, hmm. The over all tone though was just definitely...not normal to any man I've ever encountered...even on here.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Some women seem to feel that doing hair and makeup is just part of getting dressed and ready to go.  Like, would you go out in the morning without changing out of your pajamas or brushing your teeth?  Something like that - a basic grooming procedure.  I don't think we should all have to go out looking as slovenly as possible to try to avoid impolite advances.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	Personally I like to feel pretty, hence all the make-up, bells, and whistles.  I don't see a problem with guys looking, but blatantly staring me down like Im a t-bone steak and they haven't eaten in a week is uncalled for.  That's is not what I'm seeking.  I shouldn't have to leave the house looking like I just rolled out of bed to be respected?  And as mentioned above not even that would necessarily solve the problem.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Attractive women is what men want.  And if we do go out unattractive looking, then people get freaked out.

There's no legitimate reason for anyone to pay that much attention to me unless I'm actually saying something.

Sexist or not, I think many women are very conflicted on sexuality; the contrast between wanting to be treated as an equal and wanting to be spanked.|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	It doesn't matter what a woman is wearing.  Being a woman will get stares and whistles.      There was this one time I got off from work and it was raining out.  I had my umbrella down low to keep as dry as possible while trying to cross a street.  A male driver went as far as opening his car door and angled his body so he could see me under my umbrella.    It's gets pretty cold where I live, so in the winter I use my scarf to cover my face.  You think that stops men from staring or beeping their horns?!  Nope!            "...Besides which you are blaming women for someone else's rude behaviour."- EXACTLY!|`|AA11328275	Why the heck are you asking why women put on make-up instead of asking why the heck the men act like undisciplined heathen animals and are so frickin' disrespectful.

I don't mind the attention I attract, as long as it's respectful.  If I'm not in the mood, I'll let you know.    Maybe you are catching women at a bad time. Long hard days at the office, home, kids, etc. She may look the part but not feelin it....|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Because of course they want attention, they're just ashamed to admit it.

I do care however if an absolute stranger walks up to me and asks me to "spend the night at his place". I can't think how that would be considered acceptable behaviour.    Besides which you are blaming women for someone else's rude behaviour. That would be like a guy saying "well if that other male didn't want me to goose him he shouldn't have been wearing nice pants".|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Women make themselves attractive because we're always in competition with other women.   Consciously or unconsciously, she wants to always be the best choice to an available male.  It's primal and we can't help it.|`|4Sp8esZOaa	I have no problem with the attention, but when some strange guy comes up to me asking me thing he shouldn'tt and touching me I then get angry... but as long as they know how to talk to a girl in an apporate way its fine with me|`|AA10652010	It depends on what you mean by looking attractive. If a woman gets dressed nice puts on makeup and heels it doens' t mean she's looking to get hit on. She's just wanting to look nice and feel good about herself.   If you mean why do some women put thier boobs on display and then get mad at men for looking at them. That's different. I don't know. Maybe it's like you said . They just get mad at the ones they aren't interesed in.   Or maybe they want to have men find them attractive, but  maybe don't want to be leared at. Men can show they find a woman attractive without learing at her.   -Completely faultless? So you're saying she has some fault in getting raped? No it is not a women's (or anyones) fault if she gets raped. She may be stupid for getting drunk at a frat party to the point of passing out. But that's it. It doesn' t give anyone the right to touch her. Poor judgement is no excuse for any crime.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	The choice to be a pervert, harasser, rapist, or abuser is exactly that, a *choice*. For the record, the most violated I've ever been was when I was very young and I was groped on a bus by a much older man who held me against the wall and put his hands down my pants. It was 20 degrees outside and I was wearing my track jacket and my track pants. My hair was a mess I wasn't wearing makeup, and I was going home from practice. I probably didn't exactly smell like daises.    Let's put it this way: I could be passed out naked and drunk in a frat party. If they were decent guys, they would make sure I was okay and that I didn't have alcohol poisoning. If they were criminals, they'd rape me. The only factor that really separates illegal actions from other action is the presence and choices of criminals.    Edit: excuse me, there is no legal "punishment" for poor judgment. Likewise, there is no excuse for crime. You can't punish the stupid, and you can't legitimize those that exploit them. Going out with friends whenever I please and getting a bit tipsy is my *right*. Not being raped is my *right*. Being able to seek justice when I am raped is my *right*.
vAdtlZDpaa	Recurring dreams happen because your subconscious wants to relay a message to you. Even though you didn't have the same exact dream, your dreams had the same themes - of being in a situation where you were helpless and died as a result.     Dreams about death indicate the end of a phase in your life, or the loss of some aspect of your waking life (your youth, for example).     In the first dream, you sink into water and drown. That dream indicates that your loss came about as a result of overwhelming emotions, which are symbolized in our dreams by water, as Leon said.     In the second dream you are surrounded by a group of people, which symbolizes many different aspects of your personality. However, none of those people come to your aid. In that dream, your loss comes about as a result of being suffocated, which could indicate feeling suffocated emotionally in real life.  You are unable to save yourself because you don't want to "drop the baby", which could mean that you do not want to let go of some part of your personality that you believe is "pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted".    Often vivid dreams indicated feelings that we have repressed or not acknowledged in waking life. Although you say you have no major stress in your life, it sounds like you are out of touch with some feelings that you have about some transition or loss in your waking life that is really bothering you subconsciously.|`|37QEg4vxaa	well since your a mother i can understad the baby thing.. you would rather give your life so your baby can live.. you may have not known the baby in the dream but thats just like the people you knew in the dream but didnt know in real life... now the swimming dream... did you watch any TV before you whent to bed about water or drowning... if so then thats why lol|`|aLzymSxraa	Just because you have no major stress doesn't mean that there are things that you put in the back of your mind to deal with on at a later time.     If it isn't that perhaps it's your children. Do you watch out for them? Are you afraid that protecting them may hurt you in any way? Are you overprotective?    What about the past? Has there been any bad swimming sessions that you regret?    All I can say is that if this is really bugging you, look within yourself! why? because you are the one that has the answers!    Find someone you trust, sit them down, and just talk things out. not just about the nightmare but whatever else that may bother you.     if none of this works just simply shrug it off as a bizarre dream and get on with life.|`|Skh7cmOKaa	You mean to tell me that you're a married mother of 5 and u have no major stress? That's either a blessing or a lie! LOL! This dream seems to remind me of a dream I once had years ago. I figured it out to mean that there is some type of emotional stress you ARE going through right now. Rather subconsciously or consciously. But because of the fact that you died in your dream and didn't panic shows that you are going to make it through your stressful time. Also, you were holding a baby, this means something or someone new is coming into your life-GOOD FORTUNE! And when you became smothered and died again you woke in a panic this time. Which means learn to handle these stressful times cause it can affect your health-heart, mind, and emotions. Take care of yourself, if you're a believer-pray, and if you haven't gone to the doctor lately -go-just to make sure you have dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's!!! Good Luck and stay Blessed!|`|7uimzAn8aa	To dream that you are on the docks, suggests that you have successfully gotten through some tough times and emotions. Considering that you are under them suggests you haven't got past them just yet.    To dream that you are drowning, indicates that you are feeling overwhelmed by emotions or repressed issues that are coming back to haunt you. You may be proceeding too quickly in trying to discover your unconscious thoughts. You should proceed more cautiously and slowly. If you drown to death, then is refers to an emotional rebirth. If your survive the drowning, then a waking relationship or situation will ultimately survive the turmoil.    To see a baby in your dream, signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings. Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted. If you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential. If you dream that you forgot you had a baby, then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities; You do not want to let others know of your weaknesses. If you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby, then it signifies your issues of dependency and your desire to be completely care for. Perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility. If you are pregnant, then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes.    I hope this helps, any more questions feel free to contact me.

Then of course, this is yahoo answers, you'll get a lot of people who just like to attack other people on the internet.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	Yes i would.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I am a believer that feminists focus on women's rights and women's treatment in society.  I base this off what they do and say, not what some dictionary says.      I am in no way saying that many feminists don't want equal treatment between men and women (although some clearly don't, and if you can't see that you are either lucky you haven't run into them or simply aren't willing to admit it).  I definitely don't agree with a lot of the garbage that gets posted on here.  But I have been told flat-out by more than a few feminists that even if I believe in equal rights between the sexes, if I don't go out and actively help women, I am not a feminist.  That is what I base my thoughts off of, feminists' own words.  Also, when you bring up some inequality men face, it will either get explained away, ignored, or be something that is a man's problem and therefore we should do something about it.  Which I agree with the last point to an extent-except for two things:    1. Like it or not, feminists would never have been able to pull off most of what they did without the help from men, particularly in the early days.  Expecting men to help you and then not helping them in return is nothing short of hypocrisy.  2. Feminists are the one saying they're fighting for equality, which means fighting for both sides.    Just based off the dictionary definition, I am a feminist.  But most feminists wouldn't consider me one even though I believe in equality.  How do you explain that?  I'm sure it's probably because I disgree with your "average" feminist much more often than not on most political issues and some social issues, but that's not supposed to be the point is it?    I'm not against feminism per se, it did some good things in the past and occasionally it still does, but I don't think they have some high moral ground over the rest of us like some of them act.    If it were only about equality, I'd support it, unless there was some real reason not to.  There are a few things in which men and women simply can't be treated equally, particularly health issues.|`|DpbZdIsUaa	Yes I agree with equality, however everyone has their own definition of this.  I know I'm not strong enough (and never will be), to do some of the work that men do but my neice has a different opinion to me, she believes she can do anything that a man can do.  She is a lot more physical than I am and is alot stronger than I am.  I'm not interested in going out into the bush and killing a pig or any other animal whereas she thinks it great!  We both agree that there should be political, economic and social equality, because nothing should be only for one gender to do or work on.  It is up to the individual person not the individual gender!|`|QTclwMgXaa	That definition of feminism is like a picture of your grandmother in high school.  She hasn't looked like that in decades.  Neither has feminism fit that definition in decades.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	I whole heartedly support equal opportunity.    Yet i despise what feminism stands for.    Edit:*** What I mean is that feminism is not about equal, but rather SPECIAL , rights , rules, laws , programs , opportunities and subsidies that benefit women ( and only women).  It's not about "equal" , but "Special" opportunity.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	That's what it is about. Anti-feminists are just not critical enough to take that statement to the logical conclusion and apply it to reality, or they are unwilling to realize that some of the assumptions they hold are extremely sexist.    The inability for others to realize that feminism has never deviated from the above, even in the radical realms, is their failing, not feminism's. If you ignore the indoctrination and irrational fear of feminism and are willing to rid yourself of sexism, it's really quite logically apparent that the above is truly what all forms of feminism is.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	If it means enforcing quotas or affirmative action in order to achieve any of these goals (something my own country HASN'T needed to do to achieve these goals) then no. If feminists can't help women without trying to drag men down in the process, then feminism deserves to be suffocated to death.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Sounds good to me. That's what I thought too.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No. Based upon this reasoning let's say that I come across an ariticle that says men were allowed to beat and or kill their wives; I could find evidence contrary.  Let us say that feminism claims women were prisoners in their home and the men were this and that I could find evidence supporting the contrary.  No.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I already do. That's what real feminism is about.
4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	You definitely need to see a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner to see if meds could help you.  Perhaps several things are going on.  Depression is often accompanied by anxiety, so what you describe doesn't surprise me.  I would encourage you to apply for public assistance and insurance.  Make sure you have Title 19 coverage.  You may have to be assessed for am SMI determination to get you in to be seen for meds.  Check to see what the agency is in your state that can help you with this.  I wish you well with this.|`|Wy47JwOQaa	I would recommend seeing a Counselor or Psychologist.  The Psychiatrist/pills route didn't work for you.  See someone who can help you process your thoughts and actions and guide you on how to change the parts of you that you are not thrilled about.    As for what should you do?  I would recommend starting an Internet business.  Learn Internet Marketing, start doing some Affiliate Marketing projects, and start earning an income while sitting at home alone in front of your computer.  Safe, no conversations, and money coming in.  Pretty freakin' perfect, right??     Best of Luck!  :-)|`|JMieQrgXaa	What is wrong with you, well i think you know that very well you just wrote a paragraph on it, and what can you do, well as your title says it...find psychiatric help.|`|livX6UG1aa	For your anxiety, try listening to Eli Bay's progressive relaxation. It is a CD you can buy. It has empowering breathing, and then with the progressive relaxation, you relax every muscle in your body by tightening it, and then letting go.     Once you practice it enough, you'll be able to do something like clenching your fist, and you will feel instantly relaxed (it takes a LOT of practice though!)    If you can get to a psychiatrist, do, but they can run hefty costs if you are not currently on insurance.     Aside from that, at least make use of any close friends, not to depend on, but to talk to when you need support.     For the nervousness talking to people, try smiling. Smile all the time, even if it's forced, because when you smile on the outside you will eventually smile on the inside. (This is because if you force yourself to ACT or Fake happy, you have to THINK happy, and if you THINK happy, you'll feel happier... I don't know how it works exactly!)     I hope this helps!   Nothing is wrong with you, you're just having a rough patch!   Don't let anxiety get the best of you!!!   best of luck!|`|k0x99dGraa	Since you don't have insurance getting psychiatric help will be difficult and depending on the area you live in it maybe hard to find free psychiatric help. I think the best option would be to research free health clinics, or health clinics for students... or even call your old psychiatrist and see what they recommend.
5vcd7GHNaa	Lol, here's what I do:    I put on 2 covers. Yes two, but not on top of each other, just next to each other.     I snuggle in one, and then somehow in the middle of the night I kick it off with my awesome leg. Then, as if on cue, my body just snuggles into the next one and I wake up under covers. XD|`|livX6UG1aa	The same thing happens to me!     It's because I kick them off in my sleep, so now, before I fall asleep i make sure that they are laid out pefectly (by tucking in the corners and the bottom) and then I put the covers tucked around one of my ears. Somehow, this actually works. I don't know why!     but I just cover my ear with my blanket and I haven't kicked them off in a few months!|`|PFGo7nFXaa	hey yours iis still better than man. my blanket is either on the floor on my side or on the floor in the front im either on top of it and 3 of my pillows are on the floor and last time i fell on the floor and took my whole bed down with me ROFL|`|tveAgF0aaa	well, obviously you roll around ALOT! don't worry, I have the same problem.  Chances are you have a crappy mattress, so you can't get comfortable when you sleep, hence the rolling.  My matress at school is like a rock, so I always wake up weird.  Try getting one of those foam matress covers.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	maybe you're worried about something...    something is going on in your life and your conscience wont let you sleep properly...    stress usually leads to not being able to sleep comfortably at night...    try drinking a glass of water or a nice warm tea before sleeping...    hope it works...good luck =)|`|WlywfjG1aa	I think you roll quite a lot which is the primary reason. But you must understand why you roll so much ? Is it that your sleep is not sound ? You have some digestion problems? You are over anxious ? You need to go into analysis of root cause.

I don't know how I started doing it (it could be that I have a very minor case of OCD), but I always have chapped lips because of it and I never remember to use chapstick. Chapped lips hurt but I don't even think about it when I pick at them...    Also, I crack my knuckles, but that's really common.|`|Ow7I1J1gaa	It's not that unusual i guess but I subconsciously click my finger nails together all the time and it sounds like I'm clicking a pen, it annoys people sometimes.

BycbT5Reaa	No, it will devalue the money. So if you print up a whole bunch of money, sure you have more - but in the scheme of things, your money is worth less, so you're still in debt.    Like if the US printed up a few trillion dollars, they'd have more in circulation, but they would still have a huge debt because one US dollar would be worth so much less. Prices would leap, but not value - because everyone would have a lot more money. If you make five times as much money (because the money is worth less), you can afford to pay five times as much for milk and won't be any richer/poorer than before.
RvmYqQtRaa	I thought about just typing "calm." But in all truth my mind operates like a spiral of thoughts that lead to a conclusion. Calm would be just the average of every single care of my life placed into one word.

Wy47JwOQaa	I take it as a sign that he finds you to be worthwhile and one heck of a catch!  Its a compliment.  Beautiful and Simple.  Don't read too far into it.|`|RAOrCnonaa	He could easily have been joking and you're reading way too much into it. He could mean any number of things. Don't freak out from one comment. Just see how things go.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Did you ask him what he meant?  Honey, he's the person you need to ask.  But the third date is way too soon to decide you are falling in love.  Falling in like, or falling in lust..... sure.  Falling in love, no.|`|ebqQAzk1aa	He's a weirdo.....run|`|Z8qBgv8taa	That is very odd and can be a red flag for abusive behavior. Be careful.|`|DpLAe1Vpaa	Ok, as an aquarius, I can see why he said that. First of all, aquarians are very quick to decide whether we like someone or not. If so, we keep them, if not, we drop them. (but hopefully not too harshly) The tough part is that we tend to be quite clingy. That's pretty much an overall thing with aquarians, but something that isn't as highly common as that it's as easy to fall out of love than it is to fall in love. Personally, I'm not that way, but I would still be careful. But don't think he's weird because he said that on only the third date. I'm sure he's not a stalker, he probably just felt the need to tell you his feelings, which is a good thing! Especially with men! lol.|`|RFJE5TzYaa	He may be in love, he may be in lust and confusing it for love...    There is no way to 'know' unless you ask him, and if you are in a relationship you should feel confident enough to ask him...    "when we went out the other day you said you could not wait for me to fall in love with you...tell me what you meant by that..."    Be open and honest now in the beginning and it opens doors for the future.  Don't start out in mystery!    True love does not chase away  :)    ~A|`|1oDwKgSmaa	I think it is simple... He really likes you and can not wait for you to feel the same about him. I think he has allot of emotions and can not really share with you yet, not until he is shure how you feel about him. He clearly made up his mind about you... and is waiting for your final decision.     have fun! ('',)
DuLhv7Ajaa	Poverty is the fault of the individual. You don't work you don't eat, pretty simple.|`|AA11400829	In that view, you would probably argue that Society holds people down. Such as that the poor have to work bad jobs, bad hours with very little benefits. They can assistance from the government, but the second they start getting themselves out of it, they lose the assistance. I know someone who was getting welfare, and starting working more hours because she wanted to change her life. The second she started making over $1000/month at Wal-Mart, she lost her welfare and then she was working more hours but getting as much money as when she had welfare.    In that way, society holds people down. The poor have a harder time getting into college. They get stuck in dead end jobs.    In that way Society holds them down, and that's what Sociology|`|2KWz3Feuaa	The sociological perspective looks at the structural factors that cause people to be poor.  For example if you grow up in a really poor neighborhood, schools may not be as good, there are fewer resources that help kids further themselves educationally, and teachers may have lower expectations for you.  These are all factors that impede how far you go with your education, and thus how successful you'll be, how much money you'll earn, etc...It's harder to avoid poverty if you've been raised in poverty than if you've had the advantages of being raised with more money and resources.
elgVgRCRaa	Well you're reasons are different than mine but I can relate to this. I too wanted to kill myself and thought of it all the time. I was on Zoloft and Depakote for my bipolar for many years and found it did little to help so I quit.     What helped me was not God or understanding my problems but the world. This might not help you but the way I saw it was one night I laid down and thought to myself what if I died. Really died, not the thought of no more pain and problems. I realized that I would not exist any longer. Whether I would go to heaven or hell or no where is irrelevant. You no longer have the opportunity to feel sad, to feel happy, to see the sun peak through the clouds and the floods sweep away the land. Good and bad all in balance but being alive I realized, while not as glamorous as on TV, is more about living for tomorrow. Focus on appreciating the small time you have because we will all die soon. The choice is yours, all I ask is to think about how great it is to be alive because this is all you have. You can't come back from death.|`|65p86fMtaa	You feel like u can't do anything about your situation, but talk to your mother...i have GAD(General Anxiety Disorder), so basically i get like you everynite, but what helps me is praying to god,read sum of the bible and look at the positive things i have in life, and then listen to my mp3, or i usually txt friends to keep my mind busy..

You have a husband. You're an artist. Oh, my question, right; Who is the real Slim Shady, i mean, who is the real 'drifter' ? Is the profile and the teenager who posted this situation the same person? Cause the profile person could be joking on concerned persons like myself, and I truly would want to give helpful advice to the teenager who posted the question if it were/is really truthful. Now I'm confused. please help me help her/ you. please. email me|`|IMYRhWC3aa	I'm so sorry you feel this way. You mentioned in your description you/your family is low on money. Consider getting a job? Maybe at a fast food restaurant? That may not help much but it will sure benefit you in some ways. I'm a bit confused at when you brought up living with your mother or father. Who do you want to live with? Who are you living with right now? If you don't mind me asking. You mentioned "he did things to me no grown man should EVER do to a teenager" who are you referring to when you say "he?"    A way to cope with this is instead of crying yourself to sleep, take out your iPod/mp3 player right before bed, and play your favourite song, make sure it's not "sad," and hum or mouth along to it quietly. This helps your brain relax and it helps you focus on the song more than your problems. Hope I helped!

GHZnLiYvaa	Well, I think you should believe her and be friends with her. She accepts you as a friend and that's the reason she apologized.

029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	Kate,  I'm sorry for your hurt. It may be helpful to understand that just because your Mom is your mom, she is still a person and people can make mistakes. It sounds like (from the limited info above) that she is not understanding how hurtful and damaging her words are to you.    I was a very inward and insecure child and young woman. What others told me and thought about me affected me deeply. What I have learned over the years is that the only person I need to listen to is myself. The opinion I carry of myself is the only one that matters.     Does that mean that I can be self-serving and self-centered. No. What it does mean is that I have to love and honor myself (in my case, through God) in order for me to be able to reach for my dreams, for me to overcome insecurities and be a productive, loving person...no matter how anyone else treats me or what anyone else thinks of me.     My advice: You could talk to your Mom using effective communication and let her know how you feel using statements such as "I feel rejected when you cut down my dreams" or "I feel hurt and unloved when when we fight". (I've learned that when you use the words "I feel" when communicating that the other person cannot attack you because they cannot tell you how you feel or don't feel)  If talking to her doesn't work, then try sitting down with a counselor that can help you sort out your feelings and then maybe you will be able to confront your mom.    I have a feeling that your Mom loves you...but like I said, even mom's make mistakes. Don't let those mistakes build a wall that will keep your love from each other. God bless!|`|jR0GYS0waa	Don't get upset.Always keep your mind in relaxation.There are different techniques available which helps in reducing stress.Yoga,mediation,Relaxation techniques really  helps in reducing the depression.|`|7uimzAn8aa	It seems to me that you look to your perents for recognition and acceptance, but are not getting it which is why you are feeling down about yourself.    What you should do is aim for a goal that is easier to achieve, something simple, like clearing out your room, or aim to get something simple done in a day. At the end of the day, recap on all the things you got done, and forget about the ones you haven't and save those for tomorrow. Basically, just be determined in what you want to do, and you will find your confidence and faith in yourself will improve dramically.

If you are really that suicidal you should talk to someone. Everyone fights with their parents, it's not a big deal and I'm not sure it's something everyone grows out of. I still fight with my parents, they don't like me being an adult. It's just something you sort of get use to. Good luck with everything.

You are pretty much in a typical teenager/parent relationship. Now the yelling part...maybe not so much. But as for the rest, yeah, this is normal.    Not everything at this point in your life has to be approved by your Mom. Your dreams are your dreams. Those dreams may not be what your Mom thinks you should be or do, and her job is to voice those options. Mom's have ideas for their kids which may not be what their kids ideas are. Normal. Not to worry. This will pass given time and you will become wonderful friends again.    So, if your Mother seems to be undermining your dreams, don't let that stop youl After all, they are YOUR dreams, not hers. So when she pooh pooh's your goals and dreams, smile sweetly, kiss her on the cheek, tell her you love her and that you can only dream like this because of the great upbringing she gave you.    Then go do your thing.|`|RFJE5TzYaa	Greetings,    Your Mom is full of anger and hate and her ego is feeding off of hurting you.  There is an Ego within each of us, not ego as in 'conceited' but more like the little 'devil' that sits on the shoulder.    Please find the book "A New Earth" by Eckhart Tolle and read it, this will let you understand completely why your Mom is doing this.    She is not trying to hurt you, this is how she was taught to be.  Odds are one or both of her parents did this to her so she knows no different.  She never reached her dreams so her ego does not want to allow you to reach yours.  Keeping you 'down' she can do this to you but ONLY if you allow it.    What you need to do is each time she attacks you verbally, don't fight back.  Her ego is feeding off of the confrontation and the fight.  It wants the power struggle, it wants to win.  Simply listen and let her say her part.  Then in your heart send her love.  Do not take anything personal, this is one of the Four Agreements from Toltec wisdom.    Just know it is NOT you okay?  Please read the book...  You'll understand...    Do not hate yourself!  You are coming from a place of light, I can tell by your words and you can make your life a wonderous thing!    ~A|`|55xYyKOEaa	i noe that feeling when you really wanna change but can't..what i do is start telling jokes to mah parents (which usually starts the fights) :D|`|t9grAhudaa	Talk to a school counsellor or a trusted adult/friend. Confront your mom and don't be afraid to show her your feelings.|`|EOrpDYrBaa	Listen one thing i learned through a novel is that suicide is NEVER the answer. A few problems:    1) Failure attempt. May leave your seriously injured, you may lay there paralyzed for a few hours and freeze/suffocate/burn/drown/etc to death.  2) Lifelong problems. Such as paralyzed body or really weak lungs/etc.    Listen its easy to understand that perhaps you and your mom have complications. Know this isn't as uncommon as you may think. Bad family relationships occur in many families. Don't give up and stoop to her level, for example don't attempt to change yourself, and most certainly DO NOT show your true hurt emotions that she causes. This will only have a slight chance to change the whole problem, but most likely cause you two to have further awkwardness and complications. Simply say "so" or "whatever" to all her crap. Also man don't feel bad about arguing, its natural and its kinda training for your future "manhood".|`|wSyJzYv1aa	hi i deffinantley understand its always like my sister and mom are out to get me and when i get into fights with them i always blame myself for thinking of what ill say or do to them they say things to make me mad especially my sister all u need to do to control your temper is hav faith in God and u WILL get through it i will to "with God all things are possible." youll get through it its not your fault God bless u and i hope all goes well with your situation
uBaKOoU6aa	The development of these technics are followed up by a "force" which is advertisement - through which you can manufacture or induce *wants* in people. People who are not rooted in philosophy would easily lose their feet and follow the advertisement's appeal leading to more consumption. However, during times of economic contraction - where the speculative content gets fused away, this doesn't work anymore. So all people who have woven their lives learning and mastering these technics would find themselves at the receiving end in a pretty bad shape.|`|AA10632598	One cannot say. Suppose you have children interested in seeing television or playing video games you need not go to sight seeing places during weekends and that saves lot of petrol or gas or diesel. More over due to advancement in technology the present products are fuel efficient. One may, in years to come evolve techniques to generate power from water or tap solar energy at cheap costs. Any way sun is getting hotter and hotter. We have no shortage of solar energy and if we grow firewoods in wastelands ( a rough estimates put that in India we have 20 million hactares of waste land ) we will have no energy crisis for thousand of years.
vAdtlZDpaa	The people in our dreams represent different facets of our personality.   In the beginning you are being chased, which is a dream symbol for running away from our problems and not facing them. But then your hero takes care of the "problems" for you, and you feel safe. I think that is representative of your more rational, intellectual, assertive (male) side taking charge and deciding not to let your emotions control you. A blonde haired person in your dream is a symbolf for enjoying life.     I think this dream is an effort on the part of your subconscious to process something that happened in your waking life where you were feeling threatened, but were able to step up and overcome your fears. As a result you have a newfound confidence (symbolized by your hero in the dream who is strong and handsome). The part of the dream moving forward into the future and you two having kids is symbolic of how your life can produce fruits (bear children) as a result of you having unified these facets of your personality (the emotional and rational).|`|7uimzAn8aa	To see mountains in your dream, signify many major obstacles and challenges that you have to overcome. If you are on top of the mountain, then it indicates that you have achieved and realized your goals. You have recognized your full potential. Alternatively, mountains denote a higher realm of consciousness, knowledge, and spiritual truth.    To see a man in your dream, denotes the masculine aspect of yourself - the side that is assertive, rational, aggressive, and/or competitive. If the man is known to you, then the dream may reflect you feelings and concerns you have about him. It may also highlight your desires to be in a relationship and your image of the ideal man or feelings to be protected/cared for/looked after.    Hope this helps.|`|9lHduEWUaa	The man you met embodies the qualities that you have to obtain to mature to the next level. All these people that were trying to harm you, which you were running away from, are the obstacles and problems in your life. But rather than running you must confront them and neutralize them, just like the guy did.     Then there's the part about children and this man being dangerous. My guess is you've got issues of trust with men that you'll need to overcome if you want to truly love a guy and have a happy family.|`|9Y9BBB99aa	im a dream interpreter and you simply need to get laid|`|6rrVUYslaa	may be u need a guy in your life...since u don't have him in your life for real, you tend to dream about him..if this kind of dream repeats and you see him time and again, may be its a little more than just a dream.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	your dream reminds me of a fairytale.  A women runs away from her hurtful youth and falls into a capable and handsome man arms. He takes the lead by nulling all of her past and bringing her into his sturdy world. From there they live and prosper and live happily ever after.  Keep dreaming that one dear, its a good one :)|`|AFAegaNGaa	The guy in the dream is you, hence the same age, and the ones chasing you are certain actions, behaviors, ideals, beliefs, etc of yourself that you have either let go of, are letting go of, or soon will.   Your higher brain functions are processing this information and you're seeing the residual chemical effects of this informational processing and coding.   You feel connected and close baecause that man is really you and YOU have the ability inside to find comfort, help, smiles, and the like and all you have to do is accept it from yourself and it shall be.
7uimzAn8aa	To see a shooting in your dream, indicates that you have a set goal and know what you are aiming for in life. Your plans are right on target!    To dream that you shoot a person with a gun, denotes your aggressive feelings and hidden anger toward that particular person.  To dream that someone is shooting you with a gun, suggests that you are experiencing some confrontation in your waking life. You may feel victimized in some situation.    To dream that you are on a battlefield, represents some major conflict occurring in your waking life. It may indicate a new situation, new problem or new relationship which you need to solve and conquer.    It's a pretty common dream, it means you are a resolved person, who has goals and aims to achieve them!|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Dreams that recur (or repeat themselves) is a clear indication that some issue is not being confronted or that it has not yet been resolved.  Your anxieties about a certain situation that you are struggling with may also cause you to have recurring dreams.     To dream of shooting someone indicates anger or rage that you are repressing or not acknowledging in your waking life. To dream of someone's death indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	Re occurring dreams suck, so annoying, you wake up knowing that you've dreamt it before and you think "what is it trying to tell me?"

WKyPDbglaa	It just shows the historical switch in the word and the fact that feminism has devolved into a supremacy movement.           What some feminist's don't understand or do understand but revel in it is the fact that feminism doesn't just represent women's interests but actively sabotages men's rights.          When you have the NOW demanding more money and more programs(even though there are already hundreds) that benefit women only and yet when congress creates 1 program designed to help fathers(but mothers may also use it) they threaten with lawsuits and everything else till it is shut down.            I know most feminist's are ignorant and self centered so I will try to explain to them the problem males face.          In the 21st century we have no representation in government or in society at all. Medical programs aimed towards our gender specific problems(we are even discriminated against for supposedly "non gender related health research and programs") are grossly underfunded. We are discriminated against in the educational system and in the work force with a gender gap of 1.25$ that women in metropolitan areas make for same hours same job.           We have no real property rights, hell we don't even have basic fundamental reproductive rights.     And every time we try to have conventions or committees to address these problems feminists use protests, death threats and political pressure to either shut it down or silence it.           When ever we speak openly in public we are told to "be men" as a method to shut us up.         I am sorry but I won't bow before feminist tyranny and bigotries.            We will no longer be the silent oppressed class anymore.|`|8miMWB64aa	The KKK used to be a fraternity, without racism.  Wearing the white hood wasn't a bad thing, but it meant that they were a community leader.  Racism later picked up in their organization, and the white hood is now a symbol.    I think that feminism is similar.  It used to be something that had some meaning to it, but it's since been hijacked by sexists who found an ultimate flag to fly under.  Some people still don't get this.  I don't know why.    I do think that anyone who calls themself a "feminist" is at fault when they only criticize the sexism from men.  It's this active pursuit against that sort of sexism, and not that perpetrated by females, that has led to the blanket distaste for feminists as a whole.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	It shows the lies and hypocrisy of feminism.  How feminists claim to be one thing (for equality) but their actions show the complete opposite (only focus on the interests of women).|`|TCB2C8NPaa	A definition from 1895 does not necessarily have to be out of date, but might be.  I imagine when it concerns a movement that is well over a hundred years old, a revision may be necessary.  Likely a few qualifiers are needed, but it's just a dictionary definition, not encyclopaedia.  I imagine most people don't want to read a page.  My dictionary calls feminism "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men" which encompasses both 1 and 2.    In 1895, point two would not have contradicted point one as achieving political, economic, and social equality of the sexes required a lot of organized activity on the behalf of women's rights and interests.  This is still the case in many areas of the world.  In some industrialized places, it is something of a contradiction as it means that women's rights and interests take the front-seat which may result in inequality between the sexes.  It's really only a contradiction in places where full equality has been achieved.  In all probability, organized activity needs to take place for both men and women.  There are still inequalities for women, but there are also inequalities for men that have been created and these need to be addressed.    Some so-called feminists do not truly want equality, but others of us do.  If you don't want people to overgeneralize, thus posting blatant lies about you, please return the favour in kind.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I doubt it, if it were deemed unfit, it would've been removed or updated like they do with any other word, right?    Do a definition on Urban Dictionary or something haha    Also, no, I don't think it's contradictory considering women's rights just meant gaining the rights men had. So to *get* up to equal, women's rights needed the focus.     'Human rights' are for both, when men were the only humans that had rights, women's rights were the ones involved.    We've been down this road before, yes I agree that in the Western world women have them, there's still too many out there who don't. And yes, men as well.     Human rights are a huge issue as well as specifically women's rights in many countries of the world, in many places both are suffering, but the women are suffering that much more.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Feminism has always been about contradictions and hypocrisy. It's accurate for the dictionary to show this point.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Then take it up with the editors of Merriam-Webster.    And let us know how that goes!|`|LRY2Ho5Zaa	True feminism asks for equality between the sexes, which i agree with. But many many "feminists" want to make it so that women will gain more rights then men which is not what the original feminists set out to do IE Susan B, Anthony. I think its a shame that women that claim to be feminists these days are so hypocritical because they blame men for everything (especially sex drive which men obviously have more of  then women which is a genetic trait by humans to even out population, not too much on both sexes and not too little) that they forget that women are also at just as much fault as men are and should take responsibilities for their actions instead of passing the blame.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	The biggest hypocrites on here are anti feminist men who claim to be all for equality, but really aren't. You want to go back to the way things were in 1860, but don't have the guts to admit it.

I would feel the same anxiety if it were John McCain, George W. Bush or the Lucky Charms leprechaun in charge.

People running the big corporations and what not can be corrupt.|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	To some extent yes, but at least the government isn't oppressing our people as the communist governments did the opposite (oppress their people).|`|z93tSvKxaa	Capitalism is not the problem and socialism and communism is definitely NOT THE answer.  It is corruption and people which create the problem.  There really is no such thing as a FAIR MARKET.  In order for a nation to survive it must look out for the well being of it's inhabitants FIRST. The United States unfortunately for the last 40 years has not looked out for itself first.  Corruption is ripe in Washington and has been for years.  However the last 8 years of the Bush administration has really shown most Americans how deep corruption is in Washington.  There are so many topics I could talk on but let's begin first with trade.    The U.S. signed a fair trade deal with China.  However how can the deal be of FAIR TRADE when China has a work force willing to work for lower wages and raises expensive tariffs in order to prevent the import of U.S. goods?  Not only is there a serious trade deficit with China but also with Japan, Canada, and Mexico. If the U.S. fails to produce it's own consumer goods then how can it survive as a nation?  True Americans like cheaper goods but at what expense?    Despite Japan's inflation, they still put their industries and their people FIRST.  True it is expensive to live in Japan, and their aging population is getting larger.  However, the Japanese economy remains strong and their people remain dedicated to their culture.  Unlike here in America where the govt. has allowed millions of legal and illegal immigrants into the country.  The problem is this is great during times of prosperity but in times such as these, what about the American citizens?  This creates a problem.    The second aspect is education.  The U.S. allows millions of foreign exchange students into this country. However, if a foreign exchange student takes the seat of a qualified American student how fair is that?    The third aspect is healthcare.  The U.S. imports millions of nurses from the Phillippines.  Yet, we have a back log of nursing students in American schools.  Colleges are not enlarging nursing classrooms or hiring more nursing educators.  Yet the govt. continues to give green cards to Filipino nurses who are often unqualified.  They often make erroneous errors in healthcare and many lack proper bedside manners and training.  Yet, if a foreign physician wants to practice here in America he has to undergo American medical school training.  Should we not hold the same standards for ALL of our healthcare workers?    Finally on Obama:  I think Obama has good intentions but he is going about his spending the wrong way. The bill he proposed IS NOT A STIMULUS IT IS A SPENDING BILL.  Let's think rationally for a moment.  Since the govt. is in severe debt where is the money coming from?  This means that we have to borrow more money from foreign govts.  Obama is WRONG in not offering more TAX CUTS TO AMERICANS WHO PAY TAXES.   Giving more money for child credits and daycare is NOT GOING TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY.  Once again his talk on responsibility was a waste of time.  If people want children then they should be fiscally responsible to pay for them.    Second small business owners and taxpayers need a tax break. WE ARE THE ONLY ONES HOLDING UP THE ECONOMY.  People on welfare and receiving medicaid and foodstamps are NOT HOLDING UP THE ECONOMY.  For starters Obama needs to have even more welfare reform. There are many people receiving medicaid and food stamps who should not receive them.  Earned child credit should only be FOR ONE CHILD.  Why does the govt. keep giving money to people who are irresponsible???      **Obama once again is dropping the ball.  Working American people are tired of living in a welfare state.  We want responsibility not only from the govt.  but also from fellow Americans.|`|LiRcparVaa	well to begin stalin took control of russia by revolt and then killed off the families of his enemies most all of them russians if you can equate that to george bush you  must be smoking some goo d stuff, capitalism isn't the fault sister liberalism is, look for an attack from the muslim radicals soon, your messiah just surrendered the country to them monday Iran's answer just came this morning if you live in a densely populated area best be moving|`|JgFkmif9aa	Your assessment of Capitalism seems to be based on stereotypes and caricatures of the world ("the evil CEO", "the heartless corporation", "the struggling little guy") rather than actual economic theory.

7J6m0L3Haa	Poverty, sexism, and racism are systems of suppression and exploitive hierarchy in which the most grievous inequalities and injustices are perpetuated across geographic areas and generations. They frequently intersect to worsen each other. For example, poor black single mothers were the villains of the welfare system for a long time. Because of the classist, racist, and sexist construction of their situations, many many African American women were serialized against their will or told that they could not receive assistance until they agreed for the government to serialize them. This disgusting system of eugenics was popular through the 60s and 70s while the federal government handed out low-interest loans to white families who could not afford them otherwise. While white families got assistance, black women were sterilized. This is discussed in further detail in Robert's "Killing the Black Body".    Because of past inequalities, present disadvantages are handed down through the generations. Which is further exacerbated if one is the member of many unesteemed classes--such as a poor black woman. For instance, the civil rights leadership, for a very long time, was solely held by black men. Likewise, feminist leadership was kept by white women. Thus, the black woman suffered from racism in women's rights movements, and sexism in the civil rights movements.    The intersections of oppression are actually a huge topic in third wave feminism.

Feminist's have historically been responsible for those things at one time or another.     racism: The precursor to the NOW (the WKKK) was both a racial supremacy group and a female supremacy group.    Poverty: By altering the law's to unfairly benefit mothers, fathers have been thrown out of the lives of there children causing the children to be more likely to be in poverty most of there lives.    Sexism: Look at the present educational system. Look at our colleges and campus's, if you see nothing wrong it is because your probably a female supremacist.
5vcd7GHNaa	Well, I was always left out when I was younger cause my mom needed to pay attention to my "beloved sister".     Everytime, I would just "blow up" and hide in the closet, sleeping in there for hours at a time until my mom would finally come and say, "What the hell? You have homework to do!"    :[ Then my sister left for Toronto Law School, and now my mom pays me a little more attention.    But honestly, I made a mistake. I should've told my mom my feelings. She never knew, she thought I was just selfish and going through "normal teen mood swings."    EDIT:    I have to admit, though... my family doesn't act like a family. My dad's life is all about work, I hardly talk to him (approx 50 sentences a year including Hi.). He works all day and the only thing he says to me is: "Work hard!"    My mom has never been hugged or loved by her mother in her life. :] My sister was brought up the same way. But for me, I wanted to be cared, and I wanted to show my mother this wasn't all there was to life.     When I feel left out, I imagine my parents as little kids, unsafe, and insecure. :] That's why 've survived this long.

Your son may be questioned about this older boy and what was done, but you must also be there to 'defend' him.  I trust that you are no longer in contact with the older boy, and if you are, then I suggest that you go to any 'women's shelter' that can house both you and your son and stay there until this boy can be investigated and dealt with by the authorities.  You did right, but the way will be rougher for you for a while because of it ...

Do not be overly concerned though, most children his age are curious about sexuality and do not understand that younger children are not appropriate for exploring. It should not seriously affect your son, especially at his young age, but it would be a good idea to plan for child-to-parent counseling in the future to make sure he is still alright.    [Edit] I just reread the first line of my second paragraph and it does not have the connotation I meant for it to have. I did not mean it was alright for him to touch your son, but rather that it might have been innocent in nature. I know that at that age it is very confusing as to what is alright and not alright to explore, the other boy definitely needs to be given a talk on that subject.

ngxw9waWaa	I have learnt from experience and empirical evidence the mind works to clear the subconscious of negative natter causing ill reactions and behavioural patterns. Until these negative issues created by life trials and trauma are expressed, spoken and cleared them in is engaged in a necessity of rambling, talking and muttering, whirring as many cogs of a machine consuming essential energy from the brain force.    Until these problems are addressed understood and exorcised the mind labours and toils to expel them from the psyche. As an infected hard drive on a computer slows performance and exposes to viruses using up the computers resources thus the brain is similar in its mechanisms.    Stilling the mind requires dispelling of the ingrained hard wired thoughts. Therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation or self prognosis and a concerted effort to avert the addictive need to write lengthy discourses, speak voluminously or think incessantly about incoherent thought processes without sequence s or objective, or given purpose. The inhibiting obstacles are your fears, some conscious some unconscious, hates generated by adverse experience, or habitual addictions caused by an addictive need easily remedied upon recognition of such affliction.    Excessive brain activity can be likened to a fever caused by bacteria in the body causing inflammation and sapping energy resources resulting in   a weakened immunity. When the bacteria are flushed out, the negativity fears and stress is found and eliminated the bodys natural biological equilibrium is restored.     The object is to clear all channels of the mind and body and create harmonious equipoise. It is when the blessed few accomplish this state of nirvana the mind is released into the higher dimension of universal consciousness.|`|p0a1dB28aa	Drink Odwallo juice for focus, it's $4.00 bucks, but helps me focus in class.

Well let's see, a woman can call the police on her husband after hitting him with a frying pan. The man may not even fight back, or strike her in any way, and the police will arrest the husband as they were taught to by the billions wasted to promote radical feminist ideology from the women-only available VAWA funds. The man, doesn't even have to be in a marriage, can get served a warrantless temporary restraining order against him with absolutely no proof or physical evidence solely on the word of a woman. The temp. order then is rubberstamped by our wonderful, Soviet-style "family court" system. This is after the poor guy has been sitting in jail for a week or more. So much for due process. Then he is ordered to not return to HIS home, while the golddigger is living it up in the home he is paying rent or mortgage payments on. He is not allowed to see his children, all on the word of a woman who claims he is abusive to them. There doesn't even have to be any violence involved. All the woman has to do is call the police and claim that she "feels threatened." What the hell does that mean? Then the poor guy is assumed to be guilty and hauled off to jail. I want my 14th amendment rights back. In effect women are given the power to incarcerate men on a whim and ruin their lives, and are automatically believed by the courts. Uh huh, that sure is "equality." <br>  What about divorce? The women are almost automatically given the children if they say, without any corroborating evidence whatsoever, he was abusive. They are given the house if there are children. [The women are told by lawyers to claim abuse, so they get the children and the man's house.]  Then the poor guy is forced to pay inflexible, unrealistic, exorbitant child support payments, and alimony to support the woman's "accustomed livestyle," her new boyfriend, and maybe his kids with whatever she doesn't spend on new shoes.<br>  Women get to murder their husbands in cold blood while they are asleep, then claim she was abused in court, and get 6 months for 1st degree murder.They always get lighter jail sentences if any jail time. I know a girl who stabbed a guy because she pissed him off. The guy lost 10 inches of intestine and the girl got 5 years probation. If I stab some one in the guy, I'd be locked up for 10 years or longer.<br>  People said that women don't have to register for the draft. Not only that but they have much lower physical standards for women in the military, and women are not allowed in front line combat. I don't want women in trench warfare or anything like that, but it is a privilege that they do have. If a woman wants to be a firefighter or a cop, they also have lessened physical requirements. Do fires and criminals say, "Oh it's a woman, I'd better be less 'dangerous' for them?"

It follows classic Hubert theory, otherwise known as peak oil.  If you have netflix there is an excellent documentary on the subject call "A Crude Awakening."      I think....      High gas prices= A little less money to spend.  add that to to the marginally calculated sub prime mortgages and THAT's why we got all the forclosures.  Do you really think that the banks "just miscalculated"?  Cmon.  They forgot to account for peak oil in their equation cause now one believed all those "stupid science nerds".  Add then that the resulting drop in real estate values hit a lot of investors HARD, and in turn lenders for a second time, then approval rules tightened excessively lowering operating capital for all business, then layoffs began, then more people couldn't spend money, so the economy got worse, so more layoffs, so the economy got even worse, and so on, and so on, and so on. Of course this happened everywhere, excluding the subprime problem which is a U.S. thang, but it certainly didn't help the global economy.  Don't worry.  Its easy to fix if we get some non idiots into office which I hope we just did.  Do something patriotic and buy some stock.  BET ON AMERICA!

Its politics, economics, and a mess. I will try to give you a brief overview but if you need more information or help with any part let me know. Also I am not presenting a partisan opinion here, only facts.    Lets start at how we got to the current depression. I would argue that it started many years ago with Alan Greenspan, appointed to the US Treasury in 1987 by Reagan. He came in with an idea; laissez faire capitalism. He wanted to deregulate business and banking. He felt competition would correct itself and allow for more profitability. The banks began issuing sub-prime loans because if they want more money then you need more consumers. That bottom had to fall out at some point and it did. People who had financed in these loans could not pay their loan back and the banks then were failing to make income. As the housing and sub-prime markets crashed so did the banks. This has much to do with interbank lending. As banks shift money through the system they borrow from other banks to cover themselves for a short time at a reduced rate. Well as banks were losing money that lending dried up and banks that were in good shape no longer felt safe lending to banks that were barely keeping out of bankruptcy. This leads to the commercial paper market drying up as well. Commercial paper is what a company like Staples for instance would use to pay their employees. As the company makes money it takes time to get into the banks and then distribute to the employees so most corporations borrow money on a short term to pay payroll. As that dried up you saw jobs lost and as jobs are lost  there are less people able to buy goods and more jobs are lost. Basically the bubble burst and now people are having trouble making ends meet and as people put less money into the market, the market fails more (hence stimulus plan). Greed is the main reason for this mess. Banks were greedy for sub-prime lenders.     As for global control of prices that is somewhat how it works now, but not by government. That is Socialist and if there is one thing Americans hate more than *fill in the blank* its Socialists (stupidity really). Anyways so prices are set by supply and demand in a world of global economy. Free trade reduces costs to a great deal. A country can dump its subsidized goods onto the market and make it impossible to compete (American agriculture, Chinese everything else). The problem you are facing with consumers suffering from high costs is due to inflation and a recession. As the market falls deeper, a person makes less money when compared to the rising prices from inflation. Really goods at least in America and most developed nations are quite cheap so that is not an issue but the deepening recession is.     Oil is the most difficult to explain. There are many factors that determine the price of oil. Supply and demand are a great deal of determination but equally important is the oil speculation on the market. OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) controls most oil that is supplied to the world. In determining the price of oil OPEC will speed up production to lower prices and slow it down to raise prices. It is all about maximizing their profitability. They will sell oil for as much as the market will allow. External factors like hurricanes destroying refineries also play a role because it lessens the supply as well. Scarcity makes oil valuable. It is expensive to find and extract. It must be refined in order to use. The reason gas prices are low now hinges on many things. First the global economy is in a recession, because most major markets are intertwined a failure in one country ripples. This recession means that countries will not pay as much per gallon. Oil speculation is another reason. People would speculate on the cost of oil in the future and buy/sell commodities on the international oil exchange. As they speculate a rise in prices, the price of oil rises. The whole oil speculation scheme is so complex I cannot post it all here due to the size of this post already. Google or Yahoo Search "oil speculation". Here is a link as well http://money.howstuffworks.com/oil-specu...    Hopefully this helps and will give you an idea of how to learn more yourself. It is an interesting mess that we are in.|`|EyZEA6J0aa	mm|`|lJPFlcOTaa	because people are lazy and use up all the resources so they end up causing harm to all those around them..basically people are wasteful and eventually it will effect a largeer amount as well|`|CwaxhSvraa	Banks started giving loans to people who couldn't pay the money back. Especially in mortgages. Then the banks took peoples houses to settle the debt. With so many houses and people with not enough money the house market collapsed. So now the banks own houses that nobody wants and they don't have the money that they gave the people to buy the houses. Then the bank situation lead to banks failing, people pulling money out of stock because they are afraid of businesses (like banks) failing, which lead to the stock market crash. Since companies lost money in stocks they laid off workers which made the unemployment rate go up and now people are cutting back on spending so much its causing businesses to lose more money. And this is where we are now. Companies cant lower prices because then they would lose money and make the economy worse.|`|WFxVuM1Laa	I'll tell you why! Its the damn illegal immigrants coming into this country in droves. I live in Texas and there are now more mexicans here than white people. Im not racist but they come here illegally and go to the hospitals for free treatment and they know they cant be turned away. and who pays for it you and me! They come here to work then take the money back to mexico instead of spending it here. America land of the free.... yes but how free can it get?
4Vchxp32aa	because it's better.  Keynesian deals with expanding aggregate demand during economic downturns.  Though aggregate supply cannot be controlled completely, aggregate demand basically can.  We can, for instance, give everyone 10,000 dollars and this will expand demand for all normal good.  Overall, the increase in aggregate demand with a inelastic aggregate supply curve means higher output and higher prices.  Hence, the short-run trade off between employment and inflation.  People who questions the trade-off need to explain why they do not agree with the short-run upward slopping aggregate supply curve.  If the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward slopping, it has to result in the short-run trade-off.|`|73W7ReR9aa	It's basic. You need to learn it before you can play with the others.
kX4JPvwwaa	Mental disorders come in all types.  There's no way to prevent them all, but there are ways to prevent some.<br>  <br>  A big one is trauma, which can cause various anxiety disorders, notably Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.  Prevent traumatic or overly-stressful life events, prevent the disorders that can often follow.<br>  <br>  Another is sleep and diet.  Insomnia is a feature of both depression as well as bipolar disorder.  Both bipolar and depression also tend to go hand-in-hand with poor nutrition (over- or under-eating).
vAdtlZDpaa	Snakes are a very common dream symbol and represent repressed or unacknowledged fears. To dream of being chased means that your sister is running away from her fears instead of facing them head-on.  Calling you for help in her dream and being told that you couldn't get there right away means that your sister thinks that if she were to try and reach out to another to help her to deal with her fear, that she would not get the kind of immediate support that she would like. A wall in a dream is a symbol of an obstacle in one's life or a barrier to achieving one's goals. In her dream, your sister climbed up a wall and the snakes were at the bottom. This means that she feels she has reached a point in dealing with her fear where she is stuck, and doesn't know how to conquer it.|`|Skh7cmOKaa	This question deserves another question. What color were the snakes? If they were black this could mean death in the family. Not one of you all but someone else close to you or her. But if the snakes were any other color this means that your sister is being betrayed by either you or someone else close to her. Have you done something under-handed and sneaky to your sis? Shame on you if it's true! LOL!|`|JiUKeyhGaa	as u should no snakes represent sin and fear this dream can be good or bad she is running from her sins and left them behind or she is reunning from her fears|`|8KbcQGL0aa	She cares very much for you and your safety. You should talk to her and explain all the safety measures that you use in your line of work. The dream was not her in danger it was you. Dreams have a way of putting you in the position of people that you care about or being almost opposite to the actual situation.|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Maybe...she's going to meet obstacles in her life..that's what my grandma used to say...but don't be too superstitious ..as it's just a dream..and life is short..so why do u want to burden your mind with a dream...?Just hope that whatever happens is all for your good...and pray to GOD...|`|mDU9EwxZaa	That is obviously a sex dream.  The snakes represent the penises that they so much resemble.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Her dream is about you & she fears for your safety with your job  maybe she can't understand how you can do this dangerous work just have a talk with her & ease her mind & maybe explain exactly how & what you do so she'll be less fearful
UinOWcMUaa	Well, many answers to your question. 1st get regular sleep, 2nd a better diet, 3rd study 35-40 minutes than take a 15 minute break.. for 5 of those minutes simply meditate on what u have just studied. Try flash cards and or just try memorizing differently. Less distractions, music, girls, movies etc.. the better !!|`|p0a1dB28aa	I think that you should learn your study habits. Maybe you study sunday night so that you could keep it in your mind. Everybody learns in different ways and I don't think you are a bad student I think you just have to figure it out by yourself. You can do it!|`|Yj33dIoJaa	Read your textbook every night. Like read different chapters every night. Don't read only the same chapter. Another thing, you could read it like you are reading a storybook. Don't force yourself to remember.     If you are thinking of course you have to remember, its studying, of course you have to remember. But you can always read and re-read it. And try to remember the facts only before the test.    If you don't like that, I suggest you keep notes. Write down only the more important parts of the textbook and study those. You will have less to read.|`|AA10988215	Psychology can be a tough one simply because there are so many names and dates and it's difficult to remember who did what and when!      If you know the format the exam will take in advance this can effect your revision.  For example, say you had studied 9 topics during your course and you know the exam has 6 topic based essay questions out of which you have to answer 3. You would not need to revise all 9 topics even if you did not know which 6 topics would be included.  If you revised only 6 of these topics you are guaranteed that at least 3 of the topics you have studied will be in the exam.    If you don't know the exam structure, or it is not possible to leave topics out of your revision the best thing to do is revise the fundamental aspects of a theory and the key studies associated with it rather than trying to remember everyone and everything.  An understanding of the theory should make remembering the studies that supported the theory easier and if you can remember a few of the most important studies they should be enough to write an essay on, meaning you have less names to remember for who conducted the study.    When I first started studying psychology I used to cram as much as I could into essays to the point that I'd refer to about 10 different studies.  However, I was soon getting better marks for including maybe 5 studies which were more important to the theory and I could develop better arguments because I could look at a study or theory in more detail than when I was hopping from one to another.    Less can be more in psychology and if you try to revise everything it just becomes a memory game and developing your understanding goes out the window.    Good luck and I hope this helps a bit! :)|`|3f472ffb578b5c756958c260f98d3282aa	Oh i just had a Psychology exam last week and i don't think i done very well in it. Last year i took my AS exams and i got B's. But this year i am worried i will slip down a grade or two.     Any way i find the best way to revise for psychology is to give your self plenty of time to revise. It's A lot of stuff to remember after all. Just keep going over it and over it. Like after a lesson don't just put your book away and forget about it until it comes to revising. Keep getting your book out going back over it. (Multi store model - the more you repeat the easier the Information will be to Access).     Also do something with the infomation you have like make revision cards, read diffrent text books any thing to deeply process it (levels of processing modle - sematically process the infomatiuon).     BUt really i know what it's like to go into an exam and just get the absoultly worng questions. But just learn from this and be more prepared next time. And it's not the end of the world you could always resit.     Good Luck!!!|`|uIXpjxTpaa	I actaully have a friend who feels exactly the same as you, he gets so angry at me, my recommendation to you what did with him.    First we went away and made notes like a brainstorm on each study using lots of colours (this is because your brain responses well to colours and tends to remember more.)  In the brainstorms include the main points, things which will trigger the rest of the study because you dont tend to need very specific details.  E.x. Write the sample like the number of participants, bullet point the procedure like into 4/5 sentences in your own words (simplify it.)  Do this for each study you have to learn.    Then for each study consider the issues such as 'ecological validity' or 'reliablity' try and find a problem or positive thing from the study for each of the following sections;  1. Method ie, EV or data  2. Theory ie, determinism or reductionism  3. Sample ie, country they come from or gynocentric (use of only women)  4. Ethics ie, consent or psychological harm.  You can do this with a friend or on your own im a brainstorm for each study.    Then get together with a friend and go through the studies together with notes first then without, see what you remember and what you dont.  or if you really want a challenge give your brainstorms or your class notes to someone who does not do psychology and try and explain the studies to them see how much you got right.    Sorry its so long  Hope this helps :)
5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Some Americans don't leave the area they grow up in, so they don't know a lot about other parts of their own country, let alone the world. So they can be ethnocentric.    -On the other hand, basing your views of what women look like in another country on a television show is pretty nutty-it's not even real life, the women are actresses!   -You've traveled all over Europe, but have you traveled all over the US? I've traveled all over the US, but that doesn't make me an expert on European men or women's looks...   -You're basing what American women think on what anonymous ppl say on an internet web site? Should I base what all European men think based on what you say?|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I'm not. And neither was my answer to that question..|`|eBMKmgCjaa	They have been told for 40 years that men are the oppressor, are inferior to women etc  so its only natural that many women today look down on men.    For example:    "Men are the enemies of women"  Professor Ann Oakley (1984) in 'Taking It Like a Woman'.    "I believe that women are the more spiritually advanced sex" Erica Jong, Washington Post, December 6, 1992    Naturally if people hear this kind of propaganda enough, they start to believe it.|`|m25lpepOaa	I think one of the major problems of this world is that we classify people too much.

It's rather bigoted to generalize over 150 million people, don't you think? The US population is 300 million, more than half is female. Sort out your own issues before thinking something is wrong with 150 million people instead of yourself. Why would someone be sexy to me or not sexy because they are American or European? You for example are not sexy to me because you have a nasty attitude, but I could find another European or Scottish man to be sexy. Just not you.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	"Sexy" is in the eye of the beholder. You may prefer European woman, but not every man does. Some think that Asian women are the sexiest. Besides, there are sexy and fugly women all over the world.

Are you sexier than all American men?|`|BYu1X7ljaa	You cant judge all American woman like that until you meet every single one that just makes you as bad as the statement "all European woman are hairy".     Anyway look at the media in America is constantly pushed make-up, surgery, products at both genders. It is getting just as bad in Australia.    Anyway where abouts are you from...????    EDIT    You sound as if i was being rude, i am sorry if my answer came across that way. I was actually curious as to where you where from seeing as i have always wanted to travel. I am from Australia and i have always wanted to live in France.     Sex and the city is a very very terrible show, i cant stress that enough. It is true some woman are like that but please know not all of us are ha ha. That show is a perfect example of what the media portrays woman as. It sickens me and it sickens me what they do to men in those shows aswell.     American culture is very strange, there is a show called extreme makeovers in which people undergo plastic surgery and people think it is ok and normal. Australia is headed the same way though.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	"Fancy the pants"?  Lol...I love that phrase.     Anyway, you have to understand that, to many, a question like that is easily taken as an attack and insult...if YOU read a question that said "Why are Scots men so undesirable, they are the bottom of the list, no?" you might have been a bit defensive, too, right?    Obviously, French and Italian women are no more superior, for whatever reason, than they are inferior. Nor are American women. Some were just trying to defend themselves....maybe not in the most PC way.     Let me ask you this...Why did you overlook the OBVIOUS bigotry of the question itself, and only focus on the answers? Was there a reason for that?    EDIT-Please don't act daft for the purpose of throwing up a strawman, I was in no way suggesting that Scotsmen are not attractive....I was, in fact, obviously stating that such generalizations are dumb and pointless....if you had thoroughly read what I wrote.     And maybe we are talking about different questions here, but the one I'm referring to was posted by "Vadlimir Putin" and stated that "American women are the least desirable of all nationalities." This was obviously intended as nothing more than an insult, and in no way "referred" to another post. Perhaps we are talking about different questions, then? For future reference, this sort of confusion can generally be avoided if you provide a link to the question you are referring to. How are we supposed to know who said what, or whether or not you simply misconstrued things, if you don't at least do that?|`|FbaI5OMoaa	For some reason, when I read this question, the first thing that came to mind was:  What do French women smell of?  LOL.    In answer to your question though, I don't think that all American women are the way you describe.  I certainly am not.  Also, it's very difficult to compare American women to women of most other countries because American women vary greatly in appearance even from each other.  We all have different skin colors, body sizes, etc.  So, in my opinion, most generalizations like that would be inaccurate.    Also, the old saying is true. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."  Not every man (or person) sees beauty the same way.|`|nU0pbEhGaa	American women can be very angular looking. Italian and Swedish women come tops! But nothing beats American or Brazilian men! Phew!

vAdtlZDpaa	Beautiful image. I don't know what it means to see an image from your dream in real life, except that perhaps you are really tuned in to cosmic energies.    To dream of an eclipse of the sun  indicates self-doubt and fears of not achieving your goals. You feel you are being overshadowed and are underestimating your abilities. Your level of confidence is fading or lost. You may be undergoing some difficult times and unable to remain optimistic.

57b47866a23aafae5935da2e945386b2aa	I agree with you. Why does the media portray feminism as an equivalent to man-hater? Why is the tem, "men are pigs/dogs" so popular?  It does nothing to help women by demeaning men. "Girl power" should not be taught as a reactionary defense against the "evil man" but as positive support. Its nonsensical, the way tv twists things.

Also had boys in my life constantly and knew they weren't bad, could be really good friends, and generally had no issues with girls vs. boys ever in life.    People will take from life what they want to. As children if they have no guidance then maybe this is bad, but if we let tv raise children...there's more problems than just how they'll feel about gender issues =o/    As adults, the world's opened up to us all, at that point we make our own choices about how we feel and what we believe =o)|`|zWqKuIQuaa	It is just an extension of the "dumb dad" advertising style.

ZOXoPgJbaa	OF course it would. It has nothing to do with globalization. We produce 25% of the world's income. We also consume most of the worlds goods. If our demand for goods decreases, other economies would feel it as well because we do a lot of importing. They would have surpluses in goods, so prices would have to drop,  and there would be layoffs because companies dont need as many workers to produce as much.|`|6Fp1KVIKaa	The world may be more complicated but in the end economics is economics.  I will use the example of a small town.  Lets say all the businesses in the town are doing great until one day the largest business in town starts to go under.  Well, at first the other businesses may be fine but eventually with the town bringing in less revenue the other businesses are going to start to get hurt as less people in said town will be able to patronize their establishments.      That is how the US affects the world economy.  The US has the worlds largest economy and we are a net importer of goods.  Thusly when our economy shrinks the rest of the world feels the pain because they have lost their biggest customer or maybe their biggest customer may have lost their biggest customer.  In the end though we all feel the pain because trade is whats important.  Trade creates wealth and wealth creates trade.  When either are seriously disrupted by the internal goings on of one of the trading partners things start to go downhill and in this case again the US is the worlds biggest trading partner.

Also assaultive women did not believe that their male victims would be seriously injured or would retaliate. "Deeper reasons endorsed for initiating aggressive behaviour" included "I believe if women truly are equal to men then women should be able to physically express anger at men" and "I feel personally empowered when I behave aggressively against my partner"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/91293...|`|BkleL3F4aa	feminists groups were showing Bobbitt and Yates as victims. Bobbitt cut off and threw away her husbands penis and Yates drowned all 5 of her children one after the other. feminist groups have been protecting and hiding female abusers for four decades now.    "Finally, there is an alarmingly high rate of sexual abuse by females in the backgrounds of rapists, sex offenders and sexually aggressive men - 59% (Petrovich and Templer, 1984), 66% (Groth, 1979) and 80% (Briere and Smiljanich, 1993). A strong case for the need to identify female perpetrators can be found in Table 4, which presents the findings from a study of adolescent sex offenders by O'Brien (1989). Male adolescent sex offenders abused by "females only" chose female victims almost exclusively."    http://www.canadiancrc.com/female_sexual...      Childrens rights groups echo mens right groups and so called "antifeminists" on many points.

JgFkmif9aa	It depends on how far you want to go in the field of Economics.  If you plan to do any graduate study, than you will need a firm grasp of mathematics.  For an undergraduate's degree, in my experience and that of many other students of economics, mathematics is not incredibly important.  In fact at my college, there was a joke that economics was "the study of not doing the math".
5pohRQ2Zaa	I'm really good @ interpretting dreams. What I think is it means you're going to witness someone go through something that should be very painful but instead it's almost like they like it. & you probably won't know that person very well.    It sounds like you're going to witness or find out a crime. Maybe even be the only one who does witness or figure it out.
TpG33NoWaa	When I was still almost a baby, my mother died.   From what I am told, this really upset me, and I locked myself away from everyone.  My mother was a professional pianist, and I 'played' the piano for literally hours each day (perhaps trying to bring her back?   to remember her?   to replace her?)    When I went to school, I was, for some reason, awfully ashamed that I had no mother, and when anyone befriended me I remember being in panic lest they come to my place and see there was no mother there.   As a consequence, I had no close friends.    By the time I was in Grammar School, amidst a new group of people, I made a determined effort to be extrovert.   I was. Flambuoyant, noisy, funny, everybody's friend, etc.   Inside, if anything, I was more secretive than ever, but I quickly made some firm friends (which I treasure today!), and, very gradually, I opened up [just a little] to them.    I am now old, and think often about my death.  My thoughts are not nice ones, though.   I worry that my family and friends, going through my effects when I am dead, will discover my 'hideous secrets'!   For that reason alone I caught myself destroying music that I have written, diaries, articles I have written, etc., etc.    Sorry about the autobiography, but it was intended to show that secretiveness comes in many guises.   As a Musician, as a lecturer, I am (to all appearances) self-confident, fun-loving, and friendly.   I don't feel dishonest, either, in adopting this role.    Character that was formed in our infancy is impossible to erase.   I know that my feelings of shame are unwarranted, but that does not remove my character.   I don't dare let anybody too close, I have discovered.   Not now, and never!    Do you know what?    I am not unhappy with the way I am, either!    Without boasting, I am a really fine actor (I've been in rehearsal most of my life, after all!), I rarely, if ever, become nervous during a performance (unlike almost any musician I know!), I am so very used to defensive retorts, that I am a reasonably witty conversationalist, etc., etc.    My Music Professor is the only person, as far as I know, that had an inkling of my true introverted nature, and he used this knowledge in the kindest way imaginable.   But when he died, I am ashamed to admit that I felt relief!     He taught me composition, he was the strongest influence on me as a young musician, and I venerated him, but he knew what was inside, my hideous 'secrets', so I felt relief when he died!  [I hate that about myself.]    My intellect tells me that there ARE no 'secrets'.     The little boy learned that there were, and to jealously guard what was inside.    I am still, inescapably, that little boy:  but it is rather amusing   -    when one thinks about it.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	They have something they don't want you to know about|`|CdTe8MO4aa	when there ready to open up to u they will let u know   intill then don't jump down there throats about it  let them breathe|`|rDMDRRihaa	Evolution?

What might have caused it? Well, it could be their own personality trait. This means that it is in their nature to be secretive. Nothing had caused it, they just don't like being too talkative about their private life.     Or like what others said, there might have been some instances in their life that had caused them to be more secretive. Take the others' examples mentioned above. ;)    edit: It's not only because they have been betrayed in the past, or lack of trust. There could be other things which had happened which caused them to be secretive. Or, the person may lack self-esteem which causes him/her to shy away from sharing his/her thoughts to other people. Oh there are lots of possible reasons.    Usually, there's nothing wrong with it. It is a matter of choice whether you want to share your personal life or not.|`|XyRoPkn5aa	none of ur business is the usual dialogue..but i personally think its a psychological prob..|`|8Mt0vgryaa	Because i'm stupid.

ZgIZrKi7aa	Keep in mind that feeling tired is all in your mind.   Think about this, when you are very interested in something, even if you are tired, you completely forget about being tired and pursue what you're interested in.  In effect you can extend how long you are awake fighting against the feeling of tiredness.  Eventually it will go away entirely (you get a "second wind").    What I'm saying is the best way to beat tiredness is to force your mind to push through - force yourself to ignore the tired feelings, and force your mind to concentrate on whatever task you need to, if it drifts just keep bringing your focus back.    Another thing that helps is drinking lots of water and tea.  Tea is better than coffee in this case, because it has a more moderate amount of caffeine so it helps keep you awake if you continually drink it.
6GmtcZteaa	Perhaps you feel better sitting in the dark. I know I do ! I like the peace and quiet at night .U the same ? Although i have a job so i got to leave the night alone most of the time lol.

I love everyone, and hate no one. your cousin sounds like some of the ones I went tjhru in life, and I alwauys told them to speak up as I cant hear you, and usually that corrects the problem. tell your cousin to speak up and to speak his mind, if it hurts someone, tell him or her that you do not mean to hurt their feelings, but that you are only saying what your opinions are. you get my drift?

Perhaps in your deepest creature the wavelength of energy of one field of thought is so very simlar to that of another, the brain is having an issue with where and how to file it effectively.   Overall the dream most likely means that you are seeing the residual visual effects of a particular nutrient deficiency which aids the brain in its ability to catagorize and recall.   I'd like to suggest you check your brain diet and make the necessary adjustments for the sake of your future career. :)
7tNL2qD5aa	The fact that you were able to open up and explain your emotions in a articulate way is something most people are not capable of doing. Failure in general, refers to the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, but to whose standards? Your silly teacher? A situation considered to be a failure by one might be considered a success by another...In this case, I think your teacher is a failure for failing to serve his/her duties as a normal teacher should.You however, are a success, smart young man whose attention should be concentrated on the things that matters the most to you and your life like writing a new book, another words fulfilling your dreams. Don't waste your time on them, taking the right decisions and arriving at the right conclusion in the present is the key to the quality of our experience in the future, don't for get that...

I know it seems very judgemental and unfair, but we can't really blame them, since language is the only thing you get to demonstrate to people on first impression.    You could probably try reading more books or improve on your spelling. Try not to do it solely on memory, but also phonetically; try to pronounce it slowly and properly, so that you may spell it correctly.
vAdtlZDpaa	As you stated, preganancy dreams symbolize an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.     To dream of jail suggests that you are feeling restrained or censored in your work environment, relationship or situation in your life. You are feeling confined and suffocated. Alternatively, it represents self-punishment and guilt from being involved in some wrong doing.    Medicine and the doctor both indicate your need for emotional and spiritual healing.     I think all three of these symbols tied together relate to some new phase in your life that you are conflicted about. On the one hand you you are ready to move forward (heavily pregnant), but on the other hand you are worried about the (emotional) pain that will be caused by "giving birth" to a new aspect of your personality, and you also don't feel that you will have the support that you want (all the other pregnant women had a partner with them except for you). Finally, you feel that some kind of restrictions are preventing you from moving ahead but that this transition is important emotional and spiritual healing.|`|AA10109143	Your dream mean something will happen that will involve you and your doctor and in some reason you will ask a question to her and you will see her soon.Dream is just to let you know that your gonna see your doctor soon.

First off, "failing" is a fairly subjective term, what constitutes "failing", and at what, equity, efficiency? How recent is recent? 10 years, 100 years? Also, capitalism and free enterprise are two terms for the same economic system, so A and C are the same answer. Lastly communism is not an economic system, it's an entire socioeconomic philosophy, like fascism or libertarianism. Socialism would be a more correct answer for an economic system.

533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	What does being a dainty 17 yr. old girl have to do with anything? It's kinda like saying "well, if you're black, you can't be President." (oops, that was true before Obama came along, hee hee.)    The physical space we occupy is only partly who we are. The psychological space we occupy, the person we desired to be when we grew up, the dreams we still have nestling inside of us, all of those factors also go into who we are. And these other factors can often come out in our dreamscape.    My question to you is: how do you feel when you are doing all that fighting and killing? My guess is that it feels pretty good. You think of yourself differently in your head because you, your dreams, give yourself permission to be more than either you, or anyone else around you, thinks you are.     There is a line in the movie Wanted that is appropriate here "If no one told you that bullets flew straight, and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target, what would you do?

Two things though, that I've done that seem to make people a little more accepting of economic theory:    1) Don't state opinions.  Economic theory has no opinions.  All economic theory does is tell you the consequences of your decisions.  Frame your points in "if you want to accomplish this and this, you must do this" ways.  Those statements are, in fact, facts if developed by economic theory.    2) Let them ask you what you think about something.

Development is in poor countries a problem for economists that are engineers or engineers that are economists. In Europe and USA, development science has never been taken seriously mainly because we export to underdeveloped countries goods they wouldnt buy if they could advance further in development matters.

You are correct that there is sometimes a bond between people who have the same afflictions, like the loss of hearing, and who are able to communicate together through sign.  This is never a given that this leads to tight friendships though, it's just something all hearing impared people have in common.    From your description, it seems that regardless of whether this person is deaf or not, he lives somewhat beyond the fringes of normalcy, with some really eccentric tastes.  I think you have an expectation that he would be accepted by other deaf people just by virtue of the fact that he is deaf, regardless of how he lives his life and what he enjoys -- which doesn't seem to be the case here.    It's just my suggestion that even if he were able to hear, and not have to use sign language (if he does), you might be asking the same questions about what the deal is with this guy in your photography class who has such eccentric tastes that people find him hard to understand, get to know, relate to him, think he's an aloof jerk, etc.    As for your question about why he is like he is?  Who knows?  Everyone has their "things", albeit they usually don't involve gas masks and bondage, but sometimes they do.  Most just don't share their "things" with others.  As someone who expresses himself through his photography, he puts all of his "things" out there for everyone to see.    So, my suggestion to this long ramble is that being deaf has nothing to do with his eccentricities.  It sounds like if he weren't deaf, he would still have issues with acceptance by others.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Cause|`|dROCIoimaa	i don't think he has any kind of issue   everyone is different from what you may think is normal  maybe you should try not to think so hard about him =]|`|AA10125270	I can think of a couple reasons for this.  First is that he was not raised around other Deaf people.  Some hearing parents place their children in schools that have no other Deaf children and do not get involved in the Deaf Community.  Another reason I can think of is the Deaf Community is a conformist community.  Those who are different are often gossiped about and made to feel unwanted.  By you description of the man in your class, he is different.  He may choose not to be a part of the Deaf Community and not associate with in it. The best way to know, is to ask him "Do you know so-and-so?"  or something similar to that.

Mnmw1tzAaa	1. Let's just say I made a complete fool of myself on a debate forum. I said things that should've been said. I realize now that what I said was complete and udder bullsh*t. They all make fun of me now. Because of that one debate we had. I didn't realize what I was saying. And because they're all older than me, they all make fun of me. I can never go back to the forum because of it. They banished me from their site. All because of what I said. And although it seems lame that I'm upset over internet friends, it's put me in a world of pain. It hurts.    2. I'll watch what I say. Because it cost me a dear friend.    3.Yes. I wish more than ever that I could go back in time and stop myself from posting on that forum. I was an idiot. I was an absolute idiot.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	There are no mistakes in my life. Everything that has happened was meant to be that way. I live life with no regrets.|`|zujPAY10aa	1. I talked back and disrespected my teachers last year, significantly. Now I feel dumb, rude, immature, and embarrassed (just to name a few).    2. Yes, I try to respect and have a higher outlook about people and swallow my pride more often.     3. NEVER. If I changed even the tiniest thing in my life I wouldn't be where I am today and I could be off a lot worse.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	1. the biggest mistake is I gave up in between, I did not wait, I lost patience  2.  Yes I have changed, I gained patience, I wait, but I am falling into another trap, I wait too long and the trend changes, and I loose  3. yes, if I could work the clock backward I could go back and rectify these errors, but in the long term I feel it does not matter. U could be richer by a few dollars, but u may also loose the dollars on the way.|`|NRiuGQvIaa	biggest mistake was probably hanging out with the wrong crowd growing up & yup I have changed but still seem to fall under the same  road over & over if I was given to change the hands of time it would be  to change those friends & be more focus reaching sucess|`|tCVYl6ecaa	too nice. Focused on verbal language while overlooked non-verbal language.|`|H2oCXK35aa	I don't know if I continue, even today, always liking myself. But what I learned to do many years ago was to forgive myself. It is very important for every human being to forgive herself or himself because if you live, you will make mistakes- it is inevitable. But once you do and you see the mistake, then you forgive yourself and say, 'well, if I'd known better I'd have done better,' that's all. So you say to people who you think you may have injured, 'I'm sorry,' and then you say to yourself, 'I'm sorry.' If we all hold on to the mistake, we can't see our own glory in the mirror because we have the mistake between our faces and the mirror; we can't see what we're capable of being. You can ask forgiveness of others, but in the end the real forgiveness is in one's own self. I think that young men and women are so caught by the way they see themselves. Now mind you. When a larger society sees them as unattractive, as threats, as too black or too white or too poor or too fat or too thin or too sexual or too asexual, that's rough. But you can overcome that. The real difficulty is to overcome how you think about yourself. If we don't have that we never grow, we never learn, and sure as hell we should never teach.
lOp75aGUaa	When confronted with the genuineness of oneself it's pretty normal to feel inferior. Calm down.     Don't worry so much bout what these people are saying. If they're your friends they don't sound like they are very good ones, and if they aren't your friends why do you care what they say?    People will criticize, it'll happen, and this won't be the last time. You just gotta learn to take these things in stride.    Just take it easy and shrug it off. Nobody is like god of originality brimming with original thought and sweating creativity. Everybody cops an image/idea from somebody. Just chill. they're not innocent.|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	You can not do anything.  People are always going to talk no matter if your the best person in the world.  You need to do whats best for you.  When I was young Between family and everyone they know I was called every name in the book.  I never showed them how it made me feel.  I cried in my room alone.  I decided that I would be better than all of them.  I ran away from home at the age of 9 and went into the system.  I did school and work.  I know have everything I want and they ask me for thing and I am very happy to say NO.  I mean that DO NOT LET ANYONE GET TO YOU.  In the long run by making the right choices you will be better.  And without all the crap your going through you will not be who your destined to become.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Thank people for calling you bad names. They maybe surprised but tell them I thank God I am not bad as you are. Don't feel sad you are not that bad. Don't focus on yourself. You should see other people's conducts. They are more bad than you. Inferiority complex is of the devil. He wants you to rebel. But you have to resist the devil. Tell yourself that you are not the kind of person he wants to be. Tell him that you want to be a child of God. You know what it is all in the mind. If you think you are that bad then you can do bad things easily but if you want things to be good you have to do good things. So shun the devil when he is making you feel you're down. Keep telling yourself I am a good guy and no one can't stop me for doing good. Yes you have to be strong and determined to do what is right and God will be with you at all times. God Bless!|`|giH1kGziaa	listing this bad words and remember and thinking what are you done wrong and compere  what are you done and normal people in your case and remember this words and thinking before any do thing and important ask always time and trying learner .|`|21ymg23Oaa	Hello,     I'm sorry you are feeling so sad.   I would be feeling sad too if people were saying things like that to me.  Who are these people?   Can you avoid them at all?   Also I wonder if you can find someone to talk to like a counsellor perhaps? Feelings of low self-esteem can really screw up how we feel about everything. A counsellor will listen and support you without judging you and help you to find out things about yourself which are good and worthy of respect not scorn from others.   Everything you tell a counsellor is confidential too. And if money is an obstacle there are often places where people on low income can pay what they can afford.   One quality you have which means you are not stupid is that you can ask for help.     Good Luck,   Alison|`|kRs6ksqNaa	let the dogs bark.

533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	I find it interesting that what you consider your 'strength' in life (manipulating people) is really practiced on people who have no control or power over you. That suggests that your desire for manipulation, for control, stems from your lack of control when it comes to this relationship.    Maybe the reason you are having such a hard time with this relationship is that you are still thinking its about some form of manipuation, some form of control that you can exercise to make things happen.    If you stop and think, you will see that the happiest parts of your life aren't things you set out to control. What made you happy was you being yourself and hanging around this guy, simply being around him. None of that sounds, to me, like it involves issues of manipulation and power-struggles, except your own struggle to accept and deal with these overwhelming feelings.    And you really don't know him. That is what crushes are all about, not knowing. Thinking about him every single day doesn't bring you one iota closer to him because all you are doing is psychological laps in your own head. Relationships are built on interacting with another person. If all you are doing is mooning over him from afar, that isn't going to make anything you desire come true.    The real question is: why is he distant from you? Some people grow up with certain ideas about somebody, and find it hard to change how they think about that person, or even if they are capable of changing how they feel. If he really doesn't feel anything for you, and just thinks of you as someone he's known since childhood, then you choosing him to crush on is really just another way for you to try and gain power for yourself. This is a feather in your cap if you turn him "See, look how powerful I am. I made someone who didn't feel anything fall in looooooove with me. I'm so good." That isn't love either, that's just deep insecurity.    The question you have to ask yourself is: am I in love or am I just looking for something to boost my ego? Love means a willingness to put the games and the manipulation away in order to have a real relationship. If you can't do that, you already have your answer.|`|YZhD94WEaa	" I notice. When a kind gesture happens, and no one notices... I notice. I know that doesn't make a person."     I just want to compliment YOU for beeing able to notice these types of things, far too many people dont appreciate anything, the fact that you can, to me, means you must be a beautiful person.    You cant force something like this to happen, you cant make someone fall in love with you.|`|4WbYCWbCaa	If that so, this time...you would have a difficulities to make this person fall in love with you. I've already been in your situation. in my life, that guy is older than me. From what you had said, i know you have a good personalities tht can attract peoples to be  friend with ya. People will look at you in your group. Hm... to make your childhood friend fall in love to you.. lets just say... 50 percent chances. cuz, they know you better from a long ago. if he love you, you can easily detect it with your instinct.  but if he doesnt show any interest in you... you should plan your act and act naturaly. remember this. manupulating people with ease need a natural and innocent personality. Do show yourself and talk with him. be with him but not always. dont be too cheapy but dont try him too long as he can find someone. Just try simple way, so he will slowly feel he like you. others, depends on you.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Well, if you want a real relationship based on love and trust, get rid of the manipulation thoughts. Be yourself. It will happen or it won't. He knows your there, Just wait it out. Maybe you are trying too hard.

oqI7H1T9aa	Peabody Individual Achievement Test -- Revised  Purpose: Designed to obtain a survey of an individuals scholastic attainment.    Population: Grades K-12.    Score: Scores in six content areas.    Time: Untimed.    Author: Frederick C. Markwardt, Jr.    Publisher: American Guidance Service.    Description: The Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT-R) is the revised version of the now classic Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT), an individually administered, norm-referenced measure of academic achievement. The test was designed to provide a wide-range screening measure in six content areas that can be used with students in kindergarten through the 12th grade.    Scoring: The content areas covered by the PIAT-R are 1) General Information, 2) Reading Recognition, 3) Reading Comprehension, 4) Mathematics 5) Spelling and 6) Written Expression.    Reliability: Split-half reliability of the PIAT-R ranges from .84 for kindergarten Mathematics to .98 for third-grade Reading Recognition. The median split-half reliability for the total test is .98. With three exceptions, all at age 5, Kuder-Richardson reliabilities all cluster in the low to mid-90s, indicating a high degree of content homogeneity. Test-retest reliabilities for 2- to 4-week periods range in the low to upper .90s for composite correlations and in the mid-.80s to high .90s for individual subtests. The interrater reliabilities for Level II Written Expression range from .49 for Grades 5 and 8 to .81 for Grade 11.    Validity: Content validity of the PIAT-R was established through the selection of items in the test. It is believed that the rigorous item selection used in the development of the PIAT-R supports adequate content validity. Construct validity was established by three methods: 1) by developmental changes, the extent to which test scores show an increase with age or grade; 2) by correlations with other tests, including the original FIAT (median r = .88 for the total test) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (median r = .72); and 3) factor analytic techniques.    Norms: The total sample was composed of 1,563 students from 33 communities, 100 to 150 from each grade (K-12), and an additional 159 from the kindergarten level. These students were selected randomly from public school classrooms (91.4%) and 11 private schools, and they were balanced according to sex (49.9% male, 50.1%), age, race (73.3% white, 14.3% black, 9.7% Hispanic, 3.2% other), and socioeconomic level.    Suggested uses: Designed to assess student achievement in educational or research settings.

Just try not to be akward about it.|`|8miMWB64aa	Depends on the woman.  Technically, no, I think it's against their religion, but I doubt most people adhere to their religion perfectly.  Still, it may be worth asking, just in case they do.    Technically, if she was very strict in her adherence, she'd have to kill people who don't follow her religion.|`|096b7gBHaa	Beep and Arrogance are crapping over empty sources.     most girls like to be complimented. the only problem is when the compliment reaches a state of harassment, or if it is by a guy that the girl doesn't fancy. even for any girls and regardless what they wear, getting compliments from guys  they don't like and in the way they don't feel comfortable with would somewhat be disturbing. for example if it's a pervert driving test officer who said it out of nowhere.     therefore it should go the same to the girl.     i know some muslim girls who feel less attractive for wearing hijab and doesn't feel good with it, so a little compliments would work good, i guess.    but for some of them who feel comfortable thinking of themselves as somebody less attractive, they would usually feel better without compliment, since they're enjoying freedom from bigger harassments.    and i also know many Muslim women who don't seem to feel down by wearing hijab, yet they can still be confident enough about their beauty. they don't reallycare whether people compliment or not, since they have confidence enough.     acceptable or not, i think it's how she would take it. if it was me, i think i won't mind if guys say it's nice, while to compliment in a way that doesn't mean anything much, more like how a fashion designer would compliment, not as a guy who's sexually attracted to a girl.     she might be wearing hijab, but she's not a nun though.     but the easiest way is that you can stop staring at any girls so there's nothing to ponder about.|`|UOz1LPIHaa	If she's often wearing something that's green, the odds are that she personally likes it for the same reasons you're thinking of complimenting her for.      I'd probably say something if you know her halfway well that she wouldn't take it the wrong way. . . such as that you were laughing at it or trying to make a point that she's different.  If you think it'd come across as "really, I think that looks nice on you" sincere, I'd guess it would be nice.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	Well of course, duh!

Vakup5Jvaa	Meditation will help, try going places that sooth you ...a lake, a pond.    Like panic attacks the more you think about it the worse it gets. Its not in your mind, but concentrating on it will only add to it. Tell someone what your feeling ..when your feeling it, if they seem disinterested do not take it personal. Some people deal with things differently.. some by tuning out. Just try someone else, you may find comfort where you least expect it.    And lastly killing yourself is never an answer it only leaves the problems with the ones you love. It will not teach them anything but leave a hole in their life, and they will grieve every day. They will never stop hurting. So please don't do it OK?  Thank You    Best of luck|`|dxo8DT55aa	Perhaps city life brings to much anxiety for you :( maybe consider moving to somewhere that is more peaceful and relaxing ?|`|My2aEyK5aa	Ignore Pocket...that is only suicide...channel into the Bass Guitar...that is the path.|`|Ksriqfqpaa	PLEASE  dont kill urself  if i learned one thing in life its that NOTHiNG is as bad as it seems  try talk to a friend or parent about this  this is NOT permanet   only a temperarly mishap|`|OCWm9IiJaa	It sounds like anxiety is your problem and not your heart, if I had your problem I would improve my spiritual life,  do you believe in God?

Just wait and see.|`|QhwrNuaHaa	What does killing yourself solve? You're just turning 18. You have a whole life ahead of you, even if you can't say how long it may be. Why throw all that away?    I don't know the details of your heart condition, but I can understand it making you anxious. You feel like you might die whenever your heart gets to racing. You're consumed by the anxiety, and the only way you can make the anxiety go away is with the medication, but that doesn't fix the heart condition, so you feel like you're really not solving anything.     But look at it this way. Your heart is racing. Sure, that might mean your condition is getting to you, and sure, you don't know what's going to happen, but you've made it up to this point. You're still here. You haven't dropped dead of it while typing that, and to me that says that chances are you're not likely to in the immediate future. You need to relax and look at this objectively.     You let yourself be consumed by this anxiety - and I bet that in no small part contributes to making your heart race in the first place. From what you say, this anxiety makes things get so bad you feel like killing yourself to make it stop, but this anxiety is based in your thoughts of death. In essence, you want to kill yourself over your anxiety over death? You know that doesn't make sense.    You're not going to make the heart condition go away, but it doesn't consume and paralyze you the way your anxiety does. The anxiety is your problem here - you're not dead of this heart problem yet, so I'd say you get on fine with it. So don't sweat having to take the pharmaceuticals. You need some help beating back this anxiety problem, and they work. That's what they're for. Just take them the way you're supposed to and don't worry about the heart thing. If you spend all your time worrying about what MIGHT happen, then all the things that DO happen will just pass you right on by.    Just keep going. It's worth it. Life always is.|`|Wv2mOlQwaa	im sorry to hear you feel this way ,but your not the only one who has anxiety attacks. i used to have them too, years back(when i was 16). but you know what? is all in your mind if you want to get cured from those anxiety attacks, YOU HAVE TO CONTROLL YOUR MIND, DON'T LET YOUR MIND CONTROL YOU. you have to stop thinking negative thoughts, breath, relax, stop worrying, live life at the fullest today without thinking about tomorrow. be happy find things to motivate you in life.I HATED TO HAVE ANXIETY ATTACKS THAT I GOT SO MAD AND GOT STRONG AND SAID "IM MORE STRONGER THAN MY BRAIN, I CONTROL IT, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME ANYMORE" AND IT DIDNT.

vAdtlZDpaa	In the eastern cultures, dragons are seen as spiritual creatures symbolizing good luck and fortune.    To see a dragon in your dream, signifies that you tend to let yourself get carried away by your passion. Since the dragon in your dream was outside and you were observing it from inside, I think that symbolizes a detachment from your passion. Windows represent our viewpoint or way of perceiving life and the world.     The color silver represents justice and purity. It is symbolic of some protective energy.|`|OCWm9IiJaa	It was the devil looking for a way to get you to sin, so be good and guard against all sin against God|`|YKPeQwGraa	C-O-O-L   awesome dream buddy

uhchod38aa	I don't know about Adam and Eve, although Christianity uses this story to blame Eve (and all women) for original sin. Part of God's punishment was to greatly increase the pain of childbirth. The fact that this story has Eve created out of Adam's rib to be his helper gives her a subordinate position from the beginning. What's interesting is that Genesis contains more than one creation story. Genesis 1:27 reads:     "So God created man in his own image,          in the image of God he created him;          male and female he created them."    The story of Adam being created first and Eve second out of his rib was written later. The thing to remember is that the Old Testament (or what the Jews consider to be the Bible) was written over thousands of years.You can't talk about Christianity without talking about Judaism because Jewish religious law is the basis for Christianity.    St. Paul wrote over half of the New Testament. Many people believe that he can be held responsible for placing women in a subordinate position, although it can be argued that when they do this, they are taking him out of context. I do remember reading about a hundreds-of-years-ago religious debate concerning whether or not women had souls or were fully human as men are, which in part goes back to the whole rib thing.     St. Paul, was born and raised a Jew. Much of what he brought to Christianity is based in Jewish religious law. Leviticus, for example, instructs the ancient Hebrews that a woman is unclean after the birth of a child. If the child is a girl, she is unclean for approximately twice as long as if the child is a boy. I don't actually know the reason for this rule, but taken out of the original context, all by itself it seems sexist.     So while I think that much of sexism can be placed squarely at the feet of Jewish-Christian-Islamic traditions, teachings, and beliefs, at least some of what people hold to be sexist in these texts actually comes from taking the texts out of context. For example, in 1Cor 11:7-12, and I'm paraphrasing here, St. Paul writes that while the man is the image and glory of God, the woman is the glory of the man. Maybe this seems sexist all by itself. He goes on to explain in 1Cor 11:12 that     "as the woman is OF the man,   even so is the man also BY the woman;   but ALL things OF God,"     which implies to me that men and women are both subordinate to God and equal in His sight. I digress a little.    The last thing I'm going to say about this is that sexism grew out of a need to control a woman's reproduction. I imagine to ancient people, reproduction was a mystery. As they began to figure out that men did play a role in reproduction, it became necessary to to to control woman's reproduction. As men began to lay claim to land ownership, for example, they would have felt it necessary to insure that their property was passed down to the actual fruit of their loins. Thus it became necessary to insure virginity in women before they married, and to inforce fidelity in their wives.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't think the 20s (if you are refering to the 1920s) was a particularly active decade for women's rights.  Women in the USA got the vote in 1920, and thereafter interest in women's rights seems to have declined sharply, with the women's rights movement splintering into al ot of different small factions, and a great many people losing interest altogether.    Most societies throughout history have been male-dominated, and generally it has been men who have occupied leadership roles.  When democracy was first developed, in ancient Greece, only free male citizens were actively involved in the process of government.  This continued to be the situation during the succeeding centuries.  Gnerally, it has been assumed in most societies for most of history that politics is men's business.    The legal rights that women have had have varied considerably from society to society over the years.  women had more legal rights in ancient Egypt than in ancient Greece for example, and in early medieval Europe they had more rights than in the late medieval and early modern period.  Their legal rights did not generally involve exercising political roles though. They still lived in societies in which leadership roles were overwhelmingly held by men, but women were able to exercise considerable power as queens, for instance, and sometimes as landholders in their own right, and in Saxon England for example, there were a number of powerful abbesses who ruled over double monasteries (communities of both monks and nuns).  Generally women in positions of power were women of royal or noble families.    Another important point to consider is that, in most societies until quite recently, a lot of men had very limited rights.  In the UK for example, most men did not get the vote until the late 19th century.  The concept of 'equal rights' as encompassing everyone, regardless of gender, race, class etc, is a comparatively recent one.  For much of history most men (and some women) did not feel that politics was a woman's business.  For that matter, for most of history it was assumed that only the ruling class was fit to exercise political judgement.    Despite some of the claims made above, you will find that even in hunter-gatherer societies, leadership roles are generally held by men, and men are considered to be the heads of the families.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	The Celts granted women fairly even rights.    When Christianity hit Europe, so did the notion that women were dangerous tempters of men. All land went to men, as the husbands and custodians of women.

Perhaps it is for the same reason that classism develops so easily in post-civilized society or racism in imperialist societies--it's just the obvious way of controlling the people that don't have as much power.    It's so old and the justifications given for it are so diverse (ie every misogynist society has their own cultural reason for it)...it's impossible to be more specific than that.|`|ROdHsYVAaa	The stuff I've read blames the medevil Catholic church - basically the church was male dominated and if they conceeded that women were more powerful (in society at the time, they kinda were...all that ability to reproduce) they faced being shut out of control. So they wrote into the church cannons a "perfect" woman, Mary, who never had sex, and had the savior of the world... eventually the made sex bad, women bad and reproduction dirty.  It all seemed to peak with the Victorians...    But I've had like 3 pints of Guiness.

Then the polticians and bureaucrats  who, in the name of liberalism and freedom, legislated throughout the 19th century and the early 20th century, so that women had no control over their  a)wealth  b)income   c)children   d)bodies  nor rights to enter the public sphere -  that is to enter politics, to vote, to borrow capital, to access most forms of higher education, nor to enter professions and careers,or even to engage in public sociallife for example by walking in public alone or of something simple like entering a pub as a single woman.    See especially the work of the feminist historians of philosophy -Susan Moller Okin, Genevieve Lloyd, Carol Pateman    They also show how women's freedom was restricted too in the work of the earlier Greek philosphers|`|gYbe3BNeaa	No Adam, no Eve.    For most of human history we have been gatherer-hunters.  Gatherer-hunter societies are the most egalitarian of all societies.  Scientists have discovered that ancient gatherer-hunter peoples derived the bulk of their caloric intake  from foods like tubers, roots, berries, eggs, etc. - the stuff the women gathered.  Women kept the clan alive, and they were pretty much equal to men.  When you look at our history on the planet inequality is actually a fairly recent phenomena.  As societies grew ever larger women's power correspondingly decreased - but now in our post-industrial society its on the way back up.    There are:  - gatherer-hunter societies  - horticultural societies  - herding societies  - fishing societies  - agrarian societies (LEAST EGALITARIAN SOCIETY)  - industrial societies  - post-industrial societies|`|5ihxuqLMaa	Uhhhh. It probably comes from the fact that men can take women. Duh    And there's the church. Off coarse good answer above.

ToILKl6waa	Yes, I've had a similar feeling. When we hear songs beyond our liking, the music begins to fit our negative perception or the overwhelming dreads we face.   I usually drain the music out with different songs that help to put me in a better mood. Or I just tell myself that it will be over soon and play a song in my head/talk to myself.     If I were you, I would bring earphones of some sort or my own music. Or you can ask your mate what other music he likes, and see if that music is good for you.    And last, don't see your job so negatively. No matter what it is, you have the power to be happy with it. Perhaps if you try to see the lighter side of your job, the songs won't bother you quite so much.|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	try having ur own mp3 player with earphones so u can avoid the songs played by ur flatmate.   and it is very normal to associate 2 things together!
meR4smlSaa	There's a lot you can do, you could just chill and think. You could go outside and take deep breathes, or hang out with friends...or you could do it the fun way: hypnotize yourself. Do this by sitting on your bed. Tell yourself not to move, just relax, you feel each part of your body becomming loose and limp. Start at your head and work your way down to your feet. Then tell yourself that your arm is becomming so light and limp that it's rising into the air. If   your arms are riaing tell yourself that they're  getting heavy again and sinking back to your  body. Now give yourself a comand like relax  or don't worry so much about school. Or another fun thing is magick. Write a spell on your own using your own energy, if you get one someone else wrote it won't work as well... It must Ryme...I don't know why LOL that's just a rule, anyway as your saying your spell imagine yourself becomming less and less stressed. Focus on your spell. Nothing else. If you worry it won't work it won't, you must believe it will, trust me i've cast spells that wouldn't work because I worried it wouldn't work. Now don't expect immediate results it'll take a day or few. Mail me if you want more info!! :)|`|jR0GYS0waa	Yoga is an excellent stress relief technique.

It helps people who have seasonal affective disorder and don't get enough sun in the winter time. My pharmacist who is very knowledgeable suggests at least 2,000 i.u. a day.     Valerian root is also good as well as chamomile tea. There are herbal teas you can get from the health food store specifically to help you relax and sleep. Meditation is a great way to relieve stress and you can get meditation C.D's to help you.     Sometimes when I am stressed at work, I will go into the bathroom and do mini meditations by closing my eyes, taking in a deep breath and just focusing on my breathing for a minute or two. It helps to reduce the stress. You can even visualize yourself at a beach while doing this as your subconscious mind doesn't know whats real or not, and it's what controls your body functions.    I find physical exercise is great for stress too.  Going for a brisk walk and repeating positive phrases is great too.  Sometimes when I am stressed I will go for a brisk walk and repeat phrases I learned from a Tony Robbins C.D.  I say in rhythm to my walking, "Every day and every way I'm feeling happier and happier, yes!"  I may change the phrase as well by saying "Every day and every way I'm feeling better and better yes."  I also touch each of my fingertips while saying this while walking as it "anchors" it to my subconscious mind.    I also have a gratitude list and write what I'm grateful for even when I'm not feeling grateful.    I hope this is helpful,    Good Luck,    Michelle,    http://www.stressandyourhealth.org
YCA6JBvbaa	Dreams always have some connection to the way you think or the way you feel about things.  This is no different.    In your life you are enjoying a relationship like a boyfriend, best friend, parent, mentor, etc....  But you also feel the relationship changing.   With the change that you feel you also feel a sense of uncertainty about the future of your relationship.  Many people have these dreams when they are about to go through divorce or a break up or someone going off to college or moving away.  It is your brain giving you the opportunity to practice the feeling of loss that you believe is coming.  (Usually very intense for people that have big hearts)    I wish you well and don't worry about the name Gory.|`|k86KdyYOaa	Aww that's a sad dream.  But honestly, I have no idea.  Sorry :(|`|vAdtlZDpaa	To see a baby in your dream signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.  Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted. If you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential. Since you lost the baby in your dream, perhaps it means you lost the ability to tap into your hidden potential, or something happened in your waking life that made you feel as though you have lost your innocence.    To dream that you are searching for something signifies the need to find something that is missing or needed in your life. You may be searching for love, spiritual enlightenment, peace or even a solution to a problem.    I wish I knew the symbolism of the baby's name, but I can't help you there. Does it sound to you like anything familiar in your waking life?
vnSskmVRaa	The very best thing The Secret has done for me is to help me be crystal clear about exactly what I want.  Answering the question, "What do you really want?" is actually very difficult for most people.  But watching The Secret led me down a path of self-inquiry to uncover my core desires.  Now that I know them, and they inspire my passion, it is easy to think about them often and keep them at the forefront of my mind.  I am working towards financial and career goals, health and weight goals, and relationship goals, and making progress towards each one.  I have to suspect that the delay I experience in receiving many of these things has to do with my limiting beliefs, which I'm also working on.

But i haven't recieved anything else i've been wanting. It doesn't mean i'm fully skeptical of it - i think the basic rule makes perfect sense. However i believe it's best to stay grounded with this sort of thing.    In the audio version they were discussing how, if you were wanting to recover from an illness you have to visualize yourself healthy and fully cleansed of whatever illness it is you have - to the extent where they were basically saying you should ignore it and not talk to anyone about it at all. I think that that itself is completely unhealthy, people are meant to worry and grieve when finding themselves with a severe illness, at least at first.     Just remember to be sensible about a lot of this and that most things come to fruition with a combination of both physical and mental effort, because the law of attraction on it's own just sounds downright wishy washy.|`|SDsjXed2aa	Like magic. But think about it, there are a lot of stuff you used to do even before reading the book / watching the movie.    When it's something that has to do with being in a good mood, I understand very well how it works. But for other things, I really don't know how it works. All I know, is that it works.    Obviously you won't get everything you ask for. I'd like to get a free ticket to the moon. But that doesn't mean that it's not effective.
AA11966821	Obama's "stimulus" package can only delay the inevitable and make it "worser longer."  Instead of letting the insolvent banks and mismanaged companies go, to be replaced by sound banks and well managed companies, he's determined to prop them up at taxpayers' expense.  This can only lead to higher tax burdens and ultimately more jobs lost without being replaced.      FDR was elected after the stock market had already bottomed, and he proceeded to put the country on a track that vastly prolonged the Depression, added millions to the ranks of the unemployed (thanks to Smoot-Hawley), generated a second stock market collapse, and burdened taxpayers for generations.  Obama is idiotically following the worst of FDR's precedents he could possibly do.  So instead of a short, sharp recession with a fairly rapid recovery, it could easily take a decade or two to fully recover.  He is creating new bubbles in the economy, which have to burst (all bubbles must burst -- no alternative!).  Worse, he has left us with no alternative but printing money, which can only generate very high inflation, even hyperinflation, and risks the total destruction of the dollar.  By spending money we do not have, he is exacerbating the cause of the crisis -- too much debt.    Thus, either the stimulus is "effective" and results in more debt bubbles, hyperinflation and collapse, or is "ineffective" and results in ever-deepening depression, increasing unemployment, and unbearable tax burdens.  Unfortunately, most Americans haven't a clue as to economics, thus look for a "savior," and he ain't it.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	we are in a depression|`|dvevk1qbaa	Obamas stimulus works! he has two kids!|`|FYnI8VsLaa	Then we're way more in debt than we were before he signed the stupid thing.

Taxes will increase for people making an already obscene amount of money. This is unlike Bush's stimulus of last year which basically cut people a check hoping they would spend it on goods to boost the economy. Sadly, most people probably used it to pay bills or pay off credit cards which already had purchased goods. Obama's plan sounds much riskier than it is, but in these times it is necessary.|`|6Z9boBsyaa	http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01...    Above is a link to a chart on what the economy would look like had there been no stimulus compared to what it would look with a stimulus based on Obama's economic team's research. So to answer your question it would likely fall somewhere in there, depending on how ineffective it is.    Now to the 2nd point. As a certain someone in this area apparently slept through their history course. Otherwise they would've likely remembered that between 1933 through 1936 the unemployment rates fell from 25% down to 14%. It wasn't until FDR decided to appease the fiscal conservatives by cutting spending and balance the budget in '37 which created another recession and pushed unemployment back down to 20%, that the economy struggled.    And all of that spending WWII just killed our economy...

I'm sure that you know the meaning  but to reiterate,,, unconditional love is to love without rules and boundaries. There are no contingencies when it comes to unconditional love.

You want/need that person in your life no matter what you look like or what they look like, no matter if they smoke, or curse, or belch, or tell stupid stories...

It was shocking, and he is such an enormous influence on my life and my role model. I was so afraid that he was going to die. It didn't help that I found out while at a poker tournament - I basically broke down right there, and I couldn't even drive myself home. I cried for hours on end.    He's okay now - alive and as crazily active as ever - but just seeing that the person who you think is invincible and can handle everything have such a serious, life-threatening issue is extremely hard. I only went to the hospital to visit him once while he was there - partially because I was busy taking care of his business for him, but mostly because I personally couldn't handle seeing him like that - it just caused me to break down, and that wasn't helping him feel any better either.|`|qA0VCdn5aa	This Morning.

I've been troubled by this in the past and still have the same thing happening now sometimes.   Shaking is a natural, physical response to fear.   When a deer has been chased by a lion, once the danger has passed, it will stand still and shake all over until all the tension and fear has been released from its body.   Your body is doing the same thing.   There are even shaking meditations which encourage people to shake all the physical tension and fear out of themselves.   I recommend that you don't try to control them. And also don't exaggerate the shaking either. Just let them shake.   If it really bothers you, maybe you could find a counsellor to talk to? I did that too and it really helped me.   Good Luck,     Alison
cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	No. Having a terrible childhood makes some people really hard and cold, but it makes other people really sensitive. Although, interestingly, sometimes those sensitive people have an amazing underlying courage and strength. Anyway, having a hard time later in life can cause similar effects, but these things tend to have a larger affect if they happen earlier in life. Yet, having a hard time later in life (esp. if it's extreme or prolonged), or being traumatized enough can still cause the same effects in adults, although the same things prob. would have been more likely to cause a more extreme reaction in a child. What is enough to cause this in a person, depends on the person. Different people have different degrees of sensitivity and also have different ways of handling things, diff. protection mechanisms, etc. Furthermore, some people are just chemically and genetically/physically predispositioned to "turning hard". I believe genetics make someone more likely to become this way sometimes, and then the environment can either be a nice environment where the switch never gets flipped or it can be a harsh environment, where that switch is flipped. For example, I do think it might be possible for a sociopath to be born even if their environment is nice. However, I do think some people are born with a predisposition to becoming sociopaths, but have a chance at avoiding it. Then they end up in a bad home life, for example, and their young brains are more suscpeptible to trauma and change (trauma can literally alter a kid's brain's wiring) and that harsh environment/abuse/trauma is the catalyst for setting it off and making that potential problem they were predisposed to, manifest.    It reminds me of an autoimmune disease. I had a disease which some people think can be autoimmune, but not necessarily in all cases. However, I think there has to be some genetic predisposition to it, because the things that trigger it do not trigger it in all people. Even basic changes in hormones (such as pregnancy) can trigger the disease in some women, so obviously these women are diff. than other women who get pregnant for no prob. But while I was genetically predisposed to getting the illness (better now, by the way, thankfully), I would not have gotten the illness if I had avoided the trigger. In the case of some kids who turn out to be sociopaths, I think that's what happened to them. They were gentically predisposed, but might have been fine, if it hadn't been for a triggering environment.    But you can definitely turn hard later on, especially if you have a certain brain wiring and chemistry to start with I think. Diff. people come out differently when put through the same situation. Some abused kids turn into abusers, others are very loving, empathic people. Also, while war must affect everyone involved in it, unless they're a total sociopath to start with (in my opinion), it affects some more than others. Some people come back and they can go on with their lives, but some people completely break down, and some become hardened by it. We are often desensitized to what we are exposed to, too often. It's a psychological defense mechanism, in my opinion.    Also, physical trauma to the head can cause severe personality changes, as well. Plus, some people who seem emotionally "normal" in their younger years sometimes develop mental illness in their later years that emotionally affects them.    Anyway, as I said, I think hard childhoods can cause some people to be hardened, and hard lives as adults can cause the same in some other people, and some people might be hard naturally, or might turn hard more easily just because of their brain structure/wiring and their hormones/chemical balance, etc. I know people who are somewhat hard and they didn't have bad childhoods and they didn't have bad lives as adults, either. Also, I want to add here that I believe even emotional neglect as a kid (if the parents don't show the baby love) can cause kids to grow up lacking empathy and having trouble bonding with others.    Flashing back for a second to saying emotional/mental trauma alters kids' brains- it may alter adult brains, too, since our brains have some plasticity, just not as much as a child's. I'm including links below in sources concerning structural brain changes caused by trauma. I do want to point out that while the links below often mention PTSD, the people I have known with PTSD they weren't hardened. From what I personally understand, they can be extra sensitive to stress, and very emotional, BUT they can at times be distant and emotionally shut down, as well as a defense mechanism, but correct me someone if that's inaccurate, please. Anyway, I just included those because they show that trauma does affect the brain's actual structure.    I am also including a link about how physical damage to the brain can limit empathy.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	Your childhood does help in molding how you see things or have beliefs in certain things.   As far as being rude or always hard on people or your everyday outlook.. I would say No!  Some people are just having a bad day or week and there moody and quick tempered. I have seen guys at work be nice too a few and minutes later another worker come along and they are in a Arguement over something.    We all try too forget or push bad childhood exspierences back into our minds when we become adults. It does come out at times if an event triggers it or someone acts in away you remember from your childhood. I try too see the Good in other's and I would say the issue I fight with because of my childhood (Physical & Mental Abbuse) is : I don't TRUST a whole lot of people.. Trust is erned by someones action's as I get too know them.... I try too be approachable but I at times feel as if I have too protect myself too..|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	To be truly hard you would have to have had something happen to you.

PrarLmbxaa	It means that people who are too proud end up having clouded judgement, they make bad decisions and end up going down and losing all they had.  Being so proud made them fail.  What goes around comes around is known by everyone to refer to Karma and that what you do will come back to you, good or bad.  I guess their connection could be because someone who is so full of pride that they aren't being reasonable or think of themselves as higher than others tend to make poor calls and decisions.  These bad decisions come back to them and this is where the fall happens.  Take the movie/musical Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street as an example.

Many pride people do not have falls, many people do not get what we would consider they deserve, bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people and natural justice in this world does not exist.    There's some connection - if you are prideful, you might become lax, therefore more likely to make a mistake, leading to a fall. Or people start to dislike you and actively look for ways to take you down a peg or two. As for what goes around, comes around, very similar - people either seek to do you a bad turn or decide your bad luck is due to your own behavour.    One is about becoming arrogant, and the other is if you do bad, bad things will happen to you - they are not equivalent sayings. Most importantly, in the second the end result may be unconnected to the behavoir, whereas in the first it is expected that what has made you pridefall is what causes the fall.

AA12026843	there is a man in Ohio, that has an acupuncture clinic and he also goes to a church to thousands...and some of the testimonials would blow you away.  there are many many people that claim they have been healed by this man, and he takes no credit for it, he says, it is all GOD...  they have done interviews, but very few...i have seriously thought about going to Ohio to see if he can help me...or should i say GOD.  he says, you truly, truly, honestly...have to believe with all of your heart that there is a GOD and have no doubts.  i believe that the pope doesn't have the power because GOD is not very happy with the catholics...i think that the catholic church will be the first one to fall.  i have also been checking into quantum physics...very interesting what people are saying.  have you ever seen the movie, "The Secret"?  or how about Jose Silva...they claim that the human mind is very strong and you can heal yourself.  i would definitely like to go to one of their weekend programs that they have, they actually show you about healing, being psychic, and lots of other interesting things.  there is also a woman named Elizabeth Baron and she claims to go into some kind of mediatric trancelike state and she says that a Saint talks to her and gives her predictions...you should go to her website and watch the video and signup for her newsletters if your interested in this kind of stuff.  i'm not sure if your just asking for the hell of it or serious...but anyway, i would check it out.  also, "The American Monk"...who is Burt Goldman...very sweet man...and he sent me a drawing and told me what i had to do to heal myself, but i'm not strong like he is and i would really need to take some of Jose Silva's classes, it would make a big difference.  i will tell you that i tried the meditation like Burt said, and i stopped my pain.  i was blown away!  but if i keep going, i know i could probably do alot for myself.  as far as spiritually, Elizabeth Baron is the only one i know of who claims to talk to a saint...not have special powers or anything.  if you do a search of her name and go to her site, it will tell you more.  i do know what your talking about when you say people using there minds to bend spoons and other things as well.  are you just asking a question or searching for something in particular?    i think you truly have to have a strong belief and connection to GOD to really experience things as well.  me, and others have stories to tell people that they probably wouldn't believe.  because we have to go on faith to believe, it is hard for some people unless they see or touch it to believe it.|`|tALg7Hnuaa	because the power given to the pope/priests/pastors were only little. can you see the light that come from their hands when they do the benediction? if you can, then you're a psychic|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I suggest you look into Reiki, it is about being a chanel for divine energy so that the person who you are healing receives this energy. In the process the Reiki healer recieves healing. Priests, Monks, Nuns, the Pope all have the power to heal by their dedication an commitment to being servants of Jesus. Yet we all have the ability to heal through the power of prayer and love. Visualize your Angels placing healing hands on you every day, and try meditation to re-connect to your spirit. We all have energy auras, it is a scientific fact. Look into this and you can learn a great deal about human dynamics that how energy works.
Fq7FHQ44aa	i believe ur son is old enough to understand if u guys have fights or arguments, u need to talk to him and find out what's going on on his head. u and ur wife can be emotionally better off separately, and anywys u guys are living apart cuz of ur job (if i've understood u correctly).

You can keep living with the charade of a marriage for your sons sake, but in a couple years he'll be old enough to realize the marriage is a marriage in name only. Just divorce her now, get the alimony and child support going and move on with your life.|`|AA10988215	I think you need to discuss your feelings with your wife and ask her how she feels about your marriage and tell her how you've been feeling.  It may be that you both feel the same way and that an amicable divorce would ensue.  I think it's pointless trying to decide who is 'responsible' for the way you feel about each other at this stage-fact is if you're not happy and are distancing yourself from her (and thus your son) your son will notice and everyone ends up unhappy not knowing what the hell's going on.    My brother was in a similar situation to you except he made a huge mistake-having an affair.  He was in a loveless marriage (at least on his part) for 17 years, during which 3 children were born.  He embarked on an affair and subsequently left his wife and kids.  However, for a while, the children could not see that he left the family home because he was unhappy in the marriage, they simply saw it that he was choosing another women over them and it was awful for them at the time.    I think you need to tackle this head on and discuss with your wife what options you both have.  If divorce is the outcome then it's maybe for the best.  It will be hard for your son, but if you take time to talk to him about your decisions and make him feel included it may help him cope better.    Best wishes.|`|K2Wg3f9saa	The only thing I say is that you need to have a good stable, solid, meaningful relationship with your son. If that has broken down, rebuild it at great speed. This is your challenge, and this should consume all your concern in this situation.|`|eHUJOD0daa	Before you tell her you want a divorce, tell her how you feel and ask her, does she still want this marriage. If she says yes, then you should ask her how you both can make it work, make it better so that you wouldn't have any problems.  Your son might suffer a little if you do divorce but so that he wont feel as much pain if you have a talk with him about why. and you must let him know you will always be there for him and visit him when possible and take him places.|`|B1NuRCMRaa	Your setting an example for your kids of what a relationship should be, unfortunately its a negative example. I think it would be better to get divorced and have a mature friendship with your ex. I think your son suffers worse & later might feel to blame when he realizes that you stayed together unhappy for his sake.|`|9e1405bf185a865f8b87ab7c9380d12caa	I am very sorry to hear this. But as has been said. Make the hard decision. Divorce. It will hurt for a while, I know, I have been there and done as you have said. I hung around for years because of the kids. But I can honestly say that doing that destroyed me. I got that low, I felt like ending it all. But finally make my mind up and have not looked back since. Life goes on and you find children are stronger than you think. Just maintain your relationship with them and all will be fine. I wish you well and goodluck|`|vvlLXjOdaa	I can't particularly answer your question, but I can offer my opinion on one matter.  I'm now 23 and have lived my entire life with parents who have been very unhappily married. I know that while they'd struggle even more monetarily speaking if they were divorced...maybe...they'd probably both be much happier on an emotional level.    All in all, I believe that it'd probably have been easier on both my parents and myself if they were divorced long ago.  One of their reasons for staying together was because they had a child.  Maybe it's a nice thought to stay together for the kids, but it hurts the child just as much when they see their parents together and unhappy.  It hurts.  I can't express how much it has hurt, still hurts, and how much I've wanted to help them but couldn't.      So.  Unhappily together, happily apart, or doing all you can to find happiness again...really think about it from all sides and what all three of your are going through now.  I'd also recommend never assuming, but trying to get real answers.  Assumptions can have a tendency to go horribly wrong, especially when acted upon.   Good luck.
ab0969c637900508350d036d0578f045aa	Let's not get too immersed in the female VS male crap all over again. I'm sure many people have seen the swoon-plaqued females of the 60s/70s.     Nowadays, if they're not being a smart-***, they're being bimbotic queen bees. And in all honesty, I'd rather see smart-asses on TV than bimbotic teenage angst. They're healthier for the kids.    It's not a matter of feminism. It's a matter of producers, writers and actors/actresses failing to come up with the politically-correct portrayal of women and men.

Women are looked upon with higher esteem and seem to be the new heroes (super fighters like Sarah Connor, smarter leaders like "The Closer", more common sense like the lady on "Bones"etc.) while men are boobs ("According to Jim", "King of Queens", all the men that work under "The Closer" or the girl on "Bones").    I used to be bothered by it. But now I get it.  You are starting to see movies with women being clutzy idiots ("Heartbreak Kid" with Ben Stiller, "New In Town" with Renee Zellwegger). It's just not funny. Women don't play off the slapstick, "doh!"-like laugh like men do. I think Lucille Ball will probably be the only one.  In fact, I think it is rare to find women whom are actually funny as comediennes in any kind of genre. And I think I am in the majority; so the economics of Hollywood dictate that men should be the stupid fools.    And, as far as female heroes, I kind of like to see strong women muscling things around. As long as I'm not a weak,stupid boob myself I really shouldn't care at all, really.|`|W9nDtf3maa	Yeah...

ZOXoPgJbaa	Carnacki, you have some of it right my friend, but this has nothing to do with laissez-faire. If there was Laissez-faire we wouldnt have this problem.     There are a few reasons why we are in this mess.   I will try to not get into much detail because it would take forever for me to explain.      1 SEC allowed leveraging to go from 12/1 to 40/1 which means that you could lend out a dollar 40 times, creating a mountain of debt.   2 Credit default swaps allowed you to buy insurance contracts and not be forced to keep much of the money as reserves which helped blow the housing bubble.    3 the federal reserve kept interest rates artificially low which got people to mal-invest because the lending rates were just as low as the rate of inflation so it was almost like free money.   4 Alan Greenspan and Bill Clinton Created CRA which allowed banks to loan money to people who wanted to purchase homes, which had no business owning one. Our government guaranteed that if these people defaulted, that the taxpayer would pay for the defaults, hence the bailouts. In so many words if they won, they privatized the profits, when they lost, they socialized the losses.    5. Because of the change of lending standards, and artificially low interest rates, housing prices went on the rise, and investors realized this and either bought property themselves as speculative buyers, or started building new houses.    6. People that already owned homes started noticing their equities jumping through the roof, refinanced their loans, and started using their homes as ATM machines and started taking on much more debt than they should have thinking that prices would keep getting higher and higher.    7. When the people who were only allowed to lend through CRA started defaulting, all these speculative buyers turned into speculative sellers, and no one could get out of the door fast enough. Many foreclosed and banks started becoming insolvent, and didnt have cash. Because of so many foreclosures, speculative sellers, and new homes built, the supply of houses was much higher than demand, and so prices dropped, and are still dropping considerably.  Those people that had refinanced and spent all their equity money on material things are all now living in homes with negative equity.    8.This hit the commercial sector, and since many businesses rely on credit, they could not get that credit any more since many banks are either insolvent or afraid to loan because of bad economic conditions and so they defaulted as well.   9.  Because many homeowners have been hit with this negative equity, etc. There is much lower demand for goods other than necessities. Since companies have lower demand for goods, they start laying off people. This in turn lowers demand more because of less people who have disposable incomes, and more companies have to lay off more people. You can see where this could be headed.....    Now to address the stimulus package, it is horrible because we are only going to get a few hundred dollars, but the bill for the stimulus package is over $6700 for every man, woman, and child, and also many of the programs in it are wasteful spending.     If you are really interested in the economy and would like to know where we are going etc Check out:    http://www.mises.org  http://lewrockwell.com    EDIT: BARRACUDA, No one cheers bank bailouts, or stimulus packages. You want stimulus packages, cut income taxes by whatever amount these stimulus checks are going to be. Why have so much of it be pork? I dont agree with monetarists and trickle down economics completely, but it is much better than the garbage you call keynesianism. In the end the Austrian school trumps all other economic schools.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I'll make it this people:    1. People don't have jobs, most were outsourced or given to illegal immigrants, even some legal.  2. Too many predatory loans were given out which could not be paid back, hurting the banks.  3. The war in Iraq consumed too much money that could have been used here at home.  4. The economy just wasn't regulated.    The poor Republicans on here cheer the stimulus bills for the banks, but do not want the stimulus bill for regular people. They are nuts!    If you own a cheeseburger business, assuming each person in the country buys 1 cheeseburger a day if they can afford it, let's give you this scenario.    If only 10 people can afford a cheeseburger a day, you sell 10 cheeseburgers.    If 1,000 people are given enough money to buy a cheeseburger from your business, you sell sell 1,000 cheeseburgers.    That's why trickle-down economics is a failure, and a Republican lie. It does not help the economy or business.|`|X6WAOqZOaa	Corruption|`|NmIYrL1Paa	Because of people making too much children and people who wastes our natural resources.

That caused everything to increase in price because it takes oil to make a product.  It takes oil to deliver a product.  When they ran everyone out of money then we have a recession.  Now that oil prices have dropped back to where they should be, consumers don't have money to buy things.|`|8cXAf7lCaa	There is obviously much more than what I have here, but whatever:    Firstly, we have the housing bubble. People were getting crazy rates, not fixed either. So, people assumed they could afford something they could not. Then, those loan companies and banks sold these loans off as high-risk securities to bigger banks. Soon, people could not pay their rising bills. So, those banks with the now toxic securities are losing money. As a result, they won't lend any of their money to small businesses or consumers. Why? Because they don't trust anyone. So, with people in over their heads in mortgage debt and banks not lending money to business (which hire people and are integral to the economy), the financial system slows down. Add all this to laissez-faire administration and other factors and you have yourself a good ol' recession.     Just some thoughts from a high schooler... :P

956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	Ha, they use our techniques.  Archaeologists have a long, and very often sordid, history of digging up bodies.  Most of the human remains we find are little more than bones, while the forensic guys often get, uh, fresher remains.  But they use our excavation techniques.  For good reason; we're good at getting every last bit of data out of everything we dig, including from the soil surrounding the artifacts.    There are other overlaps, as well.  Osteologists are people who study human bones.  They've worked in archaeology in the past to identify remains as far as is possible, as well as to map data such as average age at death, common diseases (at least the ones that leave bone evidence), even wealth of the people.  Heavy manual labor and poor nutrition both leave marks on your bones.  Osteology is also a useful science for forensics, for identification (at least of the "woman, age 20-30" type) and any identifying marks, like an old broken arm.    You should check out William Maples' book.  He worked on cases such as identifying Nicholas II and his family's remains.
AA10181489	For starters the EMH is basically dead for a variety of reasons, however, with regard to 1 I don't think you quite understand the intent and I am certain a neural net would provide an incorrect outcome.  If I could fit integrals into Yahoo Answers I would provide you a reason that you should not be able to use any traditionally constructed net and get a solution that works one way or the other.  I am getting ready to work with a PhD mathematician whose discipline is neural networks and other non-deterministic systems to try and solve a somewhat similar problem.  However, it could be proved that you cannot use a neural network program to solve this type of problem.  The reason is too complicated for Yahoo Answers, but your reasoning is close.  If prices are fully informative then all other data outside their covariance matrix should result in white noise, given the ideas behind the hypothesis.  This can be falsified by the simple observation that for prices to be efficient because of evaluation of the underlying security then others could free-ride using their prices as informative.  As such, some people would participate in noisy pricing, except the Bayesian structure would grant arbitrage opportunities to the informed which would bias price and so they would not be fully informative.    As to two it is not proper to think as a zero sum game, nor in the two strategy game you are using.  If the EMH is valid as written then you have Brownian motion and so it pays nothing to be Buffet or a trader above rational expectations.  A price has a sample size of one, but it is still a valid Bayesian sample.  Bayesian statistics can work with a sample size of one, given prior information.  It is noisy, but you can do it.  As such, given the model beliefs, each price is always a valid expectation.    The model refers to present prices as discounted present values of future value given the covariance matrix, so future prices are implicit.|`|bibIAhN9aa	Who says trading is a zero sum game, if the market expands in the long run surely everyone is a winner in the long run.     You're example of Joe the Indian and Warren Buffet is confused, what time in particular are you talking about, there will be different results at different times. It's very hard to see what point your trying to make, or if indeed you really have one.     All information is in the price- efficiency fluctuates. It's only when people make mistakes that and there is inefficiency when you can make adnormal profits.     Insider information is not in the price. It is constatly possible to make adnormal profits with inside information.
nulE8zdBaa	Mozart, arguably the greatest composer of all time used to have many dreams which presented him with new compositions completely finished. On top of that he had a perfect musical memory so he could write the music down without sweat. Indeed, once he listened to Gregorian chanting at the Vatican. This piece of music had been kept secret for ages and it was to be kept secret for all times. The chanting lasted 3 hours. After it was finished Mozart went home and wrote it down in totality without mistakes.     The bio-chemist Kekule was unable to draw the chemical structure of the chemical molecule of the Benzene Ring. One day an afternoon nap fixed this forever. He dreamt how the elements coupled into a molecule. This formula now is the basis of 80% of bio-chemistry.    Elijah Howe wanted to build a sewing machine but it didn't work out. The needle which he fitted to his machine didn't do its job. He thought and thought and after months of mulling the problem over he dreamt that he was being chased by a mob of savages. He stumbled and the mob caught up with him. They said to him: "If you can't build us a sewing machine within 24 hours we will kill you with our spears." Then they threatened him with their spears. Howe woke up in a sweat. He went over this dream and suddenly he noticed that the spears of the natives had a hole in the spear-head. Eureka he shouted, went to his workshop and drilled the hole through his needle in the point instead of at the back as he had done before his dream. The sewing machine was invented!    An Indian mathematician used to pray to his personal Goddess to give him the solution to new maths problems. She did. British mathematician of his time said that he was way ahead of their mathematics.    When you realise that dreams are the real inventors and then ask yourself what kind of dreams Einstein must have had, you soon will get the idea that smart people have smarter dreams.|`|6JV8qToXaa	It depends on how many different things you've done in your life...

After all, how can you see this images in your dreams, if you never saw it in real life somewhere? I don't think dreams are ever meant to mean anything. So in essence there are no "smart" dreams, only dreams with possible inspiration and depth for psychoanalysis.    Since experiences are what define your dreams, it would be prudent to experience more from your normal day to day life. That way you can live life to the fullest in both worlds.     maybe I'm rambling but that's the best way i can put it at this moment.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	How is it possible to have 'smart dreams'?    Since you are basically unconscious, your brain is working off sensory information stored in the subconscious. Some of that is intellectual, but that is also what is stored in the subconscious. A person who doesn't read physics books isn't likely to have questions of dwarf stars popping up while they're running down the street, naked and late for class.    Smart people have the same stream-of-conscious type dreams as not-so-smart people. The only difference is that some smart people know why they dreamed what they did when they wake up.

It would be nice to believe what all the other people are saying, but it isn't an omen or anything supernatural.

You need to take her out for a romantic dinner really soon.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	It is possible that her dream is precognitive, but more likely that it is symbolic. Dreams that recur (or repeat themselves) is a clear indication that some issue is not being confronted or that it has not yet been resolved. Anxieties about a certain situation that one is struggling with may also cause one to have recurring dreams.     To dream that a plane crashes suggests that she has set overly high and unrealistic goals for herself.  Her goals may be too high and are impossible to realize, so she is in danger of having it come crashing down. Alternatively, she her lack of confidence, self-defeating attitude and self-doubt toward the goals she has set for herself is represented by the crashing airplane; she may not believe in her ability to attain those goals. Loss of power and uncertainty in achieving her goals are also signified.     Death in dreams signifies the end of a phase in one's life. Your gf may be anxious that is she were to achieve her goals, it would mean the end of part of her life that she is unwilling to lose.|`|0ba4c9ff30dbd5fcca6962160c91d3c2aa	Often when a significant other dies in a dream, it's symbolic of a fear of separation.

1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	Absoloutley not. Despte what another claims about it making the child respect women. It will make him hate women, particularly as it's his own mother advocating the violence as some sort of dry run for when she needs to defend herself. What man exactly is going to lie down and let a woman do this? She needs to realise he is going to grow up to be stronger than her and there will come a day where a swift kick to the nuts will result in nothing more than rage from the brother; the result will be a battered woman (be that the sister, a future wife, the mother or whomever). Not withstanding this, what does the mother think is going to happen when her daughter takes a disliking to a man, who has not been brought up to take a kick in the nuts, one day and hospitalises the poor guy - few women realise how dangerous it actually is but men have died as a result!   I cannot condone violence; violence only ever breeds more violence and this, so far as I am concerned, amounts to ritualistic child abuse which the authorities should be notified of. This woman does not deserve the right to call herslef a mother!!|`|3862H0WVaa	You are right to worry as this can cause cancer.    Has she the right to raise her daughter that way?  I think you'vee got to remember that siblings will fight.  But to go for such a delicate place on a young boy is strange behavior especially if it is being condoned by the mother.  Well the law doesn't protect males form female on male violence is seems to be treated as a joke. So unfortunately it would seem by LAW she does have the right and by feminist propaganda she feels she is morally correct to assault a younger weaker human being in this way.  I would be very very worried however, as the mother does not sound fit enough to bring up a male child.  The funny thing is when this boy reaches his teens he is going to be one angry young man and may take it out on random females that had nothing to do with this abuse.  So if the mother who seems to have a problem with men and boys thinks she is empowering her daughter by letting her behave in this manor is actually creating trouble for women.    I used to fight with my sisters as well but we never went anywhere near each others private parts, this is very strange and deviant behavior,|`|wRPuGTHMaa	I completely agree with the people saying that it's wrong.  I never did that to my younger brother when we were young.  It's not a natural thing.  There is no such thing as an 8 or 9 year old feminist.  Feminists don't believe in kicking a boy in the groin.  There's a difference in a mother telling their teenage daughter self-defense.  She's a terrible mother.  That little girl will definitely grow up and commit deviant, if not criminal behavior.  I'm appalled!|`|EGlFhHR2aa	What's the big deal? Every girl has kicked a boy in the nuts! It's part of growing up, and is probably the best way for boys to learn to respect girls.  So long as she doesn't actually crush his nuts, I see nothing wrong with her mother encouraging your daughter's friend to do it. Also your daughter will learn a lot of empowerment by doing the same thing.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	I'm sure there are plenty of websites that cater to people with your fetish.

Be a little smarter and figure out another angle.|`|uhchod38aa	People may have trouble accepting this a serious question because it sounds outrageous. No, that mother is wrong. It's never okay to teach children that they can hurt others if they are mad at them. Why is her mother teaching her that it's okay to kick her little brother in his privates?

It's pretty sick, though.|`|P7pZo7Ztaa	I think that you should talk to the mother about it, it could be your daughters friend making up stories or your daughter getting the wrong idea of a story. Just make sure that your daughter knows that it is wrong and maybe stop her from spending time with her friend away from you or another responsible person.|`|pHcz0gVoaa	You just asked her why she did that? You should have slapped her so that she won't repeat it again. Hope your son doesn't do the same thing to her sister.

Since yours started peeling and then fell off, it may mean that you were just feeling tired and not so virilent as usual.

Something in your life makes you feel powerless.  Could be that job, or a relationship, or finances, etc.  I would think that it wasn't a relationship because of the lack of blood.  The whole thing seems kind of like "whoops.  There goes my penis" so it doesn't seem like any sort of major emotional deal except for the pain.  So I would say that it's not from something very personal like your girlfriend or a parent.    Best of luck dealing with it all.  Oh yeah, Dude, I'm sending you some superglue.
q2SzkuaXaa	1. The CPI.    2. Gordon Brown favours it because it's usually lower than RPI, making it look as if inflation is lower. Also it's easier to fiddle, see below.    3. RPI. Mortgage rates were removed because of the following effect. Suppose inflation goes up for some reason (e.g. rising oil prices), so the Bank raises interest rates to try and control it. This means that mortage interest rates rise, adding to the RPI and making inflation look worse! This is because inflation actually *is* worse: people are paying more for their housing than they were before! But the government would rather ignore this, as it makes them look as if they've lost control of inflation (which they have).|`|bibIAhN9aa	1) I think its the consumer price index CPI  2) It measures the price of a basket of standard goods and compares the price year on year.   3) Not too sure, but I think mortgage interest rates were removed b/c they made the inflation rate look higher, so the government could claim inflation was lower.

Psychology may be the best career to have right now as people lose their jobs and companies trying to make comebacks and they need psychological analysis or guidance for themselves and sometimes consumers. I heard that a lot of graphic designers are losing their jobs right now alongside with architects. But I am sure the career will bounce back in the near future.    However if you're into art and you like to express yourself and have a thing for design and drawing you may want to join graphic design. Because believe me if you have an artistic soul and you don't follow its needs your going to regret it for the rest of your life.    And last but not least you have to think how you're going to promote yourself after graduation. If you already have friends or relatives in the same fields who can push you in the right direction or at least assist you in the right ways.    Hope I helped.|`|AA11809403	you can start by taking classes in BOTH, and seeing what you like.  Also, there is a psychological test you can take at college, called the Strong-Campbell Occupational Interest ( Aptitude test, i think)    that will give you some useful info.    You CAN pick one major, and change majors later. Really.|`|Yj33dIoJaa	There is no should    Psychology is a learning course. You don't get many hands on unless its part of the curriculum. And you will be hard pressed to find many hands on stuff except in yahoo answers. It is a remember what you learn course. And you get exams and the like.     Graphic design is more hands on. But you actually have to be able to draw. And a lot of practise is needed. It is something you cannot merely learn and remember. I do not think there are many exams. So they test you on your works for the whole year.|`|SdKYHk6zaa	Well theres no real easy answer, but I will perhaps say that Psychology is perhaps the safest option (I do it). Unlike Graphic design, it's relatively safe for recession. How I would have loved to have an art degree myself, but it's about the future. In the UK anyway there are far too many graphic designers, my housemate did illustration for uni and he didn't go on to have an illustration job because there was none!    if you don't care about the recession, thats good for you, follow your heart (who gives a **** about material wealth right?) some people have different priorities. I just think Psychology will be very rewarding if you stick it through
YCA6JBvbaa	Unfortunately you already know what the dream means.  It means that you are afraid sis-in-law will ruin your relationship (in whatever capacity) with this fellow.    The only way you can stop dreaming like this is to quit focusing on this guy like he's a modern greek god.  He's flesh and bone and he's a guy.  He laughs at stupid stuff.  He stares at pretty girls.  He has burping contests with his friends.  He's a human being and he's approachable.  Don't place him in such an important place in your heart if you barely talk to him.  Enjoy being yourself and you will see that guys notice girls who are self confident and don't need someone to fall all over them.  Trust me, you don't want the guys that do.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Lovey, this is just your insecurity getting the better of you.     Here's the thing - people who are pretty when young, as in under 30, rarely age well ..... and after 30 it takes a lot of work and commitment to stay looking as good as you did in your 20s, and not many have the time for this, what with kids, jobs, etc. Basically your sister-in-law will not always be so stunning, nor with your crush remain the dish he is today. You, on the other hand, might grow into your own particularl kind of beauty and attractiveness, it's very common, and is the basis for the ugly duckling that grows into a beautiful swan.     If your sister-in-law is so striking, of course men are going to look at her - and there is nothing wrong with looking. Rather than being jealous, I think you need to consider other things: has she more to her than her looks? Because looks are NOT everything .....     And as for your crush hating you in the dream .... again, this is your imagination running away with you. How can he hate you if in reality he doesn't know you? He might just be indifferent to you, which is nothing like hate - hate is such a strong word! No, this is your insecurity about how your sister-in-law looks, and how you compare to her looks-wise. There is probably much more to you than you realise, but you can't get past the fact that she is so striking.     Get yourself a piece of paper and make a list of your good points. You have good things about you too, that maybe the sister-in-law doesn't have. Be proud of what you do have.|`|DJThkWRTaa	Your dreams can often be driven by your self conscious the fact that you are dreaming this does not mean that it will happen it means that you fear it happening self consciously!|`|YvSd553Jaa	you can't stop it.    try just aasking him about it, you never know    boy your sis must be HOT :]|`|edeXyM4laa	well for one, you can have a crush on him, but what else besides his looks is interesting or appealing about him, and for another thing, dreams aren't always accurate they can be just plain retarded sometimes, don't feel bad about what you dreamed, your mind gets board when you are asleep and tries to string things together to entertain itself, like you ate a certain cereal yesterday, and you saw your sister dancing, your mind might make a dream where your sister is a dancing cereal box, get it?  don't feel ashamed, actually laugh about it. =)    and don't worry, he isn't the only guy that could be good for you, try expressing to him your feelings, in any way you want, but if it doesn't work out, well, your school isn't the only place where cute guys are. =)    hope this helped.|`|8p77P2rNaa	There's nothing bad or disturbing about this dream.

You will be tested to determine if your attitudes, outlook and thought processing fall within the normative range.    Don't try to fudge your answers in order to make yourself seem to be someone you aren't.  Instead, be honest and forthright.  Your true perceptions and attitudes will tend to allow you to fall within acceptable boundaries if you have tested well in your home country.

The banks can borrow in the overnight   funds market (fed funds rate) at zero percent and are paying depositors almost nothing. Since banks make their money on the interest rate spread, loaning money   is very profitable right now. When economists want a measure of the risk in the economy they look at these interest rates spreads and they currently indicate that the banks think the risk is high for defaults which is why they are reluctant to lend. You can still get a home mortgage at a  low rate but you must have a down payment of 20%.    Edit: The fed only determines the fed funds rate, all other rates are determined by market forces of supply and demand.  That means if the rates for loans were higher fewer  businesses would want to borrow.|`|AA10719402	High interest rates contract the money supply which is a big nono during a recession or slow down.      Yes, it would give them more incentive, but it would also give he borrowers less incentive.    When Fed interest rates are higher, that means the bank has to borrow at a higher rate as well.  For your theory to work, banks should have to borrow low and lend high.|`|3WAoZclbaa	The banks are not lending because of high or low interest rates...at this current market ANYONE that is some sort of LENDER is pulling back from lending because its a high risk.

Well....the "trigger" is a humorous heart & soul...As a matter of fact, laughter is the "best medicine"..."inner jogging" and is the healthiest "function" of our body, which should be "practices" as often as possible, because it promotes your "all-around-HEALTH" !!    The reason may be of "numerous kinds" (among them could be "sarcasm" as you've mentioned), but what ever the "cause" may be, it's "strongly" recommended to laugh as much as possible in "today's world", where there's NOT "too much" to laugh about (when you listen to the disastrous news on TV...such as the "moran", who extinguished his WHOLE family in CA).....The sick people we have "among us" are numerous, so please take ANY opportunity to laugh in your life, my dear !    In closing I would like to present you something, which you (as a creative musician) can relate to :    I was irrevocably betrothed to laughter, the sound of which has always seemed to me to be the most civilized music in the world.

Right now to be honest i took off my shirt and my pants and i am sitting on them next to a huge pile of clothes that a full laundry should clean. But if you want to be rude to me just becaause of that i would think its fair. Your sister should treat you better no arguing there she has to change her attitude, mabye if you treat her more like a friend than a sister, try going out to the mall with her or talk to her about her bf and stuff like that. Your sister is getting mood swings and i am pretty sure she doesnt feel happy about them, so my suggestion is to go and talk to her and hopefully you can get things well sorted out with you and her.  Best of luck   Tc|`|43eUq8hOaa	for starters,i would get a lock on my bdrm door!

Others might not agree,but it is the only advice i know to give.Good luck no matter what you decide to do-you sound like a very sweet girl and I hope you get this resolved.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	You sound very sensible! And maybe just a little uptight?  Go about your business, keep your room clean and tidy and help out around the house because IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO .... don't worry about what she is up to ... it's really none of your business what she is like.  I don't mean that in a rude way, but we can't control how others are, you can only be how you are.  Get yourself off to the beach ... how hot is it! (are you Aussie?). xx|`|nQOaKiueaa	I think she is the one who acts like a 16 year old.  You should simply talk to her, if you already did, and I know you have, just talk to her more.  And try someone else to help you other than your mom to talk to her.  It's hard being the little sister as she will always treat you as the younger one and how she is always right and how wrong you are and how she can do whatever she wants as she's older than you.  Just be patient and one day when you girls are older she will realize all this and treat you better.
gW0nD5cEaa	In the northern hemisphere, especially the American midwest right now, getting out of the shower in a heated house was not a pleasant thing for a couple of seconds.    Forget any religious or other moral questions, which are big in themselves. How do you think the fashion industry would react to nudity being the thing to do? I mean they would come up with body paints, some kinds of things to decorate our bodies, but total nudity? It would never work with marketing. They would come up with something to put on us.    Modesty in most cultures is tied into religious beliefs to begin with, but even atheists are not usually nudists, at least in public. Yes, we probably are the only animals to feel a need to cover ourselves, but then again, we have much less 'fur' than most animals. Creationists tie it into Adam and Eve, after they sinned they realized they were naked and were ashamed.    I don't know what people who strictly believe in evolution think, whether it was because of weather, some early humans lived during ice ages, or some were early fashion statements, I mean, somebody somewhere, probably a female picked up a piece of animal fur after cooking some meat, and put in over her shoulders or something. Then the female in the next cave just had to get a fur for herself. Or maybe it was modesty, when people began to notice differences in the bodies of one another, or women were trying to keep unwanted attention from themselves if they were not interested in a male;  or maybe it was males first, trying to protect certain regions of the body from injury.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Evolution isn't about "perfection" at all. No, we aren't always evolving into an ideal form. You've misunderstood evolution.    OUR evolution included our ginormous brains, and manual dexterity, to be able to make clothes -- which enable us to live in every climate. Naked, we couldn't survive, or (some places) be uncomfortable and unhappy.    We evolved in a warm climate; we've since moved all over, including places we really need clothes.    Clothes are also a cultural thing.|`|57af3cd106168b01009e4dbbc6d55acbaa	- Modesty  - Religion ... human nature ... sin  - Culture ... traditions ... customs  - Environment and nature  - Fashion|`|QXQWDw1qaa	It's a PUBLIC SERVICE.. because once you are past THIRTY YEARS OF AGE... it's just too SCARY to see you naked.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	It's really for necessity. Our ancesters originated on the African plains where it was very arid and hot. So as we evolved, unlike other animals, we could take care of our body temperatures with animal skins or by building fires. When we mirigrated to cooler climates we had to wear skins to stay warm. After some time we learned to make clothes from spun and woven materials that were more comfortable and warmer. There are other animals which don't have much hair too. Such as hogs. Now we have had the habit of wearing cloths so long that we use them as protection from the elements and as a fashion statement like a Rooster's comb or a Pecock's tail. And sometimes we just want to look plain and blend in with the crowd.|`|TKNPveHDaa	It's not hiding imperfections, it's ornamentation, wearing really fun or pretty blouses.  It's style and fashion.

According to evolution, our bodies grew weaker.  We would have lost our natural defenses. Claws, fangs, more muscular limbs.  We lost our warmth. Weather appropriate fur or hair over our body has been phased out.    We have to wear clothes because we've lost our natural means for shielding the body from the elements.    Our form is far from perfected. It's only current.   Who knows how we'll look in another few million years?

bGlZ8I2iaa	Being American is a cultural designation. The American culture is a very diverse culture influenced by all of the various cultures involved and homogenized over the years. (Interestingly, the English were resistant to assimilation when compared to say, the Scotch-Irish or German immigrants.) While I can trace one branch of my family tree to Scotland born 1603 and coming to America in 1640 and another branch back to the early Germanic tribes of Middle Europe, most of my ancestors for the past 300+ years were American born, that makes me pretty much of American ancestry.|`|wRPuGTHMaa	People from America are already American.  People who are of English decent are from England.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	I think the real Ancestry of America is the American native Indians.. Those are the True people that was here when the Spanish discovered the country.   American Ancestry is more/less grouped into cultures of mixed race and other countries! Many English started the settlements and banded together into colony's. You are rite that our ancestry is mixed with all sorts of people and cultures handed down from the generations...|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Native Americans were here first, and even they apparently at some time had come from Asia. Most people use some term for their background, a lot of times pulling out one of many because more of their ancestors came from one country (Ireland, for example), or they have a last name from one country (Ireland, Italy, etc.) even if they have other ancestry as well. Many people are identified by their last name.    Some cultures, especially Asians often put a great deal of importance in their ancestors, some worship them, some do not. African Americans only fairly recently been able to trace families back before the end of slavery, sometimes to Africa. That became popular after the book and Miniseries "Roots" in the 1970's.     I'm not sure what you mean by "Isn't English already American" , an American of British ancestry is American, but an English person is not American unless they become citizens.     Some people make a lot of their ancestors, others do not and don't like it when people use the terms.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	No, the English came from England.    I assume they're referring to Native Americans -- people who were here before Europeans came along and spoiled all their fun.|`|AA12343309	People often confused nationality with race, ethnicity or ancestral heritage.  What you saw probably came from statistics off of census records.    Nationality is only the country of which you are a citizen.  Now some people can have dual citizenship.  It is not your race, ethnicity or ancestral heritage.  It not the country from which your ancestors immigrated.      Some dictionaries define nationality as where you are born but that gets murky.  If you are born in the U.S., you are an American citizen. This isn't true of all countries.  In some countries if you are born to foreign national parents that does not automatically make you a citizen.    I am a Pedigree American Mutt.  When I was asked that question by the census taker I just went blank.  He said, "American?" and I said, "yes."   It has been stated that most people in the South gave the answer, American.  Those of English descent in the North were more inclined to say English.  I think some of the New England Yankee families have had more of a tendency to stay within their own.    The English in the South in early colonial days usually came from titled families and they were mostly on the Eastern seaboard of the Southern states.   The Scots, Scotch Irish, people from one of the German states were more rugged and went inland, cleared the land and made it habitable and then the English moved westward.   French Huguenots came in and were frequently good cotton agents for the English planter who all too often didn't want to be bothered with business.  But as time went by all of these people have pretty much blended. Even though Anglo Saxon specifically means English, the so called Anglo Saxon people of the South are really a mix of all these people.  So asking them their ancestry, they will give you their nationality, American.  Because of the blend, many probably don't' know  their exact ancestry.  Probably descendants of later immigrants to our country know more about where their ancestors came from than those of colonial heritage.|`|bU1ASYw7aa	You cant really have an American Ancestry.  America is made up of tons of different ethnic groups like you pointed out.  So in truth, anyone who has family that has lived in America could say they have an american ancestry.  The English weren't the only ones to found this country, so it would be wrong to say that you could only have an American ancestry if you were English.|`|tc3Burhqaa	Native Tribes and Nations are the only Americans, from my prospective,  that can be defined as such.

6GmtcZteaa	Typical Career Options  The majority of students graduating with a bachelor's degree will work in some division of human or social services. Some common job titles in the area include:    ?Case Management   ?Career Counselor   ?Rehabilitation Specialist   ?Psychiatric Technician    Some important skills for those working in this area include the ability to assess client needs, keep thorough and accurate records, express care and empathy, and to act as an advocate for your client.     In addition to social services, a bachelor's in psychology can provide excellent training for many other types of jobs. One of the most important things you have learned during you undergraduate years are interpersonal skills. Your understanding of the human mind and behavior make you a good candidate for jobs that require good communication skills. Some examples jobs in this area include those in sales, marketing, case management, and government welfare protection agencies.     As an undergraduate, you have also done a considerable amount of research and writing. This skill would be useful in many jobs, such as a library assistant, probation officer, business manager, case worker, and many others.     When searching for your first post-graduation job, be sure to consider all of the skills you have acquired during your time as a student. Make a list of things you learned in various classes to help you assess your skills and talents in order to find a job best suited to your educational background and professional goals.|`|43eUq8hOaa	you can get a job w/a BA,but you might as well just get a job as a secretary.Most descent jobs in the field require a master's or PhD.And the money is definitely better.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	You can do lots with a BA.

(Ever heard the adage "history is written by the victor?" The archaeological record only has facts, not opinions).  It's great that you like to read, because any sort of anthropologist needs to keep up with journal articles so they know what research is going on around the world.      It is also great that you like travel, are comfortable in different situations, and are good at negotiating.  This would come in handy when working on archaeological sites in different locations with new and diverse groups of people.  Athletic ability also helps because digging is hard work! Your photographic memory will come in handy for identifying artifacts you have seen before.    Are you good with science?  If so, you might be interested in bioarchaeology (archaeology of human remains) or zooarchaeology (archaeology of animal remains).      Math is not used constantly in archaeology, but you will need to be able to understand and use statistical analysis.  I find this easier and more interesting than something like calculus because if can be directly applied to my work, and is not abstract.  This has helped me get through.      I like that you admitted your attractiveness could be a weakness.  It shows that you think about things.  In the past, anthropology has had a bit of bad reputation for older male figures of authority taking advantage of attractive young female students.  However, this is changing.  One way to avoid it if the possibility makes you really uncomfortable is to find a female supervisor.      I suggest you try out archaeology (or any other subfield of anthropology you might be interested in) at a field school to see if you are really passionate about it and then go from there. It sounds like you are a very talented person and will succeed at whatever you do.  Good luck!

cd3319aa34038dd846c41f15673ec460aa	Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and founder of the school of analytical psychology. He proposed and developed the concepts of the extroverted and introverted personality, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. The issues that he dealt with arose from his personal experiences. For many years Jung felt as if he had two separate personalities. One introverted and other extroverted. This interplay resulted in his study of integration and wholeness. His work has been influential not only in psychology, but in religion and literature as well.     Jung believed that symbol creation was a key in understanding human nature. Symbol, as defined by Jung, is the best possible expression for something essentially unknown. He wanted to investigate the similarity of symbols that are located in different religious, mythological, and magical systems which occur in many cultures and time periods. To account for these similar symbols occurring across different cultures and time periods he suggested the existence of two layers of the unconscious psyche. The first of the two layers was the personal unconscious. It contains what the individual has acquired in his or her life, but has been forgotten or repressed. The second layer is the collective unconscious which contains the memory traces common to all humankind. These experiences form archetypes. These are innate predispositions to experience and symbolize certain situations in a distinct way. There are many archetypes such as having parents, finding a mate, having children, and confronting death. Very complex archetypes are found in all mythological and religious systems. Near the end of his life Jung added that the deepest layers of the unconscious function independently of the laws of space, time and causality. This is what gives rise to paranormal phenomena. The introvert and the extrovert are the main components of personality according to Jung. The introvert is quiet, withdrawn and interested in ideas rather than people. While the extrovert is outgoing and socially oriented. For Jung a person that had a healthy personality can realize these opposite tendencies within himself/herself and can express each. Dreams serve to compensate for any neglected parts of the personality.|`|43eUq8hOaa	Carl Gustav Jung(1875-1961)developed Analytical Psychology.He was an associate to Sigmund Freud(1856-1939)and Alfred Adler(1870-1937).All were psychiatrists who specialized in psychoanalysis.Hope that helps-I am a Psychology major.Good Luck and if I can answer anymore,let me know!!!!|`|AA11648899	Google.com.|`|afFUs27kaa	he was basically an extension on Freuds theories but added a bit of his own wording to it all and gave a few more ideas...not one of my favourite philosophers. but yeah look him up for more detailed answers.
nQOaKiueaa	This is normal.  Most people tend to ask for help from their loved ones on what to do, whether they should take a shower or not and I am dead serious.  I know some people who can't decide for themselves on what to do.  Sometimes on whether to send an email or not.  It gets frustrating as these are adults but I think everyone goes through that phase once in a while.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	The problem is your fear of making the wrong choice.  If you truly believe that there is no such thing as a 'wrong' decision you are free to choose without second guessing yourself the whole time.  Trust your instincts.|`|3WAoZclbaa	dont worry im the same way..i annoy everyone around me because i change my mind 15 million times until I get sick of changing my decision.
43eUq8hOaa	i don't believe that anyone has a functional upbringing-thats for television.Or maybe i have just never known someone who did.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	I'm guessing the term disfunctional came first (as in not 'normal') and now we've provided the opposite, functional.  Functional, normal, hmmm hard to define these days.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	:"Functional upbringing" can mean, a good upbringing, good parents, little disruption in their lives versus a "dysfunctional upbringing" with parents who are (for example) alcoholics, father beats kids, parents always fighting...etc..etc...
