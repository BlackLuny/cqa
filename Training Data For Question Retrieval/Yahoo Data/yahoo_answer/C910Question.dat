20090307150138AAB51gN	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Injured spouse tax help?	Ok this is the deal. I and my wife filed under injured spose yesterday because I owe the IRS back taxes of $ 6000 I owed this before we got married in 2007 I worked for 6 months in 2008 and made aboout $19000 my wife only made $3000. The IRS didn't take out no Federal for the year because of living situations I live in Las Vegas so no state taxes. I didn't file last year but my wife only got back $50 and a $300 stimulas check. Ok we went and E filed yesterday jointly under injured spouse and we claimed our child that was born in January 08. We qualified for EIC and was told we're going to get $4500 back in a few weeks deposited into my wifes checking account. The question is how much do you think we will get? Is there a certain percentage because I know the IRS is going to keep alot because I owe from 3 years ago my wife doesn't owe anything but my wife only made $3000 last year. And how long does it take for the IRS to deposit the money into the account. I asked the tax preparer but he didn't know because he said he doesn't have that much experience in filing under injured spouse. So please can somebody help me because we would really like to no at least a estimate of how much we are getting because I keep getting different guesses from people I know. Thanks for your help

I left college after completing a Legal Secretaries Course. I am finding it so hard to find work because I only have a small amount of work experience, which I gained through 2 week placement.       There is a solicitors that offered me ￡4.77 an hour, so 40 hours a week that's, ￡190 a week.      It seems that that college was a waste as I can get payed more in a chippy, care home or shop. I know I haven't got any experience but is that a fair amount to be paid?
20090307150906AAKQR3J	Business & Finance;Credit	A debt collector is claiming that deleting the record in exchange for payment in full is against HIPAA?	My fiance's credit report shows a collection held by Senex Services for a medical debt.  He called, did not own to the debt, since he really didn't know what it was.  They said it was for a hospital visit in 2002.  He offered to pay Senex Services the full amount of the debt in exchange of deletion of record with credit agencies.  They told him that they cannot do that because it is a violation of HIPAA guidelines.  Can someone help me find a link proving that they are incorrect?  It is my understanding that a creditor or collection agency may delete information at their own discretion up to 7 years, at which point the debt (other than judgements, etc.) is removed by credit agencies.

20090307151647AAA6YHx	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is it a good idea to buy a cheap home and then rent it out to make some extra income?	The house would be under $60,000.  It would be in the general vicinity of my actual house.  I would do some repairs or updates to the house before renting it out.  The legal stuff, contracts leases etc, can be dealt with easily for me.  I would probably hire someone to either fully manage the property or get a handyman for the tenant to call in an emergency.  The most important question I have is because of the market sucking now is smart to try to rent out a house.  The upfront costs will be high, but I feel that if I price the rent right and find a tenant then I can make enough money.  Won't people want to not get into a home mortgage but a simple renting agreement for a few years.  I would buy and rent out in CT if you have any more specifics.  Please include your experiences and any good places to research the subject.   Thanks

Ok please notice that I wrote "for me" and that I let you know a little about me. I am 32 years old, and have a mental disorder, have not worked in close to 6 years, but before that I had many jobs lots of work experience (food service, warehouse, and retail) strong work ethic got raises and then got fired for not showing up to work or just plum falling asleep through my shift.

20090307152047AAi87Ik	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Passed credit check for an apartment, but owner decided not to give it to me anyway?	My fiance and I looked at an apartment in Chicago and had a verbal agreement with the owner that we were interested.  She (the owner) said we were the kind of tenants she wanted, and gave the 3rd party apartment broker the greenlight to run our credit at a total cost of $90 out of our pocket.  Then, after our credit passed with flying colors, she decided to give the place to someone else who agreed to rent it for a 3 year lease instead of the 1 year she had originally been fine with.  Had she told us that she was going to offer it to another tenant over what were apparently STILL negotiable terms, we'd never have paid the money for the credit check.  Now we are out $90, our credit score may be temporarily dinged (credit checks are not something you want hitting you more than once in a blue moon), and for what?  An apartment we had no chance of getting to begin with because the owner changed her mind?  Is this legal?      To me the decision to run our credit was an agreement to give us the place unless we failed the credit check or WE changed our minds.  I feel she owes us $90.  Can we do anything other than write her a letter and report her to the local renter's organization?

It's like a torture, both physically and mentally. I look at the clock every 5 minutes (it would be 5 seconds, but I do a special effort not to look so often) and my whole body hurts.      I guess this is a simple matter of laziness, but it's worrying me. What will I do when my parents die? I'd rather die than living like that... Plus one job is not enough anymore, so I'd have to work the whole day just to be able to meet my basic physiological needs.      Please do not laugh at my misery.      PS: I'm not a citizen so I can't find a random illness and live off the government, and I can't become one so this is definitely not an option.

At about 12:30 we get a drive off order, one where the customer pays and forgets to pick up her food. She was the only car in the drive-thru so it wasn't like it was busy, either. We kept her order for about 5 minutes before it got cold and tossed it assuming she wouldn't return.   Anyways, about an hour later she comes back, mad as a hornet. She promptly pulls ahead to the second window and tears the person handing out the food a new one. He leaves the lady to my coworker, another manager who loves to deal with difficult people. The customer is also black, it is some what important, and the manager is is Hispanic.   Customer (yelling): Wheres my food?   manager: We're making you're order again, it will be up in only a little bit. (He says this in a really kind, polite tone)   Customer: I drive off, you should have the food here already! Wheres my water.   Manager: The machine is pouring your water right now, I'm sorry but its a bit slow.   Customer: Don't be rude! I want my water RIGHT NOW and my food!   Manager: Your water and food will be ready in a bit.   Customer: NO! you should have my food and I want it hot too!   Manager: We are making your food as fast as possible. It will be ready in a moment.   Customer: You should have my food now! Why don't you have my food?!   Manager (still being polite and calm): It is being made right now.    Customer (wags index finger): You would be more polite if you were a white man! Next time I want white man at this window!   Manager: *cheerful tone* Here's your order. Have a wonderful day.   Customer (screaming at this point): Don't be rude!!!!      The lady was insane and rude. How would you handle this customer?

I work at a dog race track , as a teller(ticket Seller).     This year i have had a bad bad string of losing.     It's not helping that my schedule has me working there 6 days a week(no sunday), thus i have the urge more to gamble on dogs or horse tracks i never would before.     I asked my manager , that for the month of march , let me have monday and tuesday off, at least it will give me a break from the place.        I have over 200 hours of personal time, and i wanted to use 16 hours(10 on monday, 6 on tuesdays) for the month, a total of 64 hours.     He was kind of understanding, but still i did not get what i want.     He has offered me just tuesdays off( 6 hours) per week, but he gave me them off until sometime from now until the end of may     I am really not concerned right now, about april or may, as far as finances go. He told me to try to stop the gambling(don't bring your atm card, crap like that.     I am still gambling, since this meeting, nothing can probably change that, unless i am just NOT THERE.     I am seriously thinking about just saying good bye, and quit.     For one, i would like to know, if i would get any or all of my unused PTO time?.     Other think, most important, is in the time i am looking for another job, would i be declined for unemployment benefits.?     I mean they say gambling is a sickness, or a disease, whatever.      Just think i have a strong case, and would not be criticized if i quit this gambling environment.

The downside is I would need money for supplies/the full kit and I am currently roughly $8000 in debt. (Like I said...overseas move.)      Is there any way this could work for me? Am I reaching too high? If I need a small business loan...can I live on that money as well while my business is starting up?       All help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you SO much.

20090307120503AAIiTse	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I be honest about why I left my last job?	I left my last job because I needed to start therapy and my employer would not work with me on a schedule change. I didn't tell him that I needed to start therapy and don't feel as though I should have. I did however tell him that I was experiencing a serious personal problem but he didn't seem concerned at all. A few weeks after that I quit with the reason that I needed to focus more on schoolwork. 4 months later I was offered a job at an ice cream shop (a step down, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support my family in these times) and I'm worried about what I should say about why I left my last job. If I tell her that I needed to focus more on school, I don't want to give her the impression that it will happen again. Especially since she has already told me she's had several people quit after she paid for training. How should I handle this professionally?
20090307110047AACK1kN	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	?I would like to help my friend, she's unemployed and living in a shelter, what can I do?	I'm in high school and she is too but she's around 19 going on 20 years old. Her parents kicked her out of the house & she doesn't have any stable relatives to live with. She's barely graduating and she doesn't plan to go to college. I hadn't had a conversation with her in awhile but, I went to our high school's SADD meeting and she was there and afterwords my mom drove her up to the mall to get her cell phone fixed and she told us what has been going on with herself. My mom would offer her to stay with us but, that's a temporary fix and won't help her out of the path she's going down. We're in Ohio and she's in a shelter in Cleveland and she has to take 3 buses to get to our school. Is there a way we can try to find housing for her closer? And what programs are there that can help her out? Is there anything we can do to try to get her a stable job? She's not in any vocational programs at our school either. Please feel free to ask questions. And thank you for any help you can offer.

At the moment I have a Solo debit card, and get paid regularly into my account. I don't like carrying cash around, so I use my card for as many transactions as possible - even if for under ￡1.00 as it is more convenient as there is not a cash machine near to where I live and I do not see the point in withdrawing ￡10 when I only need to spend a few pounds as I will just end up spending the change. NatWest keeps blocking my card and not warning me, so I get declined - which happened again to me today. I went to the bank and they told me it is because there is too much activity on my account, even though there are the funds available and I never go overdrawn. Has this happened to anyone else, if it happens again I may change my bank - do any other banks do this? I now have to wait up to 7 days for a new card as everytime they block my account they cancel the card.

Children of low income families to get health insurance. This is called welfare. The program is already in place and has been for decades. My mom was on welfare when I was young. We used "medical coupons" for free health care. I'm 33 now, and this was when I was under 18. So what is the tobacco increase for again?? A program that already exists?? They are going to kill an entire industry. I mean, I thought America liked tax revenue. Don't they want more money since they gave hundreds of BILLIONS of YOUR tax dollars to bail out a handful of companies?!  This seems like simple economics to me. Lower prices mean more units moving, which means more tax revenue. Instead, more people will quit, then what will get taxed through the roof for this children's insurance? Your morning espresso? All forms of caffeine? What's your opinion?

20090307145555AA1IN9H	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Taxes on an early pension payout...?	I took an early pension payout when I left my job after 11 years.  Instead of reinvesting the money I used it to pay off all my bills except my vehicle, i.e. credit cards, late doctor/hospital bills, etc.  I paid state and federal taxes on the money before it was ever given to me, and I paid a penalty for early withdrawal.  On my taxes the next year, the sum I was actually paid was added to my taxable income, throwing me into a higher tax bracket as a single person and now I owe the IRS big time.  I am confused as to how this is not taxing the same money twice. I added up the total tax on the pension money and if correct my portion of that money that I worked for would have ended up being $1,500.00 (the pension was only $23,600.00 and I ended up with a little over $16,000.00 when they took the first set of taxes out).  I had a certified account do my taxes for me but I think there must be a mistake somewhere.  Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

I 'm an one of Wamu customers but I have to respond for banker's fault. So Sad !!!!!!!!        I wrote my checking account number on the deposit paper but the  girl who is the banker put money in the saving account.    She was talking with the guy next her when she made the deposit for me. She deposited my money into my saving account.  I did not check it because I told her deposit for checking.      Then, I understood I had money in my checking account.  I used my debit card for $41.24 , $3.41 and $27. When I came back to home I found my account was minus. I transferred money from  saving to checking twice time, $ 78 and $60. It isn't enough.   However , I get overdraft charge. I have to pay for her fault. You can see the evidence from the paper that I wrote at bank.       I called customer service and I found hopeless. Because my English is not perfect same as your guy, I got nothing. When I opened account with Wamu, every one (banker) talked good with me. In contrast, when I have a problem , they can not help me.( it 's also my fault.)      I can not find the good reason that I have to pay for overdraft.
