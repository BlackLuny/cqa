qpkNrn8iaa	hes a playa hes jus goin from friend to friend its happen to me b4 dont date him it will hurt your friendship|`|A2O6t6T7aa	dont fall 4 his hottieness it will hurt u and ur friend|`|dlwIp7bGaa	What you gotta do is ask him. Actually better yet, show him. Invite him to your house, get yourself drunk, strip naked. If by the morning you feel like a stretched out piece of meat, then you got a new boyfriend.    Goodluck.|`|4Y3zNYKgaa	Let him poke you
mTKD9GQvaa	I think you should have alcohol there, a wedding should be anice day out for your guests, a chamce to get dressed up, meet up with old friends and family and perhaps take a drink if they do. Your bridesmaids should definitely respect your wishes, as there is nothing worse than someone over doing it and showing themselves up at a wedding. Have a serious talk with them, and maybe get them something small extra as a thank you for not drinking after!!|`|i41tUVtIaa	I would be very careful..if some underaged people were there and they drank and got pulled over you (or your parents) could be held responsible.  If you beleive they won't drink-and how many now days turn down drinking-then go for it.  I think the specific drinks only would be a good idea since most of the party is underage and there will be children there. You just have to becareful nowdays!|`|8nMYS2e2aa	You don't have to have alcohol for people to have fun. if that's the way it is then they are no fun. plus you have some that are underage. and if you and your fiancee aren't really crazy about it then you should just not have it. it also cuts costs. but after all its your wedding so you should do what you and your fiancee want to do. and congratulations!|`|V90Ao2jfaa	alcohol|`|ghItgMZxaa	party hardy. ive never been to a wedding that hasnt had it|`|HRCdQ2vdaa	Since you say cocktail (light drink) they also have the Soda, Beer, Wine package.|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	Get alcohol if you want people to have fun|`|feyZ3bkBaa	That depends where your reception is going to be held. If it's in any place where you are paying for service, then they might have some restrictions. However, if it's somewhere like a park where you are providing everything, then that is up to your discretion. Just don't get caught by the cops :)|`|s6HO32hIaa	I would have alcohol. People relax and let loose a little more when they are drinking and anyone who doesn't want to/can't drink does not have to.
JITTMjasaa	I'm sorry your so stressed. Love can make you crazy, I know. You know she loves you. What's holding her back? Maybe you both should get some couples counseling. Or you could read up on relationship advice. If anything it will make you better at understanding everything. I know you aren't officially a couple but you might as well be. Sounds like you two are crazy for each other but something is holding you both back. If she wants to take it to the next step she will go to couples therapy with you. If not, maybe she isn't ready for you yet. Be patient my friend. These things have a way of working themselves out. Good luck, God Bless.|`|7eBuPdwQaa	The problem in my eyes is that the two of you are in competition with each other and neither one willing to concede.  You seem to both exhibit a little bit of your independence that you don't want to give up by admitting (threat of softening and possibly giving something up) and/or allowing love.  Love is scary because it is about putting yourself secondary to the other, and in doing so, you risk your (possibly competitive) position (mental upper hand) and if you let down your guard, you risk being hurt.  I've been a tomboy myself, have fallen deeply and have been hurt, and even after 21 years of marriage, realize that I have still got a little bit of competitive issues with my husband! The thing to realize and I really wish every married or to be married couple saw, is that a relationship is not easy to maintain, it takes more commitment and hard work, dedication and faith than giving up and walking out ever will.  Someone has to agree to disagree and break the barrier of (lack of honest) communication, bear the soul and reach the other on a deeper level and commit to the long haul NO MATTER the obstacles.  If it is worth it, it will be accomplished.|`|2448b2a74e26e1fd5c72db2621420e5aaa	Awh, that's sweet.  I don't think ignoring her would be the best, it would only make her mad or think that you don't want nothing to do with her.  If she's ignoring your calls or not responding back to you, I suggest finding her and talk about it in person.  You said you two been single since you guys broke up, then I'm guessing she's not over you, and I do agree with you that she loves you, but is afraid to admit it because she's scared she might get hurt.  Maybe go to extreme measures, not desperate.  Do stuff that will make her smile, make her feel all tingly inside.  Like send her flowers, be spontaneous, do stuff you wouldn't normally do, think outside of the box.   Show her you want to be with her forever (:|`|jVQ58AMFaa	toooooooooooooooooooo long you need to shorten it up but, im sorry dude|`|wue0JiaTaa	I'm sorry to say this, but if she's being really clear about not loving you anymore, it is possible that her feelings for you have changed.  There is, of course, the chance that your opinion on the matter of commitment has her scared. I'm sure the fact that you have admited that you are a tad clingy doesn't help.    Perhaps the best solution would be to just slow down a bit, maybe back of a little, let her have some more space in the relationship. Next time she pulls away in the manner you described, sit her down and try to get her to tell you why she is pulling away.    The worst possible thing you could do would be to keep insisting to her that she still loves you. This will make her feel as though you are presuming to be inside her head, which is a bad thing to make a girl believe. Trust me. Just find a time when you are hanging out together, and try to find out what was going wrong so much in your relationship. That's all I can say.|`|riIwX8TZaa	If she's checking your profiles and giving blank calls etc. its because she obviously is missing you but maybe she's just acting a bit 'proud' and waiting for you to act. I think you should approach her but not just by calling or trying to chat but by for example unexpectedly go and meet her at school. You should sit with her and ecplain Your feelings, of all these times you've been breaking up and getting back together, of Now, how you are feeling and really open up. Explain to her how all this affects you and just be sincere. If she loves you and missed you as much as you do, she will certainly grab this chance and try to make things work for you two. Just have a little more "aggresive approach" and meet her; show her that you really care.|`|hDQ2dEupaa	It would help to know what age you are, but in my opinion the most important thing in a relationship is honesty. If you are tired of playing this game with her, weather she loves you or you love her or weather you will be together or not, you need to tell her how you honestly feel and DONT get mad at how she reacts. Like the Buddha said, "with attachment comes suffering", and you need to accept that if you are willing to give her your heart, it is her desicion what she wants to do with it. If she truly loves you, she will come to you, no matter what she says now or in the past. If she wants to fight with you, tell her how much her happiness means to you and that you just want to give her your love. If she doesn't accept this, it maybe because she isn't ready to dedicate her life to someone, especially if she feels that it can be an easy reality. You must listen to your heart and follow your intuition. Just know good things happen to those who wait. Be happy and soon enough she will be in return. you must give her time and space, if she truely needs it, or your future with her may suffer. Best wishes.|`|f1i6DPHFaa	Just give her time, if it's meant to be, it will happen. You can't force these kinds of things. By doing what you've been doing, you're probably scaring her. No woman wants some man chasing her all the time.   For you, I would stop contacting her. Then you will be able to sort your thoughts out better. If you're not constantly talking to her, then you won't always think about her and be so anxious, confused, etc.   If she wants to be with you, she will find you.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Join the Marines and see the world|`|jiCiikXKaa	you need a paradigm shift, my son. your taking a stale approach. your trying to go at it the same way that you always have, you need to have a quick epiphany, boy. got to change your mindset, as long as you give in to the feeling sorry for yourself or pitying her or loving her too much, your giving up on your self, and going out weak. um, theres only one way to do this, and if you know it'll work then by god i guess it will, but you've got to accept the fact that it might not work man. no girl can love you if you can love yourself, you've got to keep your pride, maintain your pride. like that dude in the movie forgetting about sarah marshall is a perfect example. yeah it hurts like hell, but you deal with it like a man, as long as you keep beating yourself up and sending her desperate drunk text messages and feeling like a straight idiot in the morning, not only will you not have the girl, but you will have lost your dignity too, and thats hard to get back. be real about the situation, take a fresh approach, make bold communications, and limit yourself to a certain extent, or ye my friend shall never achieve true closure.
O9jrkjgraa	Just let it go.....you have nothing to do with this problem. He was warned and chose not to follow your advice.|`|UjJCW0goaa	no dude sounds like ur fine. its ther fualt really and u did tell him not to let her, it was his decision. but it sounds like ur sister doesnt really respect u enough to listen wen u tel her not to do something so, u mite want to let her take care of it, u tried to stop it, it aint ur fualt|`|7e0e9a04534a32e816cd47711fb850c9aa	Being a mom, my answer to you is: your sister is responsible for her share of the bill. So check the  s that are not from you guys and tell your sister she has to pay for what ever calls she made before 9pm. By not giving her that responsibility you are not helping her. Though you can help her if you can advance her the money and she pays you back. Put it on paper even if she is your sister. This will help her in the future as to be a responsible person and mother.   When I was her age my big brother helped me, and I paid him back every penny....even if it took me 10 years to do so. It taught me not to take my family for granted.    Good luck!|`|7lMx3So3aa	There are always two sides to every coin, and I can't help but think that there's more to this story.  If he was willing take in your sister and her son, and also found it the proper moral decision to pay for her mistake so his mother didn't have to, I think there must be some other reason that I don't find in your question as to why he's so upset about it and can't let it go.  Have you made any attempt to recover the money from your sister, who is clearly at fault?  She made the calls, right?  Has he had to cover other expenses that were unfair to him?  Are you simply not listening to why he might be so upset over this or not involving him in making decisions like taking on the responsibility of your sister and her child?    No offense, I just think you can probably get the answer from him if you talk to him about it, and truly listen.  The biggest problem in relationships is a lack of honest communication, and since you still don't know why he's upset by this a year later, I don't think you are communicating as you should be.  In what you write, I hear only about who's right and who's wrong, and nothing about the things that have lead up to why he's upset, which leads me to believe that you want blame, not a solution. What have you done to mediate this event?    Also, if $300 is a such a big deal to him, perhaps you weren't in the financial position to help anyone else.  Maybe he's struggling with money and you don't even know it.  That's great to want to help your sister, but if you're willing to take her in to "get her life in order" you must be willing to take that responsibility fully and make sure she gets herself in order, including paying for the things she uses.  Why is it that a full year later, she still hasn't paid?  Have you done anything to help her or just enable her to take advantage or your kindness?  If you love someone, sometimes your best option is not to enable such bad behavior.    In the end, it's not the fault of your boyfriend, he did the right thing, helping several people at his expense, so why then is he still upset?  I think you need to find out what the other side of that coin looks like, ask him, love him, and try to understand.  Oh, and at least show that you are trying to recover his money.  Maybe that's all he wants is for you to respect him, and not to feel like you're allowing him to be taken advantage of.  Forget the money, I don't think it's about that, I think there's more going on and it's your job to find out why he's upset.
O9jrkjgraa	Popularity in school is fleeting .....    Not anything that means anything in the real world. I wanted nothing to do with those shallow cruel people. I had a great time with my wonderful friends.|`|J77NbCXBaa	I've been out of high school for 4 years now and I'm glad. I say you do not need to be in the "in" crowd to have fun. I know I wasn't and I still had a blast! Just hanging out with people you like is the best thing ever.

But I love his pet snail, Gary!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	yes, one cause my home would always smell like pinapples and since hes a fry cook i'd never be hungry and i'd have a snail that meows how cool is that.|`|b7TueUUPaa	honestly yes, if my boyfriend doesn't propose soon! lol.  i love patrick! i'd smack squidward! and i'd make ms. puff do that puffy thing i love so much! i'd wreak havock all over bikini bottom|`|t4Amxi9vaa	Nope|`|WtNW8HcPaa	Hmmm - probably. Life under the sea in a pineapple seems a lot less confusing...and cheaper.
0fVtHNtmaa	Don't feel that way, your dad is trying to protect you. I know it's a bit much. My dad did it too, but he loves you so stop hating him.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	OMG. You're so not going to like this, but I don't care.     Okay, so your Dad is protecting you, he doesn't want you to get hurt, and he's punishing you for breaking the rules - uh, sorry but what am I missing here? Sounds to me like you're just mad that you got grounded or something. Besides, getting your phone or laptop taken away is nothing compared to the punishment that some people get....you've got it EASY compared to the way I had it growing up. I got my  phone and computer taken away, I couldn't go anywhere, couldn't have company, couldn't even listen to music if I was ten minutes late coming home. And ummm you're complaining about a phone and a computer??? How about this - Try NOT being late, for once, and maybe you won't have a reason to complain! Try talking to your Dad about things rationally, like an adult, instead of "confronting" him and yelling at him like you probably do. I know that you're absoluvely convinced beyond reason that he's trying as hard as he can to make your life miserable, but he DOES know better than you. Oh, and by the way...that's a REALLY low-down reason to "hate" your Dad. At least he cares about you.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	grow up... follow the rules... hes trying to look after you.. there is much wrost a dad can do to his kids... ive been there well i am ther...|`|VhrUtQc2aa	yeah father's what can you do you cant change them.    Tell your dad that you cant change that theirs guys outside and that its not your fault that the bus is late which makes you 10 min late and that it's unfare that he takes your phone and laptop for this reason.    Tell your dad if I can't confrount you or talk to you about anything who do i go and talk to explain that he is the parent and he needs to learn to listen to you and give eachother time and respect when you both talk to eachother.    Don't say you wish your father was dead yes we feel it when we get up set and angry but at the end of the day he is your father and he does love you even if he does not show you the right way    good luck|`|dEjHCUsgaa	i hate my dad too i wish he would ******* die he is such a dick as well i force me to eat food i dont like or he'll scream at me and hit me that happened just know and i am crying and i cry every night i wish he would ******* die and he doesnt even give me any prize if i do big achiement and he laughs at me in front of all my friends when i do something wrong  i wish he would die|`|MM4XtxADaa	You'll hate to hear it, but you have it so easy with your dad. All he does is take away your entertainment as penalty {unless used hwk-wise}. Now my dad has serious long-term anger management. I hate him (on the surface, really), not to the extent of killing him, just wish he's out of my sight. Probably think I'd be dead by now if it weren't for my mom since my dad easily overexaggerates on tiny problems. For example, just today, we were planning to go on a dinner at my dad's close friend, and just because I took too long doing my hair, he ticked off like a bomb. (exploded beyond control, so ridiculously that he looked like he was dancing)|`|ViKERS0Taa	well, break his rules. And let him know you're breaking them to show him that you don't want him to be insane about stuff anymore. If he pushes you or hits you, call the cops.
zHothyW6aa	I think you should let the bride maids decide what hair they like best on themselves... maybe you could gently nudge them in the direction you like best... I think you will be much happier with pictures of bridesmaids that are comfortable with their look then of girls with the same hair do... However if they all like your hair idea go for it...|`|E7LQp6VRaa	My advice is to let them choose their own hairstyle... you will have much happier bridesmaids...|`|DqetlSB6aa	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gp0lWXXB-90/R-...    id do something like this|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	well I think your bridesmaids will look like men with their hair slicked back that tight.  And the second one for you...nnooooooo.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	- The second hairstyle is just.. not right.  - The first hairstyle looks like something that beyonce or J-lo have done... I think it would be a neat bun at the back. I'm sure the hairdresser could discuss it with you beforehand.    Found a link! I searched Jennifer Lopez updo on Google  http://getsomehairapy.files.wordpress.co...    That link is from this website... and I really like the Kristin Chenowith hairstyle, check it out. It would look great with your dress too.  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...    This is an interesting back:  http://www.hairstyles53.com/wp-content/u...
gx7s1M5gaa	High school is way too young to propose to her, even if she is the one.    A promise ring might be nice, though.|`|pMsMx817aa	its definetly different|`|384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	i think its a cute video if you guys are into that kind of thing. I think she'll love it...|`|DQlZIzAFaa	please please please just wait until you finish freshman year of college. if she's really the one for you, and you plan to be with her your whole life, waiting one more year won't be that bad.    90% of couples I know who were together all through high school didn't make it through their freshman year of college. the 10% who did are now getting married.    being an adult and living on your own at college changes the type of person you are.
5fa929d9fbdd5fdf9e744c8cc040bd76aa	I personally am not a fan of the tulle, it really screams 90's wedding with big puffy sleeves.  Besides, nobody is going to remember what your ceiling looked like, whether you have tulle or not.|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	i reallt like it. but who cares what i think, do you like it?|`|lYZ71zYAaa	I like the tulle, It does soften the room. With out it the ceiling looks like your in someones basement. very cold. Go with the tulle.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	wow, golf course function halls look the same the world over! It looks just like one of the centres I was considering. personally I would keep the tulle and fairy lights and release some helium ballons with ribbons to drift around the ceiling, or do a balloon net over the dance floor and as you have your first dance have it released so that the balloons cascade around you|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	I have to say - I'm not a big fan of it.  I think it makes it a bit more "Sweet 16/Quincenera" rather than sophisticated bride. :)|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I dont like the tulle and lights.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Ugh...no dont do that..take it down|`|pp5dhbIoaa	I like it.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I think it really softens the look of the room.  It doesn't look cheesy at all.  Do it.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	na it looks fine.  Without it, it would just look like a living room.|`|jgaRcmi7aa	i really like it :D   i'm stealing the idea !!!|`|vhMe2oCGaa	I personaly dont like the lights and tulle but i do think that if the celing tiles were cover with some sort of flowy floaty material and draped it on the ceiling all meeting in the middle (which could easily be put up with a gun stapeler the stapels wouldnt be seen.) and then the lights you would get a very beautiful and dream arabian tent like celling which i personally do like   good luck and i hope i helped
71VRvldJaa	Unlike the movies and romance novels, the first time is never what you think it's going to be so I wouldn't spend the next week or two trying to plan what's going to happen.  Being your first time, more likely than not you won't last very long at all........that's just the way it is.  Just go with the flow and let happen what's going to happen.    Edit:  Just for the record, Toxic21's information is inaccurate.  For people who have an ongoing problem with premature ejaculation during intercourse, it is recommended that you DO masturbate and ejaculate on your own, prior to having intercourse with your partner.  It often takes the "edge" off so that you WON'T ejaculate as quickly when having intercourse with your partner.|`|LVpyaf48aa	sounds like you need to make a doctor appointment to have everything checked to make sure its working properly. no one here can fix a broken pecker.|`|Umsj08pnaa	If you're a virgin, whether you like it or not, you will only last about two or three minutes.

NO TOUCHING. hands off it, don't look, read, or have anything to do with sex, no oral, no masturbating i mean cold turkey..u want it to be intense don't u?     yes u risk the possibility if shooting off before the time when u actually have sex because u went cold turkey but second round will be a blessing to u.    and tips to make it last longer? is to thrust a bit, when u feel urself coming, u stop, pull out and breath, kiss and do other things then continue...yes this is a teasing method and might frustrate the hell out of her..but LOL from my guy friends..they have the nail marks to prove it ended all good|`|UQlfW4sAaa	Get some Spanish Fly.

71VRvldJaa	I don't think it's got anything to do with the baby's mother.  I think he's just not wanting to be with you anymore so I'd let him go!
9kHN3ar0aa	my parents were the same way if not worse until i went to college. they were always checking on me, reading through texts in my phone, trying to read over my shoulder while i was on the computer and whatnot. and they would never let me go anywhere without asking me a million questions first and half the time i wouldn't be allowed to go in the end anyway. but don't run away! i ran away for 2 weeks once and it didn't do any good! when i came back they were just as strict as before. (the 2 weeks gone were rather fun though lol) i would talk to them and try to tell them how you feel. ask for something little at first like being able to sleep with the door closed. and explain to them that it helps you sleep and maybe it will be easier for them to understand. eventually it will get a little better, but my guess is you will never have as mush freedom as you desire. i sure didn't. i guess they are doing it for your own good and "you will understand when you are older" as my parents would say lol. so just wait it out until college and appreciate the time you do have to yourself! b/c again, right now all you can do is talk to them and hope they understand how you are feeling. good luck to you!|`|4qYvmPweaa	Don't run away.   It will just cause a lot of pain and anguish for your parents.   I know right now with the frustration you are dealing with it sounds like a great idea.   Just sit down and talk to your parents.   Tell them that you have a good head on your shoulder and they cannot protect you from everything in life. The grand thing about being a kid is making mistakes and learning from them.   I hope everything works out for you and you get a little more room on the leash....|`|w5KFkyGRaa	Sit down and talk to them about this. don't accuse them just sit down and tell them how you feel about this. and i agree your parents are totally overprotective.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	tell them to back off  theres not much you can do till your 18  but i told my mom off  and she actually loosened up a bit  your parents might...hopefully|`|11NYzhLAaa	That SUCKS! Man, I thought I had it bad. Maybe you should ask your parents if you could live with a less-strict relative. Is your grandma nice? Ask your parents if you could move in with your grandma.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	Thank your parents for loving you as much as they do! Running away will only get you put into an already over crowded juvenile system that will put you in worse situations than what you have to deal with now.|`|uttbqGB9aa	Your parents are overprotective, but because they LOVE YOU!    You are getting older and do need your privacy, I agree with you, but you don't need to resent your parents for caring about you so much. Talk to them about it and express your feelings maturely.     Tell them that you understand their concerns but you feel that you deserve a little more privacy, you should come to some sort of agreement.    If not, tough it out until you are old enough to move out.     Parents love should be a cherished thing not something complained about. In no way am I dissing you because I understand your need for privacy, What I am getting at is that you should accept what they do BECAUSE they LOVE YOU so much.    Some people don't have that kind of love from parents, some kids are out on the street and get killed because their parents can care less what happens to them.    Some kids don't even have parents...orphans waiting for someone to love them the way your parents love you. Some are even waiting on someone to accept them and tell them not to close their door because they "are afraid of fire".    Go log off of here and hug your parents...tell them you love them.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Please don't run away.    My parents are very over-protected also, I'm 15 myself and parents just want to protect you from strangers that's why they won't let you go place sometimes. I know its a pain in the neck but your parents love you so much they don't want anything bad to ever happen to you. Maybe your parents always check on you bcos they are insecure and worry about dangers that can occur at any time. Or maybe they just want to give you a huge cuddle just to show how much they care for you.    Your a teenager and they suspect mistakes from you, but they try to prevent it from happening.  Mums also have a tendency to worry ALOT, I mean if you were a mother yourself you would know how it feels.    Are you also an only child? If so parents will be very protected bcos you are their only child, and what if you were to go missing or something, they will be childless.    Tell your parents they are getting on your nerves and you need your space and their trust.|`|GFZvKx8caa	tell them how you feel|`|K62ll0Zxaa	talk to them about it, because that is going to drive you away from them and you might want to move out as soon as you can, if they don't stop(but don't tell them that)|`|89cCKrm8aa	you gotta tell your parents that you've grown up and your not a little kid anymore, tell them you want to do things like go out. If they dont understand then tell someone in your family like your uncle or aunt about it|`|eYq5vYm2aa	please dont run away.....they love you that much....tell hem how you feel .....maybe theyll ease up a bit.....but there just looking out for. u...in todays world kids your age act 30......i got pregnant at 16.....grant it i love my daughter....but i droped out......and its soo hard........ill b 23 soon......and ive wised up alot bu i had to learn the hard way in life if only i had parents who gave a **** maybe i wouldnt b in the predicament im in now....wich is stripping to make ends meet....they may be annoying so try to understand where there coming from|`|0vhx7Putaa	As crazy at is sounds they are only looking after you. Sorry to say but in time you will see they only want whats best for you. You're only 14, the next 6 or so years are going to get raelly crazy and you will slowly get more freedom. Just enjoy being young and knowing they care for you.|`|VYEJXGutaa	Talk to them! If you've never done anything to make them distrust you then you need to talk to them. Ask them if you've ever given them any reason not to trust you. Tell them that whether they like it or not your growing up and a teenage girl needs a little bit of privacy to grow and find her own way. Tell them you feel suffocated. That although you love them and understand that they are over protective because they love you and want you to be safe you need room to be your own person and discover life on your own. My mom did something with me when I was your age that I thought was very reasonable- during the day when I went to just hang out with my friends in the neighborhood I had to physically check in at my house every hour. Eventually after I proved I could be trusted she would let me go out with groups of friends at night (movies, bowling, ect....) but Ihad to call to check in every hour. Eventually I had gained her trust to the point where she didn't ask me to check in anymore, I could just come and go ( I was 16 by this point) but ya know I had become so used to it that even though I didn't have to I still called her when I went somewhere to let her know i was ok. Maybe you could tell this story to them and suggest they try it out. Trust has to be earned slowly but they have to give you the chance to earn it. As parents who are scared of what might happen to you in an increasingly scary world it might be hard for them but you are teenager who needs to live her own life. Maybe if you talk to them they will remember what it was like to be your age. Wow that was long lol hope it helped.|`|fyE6XwdKaa	Don't run away. Just sit down and talk to them. If you run away you will have nothing. It is better off to have a home and a family that loves you. Just talk to your parents and tell them how you feel.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Oh I remember this age.(about 10 years ago) My parents did the same thing and really, they just want what's best for you. I used to sneak out and was a rebel. I wasn't the greatest teen. My poor parents. You will realize once your older why they did this.  But out of respect, you should try to talk to them and tell them  how you feel. if they won't budge, I'm sorry you have really strict parents.  I got to the point to where my parents said I couldn't do something, then I'd do it anyway.   Tell them you need some space because they are smothering you. As long as you follow their rules(like a set curfew), they should let you have some freedom. And btw, BOYS are what they worry about most! lol Maybe if it gets too bad, have your friends parent talk to yours and tell them your will be staying the night, and they just need some assurance you will be okay because their baby is growing up. Yeah they are annoying sometimes aren't they?  As far checking up on you, my parents did the same thing, because I've gotten caught so many times not in my bed.   Good luck|`|4HXAsvLnaa	You should tell them to calm down and that you are grown up and more mature to take care of your self.|`|ItEUj0miaa	My parents were like that when I was a kid just voice how you feel and if they don't agree with you keep doing it also ask your parents if there parents were this protective when they were kids and if they werent ask them how they would feel if they were in your position.|`|4sRvEHdRaa	maybe you should try talking to them if you haven't already. Tell them how you are feeling about it all because that's just horrible. My parents were always very understanding of me and my privacy. Are you the oldest? because sometimes they dont want to take chances with the oldest cuz they're not sure what to do. you need to talk to them! that's just ridiculous! tell them how you feel and dont be afraid to do it! Good luck!|`|NJrsrT12aa	I'd sit down and talk to them and ask them for the reasons on why they're doing this.    Have you ever done anything to lose their trust?    Your mom probably checks on you in the night to see if you snuckout or something.      If your parents don't change, talk to a school counselor about it and they will get it through to your parents' thick skulls that it's abnormal for you to be secluded from boys and social events like that.    Trust me, having an adult counselar talking to your parents sounds better then coming from a teenager.    Try to make them trust you.    If all else fails, lie to them about what you're doing and just don't get caught if you want to hang out with boys.
PXpeP7j1aa	My dad does a similar thing except when he asks me to hang out it usually means that he has some work that needs done but he does not want to do it. My best answer is to tell him. I told my dad that it was really bad on his part but him being who he is he just does not give a crap. I wish you better luck and a better relationship with your father than I have with mine!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Discuss this with him. Id have to say I am guilty of doing this myself, no matter how hard I try. I spent so little time with the kids do to them having thier own friends and life, its the only time I could mention things. Let him know, in the future its about hanging out and keeping it off topic of family matters or forget it, hell get the point hopefully.|`|zY64xc6xaa	He's trying to be a guiding force in your life, but apparently screwing up royally.    Tell him you'd like to hang out without hearing a word about every bad decision you may have made in your life, and see what he says.    I understand.  My mom used to tease me endlessly if I told her I had a crush on a boy.  Then she wondered why I stopped telling her.|`|89cCKrm8aa	tell him that he criticizes you, and ask him to stop. And if he continues to criticize you then tell him your not gonna hang out with him anymore|`|MbRygPqTaa	Nobody Teaches parents how to be parents. Don't take it personal, hes just trying. That said you have to have your territory or stand up for what you feel is right.  You probably know when your dad is calm and taking you seriously and when he is not right?   So, be in control of the situation by being the one who brings up the need to talk in a Quiet, Private place (people dont like to be amushed or embarased infront of others) .Or, you take the initiative to go somewhere, at your time, so you are in control. Then (pay attention to your body language) be serious and direct but not judgmental, state your case about what is wrong and what You want to do about it.   So maybe something around these lines.  Dad, i appretiate you taking your time to hang out with me, and being interested in my life. I know you are always trying to teach me the best and encouraging me to be the best. And while we may disagree about my decitions i want you to understand i Do listen to your ideas and think about them. But I feel you might not consider my point of view. (he will try to intervene here if hes not feeling you are serious) Please remember that im doing the best i can, you are a great father that has tought me so much, but I have to make my own decitions and learn from my mistakes. I understand this is hard, but i feel you should support me so these mistakes are learning experiences instead of debilitating experiences. Im a good person and I will act like one, just trust me like i trust you.  Noone gets it 100% right, even the best.   So I would like to... speak about what you feel at home and when outside have a diferent relationship. Or anything you want, just remember to keep it fair for both sides.  I know its a monologue, but it Will impress him! Seriously!   Remember that acknologing His points of view or what he is saying, will make him feel that he Is getting through to you and that you have a logic. Even if you dont really agree with what he says, what YOU WANT is for him to Hear your point of view.  Afterwards so he doesnt feel cornered, make the rest of the day fun! Since You are in control of the situation, you can decide what to do or where and when to go.  You could even have it written down so you dont forget anything and dont drift.   Hope this helps, let me know!
Tpa7wcQXaa	Get out of this situation FAST!  I actually had a member of my extended family in a situation like this with her stepfather.  You need to tell someone of authority RIGHT AWAY! It IS just like you grandfather's situation!  Oh I am so worried for you, I feel very personally connected to this!  Tell you're mother. As soon as you can. Your father will obviously deny it and things will be rocky but if you dont, the situation is going to be wrose. A lot worse.  You WILL get hurt if you dont!  Apart from telling your mother you need, and I stress this, you need to tell either a guidance counsellor or teacher, and file a police report as fast as you can.  You are not paranoid, from your past experiences you are just more knowledgable about the warning signs and your body is telling you this is not ok.  Even the shaving the legs comment, was inappropriate. ONLY my bf has ever said something like that jokingly to me, my father would never ever talk about anything related to my body.  PLEASE get yourself out of this situation!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You have ever reason to be extra-watchful when it comes to men, even your own family. Your body is your own - you have every right to protect it!     Next time your Dad starts doing something that makes you uncomfortable, tell him loudly and firmly, "Dad, STOP THAT. You're making me uncomfortable!" And if he gets angry again, just say "Fine, if I'm in trouble about this we'll go talk to Mom." And you march straight to wherever your Mom is and tell her about it if it doesn't stop right away!     I know from personal experience what it's like to have to second-guess your own family because of what someone else did to you. I know how it feels to be afraid to tell and to not want to cause drama, and that kind of thing. But you absolutely cannot put a price on peace of mind! Molestation is something that you never really get over...you just have to learn to co-exist with it, as I'm sure you've guessed by now. You do NOT have to take it from anyone. So if something happens that you don't want or that makes you uncomfortable, TELL someone!     Good luck....|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Maybe he's just trying to be closer to you b/c of what happened, but in my opinion, these behaviors are completely inappropriate, especially if they have only recently surfaced. And if they are making you uncomfortable, you should talk to your mother about it. Maybe he doesn't mean to do it, but who knows. You need to tell someone.|`|k0x99dGraa	First of all you need to tell your father it makes you feel uncomfortable and if he gets angry then that is a sure sign that he knows he is not doing something right. I would also tell your mother immediately. If she doesn't do anything about it then go to a school counselor. This is not a good thing...|`|89cCKrm8aa	tell him how you feel, and its kinda weird that a man kisses his 15 year old girl on the lips|`|ViKERS0Taa	JUUUSTT leave. go live at a friends house. Seriously just go. who knows what the **** ur grandpa taught your dad. seriously normal parents dont do that. you are not paranoid, you are correct. LEAVE.|`|4HXAsvLnaa	Hmm rubbing your legs sounds weird and trying to kiss you. Maybe you should ask your mother for guidance|`|SOkhzMVDaa	im a 16 yr old girl and i completely understand although my dad has never told me to shave and i too think that would be a little strange... but just tell you dad you like hugs better.... or if your too scared next time he tries to just give him a hug and hide ur face in his arm or shoulder so he cant and if he asks for a kiss give him your cheek your dad seems like he is just trying to give you some love but i am not that affectionate to my parents and everytime i see me grandpa he wants a kiss on the lips and i alwyas just go straight for the hug cus i get a lil but werided out. so i completly understand. your dads really just wants to give you some love but you need to show him your boundries without coming off rude. Hopefully i helped and didnt make things worse but you just need to show them you limits in the nicest way possible and your dad will forgive you!! its not your fault you didnt want a kiss on the lips! (although i did kiss my dad on the lips when i was younger)     hopefully my tactics work!
89cCKrm8aa	im vietnamese so i call my grandpa:ong noi or ong nguoai i call my grandma: ba noi or ba nguoai. noi:is for my dad's side and nguoai is for my mom's side|`|zY64xc6xaa	Mammaw and Pappaw, pronounced MAMM-ma and PAPP-pa.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	well in my parents country (egypt) we call grandma teta and grandpa gedo|`|Wal4I5Foaa	THEY CALL IT LOLO AND LOLA IN TAGALOG|`|xjhVRCJxaa	Gelo and Gelita, it derives from "abuelo" and "abuelita" (Mexico)|`|k0x99dGraa	My grandfather is called Chops. In my family anything that is cheap or cheesy... we call chops. So say your out shopping and your friend presents you with a really frumpy sweater and asks your opinion... you would say... oh no way, that sweater is so chops! It's a term of endearment towards my grandfather of course! And then my grandma... being a heavy set lady we would call PORK! So in all I have a grandma named Pork, and a grandpa named chops... anyone hungry?|`|SOkhzMVDaa	bb and papa|`|nSsIGlF1aa	Poppy and Nina are what my chilren call my parents... they just do no real reason why!|`|KwNpyp3saa	My grandmother was called Mami.

VTlilFu9aa	ignore it  im assuming you are in high school/ middle school or whatever  im in high school and i have to deal with this kind of stuff and the easiest way to is to just ignore it  i know it sounds cliche and all that but if you just walk away if she starts something it will either blow over or she'll still make fun of you or whatever    and if she starts bullying you you can tell an administrator and they will deal with it    it sounds like a ***** move but they deal with **** like that and you dont want to spend your high school life living in fear of another girl for a dumb reason its just not worth four years of inside hurt    if she stares at you dont freak out just either stare back or pretend you dont notice if does the passive aggressive thing like walk past you and say mean things or whatever just pretend you dont hear.    the more you pretend she doesnt exist the more she diminshes in meaning to you and the more she diminishes in meaning to herself    and like i said if all else fails just tell the principle s/he will be like aww snap no she didnt and deal with it|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes - just ignore her. She apparently loves drama, stay away.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	trip her coming out of lockerroom|`|ZIU0nI3faa	Ignore her, don't concern yourself with other peoples problems, it's hers not yours. She's like that and will just have to accept it. We live in a cruel, cruel world unfortunately.|`|ZaPj1OIbaa	Just ignore her, don't let her get you down. When this happened to me i was really upset and just kind of stood around. If you ignore her she'll stop with the looks. Just hang out with your other friends in the class, if you don't have any just talk to the nice people, or the ones you sometimes talk to, she's obviously not worth your attention. I hope i helped i would hate for anyone else to have to go through the whole horrible cycle of this situation. :D|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Begin with attempting small-talk. Maybe something deeper is bothering her, so ask and find out. Be warm and friendly towards her, and let her know that you are concerned. Hopefully, whatever it is that's wrong may easily be resolved. Good luck. :)
n195n9Avaa	No, I have always been picky and it paid off. I am with the perfect man and I am glad things worked out the way they did :)|`|jJwuMTSqaa	I am sure everyone at times will feel this. However, things happen for a reason. If it was not meant to be, than it isn't meant to be.|`|UldvbAIWaa	ya well im a hopeless romantic so w.e lol soo. ya i think about it, but the more i think about my past ones or the one i thought was the one. i ***** have been more wrong about anything. and you can always find another love|`|bzfXbM4raa	Yep...I wonder about it often.  I first met her in February, she gave me her number, called me a few times, but I never returned her calls.  I met her again in May, again I didn't pick up her calls.  I figured she was a model, so had no substance.  When I finally decide to randomly call her in September, it was too late for us to have a relationship.  Now it's almost a year since I first met her, and I find she's an amazing person, and we're in a very very strange friendship/relationship.  If I actually called her last year, it would've been simplier.|`|u6epy56uaa	Men don't wonder about this, unless they're rely sensitive like girls.It sounds like you rely miss that guy...  You should be open and tell that person, maybe, he has been thinking the same things.
DSMmF2Xuaa	Yupz. I got a feeling i'll be lonely too. =( Haiz..|`|AA11817078	v-day is a festival of love, so it not necessary that you have to spend that day only with your b/f or g/f, you can enjoy this occasion with anybody whom you love and care like your mom, dad, friends, relative classmate, even a pet will do.
kcooCdUGaa	Ignore it the best you can and don't argue for a day or so.  Then ask him what's going on and if u start to argue walk away. If talking doesn't  work he's not good enough for you.

And a girl. I am a truly reliable friend, and I have stopped many friends from suicide, so insanity is not an issue for me. I will willingly stick around for as long as you'd want me to. And I'd be glad to do so. And a lot is going on in my life, also. E-mail me, if you'd like. cheekyone773@yahoo.com|`|ZaPj1OIbaa	i will, i'm a girl 13 and i'm on a lot and have the same stress problem. i can't be on for a few days after this because ii'm away.|`|aqKIOjHqaa	hey you don't have friends.  do not worry .  you like to be a friend. of mine.  i am not a girl nor of 13 but i am 20. if you think we could be friends.
AA11423026	Smile alot and be cheerful, positive and lively.|`|hA6JDWsFaa	show that your confident in yourself, good vibes rub off on people and they'll notice how much of a positive and optimistic person you are. and don't be too shy to start small talk! ask small questions like "hey, can you help me out with this problem, i don't get it.." or say small compliments to potential friends like "those are really nice shoes! i like the color on them.." etc. and always have a smile on your face :)    good luck!|`|K62ll0Zxaa	omg me too! lol it kinda sucks when ur new and the peeps u hang out with have been hanging out with each other for years so u dont really know what they're talking about most of the time, idk what to tell you,  hang out with me! lol|`|f4948af1972489366cde074ab64b0d89aa	I've moved a couple times and it's tough.  What I found that was helpful is find people with similar interests as you.  Then breaking the ice is as simple as doing that common activity.  Another thing to do is to be yourself.  Don't worry about what others think about you.  If you're yourself and they don't like you, sucks for them and you know they wouldn't make a good friend.    hope this helps|`|uI4WPwhsaa	be yourself...caring about what others think holds you back!!|`|nfn01Xsfaa	i think that u could probably tell the people u have classes with that ur new and they probably knwo it. so whoever is friendly to talk with u, go ask them when they have lunch and if u can have lunch with them. since ur new. they mite understand.    u need to get the courage first to talk with ANYBODY. in general. maybe u could even ask ur mom or ur parents for advice if they are likely to listen.    they probably know ur personality better than you do.    u say u want to make friends u can be urself with..    is it part of your personality to be outgoing? if it is, then flow with it and be outgoing and make firends YOUR* own way.|`|ZPYCus4xaa	Try not to get carried away with your words.    Be calm, but most importantly act yourself.|`|40i3ycHyaa	just be your self people will like you for who you are dont act different because then they wont like you for who you are|`|vmx1VZnTaa	be yourself|`|WbcDIz2laa	Join social events, clubs, and after school activities.   Be open about yourself and try not to be shy.   Don't be loud and annoying, just be you--- in a working evironment until you get comfortable enough to show them the loud and way too fun you.     Talk to people about music, movies, concerts, school related gossip--example what did you think about the prep rally. Talk to them about fashion, family matters---don't go deep just skim across what everyone else has problems with; example: grounding for cell phone overages.     Since you dont join after school activities because you dont have a ride. Just socialize online with classmates. Socialize in class. Usually its the class before lunch so you'd have someone to sit with. Just give them your house number. Make a study-buddy.     I dont know if any of that made any sense.
4gvCdwWPaa	More than Likely, ChYeAh!|`|BxAPrXlzaa	no.. it could mean anything! it could just be anything important to him/her.. doesn't mean that they had sex|`|XNoVFyqHaa	Oh god...people are so lame...haha ugh. Why do people post **** like that on myspace??
2pfAw4Xkaa	Pure jealousy. She doesn't want to see you make positive changes in your life because she is lacking something in hers. Maybe a significant other? Or she's probably unhappy with something in her life. I say good for you for trying to better yourself by getting healthier psychically and mentally. Ignore her. She is a type of person to rain on anyone else parade if it is better then hers. Don't let her know it gets to you. I am sure you love her as a your cousin but that doesn't mean you have to put up with her crap. So continue to make these positive changes in your life. Do not share any good news with her for a while. She will realize shes being mean for no reason. Make your money and find your own place. Good luck!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Some people just aren't happy unless they're making others miserable.     Your cousin sounds like one of those people! It also sounds like she's insanely jealous of you and would rather you stay there with her, under her thumb, unhappy with your weight and unable to move. But you're right about one thing...tax time is here, and if I were you, I wouldn't say one word to her about anything until it's time to act on it. Don't tell her you're going to find an apartment and move until you've found one and paid the deposit on it. And don't tell her you've been dieting until you've actually lost some weight. Imagine how nice it will feel, when she says "You'll never find an apartment" you can give her a sh!t-eating grin and go "Well I guess hell froze over and pigs can fly, because I paid my deposit two days ago."    Good luck!|`|eYq5vYm2aa	relax senstive sally shes just busting your balls...me and my cousin are like that we do it back and forth|`|SOkhzMVDaa	she sounds a little bit jealous and like a negetive nancy.   my cousin actually does the same thing and it really gets on my nerves  and we get in fights about this. try to let it go and just think about when you move out. and it sounds like you cant share your excitment with her so just save it for some of your friends and skip telling your cousin.|`|ViKERS0Taa	ya either she's jealous or she wants you to stay so she doesnt want you to get a good refund.|`|89cCKrm8aa	yea she's being really negative and you should go move in with someone else
dSMb8JDvaa	Hard to say? It is depends on your personality though...May be your expectation is too high? Or you just a working man or NOT working , and love to do your own things AT HOME? You have to get opportunity to go out and make (girl) friends, I think. I don't rec commence you to find girl from the internet but if it just only way, you preferred. Just click on this side or do you own Research before you approaching the girl...may help.|`|16FNUHUiaa	you don't really need it. it sucks to be alone, so maybe choose to spend more time with your friends, pursuing your other interests/hobbies/sports/whatever.  you'll be in a relationship soon enough.
VLRkJOOuaa	I think you should leave them off of your invitation list. Only if they ask why they're not invited, you owe them an explanation -- and maybe even a little 'cease fire' time to gather the lost love.      I don't think your friends are intentionally trying to upset you; it just sounds like they've found interests that are different than yours but mean a lot to them, obviously.      I've never really experienced being the "third wheel," but from what I've seen and heard, it really does suck.    When I'm with my friends, I'm usually the one leading the conversation; I have a lot of things to talk about so it never really gets awkward. There was this one time, though; my friend, just like me, is a natural-born leader... we like the feeling of empowerment control gives us.    Well... she purposely spread rumors about me so that my friends would get mad at me (she's one of those people that isn't happy unless they're first at everything). We had a little war-time and well... we learned to put the past behind us (where it belongs).    I know my situation was very different than yours, but I still saw some similarity in it. What it honestly looks like is your friends trying to play leader.      Good luck! (:|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	I know how you feel cause it happened to me, too.... a total coincidence my bestie's name is Christina,too although the spelling is Kristina...you are the only one who knows what's the answer to those matter that is troubling you.... but I'll try my best to give you an advice... Please forgive me if I became out of the line! there are reasons for that maybe your just thinking that way or.... the other reason is a bit long......    you said it's your birthday and your planning to invite them, right? How do I explain this..... they may make you wait everytime you go out with em  but have you ever think of this..... it's your birthday so i think that they'll not make you wait for hours like before.... if they're really your friend they'll do not hang around and entertain themselves buying fashion items and jewelries instead they'll spend more time on you cause it's your birthday.... You need to be sure before you cancel your invitation to them... why don't you give it a shot and invite them..... or if you really wanna find the answer I think you should tell them how you feel by their actions in a nice way....  Maybe they just don't know that their actions troubled you inside....     I'm not hoping my answer help you coz i think it's lame.... but i tried my best to help....|`|XNIkS3KNaa	I've been in this same situation. lol  It's a tough spot to be in.  On any other day I would try my best to go out with them one at a time that way you're not left out so much, but as for your birthday adventure I would invite them.  It might hurt their feelings if you don't and that's never good.  Since you'll have more then just those two it should be ok and you'll probably have more fun actually with many people.  You're kind of in a no win situation, speaking from experience. :)    Sorry I couldn't help more! :)|`|TkPJYlaMaa	It doesn't sound like you're having fun at all my friend, personally I think you should tell these girls how you feel, but that's just me. For the indirect approach if they starty talking about that stuff, sneak into the conversatuion add something that leadse to another topic and when they're drwan in you take charge of the talk and keep reins. But if you want to avoid all the crap together, just say no and find other freinds to hang with|`|nyeUUojFaa	find some new friends. these girls arent ur friend type.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Okay this may not be "completely" related to your question but I had to say:  I used to have somewhat of a similar problem to this but I got so bored hangin' round the same people so I branched off to different groups of people. Basically during lunch time at school I rotate with 12 different "groupies" ...I mean, I seriously just can't be stuck with the same people all the time, it gets really dull after awhile.   Don't isolate yourself with only these two in your life because there is a whole world to explore.  You really have to find your own niche.  Sometimes it just takes awhile to find where who your most happy with.  Stay friends with them, don't ditch them but work on building relationships with other people.
2iDvyoXhaa	All you can do is be honest. It's not like you're being unreasonable or anything. You're entitled to your own space.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Its always hard to tell it like it is especially to the one that helped you out the most.     For the most part, I think you should tell H how much you have appreciated how much she has done for you, helping out with the friend thing and all. But, there's this hunch that tells me that H really likes you, but you don't (obviously).    I think that you should kindly tell H that you really like J, and that you really need your space. You can't have H leaning on you like this forever. Tell her.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Why don't you have another friend ask H to lunch one day so that you can take J? And when she wants to get together on a Friday night, just tell her "oh, sorry. We're having a guys night tonight. Maybe some other time."    Or when it's just you and H for lunch, tell her that you really like J and would like to ask her out. Then she'll get the idea that she's one of the crowd.|`|mHXLJKzRaa	first of all you sound very selfish, u had a friend that would stand by your (H) and now you're gonna leave her just because you care about your reputation?!?? come on man she's one of your first friend why you gonna let her hang like that.     and as for J, if you want to spend more time with her, do it after school, then u will find out if she really likes you or not, or maybe that you are just infactuated with her only lol the high school years.     as for lunch, why dont you invite the girls with you to the guys table, the guys will think you're holy or something since you got two girls hanging around with you, nothing to be ashamed of.    as for what people think, i say forget what they think, i care not and if theres another girl that interests me then i'll talk to her and get to know her.you're in the teen years where you think everyone is looking and noticing you but they arent', lol even if someone stares at you, u start looking to see what's wrong with you, i hope you get out of the egotistic stage soon enough. with the path that you want to take, by telling H that you dont want to be BFF, you'll be losing friends you can't have again especially if J ends up liking someone else than you|`|IEZr9yjhaa	Hon,  I am sorry to tell you this but these girls are using you. Why not leave your car home a couple if days and you might see a change in these girls.  If this J is really your friend she will understand. Just tell her that you just want to go to lunch with her and not her friends Also when you are out to lunch with her tell her that you have made some guy friends and would like to hang out with them sometime too. If she is really your friend she will totally understand.
mGPZ69pLaa	What it is,is that he really cares about you and has strong feelings you.So he dont want you to get hurt or anything hapening to you.Many guys see many friends as siblings cuz of their personaility and attitude,especially the way you act towards them.All he wants is for you to be safe.|`|tfKFDDjmaa	My wife and I met in school under the same circumstances. I was a senior and she was a freshman. I actually had a crush on her older sister. She told me that she liked me and although I thought she was great, I still wanted a shot at her sis so I told her I liked her but only as an older brother would (although I really felt more towards her) . After a few dead-end relationships, I finally seen the light. She was the one that truly loved me. I was so blind. She has turned out to be the most wonderful person I'll ever know. I don't even deserve to have such a sweetheart. I am SO lucky that I didn't lose her.    I'm willing to bet he can or already probably does feel something more towards you. If you really want him...he needs to know it.|`|y28DO2lbaa	He feels that you are a sweet person and he just feels protective of you (and no matter how hot you are) he is not sexually/romantically attracted to you.  He is going to look out for you as if you were his family, even though you are not.|`|UQlfW4sAaa	I don't know. There is one girl in the whole world I feel brotherly about, (actually fatherly) She is my daughter in law. Any other girl better have a brass lock on those Uh-Humm Fun parts. Know what I mean?
2iDvyoXhaa	Just be open and honest about it. Don't just tell them you don't want to go to church anymore, though. You need to have well thought-out reasons and explanations. Plan what you're going to say and present yourself maturely. The last thing you need is an argument.|`|Xb2DB8TTaa	I am a mom. I want my kids go to church everySunday. But somedays my oldest one cries and say I hate this church. It is boring. It hurts me, yet I worryabout him, so I am going to First Assembly of God, where it is so upbeat and so exciting. So I pray that God will give better solution, not just quit going to church. Causeif you find the right one, it is so much fun and worth trying new church with your friends. Good luck!!|`|YrqMrVfOaa	just be honest with them and tell them the truth.. tell them you want a break and need some time off for yourself... and you really don't want to go to church anymore because it's not in line with who you are now..
64j0k4wTaa	Shut the door when you leave.. put tape on the doorknob (preferably duct tape.)  If the tape was messed with, you know there's the possibility she's in there (obviously she can't fix the tape on the outside if she's inside).    Plan   2:  If you suspect she's in your closet, figure out a way to keep her in there beyond her comfort zone (without getting weird or dangerous about it).  She'll think twice about going back in.    BTW- find out what her deal is.. why is she doing it.  Adults need to step up and demand her to be respectful of your boundaries!!!|`|AA12281884	Sex 'em up.|`|rurfFLDkaa	how old is ur sisters friend? ahha|`|89cCKrm8aa	lock the door everytime you leave your room,and keep the key in your pocket. And always look behind to see if your being followed|`|SOkhzMVDaa	get a lock on your door|`|HpMXIlLVaa	talk to your sister and simply tell her to stop or this will be reported to the parents.|`|2pfAw4Xkaa	Go buy a cheap doorknob with a lock and key. It is only about 10 bucks and super easy to install. I have one on my door because I don't like people just walking in my room. Tell your parents also. Maybe they can tell her to stop.
69671be8673ef26d8d47067de773ec6aaa	In this world, there's no 100% that a pretty woman must be together with a handsome guy.  What's wrong with average?  Doesn't mean average you can't date?  Just that the guy in your life haven't cross path with you yet.      Don't feel depressed, you will meet the one down the road of your life.  There's more meaningful things to explore when you've found your love one.    P.S. My wife is taller than me but who's care! :)|`|76nTvO4iaa	I have a daughter and two nieces in college now.    The "pretty girls" who have lots of dates are, (uh trying to put this delicately), often willing "scrabble partners" for whomever will buy them dinner, drinks or gifts.  Most of the underclassmen are trying to see how many scrabble partners they can get.     Once they get that out of their system, they'll start looking for the qualities that really matter- personality, intelligence, sense of humor,  the quality of character, decent morals and a good heart.    Stay busy with your studies, a couple of activities you enjoy and your friends (male and female).  Things will eventually turn around.  There's someone special out there for you & you'll meet him some one of these days!    ((hugs))|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	no, don't let yourself go.  just for your own self-esteem, always look your best.  i'm not so great looking either, but i'm married to a wonderful man now!  looks are NOT everything, and if that's the only thing he's going on, he's very shallow and won't make a good mate anyway.    hang in there, don't try too hard, he'll come along in the right time.|`|1hciyvKdaa	STOP right there missy! Im not your mom but you know what, you need to alter this train of thought!   Find your best feature and accent it, line those lips or pencil those brows and line those eyes, do something not normal make up wise, make yourself feel a little more special, a little liner or a little rouge goes a long way on the road to better self esteem!! Your ok, yes you can meet a wonderful man. Yes you can have a wonderful man too!|`|kHEFi3ttaa	I felt like that at one time and I'd venture to guess we're the same age too or very close....You know what every woman.. no matter how 'drop dead gorgeous' she is feels self conscious and like there is someone more pretty then she is. We all have something that makes us think that we'll never find our special someone. I'm 4'8, most men were intimidated by my height . . . uh or lack there of... and I was semi self conscious about it and never thought a man would love me never the less like me because of that. I always felt too short, too chubby, just to imperfect. So I let it go, I got comfortable with who I was and stopped noticing or caring about guys. Funny thing is my special someone loves that I'm 4ft 8in and he's 6ft2in, and loves every curve I have. Someone will love you for who you are and they'll love everything about you. Just wait and see.....  You know that song by ABBA- Take a Chance.. well that's what you have to do. Take a Chance because you never know when HE will come along.     Good Luck|`|i41tUVtIaa	OK, they might appear "prettier" but honey on the inside I bet that are just a bunch of witches.  This "pretty" girls are the ones who are constantly in and out of relationships because the men get tired of their immaturity.  Age is only skin deep, these are usually the girls who old age hits very hard.  Be proud of who you are.  There is someone out there that is made for you.  Don't get depressed.  Put all of you self into your school and do the best you can.  You have plenty of time to find a man and settle down--after college.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	i went through HS believing that i was fat and ugly (and in truth i was neither of those, i was a little bigger but in a nice way and i couldnt see it)     after four years out i lost some weight (but the big difference was (i wasnt much thinner than i had been previously) is that i started to feel better about myself)     when i stopped caring that i had never even been on a date (sure i had had a couple of flings but that was it and that was just me being desperate and allowing guys to take advantage of that) i met my fiance.    he is a wonderful man and even though i now weigh about four stone than i ever did when i though i was still heavy (way back before i lost the weight) due to various reasons including the wrong type of BC and a back injury and arthritis in my knees which stopped me from running, and he still loves me.    you have just got to stop looking because 'desperate' only attracts the wrong type of guy.    good luck|`|UldvbAIWaa	im sure your very pretty to. and everyone has someone waiting for them.|`|1jI2qMnsaa	no! you have to be skinny and have a nice butt and boobs  and you have to be hot.  thats what they all say.  they also like the preppy ones.. and cheerleaders.  like the loud ones. and the fun-to be with ones|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Nothing wrong with average.  Most of us are average.    Sit in a mall and watch people walk by.  You'll notice some unattractive people who have found mates.  You'll see some attractive people who have found mates.  Somethings the mates of an attractive person are unattractive.      Not everybody is just looking for drop dead gorgeous, first-impression physical beauty.  Beauty fades but personality doesn't.  Even some of the woman who seem to be attractive are really not all that good looking if you really look.  It's that they carry themselves well and exude confidence.    Try to turn your focus outward from yourself.  Not only will you be a better person, but you'll find that your own beauty comes from who you are, not from what you look like.    Don't get caught up in the looks game.  It's all an illusion.     You'll find your special person.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	I felt this way for a while before I met a guy that I could really settle down with. It takes a lot of patience. Me and my friend were both tired of it and we joined a dating site. In the same WEEKEND, (about say 6-8 months later) we both went out with our boyfriends of now almost 2 years, both NOT from the dating site! The dating site helped keep us entertained. It helps you feel desired, even if you don't end up dating someone seriously from it. You may like the idea or not, but looking back it worked for me. Also just try to get more social.. meeting new people of both sexes will make you feel better about yourself and may lead to meeting someone in particular.    I was so impatient and dated lots of guys over around a 3 year period and one guy basically raped me when I told him I was a virgin... my now bf lost his virginity to me but I didn't to him. I was his first kiss and he was 20! There ARE guys out there who are just waiting for the right girl (just like you're waiting for the right guy). Keep your chin up and try to entertain yourself somehow whenever you're feeling down.    Edit:  Also look for a guy who's at about the same attractiveness level as you... studies have shown that people are likely to be attracted to those at the same level. Plus you won't feel inadequate.. you will feel equal, and neither will he. Just look for someone who you find attractive and who could be your best friend.    Edit:  Oh forgot to mention that the guy who raped me ended up giving me genital warts. The one wart is gone now after I had to go in for about 5 treatments.. awkward... Plus telling my now bf about it was terribly embarrassing. Just sharing my experiences so that you see that the grass is not always greener on the other side. If I could go back I would have waited but of course I don't regret anything and my experiences have molded my identity.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes. :) I have been married for 13 years, and am very "Average", not "Drop dead gorgeous" Not "Skinny", (5'3, 200 pounds)Oh, and he's a "Quality" guy. :) He does dishes, washes clothes, can fix darn near everything, irons and is a great cook! They may be "Pretty" But I bet you they are quite "Dumb", and guys will only choose them for their looks, and therefore get less than what they bargained for when they marry them. Think about that.|`|AA10351134	In America we women tend to think that if we don't have the beestung lips, the 6" Amazon physique with a boy butt, a tiny waist and DD boobs (aka GI Joe Barbie), we have nothing. In other countries women know how to develop their own personal style, be comfortable in their own skin, appreciate the features they have.    If you can stop comparing yourself to Hollywood products, maybe take  a look at how continental European women dress and express themselves (there are lots of great blogs that cover this) you might start to enjoy those features that set you apart from the next person. Which is a very attractive quality.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Lots of good stuff here.  I'm just going to tell you what I've told my daughters.  First, you have got to love yourself before you're ready to love some one else.  Second, the most attractive women in this world are not the most beautiful or even the prettiest.  Attraction is a different animal altogether.  Third, some one who wants to use you does not love you.  If they don't put your health and well-being ahead of their 'needs', then they are not your friend.  Happy learning!|`|VpCtXEMGaa	I'm an average looking woman (in my opinion) others have told me I'm anywhere from average looking to drop dead gorgeous. It's about how you feel about yourself. Don't let your health go because you don't "feel" pretty. Personally, you can do what I did when I was ready to change my outward appearance. I hired a personal shopper, and she took me clothes shopping, helped me to find a lovely hair style that I kept for quite a while, before I started letting my hair grow out. And I loved every minute of it. It was worth the money that I spent. This might be an option for you if you have the funds.     BTW: I'm a woman in my 30's, married with children.    Edit: I did forget to mention that I am 5'8, extra large bone frame,180 lbs, size 12 in clothing (depending on the clothing manufacturer), and I wear a size 12 shoe. I have always wanted to be a small, petite, small boned woman. And I had to come to the realization that I will never be small and delicate like my mom. I am a big woman, and I am proud of it! Love yourself for who you are. You are 100% perfect! It took me many years to accept my outward appearence. I now love the body that I'm in. I ballooned to over 300 lbs. And I developed depression. I am now healthy, toned, and I think I'm sexy as hell! I hope this helps. :)    Edit: Oh one more thing. I'm married to an average looking man.|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	listen, there is someone out there for everyone.  and besides ur in college, u still have a lot of time. and dont let urself go because then ull never find anyone.  you have to have hope about finding someone.  and it isnt about just having looks, u have to be confident within urself and know that ull find someone.  pretty isnt everything, trust me|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	don't give up. quality guys are worth waiting for. trust me, even if you think you look average, a quality guy will love the way you look AND who you are inside!|`|tOLrUh0Caa	I have the most wonderful man in the world and at time I often felt just like what you have written, He came along when I wasn't looking but when I needed him the most. He sees that beauty in me that I cannot see. I believe that if in your heart if you really want a loving caring genuine guy you will be blessed with one that loves you for you and everything about you. Be patient, be positive, be you and enjoy being young! :) Best Wishes !|`|DQlZIzAFaa	stop being vain. pretty girls get laid by jerks. smart girls get guys that care about them for who they are.|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	All you need is some self confidence! I'm sure you have something pretty in you and a great personality too!|`|KOYZfaDkaa	What guy, or person for that matter, is going to want to hang out with such a downer?! No offense, but you've gotta get your act together and be more upbeat! While it's true that there needs to be some sort of initial attraction to meet guys, guys can't talk to looks, they can't bond with skinny legs either ha ha. You need to be able to have a connection about things that make you you- like politics, art, certain movies, whatever you're interested in. There's nothing wrong with dressing more presentable or wearing make up either. You don't need to change who you are or your morals to get a guy, but if you want to meet them you gotta advertise a little. Be more approachable: smile, be polite, say positive things, and hold your head high! You need to be nicer to yourself, respect yourself and you'll get the respect of everyone around you.|`|UAXHmqgRaa	There is someone out there made especially for you. God made someone for everyone. If someone looks at you for your looks only and not whats on the inside then they aren't worth having anyway. Dont worry so much about how you look you should look deep down within and think about your personality and such. You should think about what kind of person you are and who would be a better match for you, and not what you look like.  Dont you worry you will find someone.|`|x5R1zUtraa	Well, First off, Don't compare. You look at yourself every single day, and your so used to you, that your really looking at all the details. To others, people see you different, on how you see, you. They see you as a new, fresh faced person. You must be intelligent, if your in college, but once your in college, you'll meet guys who have the same interests which tend to attract couples, no matter WHAT they look like. You'll find a prince charming, just don't let yourself down, guys look for  confident women, and if your bringing yourself down, guys will sense that, and turn away. So don't bring yourself down and love you the way you should. In order to love, you must love yourself. Good Luck with Finding the Right Guy.|`|AA12050292	Dear City of Wonder,    I really wonder of this question... are you sure those guys who love those drop dead gorgeous girls are some sort of a real love?? or just a temporary emotional attachment or some infatuation?     well...lady...love does not require looks or focused on cleavages of your boobs  or its size or ONLY related with the figure and hairs or so many other bull shits... Love is a connection with soul and have much more pure things in its senses...     So pray for someone who DO NOT love shallowness of the human beauty but a real beauty...those whom you observe in your college well they are all temporary...    as far as love with a average looking women...well.. love is not based on looks, if it is then its lust!!    wish you best of luck in finding your soul mate|`|K635IdQ4aa	You will find your prince I promise..just dont expect him to be perfect...ok.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, remember that...always look your best to feel your best. Good luck|`|GHlYbDfJaa	Ok I know this is totally cliche......but true beauty really IS on the inside! It's true. I have seen girls that are literally drop dead gorgeous until they open their mouth and turn ugly right before you eyes. I have also seen "average" girls who become absolutely beautiful when you get to know them! Don't sell yourself short. A little confidence goes a long way!
97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	Try telling your husband how you feel, and hopefully also that you understand his desire to have his mother close. But, for that to happen your finances need to change first, you want to be able to help her, and do it right, so as not to cause more stress and pressure on him relating to finances. Be clear, have you bills and income to go by, and stress you want to do this, but you don't see how, does he have any ideas?
agTCqkLDaa	That he wants to be available to others.    OR    That you guys are really young and his mom/dad/guardian is his friend on facebook and doesn't know about it    OR    (and this is the one you want); he hasn't told some family members who have facebook accounts and are his friends and he would prefer to tell them in person.|`|KOYZfaDkaa	You're sure he proposed right? I'm kidding. I'd get to the bottom of this and ask him what his problem is. You need to ask why he bothered proposing if he's not ready to tell people. This sounds like an issue of maturity on his part, don't rush to the alter just yet.|`|K635IdQ4aa	Ouch, do no trust this guy..run!|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Why be with someone who wants to hide that you're engaged to him? That's disturbing. I wouldn't stay engaged. I would definitely end it with him. Why be with someone who is ashamed of you?|`|KWeU8LJtaa	Talk to him, ask why he doesn't want to make it public. If he's mature enough to ask you to marry him, he should be mature enough to not have a problem with people knowing about it. You should definitely get to the bottom of it.    Make sure he gets his issues straightened out before you marry him!|`|i41tUVtIaa	It shows that he is trying to hide that he is engaged from someone.  If he is not trying to hide it he should be proud about it.  I'd dump him and find a mature man.  If he is trying to hide something now and ya'll are not even married, what will he try to hide when he is married?
ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	I do not know what their reasons were for this but if they did not want the children or could afford to raise them then they should have protection or got their tubes tied. I know there are good families out there that want children but I see too many children on the news in foster care or that were adopted and were abused or killed at the hands of those people. Sounds like that side of the family doesn't know what responsibility is. I know I could never put my child up for adoption no matter the circumstance.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	Well, i would expect no one knows, why. But, sometimes one tends to follow in the foot steps of their role models.
2iDvyoXhaa	When I was in high school I never dated anyone from my school. I loved not seeing my boyfriend everyday because it gave me time to myself or to hang out with my friends. It also made the time that we spent together even better since we weren't able to see each other on a daily basis.    My advice to you is to enjoy time that you spend apart as much as the time you spend together. You'll have a better grip on the relationship, and it's less likely for unhealthy attachments (ie. "I'll die without him) to develop.|`|q9mFfx0Raa	well im a freshman and have been through this, the thing to make it work is that you have to talk to him everyday so it never gets old and then try and see him whenever you can.  i assume you have a car, meet him half way.  you both have to put effort in for it to work and i'm pretty sure you can.  you just have to talk to each other and make sure you guys see each other more than once a week...  maybe 2-3 atleast.
SNKVKZyCaa	This is a cool thing, it keeps your friends out of your business. You both can still talk on the phone, text and make dates to spend time together on the weekends. Besides, you might get tired of seeing him or her everyday, all day at school. Space is good sweetie,  you two will work things out just fine. HAVE FUN!
il7bLkSIaa	you know, I always thought my parents were the hardest working people in the world, and I always thought my mom was the best...but obviously from reading your story that is not true. My mom has dedicated her whole life for her to daughters (me and my sister). She ran away from a foreign country as well, to live in the US, without any money or understanding english...she dealt with divorce, got her ex-husband (my dad) out of debt when he went through a rough time in his life, even though she didn't have to. She bought my a nice car from months of saving, and she drives a horrrrriibbbbbleee old car.     My dad, greatest man alive, worked harder than anyone ive ever met. Was an electrician, woke up at 7 a.m. to go to work, came home at 9 p.m...6 to 7 days a week, even on his birthday or holidays. He had a rare spine disorder causing him to be hunch backed, a badly broken hip that never healed properly..causing him to permanently limp, arthritis in his knee which hurt him to walk everyday, and at 63 years old he still pushed himself to the max and worked his asssss off. Unfortunately his over working to provide for his family ended tragically because on Jan 10 of this year he got electrocuted, fell off a ladder, broke everything in his body basically, and had his organs burned to death by the electricity stuck inside of him after fighting in the hospital for 30 hours.    This is a true story by the way, even though I may not seem sad, I am absolutely devastated. He was my best friend, my life, my moms best friend, the most caring helpful man in the world, and 3 weeks ago today he was still alive, smiling, and well.       Anyway, what I want to tell you is that A LOT of people have a difficult rough life. A LOT of kids have hard working parents, who are immigrants, who have to fight for a decent living, or education, and to provide for their families. My mom drives on the freeway nearly 3 hours everyday for a small amount of money, just so that she can provide for my sister and I. My dad worked yearss and an electrician and just lost his life...all so that he can provide for his family. So ya, I sympathize for your mom, but just know that A LOT of parents are going through the same, if not worse, thing that your mom is going through.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	she has not overcome the trauma of divorce...she still feels the pain inside....its very tough for your mother...  it sounds good on ur part to be so understanding for your mother..well i think you should go out with her every weekend and have fun.  try to engage her in social interactions  only you can help her to be happy..think of some ways to improve her social life.  you are mature to ur age...and u seem to be one of the best daughters.thumbs up for you    and ya u do study hard so that her hard work bears fruit|`|2pfAw4Xkaa	I am in the same boat as you. My mom works two jobs and is tired and drained all of the time. I can't do much to help her. I work part-time and contribute some money to the household bills. While my mother doesn't do much but go to work and sleep or watch t.v. when she isn't, I know that she takes pride in me going to school. (I am in college by the way). She wants a better future for me and even though I would like to get a full time job and help her I know that my going to school and succeeding is all of the happiness she needs.  My advice to you is to just be there for your mother. Do well in school and make her proud. Maybe she is just content with having a loving daughter by her side. Perhaps she doesn't need the friends and the going out. Maybe you can just go out with her. Plan a mother daughter day once a week. Go to the movies and do some shopping together. She might not her a LV bag out of it but she will enjoy it all the same. She loves you so much and just having you is enough for her. Unless you can find her a nice man there isn't much more you can do at the age of 13. Good luck with your situation. I wish you and your mother all the best.|`|AaEGPYi2aa	well. first ask your siblings(if u have some) and tell them in secret about what you wanna do and what your mom is going thru. when mom goes to work clean and make home pretty nice. ask her friends to come over and give her a suprise.|`|47P7uLV6aa	Your mothe|`|AA10757358	No one can make anyone be happy.  Being happy is a state of mind which you choose to have or choose not to.  Remember the story of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs the song they sang "Whistle while you work".  A person can be happy working.  Working is life for if we don't work we don't eat or have a place to live.  She could spend time with her friends on her day off from work if she wanted to.  If they would go out to dinner she would be setting down resting, or playing board or card games. She chooses to set on the couch and watch TV on her day off.   Quite worrying about her she is a grown women and is doing what she wants to do.  You are only 13 years old, you go have fun and stop worrying.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	Trust your mom, she will be ok. She works as she does, for HER reasons, and it does not sound like she wants the social life you are mentioning. However, are you helping around the house, maybe YOU could make her feel special and appreciated. Just a early rise in the morning on one of her days off, and fix a special breakfast for her, tell her you love her and appreciate all she does.  It sounds as though she loves you very much and wants the best for you, and you know it. Right now, she is focused on you and what she feels she needs to do for you, Mother's are like that.  Just, sitting with her for a few and watching a program with her, or fixing a Special cup of tea or coffee and bringing it to her i am sure would mean so much. Try it...
pwSKT2Aeaa	listen, this guy is a total asshole.  leave him, im sure u can do wayyy better, guys like him arnt worth it.  my gf used to think the same with some oother gguy, but she realized he was a total jerk.  there are other guys in the world, and u will find some1 else.  leave him, say ur ending things with him and dont care about him|`|yijqEUyraa	go to a bookstore get "He's just not into you" or if reading not yer thing go see the movie (but I don't think you'll get the same point)  Bottom line; he cheated, he'll do it again...

AA10604300	forget the outer side of your being,    get rid of all sinister plans and thoughts,    turn to the Lord Jesus and ask him to save you and to teach you what kind, do you hear me?, kind,   and yet I say it again,  what kind of man you aught to be.    Not a sappy little nicey wicey spineless guy, but a man of inner strength, that   shines.    Women do not see brave men,   we just see the foul mouthed,   sleaze,   that jumps around with partners, as if it was a barn dance.    Now also men do not see beautiful women either,   they just see,  floozy tramps,    a nice girl is rare, but,  and a beautiful wife is from the Lord.      one good turn deserves another, savvy ?

NJrsrT12aa	Find out if she loves you in that way, if not try to get over her because long distance relationships won't work unless you're both truly in love with each other to where you guys want to travel an hour and thirty minutes to see each other.    it can't be a one way street, so if she doesn't return the love then there's really nothing else you can do.|`|NdOwsxsqaa	i think you should talk to her about seeing other ppl...|`|wXVzRXxFaa	isnt kinda freaky how you know how long it is from your house to hers?    anyway, to figure out if she likes you, lookl for the usual signals. flirting, quickly glancing at you and then smiling and looking away, you know, the usual stuff.     good luck!|`|0VUfquYTaa	watch dateline.|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	just tell her you love her and see how it goes, u got nothing to lose.  if she doesnt, she lives far away, so it wont hurt|`|OMs8tKlJaa	figure out if she lieks you the way you like her before you do some drastic things, annd maybe get a vespa to compensate for the gas milage|`|mGPZ69pLaa	what you should do is talk to her  and really try to find out wut are her true feelings  that she has for you...  juss find out and if u like wut she says   well try to work something out....  if ur old enough and have a car u can go c  her and take her out and spend time with her  somewhere else and make it romantic|`|284a098cb048bb47e3d5b1d7bd352c44aa	HEy i have thats same issue and if she liked u before she would still have to like u now...and if she doesnt be there for her so she can see the real u and then she might start liking u that way......or call her and tell her how much u miss her and then she'll see how much u care 'bout her...

feedTbEvaa	Let me get this straight...you're under 18, still in high school, and HE WAS EXPECTING YOU to pay rent! Either you're making this up, or you're incredibly naive and sheltered from the legalities of parenting.You could very easily get him into serious trouble.You're a minor, and the legal dependent of him.If he makes you pay rent while you're a minor still in school, AND kicks you out of the house with no where to go...then that's a very easy case for child neglect or abandonment.Please get some courage, quit being so ignorant about the laws, and report all of this to authorities ASAP.Your mother is responsible as well for your care.Don't just sit around and accept this.You need to grow up and grow up fast,and not be intimidated by him any more.|`|zY64xc6xaa	Report your dad to the authorities.  This is called child abandonment.|`|g7mD94cuaa	that's illegal. trust me you have many rights.|`|89cCKrm8aa	your parents arent allowed to kick you out, its against the law. If one of your friends has a baby brother of sister ask to live with them and in return you babsit the baby|`|HpMXIlLVaa	You can report this to the police, get counseling, and see how this goes with your parents.  Because something is missing here.  You should be in one of your parent's home with no rental cuz you are a minor.      As for jobs its bad economy.  Stick with your school work.  If you need to work on weekends try.  But dont overdue it.  Save your money for nearby colleges, 2 yr. til you have the money.  see how it goes|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hi RH!A.  Besides the obvious fact that everyone here has pointed out, getting your father into trouble for abandoning a minor, you might want to try to do a few things on your own that can save you from dealing with your less than stellar parents.      Job Corp is my recommendation.  At 17 you're still within the age limits for joining their organization.  From my knowledge of the program here in San Diego, they give you a place to live, training, and a job.  Look them up in your town and find out what they have to offer.     Also in my area we have an organization called St. Vincent de Paul.  Father Joe Carroll has built a small empire here for the homeless, where there are long term programs that will help you with a place to live and the resources to find a job.  Beside having a place to live they provide meals, case management, counseling and many other things to help you succeed.  Find out what the equivalent of that might be in your area.      You need to find a place where you not only have room and board and a chance to find a job and/or career, but where you can find supportive and caring people to assist you.  It seems your parents have fallen far short of that.      Good luck to you.|`|SOkhzMVDaa	omg i am so sorry your parents kicked you out!! It is illegal for your parents to kick you out and you need to get someone to help you, The only way they could kick you out is if you are 18 or legally emancipated. you need to tell your parents that it is there responsibility to take care of you until your are 18 and in the meantime get a part time job and start to save up! tell them that you will take legall action there are some attornys that you can get for free if they get paid only if you win or you can get a D.A. but please take some legal action and im very sorry they kicked you out im 16 and if my parents kicked me out i would not know what to do my life would be ruined no home! do you have any grandparents to live with?|`|ViKERS0Taa	Ya heres the deal.  You can run away for 12 hours max. after that your dad can call the cops on you.  He can kick you out for 12 hours max.  If he wont let you back in after 12 hours you can call the cops on his ***.  I wish I was that lucky. My dad's a dick but he wont kick me out.|`|9uIL3uYKaa	These are obviously Rednecks we are dealing with. The rejects of out White Culture. Call the Police they deserve it anyway. You can go to a Foster home after that.|`|VYEJXGutaa	go to your local youth center or student funding office. Are you in canada? cause here they will pay for your rent and living expenses while you finish high school and then you can take a student loan for college and live in the dorms.
aujHVGFiaa	You are not your father's keeper. You can't live for your unstable mom either. It doesn't mean you don't love them. You have to be strong and  confident. Good luck!|`|SOkhzMVDaa	you need to tell your bf that you are moving out and concentrating on school and that you need a more acedemic environment and hopefully he will understand|`|HpMXIlLVaa	What is the hurry??  Wait til you have finish at least one year of college.  Your boyfriend should still be around if he is waiting for you.  You have a long life ahead.  Then break it to them.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	You have been with the guy for 5 years. He is not stranger and you are an adult. You have the choice of moving out and you just need to tell them that you are adult enough to make this decision to move and you are ready. They can get mad, or upset, but you are an adult.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Maybe tell them you're moving out but arrange to have dinner there two nights a week or one night at your house? It is an event that parents should be prepared for when you are around 18 years old or whatever age is right for you... but to ease the transition reassure them that you will visit frequently?|`|x59uoIpMaa	Dont move out with your boyfriend. Do it on your own. Trust me, it is better this way!!      Pray about it. Either way your parents are gonna find out about you moving out. If your mom is bipolar she'll flip either way.  So do what's right, wait til your married to live with your boyfriend, and tell your folks you are moving out to get your own place.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	If you're mature enough to move out & handle adult responsibility, you should be mature enough to approach your parents w/ out asking Yahoo Answers. *a~hem*|`|wq1MheO7aa	well, how do you communicate the best with her? Just don't drop the bomb on her early or wait till last minute. Tell her in advance and give reasons why it would be good. If at first it doesn't go well promise to visit ever so often to satisfy her.
rPN4E9ryaa	friendships sometimes burn out....we have friends because they have something to offer us, like valid advice or entertaining company, or neat perspectives on things....we also offer our friends the same things....if neither of you are benefitting from the friendship, end it....it happens all the time|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	It is normal. Things are probably just dull in your lives. Try doing something exciting together, something that would definately make for a memory. Something worth talking about. Good luck. :)
b7d61d00819e6e79d7e6b03b1e9bfa32aa	For my wedding we went to dollar tree and bought swans, believe there were 12 in a pkg for $1, we filled the swans with gummi bears (he likes gummi bears), and m & m's (I like m & m's) and then we took ribbon and a little card that had a bell and our names and dates in it and tied mesh around them with the ribbon. Guests LOVED them and they were personalized because many of our guests knew the candy were our favorites|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I am making melting moments biscuits with lemon icing which are absolutely delicious (our colour is yellow and they are yellow). They take about 5 minutes to make, 10 minutes to bake and about 1 to put together. http://www.exclusivelyfood.com.au/2008/0...  We are putting them in a clear box and tieing with black robbon.  Total cost comes to AU$150 (US$100) for 100 guests. That is the maximum. The biscuits themselves are about $40, its the way we are packaging them that is costing the most.|`|i41tUVtIaa	I had two hershey's kisses wrapped in the veil material?? mesh stuff (I can't remember what it is called!!!)  with a small bow with a little note thanking them for attending the wedding and helping make this day memorable for the bride and groom.|`|tBODwcqXaa	It really depends on your wedding. I am a big fan of useful wedding favors. I just wrote an article about this at http://somethingbluebook.com/01/sample/. There you'll find some cute ideas!|`|K635IdQ4aa	cute frames with both in your picture, and then it can be reused by their pics|`|JrVhTyLdaa	Give your guests something unexpected instead of same old favors they see at every wedding they attend. Find several unique wedding favor ideas at    http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/U...|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	With the current trend of "going green", give seed favors.    You can buy bulk flower seed and glassine envelopes off EBay. You can get the seed (buy perennial flower seed, it comes back year after year) for under $20.00. Glassine envelopes come in many sizes but you can get probably as many as 200 for under $20.00 with shipping.  Print a little "Thank You for making Our Day Special" kind of card from perforated 4X6 card stock in your wedding colors (there are 4 cards to a page). Put some seed in the glassine envelope, seal it up, put the card on top punch a hole in an upper corner or center top thread ribbon through it and tie a bow! Wella! you have an inexpensive gift that keeps on giving and is good for the environment!
HWyhc5rdaa	He wants attention and feels like no one cares at the moment.  Tell his mom and dad....,  Or your school or church shrink.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	I have gone through the EXACT same scenario, and now he's my boyfriend of 2 months. I would advise you to do as I did, which is this: I would call him and talk to him, even if it was just small talk. He had a lot to say, and nobody to listen. I was simply there for him, constantly reminding him that there are people on this earth whom care very deeply for him. One of them being me. Just remind him constantly that you care, and maybe even let him know how you feel for him. Love is a sure way to save someones life. Do whatever you can to save him, even if it means telling somebody. If you don't tell someone, and it becomes too late to do so, you'll probably hold it against yourself for a very long time. Good luck... I know how difficult this situation is...|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Well he sounds very young, like jr high age. Tell a teacher or principal.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	Ask him to hang out over the weekend. Tell his friends so they can make plans with him too. Don't let him drink or do any drugs as this can heighten his feelings of suicide. See how he feels after the weekend. If you feel like he is doing worse or doesn't want to make plans over the weekend, tell an adult who can handle the situation.|`|UQlfW4sAaa	Why don't you try giving him some. I mean if you don't have a bf. It may not be your first choice but if it will save his life, what the heck? Maybe it will help him see that no woman is worth ending his life over.|`|nyeUUojFaa	get help for him, like a counsellor or soemthing.|`|pW5pGNTZaa	I truly believe that he won't, if he was really that depressed and wanted to end it, he would have just done it, not tried to be an attention seeking moron.    He sounds like an idiot that needs to grow up ans realise not everything is going to go his way.    @ lalala, yeah ok, i have no idea who this guy is and he might actually be that depressed, But from what i've read thats not the way he's coming across.     For starters, where only told that he wrote cut here on his wrist, which means if he didn't actually cut his wrists he just wants attention, otherwise why would he write on his arm if he wasn't going to show anyone?|`|d3c0ee5195310afe530c7acc73e0e45daa	Matt, don't asume this guy is an attention seeking moron. Some people really do suffer from depression, and can be a bit emotional. It's not their fault.   I think you should try talking to him, and if he seems completely serious, you should talk to your parents, or the school counsler or an adult you trust to help. They're really the best people to help.

AA12316174	No they are protected by the law! YOur parents have no rights top know anything pertaining to your sexual health|`|Ce3xqNjdaa	nopeee|`|PYexFeq8aa	You could sue her for damages if she did that as well as have her fired. Yes it is confidential and no, she's not allowed to tell. Not all people stick to the rules though and that's a chance you'll have to take.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	I'm sure they can't tell them. Confidentiality is VERY important and they protect other people's privacy. They cannot break what they say.  When I was going it was confidential.(going to get on birth control)  And they will not call you at home if you do not want your parents to know.  They  say it is, but if they go against it, they are risking getting into trouble.

2pfAw4Xkaa	Don't give her anything to complain about. Keep your room clean and do not use her stuff. Live there, eat there, and sleep there. When she asks you something answer it respectivly and move on. If she tries to pick a fight with you say okay mom you are right and walk away. It is better to just let her win the arguments. Even if she is dead wrong keep it to yourself. I am not saying that you have to be her slave but you stated that you don't want to take lawful action against her so this is best thing you can do. Ignore her live your life and try to interact with her as least as possible. I feel sorry for you and I hope that things work out for you. If you believe in anything then pray about it. Good luck.|`|Bt3857hxaa	Sweetie you need to get out of the house and go to a place where they can help you and also help your mother.     I don't know the number but I know a number you can call....

Or look it up in the phone book. Should be right in the front page of it. ...Call them right now.  If your scared to call or not sure what to say. Then run down to a police officer or to anyone that may help you. Have them call the place for you and they can talk to them.   If your under 18. They can have someone come and get you in a sec.

Although she is bipolar the pain still remains the same. I pray that things get better for you on your end.     Just try and remember always that she does love you.|`|47P7uLV6aa	Honey, you DO need counseling.  Not that there is really anything wrong with you, but counseling will help you understand that your mother is sick.  You NEED to talk to someone who can help you, a guidance counselor at school or a trusted family member or a friend's parent -- someone.  Living this way is too much for a 16 year old to handle.  Besides -- if YOU get help then perhaps your mother can get help too.  She definitely needs it.      Your mother sounds narcissistic -- look it up.  It's one of the MOST damaging personality disorders to live with.  But with help you can survive your mother and go on to have a good life.      Please get help.  You don't have to go through this alone.|`|wQiVfIciaa	No. Your mother does not treat you right. My mom and I get into fights a lot and she has never said I hate you. The worst thing she ever did was slap me. And then she started crying. I am so so sorry for what you are going through. And I thought my life was bad...    I know you don't want to call the police but if she hits you hard enough to leave a mark that's... that's well, child abuse. You should seriously think about this:    "Would I give my life for her?"    If you answered no then you need to either contact one of those child abuse rescue centers or tell someone.    If yes... then go to counseling. Im not wanting you to go about the whole "cutter" thing... (the past is the past.) I want you to go because of your mom. No offense but there is something wrong with her. You can tell the counselor not to tell your mom and they won't. They will help you.     Please listen to what I am saying.    I'm sorry... for you.    Be happy.    ; )

Shag time..|`|rKsgGHKkaa	since when is anybody normal these days?!  if u guys want to just do it u dnt need to come on here and ask if its normal or not.|`|9Y9BBB99aa	plenty of couples do it, ud be surprised|`|c68XWGltaa	two finger mexican oil change|`|d781eClkaa	First of all, in regards to sex, "normal" is a false standard. There is no such thing as normal. Everyone is different. By society's norms, viewing pornography is vile and horrible. But if you're truly curious and he's just as curious as you are, why not? As long as it's not illegal, I don't see what the big deal is.|`|N19mmDELaa	yea. its normal.  my boyfriend and i do it all the time :)|`|EZKe92TTaa	Anything is normal as long as you're both consenting adults. If you're both curious you may find it exciting and stimulating or not at all.|`|KPJ8uFuUaa	There is a lot of movie info on http://thehotmovies.net :)|`|sGvYC3AQaa	DAMN HE IS LUCKY!!!|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	well couples usually do that right b4 they about to have sex|`|c2acd854cd418a5552122e2825d38babaa	it's ok|`|RiHiOCANaa	Yes very normal.

BUT,    if you are a christian, you should refrain from watching those kinds of films.|`|vJwl2uoBaa	It is average, not normal.  I have done it and I feel degraded.|`|AB8nUS3uaa	yeahh.. you should act out what they are doing as well.. as long as you are up for it|`|Oq4ShXTyaa	ya, alot of people do it, its perfectly normal especially if you want to get some fresh ideas for when your "in the sack" its perfectly healthy, it doesnt mean you're bored with each other but your trying to spice things up|`|6OVDBiCnaa	really r u serious?  how old r u  thats the best way to get horny and to turn each other on    n yes it is completely normal if ur uncomfortable then ur not ready to do any of that|`|gKa5rdNYaa	My wife and I watch them here and there whether its to learn or just for a good laugh! Its just a sense of being comfortable with one another! Lots of couples around the world watch them! So in that sense i dont see anything abnormal about it at all!|`|yijqEUyraa	I say yes. Not only will you be able to see what he might be "into" but you might enjoy it as well. Now if you feel threatened by the actors or the actions being performed then tell your boyfriend how you feel. If he loves you he'll respect your choice. Also if it becomes an everytime thing, try without it and if it can't or doesn't happen. Whoever "needs" it to perform has deeper issues and you should run screaming, unless it's you... Then seek help. But this is only if it becomes a problem or issue in your relationship.|`|RtApoLxTaa	girl yes it is normal, me and my boyfriend watch adult films . all it does for us is make us have sex. we never finish the movie. so yeah it ok to watch it . y'all might learn some moves.
ggfE4rlvaa	If she didn't tell you then maybe she feels like she's doing something wrong considering he has a girlfriend. She went over-the-line with it if you ask me. You guys are only 15, love shouldn't even be in your vocabulary, it was for me..and I ended up with a baby long before I was ready. She needs to respect his relationship and the boundaries that he has a girlfriend. How would she feel if some girl was telling her bf that she loved him? She'd probably be pretty PO'd! I think as her friend, you do have the right to be mad that she didn't think it through..she does something stupid like that and it does reflect on you, guilt by association unfortunately. It's not cool hearing something liek that from the guy and not your friend, I'd be mad too. You can just drop it though on the same hand, it's not a big deal and she's setting herself up to get hurt, or even assaulted if the guys gf is crazy enough..Best of luck!|`|H6xslmyvaa	In my point of view, 15 is a bit too young for love. But that's not what matters right now.    You have a right to be a bit annoyed, but don't let this minor problem ruin your relationship. It's alright for her to tell the guy that she loves him without telling you first--she might be embarrassed, or maybe she wants everything to work out between them before telling you. I think you should tell her straight out that you felt mad that she didn't tell you beforehand, but also tell her that you would be supportive if she told you. :)

cYf5IacRaa	Ohmigod, that's horrible. Well, if you didn't have any luck with the police station and your father is physically abusing you, then you could try child protective services. You can get their number by calling 411 and asking for the one in your city. If that doesn't work, then wait out the night and call the police for help in the morning. Anyway, best of luck! I really hope everything works out for you! :)|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Call your local church, and ask for the pastor.  Like a Non-denomational, or Baptist, or maybe your own it your family goes.

r1IWKjFxaa	I'm sorry, but a very similar thing happened to me.  Odds are you're her security blanket.  Around just enough so that she knows she's loved in a way, but she will put you away the second she finds anyone else.  Sometimes the only thing to do is let the relationship fade.|`|a2tptFbqaa	If you feel your being taken for granted, chances are you are.  I would let her know how you feel. You don't have to be angry or ugly about it. Simply tell her that you value her as a friend, but don't feel that she reciprocates. If she really is your friend, she'll do something about it. If she is using you, you'll find out and be able to end it and move on.|`|ksUksniqaa	It's time to move on.  She sounds like a user, and no matter how much you do for them, you cannot buy their love (in any form).    Someone else has come to be her "hero" now.  You are lucky to be rid of her.   t|`|AA12399056	love can't be bought, if she's not for real, walk out. there are good people out there, i mean honest.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Sometimes it is hard to be around someone so perfect like you. No real problems. School dorm money all paid by daddy.  You look at me cuz i hooked up with wrong guy again and got kicked out.
jqhvxWzGaa	i have friends who got married in a courthouse.  it was awful and ugly.  i mean, the court people were nice and everything, but it's a courthouse! there was a bunch of creepy parolees checking us out - ew.    you can get married anywhere by a minister. they're not expensive and you can even get one non-denominational or secular. you can even have a friend do it for free. just get married at the place where the reception is. don't invite the jailbirds and drinky traffic school crowd.|`|i41tUVtIaa	The only  bad thing is most courthouses don't have enough goom for that many people.  You usually get married in an office.  Why don't you, the groom and ya'lls immediate family go to the courthouse.  You have a nice dress (sunday dress) and they dress up you have a boquet, a photographer, exchanging of rings.  After the "ceremony" invite everyone to a reception or somewhere to eat.  This is what my sister did.  The office she got married in was about the size of a small McDonald's dining area that would be wat too small for that many people.  Her wedding cost under 150 bucks, my mom and I made the boquet and we all got new sunday dresses and the men got new shirts and ties (there was only about 12 family members there).  You could save you money for a killer reception somewhere else and just set a time to show up  Don't tell people what time you are getting married that day.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	It depends on the courthouse, your best bet is to ask at the courthouse what happens during a wedding there. I considered it myself- I have two courthouse options in my area. One of the options is in the new building where you can have up to ten guests in a pretty sitting room type enviroment it takes about fifteen minutes. the other option is at the old courthouse which is a heritage listed building and very popular for functions(it's an absolutely stunning sandstone building with gold leaf everywhere on the inside) and that is much more like a traditional chapel wedding although they don't allow more than thirty guests and is very expensive. My garden wedding that I've planned is a much cheaper option for me!|`|2PDBxlYDaa	My mom and stepdad got married in a courthouse. I wouldn't do it if it were me. I'd have a small wedding elsewhere. Basically you go to court and its just the couple and the judge, there might be a court reporter helping the judge. Its over and done with in a matter of minutes. Nothing romantic about the whole thing.    Their marriage didn't last because of other reasons, and now my mom has met a really nice guy in her 50s and he's wonderful. I think they might get married so I'm happy for them. I just hope they do something nicer than a courthouse wedding. I don't think you need a lot of money to get married. Even 10k is too much to spend on a wedding.    I think you can have a romantic, inexpensive wedding and still keep it small. I don't think you have to go in debt for one day. But yea imo getting married at a courthouse is really um, very spartan.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	I was married in a courthouse years ago and I wish that I had not done that. It just didn't seem right. Although you do not wish to spend alot of money on a wedding, you could still get married in a church and it not cost much. If you or a family member is a regular member of a church, ask the pastor how much he would charge just for you to have a simple ceremony at the altar. Then after the ceremony you could go somewhere with your guests and have a nice dinner. At the courthouse their isn't much room for that many guests. Good luck!|`|VpCtXEMGaa	I was married in the court house the first time around. Personally, I wouldn't do it again. I had a very small wedding that cost less then $1,000. I would rather spend more money on a more memorable day, versus getting married in the court house.     Good luck.|`|TpdvK4Wxaa	My husband and I got married in a courthouse in March of 2007.  It cost us thirty dollars for the actual wedding.  Everything else we just simplified, he wore a suit and I a casual dress.  We didn't want anything commercial either.  We didn't have family there, unfortunately, but they would've fit okay had that been possible.  I'd say dressing conservative but still elegant, after all, it is your wedding.  The ceremony took a whole five minutes, if that.  Honestly, it was an occasion where you're just too excited and happy to really remember after awhile.  I wish we had had somebody to video record it if nothing else...nah, it would've shown my husband tearing up, that would've hurt his machoness.  Hope this helps you decide.  But I'm with you all the way!  The economy is too tough for people to be paying so much on top of the commercialization of it.  It's your day to show him you love him and that money doesn't have anything to do with it, and vice versa.|`|66ebcba85f2a6120fbb7b58bdb7a909eaa	here in town...the judges have even decorated the courtrooms.  the bride has worn a real wedding dress, and there were flowers.  most judges are anxious to please .   if your heart is set on this sort of wedding,please contact the judge ahead of time.  good luck~~~~

I like it very much if she comes up and delivers a big sloppy, slimy kiss and it is rubbed all over my lips and face--as then we have really shared the experience.  I will add a suggestion.  It is good to have a small towel nearby that can be warmed with warm water and she then uses it to wipe him off (down there and his face) afterward. He can do the same where she needs to be wiped as well....alll this addes to the sharing and mutual respect.  AND sometimes it is so pleasurable, both will want to do it again....and he will become ready....especially if she adds some ice to her lips the second time.

Cuando te pregunten: "?Cómo estás?",    no respondas simplemente "Bien".  Responde: "Muy bien", o <br>  "Entre muy bien y Excelente".  Tú te sentirás también muy optimista, y si lo vuelves un hábito, todo te saldrá bien.

If she is not accepting you as his wife then she is a bad person and you shouldn't accept her as your mother in law! You married her son, not her.

He screwed up in thinking that you have a lot of time  and that you have no friends or whatever. Just give it some time.|`|3af562b4494cb991c32676aab41095e8aa	He obviously doesn't respect you if thats how he treats you. Also, if he can't understand your sacrifices to be with him ie. no friends- then he definately isn't worth your time. 'His space' will seem very lonely after awhile and he will come back.

Have you heard the old saying if you love something set it free if it doesnt come back it was never meant to be.  It's true.  Give him the space that he thinks he needs.  You do what you have to do to get through school and be able to support yourself.  You can't let anything stand in your way.  Good Luck!|`|AA11264713	Personally he does feel crowded. I understand that you work full time and go to school but you want to spend all your free time with him and in his perception it makes you needy. <br>  <br>  Get a couple friends and spend a night a week with them and than one night a week with him. Eventually you will be done with school and than where will that leave you? No friends and a boyfriend who is running the other way. You'll be more desirable to him if you seem more unavailable. Even after three years guys still like the chase.|`|9ffabc9fb8b6a6ebc2f80191440fe161aa	just ignore him and after awhile he'll miss you enough all he will want to do is spend QUALITY time with you

AA11663922	I had almost the same problem with my best friend (who is in fact the opposite sex from me, and I have a crush on him). I was making all the efforts in the relationship and I felt like his bond wasn't as deep as mine. And it was true. So you know what I did? I stopped trying. And guess what happened: He started trying. Now my feelings are just as important to him as his feelings are to me. He really does care about me now. Not completely in the way that I would like, but we really are best friends now. I would have to say the same thing to you. Stop trying! If she likes you, she'll start trying. If not, she is not worth it, dude. Hope that helps!|`|1480f49e6f1b6a313da1565d07988bf4aa	you have to change and do not ask for more. be casual do not think much like you are now. everything will be normal if you control yourself. you love her but dont expect much than that is happening now. most of the problems come only with expectations. take it easy and everything is going to be ok. keep yourself busy and try to meet her weekly once or twice. she will observe the change and she will feel like meeting you more. simple thing is make her ask you to come out by restricting yourself and keeping yourself more busy. all the best|`|2fe696caf941944a65c70074cd337c75aa	hmm...yes very confusing actually.  I think though that you have to really take a step back, that's the only way you'll know if she really likes YOU or just likes the attention she's getting.  I know it's hard, but give her the space so you can both figure out if you really like each other.  Do stuff you like to do with your friends, keep busy and don't call her for two days, see what happens.  Good luck!|`|AA11982072	MAYBE SHE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU BUT DOESN'T WANT YOU TO GET TIRED OF SEEING HER EVERYDAY. MAYBE SHE WANTS TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP FEELING GOOD AND NOT BORING.

You need to set down with her and you both need to decide what you both want out of your relationship. Did you ever think she might be seeing someone else, I'm not saying she is but it may be a possibility? Like I said before you need to tell her how you really feel and what you both want out of your relationship!|`|f23123a78f85512dc7f0c828923d32b0aa	well maybe you should just talk to her about it you know. thats the only way your gonna solve the problem. or maybe shes still thinking of you as a friend. if shes really a good friend she wouldnt hate you for trying to tell her how you feel.|`|f7a3d387be28ec1009b490173c12747baa	well, she may be in the stage where she is afraid to ask because she is afraid that what she wants to do isnt something that you would like to do....... try asking her to pick a day for you to hang out, and let her decide what you guys are going to do...... (even if you think what she wants to do is cheesy or you dont want to do it DO IT ANYWAYS) if you truly love her than it wont matter what you do, you'll have fun doing it.....<br>  she probably doesnt ask you to go shopping because she feels you wont enjoy it....|`|AA10026791	dump her ***<br>  <br>  how old are you?<br>  <br>  sounds like you're in a middle school relationship, dude.|`|2275b42b51f8133295f7a6cff12afcd4aa	Well well well..Some girls likes independant guys while some likes initiative guys...i guess your gal likes independant guys..Don't ask her out!! Play her game! She will feel weird after a few days and will ask you whats wrong with you and if you want to go out with her..then you told her that you were about to ask her..just afriad that she's busy...never tell her you are busy..if not she will wait for you to ask her out next time..As she will keep thinking you didn't call her cause you are busy...
AA10690370	I love Rebecca, I guess you really do love her, snooping around.<br>  <br>  Supposing she had experienced sexual abuse, there's not much you can do.  Her message sounds as if she wants to keep it under wraps for now, so respect her privacy and say nothing about it until she's ready to share that part of her story with you.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, she may be using that abuse to her advantage to get through to these band guys, to get them to feel sympathy for her and get in touch with her.  Who in the world will not feel sorry for someone who's been abused? <br>  <br>  Anyway, if I were you, I would keep my mouth closed, act dumb and simply observe the way she behaves.  She sounds like a manipulator.|`|0f25ce8d2eff3f850fd125f29c2f3388aa	bring it up with her, try to do it gently and express your concern, even if she doesnt let you in right away thats fine drop it, just knowing that you really are concerend for her will probly make her feel better if not talk to you about it later after shes past the initial shock of you knowing. Also you may wanna talk to a counseler about this approach as im only going off of my best thoughts on what to do and i wouldnt want to see this turn into an even worse situation because i was wrong, besides a counselor would be able to help her as well if she agreed to go but from the sounds of it shell probly need a friend like you first<br>  <br>  Good luck, and God bless|`|AA10285199	Dude...sexual abuse...thats like the worse thing that could have ever happened to her.... ask her about it and if she asks tell her that blunder she made but also tell her that you care deeply about her enough in fact to make you loose sleep since you read that message.|`|15bd76a03d80318b174c0f63bb2e988daa	Have you questioned her about it?  This could be serious.  She may have been abused when she was younger, and wants a way to express it.  If someone writes a song about it she has a connection. I think she might need to see a councellor or someone.  She may have a lot on her mind, that strictly religious parents cannot cope with.  Give her all the love and help she needs.|`|d4827c142d641441046a4b971f63f414aa	leave her alone...|`|f51cc6bca9cc6d418a14107ea4ebd793aa	if she really trusts you she'll tell u about it if u ask

If you are not close, I don't see anything wrong with calling him Chris.  As time progresses you might get closer and feel like you want to start calling him dad, but I think the name Dad is something that needs to be earned, not just given because your mom loves him.  Dad is given to a person that loves you and takes care of you.  You know you can depend on him no matter what.  When you share those kinds of feelings for each other it is time to start calling him Dad.|`|880580eef884982eab966f5b9f0033d9aa	Call him Chris, unless you are really close with him and feel comfortable calling him dad.|`|AA11703981	Daddy Chris<br>  Pops<br>  Chris<br>  Step-Dad<br>  Or just Dad.<br>  But it's up to the children to decide if they are comfortable calling him any of those names.

The one night stand make them think that they want just much of a relationship as you.|`|AA11164562	You know why.....are you the guy that want the one-night stand?<br>  <br>  It is very simply, the guys who want the one-night stand say the very things a good man will say.  Men are not totally stupid, although sometimes I wonder about that, they know what women are in search of and they use it to their advantage to have sex with women.  And their are more men----immature men-----who would rather share their new toy than be in a real relationship with a real woman.   <br>  <br>  Then those very men talk trash about the women disparaging their character because they believed the lies.  <br>  <br>  Personally, we as women need to wake up and stop having sex with the men altogether.   If more women would stop having sex with men and stop pretending that they are like men, have sex with not emotinal bond, the men would have to step up to the plate and be men and stop being little boys with their new found toy.

15f7f83cf615b81783d0068413c57a70aa	I'm not quite sure, but at that moment it seems like she was just embarressed. Other times it is just the time of her life. We tend to get mad or annoyed at our moms sometimes even for little to no reason. Eventually it will change. I'm still kind of going through that kind of stuff with my mom. Hopefully everything will turn out okay.|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	i would suggest family therapy. also try and go some where with her just her that is not public. do something outrageous rent two 4 wheelers and go in the country or go paint balling with her do something with her she would have alot of fun even if you hate it pretend you are having so much fun. just keep in mind that feeling you had when you held her for the first time.|`|QDJe3ugGaa	She's probably embarrassed because you   had to leave and come back just for money.|`|qKle9X8laa	As a teenager girl myself, I would want a mom who is really cool and understanding. I think that applies for your daughter as well. You have to put yourself in her shoes and you have to show her that you understand her. When you guys are in an argument, don't scream or say anything that will hurt her. Use gentle words, and tell her that you want to understand the situation from her point of view. Teenager's views about things are always different from adult's. She may be right or wrong, but you have to show her that you understand, and show her how she is wrong, or how you are wrong in a soft manner. It's the same with my mom as well. She doesn't understand it from my point of view. But since I told her that, she is really open minded, and we get along great! Wish you all the best :)|`|ZAOzJAwwaa	i am exactly like that! i dont know y i do it but i just have anger jolts it is sooooooo weird some times i just wish my mum would give me a hug and say its o.k. my baby i love you......have a mummy daughter day, i think she and i are are having hormonal changes where the dail outburst is essential I can honestly tell you that i have no idea y either of us do it don't worry bout it and give her occasiounal hugs and kisses and play games with her if she gets mad just smile and give her a cuddle and ask her if she needs anything at all or if she is sad about something its good to know your parents aren't angry at you when they know the truth....|`|FUQtpQByaa	i agree with tara

You can actually wear it again unlike most bridesmaid dresses.|`|6DiknmIxaa	I like the dress. It's not that formal so you can always wear it again.

Believe me hun I've seen MUCH worse lol.|`|jqhvxWzGaa	it's very ... berry. lol. no, you probably won't ever wear it again. i've seen worse at higher prices. it's not great, but you'll look great in it. work it, girl!|`|T3TDOoGPaa	yeah it looks cool.actually super.it is just the one for marriage.good luck|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	it is quite lovely|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Love it. beautiful dress.|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	I like it.

The price is good too.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I wish I got to wear a dress like that as a bridesmaid! It's cute, comfortable and you could wear it again if you needed to. It has straps, you can wear a normal bra and underwear, it's a color that's actually pretty - that dress has a lot going for it!    Good luck!|`|skI1Hg21aa	i dont think its that bad- i was in a wedding last year and ours was a lot worse,,, dont worry its just for one day|`|1beae6c60e6736b0ee9c6d29bc59b1abaa	I like it.  Its easy to dress up or change the look and you will be able to get lots of wear out of it.|`|MztgUa0raa	It's the type of style that will fit most body types, unless you have a very buxom brides maid who is modest.    It is the type of dress that one could wear again depending on the color.  A dark color can be worn as a party dress, etc.  But a pastel color (which is likely for a wedding) is much less likely to be worn again.

This is not seen as a desperation move by a guy, it is rather cool actually.
MzqZGvalaa	No. If you're going to stay with your husband I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not worth the ill will that will probably ensue.  Even though you are in the right and are the victim in this situation, family is still family, you know?  Chalk it up to (an expensive and horrible) experience, and don't ever let anyone talk you into ignoring your instincts again.  On a lighter note think of the 'I told you so' leverage this gives you.  Every time he  questions your judgment in the future, look at the ammo you've got!!!   It also proved that your instincts are sound.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	talk to ur hubby about ur suspicion.involve police with his consent.if he doesnot agree,ask him to arrange all the stolen stuff from his earning|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	I would talk to my husband about it first, and that would be my deciding factor. However, if he was totally against it, i would make it very clear, NEXT time, who stays with you in your home, is all YOUR decision.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	You gave in against your better judgment to your husband and you got robbed. This happened to my mother with her step-grandchildren. Her husband let his grand kids move in with them and they stole her prescription medication to sell and take. She immediately told them to get out and never return to the house again. I know this sounds harsh but she opened her home to them, let them sleep under her roof, eat her food, use her water, etc.. you get the picture, and this is how she was treated in return. ( The reason I say her house, it was hers before she remarried and I don't like my step-dad). Anyway, I would just do the same thing to him that my mother did. I would tell him to leave and never come back to my home again. After this, how could you ever trust him in your home again? Good luck.

AA10604300	You guys need to understand one very essential element.    You cannot be the end all for him  and   He cannot be the end all for you,    YOU BOTH, need to figure out what makes for true happiness.  Else you will both destroy the relationship with higher expectations of the other partner making you happy.  This is foolish.  For you must be happy within yourselves, in order to share that same joy for each other.

AA11747856	Well if you are talking about actually going out, as in going on a date, go out with the one who asked you and if the other one ever gets back to you then go out with him too.  However, if you are under the age of 16 and are talking about "going out" as in a title for school kids who don't actually do anything besides maybe eat lunch together and talk on the phone then go with the one who asked you out, because the fact that the other didn't answer, that pretty much is his answer.|`|AA12059846	Date both, nothing wrong with that.  Then get to know both of them and decide from there.
ffc23e34ef3110fce2afb94df415f202aa	I went through basically the same thing with an uncle of mine. He still denies everything. I don't think they ever admit it. I was molested. I don't speak to most of the family on that side due to them not wanting to choose sides years ago. Also one family member actually hired him a lawyer. This was the side of the family I was closest to. It has been very painful over the years especially around the holidays when you are used to being around so many family members. I just hope you have some immediate family that is there for moral support. I've never been hypnotized. I did go to counseling. That was a joke a lot of them were not even qualified and hadn't been through it. But I wish you luck and hope you can get the s.o.b..|`|4605a51d081f13aebbce30102e875bb6aa	I advise you not to go to him. Go to a counselor and ask them. Azzholes like him need to be punished.

a2tptFbqaa	Be patient. If it's meant to be it will be... It this relationship goes sour, which it probably will, it may be the best time to let the one you love know. If you do it now, your good intentions could be misconstrude as interfering or worse. Be there for them when they break up. Let them know your care... If they are intuitive, they will read the signals. If they don't.. send gradually increasing signals, and if necessary come out and let them know how you feel.  But don't do it when they are "involved" with someone else. Good luck.|`|10QSTGWAaa	This one is always a toughie, but I can say from experience that dating your friends isn't usually a good idea.    You could ask him if he likes anyone else maybe inconspicuously, or try and hint that you like him without actually saying it. If he doesn't like you, you can play it off, but if he does, you could be getting into something special.     Just be sure that you're willing to risk your friendship on it.

180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hi John.  I think do.drop has the right idea with either Job Corps or the military.  Especially with the military, when they say come along, there's no way your folks can keep you from going.  You write as if you are an American, so I would suggest trying out for the Navy.  They are not usually called on to engage in battle on land, so your chances of actually being in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan to fight is very slim.  The Navy also offers some of the best technological training there is, so you can come away from the experience with valuable knowledge for civilian life.  Plus the service offers many benefits as far as education and housing.      I wish you good luck on your plans for getting away.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	I've dreamt of getting away from my parents my entire life. I don't like them. They have made my life harder too.  Nobody is going to help you. obviously you need to be able to financially support yourself to do this.  Until then, you may be stuck.|`|MzqZGvalaa	Join the Army!!!  Look -  you're an adult and you're not going to get that kind of help because you're not a minor.  If you don't like it at your parents house -move out.  Battered women with half a dozen kids can do it - so what's your excuse?  Do you have learning difficulties or something like that?  If so then you can get help-contact the Salvation Army near where you live.  If you don't you should be looking after yourself by this age and standing on your own two feet anyway.  I really think you should look at the Army or Navy or Air Force if you really are too insipid to manage to move by yourself, it'll teach you how to be a grown up if nothing else.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	Join the service or Job Corp..Talk to local resources or dshs.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	You can try your local social services and see if you qualify for housing assistance. If not, then you need to find a good paying job and save your money. I know its hard to save money when there are other things that you need, but my son went to work when he was 15 yrs. old and saved $6000. on his own to put down a car he wanted. If he can do it, so can you. If the situation at home is bad, then when you get a job see if you can work overtime. You will make more money working overtime, thus getting you away from home for a while. But keep in mind, to get out on your own, if you rent something, you will need to put a deposit down plus the first months rent, a deposit to turn on your power, and if you have city water a deposit on that as well. And, you might have to put a deposit to have a home phone. Not to mention furniture, food, toilet tissue,soap, etc.  If you can save about $2000 then you have a good chance of getting your own place. Just remember, when you move out on your own, then you  are own your own. It will be up to you to pay your own bills. Good luck!
ggfE4rlvaa	Face the music. They might not be as mad as you think, okay maybe they will but..better face it sooner than later. Accepting responsibility is a good start.

nINl1ynhaa	There is no obligation from the recipient to reciprocate with a wedding gift if they are unable to attend.    That is quite an unusual custom that I am not aware of exchanging gifts and your unable to attend an invitation.    However, it would be rude to return the gift, accept it graciously and respond in acknowledgement.    Bizzare to say the least.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	send them  an invitation, but send a note inside telling them to send their best wishes, instead of a present.  That way everyone feels good.|`|7bbfUYUOaa	I would invite them out of courtesy.  You never know who might get offended if you DIDN'T invite them, even if you know they probably won't come (I have a huge family spread across the country and this tends to happen a lot).  Of course, it is up to you.  Congrats on your upcoming wedding!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	It is rude not to invite them. Yes, there is a chance they might not come, but invite them anyways because it makes them feel wanted and that you care about them.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Invite whoever you would like to have in attendance. Most people really don't have any problems with travelling to a wedding and do so all the time.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not at all - because after all, you never know, they might decide to come!  Gives them the info, a souvenir, and a chance to pass along best wishes, and/or a gift, if they so choose.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it's better to invite than not.  who knows, they might be able to make it.  and the invitation  kind of serves as an announcement as well.  believe me, they won't feel obliged to send a gift if they can't come.  some will, some won't, but i'm sure they'd rather get the invitation and know they were thought of, rather than not be invited at all.|`|IcBdShB1aa	no it's just a courtesy to invite them in my opinion|`|aYVVwjBXaa	e-mail or call them and ask if they think they might be able to come before mailing out formal invites? it would give you a good chance to catch up with family and friends that maybe won't be at your wedding, and they won't feel obligated to gife you a gift. though they might anyways since you're so nice.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	It would be worse if you didn't because they would think you don't like them enough to invite them to your wedding|`|1FAggU5Zaa	okay yes u have to send them the invitation even though theire not going to be able to make it because then they are going to feel sad because u didnt invite them and about the gift who cares if they want to give u somthing or not.. =)|`|M7lOK6DWaa	I would invite them just to be safe because they could turn it around and think that you didn't invite them because you didn't want them there. It could start a fued if someone who is invited tells them he/she got an invitation when they didn't.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	You should invite them & add the courtesy message in the invites that you understand they may have quite a distance to travel & you don't want them to feel obliged or inconveinanced to attend, that you understand, but that you wanted them to know you welcomed them. On the ones that live far away, maybe even say, please do not send gift, just wanted you to have an invite because you are an important person in our lives.|`|i41tUVtIaa	No it is not rude.  If you don't send invitations they might think you were not thinking about them and there might be hurt feelings.  Send them an invitation and you can put on them "No gifts please".  Most people will either call or write and wish you good luck but some will send gifts-just accept them gracefully. It is not good ettiquette to return a gift like if someone mails you one.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	No. Its your wedding, not everyone else's wedding. Just invite the family and friends that you are close to. If others ask about your wedding and if they probe why they didn't receive an invite, just say you had a limited budget and you wanted to have a small intimate wedding.|`|K635IdQ4aa	No i dont think so, but dont expect or accept a gift either.|`|P5PoskpJaa	wont they feel left out|`|w9X1vQ24aa	Its rude if u dont invite them haha.|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	I would go ahead and invite them.  I live in KC as well, and when I got married also had family/friends all over the US.  Some came, but most didn't, but all were grateful for the invite.  If nothing else, it informed some distant relatives that my mom insisted on sending invites to that I was getting married.  ;-)|`|3XKUUf1paa	well it is not rude really if you think of it. you invited them but they just didn't come so if they don't come at least accept the gift. I'm chinese and when we invite people to wedding banquets their gift is $50 a person regardless if you came or not. it's our custom, but i wouldn't see anything wrong with people unable to come. you should invite and try to get as many people to your wedding. If they don't come then it's ok. you have to understand they might have other plans. good luck and congratulations!!!|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Even though you know some of the people will not be able to attend the wedding, it is nice to still send an invitation to them as well. For example, my cousin and her fiance were getting married in Hawaii. He was stationed in the military there. Still, invitations were sent to all family members even though she knew there was no way we could afford to fly there and attend. But it was nice to know that she thought enough of us to send us an invitation. And, congratulations on your upcoming wedding!|`|2gn5Z6Ppaa	Yes, You have to invited but only and both of your family and close friends, because is better to know that I can't go to your wedding 'cause I can't than I can't to go because you don't sent me an invitation.|`|3r1TwMCQaa	No it's not. In fact if you don't invite them you are sending the message that you don't want them there. It is better to invite them and allow them the opportunity to decline.|`|d40k56HHaa	It's not rude at all just make sure they know you know the might not be able to come and you understand that.  Send them pics and stuff to make them feel a part of it they will love that for sure.|`|rTiHfhWdaa	even though u know they can't come still you got to send them an invitation. one of my friends got married in US and i live in Canada and even though he knew i couldn't travel outside of Canada because i didn't have my documents but still he sent me an invitation. i just sent a card to congratulate him and his wife, i didn't send any gifts.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	You should invite all the people you want to be there, whether you think they can make it or not. And if you're worried that they'll think it's just asking for a gift, you can have separate cards printed that you can put in the invitations that say "The bride and groom request no gifts. Your presence or best wishes are gift enough.".|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	If it's somebody you sincerely wish could be at your wedding and who is emotionally close enough to you that he or she would go if there were no logistical problems, in my opinion it's perfectly all right to invite them. For all you know, a few of them are planning to be in town for other reasons and may wish to attend.    It's when you start inviting your fourth cousin three times removed or your dogsitter's mother that it becomes a bit oogy, because it can look like you're fishing for gifts. And that's oogy no matter where they live.|`|WLYuDrlMaa	if the didnt get an invitation, they would feel left out. So send them one, and dont pressure them. If they can make it, great! if not, then oh well. at least you are letting them know that you are thinking about them.|`|mF3PsJUVaa	id like to get an invite even if they knew i wouldnt be able to attend...it shows that you are thinking of them on your special day|`|crxbob5jaa	Only you know these people. Will they be upset if they don't get an invitation? Or will they be upset if they do?     I'd ere on the side of sending the invitations. They won't send a gift if they don't want to.|`|Oq4ShXTyaa	not really, you never feel obliged to send a gift just because you're invited and didnt go.....thats why there are RSVPS|`|P0tM3jGgaa	I think it is good to invite them but they may fill the same as you i dont no what to do i might have the same problem soon myself|`|zHothyW6aa	This one is tricky. i believe it is always better to invite them, however be aware some people may actually show up. Most people know you are not sending invites just to get gifts.. In fact if that is what they believe it is rather rude on their part. Go ahead and send the invites.|`|MztgUa0raa	No.  It's rude if you do not, as long as you would want them there if then were close.  The implication that goes along with an invitation (traditionally) is that the recipient should send a gift.  So you really do need to only send it to those close.|`|lmESBQb7aa	It depends on a few things. If they have specifically told you that they are busy on the day of your wedding, then definitely do not give them an invitation. It will seem like you are looking to get a gift. Otherwise, if this is not the case, I would still give them an inivitation so they do not feel left out.
1hciyvKdaa	What you can do it, greet say a third of the people, have someone announce its toast time, when your done, go mingle with another third of the guests, then have someone announce the cake cutting cermenoy, you cut the 2 slices, get somone experienced in cake cutting get some of the kids to help pass it out, then return to finishing up the guests greetings. That way you really dont have to rush anything, you just blend it all together and take breaks. Get somoene such as the best man to watch for cues or pick specific times. You wont get to sit for a long period but, you will do what matters most and that is mingle with those who love you.|`|i41tUVtIaa	No the receiving line is not tacky.  For a wedding this big it is the only way you are going to have a chance to greet everyone.  My cousin had about 300 at her wedding ( the bride, groom and the mother's and father's were standing there too-she didn't have to greet everyone by herself) Like if someone was your dad's friend he might just shake your dad's hand and not really say anything to you b/cause he knows your dad more.  Anyway all of these people were standing at the door of the reception hall and hugged or kissed everyone while they were going in.  That way once they were all in she didn't have to go around the room doing all of this, she was done and enjoyed her reception.|`|zHothyW6aa	I think moving from table to table is a much better idea... the receiving line is a little awkward.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	We had an evening reception, too. And we only had 70 guests. We started going around to the tables, and then we were called away by the photographer (for not more than 5 minutes) and then suddenly we were doing the first dance! Eventually through the night, we talked to almost all the guests, but there were a few we didnt speak to... and I still feel absolutely terrible about that!    Im like you. I dont like receiving lines; thats why we didnt do one. So my advice to you would be, let the DJ and the coordinator and everyone know that from x:00- y:00 you will be going around the tables, and nothing else. Then I dont think you will make the mistake we did.    Hope my experience helps you (at least some good would come of it).|`|AA11082914	I'm planning on having a receiving line at the church after the ceremony. My guest list is up to 250 already, and I think that will be much better to greet everyone. Yes, there's probably going to be some people that only hit the reception, but it probably won't be an ungodly amount like 250...lol.
2pfAw4Xkaa	Toys. shes only 7. Or a gift certificate to a toy store or a clothes store. Ask her parents what she likes.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Ask her parents what to get her. If they have no clue, ask what kind of toys she likes or give her a gift card to her local toy store and let her pick out what she would like.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	Well, you know, a Mc Donald's gift card is fun for that age, they feel so special like there "buying" what they want with there own money.    Or a Wal-Mart or like gift card, where they can go and get just what they want with what they have. they love it!
ze7xiJwTaa	Once he has received his green card he is legally allowed to live and work in the US. Get started on the divorce and definitely get a good attorney if you can. Unfortunately he'll still be able to keep his legal alien status as long as he's lawful. Unless...he has broken or breaks any laws (including DUI, drug possession/use, assault etc.)  and is convicted. That would get him deported. They frown upon aliens who do not follow the laws...|`|b1dpxQhtaa	Try to seek an annulment (he married you for a green card) and speak to a immigration and/or divorce lawyer.|`|dVlLahozaa	look for an attorney and consult him on the matter do this fast before any more time passes.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	See an Immigration Lawyer. <br>  Usually once signed and submitted, it is a legal binding contract. <br>  The lawyer will know if you have any way out.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	I would step very slowly and carefully but deliberately under a good lawyer's advice. USCIS could view this as immigration fraud on your part. How long have you been married ? If it's under a year it will send red flags up in Immigration and they will investigate you too.
2o3BHgCCaa	I know you don't want to have to leave him, but it may come to that.<br>  Give him one more chance but lay down the law; if he lies to you and spends more time with this girl and other workmates than nessecary  (ie. outside his work time) you will leave him. No more chances, no ifs, no buts. And you must stick to it too, you must be serious bout leaving if he messes up.<br>  I did this with my fiance for one of our problems and 7 months later and he hasn't slipped once.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow, that was really long.  like, i read it all but you may want to try to condense your questions next time so more people are likely to read them all.<br>  <br>  anywho....yeah, in your case i think you do have a bit of a right to be concerned.  tell him that you would much rather have him tell you the truth and that hiding it till you wheedle it out of him only makes it worse.  <br>  <br>  also, the whole bank account situation scares me.  is he using up the money you guys have saved together on his own tomfoolery? that right there is a major red flag.  that is YOUR money, to spend together, not his alone.  <br>  <br>    i do disagree with the fact that he shouldnt have any female friends.  in a good relationship with the proper amount of trust, it shouldnt matter WHICH sex you hang out with, so long as there is no cheating or lieing going on.  so if he was being honest and up front with you about hanging out with this woman, i see no problem with it.  however, since he is lieing, thats weird<br>  <br>  sit him down, and tell him flat out that if it does not improve within a month, then stay that way for several more months, there will be no wedding. but if at any point it gets worse, or you just dont feel like sticking around, leave.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He has already proven that he is untrustworthy and a liar, so why in the hell are you marrying him? I would have had him out the door before he could even spit out I'm sorry.|`|8ygky5g4aa	I don't think you are over reacting, but I do think you both should seek pre marital counseling if you are serious about getting married.  If he is unwilling to go to counseling, then you may want to rethink getting married to him.  If he is not willing to work on your relationship and take it seriously now, it is only going to get worse.  You can't change him only he can change himself.  Innocent flirting is one thing but inappropriate conversation is a totally different thing.  I would be furious if I were you!<br>  <br>  I think that pre marital counseling will definitely help.  An impartial third party is what he needs to see that his actions are disrespecting you!<br>  <br>  Good luck I hope it works out!|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	sorry but i think you need to re-evaluate this relationship.  he doesn't put you first at all by the sound of it and with the flirting and lying i have to say he doesn't sound ready to marry.  it also sounds like he is more concerned with what others think than anything else. that isn't husband material.  <br>  perhaps some counselling will help - if he won't go with you then you go alone - it will give you some much needed unbiased perspective on your situation.<br>  good luck sweetie!|`|ScHW4842aa	I recently got married. Let me tell you a little story: my husband is 21 and has a**holes of friends who club, visit prostitutes etc. Three days after we got married, he said he was going to hang out with the boys. I imagined that they would have a few beers, play cards or pool - they were out in clubs dancing. <br>  I cracked it. CRACKED IT. I smsed him at work the next day and told him not to come home. <br>  That night I wrote him a second message to come home, and he did. He was appologising as soon as he walked in the door, saying that he realised that he could not do those things anymore. <br>  We have our rules set out very clear. <br>  <br>  If my husband hit me - I would not leave him. If he did drugs - I would not leave him. <br>  <br>  If he behaved like your fiance - I would leave him. <br>  Please listen and understand. There is NOTHING in a relationship that hurts and tears your soul like when your husband acts like that with other women. Mine has not - but everytime he even does things like offer to drive our work friends who are female home while I am there, I feel so jealous inside just because he is being nice to another girl. I know its out of line, and I hide it because I know its my problem. <br>  <br>  I am sorry - but this man is not husband material. In marriage - you must treat it like something so important. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would already have gone crazy and maybe stabbed your fiance. <br>  <br>  Save yourself. <br>  I am being very serious when I say it : LEAVE.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well he's a liar and it doesn't seem to bother him when he makes you upset.  There's definitely a problem there.  I know how girls like that are ... they just try to creep in there and steal your guy.  <br>  <br>  First of all, there's a problem in the fact that you don't trust him.  You should never marry someone you do not fully trust - it's the foundation upon which marriage is built.  So until he gains your trust, you should really postpone the wedding.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, I agree with you that a man and a woman can not be good friends.  It just doesn't work.  One of them or the both of them will get a "crush" on the other one if they are spending that much alone time together.  I have no problem with my fiance being friends with a girl, but not BEST friends.  Not to the point where he would lie to me about being with her.  That's just asking for trouble.  And if he wanted to be friends with a woman, then she should be friends with me as well.  If he wants to hang out with a girl, then we can ALL hang out.<br>  <br>  Your fiance is putting himself in a situation which will lead to temptation.  On top of that, there's no better way to hurt a woman than to take another woman's side over hers.  It's like he's picking her over you.  And to make matters even worse ... he's undoubtedly talking about you to her behind your back.  Ugh!<br>  <br>  You should really talk to him about this one more time and tell him how you feel.  This woman can't be too good of a friend to him if she's willing to break up his relationship.  And I would really re-assess whether or not this is even the type of man you want to marry.  It's possible he just has the pre-wedding jitters or that he only hangs out with this girl because he likes the attention she pays him, but that can easily lead to you know what.|`|BHaIYH4Eaa	if i was you i would be EXTREMELLY WORRIED!<br>  he sounds like know one you can trust<br>  im sorry i feel that if he really loved you, that he would stop talking to all these other girls because he knows that you dont like.<br>  also, you cant have a relationship without 100% trust, if you feel that  he is hiding things from you then he is most likly doing things behind your back, you should be with someone you trust very much or your most likely going to get hurt.<br>  and for the fact that he took another girls side is just wrong, he should always take yours.<br>  he wouldnt have to get defensive if he didnt have anything to hide, so obviously that means he is.<br>  also he should be able to tell you anything, even if he knows that its going to hurt you. he sounds like he is a mager cheater.<br>  also you shouldnt have to feel that you dont trust him, he should make you feel that you should 100% trust him.<br>  im not sure if i forgot anyhting<br>  email me if you want to talk<br>  its froggystar16@hotmail.com<br>  i know its weird. i made it when i was younger.|`|J9Vmueauaa	You guys should talk to some type of specialist for couple troubles.<br>  If he resists, then maybe he just isn't right for you.<br>  He has already done sooo many deal breakers.<br>  honestly though, he sounds like a jerk.<br>  think about your future. hope this helps.<br>  since i read your WHOLEE question, heres<br>  <br>  mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225154537AAIWqOJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ehAG30Yvaa	He is DEAD WRONG on this one and I think you have every right to be concerned and worried about why he feels the need to hide things from you and why he thinks it's ok to be friends with girls at work. His behavior is perfectly acceptable for a single guy but definitely not for a guy who is engaged and says he's ready to start a family. I think it's time for you to sit down with him and be VERY CLEAR about how you feel and what you want your future with him to be like. He needs to know that you aren't ok with him having random girl friends and hiding it from you. When you're in a serious relationship out of respect for the other person, you don't need new girl/boy friends because it's just not appropriate. He doesn't seem to understand this and that's definitely a problem. He needs to realize that you trust him, but that you don't trust the girls he's with especially after knowing one has a reputation and the fact that he's trying to hide that he's spending time with her is not a good sign. Maybe he isn't cheating YET but it's only a matter of time if you allow this to continue. I really think that it's time for an ultimatum on your part. Put the wedding out of your mind because you can't continue in this relationship JUST because you have a wedding booked & paid for. He really seems to have lost his grip on reality and what's right and wrong here. Not that 2 wrongs make a right but maybe you should spend some time with guy friends of yours and see how he likes it. With no intentions other than friends but I guarantee he will be just as upset about it as you are about him. Maybe then he'll realize that he's wrong in what he's doing to you. He needs to make some changes or else I don't think you should marry him. You are right in thinking about what your future will be like especially once you have kids and it doesn't sound like he's anywhere near being ready for the responsibility of a wife and kids at this point. It doesn't mean you shouldn't get married at all, but maybe not until he's come to the realization that what he's doing isn't ok. And if he decides to continue and ignore your feelings than I really think you need to walk away. Don't marry him and hope he'll change because he won't. 4 1/2 years is a long time to be with someone and have to walk away but spending a lifetime with someone who doesn't respect you is even worse. It sounds like you have your family to back you up on this so rely on them to help you through it. Hopefully he'll make some good changes but if not just be glad you found all this out before you married him. Good luck.|`|hizRPh9raa	Not to worry you more than you are, but no...you aren't overreacting. He should not be running to her with your conversations...those should be private between you and him. First of all, he sounds far too immature to get married. And he also sounds like he may not end up being very faithful in the long run. If I were you, I'd have a long talk with him about your concerns and if he can't turn over a new leaf and start to realize who he should be loyal to...I would leave. That is not the situation you want to end up in the rest of your life.|`|j2C4riJlaa	OMG..You poor woman<br>  <br>  I feel for you hun! You know what, i would feel exactly the same, and i don't at all for one minute think that your are overreacting. Men like to make us believe that we are being irrational so they get away with more and let us think that we are in the wrong consiquently us not nagging them.<br>  <br>  I don't think its on that he is being seceretive with this girl and then reporting it all back to her. Wow, if that had happened to me, i would of booted him straight out, only because that is a trust between you two had been broken and i couldnt trust my boyfreind again after that. I know its harder to say then do, but as we all know, its trust what makes a successful and stress free relastionship. Welldone on holding back on bringing a child into this, until you are sure your ready to settle down in the right enviroment!<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him and say your conserns, let him know you don't feel comfatable and be firm, otherwize men will walk all over woman who let them get away with it. Honestly, you should say look its not on, and if it don't work?  <br>  You know what im going to suggest next..<br>  <br>  Go and do the excat same thing!<br>  Go out with the girls, make your self unavaliable at times, be mysterious, this will get him worried and keep him on his toes!<br>  <br>  Men need a little kick up the bum at times!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun, hope it all works out for you|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	No your not you should give him an ultimatum you or his little co worker slut and team thing he has cause if he really loves you and wants to be w/ you he would give that up in a heartbeat if he sees its hurting you and your relationship your suppossed to be happily planing your wedding and he's throw money away and is hangin out w/ other chicks not cool at all I don't think he's invested in this as much as you are as much as it hurts you you gotta set him st8 and make choose this shouldn't be happening too you right now im sorry that it has..|`|tVqLmImUaa	I'm sorry to hear about all this - totally sympathize. When you boil it all down, it comes down to the fact that he is NOT RESPECTING YOUR FEELINGS. So what if the girl is "harmless". So what if he thinks it's all innocent. So what if it IS innocent. That's not the point! The point is that any decent guy would respect the fact his actions are hurting his girlfriend and cut all contact.<br>  <br>  Here's what I think you need to do:<br>  <br>  1) Make it VERY clear that your feelings are being hurt, and you will not tolerate him disrespecting your feelings. Don't even dignify him with an argument/discussion - simply walk out the house and stay with a relative. Give him a shock. He obviously needs a shock to take the situation seriously.<br>  <br>  2) If this still doesn't work, and he brings up the lack of trust bullsh*t, then he is STILL not respecting/prioritizing your feelings, and not ready for marriage.<br>  <br>  3) If this does work, it will not only solve the problem, but set a precedent with his future behaviour, as he'll know you won't put up with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Remember - simplfy it: at the end of the day it's about him respecting your feelings.|`|rI5Gmqfoaa	Postpone your wedding and get in couple's counseling now.  Do not marry him at this point in your relationship.  I had to postpone a wedding and it sucked, but it was worth it in the long run.  Good Luck!

It can be bad for girls and guys, equally.<br>  <br>  Some people out there will claim to be our friends , then only use us for something that they couldn't get for themselves. They fake sincereity and can do it very well without us realizing that. In this world, 99% of all people out there are just out for themselves and/or for money or some kind of personal gain. With these types of people you have to tell them how to do just about everything in their lives because they are very high maintenace types as well. They listen very carefully at every word you say and don't say much when it is their turn to respond .  <br>  <br>  Genuine friendships are what we really want. They are the 1% of the population that matters most. They are low maintenace types and we can grow as individuals and as a group or couple as life goes into the future. They tend to only want the very best for us no matter what and only want us to be happy. All they want is to share their lives and experiences with us and never ask for anything in return. Any material wants and needs that they have for themselves, they easily get for themselves first, because they have the self confidence, self worth, and self esteem to do that.|`|56694975cf898eb95ae35390dd514aabaa	FRNDSHIP MEANS D SAME 4 ALL.

A decrease in sexual interest with you, secretive, doing things and going places that may not be her normal, getting phone calls and not talking in front of you, spending more time online (if it's an online romance).

3b08a7e7a884634537a3927840401a3daa	Okay, here's the deal. He's only asking for custody because you plan to move and he wants to stop you. You need to show that the move is good for your daughter for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  You have better job/career opportunities<br>  You will have family nearby to help out<br>  The child would have a better living environment<br>  You can still provide proper visitation with the child's father and allow them to maintain a close relationship (come up with a plan you can follow). <br>  <br>  You may need to show that the girl's father hasn't been using the visitation he has now, lives in an environment unsuitable for the child, or cannot otherwise properly provide for her. <br>  <br>  The court may rule you cannot move the child that far. They will not allow the disruption if it's an opportunity you could have in NJ. For example, they won't let you take her to Florida just because you like it there better or a friend or boyfriend is moving there. In fact, another man in your life would not be a good reason at all unless you are getting married.<br>  <br>  Unless you've really done some unsavory things, it's unlikely the court will remove the child from your home to grant primary physical custody to the father. The court's tend to stick with the status quo unless there's a really good reason to change. <br>  <br>  You'll need a GOOD attorney for this one, a custody and visitation specialist. Don't even think of trying to get this through the court pro se. You need someone who knows the case law on relocations.|`|d5beb65052ea472da53907d5f5cd691daa	Most courts favor joint legal custody, and visitation for the other parent.  But also he does have the right, in the courts view to protest a move, and often if you insist on moving to another state, the courts can and will grant custody to the parent who isn't relocating.  I would just hold out and stay put, so you can maintain custody of your child.  You willl probably NOT be moving that far away unless you give your child to your ex.|`|db52d621d4f2282a4cf3045b606959edaa	Joint custody means you guys would share parental time 50-50. That usually means 6 months with you then 6 months wth him. If you plan on moving that far away, be prepared to provide transprotation costs for getting her back and forth.  If he wants her to live with him 24/7, 365 he would have to go after sole custody.|`|AA11936973	Alot of parents that have joint custody don't live in the same state. I don't think there is any chance of getting joint custody and living with him, It is probably the courts decision or her decision of who she wants to live with.|`|AA11303550	No it doesn't mean you have to live in the same state that he does.<br>  However, it will take longer in court to establish your right to move with your daughter.....YOU BETTER HAVE A LAWYER With you when you go to court...<br>  the courts usually don't award custody to a father , unless the father can be prove you are unfit..which is usually very hard to do.<br>  There is one thing you need to know...the court will want to know why you want to move to FLA.   <br>  It needs to be a good reason....<br>  Do you have work and a place to live..in FLA. because the court will ask.<br>  the only stipulation that the court may put on you is..that you may have to pay to have your daughter transported back and forth to visit her father....And they will hold you to that.<br>  Joint custody is the friendly way of saying you two work out the arrangements and be nice.

Make yourself not change your mind, even if it means giving into pressure. But keep in mind, you might need something drastic and unspeakable to be done, to you, too.

Someone that can love me for who i am.|`|AA11411832	First all I can say is WOW. It would be interesting to find out what set your mind on this path. What has happened in your life to make you view marriage like this. <br>  I assume you are not fearful of commitment and being in a committed relationship. That you are comfortable spending the rest of your life with the person you love, without the piece of paper or ceremony. <br>  If someone is pressuring you into marriage. They may not understand why you feel the way you do. They mat see it as a fear of commitment. There is no law that you have to marry anyone. And as comfortable as you are. It's a bad idea. <br>  I have been in a marriage where as I felt the way you view marriage. It's made me wary of taking any vows again. Thinking I'll just date forever. Who knows.<br>  my advice is since you feel this strongly. Don't do it. If someone is pushing the issue and won't respect how you feel. Their probably not right for you. <br>  It's either psychosis or your a terribly free spirit that won't be tamed. Good luck.

H6xslmyvaa	Tell your mother that you'd appreciate it if she'd tell you the real reason she won't let you go.  Next, get the phone number of the mother of your friend (who's having the sleepover) and give it to your mother. Say that there won't be any worries, since the mother will chaperone.   Promise her that you won't go anywhere else with your friends, and to call your mother if there is any problem.    My mom used to say no if I wanted to go to sleepovers, but then after she talked to my friend's mom, she agreed to let me go to the sleepover. Good luck! :)|`|2JJLYSAKaa	maybe she doesn't like your friends parents or mom or dad or are they divorced?  do they live in bad neighborhood.  does you friend's mom do drugs or drink or have a lot of boyfriends    would she let you sleep at anorther friends house not just this one|`|6PVFDHnzaa	yea i really hate it when parents say "because". so i'm with ya there. and i feel for you that your mom wont let you spend the night out at age 13.     i'm guessing your want to spend the night at another girls house and not a guys house, right? if a guys house then i think it's kind of obvious why she wouldn't let you do that.     does she usually like to keep tabs on you in general? if so she's just worried about you and wants to be protective (maybe a bit to much). My suggestion in that case is to always present an "argument" that your mom can relate to. So instead of saying "mom i want to go to a sleepover because all the other girls go to sleepovers" .... say something like "mom, you know how you like to get away from the house and spend time with your friends, right? I like to do the same thing also and some of my friends are having a sleepover. of course my friends parents will be there and we will just watch a movie and play games."  (Something like that)      you know your mom, i don't. main point when asking parents for something is to ask them in a way they can relate to it.     but she also could have heard something "bad" about your friends parents which might explain why she doesn't let you go over there period. not sure. also give your mom plenty of time to think it over. for some reason parents need this "let me think about it" time period. start giving little hints at least several days in advance and also don't ask the final question at the last minute either. hope you can go! :)
2pfAw4Xkaa	Please go get help from a counselor or some adult you can trust. Talk to your mother again. Tell her you are seriously being hurt psychically and mentally by your father and you cannot take it anymore. Beg her to help you. If she doesn't do anything take it to the proper authorities. Tell them your father hits you and you need help. Good luck I will pray for you. :)|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Call the police, and call child services.

I am so sorry. Call child protective services. If you call 411, just ask for the number of child protective services in your city or near it and let them know about your situation. If that doesn't work, then call the local police station. I am so sorry and I wish you the best of luck. You shouldn't have to be living in that kind of environment.
zxQT3Uo5aa	The reaction is from being exposed to a naked woman.  The guilt and shame is the reaction because it was your mother.      She has been a woman all the years that you have known her.  The uncovering of her was a little much for you.  Now you know more than mentally that she is a woman.      The problem however, is that you have changed.  You are no longer innocent, especially since you took the time to observe the size of her breast. Now that lingering was too long.  Lets say you had been shocked to account for your not removing yourself sooner.  Also, lets consider the reaction of the erection, involuntary.      Issue resolved. Don't be surprised if she or others ask you what is wrong when you are in her presence.  They may not know what is different but it is discernible.  Come up with an answer now.  For the sake of propriety, you home includes other family members, not just you.  Do what you can to avoid such happenings in the future.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	what the hell is wrong with you?|`|AA12142423	wow this was only slightly disturbing.|`|hzxplycYaa	yes, it's wrong and unusual...but let's not forget, you ARE an adolescent.

Its unfortunate that you have encountered this episode. But, you have to move on as she is your mother after all. Do not let this chapter of your life prevents you to have a relationship with a lady you love. Sometimes, such encounter may disturb your mind momentarily. So take it easy and let it pass fast!|`|96R2sEgfaa	Omg! Kid. That's not right. And you must NEVER do that again. Never think of your mother in that way. If you like nude women, than use your internet to find them. Don't say anything to anyone. Just act as though nothing happened, and never let it happen again. If your mother knew what her son did im sure she would be disgusted. I really hope this is just a fake question to get attention. Cuz if you really did this, than you need to make some changes in your life. Try getting a girlfriend.|`|pws2l0Ckaa	What you felt was only ordinary human instinct, even if it was your mother. The choice to apologies is yours, and your mother will forgive you, but expect some awkward moments at the dinner table.|`|d5005b7e54b8bec0697ec47a83b82fb8aa	First of all try to get out all the guiltiness out of you.This is normal.That was explained by Freud as Oedipus complex.A theory considers the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be developmentally desirable, the key to the development of gender roles and identity.  You will forget all about this when you finally establish your first relationship.

kSlN7MjEaa	Oh dear you are in a muddle. but you havent got a fatal flaw.  You are in a new relationship and you have moved away from everythingyou know.  You are confused and depressed  You may need to see the doc and tell him how you feel.  I am real sorry you feel this way but in time you MAY  get used to it.   Give it your best shot - see the doc get a grip of yourself and try hard to stop lying in bed and drinking it will only make you feel worse.  We all make mistakes   This situation may not be for you.  Look into yourself and try and work out what you REALLY want from your life.  Is it worth the effort - do you really want this?  Be honest.  It could be too hard for you to handle.  But remember if you go back everything will have changed.  Thats life.  Go back for a couple of days and then decide -  dont burn your bridges - leave your options open.|`|47P7uLV6aa	You ARE letting everything slip away.  It sounds as if you might be clinically depressed.  This is a real medical condition and you need to see a doctor.    If that's not the problem -- then snap out of it girl!!  Good grief.  Why sit around and wallow in self pity?  Either decide to stay and make it work, or move back home.  I think that if you make a decision, you will instantly feel better.  If you are sure the relationship isn't going to work, don't put another week into it -- move.  If you love the guy and want a life with him, then GET A LIFE.      Whatever you do, STOP with the drinking and pills!!  They will only make things worse and you know it.  So every time you take a drink or a pill, you are deciding to be STUPID.  Stop that right now.      If you don't like waiting tables, then do something else.  But get a job.  Or, if money isn't a problem, then maybe start taking some classes.  You will learn something, make new friends and get out of the house.  All good things.    If you want to, you could look at it this way -- you are getting a fresh start.  A whole new life that you can fashion any way you want.  New home, new job, new friends.  A lot of people would LOVE this chance.    So get off your butt and DECIDE to be happy.  Good luck!|`|VL1NGMKraa	I dont know where to begin...I am going to say a bunch of things but they are in no particular order...    You need to reach out to some friends and speak to them, even though they may be in your home town you can still call or email them. If you dont have anyone you trust to talk about your problems with, i wouldnt mind being an email pal of yours...I have felt very similar to this "stuck" feeling you talk about...but for me the easiest solution is to talk to someone or to go out and do something new every day...  What i mean by something new can range from driving a different route home from work or to the store...buying a new food at the grocery store...or just evaluating my daily attitude and making a change for the better.   I know that sometimes we all get down in the dumps, but thats when we need to look at ourselves and see what we really want in our lives.  Maybe you arent happy with your decision to move an hour and a half away from your home town...what are you leaving behind that is making you not accept this new town? Change is usually good for us but we need to open up to it. BUT it sort of seems as though you were pushed into moving that far with him...is that true? Maybe now is the time for you to take your life into your own hands and do what YOU want to do...  Dont make the same mistakes twice...
ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Talk to your mom and let her know you are worried about her. Explain to her that she does not have to put up his behavior. Although it is her decision as to what she will do, all you can do is be there in support of her. Its always hard to make a decision to leave someone. If she cant make it on her own she may be reluctant to leave.

AA11840819	It's not all about size but how you use what you have.  Educate yourself on how to make a woman happy. Read and search the internet. Besides what is inside you truly is more important.  Most women would rather have a good man who is loving and considerate of them than someone with a large penis who is not.  You will find someone and yes you will get married.|`|oxmkllnWaa	yea there is such a condition, it's very rare, the REAL average size is less than you think...     most women don't really care if you can manage 4"... the g-spot is 2" inside and the clitoris is at the surface... there ARE size queens though.    I'm very average... and it has it's advantages (though it's true like all guys at times I wish I was the size of John Holmes)...     I get an amazing amount of oral sex for example....    and I try to see to it that my wife comes first... usually BEFORE penetration... if not (say she just jumps me) and she hasn't by the time I have I take care to finish the job.    take care of her needs, don't be concerned about your own and you'll end up with a woman who WANTS you in a most desirable way.|`|uQX1dchPaa	Well I have dated a man with that and we still had fun kissing ect. I broke up with him because he used drugs nothing to do with his... Well I guess some girls will care and some wont there are other things you can do to please a women.

AA11840819	I have a friend who just lost her partner of 10 years.  You will have to go thru the grief.  Try to stay busy and spend time with friends.  If you have pets focus some on them. Remember your partner is in a better place where no one judges or treats another badly.  Try not to make any rash decisions right now. Give it some time.  Time helps the loss but you will always feel the loss just not as severely as now.  There are no answer just that loss hurts.  When you love someone for 22 years they are your life.  Now you will have to find a new and different life.  Maybe you can get a new hobby or interest and search for that new life.

Me being a girl cant accept "PEEPING OF BUNS" thong if shows is acceptable but parts of buns nO way buy her some grey matter rather than low waist jeans|`|SFMQrT4Haa	I have the same prob I wear very low pants because its comfty and that's how I like it but if my bf told me how embarassing it is and how it makes me look in the eyes of other people I would cover up because I don't wanna look that way in other people eyes but I don't let my whole behind be free and out but sometimes it happens but I understand hope I helped
76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	get her the cut she likes.  doesn't matter if it's too small because in a few years she can set it in another ring with additional stones if you have the $$$.  some ppl do that for their anniversary down the road.  google the 4 c's to make sure you get a good quality stone, and the setting is easy, just yellow gold I guess.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	well if she doesn't like white gold or silver, then your other options are platinum (looks like white gold or silver) or yellow gold.     go to www.jewelryexchange.com or www.bluenile.com  they have loose gia and flawless diamonds for some really good prices.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	ok get a single diamond  and the actual ring should be thin    i thats how the usual engagement diamonds are    and for wedding rings  there are a lot of diamonds|`|oReJfax3aa	i really like this style!!    http://www.jewelryimpressions.com/files/...|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	I have long thin fingers if that helps lol. I personally like solitaire rings... 1 round diamond, that's it. A lot of women like that because it is simple and classy.|`|d3icrU62aa	defff the past, present, future ring....very meaningfull. And it seems like she likes diamond cuts...so get her that in yellow gold.  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|MztgUa0raa	Do you know that she wants you to choose the ring?  My husband asked me if I wanted to pick it out, or if he would ike me to pick it out.  I was able to choose a gorgeous ring.  his thought was that I was going to have to wear it for the rest of my life, so he wanted to be sure I liked it.  (plus, I'm picky).|`|qW4GVjROaa	I really think jewellery is such a personal thing. unless you are completely confident about her taste, I would buy a ring, but let her know she can change it if she is not happy, both my daughter and daughter_in_law did that and nobody was offended. Or ask her to marry you and take her to the jewellers with you. good luck
GJ3s6g2laa	What are you worried about "NOT GETTING ANY GIRL" or 'NOT HAVING ANY JOB". Figure it out, prioritize and then you will be able to get over with your emotional breakdown|`|JtdcQ5deaa	Sounds like an emotional break down to me. I get those too. I had one last night about college and work and bills... I haven't found a cure for the amazing stress that life brings but I am always trying. quitting your job will be good for the time being to get you life in order. Another way to organize your life is to keep a journal, daily or weekly. A good stress reliever will be hanging out with friends and letting loose, then getting back to work or school. Don't bother about relationships for now, you need to focus on you, and when your life gets back in order and you are confident in happy tons of people will be attracted to you. Put together and confident people are attractive!|`|KYOUGe8qaa	Jobs, money, school, all of that is stressful enough, so don't beat yourself up about any of that stuff.  You sound like a hard working responsible fellow though, and you should be proud of yourself for that.  As for the girls, be yourself all the time.  Someone will come along and appreciate that.  It might not seem like it now, but it will happen.  Hang in there, don't let yourself get too down, things will get better.|`|VL1NGMKraa	Dont worry...there is financial aid for college...things just take time...i was just feeling similar to this a few days ago and before that a few weeks...i have this terrible feeling that i'm going to fail in life all the time...Right now since you want to go to school, thats ALL you should focus on...i assume you are still young, like 20's? You really have nothing to worry about...  Think of it this way, if you get through school undistracted by a gf, when you finish school and get a career going you will get all the girls you want and you will have LESS stress and a better job... What else could you ask for? Just write out a plan for the future and take life one day at a time. You will become stronger everyday that you make it and things will look up...  Sometimes life feels hopeless...sometime i feel hopeless but i know that i want to get out of that mess...i want happiness and i assume you do too...  DONT WORRY...
N5LbkoiYaa	well in that case (you knew eachother) and only as long as both of you knew what this was before going into it i don't see any problem with it. As much i want to agree with the whole romance crap i cant bring my self to do it, love has little to do with sex (in my opinion anyway) if you had a good time and im sure the guy had a good time (it soesn't take that much to make us happy) leave it at that. just be care full if you keep doing it someone is bound to get hurt because sooner or later one of you will meet someone else and thats when it starts to get complicated.   this guy  :)|`|pDqsFgjyaa	The only thing they would have attached to you, would be their plug-in, in your socket...|`|5CwL5wauaa	Sex is for enjoyment and for having babies when you want them.|`|wE2etBzbaa	This really depends, some guys get attached to hookers, and they become mad.     but I wouldn't be like that,  a girl you have one night stand with, is a girl you have ONE night stand with [period].  and we don't need to judge people. I don't judge her, but might never want to be partner with her.|`|zzBt8q3zaa	When I was younger I didn't have a problem with it, and usually I wrote them off as easy hit and run.    I am older now and want more than just sex from a female.|`|wPABw3U0aa	honestly the fact that a guy even has one night stands is obvious right there that the sex was done for sexual gratification ONLY.    if a guy just meets a girl and barely knows her. and then has sex right away. its because hes horny and wants to get some. he hasnt spent enough time with her to love her or even develop a slight crush on her. therefore whatever sex he has with her is just for sexual enjoyment and NO he wont feel attached to her. its no different than a guy having sex with a prostitute. thats why I think one night stands are absolutley disgusting. im a girl by the way. but i answered this question because i felt I had alot of insight.    honestly if you really want a guy to have meaningful sex with you because hes in love with you and wants to be close and intimate with you then you NEED TO WAIT. and take your time. im not sayin wait till marriage because I find that rediculous also. just wait until you have a really good bond. know eachother very well. and have said I love you to eachother. if youre in love before sex youre going to feel it during and after sex. if your not in love before sex then youre not going to fall in love after sex.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	wouldn't do it in the first place. i need to know the person i'm with, before i have sex with them.........|`|zGhDt3dpaa	It depends. Sex can do crazy things to a guys mind, trust me. The fact that the guy got laid in the first place means that the whole thing is probably regarded as a one night stand. but then again everyone is different and it also depends on how well he knows the girl.|`|XRFznIZmaa	I had meaningless sex once (Im 25) and I will never have it again.  I believe in having sex only with someone I love and that loves me.  I felt like a douche bag after doing it.  It was with someone I work with, but she just wanted to have meaningless sex as well.  It didn't bug her at all, lol, but the next day I just felt horrible.
jqhvxWzGaa	when i first started reading your question i liked the idea, but now at the bottom, i'm not crazy about it.    i think you have to pick "elope" or "wedding".  you can't have your cake and eat it too. lol    the practical stuff you mention can wait a few months, don't let that decide for you. you've always wanted a wedding with guests. your friends want to witness the actual moment. your families might want it to "count" being in a church.  those are the important things, you only get one shot at that. wait and do the real wedding.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	as far as the 'specialness' wearing off, only time will tell if that happens to you.  but as far as the rest, other people have done this.  if that's what works best for you, certainly have the legal ceremony now and the reception later on.  there's nothing wrong with this.  my daughter thought about this but it worked out better for them to go ahead in a more 'traditional' manner.|`|PBdPD748aa	i know couples who decide they want to elope, or go on a destination wedding and then have a huge celebration on their return.    I may be doing this myself and I dont think anything is wrong with it at all! It is you and your man's day and it is a beautiful idea of the both of you spending it together, as one, without all the added drama and fuss.    When you get back i would recommend, not to have a ceremony again (as that is done) but rather a post wedding reception/ celebration so all your loved ones can celebrate your union as a couple.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	You dont get two weddings. End of story.      **Well of course it will be less special! Because it will be the second time you will have done it. Signing a piece of paper is every bit as valid as a big to-do, and you know it or else you wouldnt want to do it. Choose one wedding and one wedding only.|`|1dowIwI7aa	I know that whatever we do it will be the best thing for us!!! I love you!!!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	To me, this says you want to get married but you want to lie about it. Shouldn't you be excited about getting married? Marriage is about the vows you take, not just the legal documentation and the health benefits you can get. If you elope, you're married, that's it, end of story. Hiding that from people just doesn't make any sense. Marriage is supposed to be a joyous occassion, not something hidden from the world.     Good luck!

Sure that's a nice move...but also just saying.  "Hey, what's your number?  We should hang out some time."  That worked well for me in college.    As for the paper, and telling her you like her.  I guess it worked out for you...but isn't it similar to say...I don't know...a kid giving a note to a girl saying "Do you like me?" with a big box that says "YES" and a smaller box saying "no"?    Nonetheless, congrats on your new relationship.|`|rd5468H1aa	Lol...okay...|`|yllIJiGraa	Dude tht was an awesome smooth move that gives me an idea so thanks man and good luck with your woman.|`|IXskJPlVaa	No rules - you got what you wanted and the relationship has taken off.

Best of luck.|`|tUcBasPfaa	ok smooth move whats the ? ?|`|Gk8Ya4WGaa	so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!! are you sure your not a homo|`|li0ZuJFCaa	Quite smooth. nice story, all the best!

If some guy came at me with that weak game I'd laugh in his face.    Good that it worked for you though....
nA97uWdyaa	Reality check.    What do you want a phone number for? You had her right there in front of you! So what you basically sub-communicated to her was "Hey, I'm too chicken to express my attraction to your face right now, so please give me your phone number so that I can brag about it on Yahoo and maybe someday I'll pluck up the courage to say what's really on my mind."    Don't be a lame excuser.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	Yeh sure|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	smooth move, u have done it neatly, and it is the first time I heard that she dialed the number in  It gives great ideas, I shall try it next time.  u r a genius|`|G1OJNCF4aa	i think it's pretty smooth lol  as long as your weren't awkward and did it in a cute confident way. Awkward nervous boys gotta gooo!|`|EgNgEVaRaa	defiantely lol im going to have to use that sometime|`|pBMfANkwaa	thats a great move,,  excellent one!!!  good luck|`|NgpHScXnaa	omg u asked this yesterday....

RDIE9tKUaa	i love ur opinion it rocks keep it going i hate it when ppl say stupid ****|`|1kSRPadaaa	my friend is 17 and about to have a baby.    personally i feel she is living such a better life now, this baby has turned her life that was spiralling out of control around and i am thankful for it.    i can't wait for her to be born!!|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	This isn't a question!  But MOST teenaged mothers are irresponsible.|`|MN9535Itaa	I agree. I have a few friends that are teenage mothers and they take care of their kids without any help at all.|`|seC7X4HUaa	and what exactly is your question?|`|Eh67BAU0aa	hi! You are right to feel angered and tired of people making judgement. I didn't have my first bub till 25 but my best mate had her first bub at 17 and now we are 30 and I have watched her raise 3 wonderful daughters and when her oldest turns 18 she will be young enough to really enjoy the experience with her. Being a mum is hard work and I'm glad I started when I did so I still have enough energy to cope, lol. Try to ignore the comments and just be happy with your lovely young family.
hFKH6GIYaa	I totally think you're making the right decision. She does stuff that you're not down with and those are things you don't want to be around. It's your right to choose your own lifestyle.    I mean, in all honesty, she didn't MAKE you drink, you know? But, we are only human, and we drink, and do stuff that we regret... but you can't put full blame on her for what happened. It takes two to "tango".    Maybe, you should straight up say "hey, I don't want to get romantically involved with you.". Sometimes, you just have to be upfront and direct with what you say.|`|R4MXqBHhaa	Simple, just slap her child, that will say everything with out even having to say a word!|`|smEPI9G2aa	I think you are doing the right thing because if I am to understand you correctly, you don't really "like" her.  It sounds like this was a fun hookup, and someone fun to flirt with but not someone you could ever be serious about.  The problem is she might think because you and her got together, you must have cared about her at least a bit.  You said that she took advantage of you, but lets be honest...you hooked up with her.  If you are a grown up, you made a choice to be with her.  It doesn't sound like you want to be with her, so just be honest and tell her the way you feel.  You don't have to be mean about it, but you might let her know that you think the age difference and lifestyle difference makes any relationship with her not feasible.  For future reference, don't sleep with someone that you really don't want anything to do with, especially someone you work with.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I've never heard of a guy being taken advantage of... thats a new one  but either way, you should have said no if you werent interested in her  but if you dont like her, dont be with her. Some people have certain standards that must be met. You cant lower your standards & be in a relationship you hate.|`|BINKHZKtaa	Dude.  You're in college.  She has kids.  That is all you need to know.  STAY AWAY!!    It's not shallow, it's smart.  Think with your head and not with... well, your other head.|`|c9z51gqlaa	youre so responsible. thinking about your future and all. and yes u made the right choice. she ****** up and had a kid..you gotta finsih your college stuff before you be taking mare of some other mans kid.|`|RCDDNUWgaa	it looks like shes in a desperate situation and is trying to find a father for her daughter. it gets lonely to be a single parent but i don't even see why you had sex with her anyways you work together so no matter what your work place is now going to be uncomfortable regardless what you decide. but if you don't want to be with her tell her that's not what your looking for in your life right now. its blunt and to the point but if she really wanted a relationship she would have got to know you and established that before sleeping with you instead of sleeping with you and then wanting you to be her boyfriend. in the future if you don't want a relationship with someone let them know before you sleep with them.|`|umGi6gTcaa	You're making the right decision. Just tell her that while you like her, you're both at different stages in your life. Apologize for leading her on but let her know that it's in both of your best interest to just be friends.    If she still persists you then just say, "I tried to be nice about it but you're just not getting it. I was drunk and it was a mistake. I'm just not interested in being in a relationship with you.Please just accept that."    It doesn't matter if you're nice or horribly blunt, chances are she will act like a *****, bad talk you and be mean to you for turning her down. Good luck with that lol.    Please don't blame it on alcohol, I've been falling down drunk plenty of times and was still able to say no, even to guys I wanted. Face it, you were horny and she was an easy lay, don't blame it all on her.    Also "playing it cool and flirt back" was you leading her on.
eMtH8IAwaa	Maybe you can look her up online (myspace, facebook, etc) and see if she is single. It's the plot of lots of movies, and maybe could work in your favor if she returns the feelings.     I idolize people too, it is a problem. Most people are selfish and uncaring about others. Place your needs up front when dating--make time for you and try to avoid the pit of co-dependence. It's not always easy.     Also, get some hobbies that are yours alone. This can be a 'you' space that no woman enters. Then, you won't be 100 percent hooked on someone for pleasure in life. Keep your heart guarded till you know someone. And have hope. :)|`|blirKov3aa	ask her to make sure she love u,then u can take actions,such as to find her,and  bring up your love,|`|WBVw1SK0aa	Dont call yourself a wuss, I wish more men were like yourself!! Go get her, stop dreaming and do something about it! You won't know what she  s feeling until you ask!
5fe1d29bd466e79a18a65a07d90f084faa	Believe it or not, girls actually like guys that are smart. You just need to approach her in a way that she doesn't consider too much or pushy. A girl likes a guy who's confident and just goes for it. Don't go up to her and say "Wow you're hot!" because that is basically a way of saying "I'd like to get you in the sack". But a woman would be extremely flattered if you walk up to her casually and say something like "I hope you don't find this too forward, but I think you are very beautiful." or if you have a bit of confidence issues...try something you could do. For instance if you're good at history and you know she's having problems ask if she needs help, or tutoring and volunteer. Don't be pushy, but be sensitive and understanding. If she drops something...help her, if someone makes fun of her...stand up for her. Also...find out about her interests...a girl loves a guy who can share her interests with her and talk to about almost anything. If there's something specific she likes like...Horseback riding...(I suggest researching about horses first), and then you can ask her if she would teach you to ride. This would give you a common bond, and something to do together. Don't try to be someone you're not, but confidence is important. Make her laugh...girls definetely love a funny guy (but not a clown).     Best of luck hun! :-)|`|JR1MKBKtaa	Just talk to her, you would think that sounds really stupid, but once you get the courage to talk to her good things will come, if you simply talk to her atleast once a day, by a month you guys will be like friends, and then a relationship is just an easy next step.|`|V1FmI6EOaa	just be yourself... though making here laugh is never bad|`|2jnpvyzaaa	take her out|`|zWqKuIQuaa	How many times are people going to ask this question.  If you need to come in here to ask then you dont have what it takes.    Forget about these girls saying, be all nice to her and write her poetry.  This is fine, after you have got her.  Before that it will just creep her out.    All you can do is to get noticed somehow and show interest in ONE thing she is passionate about.|`|uB0QueSOaa	i think that u have to be yourself its not right to change for some one...i'm pretty sure that if you just man up youll do just find|`|wE2etBzbaa	Which girl, I don't see any?    it is not impossible to be likable, just have more conversations and you ll learn, and be more fun and creative. if you are a geek, you can come up with solutions.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	always talk to her nice  cherish everything she does  and give her a hug whenever you see her  and tell her how her day went or hows it goin  be a sweet talker.!!most girls fall for sweet talkers  personally i love them lol|`|Gslf19Uvaa	TALK.TO.HER.  most girls like to be talked to. when they start getting to know you, if there's something there, then they'll start likin you.    geez. do NO guys know to just talk to a girl?|`|8FLJueRjaa	start textin her and bein friendly  this is what i do    i like music so i will text a gurl some lyrics to a song (an obvious song)    and have her gues the name of it. its a light way to start a conversation  and whenu get more comfortable start sending lyrics that kinda make it seem like u are hitting on her    example "i want your body need your body as long as u have me u wont need nobody"  whatever u like - TI  and just work into it and eventually tell her how u feel...    but make sure u tell her or else u get screwed over  its better get shut down than to never have told her...|`|cbvRRZ5Oaa	compliment her  i like compliments myself  if she seems intrested in you stand close to her  when youre talking to her say her name  like  Hey (name)  whats up  then to get her attention again be like (name) what are you doing later?    you know what i mean?|`|qpkNrn8iaa	ok   be nice to her  act all mushy and sweet girls luvv dat but still be manly  get her phne number  tell her how u feel about her she will never know un less you tell her|`|vWrpyzQZaa	I think you should first find some things that she likes that you can talk about. Find some things you guys have in common. If you don't have anything in common, pick something she likes that you can learn a little bit more about. For instance, a certain author. This is a perfect excuse to talk to her like a friend to ask her about this author. This is going to put you in her mind as someone she can relate to.     I'm on messenger if you want to hear more...lol  mrsloclark|`|iQ13PoEiaa	breathe. when you see the girl that you like, just breathe. in through your nose, out through your mouth, one or two deep, deep breaths. it calms down your entire body and makes you feel so much better. then just be yourself. if she doesn't like you for you, then find someone better.|`|5s90en0iaa	be a jerk...girls love jerks|`|c32MJwDJaa	This link may give you a couple tips    http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Girl-to-Lik...|`|tok9sb6daa	if your a geek, do your research! hahhh    alright well dont feel the need to impress her, spend time with her, learn to make her laugh, and to have her feel comfortable with you.  you cant exactly force her into liking you, but be really close friends...and well you never know what could happen
AA10172433	Put yourself in his shoes: He has no reason to break up with his girlfriend for you! And why should he? He gets the love of his girlfriend AND the love of you... if he breaks up with his girlfriend he doesn't gain anything, because he already has your love.     Don't spend anymore time with him until he's broken up with his girlfriend. If he asks, tell him it just feels too much like cheating and it doesn't feel right for you to spend time together while he and his girlfriend are still going out. That way, he'll have something to gain by breaking up with her.

(hopefully)|`|SOW2ZwkKaa	well if she wrote on her myspace that she trusts him, she probably already caught you guys hugging or whatever then she blew up at him about it.  then he prob said nothing was going on with you two and nothing ever would, so now that their relationship might go down the drain, he's screwed, bc if he goes to you now, he's gonna look like a huge liar.
aXOyK3uBaa	Do not confused "LOVE" with -->> the natural concept of ATTRACTION.    ATTRACTION -->> is an INSTANT thing that can happen in seconds or minutes. "Wow! Look at that. I am attracted to her." I love her legs. I love her smile. The sound of her voice. Her hair. Whatever! That's it. Done. You attracted to that person.    LOVE -->> Is built on a a much longer list of things that are WORKED ON and EARNED . . . . . .  over TIME.    Confusing "love" with "attraction" is where you get chaos and confusion. Because it is possible to be attracted to man you don't even LIKE.    And that's OK. Because you are only ATTRACTED him.

If the spouses do not indulge in sex, it keep on incresing till the D day comes at least for a while.|`|saAKZEdOaa	Life is far less complicated if people dont fall in love , then they can do as they please not having to worry whether it is ok with the other person or not , they can change any aspect of their lives without any second opinion ......even change the country they live in !. Not to mention spare themselves the tears and heartache .The possibilities are endless. Come........fall in love.......with your OWN SELF.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Because we are all one in the same. We connect, and we relate. And we find things out about other people that are similar to elements in our life, that excite us and genuinely interest us in that person. To know that love is even possible to achieve is a great thing. People dont want to be lonely, they want to have somebody to be counted on by and to count on, to love and to be loved, and to make that sacrifice that is, in itsself, called love.    Love is a connection of not only flesh, but spirit, mentality, and emotions. Imagine seeing the beauty of the universe when you look into your loves eyes.  Thats why people love. Because they choose to. And love is a lot better than loneliness, trust me.
EsnFmcMFaa	why are you trying to push him away  just because you are close doesnt mean that you have to have a love relationship  i mean friends are supposed to be close  how else is he supposed to help you and listen to you if you dont let him  in  the way you described this guy he seems to really care about you    you dont want to push him away|`|GeHxekEMaa	im that girl|`|aEonduUUaa	its his decision respect it.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	Just let things be! Limit how much you hang out with him and this may ket some of these feelings die down!|`|8sWdrYvVaa	Sounds like standard high school drama from everyone, including the too-pure girl.    Try finding new interests that involve hanging out with a lot of new people, like Theater.  If you're already doing that, try a sport or something.    *Don't* think that you can fix this by trying to date another guy.  If you aren't over the guy you LOVE yet, that will just compound the drama.

But it really depends on how you feel. I don't think I could ever be the "other" person. Like this boyfriend of hers probably doesn't know that she flirts with you. What if you go out with her and she does it with other guys? Get over her, she's not worth it.|`|HF9v91XPaa	Ah, I know well this trap, that I do. I don't think that you are wasting your time, but I do think that she is leading you on. I wouldn't exactly tell her to f %k off, but I wouldn't cater to her every whim.    I hate to see nice guys taken advantage of. Remember that you'll be there when she needs you. Also remember that She needs YOU. Not the other way around. You don't need her.     One thing I would do for sure is to talk to her as a friend about other girls that you like. That might put pressure on her to make a move on you before you move on.    You'll be find champ. Live this one out and you'll be ok. I understand your frustration though.

UinOWcMUaa	Don't flirt, just be yourself. If you like someone just it is better to tell them. If your looking to flirt think about the mix signals you will send if the guy starts liking you then you find out he is not your type.

HF9v91XPaa	You ought not to change your personality to make other people like you. There's a difference between people wanting to hang out with you because they are charmed by your personality, or they find you to be a reliable friend, and people liking you because of the fake parts of your personality that you've added.    As an addition, Flirty girls usually have a hard time "becoming" shy.     To answer the question though, I really like shy girls. I'm sure that it might have something to do with how most flirty girls I know are stupid/slutty. I know that there are smart, non-slutty girls that flirt a lot and that are nice and all of that jazz.    But the shyness is just soooooo cute and endearing to me. Its like her personality is a secret shared between herself and the people that she's close to.|`|kHX1h7LFaa	I personally prefer the shy ones. Cheating chances are lower as well as worries and jealousness.

15ffd7adf8caf120b0a8331ff718983baa	I loved the way your eyes would get all small and chinky whenever you grin. I loved the way your imperfect, yet beautiful teeth looked when you smiled. I loved the unique way your hair looks when you thought you were having a bad hair day. I loved how so damn cute your laugh was compared to every girl I knew before you. I loved the sensation I felt whenever I would touch your soft hand. I loved the way your legs moved when you walked around the store. I love that you knew what you wanted in life even though it may not be the most prestigious thing.    Unfortunately, I couldn't find the confidence in myself to change and continue going after you even though we both had a thing for each other.I'm not like the other guys.And then one day you just literally dissapeared, and even though you've probably forgotten about me now, it's hard for me to get over you.|`|blirKov3aa	u are attractive to ask the question like this...  yes  likelike u|`|PuopJHPcaa	okay fine if u wanna fall then ill just push u thats the best i can do|`|0UQIdbNJaa	Umm...I like you.|`|5UwQtCzOaa	i don't get it... if you want to fall then fall...|`|umGi6gTcaa	huh?

74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	Sounds like fraud and stealing to me. I would put the money back NOW and tell your friend. And apologize. You are being sneaky by not wanting to face your friend and that is not right. You need to tell her you are sorry and promise to never do that again. You really need a conscience check....so what if she won't miss it....it is her money and you stole it.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	It depends on a lot of different things. But, if she's your friend and won't miss it why didn't you just ask to borrow it? I'm not judging, but you really shouldn't ever steal from anyone, and I don't think that you are a friend to her if you do that kind of thing. Get yourself together.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	you already did it. deal with it. wow i wouldn't want you as a friend. but thank god i dont do those checkbook things, huh??     well we all know WE can trust you!!! haha|`|X3BoYkQUaa	omg...hell yeah you can get into trouble, thats if your friend isnt so happy about what you did. you might cause an overdraft without the person knowing....not to mention forgery...its still stealing if they didnt give it to you...try asking next time. im sure they wouldnt have mind.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	Stealing is stealing.    You don't have permission.      You can try to justify it any way you want, but it is still wrong, and you know it.  That is why you posted this question.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Your friend can count, I'm sure. The checks are numbered. And on the bank statement, there will be a star for the notation that the sequence is out of order, and there will be a little notation of 'missing check' But if the check did go through there is still a record of where it was cashed. There is a record of the signature and you, my friend--using the term loosely--are busted. Better confess, and maybe she won't take you to court.|`|a2tptFbqaa	Nope.. fixing it doesn't absolve you from the crime.. and what you did was a criminal act. However, your friend has to file charges... What you did was dispicable. You should be more worried about how your friend will feel when they find out you violated their trust. You seem more worried about if your in trouble. Which tells me that you are extremely selfish. Grow up, take responsability for your actions and hope your friend is mercifull. Otherwise, have fun in prison.. because if you don't change your ways, that's were your going.

Is it you who made her mad? If it is you should find a right time to apologize.Talk to her, but if she ignores you , DON'T IGNORE HER. Friends could be stubborn sometimes. You could still be nice to her , maybe she would forgive you.    Is it someone else who made her angry? Let her be angry,let her express herself, you understand. You could invite her out and talk when she is least angry.

Believe me my bf does this too and then he's another way around me. He shows his sensitive side around me and I can call him pet names that I know normally he would be embarrassed to have other guys hear. A man has to be a man. Nothing wrong with it unless he acts like an asshole around others and treats you bad.
nBQeSu2faa	My My..she really is getting into your business...this is just not acceptable at all. I think it's your husband that should deal with this matter, because it is his mother...you need to come up with a plan together but let him deal with it. Maybe she does not understand , that your business , is not her business...so give her the benefit of the doubt...Your husband needs to explain to her...this is his family and he likes to keep his business between you and him,  he appreciate her concerns and her helpfulness BUT  he wants to do things his way...Of course all this should be done in a calm, pleasant , nonjudgmental way. Maybe he could make a joke of the fact he is a BIG BOY now. You are right to nip any of this stuff in the bud..if you allow this to go on , you will have terrible problems with her down the road...it's possible she might be hurt when he speaks to her...but in time and with patients, kindness, she will get over it.|`|OG3lycSPaa	You need to nicely ask her to stop delving into your business. You have to talk to her even if its uncomfortable. She may not realize you feel this way. She may not care, but you have to at least give her your side. If you don't say anything and let this keep going on for a long time it will only get harder to talk about.|`|12c28f1e014ce89fc25267640bc651d6aa	Nice or not,  you have to stop it.  It will ruin your marriage,  That is no joke.|`|PBdPD748aa	wow that is really innappropriate! you and your husband are your own family now, shes gotta stop thinking she runs the show!!    You really need to sit down with your husband and discuss this. He should be the one to tell her what is acceptable and lay down boundaries. You need to do it, it will only get worse and out of hand. It is not mean at all, everybody needs boundaries!     Its not healthy or normal what she is getting up to so by your husband being strong on the issue and telling her to stop she should get the point.    Good luck!

Listen dnt make fast decisions, people, society etc etc r just nothing, if u both are confident and ok with your age status. what u  need is mental strenght, and since you are younger, u have to be mentally ready for the most of your sacrifices. becoz, He being elder will be dominating in a relationship.|`|09MlFkEWaa	I think if it is true love, then it shouldn't matter, if you are truly happy with it , then you shouldn't worry about it .. haven't you heard the saying "live your life so you have nothing to regret"  So if you don't think you will regret it , then go for it .

I am in my very early 20's and in love with a man in his late 30's. Many people think this is too large of a difference, and it can be. Why? Priorities, Maturity, Future Goals, etc.     While you may be mature, you have not had as much time to "figure out" what you want/what you don't. He has.     Now, can you be friends? Sure. Should you date? Perhaps after you have known him a long time (a few years). I say this because you want to be clear that he thinks of you as a Girlfriend type and not just a supporter. Plus, you would not want to be his rebound if you really like or love him.     My two cents is--try to be a pal for now, and for a while. The age difference, while just being "a number" can still influence things!|`|BbRewQjQaa	Age gap is not issue if you two have the same goals. But if you two do not have the same goals it can be an issue.|`|fEpLhqA1aa	You are both considered adults now. If you love and care for someone that's all that should matter. People are going to talk but let them, it's your business and not there's. Good Luck!|`|ZrNvXMSlaa	In my opinion,  if your happy in the relationship then other people around you shouldn't have a real say in the matter. It really would be up to you and him to decide if your comfortable with it because no matter what society is always going to look down on others and not know the basics.  It's all about what you and him decide.|`|7gUllOfUaa	My parents are 12 years apart and have been married for 27 years.  I view age as just a number, as long as both people are over the age of 18.  However, there are some things to consider.  Is there a possibility that you are tying to fill a father figure role?  You are still very young and have a lot of life to experience yet.  Be aware that the two of you may have a difficult time relating to each other.  Things that are important to you may seem immature to him and you may not understand why certain things are important to him.  Maybe you are a very mature 18.  I don't know.  Also, be cautious of his intentions.  There is the potential that he views you as an easy target.  He may think you are more easily manipulated.  Also keep in mind he was expressing interest in you while in a relationship.  Big red flag there.  So while the actual age thing should not matter just be careful.  While my parents are 12 years apart they were not married until my mother was almost 30.  Good luck.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Hon,  sorry,  but  you  come  across  as  needy.  You're  too  anxious  to  step into  the  ex  gf's  place  and  be  whatever  it  was  that  she  was  to  him.  You're  giving  yourself  away  and  he's  not  ready  for  another  gf.  If  he  and  her  had  a  sexual  r/s,  then  that  is  all  he  might  want  from  you  and  that  is  a  pretty  shabby  arrangement.  He  needs  time  to  himself  to  recover.  Men  aren't  as  resilient  as  the  female  sex.  If  you  hook  up  with  him,  then  prepare  yourself  for  endless  conversations  all  about  her.  Me?  I  wouldn't  settle  for  such  scraps  'n  crumbs.  But...  your  call.|`|snpIRyRuaa	if u are both in love to each other then i guess your relationship is a very normal relationship. we are talking about love here not the age so ur relationship is normal. don't think about what other people would say. and i'm pretty sure whether u'll know what other people's comment u will still not stop seeing him ryt? this a free world. and age doesn't matter but love does.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal...love knows no age & since you're over 18 it's all good.|`|JnElq85taa	Okay, I see people telling you that the age difference isn't that big a deal, but I really think it is.  Well, actually, it depends -- what do you want him for?  Is this a fling, or do you think you might have as future with him?    I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 20.  That's less than HALF the age difference you're talking about and even we have problems with the age thing.  I'm not even talking about society; I'm just talking about logistics.  If you want a future with this man, it's going to be a difficult road.  By the time you're ready to get married and have kids, he'll probably be well into his 40s.  He might not want to "start over" at that age.  You two are just at completely different places in your lives.  He has way more life experience, knows more about how the world works, etc.  Even the most mature 18 year old would have a difficult time making this relationship work.  What could you two possibly have in common besides sex?  I'm not saying a true relationship is impossible, but it's really unlikely.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	To me, he's way too old for you!

When I was 37, I certainly wouldn't have had anything in common with an 18 year old.  Sorry.|`|6jHDwy1uaa	Well, if you don't care what people think why are you asking?

If he is not married or in a relationship anymore, then it should be okay. But take things slow. A guy with this much age difference may be expecting more than you may be ready to give. You should let things go where they're going to go and then if something starts up, you should keep things slow. If he really loves you, he'll wait for you to be ready for the sexual part of things.    Oh yeah, and you shouldn't let anything start if you still have a boyfriend. I kind of forgot that detail for a minute, but I'm sure you knew that. Also, be honest with your guy through all of this or you'll hurt him worse later.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	it not going to work out. your 18 and probably still in to clubs and pubs. he's 37 and probably likes watching the tv and staying in. you are both at different stages in your life. in the long run it wont work. SORRY.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	The age difference is a matter between you and the older guy. Most people have no problem with that contrary to what you stated. It is up to the ones involved. What I am hearing is that you may be the reason for his breakup. Even if you are unaware, most women in relationships don't appreciate a woman keeping company with their man. Especially a much younger woman. If society looked down on your relationship, if would be him they judged not you.|`|n8ESpa3oaa	Your both adults. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. But I do understand why your worried about what others would think. My advice? Date him. Don't tell others about your age difference. It's none of their business...Keep it between you and your man. You don't necessarily have to lie, but keeping that kind of information to yourselves will save your relationship from alot of stress and criticism.    All is fair in love and war!
adQWVOeAaa	I am also in college.    and I tell you what, I have made some of my best friends here by just finding someone eating alone and eating with them.     yeah, it seems lame... but it has worked for me.    Whenever I go to eat by myself between classes, I always look for a table that only has one person at it then sit a table or two away from him/her. then, if nobody joins after a few minutes and he/she isn't studying or anything, I just move over and ask if I can eat with them.    Sure, I have been declined many times... but usually if they are eating alone they truly do wish to sit with someone else. More often than not they will say yes.    It takes some guts, but can truly pull off.   heck, even if it is a table with a group of people... you can still ask to eat with them. What is the worst that can happen? they say no... big deal.
1dIapSoLaa	Nevermind sex and what everyone else is saying.  The best thing you could do for him to show him you love him is to do something with him he likes doing.  If he likes watchin certain types of movies that u dont normally agree on then maybe invite em over for a surprise movie and popcorn night. Or whatever he enjoys doing, I dont know your man so it's hard for me to say.  Monster truck rallys, hockey tickets, paintballing for the day, etc etc    Naturally whatever else you normally do can follow, but surprising him with something he loves and you normally wouldn't do is the best way!!!!    Take it from me!|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Put out|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	Guys understand actions, not words.    Get really naughty with him & blow his mind.  Then tell him that was his reward for being a good guy.  If you do it right, he'll work hard to earn that reward again ;-)|`|nsVbWXKraa	hardcore sex!!!!|`|UeCgFgucaa	give him special care moor then to Other people in front of his best friend|`|eKDYbe9Laa	write a letter to him|`|068LIR7eaa	Stop taking our frustrations out on him.|`|nA97uWdyaa	Seduce him.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Write him a love letter, sing him a love song...uhmmm...that's all I can think of.|`|NgpHScXnaa	tell him and show that u mean it.|`|nCrbKAuzaa	just spend time with him and let him feel that you value and cherish every moment you spend with him.because you know TIME is the best way in expressing your love to your BF nor this is the best way you can show your love.    WHAT KIND OF TIME?  - no cellphones when your together  - there's no hindrances in your moment  - just him and you      being with him and hugging him is enough my dear..    hope this will help you.    goodluck|`|WFxVuM1Laa	if your the chic in the picture, he's a lucky man. Get midevil on his ***, sex, sex, and more sex!!!! thats the best way to tell a guy you love him!!|`|9WHtStZNaa	You can have one of his friends take him out for an hour and when he gets back home have a beautiful dinner (top ramen works too lol) made for him. Once you guys eat dinner and talk for a while ask him to lay on his stomach and give him a massage. Tell him you are always there for him and act cute. Be kind of silly and flirty. But definitely let him know that you care by nurturing him.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	keep continue ur  appreciate with him he will understand that u really love him..|`|eYuIsNk1aa	If he has a Fantasy you know about do it for him.|`|NEglsYQAaa	do something romantic, some slow jams, nice dinner, candles, put yourself in something sexy you know spice it up a lil a man loves that stuff
1zwxspIAaa	You should try a gay bar and some spandex.|`|pBGzoqAiaa	You aren't bad looking but I know that being short shaves a couple points off of the attractiveness scale for women.  Not much you can really do for improvement on your looks, you aren't fat or have a bunch of acne.      I'm 5'8 on a good day and have been rejected because of my height.  The ones that rejected me were taller than me, and they said they wanted a guy who was "Tall, dark and handsome".  Well I'm short, pale, and handsome, 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  As a rejection mechanism, I just try and believe they are lesbians, it helps ease the blow a little bit.    I did once have a girl who was 5'9 like me, but I waited too long and she eventually went out with someone else.      All I can really tell you is be funny and outgoing, have a good job, stay in shape and don't give up because rejection happens to the best of us.      Good luck.|`|r0HYuHubaa	lol dont worri bowt it|`|QkvHCCJQaa	How about not being a flaming homo?|`|6boH5X5Baa	well number one and please do not take offence i don't like your hair and i could honestly say u should wear a hat not just to cover your hair but i really think u would look better and i think u should soften your face like relax it and smile at girls and make sure the smile is really sincere girls love killer smiles and its not height that matters|`|opjYENGGaa	There is nothing wrong with you. Why do you need to seek opinions from total strangers? Is your self-esteem that low? I wouldn't worry about being "cute" or "hot". Because not all girls only hit on a guy if he's hot. Personally, I wouldn't go for you due to you being waaay too short. I'm 181cm! Guys aren't the only ones who have problems. All of my friends are around your height and go for short guys. Try to smile and be nice.. try not to think of all of your flaws and think of what you DO have.|`|tpbt1bPKaa	You are very attractive the way you are.  I`d say just be yourself.
PDBJ7qPOaa	i love that he exists.....  wait no that's a lie.  damn  *cry* xP|`|2ctQUljUaa	one thing i really like is the way he makes me feel special.  he tells me i'm beautiful, calls me his babe or baby, and surprises me. i love surprises!|`|8uIfskigaa	He is very patient & caring & we just can talk about anything really & he makes me laugh but most of all he treats me with respect..early days yet but hoping & wishing :) xx    yes agree is lovely to get unexpected texts & phone calls, brightens up the day......|`|1zwxspIAaa	That she's a total milf.|`|KZCrNa7Zaa	Texts are awesome there's no doubt about that.  Especially waking up to a "Good morning, I love you" one.  But one thing I really like about my g/f is her passion for food.  As we're both cooks with aspiring dreams of Chefdom it's great to inspire eachother to keep striving for our dreams|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	I love everything about my Girlfriend (it's too hard to tell what I like most). She's simply too adorable & that's why I love her with all of my heart & soul.|`|6e5255ded4ce6695a2dc37936a4b039caa	*looks up*   I just Love....... everything about her    : ) xxxxx|`|JbqcXcVpaa	HeS A Basketball Player x.x|`|coQ3EPTbaa	i love that she matches my personality and style almost perfectly. i love her to bits!!!|`|gv7unj2Waa	that no matter what shes doing, she always calls and txt me and sees how im doing and to say she misses me.|`|dpCWHwUVaa	I love how she puts up with me!    More than that, I love thinking of a moment in time when we were getting a ride back from a party-I was sitting up, and she was lying down with her feet at the door and her head on a pillow that was on my lap...it was very cold outside, and it was a long ride, so we had tons of blankets.  She eventually got tired and fell asleep.  for the rest of the ride I just watched her sleep with a gentle smile on my face.  I kept on thinking how much she looked like an angel sleeping next to me. whenever I think of that moment I get a little sleepy from how comforting that thought of her is to me...I just love her so much.
BbRewQjQaa	Girls at a club are looking for the same thing you and friends are.|`|EHCM324Faa	If their keen or not they still would go out|`|eNEgKxfJaa	just because they go out doesnt mean they are fair game.     what your basically saying is if they have boyfriends they wouldnt go out on a girls night or summing?    no thats not right. talk to them sure, socialise sure. but dont just assume that they are fair game.|`|2iDvyoXhaa	That's fine. But make sure you come with your A game (and money for drinks) because club girls can be vicious, lol.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Yes any woman is fair game.    Any resepctable woman who was taken would be at home taking care of her husbands needs. Like my wife does.|`|wSWNjKxXaa	Girls go out to dance or drink and socialise, Not all are looking for a man.
UinOWcMUaa	God Bless your heart.. brother !! Well, you know simply put it, just wait for the perfect timing. Being that I'm a psych major girls like it when your cool and confident. Smile when you see her but let her dig you, just play cool and keep it simple, When the opportunity arises just strike up a normal conversation with her. The smile may be nice, but she may have some issues you don't know about. Anyways.. if she pans out to be ok, just ask to see if she wants to study sometime, maybe do the whole starbucks thing :) You know.. anyways..hoped it helped you out !    take care..|`|GTwVNeHraa	If you'll go back to that engineering class, try sitting next to her, talk about what projects you're doing there and hers, give more compliments, and then she might strike up a conversation, because girls start to think about guys differentally when they get compliments. Eventually, you'll become friends, ask her out to go get a drink at Starbuck's or something, and it will be kinda like a date.|`|blA81Wi6aa	omg...first bad step your about to do...dont do it!  don't start off as friends. Trus me. I am a girl and can't stand it when a guy flirts and tries to be my friend, and makes me believe that is all he wants. It makes the girls feel like they got the signals the guy was setting out all mixed up and the guys wasnt trying to flirt.   Here is what will prob happen...u and girl become friends..then she gets taken by another (faster than u think, especially if her smile is as pretty as u say) and then ur chance will be put on hold. and when its ur turn to ask her out, she is confused and only thinks of you as a friend!!  Just ask her straight up the next time you see her and ask her if she wants to get to no you better..........that sentance right there is an opening to a new relationship..or potential relationship, letting her no ur interested    Im in my own situation right now, where one of my bestfriends that i met during the summer jsut told me he wants to be with me. I find it wierd and dont no how to tell him. I did like him when i first met him, but now i just think of him as a close friend,,and i would never want to lose him..and if we break up, i lose him    so think about it man!|`|PXkFFOYKaa	ask to borrow something    give her a compliment    ask a question about an assignment    hold open a door ( she WILL notice you, TRUST me :) )    notice something about her and ask her about it (if she has a team sweatshirt, be like "so you like the lakers/ cowboys/ red sox, or if she has a cast on her leg "how did you hurt your leg?" etc)    if one day she has a new hairstlye, compliment her on that          if she is carrying something heavy, offer to help her!    if she drops something, help her pick it up instead of staring down her shirt while she picks it up (this happened to me, I dropped my folder and everything fell out, 10 guys stared at my cleavage and 1 really shy guy helped me clean up my stuff and smiled at me without saying anything and I was instantly attracted to him)        next time you see her, slap her a hi five and say hi.    if you are watching a movie in class or at a sporting event, casually comment about it. (in drivers ed, this guy I had never noticed, was like, "this guy is a real tool", and we had a ten minute roast of this dumb movie and we instantly clicked!)    I know this is long but I hope it helps!, all of these would work on me and I am very picky about my men
9EdJHqKHaa	Too keep it short and sweet, men don't wife girls like that. If he cared about her he wouldn't tolerate her having skank pictures up online. I hate myspace. It's a sorry excuse to flaunt BS like that... anyway, I wouldnt worry about her. She wont be around long. Besides, the child is half yours so you have every right to lay down the law as to who will or will not be around your baby. If he tries to argue with you over it, use the girls myspace page as your ammunition as to why she is unfit to be around your baby.|`|cnCnSsWraa	step mother bullshit he only got 1 mother and its you.                               you know guys eventually get tired of slutty girls i know this for sure i am a guy maybe he last some months maybe a year but no more i would not date some girl i met in myspace and i know no guy ho respect himself will at least forever. try to look someone more who interest you in a sexual aspect but please do not look in myspace.                              cause you cannot be forever paranoid about your x husband new gf          why you care if she knows about u your the 1 who got a kid with him so your the main character in this movie if you understand me don't feel guilty of some myspace whore just don't be ether good or bad with her just be. cause probably she is jealous off you and you can't even notice bb just find someone else to hang out and share and forget about this girl and if you still like him just wait and see i am sure he will dump her eventually=) and do not give importance to her slutty comments WHY CAUSE THEIR ARE SLUTTY AND SHE IS MAKING HERSELF LOOK LIKE A SLUT SOOOOOOOOO.|`|hOUEIEmBaa	You screwed him and got knocked up does that make you a slut?|`|MhvwRwNKaa	Of course! She's nothing but a slutty fling! I would'nt loose sleep over this if i were you|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Sounds like a phase that he's going through...men are pigs...even if we love them...Since he is the daddy of your baby...this guy will be in your life forever and ever..this girl that he is in lust with...will only last a brief time...this time next yr...he'll probably forget her name|`|Ci3Efibkaa	Jealous??     Can't have topless photos on myspace    You're pretty much a stalker    how can you judge her if you got yourself knocked up? maybe she'll make him wear a condom or two|`|vpvZ6Dwcaa	i think its the way the slut dresses
KwkEvmpPaa	I really don't think it's going to last at all she seems like a total slut with no dignity he probably is just using her and wants to do her but keep an eye out and I hope your not letting your baby be around this slut        Good Luck

I told him that you were looking for him so hes on his way now to see you.
W2Qegyrqaa	brotha, i don't think they relly know. not a woman just had to throw that one out there|`|OG3lycSPaa	a best friend, a kind sympathizer, a person to hang out with and go out and have fun with, someone who cares for me and loves me, someone who forgives me and is patient, someone who is bold and has strong convictions, someone I can care for and love, someone I can forgive and try to be patient with, someone I can respect and admire. You know just a simple honest relationship.|`|LIsdyrKYaa	its more like what would you like out of a relationship/marriage like example both men and woman who are in any type of relationship it could be marriage or a very serious relationship would want the same things. love and being cared for,honesty,trust, being a friend and a lover someone who they can count on someone who would understand them and take their time with them, being your self its very simple  and just having a good time with them.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	To be held, listened to, loved unconditionally, and be shown passion.|`|f2b9bac6ba2f1b4719753cb0987d5d4faa	Love, kids and financial security.|`|75SSAFsPaa	love, honesty, caring, but not too overbearing|`|nCrbKAuzaa	well it's not a want but a need. what we need is just simple.  we just need your time guys. spending your time with us is enough. letting us know that you love us and respect us. because you know what time is the bestitest gift that you'll ever give to a girl.|`|ise05jjUaa	The day I figure this out, lets just say I'd be richer than Bill Gates!  You know a lot of women say they pretty much want the same thing, but as time goes on they change they're minds & want something else.  I don't think they really know what they want.
6e3e13dad52401635f135a72ce217f23aa	I don't see any difference with the profession of the person in a relationship..it is depend on the two person how they will run their life together.|`|USsDzaIsaa	Marines are trained to act without questioning authority.

WBVw1SK0aa	Coming from a woman, we have this Prince Charming imagined and we just want that, we  realize you guys won't always ride up on your white horse but we want you to be kind and tell us how gorgeous we are all the time.

We've all grown up filled with this concept of finding our perfect soul mate who's loving, caring, sensitive, pretty, and everything else we can wish for. This concept is ingrained into our minds as we grow up by media like Disney. Then we waste a good portion of our adult of lives trying to fulfill this fantasy dream to only be disappointed.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	I don't expect anyone to be perfect.   I'm not perfect neither is my OH, we accept each other "warts & all".

I have regrets & mistakes I'm sure men do too. Women just want men to put a lot of effort into being better. If they got on your case about something in the past or what not devote time & attention to the girl and she'll be fine. She just wants to have reassurance you like her more.|`|f0vdBz2iaa	Haha... I think this is a very general statement/question.  I've experienced the same thing from the reverse, being the female.  Ever notice how women look perfect in commercials, yet men can be average?  I think it something that some do, and some don't.  I don't expect men to be perfect... it really depends on the person.  Sounds like you've been interacting with more immature females....|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	If you except mine I except yours, short of breaking law's of course.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	They expect you to be the "Mr. Right" they're looking for in their life.
udjwMqj5aa	Because you love him?
0swcJtkqaa	call her everyday. communication is key to any relationship. try to spend as much time as you can with her even doing little things like going to the store or stay at home and watch movies with popcorn.Always be affectionate with her like hugs, holding hands, kissing, etc. Everyonce in a while bring her flowers or roses or small gifts. When she is sick try to cater to her every needs. Treat her family like they are your own.Small compliments here and there like "your beautiful" and "i love your smile". Also try to show emotion and feelings with her.( i know that might be a hard one). And lastly if you gotten to that point yet the famous three words "i love you" , and dont just say it at the end of a conversation , say it randomly. try to follow all these and you should have yourself a healthy long lasting relationship.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	jo start good and posetive actions with women ...... and for strong relationship gift and sharing happiness and sorrow are more importent...........|`|ThfHrcc4aa	Take her out and show her a good time and make her feel important.

Tell her how great she is but not too much, compliment her and just be you.|`|6boH5X5Baa	always be honest u can tell her anything and have some self confidence but don't get cocky girls hate that listen to her and be understanding|`|blirKov3aa	it need time to prove that u are right,so u should be honest more often,time proves all|`|kbES1CKaaa	I would say doing  simple gestures goes a long way like opening the door for her while she gets in the car door or any nice place; taking her coat off for her when you both go to a restaurant or esp.to any fancy place. Remember, it's imp. to be consistent on this. And making sure her needs are met, by asking her if she's ok with this or that. Just don't ask this too many times for it might backfire on you.
f0vdBz2iaa	Basically, as you get older people only really celebrate the landmark birthdays like when you're technically an adult, when you're 20, 30, etc.  More often than not, if you want to do something for your birthday, you have to plan it yourself.  And then once you have kids then it's more about them than yourself.  (I'm 26 with two kids under 5).|`|c7UC1Fgeaa	they be come just another day. the  excitement soon dies away|`|aaMVZ03Laa	for me it used to be fun when i was younger then 16 after that it wasn't fun it just feels like it's just another normal day and then u start thinking about ur future and all this other things u never used to worry about before and it sucks that the same excitement u used to have to open presents blow the birth day candle is not there no more.i just turned 24 and it wasn't that exciting so don't feel bad it's part of life and we all have to get older and mature.hope this helps|`|mxrlZEweaa	After your 21st birthday, there is no excitement. Then you just celebrate your 30th, 40th, etc. Basically you get a birthday every 10 years instead of every year. But I love birthdays so my kids will always get a celebration, no matter how old they are.     HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY!!!!
dJUaACflaa	Listen to "Mike M" and "Yay" - good sound advice.    He sounds like a gentleman. Just becareful with your choice - if you make a move on this other crush, there is a good chance this nice guy will shy away - if he's like what I'm picking, he won't want to be "just another guy" to you.    Working these things out is half the fun (and torture) of life and growing up. I was never good at picking it up, still suck at it haha - but I have a lovely girlfriend now. We both went through the "I wonder if he/she likes me" - sometimes you just have to play it by ear...that's what's fun about romance - it should never be straight forward! And believe me, if it all works out, it's all worth it.    All the best...|`|xkgcYeXPaa	If all i have to do is open a door to get you attracted then I will open the gates of hell itself!|`|3PlT64Yuaa	Tyler, that's a horrible thing to say. You discredit the gentlemen that do quietly exist when you make such a statement.     As for the question, why don't you ask the guy yourself? If he is truly nice to EVERYONE, then he won't try to avoid you after you ask, if he says no. What have you got to lose?    You should know though that having multiple crushes at the same time is always trouble. But, that's probably another question.|`|rurfFLDkaa	guys are never nice unless they want to get pooty|`|3jFm0rWdaa	If that is your photo then as cute as you are I'm sure he does.  You have a crush on this other guy then that is the guy you really like! You have to try that one and if it doesn't work out then you know to give the other relationship a chance.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Well, the only way to do is ask him.    And if he doesent, than ask the other guy.    But im sure he does    Because Im nice 2 everyone especially girls but Idk I find a way to translate to the woman that I like her    usually like    "I like you" lol|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	polygamy is legal there in ur place?|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Make up your mind..

So think about it very good.|`|Uv7onQaQaa	how old are you?|`|6oVPitDuaa	Sounds like to me hes gay......|`|rd5468H1aa	No, he could just be trying to have good manners. If he treats everyone the same way, then he probably doesn't like you. Just go after that other guy that you've been crushing on.|`|8IxC4MAyaa	Tyler has no idea, first of all.     Anyway, I would say the guy likes you. Either he's just extremely nice or he has a crush on you too, but maybe is to shy to tell you. That sounds exactly like me. I am polite and very kind to everyone and, but if I like someone, I try to be by them as much as possible. My problem is, I have no idea if they like me and am too shy to find out so I just don't ask.     Give it a shot and ask him to go to a movie or something or when he's around and your hungry, Just say I'm hungry...wanna go get something to eat?

c2YcBbXyaa	i know people who have this problem and it gets really bad....you have to get her some professional counseling or learn to live with it...i personally can't stand being in houses like that....it's too claustrophobic...i'd have to leave|`|AA10628838	Time to realize she has a compulsive behavior problem.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	tell her gently that you two should both sort out your things together and keep cherished thing not every meaningless thing. also tell her that you cant ever buy her nice things because theres not enough room for them because of all her nic nacs.|`|BbRewQjQaa	A lot of people have this issue the best way to deal with it is say that you want to save money and set up an allowance for both of you. This will reduce her shopping and help develop better spending habits also  have a yard sale.|`|uNVOPkruaa	if it comes down to it just start randomly taking  things here and there when she's not around and put them in a box somewhere. if she really has THAT much stuff , she probably wouldn't even notice :p  having nic nacs and stuff all over would drive me crazzzyy, ahah

The only thing I would like to say is..you both need to learn how to deal with you problems in a different way...you must know violence is not the answer and it's not fair on the children...when he comes back you both need to get a baby sitter and then you need to go somewhere quite and talk about your problems...not fight but talk...then come up with a plan to resolve these issues between you...life will be much easier for both of you , when you learn how to communicate. Communication is the key to a successful marriage...if you do this every hour , every day, every week, every month, every year, then your marriage will stand a better chance of being successful.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	Divorce, you are both abusive. You will make it on your own. Now is the time to make changes before you end up in jail for spousal abuse.|`|KncPJwIaaa	If you call the cops you know you going to jail so hopefully hes just cooling of for your sake cause this is a serious matter you got kids so either you and get your **** right or separate but im banking on him just cooling off and think before you react next time it might be worst than it is now and for the kids sake you both will go to jail and some child services will be getting your kids hey im just painting that picture and be in honest cause you flirting with disaster|`|u00IalCZaa	Honestly I do . Give it until morning or 24 hours later and report it.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	i am sure he will be back for another beating from you|`|zokJMPBAaa	it was good while you two were dating after marriage it was all downhill  in your case|`|BbRewQjQaa	Take a breather and relax you two need to see a marriage counselor since you two are getting violent with each other. Second I do not think he left he is probably giving you time to cool down and his self to cool down. If he does not contact you with in the next two days you may want to contact the police and file a missing persons report.|`|qX4J6SmIaa	"Love is never having to say you're sorry".  It means that you should never do anything against a loved one that you have to say sorry for.  Also, you shouldn't be physical with him and not expect something back.  Just b/c you're the weaker one doesn't mean that you're the innocent one.  I'm sorry to say this but it looks like the marriage is already over.  Honestly, do what's best for the kids and for you both......divorce and maybe you can concentrate on yourself and your kids well being and happiness.|`|9qwBeYCQaa	Go to a relatives. Get away from him.  Obviously you both have issues. Sorry, but it's the truth. I'm not perfect either. It's not healthy for any of you. You will manage. Child support, alimony and you can probably get help from the state til you get on your feet full time. It just sounds like it's not working out for either of you.

wF2G3Krcaa	Okay I have this same ongoing issue with my husband. I am 40 lbs heavier now than when I met him and he really wants me to be the way I was when we met. Basically he looked at my stomach and kinda just came out and asked me, have you gained weight? I'm really sensitive but I knew he was tryng to be nice. He quit buying fatty foods and asked me to start working out with him. It worked... and no one was hurt in the process.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	tell her nobody likes fat people|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Join a gym and ask her to go with you and start helping her cook making healthy meals and then take nice long walks after dinner.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	The question is... Is it for her health or for her beauty. If you are asking for her beauty, then you will definitely hurt her feelings. If you are truly concerned about her health, then you should diet with her. Go to the gym with her or buy a treadmill and work WITH her. If you are just instructing her to stop eating or to eat healthier or to be more active, then it will hurt her feelings. You need to support her every step of the way and work with her right from square one.|`|1ZGZeW7Zaa	Tell her you want to jog , and would love it if she joined you. make that into a routine. maybe go to the gym together?just have fun with it!|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Take her out on moonlit strolls out bicycling; everything you do will be exercise body friendly included. And for an extra boost include some fat burning foods, which should be added to your diet. You don't even have to tell her what you're up to.|`|AA11996507	You can either "advise her to lose weight" or you can avoid hurting her feelings.  You can't do both.|`|YYc5gqGlaa	how bout you suggest both goin to work out in the gym, as a couple thing. That would help both of you.|`|4b273ea1bcd18de731e487c9a11bbc44aa	Maybe you should suggest working out together and eating healthier foods. Be in it together, tell her its better for both your health.|`|uNVOPkruaa	you could go on a diet with her.  tell her that you want to lose some weight and get healthy and just say it might be fun and easier if you's did it together. you's could eat healthier meals and maybe go for walks or something. that way it wouldn't be so hurtful to her, she would think she was helping you out. it's a lot easier to lose weight and keep motivated if you have someone doing it with you :)|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Don't tell her, just provide a good example by excersing regularily by yourself, and invite her to join you.    If you set a good, regular example she will feel more inclined to follow your lead.|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	Do you think she likes to be fat? If shes overweight she obviously doesn't need you to "advise" her about it.      Maybe when she says something about it tell her you will work out and go on a diet with her. Then she doesn't feel like crap and you can support her.|`|AA10075228	Your wife probably knows that she needs to lose weight.  There is no easy way to tell someone you love that they are too fat.  Go to a counselor for help on this, as it is bound to be very difficult for both of you to understand.  You probably could consult your doctor and he may be able to suggest people to go to that would help you both with this problem.  Are you a large person also?|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	Hey honey .....lets start to eat a bit healthier and wanna start talking walks before diner...     But be careful you are treading in some unsafe territory here!|`|9NwPPYXZaa	Go to the gym and invite her to go also. make things that can help her loose weight like a funtime...|`|AA12014364	Start exercising with her. Start slow and very gradually increase your pace. Start with morning or evening walks. Then move onto jogging and then slowly move into the gym. Make her understand that you are concerned about her health.|`|Z614I2Yaaa	YOU SOUND LIKE A NICE GUY PLAN A WONDERFUL EVENING WALK AROUND THE PARK AND A GREAT SALAD DONT GIVE ANY IDEAS YOU WANT HER TO LOSE WEIGHT...DONT EVEN MENTION IT INSTEAD BRAG WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME YOU HAD TOGETHER..DO IT ABOUT 3 TIMES A WEEK..YOU WILL NOTICE CHANGE PHISICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY ON BOTH PARTS..GOD BLESS|`|E56MF3p6aa	Tell her that you love good figured women and that you want to see her in good shape.|`|9qwBeYCQaa	Just tell her that you are concerned. Changing the way you eat would be beneficial to both of you. Maybe try that. Maybe she should have her thyroid checked. That is to blame for weight gain a lot of times. Exercise together. Take the dog for a walk. Drink a lot of water, and drink diet soda. That helps tremendously.
ZIdhNsxPaa	Everyone likes a different "type". I have male friends that love big women, others that like very thin ones. Some don't care about a girl's face and have one particular body part they go nuts for, like legs, feet, or butt. Your acne will go away, that isn't apart of you. And you sound like a nice girl. Your young, give yourself some time to develop completely. Pretty, model like girls in high school normally end up losing their beauty and the ones with the rough edges (like acne etc.) End up being the knock outs in college.|`|a759042489672e78a2c3702afb3f5daaaa	You seem like a really cool and nice person. But you are only 14 and tons of time to grow so i wouldn't worry about looking for guys.|`|0d9f44b98b2ff8442aba13a7852d6391aa	Our judgment means nothing. If you like who you are then that is all what matters. I know you might not even read this to the end but trust me when your older you will know. Its not all about looks. but if looks give the confidence you need then so be it. Change what you could at the moment for example IF YOU FEAL over weighted  or a bit chubby. Then start a long run diet and maybe walk more. Dress up every once in wile. Try to look your best every time you leave the house. But in the end you will find someone that thinks like you and have similar personalty. Again I will tell you that people's judgment means nothing.|`|mZj5dASuaa	Hey you're only 14, don't stress! You have plenty of time...firstly you'd grow out of the acne. If you love reading and art then you probably aren't dumb meaning you have a little more than shoes and make up to talk about to a guy. People on yahoo answers don't know you, haven't met you and probably will never meet you so what we say can't be all that accurate. Don't change yourself according to what people will like, you'll never be able to please everybody so just be yourself, one day you'll find a guy who'll love you for that!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Personality wise - sounds intriguing    But - too young - alas.|`|nCrbKAuzaa	hi kitty. well i found you very interesting. well we have same likeness like talking to people and listen to them. i'm not that judgemental and i dont judge people easily. well if yo want to be my friend you may email me. i'm open in evrything.|`|5p9vQSdtaa	enjoy life. u r 2 young to be worrying in these things?|`|lMeoMz8Aaa	sure :)   remember theres someone right for everyone, including you!|`|BRnYseFKaa	from what ive read, of course. but you didnt list any of your faults? that makes it hard to decide because i know your good qualities, obviously you seem cool then. what are your bad qualities personality wise?|`|zokJMPBAaa	sweetheart at that age you should be thinking of finishing high school go to college,get a degree and  if poosible go as far as getting a phd. a good job ,and find a nice husband  to enjoy life with,to be honest this question should never be posted,we only help people this is not a dateline or do you want me to say 20/20 late nite|`|fL0yQmmLaa	acne dosent worry me cause it will go away   depends how chubby but besides that you sounds really nice|`|HxKCvUb9aa	well your14 so even if your ot happy with how you look now your gonna look completely different when your 16    Just be you no matter what
xA1uSaZPaa	No need to feel stupid, afterall it's only a crush.    Getting over someone can be hard to do depending on how much you really liked them. Some good ways to get over a guy is not to think about them a lot. Even though it sounds hard, it'll work over time. Another good way to get over someone is to put you mind onto other things. Try going into sports, a hobby, an afterschool activities, talking to your friends more. (: Hoped I help|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It's good that you just like him and don't feel your in love with him.  Crushes are relatively easy to get over.  Put him out of your mind and don't do anything that reminds you of him until you are able to perform the task without thinking about him.  Remember honey, if they were meant to feel good it wouldn't be referred to as a crush.|`|E6kJE2x2aa	find sum1 new|`|MMvoS6Ysaa	i know how u feel love but just sit wid urself put ur feelings aside n start thinking wid ur mind (not heart) think of the things this guy wud do to u if u were ever together, think if ur willing to handle the pain n u know how this relationship's going to end (not very good I'll tell u) just try to move on u'll find sum1 sum day , sum1 u truly deserve keep urself occupied n soon u'll wonder y u even liked him  God bless!|`|5s90en0iaa	i've been there babygirl and i know it's hard to get over someone. it's really cliche but you will get over him in time and at the right time...you can't change how you feel about someone...that has to come naturally. you deserve a man who will go out of their way to get your attention and be with you...he'll come along. don't wory so much about finding a boyfriend because he'll come along when u least expect it!|`|M2JNgbI1aa	find someone new ;)  good luck hun|`|cbvRRZ5Oaa	thats how i felt about this one guy i went out with.  it took me about 1-2 months to finally realize he wasnt worth my time.  trust me you'll get over him.  yea i know its hard  but suck it up  it has to rain before theres a rainbow :)|`|5kXe739Naa	aw, i do that alot..     i like a guy, then  i watch to see how hes with other girls. I decided i liked him, and my bff told me she liked him.. so i backed off.. its fine    there's lots more fish in the sea... tho i just tell myself he obviously wasn't meant for me.. if he was meant for me then something would have come out of it. Find a new crush,,., if u stil like him.. force yourself to get over him.. its better for your friend and you|`|gduUlcXoaa	I don't think it is a good idea to force yourself to stop liking someone, that's quite impossible. In time you will get over him. Have patience and one day you'll wake up without thinking about him at all. Meanwhile stay out of contact and try very hard to ignore his existence. Distract yourself with good stuff like hanging out with friends etc.     Remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea! He's just one guy in billions, and he's not even that great.    Good luck and hope this helps!
enBBnABnaa	pick and choose your times to tease, and make sure it's not a time she will choke.  since she is asking you to keep up with the jokes, she's not worried about it, so just forget it!|`|BRnYseFKaa	you should feel good that you saved her life, not the other way around :)|`|dHASHX0paa	Hotdogs. The silent killer.|`|Jmy6kA1Xaa	You can never talk to her again.  Now that you have saved her life, you are infinitely cooler than her, and it would just be way too awkward.  Save yourself the embarrassment and stay away from her.|`|pHbVh9kIaa	i guess u should be watching wen ever u r making jokes, i mean she could have been killed, but now u r also her hero for saving he life so dont worry too much and tell her how sorry u r and make onther day with her and dont make mistakes so u will be all right then!
bvwYVGJOaa	Honey you are intelligent and grounded person,not naive and gullible, enough to know you had it coming to you, the whole break up thing, so i would let it go if i were you.     I know you were really close to him and you feel he might reveal stuff to people or use them against you but i wouldn't really think he would but his girl-friend might and she might have been jealous of you and him together and felt you were gonna take him away from her so it was like that for her.     He's also a momma's boy and probably clinged onto her since he was a baby but but, we all love our mums ok! but this wouldn't be a good relationship for you because he will end up relying on his mum for everything and maybe making decisionsfor him when he can do it himself. There would have been more problems created as well between you and his girl-friend causing troubles. But this relationship did ended in a somewhat good way because now you don't have to think or hassle about things and     You'll be fine dont feel dirty and stupid you didnt have sex ok? You still got a chance to find that special someone to make love with and spend time with. He was only your first boyfriend not everyone is perfect for each other, we all go through ups and downs even my sister who's been in a on/off like a switch current relationship with her boyfriend and told me to wait for someone to get married with cos its a waste of time to be with someone who's not worth the time.    good luck on everything you do in life and forget that momma's boy andget urself a real man! x|`|sI5TPJ2laa	Wow. first cut is the deepest.I've been there only SHE dumped me and i got too attached and then i saw her at the movies with another guy 4 days after.And it was the most horrible pain ever and i also started talking to her friends to keep my mind of it and that's what he's doing.He's trying to make an effort to move on and in a way Ur friends are his rebound.So first off(i know it'll be hard but i promise it help).......NO CONTACT.....DELETE PHOTO'S!! and no asking his friends what he's up too.This was so similar to my situation.And if you know where he's gonna be or if you know he's gonna be in a photo on face book DON'T LOOK!! Because i promise you one day you'll end up seeing something you don't want to see.LIFE moves on and the world keeps turning.i know this hurts and it will for a while.Take this as a learning experience.The most positive things about this is that your biggest heartbreak(1st)is over and this will make you stronger.Go out with friends and meet new people and if you want him back?? Get photos with other guys and just have fun and he'll probably come around but don't get your hopes up OK?Live your life you have every right to as a human being GOOD LUCK!! chin up any other questions send me an email derekk1992@yahoo.ca
jLHYCNXZaa	Im usually able to conceal it pretty well, just tuck it upwards and its hardly even noticeable lol.    Its usually pretty noticeable in any other direction...|`|4hJJkfmpaa	depends on what pants he is wearing. Jeans don't but other would probaly|`|d68fcba8d2d9be865acddf103d499bd1aa	It is not easy and you may not have to look at his pants.    Most guys can't hide the look on their face (as it is extremely embarrassing in public) never mind in their pants.    As you might imagine, trying to hide a roll of quarters or a hotdog or italian sausage isn't easy, neither is having one of the most sensitive parts or the body fill up to that size suddenly, your increased blood flow and the thoughts that got you there easy to hide either.    Some guys can think there way out of it and make it go back down, but again it is usually evident on there face if you really look there first.    Baggy pants and tightys help this a bit too, but you have to be real cool to hide the face.    Enjoy!|`|z7JsVzcnaa	There are tricks that can help, but not really.|`|5uUSJNSLaa	lol, somehow this question is hilarious.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Not when they hug you...
5njUybcjaa	Depends on how long I've been friends with the married ones. Some I have known from before they were married, so I still treat them the same. He should never hide the fact that he talks to other females at work, because if he does hide it, it normally means there is something to hide...

Are you having weird dreams, if so, your mind may be trying to tell you what is wrong.  Maybe if you identify that you can find out what is going on.  Good luck.|`|JmMrgtGqaa	You realy need to go to the doctor. whatever problem you have sounds serious.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Go to the doctor ASAP!|`|8wi2X5sSaa	i think u have an eating disorder. that probably caused the loss of sleep and stuff. well, thats what i think.  u should eat even though ur not hungry and get more rest. (i think)|`|GZCmyzBYaa	stress? your icon thing says your engaged mabye that it?
81J81DGqaa	Well, if he made you sad, accept friends offer. I mean you won't beat him up and you didn't give order to beat him, your friends wanted to, so I would accept an offer. I really would, because it happened the same to me, but didn't had any friend to beat that other guy.     On the other hand, leave the girl and the guy alone. It's not worth it. Go on with your life. You will be sad for some months now, but then you will forget everything. You will see that there are million more girls out there.     Your choice.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	First of all, you should hold on to this girl very tightly! Don't ever let her leave you just because of this guy! =D And tell your friends that they shouldn't whack the fellow, they will get into deep trouble! I think you should sit down with your girl and have a good talk with her! Have a nice talk and things will go smoothly! Good luck! =D|`|U8oR3VU6aa	It sounds like she is not as serious as you or she is unsure of how she feels at this point. It is better to let her go and take a chance than to always wonder if she wanted him. I would tell her to go try it out and get it out of her system. If not, it will keep coming up. I think if she went to him, she would realize it if she loves you. That way, you know she chose you over him in the end. But don't come off sounding pouty or whiny  or even pissed. Be firm and tell her to go to him and see if that is what she wants. I bet she'll come back and with a lot more respect for you.|`|H9G8y1acaa	Oh hell, don't let these guys go and ruff up this dude. That's just going to great legal problems and make you look like a jerk to this girl. It sounds like she's going to stick with you so I would tell her that its me or him which sounds like you already have. If it's really going this well with the girl take it to the next level so this stuff won't happen again.
EALy7X7Gaa	not at all i think its simple and cute! :D|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	no|`|MOMb0Amoaa	no its ok|`|uNVOPkruaa	i don't think it's trashy at all !  it's cute and small and can easily be covered up if you want ! :)  goo for it :) xx|`|5pGfmlxcaa	yea   its a tramp stamp|`|cl6r8cGBaa	ive seen the pic but..uhm.. where's the trashy part?|`|ku6CnsV8aa	i find it really hot when girls tattoos in that place. dont know why you want that one though|`|YYc5gqGlaa	no, that girl is though. It would look really good. go for it.|`|W2Qegyrqaa	no, it's nice. small, i don't like when a woman has huge tats|`|sQIcCVjAaa	I've seen trashy, and that my dear is not trashy! You don't have to worry about that|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	Any tattoo in that area is considered a "tramp stamp". Don't do it. Tattoos are seriously not worth the trouble.
15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	With an ex, the rule is either you get back together and try to continue whatever was the way of life before or you stop seeing each other. There is no way you can see each other and still not try to claim each other or not try to butt in each other's lifestyle.|`|Qb8Jmwj5aa	yeah i agree no sex cuzz then he would think u as a booty call. i remind myself to control my horomones|`|1hciyvKdaa	He only wants sex, move on.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	i agree with Cuz.  No sex.  He may just miss that, give it time to see if its more.|`|wUkU3HVwaa	NO SEX
nMzC1qZTaa	He's still interested. Lots of signs are in your post about why he would be and missing you.Just be more careful this time and try to figure out why he dumped you the first time so it won't happen again.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	booty call!!!!!!|`|zokJMPBAaa	it took him that long to find a way to get away from the lady he was  seeing after you,yes move on have his tv setting out front|`|ME7540ZBaa	Send him his TV in his place and dont let him in to your apartment.move on!!!
iKUnaAlfaa	u get what u give...dogs stay away from people who are afraid because dogs sense fear...u gotta hug them and stop feeling depressed...your letting your "attitude" hold you back from gettin love|`|fZw6ImUGaa	I can relate to that. For some guys it's a natural thing to be attractive, others have to work hard at it. And you can do that, it works. Get a book about how to learn flirting or really communication in general and plan what you want to do and what you want to avoid in the future. I was like you but in my late 20s I managed to relax, see it as a game, undertsnad the rules and apply them.|`|hBbgjasQaa	Be brave and start with ugly and under status girls. It will give u confidence and make u popular amongst others.|`|BGtkSLaKaa	so do something about it.|`|7U8nhijRaa	maybe you need to personally go up to some and start a chat with them girls like talkers|`|rH4eUC9Baa	Sorry, but you're gonna have to put some effort into building relationships and maintaining them before getting any 'action' from members of the opposite sex; they don't go up to complete strangers and talk/hug/etc. It's a two-way street, bro..|`|Q3vY0r8yaa	maybe you seem too shy to the girls..try to be more out there..i knw when im around a group of guys i usually pay more attention to the guys who are more loud,talkitive and friendly..but im always more interested in the guy who isnt out there..but im too scarred to go up to him cuz he seems so quite..did i spell that right..oh well..but ya just try to be more outgoing..but not to much cuz then us girls r gnna think ur a weirdo..lol..i wish u luck!!|`|DtVMrNvNaa	honestly that's prob why... girls like out going guys. i'm sure you have something interesting to say to them. start up a conversation about a recent movie or anything tha interests you! also act very confident!!! as if you dont care... act kinda like an asshole!! the more confident you are and the more girls you'll get! the girls prob talk to your friends because your friends talk to them first. so just get involved in their conversations too|`|vwi7KRgFaa	Dude, you gots to chill.      You ever think they don't engaged you as much because they don't know you as well as your friend.  Your gonna have to step up and talk to them.    I understand that you feeling a little exiled and unaccepted, and engaging them in some conversation is a good way to get them to warm up to you.    Like in dating, women expect men to make the 1st move, so make it.
S4QBvAaGaa	I haven't read it but maybe they either like a challenge or they enjoy being enslaved.  Good Luck! :)|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	if your talking about the"attitude" its a turn off. thats why we use the word *****. coz we hate those attitudes.    if its a slut, then thats lovely.|`|6F32sfLeaa	because men are dogs.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	I read a book which mentioned it :D  Just as a one-time thing, I suppose.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	hummm because men use bitches for sex and time passing...|`|iKUnaAlfaa	LoL...men dont love bitches, they want sex...for every 10 girls a man ask "lets have sex" 9 girls will say no!  for every 10 guys a girl asks "lets have sex" 9 guys will say yeah!  If your a good girl, don't get jealous of "bitches", men use them for sex, your betta than that...and if you consider yourself as one of the bitches, you can always change and men will love you for who you are.....you shoudn't think that way that "men love bitches"...unless you meant female dogs, who doesn't love dogs|`|5p9vQSdtaa	as bitches are easily available|`|1ModQeRjaa	Because all the fun is in the chase and to win over a *****, you have to be a bigger *****.    But, no, I don't care for them.
6SB4ufEYaa	She's afraid      When people put you down and abuse you for long enough, you start to believe that they do it because you really are that terrible to be around.    She may worried about you doing the same to her. If her family can treat her that way.. what makes you any different. If her family hate her... what makes you so different.. you know?    Or maybe she doesn't want you to get close to her, and then see her as what she thinks she is.. worthless. Her self esteem is probably really low.    Just persevere. She's probably worth it.|`|1gPJO37qaa	I had the same problem. Give it time if you like her. Be prepared for a very jealous, competitive girlfriend, but also very caring and loving|`|EALy7X7Gaa	she just normally feels like she doesnt deserve you because she feels like crap because of what has happened to her she feel unworthy. Let her know how much you care for her and if anyone it was you who didnt deserve her tell her how incredible she is and that you really want to make this work.|`|QDrAGIOeaa	She either:     1.) Believes that she is not good enough, and cares about someone enough to know that she will be a drain on their life. The sad truth about this, sometimes when they think that they will bring you down, they will one way or another. I believe there is hope for everyone, but there is barely a little for some (might be set up to lose)    2.) She is using this as a lame excuse because she doesn't want to date you, for whatever reason.|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	it means shes not that into you but doesn't want to hurt your feelings cause you're such a great guy.    the people above me are delusional. NO ONE ever turns down someone they really like or want because they are too good for them.    i'm serious dude, that girl doesn't want you.|`|oEUjPGsUaa	i understand her..  she wants someone whos on her level ..  she doesnt want to feel like she has to change things  about herself for someone it will make her uncomfortable ..  she wants someone like herself|`|aAPkpuhqaa	She doesn't think highly of herself which is an effect sometimes when growing up in an abusive family and maybe shes just scared that this wont turn out so good and she'll get hurt.|`|4RsurY2xaa	may b u need to express ur love in different way..  let her feel secured with u..  she has mindset..which u need to change..  may b her past troubles her..  don react..negativly..  try to tackle the situation with friendly      hope it helped  all the best  take care|`|l9MPAp4xaa	It sounds like she is trying to protect you from getting hurt. It sounds like she feels that if in any case the relationship doesnt work, it will end up hurting you (because you're a nice guy) more than her. It could be any reason, maybe she's too demanding, maybe she gets mean when she's aangry, etc. She just doesn't want that on her conscience.|`|7gcdOCbtaa	Perhaps she thinks of you as to good of a friend and treasures that .Once you become more then friends you can lose your best friend forever."GOOD FRIENDS ARE HARD TO FIND & YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM WHEN YOU FIND  THEM FOREVER."    Just be her friend as you have been doing.If it's meant to be it will in it's own time.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	she's lying. its an easy way of letting you down.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Aww that's a sweet of you..it's pretty tricky situation..i think there's something to do with her self-esteem/her self-confidence. She might be not ready for a relationship
9ko5WUFkaa	Because what you've experienced is a loss and you are grieving what you had, what you dreamed you have and what you have lost.  It's similar to when someone dies.  Even though your ex hasn't died your relationship has and your feelings are similar.    I ended my marriage of 13 years recently - I know it was the best thing to do.  We didn't make each other happy, didn't spend much time together and I was beginning to hate him, even though he was essentially a good man.  But being together wasn't the right thing any more for either of us.  He would have stayed but I knew that things would get worse and I didn't want us to end up like that.  I made the choice and yet it still hurts like hell.  The life I hoped we'd have together will never happen now and it's hard to move on and find a new direction in life.      Your probably going to hurt for a while, you'll go through all the "what ifs" and think about how to get him back and make it work.  But if you know it was really for the best then you will find a way to get through it.  The pain will lessen and life will be full of new and exciting experiences.|`|ni2e9UbSaa	Ever have something you cared about so much and then have it break? Same feeling. Its the feeling of emotional attachment. When you lose it, its almost as bad as leaving drugs cold turkey. It will go away as time passes. Try your best to keep your mind occupied and stray away from things that remind you of him. In time, you'll feel better.     Hope this helps.|`|UuA0Cet3aa	i know exactly what you mean my gf of 2 years recently "woke up" and decided she didn't want to be with me anymore and i'm so hurt it has been two months and i can't stop thinking about her.  i don't know what to do but take it day by day and some days are good and some are very bad but it seems like the good days are becoming more but i am the kind of person that doesn't say i love you to many and i did to her so i keep holding on to that but there is no way to tell when it will go away i hope never and then i really hope soon.  but who knows sometimes people need time apart and see what else is out there and then come back but that isn't something to hold on to either.  i know this doesn't help much but its what i know from what i'm going through right now|`|TmNYdATNaa	cause you just wasted 6 years of your life and your not getting any younger nows the time to go play the field and do the things you couldnt do before cause you were in a relationship|`|w4ZPcamlaa	Because u have been with him 4 ages and u love him so much now that u are upset and unable to get over him right now just give yourself time to get over him.  good luck|`|PmjilshSaa	because you got used to him.|`|gapWTVmDaa	It is to wake you up and learn from your mistake, reorient, be better...  If it is of any comfort, many of us were there and maybe will be there again. Loving other human always brings a pain of loosing him/her. But who want's to be alone?|`|eJBu8765aa	Because there is love envolved - and you can't turn that off, just like that. So it hurts - it always hurt's when feelings are envolved.
oGoWz511aa	I think you need to stop playing dumb.  How can you love someone you've only dated for 3 months?  What the hell do you know about him?  Let's see... He's lied to you numerous times.  He completely cuts you off when he's at home.  He's loud.  You don't trust him.  3 months, and that's what you know.      Listen up.  You don't go letting your guard down after a few months.  You NEED to get to know something about the people you date BEFORE you start falling in love.  Some people have such a strong desire to be in a relationship, they make relationships out of nothing.  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING.      Move on!  Then, take your time picking who you devote yourself to.  You have to figure out what you want and need from a relationship.  Then, when you meet a man, take the time to find out if he can give it to you.  Forget what he says.  You have to get to know someone to get to know them.  You can't be so emotionally involved that you can't let go when you need to.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	She is probably not really his ex they are probably still married so he is cheating on her not on you.    Get out of the relationship before you end up with your heart broken.    He is probably seeing other women as well.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Everyone here thinks he is cheating on you.You better wake up and tell him to get lost.He is no good and you better run fast and never look back|`|kjOsSmM0aa	I know that you love him, but he may just plain and simply be just another  woman's man. He may have you on the side line and he doesn't want his woman to know about you so he has to switch his phone off, which is wrong. If he can't answer your questions and he is constantly lying to you, then you are better off without him, because he will only hurt you. Especially if you are not married to him.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It sounds like it. I would find a new man.|`|KncPJwIaaa	my man is cheating and you know it so your sixth sense you females have so well is 99.9% right most of the time get out while the getting is good|`|1kfeghDDaa	3 MONTHS and he is already lying to you....and you need this person is your life because????????    Life is short, you are young why settle??|`|BbRewQjQaa	Yes he is cheating on you you may want to call cheaters they will hook you up.|`|EAt1rB8naa	sounds like he is cheating on u,, u should follow ur gut if u think he's lying he probably is and the answers he is giving u are trash|`|y38SHaeaaa	move on..this man is surely cheating on you.  You deserve the best!|`|wF2G3Krcaa	8 times out of 10 when a woman suspects her man is cheating, he is. Drop him and get a man you deserve. You shouldn't have to be in this situation. Even if he isn't cheating, he's lying and to me, that's just as bad.|`|qX4J6SmIaa	It's only been three months??  Did you both decide if you're in a committed relationship??  If not then he's not doing anything wrong besides being sneaky.  Sounds like the ex is the cake and you're the ice cream.  Leave now before the sneakiness drives you cRaZy!!|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	He is.... one way that I figured it out is....that you have to ask...if you ever have to ask...go with your gut feeling....|`|2NUJsWIoaa	HE IS MARRIED AND CHEATING ON HIS WIFE WITH YOU!!! My husband did the same thing!!|`|D0VC1FXqaa	when will you figure out he's playing you. you know you're not telling the whole story. but maybe you are! who knows... i don't think you are. he seems shady so leave. if you're already questioning, it's a bad sign. so even if he's not cheating on you, do you really want to deal with that sort of personality???
zt0wLQzVaa	omg ditch the jerk immediately. what a terrible lowlife loser.|`|6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Remember when you are constantly verbally abused by your partner, you are the sufferer as it eventually leads to low self esteem, hampering of confidence and eventual mental torture. Abuse of any kind needs to be carefully and practically dealt with. Tell your family members and friends about it. You should not be a silent sufferer as abusive relationships can completely hamper the emotional and psychological self of a person, eventually leading to depression.   Do not compromise your self respect and happiness to keep an abusive relationship alive.   Move to a safer place, to your friends or relatives place. Discuss your problems and seek professional advise if need arises, there are several social institutions and government firms which works for this very purpose. Whatever be the case as a victim of abuse do not shy away from moving out of such relationships. After all, as an individual, you have all the right to live your life in a safe, healthy and respectful way. If need be u may lodge a formal complaint to the police,   GoodLuck>r|`|rH4eUC9Baa	lawl, you pawn. >.> GF|`|taQFWXuHaa	yea thts called a stalker...... be very careful and try to avoid him as much as possible and i suggest you tell your parents bc im sure tht when ever everybody else turns their back on you they will alwasy be there to help you out!!!|`|tXlvg1ahaa	I know the type well.  Please, please stay far away from this chap.  He will eventually poison you so badly in a spiritual way that you will never recover.  Resort to getting an interdict against him if you must.

This is coming from someone who has been in an abusive relationship and one who has seen an abusive relationship end tragically.     You are the most important person in your life you belong to no one but yourself. You do not need someone as low as this. Eff him he is no good.|`|xglNqFn3aa	forgive and forget him|`|kpykP4NDaa	He is sick stay away for him
c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	Sounds like he needs to grow up and you have a decision to make if you feel he does this too often then it won't stop so then kick him to the curb. Talk with him first and tell him how unfair this is and that if he wants a relationship with you this kind of crap has to stop NOW or you will find someone else who will treat you the right way|`|74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	This doesn't sound like much of a future...at least not a happy one. Life is too short to spend it with the wrong person. He needs to give you one heck of an explanation when he gets home and really be ready to show you he will not make you worry again like this.|`|KUZrSrrBaa	Leave him, he's most likely cheating on you. & thats how STD's are spread.|`|qW4GVjROaa	Loose him, sounds like he has a more important agenda than you|`|6qPndPvXaa	um do you see your question here one year from now?  2 years from now?  5 years from now?

He gets drunk and doesn't come home?  Well, I am sorry, but he is sleeping somewhere... and if it's not with you... it is probably with another girl.    Tell him to grow up, or move on.    And in the meantime, you should probably get tested for STD's if he is sleeping around when drunk, he probably doesn't have the best judgement ot use a condom.|`|c7yAbvycaa	Oh that sucks, and yea you should be really angry.  if i was you i would'nt know what to do,i'd probably kill my bf if he did that shiit to me.|`|CWDTEV82aa	OMG give the guy some space let him have a little fun also the best way to lose someone is to checkup on them with there mom and keepin tabs this seems to be just the way he is and i your otconfotable there are plenty of othr people out there who like to stay at home all the time.    and no dont be angry, relax not worth getting all upset over.    been there done that been in your shoes trust me ttly not worth the stress.|`|ZsEBqBYvaa	well, sometimes u have to let someone fill how important u are to him by simply cooling off. sometimes a man feels how important a partner when his partner calls it off, or when his partner is not around anymore. so if u still love urself, try to think about it.|`|AxhYMmD3aa	youre so damn clingy i would dump your asssss|`|a759042489672e78a2c3702afb3f5daaaa	You need to tell him what you want out of the relationship, if he has a problem with it that is when you need to let him go.|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	Doesn't sound like the marriage type.....|`|JsffWlnEaa	thta sounds suspicious.he might use it as an excuse to cheat on you(i was to drunk to know what i was doing).doesnt sound reliable...you can and deserve better|`|XVVkrlnTaa	No use in dating him if you can't rely on him. You need to be able to rely on your partner in life. And Yeah, I would have been angry!!!|`|0ba4c9ff30dbd5fcca6962160c91d3c2aa	I think you answered your own question.  If you feel you can't rely on him or trust him, how the hell can you ever have any kind of a relationship with the guy?  I would definitely be angry, since this shows how little respect he has for you.
J0RJ3MS7aa	if at night and chilly, you say, "you look cold" and you take off your jacket. and your wrap it around her, with both hands still holding on to the collar of your jacket. then slowly but surely look into her eyes, inch closer to her, look at her lips, inch closer, look at her eyes, inch closer. if she tilts her head forward, well then you get even closer with your eyes closed. but DON'T kiss her. let HER KISS YOUUUUUUUUU. just like the movie Hitch|`|2LsPtnebaa	Dear, there's nothing left to say. Just kiss her! :)|`|uIUXpteMaa	dont say...  just kiss her   and ofcourse !!!  you are not supposed to say her hey can i kiss u i want to !!!  just kiss her .........|`|1zwxspIAaa	Say: Open wide, the love muscle is coming in.|`|6boH5X5Baa	hold her face in your hands and lean forward really slowly if she  doesn't want to kiss you just back off
ise05jjUaa	Most likely its because as women, women are taught that its okay to show your emotions, to cry, to laugh, to admit your in love or any other number of feelings.  Whereas men, we've been taught to suppress those feelings, that to show any emotion is a sign of weakness.  The only emotion that doesn't seem this way to me is anger & a lot of men will show that side of them.  After years of being taught to be strong, boys don't cry & so on once you reach adulthood you're feelings have pretty much been pushed to the side.  They're still there, they're just not in the right place & when it comes to dealing with them as we get older & we start feelings these weird, irrational feelings as to why we feel this way about a certain lady we don't understand them.  So they're confusing, so yes its hard at times to know whether or not you love someone or not because you've never really expressed that as a man growing up & what love really is.  On the other hand he may not want to hurt you.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	a man can't make up his mind whether he does not love u  It is circumstances, the other woman that decides that he loves her  It is not that he hates u, or does not love u, The whole thing is that he loves the other woman, and has no place for u (but he may still love u).|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Because he enjoys stringing you along.|`|nsVbWXKraa	he doesn't want to hurt u|`|5vcd7GHNaa	Cause, he's dense. D;|`|sYxtPBziaa	Yeah because we all know women have REALLY sharp senses...  We try to make it easy for you by saying we love you SARCASTICLY.|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	He's confused and he might be the type that sticks with you and tries to make it work.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Because he doesn't love you...

This will work perfectly if you're at a Comic-Con type convention or something!|`|CqJnT2Oqaa	Umm... it really depends on your age... I'd say 10 or younger would be great lol.  It also depends on the girl and what she likes... I'd really NOT recommend it though...

JR1MKBKtaa	Go with the first guy cause at least you know he likes you, and after you date him for awhile if the second guy gets jealous, well then you can reevaluate your choice.
qrx6PhFDaa	beleive it or not, a random place usually works out better|`|Gp1h69mnaa	Dating sites are good for keeping meeting new friends while a random place may create good friends.|`|dnoJPmG7aa	I have mixed feeling about it. My first reaction is negative but I do have friends that have had positive results.     When my friends tell me negative experiences I just remind them "remember the source of this guy" be careful. People can say what they want due to the fact they are selling themselves online. They are trying to make themselves attractive in every way possible. It's like going to a bar online.     But who am I to judge. How would you describe the perfect way to meet someone special. Just like any encounter you have to ask the appropriate questions to see if this one is right for you just like you would at a coffee shop or meeting someone at a party. It's all in the comfort level you have.     I have a friend that is very comfortable with it. She is older, feels silly & uncomfortable going to bars at her age. But before I judge her I ask myself how do I want her to meet someone, then I realize she is out there just like all the rest just trying to find someone special. She has just found a method that she is comfortable with.     It is truly up to the individual & their comfort level. I'm trying to be open minded even though I have not taken this route yet. Be opened minded.|`|VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on http://wwwsinglesnet.info  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|wUkU3HVwaa	match.com    ;D;D|`|MGixzYVHaa	I thinks sites are safer. You could be in potential trouble meeting someone in a random place. Just dont give out dangerous information about you online (adress...number...)|`|coQ3EPTbaa	no! u never no who it is! meet em at a bar or something!!|`|sPSoDKf0aa	Some of them are good, try http://thebest-datingsites.com for help finding the best ones, they review and compare them|`|U6RtrD5taa	probably better to meet people in the world, but eHarmony is the best one out there for dating websites.|`|ofhtTv55aa	Depends.  I met a couple who were connected through one site and dated for over a year, and another who got married after a few years. Hasn't worked for anyone in my family though..seems being introduced by a friend is better.|`|gv7unj2Waa	no they suck, all they do is take your money and you still end up being alone with less cash. better to go into the world and meet someone there than online|`|YEZVTDJmaa	My parents met through a newspaper add and they're still together and happy.
o5dxDl02aa	Yeah you are trippin with that one. How can you expect anyone to respect you if you're with 15 men at once.|`|9J6NhFXJaa	a threesome is one thing but FIFTEEN guys!!  thats something your best off keeping to urself|`|r0HYuHubaa	hellz yeah..i thought u were a **** after the first line..no offense..

3lKAR9G2aa	It depends on your definition of a man.  I go to work every day, come straight home every day, play with the kids sometimes, help around the house sometimes and tell my wife that I love her at least 3 times every day.  I happen to think that men like me are a dying breed.  Oh...I tend to stroke my own ego sometimes too.   lol|`|07YBD5mJaa	i have heard that woman out number men now days. pretty sad. my advice, find a good man and hold onto him!|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Man drought? No, there is a "type of man women generally look for while snubbing the others" drought.    Edit: Great answer, The Man.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	i was going to ask the same thing about women.|`|6t76bgS3aa	well, the problem is that us cool guys are getting fewer and fewer|`|M8x2btaIaa	yes. the good ones are going extinct|`|aXOyK3uBaa	No. There is not a man drought.    But there is a men's MOVEMENT going on right now and men are going on strike. Feminism is a HUGE problem in this country and men have had enough.    I know you probably think Feminism is dead and gone in the 60s but its such a part of mainstream American Culture that it is considered a "mental illness" which affects 2 out of 3 American women.    Read the paperback - "The Cultural Devastation of American Women: The Strange and Frightening Decline of the American Female" - by Nancy Levant.    Men are very quickly finding out that women consistently FAIL a cost/benefit analysis in marriages and relationships.    It's all in the book.    That's what happens when you "DEMAND respect".....  instead of thinking it's your place to EARN it.    We are preferring to remain single.  And it's awesome.|`|3t0492VOaa	idk but it sure feels like it|`|NFKJ9J0Saa	false;|`|Gk8Ya4WGaa	explain what exactly a "man drought" is|`|ovMjLwL6aa	There isn't, I'm here.|`|61ec56086e8cfa9334ab5b573f98f887aa	yes and im the last of the free ones hit me up if u want to reserve me|`|isxNUJlZaa	Correction: there's a gentleman drought.    There are still plenty of moronic men out there who label themselves as gentlemen when they aren't, unfortunately.     Don't give up, though; you'll find a good one worth holding onto! :)
hChy7BAPaa	umm yeah.. this happens all the time. but most of the time someone feels like they'd screw up the friendship if they were to like their good friend...but hey..you guys could actually fall in love...if you havent already.|`|pXP2QF8raa	If you are a girl and have a close guy friend, chances are one of you is gonna fall for the other.|`|9xXH9p9taa	Yeah you can|`|Akmdvhv6aa	yes.... it's common.
rOtfBBEYaa	If you really think that she might be the right person for you, then you should go for it. Try to not have any regrets.|`|258mrT2Paa	contact her online, if she does not come into eat anymore, draw your own conclusions, she does not like you , or you food is crap.|`|zh6JI88Haa	Yes if you're in love with her|`|EHCM324Faa	It kind of sound depress and more like a stalker to me... Why won't you just call her up instead?|`|kQufRZDjaa	i say go for it! life is short  unless you want to take your chances and wait another 3 weeks|`|hMwM5zeXaa	Yes I think you should talk to her. You could tell her you were just searching random profiles and thought she looked familiar and thought you would say hi and see how she's doing!
n2E3NDraaa	All relationships need spark and work, not a ton of work but some effort on both sides. I have been with my guy for 5yrs. We argue about simple things, we get on each others nerves, we make up and we take time away from each other.  We have broken up but we always end up right back together in a week, we are each others firsts as well. I say give it time. Its been a year, its time to settle down with the being really attached. Hang out with friends separately, do things alone, send her flowers...you both are in love. Relax, this thing happens a lot! If it still isn't what you want for you or her in a month, then break it off. Love is like a roller-coaster; Anything worth loving is worth fighting for!!|`|tK7XacH7aa	You two need to reignite the spark between you two. This is just a common phase in relationships and those relationships that can get through this are those who will be able to weather the storm of relationship problems. Instead of fighting about the smallest things, one of you have to give in, since you know this you have to, to keep the relationship alive.  NO BOYFRIEND IS PERFECT, we all make mistakes and if we can learn from them and get better then the relationship gets better. Don't break up, keep trying. Only if you see that you aren't compatible should you quit. You've been going out for a year a three months and now you want to kill it because you lost the bond!?! That's going to happen to all your relationships. Just be the best person that you can be. You are in love, you just need to reignite the spark. All couples do something to try and keep the spark and the love life alive, and that's what the both of you should do.   Don't break up. You may regret it down the line. Especially if you can never find another person like her. I'm sure she means a lot to you and do you really want to end that relationship just because you lost the spark?|`|2fZKpW9yaa	i went through this 3 weeks ago with my gf of 2 years... here is what you say... it is going to suck but you have to say it...  "I don't love you with the same passion that you love me. I'm sorry. You just don't complete me anymore. You need to go find a guy who completes you and cares about you as much as you do him. and that guy is just not me. I do still love you but that does not mean i am in love with you."  You know exactly what you need to say. you said it in your question. you just have to dig deep down in you to get the courage to say it to her... it took me 3 months to let mine go... i suggest you do NOT wait that long. it will just get harder...|`|DmI09kcFaa	it sounds like although you guys are really in love with eachother, you aren't in love in the relationship that you too have.  as hard as it will be, you should end it.  it will be better in the long run for both you and her even though it will be really hard at first.    sorry.    good luck.|`|vzDgu1xkaa	Well try to go out with her to the movies or whatever more. maybe find common intrests so you can bond|`|jGgRF3Yjaa	so sorry for what u feel.. i think it is better for both of you to break up in a good way.. make her understand how u feel.. :)|`|qL3dGTXDaa	You are being a sap. That "I know she deserves better", "all I wanted was the experience" does not fly with me. Look, spare her your whiny story and end it.|`|Fb11LZdOaa	Ok have another week it sucks brake up with her with flowers|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Whatever You Wana Do I Would'nt No|`|aBL04eRbaa	First, talk to her about it and see if you can repair the damage,   See if you can make it like it was,   if you can't, then you'll have to speak to her about what's on your mind,   and see what she thinks you should do.   For all you know she cvould be feeling the same way.   This is a tender issue,   She may want space and she might go nuts,  But just stay calm and let her steam off how ever she does.  Good luck.|`|ar2So81eaa	Unfortunately, there is no sure fire way to ensure an amicable breakup, but I do think it's time to break up. Don't drag it out. Just be honest, but not mean. Tell her you just aren't feeling it anymore and that you think its best to move on. She might freak or she might say she feels the same way...one thing is sure, honesty is the best policy.|`|ghItgMZxaa	well its kinda a simple decision. if you don't want to be with her any more than its time to move on. heres a famous saying there are plenty of fish in the sea!!!!|`|jVFsl9FBaa	I think you should just open up and tell her the truth, but not so harshly.    Just say something like:    I love you so much, but just not the same way anymore.  I have lost the 'special bond', I use to feel, and I don't want to risk our friendship by continuing in something that I don't really feel anymore.  I'm sorry, but I don't think we should see eachother anymore, you deserve so much better, and I think the perfect guy is out there somewhere, and I don't want you to be held back from finding him by me.    Hope I helped :)    Good luck!|`|wscyjkPAaa	I just think the honeymoon period is over.  This is normal in most relationships and I think to be real, you just got tired of her.  If you really "love her" I don't think you'd be in this position.  I think the romantic feelings are gone and your friendship bond is still there.  It seems like you're really young and its your choice whether to leave her or not.  If she loves you the way you say she does then she won't go away, at worst she'll be a great friend.  If you feel like you want to see other people, then go ahead, again your choice.  You're young and you'll see plenty of other girls in the future.  Just be sure to think it over first because you may never get her back.|`|DjsQlvTRaa	So, you are going to break her heart no matter what you do, unless you can force yourself to love her the way you need to. So, you need to be kind to her feelings and tell her the truth. She may not understand and may ask alot of questions, but just stick to your guns. And because this is your first love, when you see her heart breaking you are going to feel the urge to mend things, but this is not the right thing to do. Just let the relationship go. And when she calls you (alot) after the fact, again be kind to her feelings and just tell her to try and move on for her own benefit. Be super nice, but don't lead her on to think a relationship is possible.|`|ql0RmOLiaa	sorry but this happened to me and my boyfriend...and now weve been dating for three and a half years...split for a wile...how old are you? if your young....go have fun...plz cuz i didnt and now i live with hiim...i love him but i want to be single agin sooooo bad just fora wile...cuz i started dating him when i was 14...now im 18AND IVE NEVER BEEN WITH ANOTHER GUY!!!! plz for me do it!!!|`|GL6WkpONaa	if u dont feel like its workn out then just "go ur separate ways!" :)|`|c32MJwDJaa	I think you should seperate for maybe a week and see if you miss her  if you do then get back together but if you dont than maybe it just wasnt meant to be.|`|hR0acjx3aa	What ever you do don't procrastinate, I think you should just be completely honest and break it to her gently. Good luck.  Hope it works out O.K.|`|FMYxRFQuaa	tell her this. exactly what you wrote. especially the part where you want her to be happy and she deserves it. be easy on her when you break it to her, please.|`|tzzYdnZKaa	She is your first girlfriend. You think you really love her but you havn't tried other girls. You should break i off because there is no sense in going after what you used to feel for her. There will be plenty of other girls you will love!|`|Ko8mz6lmaa	well mabye stay with her longer and kiss her a lot. but if ur a kid spend lots of time with her and give her lots of hugs. but if ur a teenager kiss her makeout with her be close to her.it'll feel really good and you might get your love for her back. if all this is not working then one night go to her house or just take a walk with her and talk to her about how you are starting to feel. but dont be to hard with her. and if she starts to argue with her act mature take wut she says and ask for turns to talk and say you know like weve been together for a while and were going to have other people in our lives. if you have any other questions just message me.|`|fvFpKFpZaa	if you want her to be happy tell her every thing that is in your heart  tell her the same thing you told us in yahoo answers do it .  I did that when I used to have a boyfriend,I saw him sad not happy with me but we used to be in love but when I told him everything in my heart we bougth was happy so do it and say everything you feel.|`|35na31DLaa	I feel like the first step would be to talk to her. Let her know how you're feeling; you might be able to save the relationship if you're open with her.      If that doesn't work it might be time to move on. If the spark isn't there anymore, it's going to be harder to force feelings that aren't real. Just be honest with her.

O6lT2u2waa	It's not so much a booty call as it is a rebound. That's nothing against you, I recently went through a tough breakup and my best friend who is a girl, we became really close, almost awkwardly close. It just felt nice to have someone I could be very open with, kind of the way you're describing as well, though with my friend it was maybe a little more mutual. If you don't like it, I would suggest to just kind of keep your distance a little bit more, like when you're around each other, don't get within touching distance so much. He should get the hint.|`|0cCZkuBOaa	Say: Knock it off    If he keeps harassing you give him a good diss =P (at your own risk)    Suggestions:  "Stop touching me! No wonder your ex broke up with you!"  "Stop touching me! No wonder you can't get a girlfriend!"  "It's funny 'cause you ACTUALLY think that I like you, but c'mon who would like you!?"    Good luck ^^|`|8wi2X5sSaa	maybe he just needs a friend to lean on and thats u. dont be mean because u cant blame him for needing someone after a breakup.|`|RNUCiRhqaa	How would that hurt him sounds like he is doing just fine.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	You ARE the backup. Don't worry about hurting him-just tell him to knock it off. He doesn't care about your feelings.
U8oR3VU6aa	Don't stoop to her level. And don't waste your time trying to undo the crap she does. It will be difficult, but ignore all you can of this. When people approach you with 'messages' from her, just walk away or put your hand up and say, 'I get it' and walk away. People will have more respect for you when you don't wallow with the pigs. The more you try to defend yourself the deeper you will get into her game. The friends who believe her are not worth your time. The ones who stick by you are your real friends. You will get through this, and how you handle it will determine how you deal with people in the future.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	write something really bad on her car or slash her tires|`|5pohRQ2Zaa	If you're the better person no one will care, they'll like you better anyways.|`|UAIbJGPuaa	Hmm Well Talk to you're friends about her.DO NOT Be in mature to her or w.e (you probably arnt)But be nothing but nice to her that's how i got my friends back when i was in this situation.And sorry im not that much of help... Answer Mine (on Profile)|`|foJndaKgaa	First, stop referring to this person as a "female dog" and don't let others hear you say bad things about her.  This will cause them to decide to take sides and taking sides will break up friendships and make everyone unhappy.  In this world there will always be people that will misunderstand you, intentionally say bad things, and try to hurt you but learn to be the mature and better person by forgiving and just letting it go.  When others see that you are not being MEAN in return, they will tend to want to be around you and will believe you much more than her.  Try going to her and telling her that you want her to forgive you if you said or did something to hurt her - she may accept that or she may reject it, that's OK you have done your part to make peace and remember what JESUS said - Blessed are the peacemakers!

hh892gJfaa	If there isn't a boy you like, then what makes you want a boyfriend?    Having a boyfriend just for the sake of having a boyfriend, not because you really like the guy, is not going to work. Just going around looking for a boyfriend isn't going to help you find your prince charming or whatever. It's going to help you find someone who likes you way more than you like them, or someone who is just taking advantage of you.    Single is good.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I'm the first one to say boys are great. But if you NEED  a boy to feel good about things, then you have some serious problems.    You need to feel good about yourself, and feel happy WITHOUT a guy, before you will be happy with one.    Your father probably sees you aren't happy with yourself, and knows you are likely to do stupid things to find and keep a guy, because you are so desperate to have one. He's trying to protect you from doing things you will regret forever.    If you go behind his back, he will lose trust in you even more, and it will be even more difficult for you to get out and meet people, and enjoy your life.|`|w4ZPcamlaa	How old are u? there is no need to rush into having a boyfriend. Oh and if u are 12 or 13 u should wait until u are older.  Most guys are jerks these days anyway.|`|DKDzqEbMaa	Don't worry so much as finding a boyfriend yet  You sound like you don't have a guy that you're thinking about asking out yet.    Don't stress about things until you have to.    If you end up finding a guy just go to the movies with him as "friends"  Maybe ease your dad into it by going with friends on a double date and being the last ones to go home so you actually have time with each other.    Find loopholes in the rules :)|`|OE8r1VtRaa	You cant just WANT a BF, you need to wait til you fall for someone. whats the point injust having one for the sake of having one?  Do you really just want to be with ome bumbling spotty idiot who just wants a grope and a quick shag?   Its best to wait til yo find someone who likes you and enjoys your company, it leads to a much more enjoyable relationship especially if you have things in common.   Dont be silly, your dad has every right to be protective as he can probably see the silliness behind it. Just wait until you meet someone, you'll know if he is worth your time.  Save yourself and your virginity until you meet someone worthy, you'll only regret it otherwise..    =) all the best x|`|FXD0rHyzaa	well i have the same problem as you except my mum doesnt mind me having a boy friend   the best thing to do is not to go looking for a boyfriend and just let him find you then that way it can be special   you dont just go out with a boy and then see if you like them   when you find the right guy it will make a great impact in your life and you will then know he is the right guy for you trust me i like this guy but im not gonna ask him out until i find out he likes me back XD    so the best thing to do is just to wait then that way you will save your dad a heart attack       =] i hope i helped|`|A5nkaq7Yaa	well it all depends on your age...  Dont go out there and look for a BF just because you "want one"...  you will just end up getting hurt, look for a nice guy. someone that you actually like, not only by the way he look...or how "cool" he is, but by the way you guys feel around ea other...as for the dad thing...if he is being protective it might be for a reason...|`|3YpB2Ttpaa	you see sis life not the same , im sure there will be some one that would like according to my point of view i will give u a hint-       1.Be posh     2.Act as your a actress     3.Act as you are very demanded on boys    trust me the third one really works coz i have some expereience !!    welll i wish u good luck in finding a boy friend !

I know. :x|`|173vsiacaa	of course not! wow, this whole imma-man-i-can't-cry thing is sort of driving me up the wall...   we are HUMAN with EMOTIONS and crying does NOT at all lead one into being a 'sissy'    i think it's great that your boyfriend care so much for your father. that is incredibly sweet and commendable, especially in this age whereby - like you said - many young people have decided to not 'give a rat's @*** about their parents'. it shows that he has heart and is loving. surely you wouldn't want to let go off a rare gem like him, do you?    i really think you should embrace your boyfriend.|`|PBX0h0zyaa	I think it is really attractive when a guy cries.. If of coarse its not for a sissy reason. like... ha ha i cant think of any.. but im sure you know what i mean..    I think this shows that he loves his dad and is touched and sad appreciates that he works so hard,.. ive cried for my dad many times.. It shows he has a good heart.     He is by no means a sissy..   I think your lucky to have him..    love peace and chicken grease  [=|`|acWyJ3t0aa	I think you are right on about your boyfriend and that your gf should keep her nose out of you two's business unless asked . Stay with your own thoughts because you are 100% right about it.
KOYZfaDkaa	I think you gotta let it go (not easy, I know), but you gotta just drop it and focus on the people who will attend. Maybe take this as a hint that things have changed and maybe your friendship with them in over. You said you're a "wild child", well maybe they're more conservative now and don't appreciate how fun you are.     It doesn't sound like your wedding needs these downers there anyways- no loss at all :) Congratulations!!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	they've shown you their true colors, as I'm sure they've been doing for 20 years.  forget them, you're socially incompatible with them if that's the way they act.  I mean it's sort of gauche of you to ask what they have better to do the day of your wedding, it means you're passing judgement on their plans to decide if they're worth missing your wedding or not.  but if they're the kind of people that are chronically unavailable, and I know the type believe me, quit them because obviously they won't be there for you when you need or want them around.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If their response is out of context for how you normally know them to be, then judge them based on the 1,000 other experiences that you have with them and not just this one.  You could have caught someone at a very bad moment.  If you caught someone in the "right" mood, they could have perceived your e-mail as forcing them to justify why they couldn't attend your wedding.  Not great...but friendships should be able to withstand periodic misunderstandings and bad moods.    If this is how they normally are, well...that's par for the course then.    If this is a good friendship that has endured the test of time, then eat a little crow, apologize for your unintended rudneness.  Explain that you were just being curious to see if they had a fabulous trip planned (since they take such great trips all the time) and that you didn't really want them to justify their decline.  Acknowledge how poorly you must have come across to them but assure them that it wasn't your intention.  Tell them that you will miss their company but that you hope to catch up together with them at another time.|`|1kSRPadaaa	what bitches! don't bother yourself thinking about them again! go off and enjoy your day|`|MGOFjVnVaa	a wide variety of reasons for the behaviour of your friends  is possible. one thing is for sure, they really are not good friends.    the best idea for you would be to get married without family or  friend, maybe during a holiday and forget your original plans.    just on the side - i got remarried 4 years ago, i married a foreigner  and was not so sure how my family and friends would react.  so we married in his country, including his family in the wedding  and i sent marriage notes to "my" people afterwards. i never  regretted doing that.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	I see this happen a LOT. Even happened at my wedding. What it boils down to is.... you have NOT been in touch.. no fault of your own but theirs. They are not JUST NOW blowing you off, they have been for a long time now  "SO busy"    Invite someone else. It is that simple. Dont waste your time or your tears over them, they are SO NOT worth it.|`|a984cQjKaa	plain and simple, they suck.  you'll probably have much more fun without them.|`|mTKD9GQvaa	you never know what goes on behind closed doors, they could have something really personal going on, like an operation or something. People change in 20 years, i think i would just try and forget about it, but maybe after that date, send an email sayin you would like to meet up, maybe just to look at your wedding photgrahs and when you spend some time with them you might find out why they couldnt make it. If i was important then youl understand. if they were just blowing you off, then your done with them, and leave without paying your share lol!|`|kXoV5JnWaa	you did the right thing by inviting them and  found out what they are really like[not really friends] my answer is delete them from your life they are tossers have a great day. ps you have been taught a lesson on real friendship|`|PkDokr8Iaa	It is your wedding, and you and your fiance choose the wedding date.    If invited guests are unable to attend due to prior commitments, then it is what it is.    Enjoy your day.|`|fb7721ad747d2c6d87fb2b8481cf7ff7aa	You think if its was  something really important and they genuinely wanted to come they would of said im sorry have an urgent appointment eg  doctor's etc that i have to attend otherwise I would really of love to come and are so sorry I can' otherwise why try and hide the fact of what they are really doing (because i assume you would of given them enough notice to attend) . They could feel uncomfortable because its been such longtime since they have seen you and  feel you haven't got things in common anymore. seems  like they don't deserve you and they should hold on to the ones who are genuinely  happy for you. Have a really beautiful and peaceful wedding.|`|Ub1KbPvDaa	Screw them... Those can't be REAL friends.  Nothing is more important than YOUR wedding day unless they are getting married the same day!  And yes, tell those bitches "it is about you"... It's your wedding day.  Unbelievable!|`|crxbob5jaa	Hey, what's the big deal? You have found the love of your life, why do these idiots matter. They don't want to be there.......it wasn't a summons......it was an invitation.....and they chose to decline.     No issue. Have an awesome time and think nothing else of it.
cMfiJueXaa	Well first of all you shouldn't worry about what your friends say about you or what you do. The thing is that you like that song and you shouldn't care what someone says about what you put on your myspace page. That page is reflecting your personality and your good friend is just trying to get on your nerves. If it bothers you that much that your friend said something b*tchy about your song then just take it off and your problems will only get worse because your friend will think she can control you and start bossing you around and control what happens on you myspace page. So go on with your day and don't say anything back and do what you want.    Hope this helps. sorry your friend is being that way. good luck.|`|AA10919477	just ignore her!when she is not getting any reaction from you,she will feel foolish and humiliated.|`|F69WYrtBaa	I used this song first, and you can't speak for Tasha, therefore you're a tryhard one of her.
pKzH1cFHaa	If he is not willing to work on problems or listen to you, I would leave. Do you really want to put up with that until death do you part?
8dd6860c003f14d0b36d1ccb66ce5531aa	It's perfectly acceptable.   Girls love that sort of thing.   I was on the bus around christmas and when I got off, a complete stranger tapped me on the shoulder and showed me something he had written on the screen of his iphone, it said, "I just wanted to say, I think you're really cute :-) merry christmas! xx" and then he just walked off.   It made my day.     Hopefully your compliment will make her day too.   Just make sure you're not too slimy or sleazy about it.   A simple, "you look really pretty today" will suffice.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Giving compliments is fine providing there is no ulterior motive - such as saying "you are very pretty" but thinking "now get into my bed...." you have to learn to deal with compliments and wheedle out the sincere ones from the others.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's fine.|`|cvRscoQ3aa	She might think that it's a little weird. You should get to know her a little bit first.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	sure why not|`|sYxtPBziaa	Well, if it's in an event or something and she just did 9024 consecutive back flips without stopping, then yeah, compliment her.|`|MYqu4bDNaa	seems premature,but o.k.|`|ThmKnRVOaa	it's fine|`|XS3PexPIaa	Don't you like being complimented?|`|PSzZen5Maa	If you find it offensive then its not ok. But usually complements are appreciated, so its ok. Just know that, that guy is into you.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	he was trying to be nice. what's wrong with that.|`|uNVOPkruaa	sure, girls always like hearing a nice compliment :)|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	Of corse it is.. Are you mad not to accept that this guy likes you and complimented you? I understand if you felt weird about it because you dont like him or you have never seen him, but accept the compliment and let it give you a boost. Maybe he gave you a compliment because he likes you and that was he way of "first contact" :) xx|`|hHndD5SEaa	Id find nothing whatsoever wrong with that!  xx|`|PuopJHPcaa	sigh actually he shouldnt complement her|`|Xad2J8bgaa	It depends on your charisma.  It would work if you have the charm to attract a girl. Even the ugliest guy in the world can win the heart of the most beautiful woman if he has this charm.    Don't give too much positive words on the girl, you'd look like a freak.
gv7unj2Waa	i would get suspicious, but you cant just assume something, you gotta have evidence...solid proof..something...cuz when u assume u make an *** out of U and ME|`|BI8c6XXPaa	No, she probably saw them somewhere and was curious and figured you were a guy so she would ask.|`|3e430dfa158f7d5fe1898862e3d1db83aa	she is just curious and maybe wanting to try it herself.ask her about it.|`|GG45LsNeaa	You and your chick get it on without Condoms. Eh?  Nice Bean.|`|muHctmaGaa	She might just be curious, otherwise she never would have asked you.|`|vYAfNGmfaa	Maybe she wants to start using them.|`|ni2e9UbSaa	I didn't know Mr. Bean rolled that way. Nice going Mr. Bean!
xkgcYeXPaa	I see you have yellow fever|`|aexekiU9aa	honestly,,u look good..  i think rate it 8 from 10..    well, i'm an asian..  an indonesian..  but i'm 16!! lol...|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	i'm scared........ i'm going to have nightmares for the rest of my life =(|`|EgUxu5kjaa	hey! ure real good looking!  8/10! :)|`|AA11284982	yo man move to the bay area lol northern california... white ppl here sure are minority you'll find asian ladies everywhere lol.|`|6boH5X5Baa	okay hey i'm chinese i don't think you look ugly or anything to tell u the truth your kinda hot, but to give you some advice hmm i don't know where you live and all but don't move you don't need to just go somewhere where asian girls go but just to tell you, asian girls, their parents want, okay i'm not being racist or anything but their parents like mine want me to find another asian guy so we can have little asian babies its really annoying i would love to date you and all i'm 19 but i already have a boyfriend but goodluck|`|G9QKZFvvaa	Not bad, I would give you a chance.|`|W9OOH2lEaa	i think you lack confidence in yourself.Actually,your appearance is not bad.
AgzRyqWTaa	you must however full your stomach first,let him buy you lunch,dinner something so you might not feel cheap in the end.Tell him use more decent words than feel me up such as caress or explore sounds more intimate[laugh,laugh] anyway go for it, if you are ready you  are grown tell him you will play a copy game anything he touches on your body you touch him on his, breast,chest,lips,neck,hair,nose then get lower navel and you know....|`|mITpAYReaa	Make out with him if you want, or do what you feel you should at the time. I'm sure when the time is right you will know.|`|wJstSw9Daa	That all depends on you if you want to kiss him while he feels you up. If I was the guy doing that I couldn't just feel her up and not kiss her.|`|DzXDJCfZaa	If you do let him, you should kiss him or something  And he wont care that your a B cup, or he wouldnt have asked in the first place    good luck|`|Iq0ZW0vVaa	well if you are old enough, you've probably seen enough romantic movies that show how it works.......|`|uz0R5pjHaa	well um... wear a really padded bra and god luck with that :D|`|K2Et4Hyaaa	wow lol just makeout { touch}  but dont have sex your gonna regret it! don"t stand there you makeout with him while he feels you up !|`|NgpHScXnaa	i was 16 when i got my first kiss.      umm.. yeah its normal for u to be curious and want him to do that lol.    just go with the flow ..but make sure u don't get pregnant.     B cup is fine some guys prefer u to not have huge boobs.     don't awkwardly stand there ...just kiss him while hes doing it and act like ur enjoying it.  but just so u know hes gonna want u to do it back to him then move onto actual sex.  haha.|`|DjsQlvTRaa	If you can try and take yourself out of your body. So don't think about anything...ANYTHING. Turn off your brain. Just go with what feels good. Get into it. AND DO NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT HE MAY THINK. so if you want to close your eyes, close them...if you want to make noise, make noise...do what you want.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	If your a B cup you've probably got at least a handful, which is enough for a guy to play with. usually you would be making out with the guy when he's feeling you up. I doubt you will regret it if he grabs your chest or butt, its really not a big deal. If you start to feel uncomfortable, just kind of pull back & tell him thats enough for now.  |`|GQ8aKXr6aa	Although I've never had a relationship either, I'd say at least don't stand there like a statue.. make it more intimate..    Make out with him at least..don't let him get to you unless he works a little bit for it..    It's not like he's trying out a new car, seeing how everything moves, and what breaks if he pulls or twists it too far.|`|P38ULZbraa	Honestly, I don't think you should be hooking up. You should only let a guy touch you if you are completely comfortable with them and love them. If you do choose to hook up with this boy, you should make out with him while he feels you up, but I strongly suggest you wait for someone you love.|`|AA11542500	It would be awkward if you just stood there.  When you're making out, that's when you should be groping each other.  It kinda comes naturally so just go with it.  If you have to think about what you're doing it could totally ruin the moment.  Don't worry about if you're doing it right or not, just go with your emotions.  The only thing you should worry about is how far you are willing to go and you should pretty much already know this before you start making out.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	well if you hook up with to many guys you will be known as a hooker,but as a teen ager i selt manny developing breast and it was fun and exiting,i still get a thrill of a good set of knockers and the rest goes with out saying,i always thought this one is the greatest i ever had,but the next one was even better,its been that way all my life,i have even had girls wanna feel me up so dont be stingy
Rpg6Q37zaa	HE IS TRYNA SHOW U HE IS INTERESTED IN MORE IF YOUR FOR IT, THIS IS COMING FROM A GUY WHO USE TO DO THA SAME EXACT THING WHEN I WAS SHY, SO TO SUM IT UP HE LIKES YOU BUT HES SHY AND ISNT SURE HOW U FEEL, IF U DIGGIN HIM RETURN THA FVOR OR JUST ASK HIM TO GO TO LUNCH SOMETIME|`|it7C6nFSaa	to me i think he's just trying to be nice  just b-cuz sumone says hi dont mean they like u haha  get OVER ur-self|`|H9G8y1acaa	Flirt with him hard and gage his reactions. The truth will unfold.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Hmm If I were you, I wouldn't pressume that he likes me ..not untill he asked me out on a date|`|Wrf5orAuaa	He wants more.......a lot more.|`|258mrT2Paa	over friendly or gay.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	On the brink of being more.|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	Nice guy, nab him while you can. Worst case scenario you'll end up without him, which will happen if you don't try. You should ask him yo grab lunch or a coffee oe something.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	he is into you in a big way. ask him out. it is 2009 and it's ok for women to ask men.|`|e6rveQ8qaa	Maybe he's just trying to be helpful. And maybe he's just a bit more physical with people than others. Dunno about your situation. You should start giving him hints and see how he responds :)
MzqZGvalaa	Sexual frustration,  full moon, hormones, demonic possession, undies too tight, someone left the toilet seat up, just because sometimes we're just not in a good mood.  Got a problem with that (ha ha)|`|2JJLYSAKaa	are you on new diet?|`|ExZGZgX0aa	Because you are very good heart person.|`|AA10281397	Stress?
mITpAYReaa	Lol, bang her if she's hot... If it's a dude though, tell everyone and call the police. And if she is a girl and hot, what are you doing asking what you should do!!!??!!|`|mDiVxhc3aa	If she is hot doo her|`|lGdzb8aqaa	if you are in college maybe take her up on the offer, any grade under she is a child molester and should not be near any kids and should be reported.|`|H4bYFqwPaa	is she hot? or are you gay?|`|cAPf4kdIaa	r you a student? cause then there is a difference|`|fecbf408215596f591d1b18076b9611baa	First you report this person. No matter what grade you are in this will open the door to trouble. Second, if asked again you say no and inform the teacher that their behavior has been reported.|`|IA93mU9Haa	Tell someone. Don't listen to the "Do her if she's hot" answers. They're bullsh!t.    People (both male and female) only do this sort of thing to feel powerful over another human. She may say that she can't control herself and she really likes you, but you need to report this, or its just going to keep happening again. Talk to your parents or someone you trust. But you need to tell someone. She doesn't deserve to teach if she's going to try and force students to have sex with her.|`|cchnNnItaa	you need to report it!!! you dont no what could happen behind closed doors!!! so for your safety and the safety of others report it!!! what if he has said it to someone else to but they havent said anything either?
AA11542500	Sounds to me he wants to be FWB.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	He wants to be yur friend " with benefits" and not have to commit to anything to do it . I hope this helps|`|Fb11LZdOaa	He htinks yr hot but doesnt think there is a connection|`|uKYPmVG0aa	i know i'm not a guy but it was pretty easy to figure out. it means there isn't the same excitement there was when u were first going out but he still thinks ur cute|`|H5NVYoNOaa	It means he thinks you are still hot but is bored with you're personality. Sorry for the harsh answer but i just wanted to be clear.But dont be offended , im sure that ou are a great person.
515Tr0Kmaa	Well I dated a girl for 4 years who had them and they never bothered me.  I just  looked at them as a natural part of womanhood since  during puberty females hips expand rapidly and cause them.  I don't think you should worry too much.|`|O1lm79EFaa	nah, if the guy cares about you for you. He won't be worrying about your stretch marks.  They'll just be another thing for him to love lol|`|J14tPA9Eaa	only if they are down there     if you catch my drift..........|`|nA97uWdyaa	We're not flawless either. I'd kiss your stretch marks to let you know that I'm perfectly fine with them.|`|258mrT2Paa	i normally cause stretch marks so would not complain.|`|Rpg6Q37zaa	ANY REAL MAN WONT GIVE A FUCC OR LOOK AT HIS GIRLS FAULTS AS A BAD THING AND IF HE DOES HE ISNT A REAL MAN|`|7Bmf624Eaa	i dont mind em|`|dpCWHwUVaa	just as long as there aren't a ton of them and/or not visible from space, I think it's fine, and showing them (at least around ur bf) shows a bit of confidence in you with your body...that doesn't mean you should show them off all the time, cuz then-instead of showing confidence, it shows ignorance to your imperfections.
xkgcYeXPaa	I don't think anything but the courts think me being obsessed with Missy isn't love but a problem! Now i can't go within a 100 ft of her|`|nCrbKAuzaa	obsession is kinda more on YOUR OWN THING!because you want that person just to think of you, be with you, bein selfish etc.  while love is taking sharing, understanding, and trusting.|`|ThfHrcc4aa	I have no idea and most likely its too complicated to explain.|`|sFdn9hIkaa	love: truly and deeply caring for and appreciating someone/something - you want to see THEM happy    obsession: truly and deeply caring for someone/something - but you want to see YOURSELF happy|`|Mya72PN4aa	Obsession my dear, is madness,sick and unhealthy habit.but love is a wonderful experience.|`|a8aZYZ3Caa	From my personal experience i'd say that you can love someone like a friend or lover,  but obsession only occurs when you are IN love but the other person isnt in love with you back.         http://www.mylittlehalo.bigcartel.com  http://www.my-little-halo.blogspot.com|`|dpCWHwUVaa	good question, I've been wondering this too.    I think the difference between love and obsession depends on three things  a: how often you NEED to see your love.  If you HAVE to see him/her every day, no matter what, or else you go insane...that's obsessed.  b: the amount of pictures you have of them.  If you have enough printed photos to cover your entire wall-and that's exactly what you did with them (the left overs you placed on your binder, in your locker, all over your office desk, etc.)...that's obsessed.  c: how often you think of them.  If it's all the time, and every single thing you see reminds you of them (for example, my gf and I started going out on 11/14/06 and I have a clock that is stuck on 11:14:06...and I NOTICED it)...that's obsessed.    If you have one out of three, your not really obsessed, but it's likely you may become obsessed soon.  If you have two, your obsessed, but it's still healthy, and you can still be save.  If you have all three, I suggest you keep that to yourself, cuz obsession usually creeps people out...which is why I never got that cologne ad (love, touch, passion, lust, Obsession, Calvin Klein)|`|rFMkFYMBaa	WHEN YOU LOVE...YOU LET THE PERSON LOOSELU WITH RESPECT AND FREEDON FOR THE OTHER PERSON...YOU ALSO FEEL FREELY FOR YOURSELF...YOU LET EACH OTHER GROW SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, SOCIALLY AMONG OTHERS...    OBSESSION... I CAN EQUATE IT WITH SELFISHNESS...YOU DON'T SEE THE PERSON AS A PERSON BUT AS YOUR PROPERTY.... YOU DON'T RESPECT THE PERSON'S FREEDOM A
DGOk3Bmlaa	Don't pressure her back into the relationship, thats for sure. Give her room and make her feel comfortable around you again, let her know that you care by doing the small little things, like carrying her books or just giving a friendly hug every now and then. Don't talk urself out, remain somewhat quiet so she kinda sees that ur really focusing on doing the job right. Best of luck to you and i hope this helped!|`|4b273ea1bcd18de731e487c9a11bbc44aa	Send her flowers, tell her how much you appreciate her. hold her hand n kiss it when she least expects it.|`|it7C6nFSaa	do cute lil things for her to show her that u care|`|Q8Z35cF4aa	Does she mean things to get better between you 2? or just things in her life?   I guess the best way to show her is to be there for her when she needs, show her you still care and don't let her forget. If you eventually see that she's not interested then move on. Accept it and move on.    I wish you the best of luck man!

VygBNA0Waa	ask him for the camera back and when  you get it back dump his ****|`|vWh7fwr3aa	You know what? You are WAY too young to be complicating your existence like that! Just ditch him now and see if you can find someone who suits you better.....  Plus, it will always be like that: you move to a new area or school, and will find the fish are different in every ocean!|`|oQTjeOekaa	firstly, if the basis of your break-up is going to be the stolen camera, make sure he actually stole it first! but if this is just the clincher as to why u should break up with him, than maybe your feelings for him aren't that strong and the relationship needs to end anyways.|`|7U8nhijRaa	do you even know for sure that he has got it  have you asked your parents if they have confiscated it from you for a reason  your parents never lie so if they say no then i would have suspitions   ask him nicely coz you know hes going to say no but if you find it at his house steal it back then dump him straight away to his face|`|a759042489672e78a2c3702afb3f5daaaa	its always nice to try new things. if you think he did it ask him. But don't just assume he did. Not everyone is a bad person.|`|NikIZsKEaa	Well first find out if he actually did and if you really care about him then stay and talk to him about it. But long distance relationships kinda suck. Plus, if new boys caught your eye then you should go for them and break up with him. We only live once anyways. Plus its not fair that you guys fight alot and if your relationship is rocky then i think it would be better to be with someone that made you happy rather then someone who possibly steals and gets you angry or sad at times.|`|uW1jJjMvaa	Well first ask yourself are you sure he stole the camera. I was in a relationship and I noticed things coming up missing. And the last person I thought it would be was my boyfriend at the time. Turns out he was using drugs. So in the end I left him. But If a man is gonna steal from you, you don't need to be with that person. All he had to do was ask to borrow it and Im sure you would have let him use it. You sound pretty young, so if I was you I would check out the other boys at school that caught your eye. Because you don't want to have to be hiding all your valuables when your bf comes over because you have to worry about him stealing stuff. That's not a relationship that's just extra work. Good luck|`|AA11307468	Why would you possibly want to be in a relationship with someone who steals from you?  Such a person clearly has no respect for you.|`|JsffWlnEaa	boys come and go.take care of you first...sounds like you can and deserve better|`|eW41wwCPaa	Well if he does that obviously you cant trust him anymore.  And Far distance relationships mostly dont work out.  So i think you shouldnt be with him anymore.|`|qHkJZHwzaa	Introduce his testicles to your foot...very harshly.    And then get a new boyfriend.|`|B7nzW4Mcaa	Break up with him, & try a new boy @ ur skool..  1 that can give u things not take things from u..|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Just be absolutely possitive that you didn't just misplace your camera.

First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.

Or if you don't want to tell him yet, just invite him and when you do tell him that you hope he will come and give a flirty smile. If you already gave invite to him, talk to him and then slip in that you are hoping he will come. Then you should tell him at the party.
515Tr0Kmaa	Lol you need to get something badd@ss like an eagle or a wolf or something.|`|TKHA5okpaa	I like bold ones kind of blocky and macho, especially on the back or stomach.   Heres what to avoid:   chinese writing when your not even asian  arm bands are bordering sissy so be careful they arent too flowery looking, more tribal looking if you must get one.  Some things will limit you with girls, even if theyre not very religious girls we wont like anything with skulls or demons or devils etc...it just makes you look immature.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i dont really care what the tattoos are because its his personal choice on what to get, i just love tattoos in general. my fiance has a bunch of tattoos, a sleve and others and i love them. to me, tattoos are very attractive, and a big turn on|`|C9cIS9gxaa	none, clean will do|`|sximwDT6aa	a tribal tattoo on one arm/shoulder :D|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I like any tattoo that a guy can give an explanation for.

szVvf7Nkaa	Give her some space and see how it goes. It could be that she is involved with someone else and she is afraid to tell you because she doesn't want to hurt you. Don't get in touch with her for a few days or wait until she calls you. She may call you and she may not. But if she does and wants to know what is really going on then you guys are going to have to talk to each other. There is a reason why you feel your best friend is growing distant and you need to know what is going on with her.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	sounds like it just may have run it's course!|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Let it go. If she is the one who became distant don't chase her down to own up to it. You confronted the situation and that is all you could have done. She avoided being truthful with you so who wants an untrustworthy friend. Let it go. Sometimes we just grow apart and in different directions and start having other interests. Focus on other friends. This will pass and you will be fine. We have no control over other people--only ourselves. Don't feel like you did something to cause it--it just happens sometimes.|`|H4UxIqe2aa	if she's not willing to make the effort don't waste your time. i have done that before, and just been hurt over again. make an effort, and if there's no response, then just be nice but accept that it might not be friends for ever sort of thing. :)|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Sometimes people just outgrow each other.  It's a sad fact of life, but you will find other close friends.|`|8bplNvAQaa	You find this happens a lot in your life,  It's just the way things go, and happens all the time.    Just carry on as normal and be how you are.  Chances are you've reached saturation point with one another, and can't be that close anymore.  You're still friends and probably always will be, and you're still close - you've probably just grown a bit more "independent" of one another.  Don't look into it too much, just accept it as the way things go.      Life has a habit of doing this to everyone - it usually occurs when one friend decides they are independent enough to not need the other so much.  This is subconscious because sometimes close friends use each other as safety nets from the world.  When the world they're in becomes less daunting this can occur.  This is common throughout your life whenever you enter a new environment.|`|CZQfjMGoaa	I Agree with Laura's response. I am dealing with a similar issue with a friend. Sounds like you are doing a lot of work in the relationship. Give it a break and try to find some other friends to focus on. If it is meant to be she will come around.
8cXAf7lCaa	I would do that exact same thing if my ex-girlfriend did that. We broke up six months ago. I think the problem is that men have these connections to women, attractions that are always there. So, he is just naturally a bit jealous. Is he interested again? Maybe, but don't jump to conclusions...|`|R2WR8hRvaa	He Is Probable Just Jealous That You Have An Other Guy. Try Talking To Him, Or Just Don't Talk About That Other Guy Around Him. Don't Push Him About Spending Time With You, Just Hang Out And If He Doesn't Reply Don't Call Him Straght Away.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	LOL...oh grow up you two!|`|UeCgFgucaa	i think he have another one .. forget him .. you cane ask me if you wanna sex .|`|yEosR5Naaa	He likes you and is jealous|`|O1lm79EFaa	aha  well sounds like he might still have feelings towards you and is a bit jealous at the thought of you with other guys    Why are you worrying about him...?  1. he's an ex  2. you said he gets angry and calls you names???    Yeah ok forget about him and move the hell on|`|Mya72PN4aa	Why are you doing this to yourself? This guy cleary does not have any feelings for you whatsoever. To me you seem to be the one who is chasing after the guy. Give him a break!!!HE IS NOT INTERESTED. ok? Now get out there and get a life.|`|dn2nHtxOaa	You shouldn't pressure people into sex, and since its on text messaging, sarcasm and jokes aren't as obvious as if you said it to him in real life. Even on the phone is better for texting if you want to subtly joke.    He probably still has feelings if your relationship hasn't had too many major kinks before. BUt just drop the sex talk until he feel ready to talk about it.|`|amuHwjhYaa	he has feelings
EALy7X7Gaa	im sure he does have feelings for you because he sounded more upset than angry. obviously he has a thing for you and it hurt alot for you to just talk to him about sex and it made him feel like you wanted to use him even though that may have not been the intention. its happened to us girls all the time. he wants to still have an emotional relationship with you not just a physical he was with you when you were a virgin and wouldnt mind being with you again.|`|6jHDwy1uaa	Um, I'm pretty sure he does. It seems like he does care, but also feels like you are using him/only want him for sex. You can really tell he did get jealous after you mentioned the other guy..|`|LrVzkhl4aa	um.. I think your still attached to your ex if you asked him about sex. the questions he asked you are right. At first, I was shocked to read that you were talking to your ex about if hes going to be horny.. this whole paragraph "Ok so my ex and i somehow i ended up talking sex a few days back, then yesterday i msgd him asking ''will you be horny tonight?'', to which he didnt reply and then i again asked him that if you dont wanna talk just tell me, to which he again he didnt reply, then i called him" says you were actually curious and more then just curious if he will be. Whats going on with him, is that you freaked him out. Sorry to sound so bitchy but you asked and need to see where you went wrong. I think he thinks you were trying to make him jealous and he felt awkward that you asked him so he didnt talk to you. I wouldnt say he has feelings for you. He may like you as a friend, or else you wouldnt be talking in the first place, right? But asking if he's going to be horny tonight is saying you want sex with him/your still interested.|`|nCrbKAuzaa	well girl you've done the wrong thing. it's pretty normal a guy would be mad after your goin to tell him that you're not virgin anymore and it's another guy who did it. you hang up on him in the phone without knowing the last statements he said. he might saying that he dont feel like replying and just wanna do it.  and its very degrading to his part that you told him that you dont wanna have sex with him. it's so obvious that he was hurt.    this is just my opinion okey?..|`|umX5sKEnaa	You say he is your Ex then why bother him.. Enjoy with your new boy.. U making him feel he is so very much needed by you, that's the reason he asked you those questions..|`|oBEBj9C1aa	Clearly, he's upset and hurt that you had sex with another guy. Therefore, yes he still has feelings for you.|`|MzqZGvalaa	What would your boyfriend think of this?  I don't know if you're serious or not.  This guy is your ex, you have a new boyfriend, but you call your ex all the time and talk sex with him?  Have I got this straight?  If you're not a trifling little slut,  then I don't know who is.  Leave the poor man alone, he knows you've got a boyfriend, so what do you want to go getting him all hot and bothered for?  Are you a prick teaser?  No, then you're planning on going through with it and cheating on the new guy-so we're back to trifling little slut again aren't we.  Or you're not serious, and just want to get a reaction.
acWyJ3t0aa	You are obviously very talented and you , like almost every female I have ever known , think that you are not datable . Beleive me when I say you are avery attractive , young lady with a gift of singing .

YEZVTDJmaa	I would say it depends on how long the two of them have been dating. If they just started dating, he could have meant something more than just looking out for her. Maybe he doesn't want to be with her anymore? I would just ask him what he meant by what he said.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	he wants you to have sex with her  take care of her needs while he's away dude|`|1P26u0naaa	Make sure she doesnt do anything stupid or keep her out of trouble. And what do you mean by he wants you to go beyond to watch out for her? i dont really get what ur trying to say

a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	You answered your own question:  You love your son more.  He should be your top priority, not your partner (After all, you aren't married, so there is no obligation there.)    And if he thinks he's going to take you away from a lot of stress, I can guarantee you will be FAR more stressed without your son!    Do what you would want to do for your son.|`|CaKu7gbAaa	You are right at your place, but if your hubby becomes happy , you can do it. But the most important is your son. Do you trust your sister-in-law that she can take care of your son properly. If yes then you can give a little thought, if no then let your hubby know that you are not coming due to your son. Just request him, make him understand he should also think for his son and you too. If he doesn't understands, then take your son too. and I think you are his wife you should openly with your feelings in front of him. make him understand like him you also want same care from him.  or just say him no, and tell him that you will prepare some good food for all them in their absence.  if he is doing you emotional blackmail by saying you ilu, then you also do the same.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	I would treat it as no biggie, even if it is. Make your partner book you in to a hotel, with room service.  If you can handle your inlaws in your house for a week you have one up on me.  I can barely handle it when we go away to our beach shack and they are there, never mind them looking at my dust and unfolded clothes. Good luck.. and i would expect him to go shopping with you if you pull the trip off without going psycho and schizzing out on old ma and pa.    If your niece is trustworthy and of age to take care of a child then I would go for it and not stress. Just take a break, its perfectly healthy for mom and baby to feel separation anxiety but it is also a healthy thing and your return will be a significant signal to him that even though you are separated, there will be reunion and that you are not going to abandon him.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	I say its only 5 hours away.  Yes you love your son.  And yes you are his mother.  No argument.  However a break is a break and yes it will probably be difficult for you, but hey its only 5 hours, not 5 weeks!. Go on, give your self a break.  Your son will be in good hands.|`|a988e41a8fd48349ca50ad88521e9ddeaa	If YOU CAN SAY NO , say it , every one has the right to say no to things that he/she know that will make him/her stress .    You have welcomed them to your house , you have been nice polite , so that's it , don't make people expect more fromyou ,that will kill you in the end , do whats right and best for you and for you only|`|d30f07a15879f4c7bb74b100b34135afaa	I assume you and your "partner" are married, as you refer to his relatives as "in-laws".   If you continue to put your son first, ahead of your husband, you may lose him.  Your son will grow up in a few short years (you'll be surprised how fast those years go) and leave to start his own family, but your husband will be with you, hopefully, until you are very old.  Yes, your son will come to visit, etc, but he must put his wife and children ahead of you (in that order).    Go with your husband.  It sounds as though you have competent people to watch your son.      I know it sounds wrong to put your husband before your child, and of course when children are very young and need you, both you and your husband must consider his needs very seriously, but in your situation, it sounds as though there is no reason why you shouldn't go.    Good Luck.|`|Eh67BAU0aa	hi, you sound like a lovely caring mother. However, you do need to take time out for yourself every so often and so long as you 100% trust the care you are providing for your son, you should go. At 22 months he will be fine, it will be harder for you. If you don't end up going on this trip can I suggest you try dating your partner once in awhile like just going to dinner etc, maybe you can work your way up to leaving your son for a night. It is okay to love your son more,lol, but you still need to make time for your other loved one, and try and be patient with his family.

LDqzP2LVaa	This is totally normal .If you really trust your girlfriend, you should not mind her seeing other guys alone.     BUT! There might be a problem if there is a certain guy that you specifically don't like/ trust. In this case, you can tell her that you trust her and that you dont mind her being with guy friends alone, but you don't like/trust this certain guy and you'd like her to stop seeing him alone.    You can also tell her to imagine it was the other way around. If there is a certain girl she doesn't like or trust, would she want you to be alone with that girl??|`|AA11307468	Your girlfriend shared a meal with a friend.  Sounds perfectly normal and acceptable to me.  How well do you know this friend?

She invites her best guy friend over you. I'd say move on.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	If he's her best friend, you should trust her.  It's probably just something that they do regularly or sometimes to hang out and catch up.  Does she know that you're jealous?  If no, you should let her know that you're a little uncomfortable that she did this, but don't overreact.    If she insists that they're just friends, all you can do is trust her.  Trust is the second most important thing in a relationship, so if you can't find yourself to trust her, then something is wrong.|`|Truakr2eaa	id feel the same as you|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	she still has a life, and if she is not married to you. then she should still enjoy.    btw he is her best friend, dinner is nothing. however, sex is a different scenario.|`|JsffWlnEaa	its normal to be jealous.but anything can happen...do some investagative work...but dont go overboard|`|ztb7OCvyaa	You're not overreacting. I'd be pissed if one of my boyfriend's chick friends came over and made dinner for him and it was just the two of them. I think that crosses a line. Dinner at home alone for two is pretty intimate and in my opinion that's the sort of thing that you only do with your significant other when you have one. Tell her it made you uncomfortable and if she cops an attitude ask her to put herself in your shoes and ask how she'd feel. I guarantee she wouldn't like it either.|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	Have you ever had a best girl friend. If you have you know the answer. If there was something more between them they'd be together as boyfriend/girlfriend. You might consider making him your friend too.|`|GpbwKmViaa	I'd feel uncomfortable too, but it's okay. At least she told you and didn't just hide it from you. Now if she didn't tell me and I found out myself, I would be outrageous. If she told you what happened, you should just let it go, because it means she cares about your thoughts and opinion and doesn't want you thinking something wrong if you find out yourself. Seems like your girlfriend is one good one.|`|Gho2CFyzaa	Wouldn't bother me at all.  I think that you are overreacting.|`|qChv1Bymaa	YES! thats pretty bad of her to do. she should have at least called you over.|`|YEZVTDJmaa	Well, if you aren't showing her enough attention she could be saying that to get it.

3lKAR9G2aa	I just crawled out of bed with my wife.  Spent most of the night snuggled in behind her.  After all these years, we instinctively know each other's moves.  I'm sorry you were alone, but keep the faith and it'll happen for you.  Keep looking, because there's no other feeling like it.|`|EJYp5fIcaa	for a little while yes but not for the whole night! ill be going round my bfs later and probs will end up falling asleep while we are snuggling up together but then i gotta go home for the rest of the night, since he has work the next day and gets up at like 6 in morning!!! :( wish it was the whole night tho!|`|h3MY4Mtnaa	No I never sleep in some ones arms if it happened they would be in my arms|`|m5gkBSGwaa	YES.

LMqjgbHoaa	Try and stay busy till Sunday! You are lucky, My Best friend of 35 years ,Moved away 6 months ago. She moved like an 8 hour drive away from me. She has been My Best friend since we were 13. We are now 48. So just imagine how much we went through together. I e-mail her,it's not the same from her being 15 minutes from me. I guess it was her and her Husbands Dream, But she should have never left me,LOL. I told her I won't see her until my Funeral now since she is so far! Time goes by fast and you don't even realize it. The funny thing is, Her Husband was My Best Friend before her, I introduced them. So I really Lost Both of my Best Friends.Then Him and My Husband really got along. So we have had a really Long Friendship and been through Marriages,divorces,deaths,Births.We are all God Parents to each others kids.Sorry I'm rambling but I know how you feel way tooo Much!|`|uceyDlWhaa	Yeah I would **** someone else too, fuckin might as well huh?|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Fix the aim on my rifle lol|`|cl6r8cGBaa	well right now im a thousand miles away from the love of my life and i know its gonna crush me more if i indulge with this feeling of being miserable.. so i just exercise my butt off, meet with my friends,seek an interest whether it be by work, music  and place..anything that would divert my attention or anything to escape the empty, lost and sad feeling.|`|aEonduUUaa	talk to other friends =)|`|GTwVNeHraa	Go shopping, Watch a good comedy with friends.|`|cvRscoQ3aa	If i were in your situation I would get out of the house and hang out with friends.|`|2XTkSV4daa	I know, I had to be separated from my best friends for 6 months this year. It really hurts, but all you can do is chat, call, and try to make some other friends so you don't have just one.|`|QDrAGIOeaa	Try not to think about it too much, to get your mind off it.|`|CBKpuMjDaa	Well I know what its like to miss someone.  My husband is in Iraq and has been there nearly a year.  I stay busy!!!! The more busy the less my heart breaks...watch movies too! I fall asleep to movies so I dont have to feel the pain of missing him.  sundays is a blink of an eye away!|`|RITOVkdAaa	Try to do things through the week to take your mind off of him. Go out with other friends, watch movies, get a job. Keep yourself busy and time will fly by a lot faster.|`|ls6WiBk0aa	buy a gift for yr friend  or study  or get busy in other work|`|PAwQLtYcaa	Try to think about him as much as you can love is good as much as you get into it ..why you should try to don`t think about it ?!!    you should fall in love as much as you can and then you won`t feel yourself and no suffrring any more..|`|9b3537c30933da7786dc8b95599adf7daa	you are probably in love with him if you miss him this much.
3OI0jLfSaa	You go takl to him n ask him whats up if he says something tell her.  also if it doesnt work ask his mate to do it.  or just tell her to ask him out.                  gurd luck.x3|`|eO429roGaa	PPPPPLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSEEEEEE!!...    Get a life child|`|qMKy50ozaa	She will get over him in a little time. Tell her if he's doesn't have the time for her then she shouldn't be wasting her time on him.
tXlvg1ahaa	My grandma always told us this trick they used to do on men in the old days when she was a teenager.    First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.  She says that this uncertainty sparks a man's interest and keeps them pursuing the girl until she gives in.|`|Gho2CFyzaa	I cant believe that I have just read your question.    You are asking how to stop someone from living their life because he would break up with you.    Just say you are successfull in making him stay with you and not going to University - there is a domino effect - he will eventually resent you as hedidn'tt get to do what he wanted in life.    Would you really like to be with someone who is miserable and depressed every day because they are working in a job that they dont really enjoy when they could have followed their dream career but instead decided to throw it all in because of your insecurities?      Sounds to me that this relationshipwouldn'tt work out anyway.  If you truly loved him, you would wish him luck and send him on his way.  He would love you more for that as well.|`|30nzrpnCaa	nothing...inevitable means there is nothing to do to change it. plus you can't force someone out of doing what they want. if he loved you enough he'd stay with you. otherwise he's over you and ready to screw around with other girls.    plain truth|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	"let's not deny the inevitable.."|`|JsffWlnEaa	not much really.maybe move in with him or closer to him...|`|RKlMDz4Eaa	have a lot of sex with him
uIUXpteMaa	there is no problem just dopnt think much  u like him thats okay  and y will ur brother hate that   he is his frd !!!  just chill...|`|B7nzW4Mcaa	I dont think you should date him 1st off cuz his ur brothers friend, and what if something goes wrong, 2nd cuz ur cuzin dated him thats a big no no..
LPX6E5e5aa	na not weird at all man persue it ..it could b something so special and u wouldnt wanna miss out ..lifes 2 short chance it bro!!|`|U6RtrD5taa	extremely    have you seen photos of her?  they could be of someone else...you don't KNOW her!|`|707gOCvbaa	It's not weird but do you really want a long distance relationship  where you really know nothing about the person?  It's different if you met and kept in touch. Just let it flow and see what happens.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	If the other person is across the US, I'd hardy call that more than a long distance friendship.|`|MRwb4jQYaa	Yes!  DON'T DO IT!  that's creepy.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	I think YES, its weird! You don't know her but you chat with her? Definitely weird! =D|`|nsVbWXKraa	well she lives across the u.s why would you ask that... what are the chances of actually meeting her and dating her? very slim|`|gzERnclQaa	Anything is possible.  Long distance relationships take more work than a normal relationship due to the lack of physical contact.   But with the phone, email, instant messenger, web cam and going to meet, you can develop a relationship.  My fiancee and I met in a yahoo chat room.  I'm presently planning another trip to go visit her again and she is 1/2 around the world.  It all depends on what you both want.|`|ZS5FI34waa	yes that is pretty weird|`|6jHDwy1uaa	have you seen how she looks.. ?|`|HlzL6sdqaa	No, I think it's fine, although many people would disagree. The person I like I met over the internet, we talk on the phone and everyday... As long as the relationship has a lot of trust and it's DEFINITELY real then it's fine|`|M4E9XIFgaa	It works for some people just make sure she is who she says she is its easy to play a different role on the other line and/or send pictures of someone different.  But go for what your heart tells you!|`|gv7unj2Waa	its stupid..i met this girl here and it was a waste of time...its not something i would recommend.|`|JMieQrgXaa	Well...do you know what she looks like??? is she for real??? I guess you can meet her and then figure it out on your own. Good luck!|`|EccdNc8maa	No its not weird,however it depends on how you take it seriously or you jjust want to make friends.Its just like before having penpals through writing now its advance computer generated dates.anyway goodluck for the search of Ms.Right.|`|OgQG7oNOaa	well I know love can be unpredictable, however you need to actually be together to call it dating, to me it sounds like to desprate, lonely, singles who need someone to feel secure, you can call her a friend, or a chat buddy but dating without ever actually going on a date. How does that not sound weird.
sQIcCVjAaa	If this is the only downside to your relationship of 3 years it doesn't sound like much of an issue. But if there's more to this than what your saying then only you can decide if he's a bad bf or not. based on what you've said alone, it just sounds like he was just being silly.. With some pretty bad jokes|`|4glrvKh9aa	No, it just seems like you're taking a lot of what he says too personally. He's dissing your ringtone... not you. Take it as that! And he probably got a little jealous because you were on the phone which is why he said that, but you seemed to overreact if you ignored him for a day because of it.    Take a chill pill :)|`|Srf801JCaa	naw dude, cows don't wear uniforms... I think......|`|J14tPA9Eaa	wait are you a cow?|`|nCrbKAuzaa	OMG!. well here's a thing, there is a possibility that your guy is jealous.  you know guys are secretive. they tend to hide their real emotions and never let you know. they'll just goin to say a word without thinking if you're goin to hurt you or not because it's their way of letting you know that he was jealous. just talk to him and tell him that you got offended with what he did. and i know he'll understand you.|`|QGQV9hvLaa	he's just trying to be cool infront of his friend  all guys are like that   its stupid   dont worry about it|`|5uUSJNSLaa	if he said he was sorry that it was just a joke, is okay. i mean, cant u take a joke? dont b so hard on him :)|`|KgOvoFThaa	maybe he dun lyk u or he may be just playing with u or u r just 2 sensitive. if u really want to noe the truth tok 2 him...u may try if u wan it work 4 me n my bf
oEUjPGsUaa	maybe something happened to her on valentines day.. lol  or she just never had a valentine so she doesnt like it.  if shes your type, go for it why not
KKyMQlrkaa	You say you have 5 kids but you dont say how long you have been married.  I'm assuming your husband does not work!   If this has been going on for 3 years, what was he like before?  It is very easy to assume he is just being lazy, which of course he could be but is it possible he may be ill?  Men have a tendency not to say anything if they are depressed etc.  Yes, man flu, we all know about that one but when it comes to something serious, they do tend to not say very much, if anything at all.    It must be so very hard for you, doing everything and bringing up 5 children and you need the support and love of your husband.  Of course if he is just a lazy so and so then go and get a cold bucket of water, with his name on it.  Serioulsy though, as i said, what was he like before?  Thats the big question, as of course only you will know if he has always been lazy or if he was a very lively man, hard working etc..    Only you can have the anwser, im afraid.    If you feel he may be ill, by looking at your past together then you must, no matter how hard get help for him. By doing this, you will actualy be helping yourself as you will eventualy get the husband back, that you know and love.    Of course if he is just a lazy so and so, then think about if you really need this, you have enough to cope with and if thats the case then you must do something about it, whatever the problem for your own sanity.    You obvioulsy don't communicate very much in your marriage or is that just lately? That could be a big give away if its just of late.    Please try and talk to your husband, when  and if you get the time and then after everything, if nothing changes and he still does not get out of that bed, then you have to do what is right for you.  It is hard enough for you now, bringing up 5 kids but please do consider that he may be ill but of course only you can know that by looking at what he was like before he took to liking his bed.    good luck|`|U5IigAByaa	as alot of people i thought lazy sod, but then i remembered one of my friends has some time of sleep disorder where her body thinks she needs like 18 hrs a day sleep. Get him checked out just in case, and if not, revert back to the bucket of water idea!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Does he work?    If so, obviously he's working evenings or nights.  He needs 8 or 9 hours of sleep like everyone else.    If he's not working, he could be very depressed.  You need to demand he go to the doctor, and get himself sorted out.    Love does not mean you should be with someone.|`|aZFu4nZeaa	So he doesn't work then?  He needs a reality check, real fast.  It's called a hose through the window and blow his lazy **** out of that bed.   I am assuming you cook and wash his clothes?  Don't do it!!! Let him fix his own meals, coffee etc ... don't bake for him, and don't was his clothes.  Don't pay his bills ... don't do anything for him at all.|`|n05GDUcUaa	throw a bucket of freezing water over the lazy sod, that should make it clear how sick you are of him being lazy  :)|`|BI8c6XXPaa	Maybe he has a medical condition. See if he will go to the doctor about it. Try and wake him up early one morning with the smell of bacon and coffee. If that doesn't work, maybe he has a sleep disorder.|`|28HLij60aa	Up til two weeks ago my other half worked two jobs, one in the day, the other on nights.     This went on for five years, until two weeks ago when the day job was made redundant.     Since then, he's been in bed until 1-ish in the afternoon. I suppose I shouldn't complain but it's a pain in the bum when you need to get all the housework done and take care of the kids. I suppose I should count myself lucky I have only one child but it IS awkward.     If he works nights though, the most you can do is just leave him until he gets up. Otherwise....kick his backside out to try and find a job.     Even more frustrating is, his night job is on a rota system where he does three on, three off, and each shift is 12 hours long.   Even on the mornings where he hasn't worked the night before, he lays in bed until when it suits him...AARRGGH!!     He does work hard though and I do love him to pieces. I'll just have to learn how to change the bed AROUND him hahaha! xxx|`|0a3e8afcef784f7c3fadf1171e01b3e0aa	I'd pull back his bedclothes and put ice cubes or a cold flannel on him!  Seriously, make as much noise as possible and hoover round the bedroom etc. Make it as uncomfortable as possible for him to lie in.    Try persuading him to have some early nights so he at least gets his proper sleep.    He could be suffering from depression, so make him an appointment with the GP.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	He is obviously without a job or he would not be able to spend so much time in bed unless he is on nights of course.  He could be depressed because he is not working, instead of getting angry about all of this try having a serious talk about things instead of shouting and getting annoyed or pointing the finger at all his faults.  Say the kids miss him and would like to see more of him, you could do with a bit of help around the place and you are worried about the amount of sleep he needs.  Start communicating and see how he feels about things, it does not have to be laziness, depression comes in many forms and sleeping patterns are the first to be affected.  You could always have a word with your GP and see if an appointment with him could help.  Instead of being angry try to work out why this is happening, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.  Good luck.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Buy an air horn, open the bedroom door and HONK IT ! Remember to have a camera ready to picture his face !|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Doesn't he work?|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	hope he aint changing into a vampire hon hehe~]|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	zoe theres a door kick him out of it now ..or put up with it .. its your call..|`|AA10811426	Does he work?|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	You gotta focus on the issue/stress of not feeling equal in the household. Staying up / sleeping late is a symptom and so making it into the problem is kinda inaccurate.    It sounds like something has got to give.. Relationships require negotiations and re-negotiations. But take your logic to the next level and work out what is the brass tacks real reason you are getting mad and or maybe panicked.     Cause the time difference between 9 and 1 is only 4 hours.  And if this works with his job schedule.. I'm just saying there is something else peeving you off that needs attention. That 4 time gap is prolly not what is jeopardizing the marriage.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	well, obviously u haven't tried withholding sex, but you seem to be pretty good at withholding all the relevant info that's needed to give u a good answer to ur question.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Does he have a night job and that is why he sleeps in so late?  Does he have a physical illness that is causing him to sleep so long?  Does he suffer with some type of depression?    You really need to give us more information.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	Assuming he is just lazy and needs to get up....Try    Marbles - frozen marbles.  Just toss a cup of frozen marbles in bed with him under the covers- they find any exposed skin and unlike ice or water they clean up easy.  He will get up - if he doesn't, he is dead!
NCGcY5VSaa	Flip through the newspaper.
oAXelgSXaa	lol well i kinda like this one    hey, see my friend over there(point to a friend) he wants to know if u think im cute.|`|kAfZaLwraa	Got any raisins?... how about a date?     The other ones I know are really rather vulgar.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	"Hi" works best for me.    Don't need to get fancy just to get a guy to give me his number. :-D|`|adQWVOeAaa	as in a joke pickup line?    Dang girl, were you born on a chicken farm?    because you sure are good at raising cocks.    if you are looking for serious... then I have no idea. I think they all sound pretty cheesy.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	An old guy in Hollywood Video said this to me one time:    Guy: Did it hurt?  Me: What hurt?  Guy: When you fell from heaven.
JsDHeWiZaa	yeah at eighteen, twenty seven is too old for you.  i would say max should be 22. - if you were 27 and he was 36, maybe - but thats still a little old.|`|AA11635397	I say do it. u not a baby. or are u|`|Iq0ZW0vVaa	nah..he is too old for you
mxrlZEweaa	Just tell them that it is your decision that you don't want to have sex and if they were your real friends then they wouldn't pressure you into doing something you don't want to do. I think it's great that you don't want to have sex at such a young age, you have so much more to live for than unwanted pregnancies, STD's, and all the craziness that goes along with it.|`|m0WUEtqXaa	You need new friends....because real friends don't insult you or condemn you because of your decisions but they know that you are mature enough to make up your own mind and respect your decisions. Hey I'm a virgin and im 22, none of my other friend are but they respect my decisions and even look up to me sometimes.|`|AA12294846	just tell them that you are not yet ready 4 all this...!!
ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	There is nothing you should do.

d8mJAuz1aa	vergin = a women that never had sex  non-virgins = a womenthat had sex with men. or even she did some hard word and broken her verginty.    we have only one life dont loose that is perious in life and run in big highway that people run up and down    human life do not have UNDO button. life is serious and have only one. take care a lot.

smEPI9G2aa	First off he is a guy, so don't read to much into it.  Conversation is not very many mens strong suit.  If you like him and want to talk with him, just converse like you have been.  I would not make too much out of it.  He may not be trying to come off like an ***, but not be a good communicater.  And lets be honest...I think he would know if he had left his shirt at your place, so he obviously wants to talk with you to some degree.|`|BKjiDrHyaa	Hi Lana,     Simple, just ignore him for few dates and then you'll see the fun. Its not fair to if he is showing such attitudes. Then, he will respect for coming date or worst case tell hin F**K OFF.     Regards   Saran|`|8gWqRvJXaa	honestly...seems like he just really wants his shirt back... nothing else
YmW8G5Abaa	1 : Go to the type of place you would go to then find a girl there. That way the girl will be into what you are into.   2 : build up the courage go up to her and talk to her.   3 : On the Date BE YOURSELF but never be to mushy mushy on the first date.     Good Luck|`|CdTe8MO4aa	kids are so clueless in school   you could meet the girl u had a crush on 10 years now and use 2 talk and you say wow i had a crush on you and she would say wow really i didn't know i wish you would of said something|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Local parties, networking, MySpace, Facebook, friends of friends, etc.|`|eW41wwCPaa	going to partys :D|`|0ba4c9ff30dbd5fcca6962160c91d3c2aa	Do you have friends who are friends with girls in other schools?

2mOlMKbiaa	Hey, your going to have to take a break. You didnt go from "hey whats your name?" to "I love you" in a hour--so its going to take a little bit to get through this. I started to go to the gym like a mad man---basically bettering myself for myself and then the next girl got to benefit as well. Find something that you like to do. It dosnt have to be cloubbing--that just numbs the pain for a minute then it starts over again. Find something substantial. Something that is all about you. Its time to do something for you not two.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	I think you should not talk to your ex for awhile. If you keep thinking about him you will take longer to get over him. To mend a broken heart, you need to take time and get over your hurt. Have you heard of the stages of grieving? You will have to go through the stages to heal.|`|tHYC3uPOaa	I am going thru a "broken heart" situation right now.  We got back together and he re broke it !  So it hurts and I know what you are feeling.  I have chosen to distance myself.  I will admit it is very very hard. we have a small community and I just saw him last Friday at little league.  My heart still skipped beats.  He even texted me and told me how good I look and that I have lost alot of weight.  I can barely eat.  Good Luck.  And again while it may be hard, no communication is better at least for now.|`|DzXDJCfZaa	Just do fun stuff with friends, flirt with guys if you want. Until you find an amazing guy.    Im friends with most of my ex's  We just act like nothing happened and we are friends
muHctmaGaa	"Tried many tricks"... you think you have to get women by tricking them?|`|WNskx1JGaa	Lol. I am a female but you have to dress nice and portray yourself as D.I.F.F.E.R.E.N.T make yourself stand out from every other taxi cab driver.     Honestly when I think of a taxi driver I think of a fairly unattractive guy but thats because the ones that I have mostly seen were average looking and not my type. But that was very stereotypical of me.    Be friendly keep a nice smile and be caring. Dress nice and smell fresh!!! Just be a man and that will attract ladies. It wouldnt hurt if you try to talk to women more, we like men who dont give in. That shows that you really care.|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	you need to meet new people and socialize. you shouldn't be shy around people and flirt a little.|`|OXKF0jbtaa	Nothing is wrong with you, I once read a Question on here about a 40some year old guy who hadn't experienced a first kiss yet!    If you really believe it's a cultural issue, maybe try a culturally based dating service. Or just ask one of your good buddies to set you up on a blind date. Are you in college? Girls are EXTREMELY easy to pick up in college, especially when they're wasted at frats. I mean, it's not the most honorable way to kiss a girl, but if you want immediate experience, that's probably a good place to go.    Just make yourself presentable (good hair, clothes that look good for your body, and good breath) and smile and make eye contact. You could try being a little more bold, seeing as most girls do expect a guy to make the first move. Stay positive, you're fine dude :)|`|AA11840819	Maybe you are asking out the wrong women.  Enlarge you horizon.  Be kind and don't try the tricks just be honest.  Search out new friends.  If you have a friend who is a woman ask her what she thinks you need to do.  Good luck!|`|7f0c57a2fb085459b00d18056fa02f8caa	being a cab driver is the best solution to get the girls. I am in Middle east as well and could guess that cab drivers get more chances to be with girls than a person working in male only company.    its only your hesitation to talk to girls. once you are used to it you will find out that it was very easy.    there are lots of female passengers who will talk to you easily and it will be your starting point to know someone.|`|8sWdrYvVaa	There are plenty of things wrong with society, but the only one that applies in your case is that people in their 20s suddenly lose most of their friends and support system once they get out of school.    Go out clubbing with what guy friends you do have and just take it easy.  Join some sort of club that will introduce you to new people.
oGoWz511aa	Oh, go grow some balls.  She asked you for a divorce, but you begged her not to.  Now, you have someone else you want to marry, and you're afraid to bring it up... because you love her, and don't want to disturb her.  I think you're more worried that she say no.  That's why you're wondering if it would just be OK to marry this other woman... because there's NO PROOF of your marriage.      Go ask her for a divorce.  Even offer to pay for it, and let her choose the grounds.  She'll probably be relieved.  Then go marry your new girl.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	get a divorce and start living your life stop wasting precious time!|`|AA12014364	Discuss with a divorce lawyer. It is better to get your divorce papers to save yourself from the hassle later if she ever comes back to you and says she is your wife. Annul the marriage and start with a fresh slate.|`|E56MF3p6aa	Get divorce leagelly if you married her leagelly, instead of leaving thing like this as this will only creat chaos for your futrue live. If you think you can manage then you can go ahead. As you know as per Hindu Law, Man can't keep two wife in one time.|`|JOjaycXLaa	First of all I'm sorry for your loss. I'm also in the same situation as you. I know you want her to be happy even if it's not with you. Then you know what you have to do is to file for a divorce. You will find someone who really loves you one day. You see our time here is a gift you are not promised tomorrow! If you got hit by a car tomorrow & died would you regret all the time you wasted trying to make this women love you even though you know she never will? Or would your time on this earth have been better spent looking for a new wife. Someone that will love you back the same way? Think about.  Get the devorce & the sooner you start getting over her the better you will feel. Good luck!|`|fc1a879190d20993471e9ab52be8c605aa	You need to get a divorce before you marry another person, otherwise you could be prosecuted for bigamy. If you want to give the marriage some time. That is one option. I am not sure of you are asking if a license from another country applies in the US. The general rule is "yes" as long as it does not conflict with our laws. Ex. underage marriage or bigamy.    Whoever said annul the marriage, an annulment isn't the same as a divorce. An annulment declares a marriage invalid because all the requirements were not fulfilled.    I hope I helped.
c2YcBbXyaa	clothes, toothpaste, deoderant, shampoo, maybe a bar of soap, but i think you can probably find soap in public restrooms....try to find truck stops where they have public showers...bring a sleeping bag if you have one and can carry it around with you..maybe get a shopping cart to put all your stuff in.....keep your eyes open for a big box that you can fit into for shelter against the weather....i don't know where you live now, but try to get to someplace with a warm climate like forida, that way you can camp out on the beach all the time and won't need shelter so much....adopt a stray dog for company and protection as well as warmth at night....and also wear your most comfortable shoes since you'll be walking a lot.....|`|VL1NGMKraa	I wouldnt try to talk you out of it but seriously...what are you gonna do become a prostitute? You'll be snatched up by some sicko in seconds out there and they will abuse you emotionally and physically worse than your parents.   If you arent happy at home report your parents or take some kind of legal action with the state and move in with a friend.  Do you have a job?  How will you eat?  Its cold outside this time of year, bring warm clothes.  Oh yea...dont forget your box to sleep in at night on the street...    Oh yea...did you hear recently about the homeless man that was lit on fire and murdered by another begrudged man? People these days arent kind to the homeless...    Where will you shower? The park with all the nuts out there?       Dont forget some pepper spray to keep away the pedofiles and rapists and drug dealers... Maybe some sort of weapon...    Dont do anything too illegal and get caught...you're almost old enough to be put in jail...  They'll treat you worse in womens jail...but hey...if you dont believe me you can just find out for yourself...|`|1F4ILBYVaa	I'm not going to try to talk you one way or the other.  But if you want a friend (shoulder to lean on) to talk to..  Give me a msg.|`|7sMOh0V6aa	uhhhhhhh...why does every teen think they have it worse? Bring a phone that way you can call your loving parents to pick you up after you find out the hard way.    My father beats my autistic brother. He even slammed my younger 6 yr old brothers face against the wall. Frequent visits from the police. Oh did I mention we lost out house? Oh yeah and we make less than 30,000$ a year because my dad is a custodian.     Oh one more thing, my college money was lost when we lost our house.     seriously.|`|jX2a2mKUaa	dont forget your tooth brush!|`|arVdbgBlaa	Well do u even have a place your going too? Your situation at home is messed up and im not gonna tell you what to and not to do but honestly I hope u have a place to go to and as for your question I guess your birth certificate and social security card are vary important documents other than that clothes and cash if you have any    Good luck|`|oM7bXmkvaa	Sweetheart, do you really think you have it worse then other people?  My cousin is dying from cancer, Aunt is paralyzed, one Cousin has a brain tumor and could one day never wake up.Other cousin had a baby and it died, And now she is in jail. I am not going to even start with whats going on in my life!    You seriously should stay, its not worth it.  When I ran, I never came back. I was forgotten, even though I was miserable.I regret ever leaving.    Your gonna need money.    Im not trying to convince you not to go , because i dont care. Just sharig some life stories|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Your parents are probably mad because you are not in school. So you better look for a job first. If you don't know where you are going to, you better pack everything, all clothes/books/music/computer etc. Then I guess if you find somewhere to stay you will have to buy stuff for your apartment, bed/sheets, chair, plates, that sort of thing. Your apartment will probably need a couple of months' rent up front and there may be utilities too. $2000 should cover it to start with. But get a job before you go anywhere.|`|AKv1gj0Xaa	Your folks' phone number, for when you discover you really can't run away from your troubles.
oEYrC1Wsaa	It's called INCEST if she really is yr friend then you have 3 options, 1.   Sit down & tell her it is illegal.    2.    Do nothing & stay away, until she asks why you haven't been in contact.  3.  Tell her parents for her own good (although this could risk yr friendship), think long & hard as it is a very uncomfortable subject to raise no matter whom you discuss it with.    It is very unhealthy & her older brother should know damn well it's not right.|`|cl6r8cGBaa	omg that's gross!  if you want a concrete answer you better talk to her or else this might affect your relationship with her.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Don't tell her...just...get away...fast O.o|`|75SSAFsPaa	Yes a friend of mine admitted she was having sex with her brother and I never could look at her brother in the face again ( had a little crush on him before she told me ) after that I just felt like throwing up..People at school eventually found out and no decent guy would go out with her and He never could hook up with a healthy relationship.To her and him it might just seem like experimentation.But it can change her future and his unless they plan to have people in their lives that they never tell which is starting a relationship off on bad ground and believe me just like with you people will find out.If you really want to help her I would mail her this and let her decide for herself if the thrill is worth the rest of her life not having a healthy relationship|`|sibFhZyWaa	No, I`ve never seen anything like that, but if I did, I`m sure I would let them know that I was aware of it. As for the friendship, I think something like that would pretty much dissolve it. Sorry ...|`|52otNiElaa	i would be like "whoa what a trip"|`|oEUjPGsUaa	=O whoa.|`|qMKy50ozaa	Tell their parents ASAP.|`|mA9NZtsHaa	Ask her wtf that was about and let her know that's gross and she is weird the get away from the freaks fast! and find yourself a new best friend|`|giIRzafsaa	you shoulda joined in. it woulda been the best story in collage. either that or get you video camera and blast that stuff on you tube. sounds hot. they are doing more then kissing i can tell you this. i got a whole platoon of guys(about 30 guys) to admit to having sex with either their blood or step sister or a cousin or something in the family. or if they hadn't had the nerves to try, they would have had sex with them. its funny how if you make something that is totally taboo, an accepted act, every one admits to doing it.
Sl0iE8cbaa	Be direct and ask her out!! Some flirting before hand wouldn't hurt.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I would prefer something else like a general conversation first.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	We hate it when guys use the terms "pretty, cute, hot, sexy, etc.". We LOVE it when a guy says "beautiful". So if you wanted to get a girl to say yes I would highly suggest you saying "I like you a lot and I think you're beautiful. Would you want to go out with me sometime?"     We usually like it when guys are straightforward and don't play games a lot. We enjoy when guys are flirty and are cute, plus when they have the courage to ask us out.    So I would say go for it!
515Tr0Kmaa	I get like that around females that I think are out of my league and that I have a crush on. So perhaps he gets choked up around you because he thinks you're out of his league.|`|d8mJAuz1aa	take care of your life.   undo butto in not active in human life.|`|E8QzbqWPaa	Well it's either he likes you and gets really shy and nervous around you or he's an ***.   But I'd advice you not to think about his actions too much so you don't get all paranoid about it. Just leave him be.|`|ja7J2cE2aa	This guy is suffering from a rather common condition known as "shy."  Men sometimes feel this way towards girls they feel an attraction for, while they act completely normal around girls they have relatively little interest in.      You can help alleviate his pain by either talking to him more, or just ignoring him completely if you're not interested.  You don't seem to trust him very much, despite the fact that he sounds completely harmless, so I would suggest you go with the latter option here.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Guys don't act like that. He acts like that.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	move on. sound like a player.|`|UeCgFgucaa	not all guys .. try me|`|Wcib0PTYaa	maybe he loves you and may be not|`|szcA8CDyaa	he might likes u or something|`|it7C6nFSaa	maybe he has a crush on u|`|9NwPPYXZaa	maybe because the other girls he talks to are probably slutty and he probably think hes not gonna get somethin outta you..
eMtH8IAwaa	if he has a gf then, no, don't try to talk about dating. if you want to be friends only, that is fine. but do not enter into that while loving him. i did that and then was surprised when the guy dumped his gf...he did not date me. if it is just friendship, get that right in your mind. it will lead to less hurt later.     now, why did he move on? who knows. maybe he met someone with a deeper connection, maybe he was dying to make out with someone, it could be any reason. the fact is, he did not wait. so stop waiting for him.     try to limit contact with him. this helps people move on. also, it will hurt a lot. you will cry a lot. but every day the pain will go down. try to have hobbies, read, listen to music, watch TV, and have a normal life. even if you don't feel like it. make yourself go through the motions. this helps you function. eventually, you will be distracted from the heartache. plus, when the time is right, you may meet a new person! have a ball and i bet this guy will regret missing out on dating you.|`|RI0jvUjWaa	I usually talk to the person if the opportunity presents itself, but I always try to seem confident and as if I don't really care and I'm okay with the situation even if I'm not. It's an ego booster for the guy if he knew you missed him...in my experience the guy is the one who usually looks awkward and uncomfortable plus if he thinks you've moved on it gives him a chance to think about the situation and possibly feel bad or attempt to talk to you.     I did this and the guy is still calling me three years later and I've been in a different relationship for two years. I think that's a special case, plus there was a lot more to do with the situation, but still, acting confident and not letting your "hurt" show I think is the best thing.    Hope this helps! Feel better!|`|bg20Nmwmaa	sometimes the best way to get over a guy is just willpower...force yourself to move on, and look ahead and forget about the past.  you can do this by avoiding him for a bit until your more stable...or you could just totally move on and find a new guy...there are plenty of guys out there, and even though you might think that this guy is the PERFECT guy for you, there will be many more "perfect" guys to come...it sometimes takes a little patience. but once you are able to face him, i would suggest talking to him about how you feel, but remember to not blame it on him that he has a girlfried...and also try to keep it chill, dont make a big scene, and over time, you will patch up your relationship.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	Whether or not you think you should try to get back with him is totally up to you, but if you wanna move on just go out and meet new guys. You'll eventually find someone else you like if you keep looking.|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Why didn't you told him before that you had to leave for awhile?    What would you think if he just disappeared for 4 months and then suddenly showed up again?  Wouldn't you feel like he deserted you?  I guess that's the way he feels right now.    I don't believe you really love this guy, because you would never have left him behind like that.  So, forget him...he is not the one that will ever be yours.    -R|`|XTwI4F64aa	Sorry to say this but you should move on since he is ignoring you and won't even look at you. In addition, don't see him anymore. That guy has no patience! There is a better man out there waiting for you. Be patient. Don't feel upset. Go and catch a movie, go out with your friends, take up a course, exercise. Keep busy.|`|3NNWSpDraa	try and talk to him about it, be brave and confront him about how he feels, does he still have feelings for you? does he want to be with you? does he really have a girlfriend?? and he will make his feelings clear and then take it from there.    just tread lightly, dont be harsh and bitchy unless he asks for it..im sorry, you mst have that horrible dreading gut feeling! be brave! goodluckm =)|`|6DB0MckAaa	Hunny, let it go.  He already has a girlfriend.    He had no reason to wait for you or you wait for him because you guys never came into an agreement.  It's clear that to him, it was just a crush, nothing more.  To prove my point, he got himself a girlfriend without any hesitation.   Why should he hesitate, he had nobody to wait for, am I right?    So to answer your questions:  - You will stop feeling awful until you choose to leave him alone and accept the fact that he is not for you because he is for someone else.  Yes, you will shed a lot of tears. Let all those emotions out on your own. Cope with yourself.  - Ignore him. Move on.  You can't work it out, because again, he already has someone else. You don't want to be the 'rebound'.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	try and talk it out.|`|zPUCFtpfaa	Best way to stop feeling bad is to talking to some new guys. I know its really tough right now, but really, nothing helps more. Try talking to other guys, see what happens.|`|5VioO7YTaa	yes you should talk to him if that doesnt work call him a jerk and walk away
3PlT64Yuaa	Well, you two seem compatible enough, so don't jump into thinking that there is a problem with you. I had a girl that I liked, and she liked me, but when she was going through rough times in her life, she needed her space and I gave it to her.     Give it at least a few more weeks, if nothing turns up, he probably found someone else. Let him know somehow that you still think about him, though.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	May have been tired of playing games.  May have just given up thinking you didnt like him back.  or he could have found someone else.|`|nsVbWXKraa	He was sick of chasing.... that was the girls mistake not taking to great of interest.... he will just move on and look for another girl|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Maybe you never showed any signs back and just decided he was scared he was starting to look silly. Or maybe he found someone else, who knows? You should ask this guy.|`|C3yE261uaa	I think you are talking about an a***le not a real guy well in that case as soon as another chick comes on his way|`|pUtlF7gbaa	how many times have i seen this before.  i think that he felt like he was not getting enough attention or signals and decided either you didn't like him or didn't like him enough.  alot guys like girls who take the initiative.  (take charge, be forward.  just don't become bossy or obnoxious or..scary.)|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Why do guys appear to "lose interest?" Any number of reasons, not all of them "good ones," some of  them "really lame."    IMHO, a six month acquaintance entitles you to talk to him and bring the subject up, as in, "Hey, is it my imagination or do you seem a little distant lately?"    Guys are remarkably fragile, particularly when it comes to their pride and their need to be admired, especially by females.    Good luck and best wishes.|`|1HkTZy9paa	ASAP|`|PuopJHPcaa	actually the first time a guy sleeps with a woman itself atleast 50 percent of the interest in gone  i mean interest in that woman

meisgiZBaa	drop. it. like. its. hot.       seriously, bro. if she's 15, she doesn't know her *** from her foot yet. don't feel guilty and find another girl.|`|8FLJueRjaa	shes 15 she doesnt know what the hell love is...  drop it and move on    its all about seeing how many rocks u can let offf    so go and get with someother girls  and maybe come back to her later|`|ZVngHOBTaa	some girls are just like that, they cant help flirting. personally i do it naturally and dont realise that im flirting. You have to decide if you can deal with her flirting with guys, cos if u cant handle it then there is no point in your relationship as you will both fight constantly.   do not feel guilty about breaking her heart, she will get over it lol|`|dNJG3EDCaa	DUDE, your in a royally messed sitiuation. If i were you, i'd try to get more details about the flirting and see how serious it is. If its harmless flirting, then she just has problems like that (a lot of girls do, leads to rape cases all the time). Its it hardcore stuff, and actually lead to ****, then leave her out to dry, because shes just messing with you. Shes treating you like the back up man, there when she ain't getting attention from everyone else.|`|BJuwGkUJaa	Well you have to go with your heart, sounds like your both really young.  She loves the attention some girls just flirt. You have to decide whether or not you can live with it. I suggest you experience a variety of girls  and you'll learn about all kinds of  personality and will take that into adult hood and thats were you'll find true love.  good luck  cb|`|XZSp2ORPaa	15! No girl at that age knows what she wants, think back why you broke up to begin with. Shes so young and immature, You didnt say how old you were. It is natural for girls and boys to flirt, but to act on it and take it another step further, no. You both need time away to test  your feelings for each other, and if it was meant to be, you'll be back together. If so you gota lay some ground rules, but it has to be both ways, im not saying control her, you cant, but tell her dont flirt around you or do whatever shes doin for some random guy to text you. You were only with her for 3months, your gona have many many girls, play the field for awhile, but remember what broke you both up!

a1b7e7748fe864b4bfe2e265ef2514c6aa	It is very hard to fix this - unless your dad is accepting of your life and your right to live it the way you want - perhaps someday when you marry and have children then he may soften some to know that he has grandchildren - some parents want to control the lives of their children until they take their last breath - perhaps your dad is this way?  Concentrate on living your life and living it well and being happy as you are for now and try again a bit later to contact him - you have offered the olive branch to  him - its now up to him to lose some of his pride and make contact back|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	Most dads will give in when you tell them you love them and only want their love in return. Asian men are different sometimes. They will love you but they can not bring themselves to say it in fear of loosing face. Just be happy by telling him you love him and that you are sorry for bringing disgrace on the family and hope that he can find it in himself to forgive you.
64d77l4qaa	I've been just friends with plenty of women.  In my senior year of high school, my best friend has been female.    There have been a couple female friends I ended up dating, but far more that I did not.    Your experiences are just unfortunate ones. It is entirely possible for nonsexual friendships to exist between men and women. The guys who told you that they love you, what THOSE guys really wanted was to get close to you. Most likely they started out the relationship in love or with a crush on you already.    Be careful you're not sending out the wrong message to your guy friends. Once they think you're interested in them it will be difficult for you to get that thought out of their minds.|`|50zbKv0jaa	guys really want sex  they can suppress it for a while  but they want sex|`|X4dMZ3dqaa	May be because he had feelings for you long before you realize, may be he always wanted to be with you.     But this should not be the case very often. If this happens, then you are you too attractive and irresistible, but then you will know this why guys fall for you often.|`|0ba4c9ff30dbd5fcca6962160c91d3c2aa	I can honestly say that this has never happened to me, so I guess all I can say is that men and women can be friends, as I am living proof.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Good grief woman, of course a gentleman can have as many lady 'friends' as he wants.

I get along better with girls and I would love to have them as JUST friends.  No I'm not gay and I am married (to a woman) and I would love to have a female as a friend.

tK7XacH7aa	How about you just talk to her about how her relationship is. Bring it up nicely and just say "are you sure you want to go through with this even though the relationship has been going so badly? Don't you remember what he did to you, why you had to change schools because things got so bad?" "All he is doing is just coming back to you saying he loves you, but the way he treats you doesn't show that he loves you at all." Tell her that there are other guys out there that are better for her and she should be patient and wait for the guy that is right for her, this guy apparently ain't him. Tell her that there are too many risks if she does get back with him and that she should play it safe and just look for someone else.    Hope this helps.|`|uKYPmVG0aa	oh well he can't make her feel happy and hurt at the same time dump him.. or it will get worse.

KCau26nyaa	Well, if you are in love with him and you want to continue loving him then I suggest you must let him know provided you are very close to him. If you are not close to him then try getting closer to him & then tell him. But if you want to get rid of it then keep yourself busy as much as you can. Put your concentration somewhere else. Don't avoid him because you will miss him, believe that there is a relationship called friendship which exists between a male and female.   If you see him getting close to you then more than anyone else you know better whether to go for a relationship or not? Its you who has to make the choice. I haven't met him. If he is good enough, trustworthy, responsible then I say go for it. Fall in love .....|`|5gDbscPKaa	contact and get in touch with him? unless you are having a lq?
MzqZGvalaa	You're an adult now and you don't need your Mothers permission my darling.  If you want to sleep at your boyfriends then sleep there.  Another thing about being an adult is realising what your parents need to know about your life and what they don't.  One thing they don't need to know about is your sex life.  Now that you're an adult it's really nobody's business but your own where you sleep.  Use the 'what they don't know can't hurt them' strategy.  She has to let go sometime.  You're a bit old to spank or ground, so what's she going to do.  Really, it's going to happen sometime, and the fact that you've left it this long should be a relief to her.  Mention that she brought you up, so she should know that you're responsible and that she instilled a sense of responsibility on you.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Haha i have the opposite problem. i'm 21 he's 27 and HIS mom gets all angry (she's super religious). Basically you should just tell your mom that you are an adult now and that you can make your own decisions. If you can afford it just move out yourself. Maybe your bf will let you move in? My mom was kind of weird (i was around that age) so i moved out with my bf and it all changed :)|`|dWwIEqEwaa	your an adult now, just go and do whatever you want! what can she do about it? nothing. live your life!|`|rV9eqW0yaa	Well, I think being a parent myself, your mom only wants what she thinks is best for you. You may be at a point in your life where it doesn't matter to you that you're having sex before marriage, but you might feel differently later on. I know bc I had a couple partners b4 I met my husband and regret having been with anyone else. Mainly, looking back, I realized that those relationships were not based on deep love - in fact, we were just 'using' each other for selfish means. Just make sure that the relationship you're in is really what you want - otherwise you might regret it.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Move out of HER house, support yourself. and then you don't have to live under her rules.|`|zokJMPBAaa	you of age ,move out and tell your mother of your decision,tell her that you will keep in touch and the way you feel about him,and one thing moms love to hear is that i love you,and i will take care of myself|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	get your own apartment. just for show of course.|`|O18gc2jAaa	your a adult  stand up and do what u want|`|paJRaLOTaa	do what i did...sit her down and talk to her about how u feel about it that you are 20 years old...u know what could happen...and if she doesnt let u be an adult and stay there sometimes you will just move into his apt. and there is nothing she can do about it...trust me when she thinks about it for awhile...losing her little girl she will back off..just dont take advntage of it.|`|2xkbOv23aa	you are 20 move out and get your own place then she really can't say much. as long as you live in HER house she is gonna have a lot more to say about it than if you were on your own.|`|AA11156037	My suggestions, you are NOT going to like.    STAY HOME, dump boyfriend, listen to mom.    You want to test your relationship with your boyfriend, tell one of your common friends that you missed your period.  You will find out what kind of individual for whom you are going to screw over your mom.     The big deal is that you are her child and she wants you to have options.  Options that exclude pregnancy (condoms break), being beaten by a manipulative and abusing spouse/ BF, debilitating illness (condoms break) and generally fervently desiring that you can live your life in the moral manner that she probably tried to instill in your VERY young and vulnerable person.    What are you doing with a 26 YO boyfriend in college?     You don't like sneaking around. Is that because you know what you are DOING is VERY WRONG?    I'll explain to you in a daddy's view (if you were my kid):  1.) You live in my house or I am supporting your very existence and paying for your schooling, car, housing, food, phone or providing you funds.  We have an agreement on behavior and you are VIOLATING our agreement. I can cut off money for school at any point for NON-Conformance.   2.) I sacrificed a vastly different lifestyle and possibly ability to excel (at risk) in order to ensure your life and well-being.  YOU OWE ME to live your life in a moral manner and not to screw up your life based upon you wanting to get laid.   Get a vibrator and a Playgirl!  3.) Who is this PUNK?  He wants to see (*uc*) you but can't go to mom and ASK her to give you both a chance?  Ball-less swine.  4.)  Do you know that even if you wear protection, you have a higher rate of disease than if you were abstaining from sexual behavior? I am thinking meningitis and mononucleosis, for starters.  BTW, do you know what BF has been doing (sexually) since he was 13 or so?    If you don't understand where your mom is coming from or what the gist of what I am trying to shock you into understanding, you are hormonally poisoned!    Funny thing, my now-23 YO daughter told her (now ex-) BF No overnights because its not right. He went off on how 'provincially' that she was raised and that in today's world sex is no big thing. She told me that her response was, "Gee, that was the same attitude about sex and relationships that my mom had when she dropped me off with my dad and went off to husbands 2,3,4 & 5. I didn't see my mom for 4 yrs!  Goodbye!"      My daughter is smarter than to let her hormones rule her.  It can be painful at times but then she could have 3+ rug rats at her age, married to or shacked up with the town abuser, broke and on welfare.   OH NO, WAIT!  That would be three of her female cousins who had either not heeded mom/ dad's advise or scoffed at their country (moral) attitudes. Two dropped out of college because they got knocked up and one had an AIDs scare to boot (while pregnant).     Honey, I REALLY wish you well and hope that you make the right decision!

HjhA6CJhaa	Kneeling down is romantic, but it depends on the girl, you know?    I mean, I personally love the unique ways people propose. Like, more than just getting down on one knee and saying "will you marry me?"    But then, after the message is gotten across... It's sweet and romantic to kneel. Probably advisable.    I wouldn't be offended if I was proposed to without the kneeling, I'd probably never think of it again, but if given the choice, it would be nice.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	oh you gotta kneel.  and don't do it in public or in front of family.  you don't know what she's gonna say, if she needs to think about it or the answer's no, it will be totally awkward if you do it in front of people.|`|jNwkgcTCaa	Kneeling down seems more romantic.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Go to a favourite park with a picnic basket get out a bottle of wine for you and the lady, and kneel down take her hand etc, (when she's least expecting it) or to her or yours favourite restaurant and propose there if you don't want to neel down (go into the restaurant or a cafe.. it is still romantic that way).|`|fOYp0gGqaa	My Sweetie proposed standing up, with an entire paragraph of why he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.

vn2Lq7hIaa	I'm sure you'll get lots of different views and varied reasons from guys   that have and have not dated women with children.     I am a single guy that has no interest in marriage at this point in my life, and I've made this point to my girlfriends long before we even dated, and I would let someone new know that too.    I do have long term friendships with females, married and single,  which I respect and cherish. They are all wonderful, caring individuals.    When it comes to dating, there is good fun to be had with all of them.  The only disappointment is ( and that's minor ) the chic's with   children usually are not able to have a sleepover. But I have never been disappointed, just have to fit things in wherever possible.      I agree with you that single Mothers are considered less desirable dates. That is unfortunate, because they have matured beyond  their years, and make wonderful communicators. For a man that is ready to settle down, is marriage minded and seeking a mature women I would have no hesitation in recommending a single Mother.    To answer your question: Why do men avoid single Mothers?    I would not avoid single Mothers, I wouldn't care,   and it wouldn't bother me in the least. The only time  I draw the line in dates is with married women.    May all your dates be better than expected  Please remember to practice safe sex.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|EgNgEVaRaa	There's a stronger sense of commitment when you date someone who has kids.|`|9f751efea5e097481fd7c6bf7d4af274aa	Because then they arent the center of attention anymore. :P|`|BbRewQjQaa	Men avoid them because kids mean problems from babysitters to babies daddy issues and no privacy.

Divorced. Marriage just didn't work out. My kids are not brats and are very well behaved. Ages 12 and 2. I don't bring different guys around my kids. In fact a guy does not even come to my house unless I see potential long term. So with that said-- that is why a guy wouldn't date a "chick with kids." Because her time does not evolve around him, he's paranoid about the guy (baby daddy) she was with before him-whether they still screw around or whatever, and too much responsibility involved. So I can't blame a guy that is not used to any of these issues for not wanting to be bothered. There is nothing wrong with that. To each his/her own! But the fact still remains that as more and more marriages end in divorce and more and more guys don't stick around after getting a girl pregnant, the chances are in favor that you guys will end up with a woman with at least 1 kid. P.S. I have never had a hard time getting a boyfriend kids or none. Also let me mention that Jesus had a step-father...remember Joseph! You may say that's different it was God's baby, but no Joseph still had to look at and take care of this little boy that was not his or maybe didn't even look like him.

24hP4ottaa	Be careful of what you ask for.      First ask a lawyer, then ask a child-support worker, if the advice was favorable, then ask a income tax Rep.    At one point, I had social services and my  husband [now ex.] and I weren't living together for some time.

The only thing is, I am worried hes gonna see it as a problem later on, and not want to be with me because of it.    These types of relationships can work. so long as both people don't see the age difference as an issue. because if they do, then it will make them both uncomfortable in the situation so matter how much they like each other.    and its not wrong. don't worry. :)

8bplNvAQaa	They probably think you're trying to hard to fit in, or don;t like an arrogant air about you.  Whatever it is they are very dense for not trying to get to know the REAL you.       If this has some truth, remember they are hating on you and that's that.  You're fine how you are, but don't care about them and don't try to please them.  It's hard when you need acceptance, but these people won't give you it so just be who you are and stop saying things you think they'll like to hear, or things that make you sound good.      You'll be fine.  Don't let them get to you or they win.  They are sad people if they say these things to you.  Its horrible, uncalled for and done because they are being nasty.  Remember that anyone that dense and ignorant can never be better than someone who cares and has empathy.  :)    They're probably jealous of you anyway or idiot and insecure pack animals that need a common person to insult.  Groups tend to do this when they are insecure of everyone - they tend to find a common enemy for the butt of their jokes.|`|hKy1blrqaa	Smile. Be nice and dont say anything bad back to them.

Stay with your friends. When people say things like that they are either jealous or just want to mess around. Just be yourself and if people can't accept that, then there is something wrong with them.

YEZVTDJmaa	I would ask her out to the movies. If you two seem to like eachother then there is no harm. Even if you come to find you don't like her as any more than a friend, then you two can still remain friends. But I would take her out to the movies, maybe invite more people so it doesn't seem too forward and it could be a group thing. You only live once and what is there to lose? You've only been there 3 weeks, if she doesn't turn out to be the right one, i'm sure you'll find someone else.|`|E8QzbqWPaa	One of my friends recently moved here and was in your exact same situation.

Good luck.|`|OG3lycSPaa	If you're not doing well in school maybe it's time to make some changes. If you see it in a positive way you can improve yourself. Instead of cussing at the teacher about your performance in the past; you can now focus on your future and bring up goals you want to achieve in the next semester/quarter. Think about what you want. How you want to do in school, how you want your teacher to think of you and how you want to feel about yourself. Focus on the positive things in your life, find and reach out to positive people, and you can achieve anything you want.|`|JsnChofsaa	thinking about swearing to teacher and parent already made a bad person, and maybe your teacher have a good reason
tpbt1bPKaa	weird|`|NQ3puIrraa	omg that is creepy i would be offended that is so mean that is how fights happen and alot of people cant stand poeple i hope this helped|`|HHkda22Laa	I'm not gay or even bisexual but I have been stalked by a guy. I know being stalked by a guy is creepy. I had a former male coworker at my last job call me up on my old cellphone everyday for three weeks straight until I left him a voice   message telling him to stop or else I would call the police on him. Luckily, he stopped. If a girl kept calling me or asked about me to a coworker, then I would be happy. If a guy  kept calling me like my  former male coworker, I would be extremely annoyed and scared. If he went by your work to see if you were there, that would have been acceptable. You should not be flattered by how this guy has acted towards you. You said this guy is 29? I don't know if you are younger than him but he should have common sense and be mature enough not to resort to being so shy with you in person.  If I were you, I'd be frightened that he's called your work by blocking out his number and asking for your whereabouts. Just be cautious about this guy. Don't always be alone (be with a coworker) when you're  heading out of work. Make sure you always have your cellphone turned on. You should be happy about this guy if he didn't call your work and has complimented you at times along with having a normal conversation with you (you said he does not say much at all if not anything at all).  I hope that this helps and take care of yourself.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Ask him if he was the one who called. He should have mentioned it at some point. Make sure it was the crush who called and not a serial killer. It would worry me that my place of employment would freely give out this information. This sounds like a dangerous situation. Check into it and don't let people give out information like that.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	This is very scary. You should be very careful where this guy is concern. I don't want to freak you out but there is something very weird about this guy. Is there anyway that you can find out more about him? If I was in your shoes I would try to find out as much as I could about whom he is. You should also talk to your parents and friends about this. And just be careful. Try to avoid this guy as much as you can. It could be that he's doing drugs or something but there is something wrong with him.|`|ii0C0tfXaa	That is creepy! also it may not be the guy you like doing it...i would watch out and if you work late have someone walk you to your car...and be very careful!
ccgcJ9PKaa	keep in touch with him CONSTANTLY ok???    HOW YOU KNOW YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS OVER: all couples can talk to each other WITHOUT awkward moments or just moments of unpeaceful silences in wen u keep trying to think of a toic to start. if that starts hapopening between u n ur bf then its over. trust me. its happened.|`|R4MXqBHhaa	4 mounts ago? Wow! you say you love him but mounting 4 other people speaks a lot louder.|`|JnElq85taa	You need to have a talk with him before he leaves.  Make sure you both realize how important it is for you to speak -- at least a few minutes -- every single day.  You have to know what's going on in each other's lives.  You have to remind each other how you feel.    Get a webcam.  Both of you.  Use it nightly.  You'd be surprised how much it helps.  You can show each other things and it really makes you feel more connected to see a person's face.    Text all the time, whenever the mood strikes you.  How old are you?  If you're old enough to be intimate, maybe send some scandalous messages.  Also, send picture messages -- take pictures of things happening in your life.  If you see a beautiful sunset or something funny in a store or ANYTHING interesting, take a picture and send it to him.    Write each other.  Not just e-mail, but also handwritten letters.  You would be surprised how nice it feels to get "snail mail."    Send little care packages to each other.  They don;t have to be filled with expensive things.  Just his favorite candy and a burned CD or something creative to let him know you're thinking about him.      Another fun thing to keep you connected -- it sounds lame, but watch TV together while you're on the phone or webcam.  Watch some horrible reality show and make fun of the people on it together.  Make bets on who will get voted off.  Play an online game together like monopoly (www.pogo.com) or boggle (www.wordsplay.net).  Browse through the funny people on hotornot.com and comment on them.  Watch a movie together.     None of this is as good as actually being together, but it will make you feel more connected to each other.  Good luck.|`|wE2etBzbaa	if you love him so much, you won't be asking that question.    so I would say do his best friend.  some people does that,   or be nice and understand if you can't patient then break up

0AYPgUQIaa	That people often mistake lust for love.  That many lovers think it is all about play. When they face hardships they separate, proving that their love wasn't that strong after all, they just enjoyed the good times but couldn't face the problems.  True love is really rare and very rarely lasts for a lifetime.|`|5JqCObDSaa	>   New American Standard Bible ?      --------------------------------------...  The Excellence of Love  1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.   4 Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, 5 does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, 6 does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.   8 Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part; 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. 11 When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. 13 But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.       Because of Jesus' love, we to can love unconditionally as long as we abide in him and him in us. The above scripture tells us what love is. Because of Jesus in my life, yes I know about real love and am still in love with my husband, we will be married 17yrs. this August. When you learn of the Saviors love, you will love everyone differently and be able to look beyond their faults and see their needs.|`|103242cb0f8f5b0c238704d60d752beaaa	Nothing|`|dpCWHwUVaa	Yes, I am helplessly in love.

IXskJPlVaa	Of course yes - attraction doesn't depend on age - it can happen anytime and anywhere. I would talk rather than wondering. Best of Luck|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Yeah, certainly. But I wouldn't really approach them. First of all, because it's too risky and they may be under age. And secondly, I'm generally too shy.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Yep, but as I've got older, younger girls look more and more young to the point of childhood to me ;)    It really depends on what you term as a "younger girl", if you're younger than 18, what are you doing in there in the first place???|`|KncPJwIaaa	Never i love them cougars|`|1zwxspIAaa	I like milfs.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Yes I date women 12-15 years younger than me.... sometimes more.

For me, they bring back memories of high school or college.  As for taking it any farther, even if I was available, I don't think so.  I assume you're talking more than 10-15 years younger, and that just seems kinda creepy to me.

Okay, My Girlfriend is almost 12 years older than me (I'm turning 23 in March & she will be 35 in May), but the age difference doesn't mean much to us. Besides, I love & adore her with all of my heart & soul & she loves me back the same way too, if not more. Never had I ever thought that she would be the one I'd call my soulmate.    Both of us have been in terrible relationships that didn't last long & really got us into thinking that we couldn't trust anybody or find true love ever again (that's why she was scared at first when I revealed my true feelings for her - now we're even making plans so she can move in with me). She has thought about marriage, but only if she found the right person (after being together in the best relationship ever for about a year & a half now, I can still hardly believe that she wants ME to be that person).    Even though she sometimes doubts herself, because her so-called "best friend" & a few other people here have been gossiping, spreading rumors throughout our workplace (we're Co-Workers too, but I'm not always in the building because I'm in I.T support) they've been badmouthing her, commenting on the stuff she wears, & just insulting her & trying to make her look bad (I've learned that they have had a grudge on her since day one). No matter what, I always prove them wrong (Most people aren't like that though. When we're out together, it's amazing the way people stare & smile or even come up & compliment us). My Girlfriend might not be perfect to the rest of the world, but she IS to me.    I'm still trying to figure out a way to break this to my family, because my Girlfriend & I have told just about everybody else I can think of & it's becoming harder to keep it a secret for much longer. I truly feel content & I have never been happier in my entire life than when I am with her.|`|qW4GVjROaa	I say good luck to you. Go for it|`|icrsY3Kgaa	It can be for some.

5fe1d29bd466e79a18a65a07d90f084faa	Ok inside and out...  Inside: Show more confidence, don't be afraid to talk to the boys, even if it's the super cute unapproachable ones. Don't make lame jokes, but if you know a really good one you can tell them a joke. Also if there's a guy that you like, and he's single...take the bull by the horns. Show him that you're his perfect girl by talking to him, finding out about his interests (for instance if he likes cars, I suggest researching his favorite kind so you can talk about that), and just generally making him feel good in your company.   Outside: If you're a little heavy...don't worry about it. Wear figure flattering clothing. Avoid wearing super tight clothing, but don't wear things like hoodies and such. Hoodies and jeans are basically a way of saying (I don't want to be seen or noticed). Try wearing nice clothing...skirts, heels, nice jeans (with embroidery for instance) and such. Makeup is good, but have your limits. Don't pile it on, and use it to make your good features stand out rather than cover it up. For instance go online, and look up makeup tips for how to best match eyeshadow to your eye color, apply liner to make your eyes look bigger and such. Take good care of your skin...pimples say that you are an easily nervous person, stress out a lot, and they take away from your confidence. Check things like your hair and eyebrows...(noone likes bushman eyebrows, but don't pluck them into the oblivion), and don't overcolor your hair (that is murder to your hair).    Last but definetely not least...do small things to get yourself noticed. Have good posture when you walk and don't slouch (Walking with your head down is another way of saying "Please don't look at me"), and speak up in class and voice your opinion even if it disagrees with the teacher.     Best of luck! :-)|`|SyuQ1aO5aa	You cant always make a person like you, just be yourself and sooner or later maybe he'll like you.  Good luck !|`|SVeLk0lYaa	Don't try and keep looking around. Wait for the perfect one to walk by...    honestly, if you wanna be more attractive to a TEEN guy, you gotta wear some slu*ty stuff and show a little of kate and katie (if u get my drift).|`|HbayB338aa	do what I do it always works stare at the guy make it look like u really like him then he will be thinking about u remember it always works|`|Z0VvcKCraa	I think any guy will appreciate a funny and outgoing girl.  Everyone seeks a connection in their partner and the connect differs on who the person is.  In general, you should always be an open minded person and always up for having all types of friends.  As for the out part, if you aren't comfortable with how you look now, try some different hair styles, wear a little makeup and maybe switch up your wardrobe.  Although looks should not be the reason why a guy is attracted to you, at least not on looks solely.  Always remember a little goes a long way.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	being hot|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Be yourself and don;t run with the herd|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Being yourself, and being generally happy.

Just be kind of a **** until you end up dating a guy you really like.    Be feminine.  That's the main thing, to me.  Dress in ways that show off your curves, because curvy = feminine.  Dress and act feminine, that will attract the attention of males.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Be yourself. And don't be a ****. I know they want that..But they will just use you. So don' t be a ****.

Don't be too quick to judge them, but don't put up with guys who are just playing games.  I am not sure how old you are but you are attractive enough that you should get plenty of attention.  Don't be afraid to go for after a guy if you are really interested, you will have good odds on gaining his affection.|`|D0ShtJJJaa	some guys are players|`|3PlT64Yuaa	You're beautiful!    Alot of guys don't appreciate what they have until they lose it. Don't feel pressured to settle for a guy that doesn't appreciate you from the start.

First off, that age gap is just WAY too huge.     Second, 65 is WAY too old to start having kids.    Third, and this is from a friend who actually has EXPERIENCE in this area (he was briefly married to a Filipino girl) -if you're 65 and got a 23 year old Filipino girl interested in you, she wants money, a green card, or both. It ain't love, buddy. Find someone else.|`|3WeAfZNraa	You might want to think about the future.

Are you prepared to leave a young woman all alone to raise a kid b/c you die? Is that fair to her or your baby? Damn, you'll be in your 80's when he/she graduates high school. What do you think the chances are that you'll see your kid finish college?    You two are at different stages in life, don't think you should really be together. I mean do you ever stop to think you're more then old enough to be her father? Shoot I'm 25, my grandpa is 80 and my father is 53.    I don't know why you're asking this, not like you're really gonna listen to us, you'll just do what you want.|`|WBVw1SK0aa	Don't even worry about it.

Don't let an age difference get in the way because if  you do, you might spend the rest of your life wondering how your life would be with her in it!
RC8Pxx8eaa	Loving someone and being "in love" is different, when it is impossible to say why you feel the way you do, when there are no words to describe your feelings and emotions for him, when there are no descriptives you can find that will adequately portray who he is to you.   When you love him with a love that is beyond love and you know your heart and soul are safe with him.  When he is you and you are him and when being committed is not something that you think about as once your heart has found its home, you are home.  This for me is being "in love". Each time I see my fiance I feel the excitement that I felt on our first date, the first time we kissed, the first time we made love. I never get tired of seeing him, I miss him even when he is with me as I know he will be going back and I am never truly at peace with myself until he is with me.  I have known him since Nov 06, we got engaged April 08 and are getting married in June. He is my soul mate - dont settle for less than this.|`|NmIYrL1Paa	there is a weird feeling and you always want to see him/her.|`|wE2etBzbaa	If I don't know, who knows then?  simply I use my BRAIN|`|UYmRjCY9aa	when you look forward to their call, visit, when what they say accords with you, when you have never ever felt like it before.

Love is mostly a decision and many people just said these things.  You won't look at other people romantically anymore. You will be consumed with your lover and their issues and life. You will feel like you and they are the only two people who matter.  You will decide that there is no reason or issue or obstacle that you can't overcome or overlook for them.  You will never say "or else!" because there is no other place except together.    You will decide everyday without effort that the person is right for you and you will show them love without conditions.      Kinda like how you can fight with your parents (or others you love) and know somewhere inside you, that you will never ever not have them in your life.  You will always love them.|`|9dNPN9CSaa	I'm sure that this reveals all:-    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    C U @ 3.10 then?

If you got someone who you love seeing, makes you laugh, makes your stomach tight everytime you first see him, and if you have feelings that are so deep that you already picture your lives together.    The major thing is when you don't even have to ask yourself, or other people that question. You will just know.|`|ugQPb744aa	You won't have to ask, you just know, it is a completely overwhelming feeling.

VSVQHKwKaa	You haven't learned to handle stress in a mature way. Mature people internalize their stress and deal with each other civilly.    You, on the other hand, externalize it and make everyone feel crummy.    So, I want you to look up how to dispel anger. Google it.     Maybe you'll count to ten. Maybe you'll think of Christmas. But whatever you need to do, you have to get on top of your bad emotions.    Otherwise, they'll dictate your actions for the rest of your life.    Good Luck!|`|a2tptFbqaa	Your not alone... we all get annoyed at people.  It's easier to take out your angst on those people who are more likey to forgive you for being that way (family/friends). Before you answer, take a deep breath.. believe it or not, that moment can make the difference. If you do snap, be brave enough to apologize especially if your in the wrong.

Cpp1LddVaa	A few quick thoughts:    (1) Every guy is different.  (2) Start by kissing him on the side of  his, check  his  comfort zone and go from there.  (3) Be very patient and forgiving if inexperience makes him a little clumsy.  (4) Be tolerant if he wants to press against your mouth and kiss you "hard" rather than choosing the soft, gooey route.  (5) Don't shame him with a lot of unnecessary instructions.  (6) Practice, practice, practice    Good luck and best wishes|`|aEonduUUaa	french kiss xD|`|oEUjPGsUaa	dont think about what they like,  think about what you like ;] =]|`|wE2etBzbaa	They can't believe they did, they don't have any idea, only it is a KISS.|`|2ijHmVeSaa	it depends on the guy..  and the situation.  my favorite is aggressive  but that's when i am in a sexual mood|`|gKa5rdNYaa	We are all different!

Help your friend loose weight, but be his friend for the person within not out.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Tell him no, simple as that. You don't have to give him a reason.    However, if he's your best friend, once things cool off, you could get him to be more active WITH you. Invite him on outings to go hiking, skiing, skating, or walks, whatever. As long as there's not a medical condition that keeps him large (Like diabeties), perhaps this will help his size and give you two more time to get to know each other, and you could actually appreciate him for who he is and not care about his body.|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	Watch the Nutty Professor (Eddie Murphy version) and call me in the morning.|`|AA10381723	it should not mater of he is obese or not you said that he is sweet and romantic you should give it a try and if it don't work out you still be friends|`|d9XXe2kLaa	As a fellow fatty who has actually had this happen to him too, I would suggest just explaining that whilst you love him as a best friend, you are not into him in a romantic way.

Well, I think you're looking up to him as a bestfriend or brother that's why you don't want to lose him. There are sooooo many fishes in the ocean. You are not the only girl in the world. It's not alright to be hideous about your feelings to your friend. Tell him that "Let's just 'cherish' our friendship" or just go straight to the point that you just want to be friends with him 'forever'.    or the other way around    Maybe you like him but because he's obese. . .    *sad music*    you don't want to be seen with a bf whose fat.    Well, the decision is yours, girl! Good luck!|`|a2tptFbqaa	You answered your own question.... He's your best friend and you don't want to lose him. Let him know that.. Tell him that you don't want a romantic involvement with him because of that... then start inviting him out for walks... He is probably suffering from a low self-esteme and feels comfortable enough to ask you out. Help him by being there and perhaps, getting him moving. as far as your first time goes... wait and be very selective... hot sexy guys don't always know what they're doing.. sometimes tend to be self absorbed and don't really care about you experience...Your first time should be very special.
52otNiElaa	she doesnt sound too fab for yur type i think.
AA11618874	It shouldn't matter what the stars say. they're just stars. Do you mean to tell me you actually believe that because some Greeks hundreds of years ago believed that they could play "connect the dots" with the stars and so that meant the stars have the power to govern who I am "supposed" to be with?  BULL SH**!!!  I mean no offense to you personally, however, you said that you woke up one morning feeling silly, and I think you should feel silly for believing that a bunch of burning balls of gas determine your romantic destiny. I say I was born in September and if I fall in love with a woman who was born in February, dammit I will.  I believe in God and not in greek astrological mumbo jumbo. Again I hope I haven't offended you but if you like the boy ask him out. And if he likes you then great! If you and him fall in love then that's a beautiful thing. If the stars fell out of the sky do you think humanity would cease to know true love or stop being able to find it? really now!

adQWVOeAaa	I once took a girl bowling.  quite possibly the worst date of my life. Unless you know for sure she would like that, I would avoid it. I happened to take the most uncoordinated girl ever bowling and she had a miserable time.    I would just recommend somewhere you can talk.    If you know of a nice romantic place with a brilliant star filled sky away from city lights... that would be my recommendation. Or just a nice walk through a park or something.    Girls seem to be suckers for stuff that isn't cliche.
54VqkaRaaa	Hey Tron.  First dates are always tough.  But actually, the most important thing on a first date is just trying to have fun and getting to know the other person.  Deciding whether you should go for the kiss is always a dilemma for the guy.  Unless the girl makes the move...which doesn't usually happen.  There's a lot that goes through your head...like whether or not she's ready for a kiss...what if the kiss doesn't go well...what if she pulls away....or of course what if you're not feeling comfortable about kissing her...or as you said you don't have the innate desire to kiss her.  I think all this is normal.  When it comes to a first date, I don't think that whether or not you kiss will make or break things.  Sometimes just a sweet peck on the cheek and a warm hug are plenty.  Even if she was expecting the kiss...as long as the date went well, chances are good that she'll be eager to go on a second date.  She may like the fact that you didn't try to kiss her on the first date.  It shows that you're not just looking to jump into bed.  Plus it gives both of you something to look forward to.  As long as there was good chemistry and both of you were having fun, there's a a good chance you'll get a second date with this girl.  And if she doesn't wanna go out again just because you didn't kiss her...she's not worth your time.  Hope this helps!
TKHA5okpaa	Loke. Just kidding.  I think it's when you have love and care for someone but are not IN LOVE with them.  If your trying to say it to someone just say " I loke you", or "I'm in like with you"  They'll get what you mean.|`|7sMOh0V6aa	call em up. tellem you have herpes or sumthin that might make him leave.

neJbYkJoaa	It's possible that when you tell him you have work to do, he won't accept it and then you feel that you have to say OK, when you know you won't be able to keep that commitment.      Talk to him and tell him how you feel and that you are really sorry and it was wrong to commit when you couldn't.  Also, make sure next time if that ever happens, to call him and let him know that you can't make it instead of just not showing.  Try to put yourself in his shoes and realize how you would like him to treat you.      Ask him how to make it right with him and start over.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	do something extra special for him invite him over and make him a special dinner give him a good massage ect. show him how sorry you are that you didnt fit in time for him.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Be honest with him.

He doesn't understand that you have a life of your own and that you have responsibilities that don't involve him. If he can't stand not seeing you twice, then you need to find someone who appreciates you enough to let you do what you need to do. I could guess that if the situation was reversed and he was the one who was busy, you would love him enough to let him finish his work.    I had the same problem with my ex. She just couldn't see that I had work to get done. Needless to say, she's now my ex.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	An important part of a relationship is trust.    You should not make a promise you cannot keep.

wqtwzzPeaa	First, make sure this is the right time in your relationship to tell her this. Second, make sure you mean it. If you know you're ready just get some time alone with her and tell her. Face to face, don't do it in an email or something, it'll just be awkward.|`|ddIEKGRfaa	Quick, like a bandaid. :-) Just say it man. "I think I love you."    Edit: these other have a good point.

Right before / after a kiss or hug tell her.    4. Just come out and tell her.    It all depends on which kind of girl she is and what she likes.

smEPI9G2aa	Call the family law division of the court in Orange County and ask if they have a refferal list.  I live in northern California in Yolo County and the court keeps a list of attorneys that specialize in different types of law.  It is worth the time and consultation fee if its not free, to talk with an attorney and expalin the situation.  Keep in mind that 99% of attorneys will want a retainer up front to take your case.  What this means is that they will come up with a fee, usually a few thousand dollars to take your case.  This fee is billed against for phone calls, court appearances, etc when you become their client.  I also work as a Legal Assistant and am going to school to get my Legal Assistant degree.  Family law is a very complicated field, and you are best off to get some expert advice.  Good luck to you.|`|X5Qzk78maa	i live in newport beach and i had some legal issues and went to the santa ana courthouse for any questions i had, u will have to get the information at a courthouse or get a lawayer first, either way a lawyer will be necessary, my uncle got custody of his daughter because her mother was abusing drugs and alcohol. u have to be able to prove her instability otherwise she will definitly keep her since moms usually are granted custody, sorry, gl
f3SyOyMEaa	If you did something that made all of them mad at you then you should apologize and tell them how you feel. Make amends. If you didn't do anything and they are just turning on you, then they aren't your true friends.   If you can't fix it with your friends, sit with who you want to sit with and don't worry about what anybody says or asks why you're sitting with them. Tell them the story. It will work out.|`|aEonduUUaa	just talk to ppl its not that hard =)|`|ckiqO9V0aa	The only real answer would be to make up with your real friends. Go to them in humility and just tell them that your sorry for whatever you did, even if you think they were the ones in the wrong.|`|smEPI9G2aa	Hang out with your new group of people and ignore the ones who give you the odd looks questioning why your hanging out with them.  If the other 3 people you are in a disagreement with are your true friends, this disagreement will blow over and you will be friends again.  If it does not, you have made some new friends and you can never have enough of them.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Hang out with the new group anyway and say, 'It's not sudden, I realize I don't spend much time so here I am'  Or just hang with them until the other group stops being mad at you. But learn a lesson from it if being with people is important to you, don't ignore the 'new' group when the old one comes around. You might need them again. BTW they wouldn't have made that comment if they didn't like you and at some point been made to feel unimportant or insignificant by you. Be a bit more careful in the future with others feelings. Good luck with this.|`|AA11446818	it seems like you want your friends back because you have no one to hang out with at lunch ?! do you want a lunch buddy, or the friendship of your friends back ?
2XTkSV4daa	People like that can be very annoying, I know! They will only talk to you when there's no one else around. That is definitely not a true friend, but since she does tell you secrets, maybe there could be something there. Next time she calls, answer and let her talk for a while and then ask her why she doesn't talk to you at school. It should go well from there. God bless!|`|MRwb4jQYaa	She is completely using you.  Sorry to say, but it's the truth.  Someone who isn't willing to be seen as your friend in public, is truly no friend to you.  You're better than that and should never put up with that kind of treatment.  If she wants to confide in you and tell you her darkest secrets, then she should be considerate enough of your feelings to not ignore you.    Dump her.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	not a true friend - you've got the right idea - stop answering the phone when she calls - permanently.|`|g1Zu5UTRaa	she prob is but maybe her friends would think diff of her if she hung out with you  i dont no thats only if ur like a loser which ur prob not|`|JB93S2PXaa	i dun think she is a true fren. she may see u as a fren, since she can confide in u. However she deosnt hv the guts to akowledge u in school, which i feel u should not withstand.     she gives me the feeling that she doesnt wan anyone to know that u two are on frenly terms. i thk recognition of a frenship is rather important|`|szVvf7Nkaa	No, she is not a true friend.  You should ignore her completely. And if she approaches you to find out what is wrong with you then tell her the truth. It will be easier to end the friendship if you tell her what you just told us.
75SSAFsPaa	Ok do not be mad at your mom cause she was only trying to help and stop crying about you friend situation to her you know she loves you and wants to fix everything BUT IF YOU KEEP UP THIS YOU WILL BE A TOTAL MOMMAS GIRL and other kids will see that so do not blame her she is just doing what moms do best( PROTECT)as far as a Enemy in your class well that is GREAT!! why on earth would you want to avoid her?enemies build character and friendships You either will become friends with everyone who cannot stand her either or you will find something in her that is friend worthy.wow you really have a problem with seeing the glass half empty rather than seeing it half full(ASK YOU MOM WHAT THAT MEANS) My enemy was Susan she had all the connections and guys would flock to her cause she had a cute figure and I spent 4 good years of my life planning how to get her back example there was a halloween party and she was going as a sexy belly dancer and she knew I was chubby and could never pull that off so she asked me what I was going as and I said "I want it to be a surprise,but every guy will want to dance with me !"and when I walked in they all did they wanted pictures of me with them and suzy was ummm well no one noticed her.I CAME AS A ELEPHANT and I was so cute I won not only first prize but also the guy who suzy had her eye on.SO enemies are a necessary part of a interesting teenage life ! so find your Suzy and tear a new hole in her!!

So it ended in him concluding that I should definitely avoid bras at all costs.     Anywho, you have a chance but I wouldn't necessarily take his super smooth dare me approach unless her breasts are on the small side.

That'll open up the idea that you're willing to see if she's willing to show :)    Strip poker :)  Strip Pool (if you have a pool table) MY husband's fav game :)  Strip anything! (table tennis, computer game, video game)    I suggest not telling her anything, losing the first point, race, hand, whatever! Then you take off your shirt, and start the next round. When she asks why'd you take off your shirt? Say.. "Oh I thought I was suppose to lose my shirt/ I thought this was strip poker, whatever" See how she reacts to it. Then maybe throw in, "If you keep this up, I'll be outta my pants in no time!"  Just play it by ear, she might play along, she might not. If she kids around and says "nope, you can keep your shirt", then don't push it. You don't want her to be uncomfortable around you. You can always turn it into a semi regular joke with you two, and eventually she might change her mind after she's given it some thought and surprise you.    good luck!|`|UWZIEFqzaa	sicko|`|W2Qegyrqaa	i've been reading your questions. dude you're a perv

Also, there is a counseling / workshop course called IMAGO therapy that is great for bringing couples back to a more meaningful relationship.  I have taken that course and only have good things to say about it.  It was started by Hendrix, who wrote the book, The Road Less Traveled.

2mqrbxN1aa	In my honest true opinion. I would tell you to cut ties with her before you fall in love. It seems it could get that way.

All the best..|`|kxelduWmaa	If your absolutely sure that she does not like you "more than a friend" then unfortunately it's almost impossible to get out of the "friend zone". The best way would be to spend some time apart for awhile and then come back with more sexual intentions. Most girls don't want to risk loosing a good friend so they won't allow things to escalate. The ones that do, will allow it because they actually do like you more than a friend and want things to escalate.You could always start talking to another girl and see how she reacts to it. Sometimes a little jealousy is needed for a womans true feelings to come out. If you know deep down that you are the best decision she could make and that she's the one for you then sometimes these drastic measures are needed. But first and formost you should always talk to her and tell her how you feel about her first and that you want to be together. Communication is always best, but remember never supplicate. Good luck

It is what you make of it.  My fiancee is 24 and I am 54.  Both of our families are happy for us.|`|c5cd0335ee42a5ea6e90bf0c236232e4aa	yes and no, depends how one handles the issue, is he looking for sex with and older women or is he really in love with you, think about it, he is not mentally mature yet and will only be years from now and will he be still in love with you cause he will be exploring from now until he is atleast 28+ cause most men mature later than women and when they are young they wanna explore and feel they are it, for him its perhaps a big/huge wow, his doing it with an older women. does he work or still studing or a drop out, do you work or study and then look at it from an outsider and see if he can be a provider is you were to become a mother tomorrow, can he be man and give you all that you and the kids would require, then if the answer is yes, well done then yes it can work, but as long as 10years from now when your are 34 and him 29 will he be looking at the younger ladies, in most cases without being sexest and trust i'am not, older men tend to lokk for younger women. trust me i;am not saying that older women cannot have younger guys yes they can but they cannot expect a meanigful relationship and a long lastimg one with a younger man because he will at sometime start looking for younger women because he cannot be seen with an older women especially when he is around his pals/friends etc. so think hard about it and be honest with yourself because although everyone can say what they want you will have to make your own mind up and decide wether he is the right one for you not just now but long term. sometimes we are so desperate for love that we are blinded by some good fling....good luck and enjoy|`|rkZhVpvgaa	Age difference does not matter.  If you truly love each other, go ahead|`|y6wo6dRMaa	Yes you should give more time.  At his age, the priorities should be to study and make a successful career.  He needs to focus.  You can support his endevours without getting into any long term relationships. Things change over time.  What is good now is not so good later and vice-a-verse.|`|81J81DGqaa	I'm almost the same age as him. And damn, if I had a girl like you(age), I would be damn lucky. I'm just tired of girls my generation. They're all childish. CAN'T TAKE THEM.    Anyway...DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS. You're a grown woman and you know what are you doing. You love the guy and he loves you.     In my opinion, your age doesn't matter. If you had like 40 years, it would. :)|`|it7C6nFSaa	age dont matter its nuthin but a number  if ur family cant accept then fu*ck em!|`|ME7540ZBaa	age doesnt matter sweety..  5years gap isnt too much compared to others..  but actually you're both young.many more to come and go.

So according to me you both must stay as good friends....only friends...|`|Q8Z35cF4aa	Age only matters if you let it matter.  The conception of the older one having to teach the younger one is not really true thou. Of corse one will have more life experience than the other, but I'm pretty sure that, in the end, you'll end up learning things from him as well.   If you like him and if he makes your life brighter, then just stay with him regardless of what you family think. You're the one dating him not them. You're the one that has to like him.   Just take things slow and see where the relationship takes you. And don't act on what others thing. Act on what you feel for him.|`|Ea6TnOuOaa	Age has nothing do as far as two are on the same wavelength in terms of thinking and calibre.  The clash between the two stems from the misunderstanding galore.  There goes a saying "Birds of a feather flock together" likewise if two like-minded people get on very well irrespective of their class and creed.  Age is the last thing that matters to a relationship. So if your thinking wavelength is matching, you do not worry about any other factor.  As for making him understand the situation, it is a question of maturity that one gains with passing age.  So he will pick up as he grows.|`|AA10478236	The younger you are, the more age matters...       I need to ask, how big of an age difference is there between your parrents?  I doubt that they are only a few months apart in age...    My parents have about 12 years between them, Me and my Fiance are about 4 years apart...    The older you get the less the age difference will matter...    Good luck!|`|SC9mWBO1aa	no dont give up age really is just a number. unless the younger person your with acts and is immature then theres no point in staying in a relationship if your the only one who acts like an adult. Although its ok to have fun and play around like a child sometimes, but not all the time. anyways my aunt was 33 when she started dating a 19 year old and my family discouraged her a little but in the end we just wanted her to be happy, and they got happily married! go with your heart and do whats best for you and what makes you happy|`|TpfJdQ2Oaa	24 is a good age to take your own decisions. If the guy makes you happy, then go for it. But since he is 19 (which is my age), you've also got to think about the age gap. At a certain point, age will matter, because what might happen is that when he's 25, you're 30; women's bodies change over a period of time. At 30, you might have a little less strength than before and at 40, it'll decrease even more. What I'm trying to say is that basically when you're battling with your own problems, he might not be there to support you. It's also a known fact that men mature later than women, for example, if I am 19, I should probably pick a guy who's about 21 to get married to, because his thinking will be on the same level as mine. Women mature faster, maybe because our body changes when we hit puberty and everything, but women are more calmer and tend to handle situations differently compared to men. Today he understands you and cares for you, let's just say that the future is unseen and unpredictable. If things go wrong, then you're honestly gonna become bitter. That's the reason your parents are not accepting it. You should listen to your parents, after all it was their choice to bring you into this world, and without them, your existence would be void. Don't misunderstand what your parents are saying, or think that they're against you, you should give a thought to their concerns too. If you were in their place, you'd do the same, maybe you'll say no right now, but it will happen. When we are individuals, we think of ourselves, but when we're with a spouse, we think of what he/she will be happy with, when we become parents, we think of giving our kids everything they ask for and making good people out of them, that's why we shield them and protect them from anything that we might think is harmful to them. After all your happiness matters to your folks, but think about their happiness too. They did that for you when you were young, thought of your good and happiness, it's time you do the same.   Since he's pessimistic, that's your lookout on how you want to change that once your parents give you the green light. Try to broaden his mind and make him see the good in everything. If you are spiritual, or religious, try to get him to worship God, and he'll feel the difference. Surely, he makes you happy now, but 5 years is a lot, if he was 24 and you were 19, then it would understandable. but it's the other way round, and that's something society always looks down upon. You can't deny society's views, because you're still gonna have to end up living in it and being a part of it, and when things that society does not accept, happen around you, you'll also follow 'mob mentality', not thinking about what your situation was.   I've given you a lot of think about, so I'll leave it here, All I'll say is, consider everyone's viewpoint, every one who is going to be affected by your decision, and consider why all this is being said, age is after all a number, but numbers can also influence in ways that history has seen. Just be careful and make the right choice, which makes everyone happy with minimal compromises.|`|auL23826aa	age and religin is not a matter.a person when ever he loves u accepted.

AA10075228	So sorry that you have to go through this after 21 years, but do not waster any more time by looking BACK at what you had, which must not have been much.  Yes, your x should pay for your 16 year old daughter, but YOU need to get a job and then you will have some respect for yourself.  You need to get help if you have no skills to get a job, and social services and your lawyer will be able to give you some help in finding places that will train you for work.  You are not too old to begin a career in some hospital or patient care employment, try, try to get skills so that you have a decent paycheck coming in.  Make sure that your daughter knows that you will have to work harder to keep her with you, and you need her help around the house.  Good luck and have courage, you will need it to go on, but you will find that you CAN make it without the bum that you have been living with.  God bless.|`|eLIgGZiRaa	after 21 years? life sucks.....|`|EENUWAP7aa	After 21 years in a marriage you should have learned certain values and you never lose independence...it's always with you it just goes dormant.

Your best days are ahead of you.|`|9f751efea5e097481fd7c6bf7d4af274aa	All the power to you.  You will have a lot on your plate and it wont be easy at first.  Talk to some of your friends and get some input there.  Do you work now? If you havent for awhile, Id say your soon to be ex will need to be paying alimony for at least part of the time you were married. Have you gotten legal advice?   Yes, your ex should be helping out and paying for your daughter in some way. again, ask your attorney or someone you know that has been through it.    My ideas:  1) have a checking acct  2) savings acct too  3) buy an accounting ledger book to list out your bills and finances. makes it easier to track all your bills   4) make sure you deposit a little bit at least into savings every mo no matter how painful it feels to let go of your money.   5) have your job take a small amt of money from your paycheck and automatically deposit it in your savings account.   talk to your county welfare dept for advice including the local clinic or  planned parenthood for your daughter. they will have resources and connections to help you along.  good luck!|`|d8mJAuz1aa	why you want to do this. it is really really bad. you people are doing a very very big mistake. never ever do this. please try to STOP it. you both are going to cry. plesae,please,i beg you to stop this and live together. your daughter is going to suffer. you are leading a nice life. you are the best example to the new people and world. dont ever do this. please live together for the glory of GOD. you just thik of your lovely daughter and live together. why you putting her in the highy way that people run up and down vehicle.

Yes, you can get child support -  she's 16-  and unmarried.     also, don't sign off on the tax exempt for her -  keep that and don't give it to you husband.   also, as far as child support goes-  don't have that money that you depend on - because there might be times that you don't get it.    Make sure he has to pay some of the out of pocket expenses for your daughter- and also,  whoever has insurance on the child should continue to have insurance on her.   have your daughter sign up for WIC today - they will give you milk/cheese etc and once the baby arrives - you will get formula for the baby - BIG SAVINGS.  and when your daughter has her baby - have her apply for child support from the father to make her life easier too -|`|9qwBeYCQaa	There's help out there. I was married for almost 11 and kicked his butt out and he took every dime. We had 10 year old at the time. There's help for her too. State funded programs. Medicaid, WIC ( Women Infant Children) can make sure her and the baby are taken care of if they need it. As for child support, the lawyer and the state decide that. Im not sure since she's pregnant. You can do it if you just put your mind to it.  It gets easier with time. Trust me.

I guess it's just something that happens without a reason that can be understood by man."|`|dVFh97Tsaa	It could also be misunderstanding.

aXOyK3uBaa	Interesting question.    Unfortunately the "friendzone" has a door that only swings one way.    Why are you her "friend" . . . . if you want her to be attracted to you.??Get out of the "friend zone" immediately. Women dont feel a gut level attraction for men who are willing to remain "friends".??    Dont be willing to wait as long as she needs. You don't have to. There are PLENTY of women out there who will give you what you want out of life. When you are not getting it.... move on. and say "NEXT".??    You can safely assume that every woman you meet in your life will slot you into one of only TWO POSSIBLE CATEGORIES as quickly as possible .??    1. The Lover.??    or....??    2. The Provider.??    The lover --> is a guy she is "strangley" attracted to. She cant talk herself INTO or OUT OF feeling this way for him. She think about him all the time, and desire to be near him. She will want him in a way that most men WANT to be wanted. She cannot explain or understand what she feels for him and she did NOT go out and CHOOSE him.??The provider - is a guy who goes out of his way to show her that he will "provide" for her and be there for her in situations where the lover may not. She is NOT geniunely attracted to this man and I know you know what I am talking about. ??    He will "care" for her, offer her stability, freindship, security and go out of his way to prove it to her . . . even though she "provides" HIM with NOTHING the HE hopes for.     But he will foolishly continue hope that the more he does, the more she will feel attracted to him... but it will never work. EVER. This is the type of man she CAN choose to be with. ?And the more that she can choose FROM . . . the better.     There are WAY too many guys that act this way around women.??Let me say that again. She CANT "choose" to feel a true attraction for THE LOVER... but she CAN choose to spend her time with THE PROVIDER who does ALL KINDS of things for her even though she is not really doing anything to EARN it.??    There are FAR to many men in the world who will listen to women.... and sit through their stories about boyfriends who treat them badly... and these poor guys will never stand a chance with her. Wondering WHY after all he has done for her. "WHY is she not attracted to ME instead of this JERK??"??    Knowing all of this, and knowing that women always reduce every man they meet into one of these two "types", then its up to YOU to decide what kind of MAN you want to be. ??    Do you want to be the Lover???Or the provider????    Decide and act accordingly.   Whatever you do.... always remember.... ?  ?"If you keep doing what you have always DONE,?  You are gonna keep getting what you always GOT!!".|`|2iDvyoXhaa	Well you already know why it happens. So stop waiting so long.

If she does like the other guy, there's nothing you can do about it really, it's her choice and you have to respect and accept that. If you don't wana be friends with her, that is understandable or at least you don't need to be close to her. Don't worry, there are lots of other girls out there waiting for you=)
BbRewQjQaa	I'd just let her be contact once a week to see how she is doing and if she doesn't respond back with in a month quit trying.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	if she wants you she will ring back when she has time ..give her a day or two and if she doesnt reply ..move on =)|`|isxNUJlZaa	Girls don't often tell a guy to their face, "I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in anything beyond friendship," because they're taught it's rude to outright reject a boy.

6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	If I were you, I wouldn't keep in touch with her, good that you didn't respond to her message. She is selfish - 'She broke up with me because she said I wasn't there like she wanted 24/7-Didn't want anyone else to have me'. She is pretty immature, giving a very lame excuse 'talking to other people'. Don't even bother keeping in touch|`|IXskJPlVaa	You can be just friends and exchange mgs and all.

I'd warn her about what will happen if she gets back with her ex.  She'll just get hurt again .    I wouldnt get too attached. If shes not showing any feelings for you its bound to end in tears.    Tell her how you feel , speak your mind .  Its the best you can do .  Good Luck :)|`|LepOqaN4aa	Explain to her how much you like her.  And that it's hurting your feelings not knowing how much she likes you back.

It has to be on both your terms, not just hers.     My advice is to ask her, point blank, whether or not she still has feelings for this destructive boyfriend of hers. If she does, even the tiniest bit, put this whole relationship thing off the chart for a bit.    While you may want to rescue her, it seems like she's just after sex with you. And unless she will love you, the way you love her, it will be a huge waste of your time. :(    Good luck.|`|b36e4e97ffcfd1ea245a0588271a1f72aa	I would be very careful about where this girl's head is at the moment. If the ex keeps coming back to her and hurting her feelings, it means she is allowing him to come back into her life. Will she continue to do this if she is with you? Will she be using you as her rebound?  If you really want to be with her, then you should go for it but make sure you are jumping in with your eyes open. You might end up getting hurt.|`|4SvP5aiQaa	It sounds like she is playing with you but if shes not and you give her space she will probably realise that she could loose u and stop messing around like this...but even then people who keep getting back with their ex's will get back with their exs even when they are in a relationship...BEWARE!!|`|7b7pTpaDaa	You're her rebound, my love. Have fun if that is all you want, but the minute you feel yourself getting emotionally attached, you have to cut ties and stay away from her or you will get ripped to shreds.|`|lwFPjCVaaa	Whoa! U can SEE that ur the rebound guy rite? Run in the opposite direction.    Sometimes, rebound relationships turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to someone. However, that is only when she is sincerely unaware of her rebound reaction- has, on a conscious level, pushed her ex out of her mind, and SHE ADMITS TO ACTUAL FEELINGS FOR YOU.

tXlvg1ahaa	My grandma always told us this trick they used to do on men in the old days when she was a teenager.    First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.  She says that this uncertainty sparks a man's interest and keeps them pursuing the girl until she gives in.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	I don't understand why you would want to be with a guy who cheated on his girlfriend.  What if he does the same thing to you once he's with you?    You said last year you two cuddled and kissed, but the keyword was you both were DRUNK.  Being drunk does things to you.  This doesn't doesn't justify what he did, but that's probably why he kissed you.    He probably feels bad for "leading" you on, therefore still talked to you at the wedding.  If you feel like he's really into you, then why don't you talk to him about what happened and how he feels about it, rather than just saying straight out you want to be with him (which will just make you look needy)?  Talk to him casually about it and you'll definitely figure out if he wants you as his girlfriend by what he says.|`|ZaeJptPoaa	Well, you said.  "hmm."

If not start by being Friends. Complementing her is easy there are a lot of things girls like to be complemented on but basically looks . ( examples :- Hair , Dress, Shoes ..... ect ). Asking her out after your her friends is much easier. And As for the Last question. Dude the odds are she is going to say no. If she does just forget about the NO and about her. Like it never happened. Rejection isn't a big issue, you just have to move on !
gJE0ujbzaa	While it's tough for you, she did the right thing. Instead of playing two guys at once, or leading you on when she's not sure what she's feeling about her ex, she gave you space to move on if you so choose, and herself space to figure out what's going on in her own head.    Really all you can do right now, if you are still interested in her, is stick around as a friend. Just make sure you are available if she needs you.    Don't stop living though. If you see someone else you want to ask out, do it. It could be the love of your life is someone else, and her dumping you might be a blessing in disguise.|`|BeSteUwwaa	You should look at this on the bright side, instead of frowning upon it...    Its a good thing that your girlfriend called off the relationship with you to clear her head.  I mean would you really want to be in a relationship where you're girl is emotionally cheating on you?  In other words, you guys can still be together but her heart is with someone else...So the best thing to do is just give her the space that she needs and most likely you'll need space to clear your head about what you look for in a girl/relationship.    Maybe after this space, you'll find out that this relationship wasn't the best one for you... a friendship between you guys would be stronger... or you'll find happiness else where.      Good luck|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	Just tell her goodbye, nice knowing ya!.  She's a head twist.

If she told me about hers i'd bolt.|`|xV4qOG4Iaa	It depends on how long ago she broke up with her ex if it was not that long ago then it is normal that she still feels for him but not in the same way she does for you, you have to give her some time to sort out her mind, as no doubt she wants to make sure that she has got over him completely before making a full commitment fully to you. But if it was a long while ago since she finished with her ex she could still have some feelings for him but still wants to make sure that she can commit to you, as it is hard after a break up to get over an ex, so give her some time to sort herself out, she will come back to you in her own time but don't stop seeing her and show her how much she matters to you, and how much you love her as true love conquers all.|`|ReTPKcfEaa	The BEST thing you can do it just give her space  it will take time for her to realise  if she does love you she will miss you in the time you dont spend to gether  if you keep pesturing her to try and unconfuse her she will just get annoyed  giving her space will give her time she needs  if its meant to be she will come back!|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	at least she was honest about her feelings. she could have lead you on for years.|`|vG7p6pD9aa	give her some space, until she realises what she wants.

But when you split up with someone its hard to just wash away feelings.  Just leave her alone for a while and when she gets bak in touch then let her know how you feel about this x
oGoWz511aa	How does an affair become an either/or in whether your marriage works out?  If you're not getting what you need, and you've already exhausted the counseling option, what the hell are you waiting for?  Get a divorce.  Then when you have a man who "fills the blanks" it's called DATING.|`|nBQeSu2faa	A marriage doesn't go cold over night..these problems had to be coming on over the years , but sadly you never got them sorted out...now you want out.  If the problems have come over the years..then they won't be fixed in a few days. For a marriage to work you must communicate over all the years you have been married..but it's never to late to start...going outside the marriage to solve the problem  (having an affair ) is definitely not the answer. You both must want this marriage to be saved..if you do then you must communicate and then come to some agreement as to solving the problems...remember it wont happen over night ..it takes time, patience, and a for very strong desire to save the marriage.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Why did it go cold in the first place? How much of that was your responsibility, and how much was your spouse's?   How much effort did you put into the counseling, and did you give it an honest attempt? Or were you only there because it seemed like what you needed to do, rather than from any real desire to improve the marriage? Did you go in there thinking it wasn't going to work, wasn't going to change anything? Just how long did you "work" on it? Did you fully participate in the sessions, and did you do the homework after? Or think it should be some sort of magic pill that would cure anything without effort from your side? Were you only there because your partner wanted it?  Did you work on changing any of your behaviors in order to improve the relationship? Did you take charge of your part of this relationship? Or did you think it was all your partner's responsibility to make it work, to do all the changing? Did you own your part, your responsibilities? Or was it just the blame game?  In the "many days of talking it over" did you also listen to what your spouse said they wanted from you? Or was what you wanted, what you needed the only important thing? Do you think your spouse felt loved?  Have you cheated in the past, and that's what caused the distance? If so, how much did you, how hard did you work to to repair that damage?  Whatever you do, whatever you choose, if you choose to cheat that is your fault, because the right thing to do would be to work on it until you get it right, or get out fully BEFORE looking elsewhere.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Remember the reason why you guys married.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	"many days of talking it over" and counseling (what, one session)?

Define marriage going "cold".  What does that mean?  Are you referring to the sexual aspect of your marriage?  Or just the relationship as a whole?    What about your spouse?  Does he/she think the marriage is over?    Or are you making this decision on your own?|`|KKyMQlrkaa	Well, I believe that a marriage is two people who love each other very much and even in sickness and health, you stick by each other and take the good with the bad. When problems arise, as they  always do in life and any marriage, you try your utmost to work through it. You have to try to keep the communication going as without that, you have nothing, as in any relationship.Just because you are bored or are having problems, that does not and should not give you the right to have an affair or just sit and wait for someone else to come along. That is not fair on your partner or yourself, in fact it is using them until someone else comes along!  Sometimes you have to keep persevering in talking and trying to see what has and is going wrong but of course if there is nothing left then you must end it all now, not just wait until someone better comes along, that is totally wrong and just using your partner.  Half the problems nowadays, is that people have no standareds and give up so easily, you should always fight to keep what you have and make things better.   Mariage is supposed to be something that is for life not just for convienence, people do not seem to have any morals and standards today, whether it be church or Register office, marriage is still supposed to be for life.   Couple who have been married for many years have sometimes had to overcome many problems and issues, including affairs but no matter how hard it has got at times and believe me it can and does, they have worked through it, stood by each other and 40yrs or so down the line are still married and happily at that  Nothing in life is easy, certainly not marriage but it is not somethiing that should be taken lightly, as so many people do, it is something that should be very sacred and worth fighting for.  Why did you get married in the first place?  Why not start by looking at that one, then maybe you could work from there.  I know you have said you have had councilling but that does not always work for everyone, rightly or wrongly, its a fact!  "Talking for days" sometimes, i'm sorry to say, if soomething is worth fighting for then it can take months if not years even. It really depends on you both and how much you love each other, if you love each other enough then you will both give it your all, no matter what or how ever long, it takes.   You must also look at your mistakes, yes we all make them and then try to put things right, just as your partner should also.  If it really is the end, then you make other arrangements now! not just sit and wait for someone else to come along, thats just so very wrong!  You obviously have no respect for your partner, to even consider that nor yourself if you choose to take the easy way out, which is what that would be doing, instead of just saying goodbye and making a clean break.|`|pTjN7hODaa	the storm is happening and you weather threw it and read the bible and pray!  stay close to someone who is strong in the word and has a very strong family who has weathered difficult times!

DP7iyG4Laa	Simple.    Dude I tell you girls REALLY are simple. I think guys are more confusing actually.      Okay so here it goes:  They smile a lot at you. They would want to talk to you. And secretly when you're not looking, they just can't stop staring at you, but when you look right at their eyes, they'll blush and look away cuz they just can't stand your gaze. Simple, eh.      Now I wonder how do you know when a boy likes you... lol..|`|5zqfDEXZaa	if your asking she probably likes you and maybe you got a gut feeling so be nice to her and ask her out|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	*  If they stop and look at you ... if they look at you a lot ... if they laugh at your jokes ... if they gaggle and act like drunk crazy girls.         * Here's some help coming from a girls POV. If you've noticed that she has gradually began to get closer to you, ex: sitting with you at lunch, talking with you more, asking if you want to go do something, or hanging with your friends. She may also be mean to you: make fun of you when you do something stupid or have a good come back when you've completely set yourself up for it. Staring at you and looking away or acting like she was looking at something else when you notice. She may begin to take an interest in things you like and when you are sitting by her and either you arm or leg "accidentally" touches hers and she doesn't move and if she does its to scoot closer to you.         * This is coming from a girl. I'm sort of shy when I like a guy. I flirt back if he starts it, but I'm usually don't flirt with a guy I like unless I can tell he wants to. I'm usually more quite, but I smile a lot when he says something to me. A lot of times I make sure that he has a good "view" of me. When you talk to the girl you like, you should be able to tell if she likes it or not. If she laughs at the things you say, even it isn't that funny, and if she pays full attention to you when you talk to her. I think letting a girl know you like her is always a good thing, because most of the time we can sense it anyway, even if we're not sure about it. If she likes you back, she'll tell you, but if not, she won't think you're weird for telling her. She'll be flattered that someone likes her. So, flirt and if she responds well, tell her.         * All girls are different, some are the shy type, some are the more active type as in acting a bit more forward, a girl that is just naturally a shy type will express her like for you by trying to ignore u, hardly speeks to you but you will notice her stare(give you glances) and you may notice her try to look away quickly so that you don't catch her, you may even catch her smile at you at times, it will seem very obvious by the way she tries to avoid u. You'll just notice. Now on the other hand a girl that is more active will tend to stand closer to you when you talk with her and stuff... she may won't to keep talking to a bit longer as in dragging the conversation I have much 2 say on this I'm an expert.         * If you want to know if she likes you get a few people around you and ask them all who they like just so when it comes to asking the girl you like, it will seem natural that you're asking everyone. IF she stumbles for an answer or blushes or is like 'uh no-one' (giggle giggle) or looks at her friend for an answer, then you can be nearly 100% sure (not that good)         * 1. ask her friends; 2. ask her in person; 3. flirt and find out; 4. ask a friend to ask her         * I am a girl and somewhat shy, but when I like a boy I tend to look over at him a lot and smile when he talks to me (without even realizing it). If I pass him in the hallway I will poke him or hit him lightly or something too and keep walking like I didn't do it. =)         * A lot of people say that a girl's heart rate gets faster or she blinks faster if she is near the person she likes, but some raise the question "do I really have to measure her pulse to see if she me?" Well no! there is a MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH easier way. in fact, this is so easy, you will laugh at its simplicty, you don't even have to talk to her, not even look at her, you can be a deaf mute and this will work. Here is how it works: Women are territorial, like cats. if the person you like sits next to you in class, scoot a little bit close to her, like 1/2 an inch (half an inch). since women have their "personal space" and their "other people space", she may move farther away, this means that you are still in the "other people space", you don't want that, you want her NOT to move, ie. let you into her "personal space", so what you should do is: 1. Move closer to her while talking or sitting (not too close, like 1-2 inches). 2. See if she moves away, if she does not, then congrats buddy, she likes you! (because she let you into her "personal space").         * I hang out with and talk with a lot of girls and I've noticed some of their flirts: 1. A comeback that you've set up for yourself. 2. Any small tap or poke, or even just a hit on the arm. 3. Lots of laughing, smiling, staring. 4. If they pass you in a hall and say hello or do something to make you notice them.         * Also watch out. Girls like playing guys a lot. Why? For attention. They like to be "liked" or "wanted" by other guys. And its just part of the "female" genetic code.

You have more than 10 years with this man so you need to find out if he is meeting with her or not. If you love this man then you have to fight for him. Have you mention this to him? You really need to talk to your husband and you need to try to find out what is really going on.|`|pTjN7hODaa	Hello, your right on , pray about it and be ready for the answer!|`|UDInHk0jaa	Even if it is just your intuition saying so, then you are probably right.

But if it is true, I don't think he will admit. But if he does, thank him for being honest. Truth really hurts but you will surely get over it. But you really have to talk. You both have your own choices. Only you can tell if he is worth fighting for. Otherwise, you may be better off without him.

The ONLY reason I would re-locate for a man is if I had some lovely hardware on my left hand. You're clearly not ready for that.    Be smart, and don't follow your heart on this one.

If your mother do not want to listen you tell your school teacher. you need to tell people what is going on so that way someone can come forward and protect you.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Maybe you should talk to a relative (one of your moms friends maybe) or maybe you have to talk to your mum if she wont listen you must find someone to talk to her to explain whats going on! obviously the guy has brainwashed your mother if you can't get her to take you seriously. If you can get money then you should buy some lunch at a fast food restaurant on the way home from wherever you might go.

8bplNvAQaa	You couldn't say you love her because you couldn't, so don't feel bad.  Tell her you care about her and love her as a friend and person.  She wants you to be her rock and needs validation.      Deep down you wouldn't hug her because something feels wrong.  Just give her a hug next time she's not all emotional (that's probably whats putting you off).        Careful............. she might get all lesbian on you if she's feeling really messed up inside.  Positive attention from someone who really cares might be all it takes to get all sexual, andit could be you (Don't take this too seriously).    :)|`|JMjZwvPKaa	Go up to them and say, "I love you."|`|h9tUIK6Qaa	say i love you.|`|mdzIjOqaaa	1, 4 ,3 it means I(1) love(4) You(3)|`|nahohzLHaa	if you cant say i love you to her face ( in a friendly way) then try practicing in front of the mirror and then when the time comes to say it just say it to her in a comforting way you can just come out and say it in the middle of a conversation. yeah so i hope this helps|`|WRC0O6tqaa	just try to meet him alone and smile .. wink and start talking with good actions he will feel to love u atumaticly...|`|Dlfbgkv6aa	okay, question for question...    are you a boy? is the person who said i luv u a boy? this makes me thinking. your avatar is a girl right? then on your first paragraph, it says, "she"?    no offense but... are u a lesbian, or maybe "she"? or is it just your typo-thing?|`|enBBnABnaa	the next time she does something nice, make you breakfast, bring you something, just say, wow.. so glad you are my second mom!  it makes things so much nicer for me!  then leave it at that.  it sounds like it's the  truth, and you get your emotions out.. and she gets the idea that you are still her friend and care!|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	It depends on the person and the relationship we have.

"What's the secret of being smart."    There is a saying -->> "wisdom is not for everyone".  And it's TRUE. Wisdom is NOT for everyone.     In order to be smart, you must be prepared to be a "free thinker", be prepared to make up YOUR OWN mind, and ask yourself plenty of hard questions.    But the trouble with asking hard questions...   is that you won't always "LIKE" the answer.    For example... It's NICER to believe in Santa Claus.  Some people FEEL better to believe in God.    But that doesn't necessarily mean God - or Santa - exist.    Science , math, and the real desire to KNOW THE TRUTH leads to --DISCOVERY.  Most of mankind's questions have been answered that way.     Through DISCOVERY and fundamental seeking of the TRUTH.    The world is NOT really "flat" like everyone once believed it to be.  Someone had to NOT BELIEVE what everyone ELSE believed and discover it for themselves.     Being "smart" comes from AWARENESS of things an the world around you. Ask yourself hard questions. Find answers for yourself. You don't have to believe everything other people tell you.    Just be prepared to not always LIKE the answer.  Because I guarantee - you WONT.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Listening and applying yourself.|`|mqcVaxMvaa	pretending better.|`|Truakr2eaa	putting shorts up high over your shirt putting glasses on and sticcking you tongue out     LoL|`|10541eb54f0b51e5e05e9e92b9882bbaaa	assimilating and emitting information in a clear and direct manner|`|zoH6rMCPaa	My good man, the secret to being smart is this:    Do not let your wife find out about your girlfriends - If this happens you may be subjected to her leaving which would be a happy occurrance, lest for the fact that one would have to cook for himself.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Knowing the rules so you can break them as you choose.

Being in a relationship is overrated, sometimes.  When you get a girlfriend then you will be stressed over your relationship and dealing with drama.  Don't try too hard.  Try to find a girl who is into things you enjoy.  If you love video games then when you are at the game store or out playing video games see if there are any cute girl around.  Things like that.  You'll have a better relationship with someone who you share your 1 big interest with.  So if you're a huge fan of chess and play everyday, find a girl who likes chess, if you love to watch boxing all the time and you box, find a girl who is into boxing, etc, etc.|`|WV4YlqYzaa	be a gentleman..  well actually it depends..  if the girl you like is kinda naughty..  then do a daring look..  and attitude ^^  then ask the girl to go out w/you..

"Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it...It really is worth fighting for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk everything, you risk even more." - Erica Jong    "Sometimes love is stronger than a man's convictions." - Isaac Bashevis Singer    "Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness." - Oliver Wendell Holmes    "Maybe love is like luck. You have to go all the way to find it." - Robert Mitchum    "Love stretches your heart and makes you big inside." - Margaret Walker    "Love has no awareness of merit or demerit; it has no scale... Love loves; this is its nature." - Howard Thurman    "Love is like war: Easy to begin but hard to end." - Anonymous    "Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other." - Rainer Maria Rilke    "Where love is, no room is too small." - Talmud    "Loves makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place." - Zora Neale Hurston    "Love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired." - Mark Twain    "Love is more than three words mumbled before bedtime.

"hey bill, how are you and jane?" type thing. he might forget you didn't know, and he might actually tell you.
euOtDB3Baa	Ya, she feels put off because she was horny as hell.  But since you didn't, even under pressure like that, maybe you guys have chemistry.  That's the only reason I can think of why you felt guilty with this particular girl.  Like you said, you really like her, so try to mend it somehow and let her be in charge until you both decide to go for it...again.  Then the relationship should even out a little more.  But don't change too much for her.  Keep the chemistry!  It seems to be working for you.|`|Pg3voqXkaa	I think it's because you really like and care for her and so you probably want to build a strong emotional relationship before entering the sexual aspect of it.  It seems like you don't see her a worthless object but someone who is very special and so that's why you probably turned down the opportunity.      I would recommend you tell her how you feel, that you really really like her and care for her and that you want your first sexual encounter with her to be mind blowing and meaningful with all heart.  Hopefully she'll be understanding.  If not...maybe she's just looking for something physical right now.    If that happened to me, I would definitely respect your decision of turning down sex if it didn't feel right...I'd definitely be impressed and want to be with you even more!|`|GWgN3YEBaa	I think you should definitely talk to her about it and not try to just let it brush off or let her make assumptions. She might think she wasn't appealing to you. Let her know that you actually have feelings for her and didn't want to come off as only interested in having sex with her, but that you ARE attracted to her and that you'd love to have a chance to develop your relationship with her. Good luck.    But also consider the fact that she wanted to have sex right then. Be careful...she could just want that and nothing more...|`|VcrDOsFKaa	i don't think a rampant person like u shud even have thought of it again.........this tension serves u right for being so damned rampant.....|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Personally, I think you did good. Usually sex ruins a relationship if its to early in the relationship. It shows you really care for this girl.  Try telling her that, and if she doesn't under stand then forget about her.|`|AA11545997	I think you should tell her exactly what you said here.  I also have to praise you for being a Gentlemen, there aren't many out there nowadays.|`|hChy7BAPaa	well...good for you! you made the right choice! first of all...you really care about her and so you wanna get to know her before you get intimate...but if she's already wanting sex and it's the first time u guys hung out...then...eh....idk dude. she could be a..you know.. seems like thats what she's about.|`|T7vuRDCVaa	Sounds to me more like you didnt know what to do and just crapped your pants.

Don't just give her spacew because she won't understand what is going on,   She will be sitting there wondering why you turned her down.   Just say you didn't want to get too attatched if she didn't like you back.   Make her realise you wish you didn't,  But you just couldn't at that point in time.   I hope she understands for your sake.   x|`|vWrpyzQZaa	I think you should explain the situation to her. What have you got to lose if she's already ignoring you?|`|CtNs7EAsaa	sounds like shes a whore if its your first time hanging out. shes easy. thats like playing guitar hero on easy. no fun. try going for hard girls lol. much more worth it. and overall better. more satisfying.|`|7BT1MO2zaa	simple answer ur a moron|`|0pkAFo8vaa	Not a girl. But having sex with a girl doesn't "degrade" her.    What's the big deal about an intact hymen? Nothing at all. What's wrong with a girl who isn't a virgin? Nothing at all.    There's nothing wrong with a girl who wants sex. This ridiculous myth that girls who have sex the first time are "sluts" is BS. There's nothing wrong with a girl who enjoys sex. It's physically pleasurable to them too.    If you turned down sex because you feel YOU aren't ready, or you feel YOU aren't ready for that kind of commitment, that makes sense. But you certainly shouldn't make the choice because you think SHE'S not ready. Who the hell are you to judge her needs?|`|bQ2p0aa5aa	Well it sounds she might think that you are not turned on to her that way...plus girls are hoes and playes to ...well some not me..|`|xzX3NSUjaa	I think you blew your chances with this girl. Depends on how long she can hold a grudge and if she really likes you. Women hate to be turned down. We don't look at it like the guy was trying to be respectful or a gentleman..we think he's gay or he thinks we're ugly. Try explaining the situation to her. She'll get over it eventually, but you might never get that chance again.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	SOUNDS THAT YOU CARE & ACTUALLY RESPECT HER......  SO TELL HER THIS, BEFORE SHE THINKS YOUR NOT INTERESTED!

So i give you major props to that. Goodjob, and she will realize lateron that you do car about her, tell her that you didnt want to do it cause you love her too much and you think shes beautiful. I really hopee this helps you, goodluck with her. and don't stop talking, she likes it, dont worry.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Now she will think you have no dick or you are gay.    but don't worry, there are many girls out there desperate.   and I heard some girls to piss us straight people off, they try to hang out with a gay.|`|3H9k7tN5aa	explain the situation to her. it's a shame being a guy. you can't win. you be a gentleman and not wanna have sex with the girl she gets mad, you be a man hoe and try to get the draws, you a horny pervert. girls, make up your damn mind.
r1IWKjFxaa	I'd say he might still like you, but right now he's hurt cause he dropped his girl to be with you, and you're (from his perspective) walling him out.  Just send him a friendly text and say hey, how's it going.  He'll probably turn back around =P
PD9x9Oioaa	he might like u and is trying to start a conversation or he might just be flirting with u for the hell of it.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Wait.  Your /brother/ did this?  No, he is not interested.    Or if you are talking about someone you saw at the practice, I'd say I doubt he likes you, though he may be interested.
20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	sorry, but I don't think she want you back. She doesn't know how to tell you, but her silence should be telling you a lot. If leaving the message will make you feel better, then do it, but I would be surprised if she responds.  Good luck.  M|`|b5UV15gCaa	Yes I do think you should send her that about joining you for dinner. either way. if she doesn't want you to think it is over but isn't ready to talk yet she will let you know. If she responds in no way and doesn't show up you can bet it is over. Good Luck!|`|Iq0ZW0vVaa	in my opinion, temporary seperations never work......they just set a precedent that it's ok to run away when things get tough. this together with the fact that she seems to be managing fine without you mamkes me assume that this was her way to try to let you down gently.  I really don't think she'll show up for dinner....sorry......might be better to maintain your dignity...let her know that due to her apparent lack of interest you are telling her the decision has been made for her and you are moving on.  Sorry....but that's life...good luck|`|1qPH52x6aa	well id say you maybe working on yourself but so far she feels and don't see much change i would say she feels relief after all the stress she must of felt with the drinking and then sorry final straw came no job now she doesn't have to come home and wonder what kind of mood you'll be in and if u think bk she probably warned you told ya exactly how she felt and not only did you not listen you didn't believe her so now she feels like what is there to say now that will make u happy to hear so all can say is hope this helped some cause im in her shoes right now bf 18 yrs lol cant get me to budge

There you are then!     I can send you a link on "First Kiss"if you can give me an email address via my profile. This particular video is very innocent but due to the rules for under 18s who will not be allowed to view other parts of the site I cannot post here. Cheers!|`|1a38FtEcaa	you should never ever kiss a girl with a dry mouth even worse kiss a girl with dry lips its very uncomfortable.. always lick your lips better that way.|`|TsPQ6rOuaa	small amount of lip gloss is good for kissing only, but for the French kiss, dry mouth is the best
4jx4wAhgaa	I think its because she gets emotional easily and that probably she's afraid that some things in the film might happen the same way in reality! That's why I cry when watching a sad film! =D|`|qOUNCq8qaa	We're all like that.. same with "The Notebook"|`|UhK363oJaa	not all girls are like that just some
wFtL7OTpaa	just all this info ut giving me, its overwhelming  or  uh that was sarcasm Lol  or   just kidding, ur really boring (zzz)  or   ur fun to look at  or  i want to know more about u|`|BxAPrXlzaa	i think you should think of what to say yourself. or else it'll be like WE are talking to him, not YOU|`|eYq5vYm2aa	b like your relgious faith really turns me on.....and i thought it was intresting....who knew god could be sexy|`|CU1WRghVaa	lol try cuz theres so much things special about you that i like? .... xD|`|gWXjNa4gaa	u say- ur interesting  he says- how so...  u say- u don't say too much & that makes me wonder....|`|jGgRF3Yjaa	just text him this (as a joke)    in ur prayer..i simply fall in love with ur prayer.. : )|`|ziiYVYXZaa	keep him guessing...just be like "Im not sure yet"  keep it fun and flirty!|`|xv7lOjzXaa	you could say.............well your different from everyone else i like that|`|tmfKE8npaa	u should tell him how u really feel..    " i want to **** you"    i think that says it all.|`|blirKov3aa	tell him:"i found i fall in love with sb,it seems u,oh god ,what should i do,while u is seems to not like me,for avoid me love u,maybe i  should keep away from u... .."then observe his expression,if he says"we can also be friends"maybe there is less hope,anyway,don't be disappointed,we should believe as  time goes,everthing will change,including his feelings,i mean  as tine goes,he will love u one day!|`|3fda89765f589a65a49f5d607c0b4558aa	What did he say???
rg5AlVkYaa	He split over his own lack of control of his spending habits when he has no job?? That you recognized his out of control spending is a good thing. That he didn't- well he doesn't deserve your time or your heart.  Where you mean to him? Why care? What does it matter?  You are obviously more mature in your thinking then he is. You are looking for the right things in a mate- someone who can provide and who is realistic. He sounds like he has not found those values yet.   Being good in bed is only a small part of being good for you in a relationship! You value someone who is going to be responsible, it shows in your post. You can always help someone become good in bed. Do you want to become the keeper of his purse strings or his babysitter?
O36qjj7Oaa	I have only been with one man and that is my husband and we started having sex while we were dating.    He was 25 and i was 21 and we were both virgins when we met so we lost our virginity's together while we were dating.    I have never cheated and never will.|`|XTBlOf9baa	I've only had 1 partner, my husband. He's my one and only, and he's obviously the best I've ever had. I wouldn't want any other partner other than him, ever.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I had many lovers before I got married, my husband as well.     Never cheated on my husband, so zero.    I probably slept with more than I should have but I had fun at the time and I wouldn't change anything. Although I probably would have pushed for more satisfying sex back then lol.    My husband, by far, is the best BUT it wasn't always like that.. the longer you're with someone the better it gets and the more in tune they are to you. Its been 8 years and I hope it gets even better with each passing year.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	I am not married but i've slept with too many already and I am still young lol...Alot of casual hook ups and one night standers will make that tally up pretty fast.If I could go back, I'd sleep with less.My current bf is the best, my first bf was the best.The casual hookups weren't as fun for me because I like the emotional connection but they were still fun.There was one casual who had dick piercings and that was fun.|`|rH33ty23aa	More then my fair share, for sure, beforei was married at 19 and ya i cheat on him there were few after. then my current husband we have been together3 years and he is by far the best i have ever had and i would never cheat on him.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Well quite a few let's and no I married none of them; I married someone else.|`|JHfAS0VJaa	not even one|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Well there were about 45 before, and around 18 afterwards. Hmmm the best one?? Man I'm not sure how to judge that since I wasn't conscious part of the time......hmmm...I do remember being pretty sore after doing it with Roy though. I assume I had a good time there.|`|ZVb8azf2aa	1 before marriage, only happened once, was engaged to the guy for a year prior best friends 6 years beforehand, then got married only been with my husband since|`|p3AbTmbfaa	106..all protected and always use my rubber. Age 31|`|h6cYQaxYaa	I have only been with my husband before and after. He slept with one person before we met so I would either like for him not to have slept with her or for me have to slept with someone so we would understand where each other came from. But I think it would be better if he was my first too.
kjOsSmM0aa	Try cooking his favorite meal and making sure the house is cleaned up. Then let the evening pan out. If he talks, then talk back. Just let him lead things to where he'd like them to go and then don't stop him. I used to be the same way and I didn't try to rekindle the romance very well (we have 3 kids under the age of 2) and now we fight like none other. Make sure that he knows that you love him and that you don't always have to say no to what he wants. Just cooking for him and doing his laundry is a great I love you. They appreciate it.  But also, never hang up the phone without saying I love you. Never leave his presence without a quick kiss and I love you. Always kiss him hello, too. If you aren't including the romantic part, like kissing, you won't feel it.|`|igYM91eRaa	Do you have any children yet? My wife and I are the same way now that we have a 15 month old daughter cause we focus on our little one more than each other.|`|E56MF3p6aa	Yes this happens in 70% to 80% of mirrages. This is solly because either or both the partner had taken relationship for granted and does not care for the factor which they use to do before their merrage, like attracting each other by different means. Communication, physical play and most important of all is sence of humor. You can still enjoy the same intemacy if you remove the merrage factor. instead of treating other like husband / wife, treat like a friend and a lover. Its only a mind game.|`|yev2iWgWaa	break the wall first and find all good things happened after marriage. show sympathy to one who is protective to you in times of emergency who will help   only he will . it is one lifetime do not waste by thinking like this go for good movies with him share what is his opinion of that crack some jokes.live and let others live glad. love and lust are different making his favorite dish is showing your love also. flesh is perishable bond in life is immortal|`|Z614I2Yaaa	ONLY ONE YEAR LATER!!!!TEAR DOWN THE WALL IMMEDIATLY!!!

Certainly, it becomes very upsetting when your relationship starts weakening as your and your partners interest starts diverging. This condition seems inevitable in a long run. So to strengthen your relationship, here are some ways, just read them out!    Give your relationship due priority - Certainly your relationship is important for both of you. So make sure you give your relationship the utmost priority. Give work, acquaintances and solitary pursuits a second place in your life when it comes to people who really matter in your life.    Give space to each other - It is very important to give some personal space to each partner when in a close relationship. Its healthy to have different unique diverse interests and friendships in your life. Remember that these unique experiences can all-together give a new dimension to your relationship plus you never know that they may even enrich the bond between you two.    Trust each other - Remember that trust forms the basis of any relationship that you make. Feelings of doubt and suspicion can mar your relationship beyond comparison. Believe such negative attributes can undermine your relationship badly.    Value each others work -Mind it, that if your job pays twice that of your partners, it doesnt make it twice as important. Respect each other not only on personal level but also professionally. Give value to each others career goals. Remember that you both have different abilities and different goals, so incorporate respect for each other in your relationship.    Say that you care - Its so easy to take someone for granted, if you have been together for so many years. Old couples are often seem guilty of forgetting to say that they care. So make it a point of telling those important to you that they really are!    Good Luck>r

VSVQHKwKaa	Got to work for love bro...being a Christian, you know sacrifice comes before salvation.

Happy Hunting!|`|736afc7cc6a4a8fd39900662c2379a91aa	It is a normal feeling but one must discipline one self. If you find a woman to love (hope u r a male) than it is better to marry than burn with lust.Pray and ask God to help you not to lust so much and keep your thoughts pure. There are demons of lust who wish you to sin against God and your own body.Stay away from porn ....can a man put fire to his bosom and not get burned?|`|mCq2Sd7Paa	Look dude, go get laid!! Right now!! If you want to "do it the Christian way" go to Vegas and get married then get laid.|`|g5Orpmnpaa	forget what that guy just said about christians. I know a verse that can help you. Its a good verse and it talks about lust. Read Proverbs 5 the whole thing and try to memorize it. I have a problem with it too. So ur not alone. Its something we christians struggle with. Hey Im a born again christian too and I know its hard with lusting. Trust me... I know more then you know. Read Proverbs 5 It should help. Pray about it and read it and I hope God may give you peace in your heart.|`|NYmZe8QIaa	Lusting is normal not evil acting your lust out if you are committed are.  My suggestion is to take care of yourself  untill you find the one. Sex is like Chocolate you can abuse the treat or you benefit from treating yourself when in need.
1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	i dont think a judge can make you live with your ex..that would suck.   as far as counseling, that might be somthing that your state requires you have done. where i live my soon to be ex and i had to do mediation because we have a child. it was mandatory in order to get the divorce...    best of luck to you-and i hope yours goes a lot faster then mine. he filed almost a year ago and we havent even been to court yet.|`|glR5KYPuaa	In some states you have to be seperated for a year before you are allowed to divorce, and yes, some laws do require you to have a 6 month trial persiod before you can finalize your divorce, but no law says you have to live together AFTER you divorce! That's just insane!|`|AA12325447	No and No.|`|oycR65WAaa	no a judge cant make u live with him. and he will say u need to but u don't have to|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No your friend doesn't know what she is talking about a judge cant make you live together after a divorce.    And no you dont have to get marriage counseling before you get divorced.|`|fscgp7iFaa	Yeah they can make it so that you can't divorce too. And no you don't need counceling...only if a judge tells you to stay together and have counciling|`|AA12272543	I do not think that you have to go to counseling or you can be ordered to live with your ex husband.|`|AA11286626	Tell your friend to move in with the judge.

I work in Law and there is no truth to this what so ever.  You don't have to have counseling either|`|ZVb8azf2aa	Wow did your friend graduate kindergarten?  The judge can't decide where you live that's up to you.  You don't have to get counseling either.  Though most states do expect you to have proof that you've been legally separated for at least a year before they will grant a divorce. The time period varies by state.|`|RdswgYNhaa	No, a judge can order you to stay in a certain city, if there's kids involved, but he can't make you live with your ex.
PYexFeq8aa	Umm maybe next time you should ask them back how THEY are feeling!

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	because at one time this man meant the world to u, and u had expectations, and divorce means its over, it hurts to end it with someone u still love. divorce is much like a death, often much harder than a spouse dying. but life has to go on, and one does eventually decide to let go of the past, unless u let go there can't be a future.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Did you expect to file papers and walk away?

Also, if she tells everyone, as you thought she would, then when you are really into another girl, she will just know you as the freak who kissed a girl against her will.  Only kiss her if you truly truly like her and think that maybe there's a tiny chance she will be into you.|`|vTGnZsOxaa	If you feel like it, go ahead.|`|kLk60LQUaa	well if you really fill like that then yes.|`|jeTbKhbTaa	lifes about chances and living it to the fullest i say do it. lol

It sounds like you're just excited to spend time with your friend. I don't see the harm as long as you're aware of your feelings and know your boundaries.|`|M8x2btaIaa	I think you should really sort out your feelings. It seems to me that either you have a crush on him or you are in love with him. Ultimately, i guess you will always be friends, but both of you still have a long way to go and either one may make a different choice and for some reason not run in the same social circles.  What will you do then?
QAGaQUDRaa	It means you don't open up and show your flaws. Being too perfect basically means you're only letting the good parts of you be known, and hiding the bad parts (everyone has bad parts).

Z3a1cRL7aa	I have never fully understood, and I'm a guy.  I think it goes something like this:  girls are beautiful and we would like to make out with them, but even if we are making out with them we can't see what it looks like.  We could watch you make out with another guy, which you might enjoy more than a girl, but then we get jealous.  If you are making out with a girl we do not need to feel intimidated and we can just enjoy seeing two beautiful women doing something that we would like to do with either of them.  I think even most women will agree that the female anatomy is more appealing looking than the male anatomy, so it makes sense that this would bring pleasure to see.  Hope this helps. +10?|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Its the threesome idea.  they think if two girls are into each other, then they can get the two girls to agree to a threesome with them.  & they think its hott b/c they get two chicks instead of just one.|`|HOYuWR4gaa	double the pleasure, but i would take a 3 some over that any day!|`|PO5Q7POuaa	I ask myself this constantly as well. I mean why do they get such sick pleasure from girl on girl action? Would they like it if girls suddenly took a sick pleasure to boys making out with each other? I think not, because then they would be disgusted. I always don't understand why its so amazing for guys to watch girls making out with each other, because if they like the girl... but she's making out with another girl, isn't she not interested in boys? Haha if that makes sense.  Boys confuse me, they need to write a book of the way their brains work =D|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	It's a conformist idea that disgusting guys have with each other. It's shallow, and if a guy asks you to do that and you don't wanna, kick his @$$.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Because lesbians are always hot.
BI8c6XXPaa	Just go slow. It will seem unsatisfying because you won't be able to thrust but keep in mind that the more you do it, the better she will feel. And it hurts me every time I have sex, I just have to ignore the pain, and it eventually goes away. If you finish, and she doesn't, you can always touch her and make her finish.|`|N19mmDELaa	every girl is different. it was great for me. lol.|`|1FAggU5Zaa	how old r u>? if ur under 18 then wait u will regret it...    1. it depennds on the girl if it hurts ( it did hurt me)   2. depends on the girl i didnt bleed...... ps.. im 20 now    i lost my virginity when i was 19 =) with my boyfriend that waited for me im still with him and im married now....|`|C28tF09Faa	Never enjoy the first time cuz it can be painful and they dont have a clue what to expect...after all its their first time...maybe by the 5th time or so they'll be more into it|`|XR0VnlXjaa	The answer leads more to "No." I heard somewhere that only about 10% of girls actually enjoy their first time.  90% of girls have bad experiences.|`|6boH5X5Baa	i had sex with my boyfriend about a couple of months ago and that was because we felt realy sure of us and of course i felt pleasure|`|blirKov3aa	i think it is>>2 times|`|LyiX8NsXaa	it burns like a *****,  second time is pleasuring.|`|kMpgMplmaa	gee i dont know my girl did, or at least thats what i know from what she told me|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	If the man is really gentle and know what he is doing then the girl would surely enjoy her first time. As for me, I did not! the guy seemed clueless and I was clueless too! lols! I think it gets better the more you do it.|`|x9PQQGybaa	hmmm idk it depends.. it may not hurt for the girl at all because she may have lost her hymen already but still, she could be extremely tight.. i agree with the other people maybe on her second time she will feel pleasure , maybe it will take more times ..i hope this helped =D|`|AA10178659	You are a naughty boy.|`|Cpr9rArVaa	sorry but it actually hurts the whole time my advice is to please here while being inside her like kissing her asking here if shes ok rubbing her on all sorts of her body that takes her attention off of the pain.|`|zRyGcN6yaa	Horror first time Pleasure second time. My friend tells me everything|`|PS4QL0oVaa	i had a 10incher my first time. still with him. it felt GREAT!!! and first time turned into 2nd and 3rd and 4th in the same day!!!
71VRvldJaa	It certainly isn't anything like you see in the movies or read about in romance novels.  If girls are brutally honest, they would have to tell you that the first time isn't anything to write home about.  It takes a lot of time and patience to develop a good sex life.  It's not going to happen overnight and it can often take a couple of years before you really learn about each other's bodies and develop that sense of intimacy..  When I hear 14 and 15 yr old girls talking about how great it was, it really makes me laugh because I know they're full of crap!  They are just saying what the guy wants to hear from them.|`|s4iVl04raa	Yes and no. It's exciting and scary at the same time. It does really hurt, and no you don't really feel much pleasure out of it the first time. It takes a couple times for some girls to get comfortable with their body the way it feels having sex for them to actually enjoy it and find their "groove". Since you are both virgins though, it will definitely make her more comfortable I think and she won't be as self-conscious! The first time I had sex it was with another virgin so I didn't feel intimidated! :)|`|6boH5X5Baa	wow i just answered the exact same question like a inute ago okay me and my boyfriend had sex a couple of times and only because we were sure of our selves and we really loved each othe he was really gentle and i really enjoyed it the only advice i can give is use the right protection think of the girl u don't want to get her pregnant and be very gentle if ur gentle she can really feel pleasure|`|YfoYgjB0aa	It hurt like ****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but my bf was a virgin too so he really didnt know what he was doing..........just make sure you know what ur doing and im pretty sure she can def feel pleasure the first time    just remember to make her feel comfortable and have a lot of fore play first to get her ready    and use a condom lol|`|oM7bXmkvaa	Me and my bf were both virgins when we decided to do it.    It hurt, but I enjoyed it because I love him.|`|yrtjHmHzaa	It only hearts when not fully involved, pain is like getting your tooth pulled out by dentist one moment pain is there other moment pleasure.
fUuYcX3faa	ok i have an idea if she read your blog!!  first you have to talk to her in a happy manny k? like talk to her for like 5 lines (back and forth) seem happy then say you have to go before you peers give you crap! this will make her think "he is happy" he wasn't shy or nervous around me "maybe it was someone else"  and if this helps. write a blog that your glad this "girl left your life forever because things got complicated"  that will solve her mystery about it. just flirt a bit and walk off. do minimal talking for about 2 weeks then get more friendly and hang out! k? good luck :) i believe in you!!!
9DtJeAUKaa	Wow, that's not even a hard one!! DUMP his arrogant, pompous, controlling, LAME, self absorbed, cocky, pathetic azz...like yesterday! Seriously, honey, he is so using you & probably laughs about you behind your back. For him to blatantly spell it out for you & you're still w/ him only inflates his ego & he probably thinks your an airhead...or worse depending the level you all have taken your relationship. He's using you & he's a JERK!     The best thing you could do is throw a loop in his juvenile game & break up w/ him & not act like it phases you one bit. In fact, even if you have to get a male friend he doesn't know to pose as your new bf just to flaunt it in his face & show him just how little he means to you...do it. That'll bring him back to Earth a little bit.    Mygawd, he is such a loser. Give him the boot & NEVER look back...if you're smart.|`|DFoBVHw8aa	let it go|`|blgRK8Ebaa	If you really want to stay with him then just be patient, stick it out.  If it is meant to be then he will def. come around|`|n195n9Avaa	You two obviously aren't looking for the same things so the answer is simple...dump him and move on.|`|zY64xc6xaa	Dump his immature commitment-phobic azz and find someone who does want a stable, happy, LTR.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	He's not being unfair.  you're being unfair to yourself by staying with him when what he wants is different than what you want.  If you want something you have to go out and get it not wait around for things to change.  And hes going to get sick of you?  break up with him and let him get sick from being without you|`|zdqAmFXjaa	how can you stay with someone who does not want to be with you...sorry relationships dont work that way..sounds a little stalkerish if hes like " i dont want to be with you" and you are saying you are together.    take the hint...go find someone else and don't return to him in a year. sounds like he wants to sew his wild oats.|`|yZrVMIs1aa	NAg and berate him until you end up on Judge Judy or get the minimum of self respect and pride and move on.|`|bmf8ed7Haa	Get over it.  He's using you like a tool.  Doesn't sound like a love-worthy trait to me... put your hormones on the back burner and use your head for a second.|`|823yhUuSaa	dont get cought up and get your self hurt  . get rid of him. and find your self a man that wants one|`|AA10761300	consider him optional|`|F6znYVAwaa	drop him babe|`|3PbE211Waa	Your boyfriend is being completely unfair. Every girl deserves to be with a guy who wants to be with her and love her completely, who wont ever "get sick of her". If you stay with him, he gets the best of both worlds. He gets a girl who he gets to hook up with who is devoted to him, without actually having a girlfriend and gets to be single. If you really do love him, say bye for now, maybe when he grows up a little and can handle a long term relationship things will work out. Good luck!|`|f4948af1972489366cde074ab64b0d89aa	If he respects you so little, then you should find someone who does respect you.  If you reallt love him, make him understand that and make it work between you.    The decission is whether you love him more, or if you think he's more unfair and disrespectful.|`|CLvUYnRRaa	It's simple, he is tripping and you looking for more. So basically, move on and if it meant to be you 2 will be 2gether, if not at least you stop wasting each other time and moved on. Some one out there want what you want, so why wait.|`|HpMXIlLVaa	You are still young, and there is a whole wide world out there for yours to take. Do something you like to do and pursue it.  Enjoy your outings with friends.  One day something magical will happen and you'll be happier for it, because you have enjoyed everything you wanted to enjoyed.  School, career building the whole nine yards.     Let him go.|`|2448b2a74e26e1fd5c72db2621420e5aaa	I think you are kind of wasting your time, because he said he'll get tired of you sooner or later, and that's not what you want to hear when you are looking  a long term relationship. I think that's kind of rude and mean of him to even say that! I don't think you should stay with him until he decides, because he can string you along and you would end up with a really bad broken heart. Its better to end it or confront him and give him a choice to decide if he want to be in a relationship with you or not, because its not fair to you. And you don't know how long it will take him to decide. You should take charge and really confront him before anyone gets hurt, and 'breaks' never work, people think that if they take a break things will cool down and go back to  the way it was, but in some cases it doesn't and they are in a unhappy relationship.|`|FM2YIhcuaa	Leave him. It will only hurt more if you continue to stay with him.|`|4PV0o4pBaa	stay with him but dont get too attached or just leave|`|rmVHorS9aa	take out a mortgage|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	dump him now, you'll be hurt even more later TRUST ME!|`|aQWhSYn3aa	The best way to go is to tell him how you feel about him. Good luck ;)|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	Date someone else. Duh.    ...If you don't stop dating him, I'm going to have to track you down and slap some sense into you.    How's this for "unfair": expecting someone to change their lives and their feelings just so you don't get hurt. Sorry honey, but that's not how life works.|`|bd61c4ced48d00aa8ba044c678e51aa9aa	Does he have to hit you with a shovel?  He's trying to dump you with not-so subtle hints.  It would so be a waste of your time to stay with him.|`|it3WLDTKaa	I've told nine ex-girlfriends the same thing, now they are EX's.  It means they only want something casual. Don't stick around if you're not prepared for giving an emotional investment and not getting anything back.|`|pyJXFFMAaa	Very, very gracefully let it end. You will be suprized by his initial reaction AND that he will probably come back to you before he thought he would.|`|2hbPtlVmaa	"i dont want a lonq term relationship" is code word for,  "i wanna **** u and thats all"    just be careful qirl he miqht not be the one for you if you're lookinq for a deep connection. he's obviously not ready, and even if you were his dream qirl, you cant chanqe a quys mind on subjects like this. he is younq and still a horndoq... just qive him time|`|AA10691904	Just let him go his not worth it, If he realy loved u he would never say something like that. Just forget him and move on to someone who really loves u and that will never let u go :)|`|4sRvEHdRaa	yes! That is a waste of your time. If he's telling you up front that he's going to get tired of you, you need to dump him. You don't deserve that. find someone that will treat you right and want to be with you. Don't give him the time of day. he obviously isnt mature enough to handle a relationship and you dont want that. good luck|`|a5ab055761c41a22c7eb1147a5a944a3aa	Simple, you break up with him and get with someone that is looking for what you want.  Life is too short to be wasting time with anyone.  If he's telling you up front that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you then that is exactly what you'll be doing..wasting time|`|pfmo44KVaa	JUst be honest with yourself, dont mind what he told you about along term relationship or short Term,..or whatever... as long you are true and happy.." just go with the flow". But make sure you know the limitation, dint go beyond... make sure that there's a space for yourself and to your love one...show respect both..... It is better to give than to receive, right?!!!  We know that if God's will, ...you will  be meant  for each other....no matter what... Dont make stress of yourself, because of  the "phrase"...HELLO, " i am not looking for a long term relationship....."....most of the guy will tease our limitation and patience..... just stay calm and cool... i know on the next around, you will be stronger and have more confident..trust me... you can manage yourself and you will be happy...  Good luck to your love life....|`|1hciyvKdaa	Um hes basically hoping you get the drift, and sees your not, hence the well get back together in a year........hes done, move on. Cant force anyone to love you or want you. Sorry you will get better next time if you set your standards higher.|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	He's playing with your mind! He probably does not want to have a long term relationship but he wants to see what you will do. How you are going to react to him saying that "i don't want a long term relationship". I don't know why but a lot of guys get off on the fact that they have a woman who will stick around even though they don't care if they are with them. I'm not going overboard with this too. So many men play this game and it usually works out in their favor. They want to know that you will be there for them when they want you.   Don't be a victim to this game.   Leave him and don't let him know for a minute that it's bothering you.  You're too good for that!  Good luck!|`|SFoMSEpgaa	There are still good men out there to be setting around waiting on that..Ditchem for sure.|`|2fZKpW9yaa	you should dump the loser... if he is not looking for a long term relationship then he is looking for a short physical relationship. you're being used! he is being unfair and has an utter disregard for your emotions... trust me he is not what you're looking for in a guy!|`|AA11423026	To keep it short, forget him.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	If you are looking for a long term relationship and he has told you he is not then I would leave him and move on.  It will be hard to do this but the longer you stay with him the harder it will be to leave.  You will also be wasting your time with him because he is never going to change.  If that is what you are willing to settle for then stay but if you want a long term relationship or to get married some day, then I would recommend you leave.    But we can't tell you that just give you advice.  You will have to make the decision yourself.  Good luck to you but my advice would be to leave.  It doesn't matter if he is being unfair or not.  He is telling you that he isn't looking for anything long term.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	find someone else|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	i would dump him before you develop stronger feelings|`|py57svUyaa	get rid of him|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	he dosent want the same as you better without him|`|U4qK4YBgaa	Follow your heart on this one and protect yourself. If hes sure that is what he wants.... then find someone else.|`|bzfXbM4raa	What a dick.  "I like you now..but I'll get bored of you in a year...so you know..."    Tell him you're bored of him now, and dump his idiot ***.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Leave him.  He is looking for someone he thinks is better for him than you.      How would you feel if a guy you didn't really like insisted on sticking around?  A little sorry for him, perhaps?    He's dumping you, he's just too cowardly to come all out and say it and you are wasting both of y'alls time by not seeing it.
XLtDhidJaa	i'm not too sure. usually there is detailed instuctions on the box as to what time is appropriate to do the test.    If you really are worried I suggest you book a doctors appointment & he/she can help you figure things out.    If you do not want to go to a doctor then buy another pregnancy test & use it in the morning after you wake up. Try not to drink/eat anything that will alter the result.  Usually, if the test says you are not pregnant. then you are not pregnant. But it might pay you tp double check.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	it depends on how close you take the test to your period. like if you take the test 2 days before your period, the redult will be more accurate than if you take it 6 days before your period.|`|f1i6DPHFaa	Tests can always be wrong. If you really think you're pregnant, go to Planned Parenthood, and depending on income, you may be able to get a free pregnancy test where they have you urinate in a cup and they look at that. This is much better than the store tests as well.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	o girl u prego|`|6GUpUXoXaa	i don't think it would effect a prenancy test by what you drank but if you peed a lot before you took the test it could have effected it that way ... take it the firs thing in the morning because it will work the best|`|QADhk0nFaa	you should get another one lol this is weird but i watch mythbusters and they did a test on that stuff and like the seeds on top of hamburgers can make it so your pee test turn positive .. when you pee on a pregnancy test weird huh? so just calm down and take another it will be okay:D|`|JqfIJtvYaa	Yes, the tests go by your hormone levels, and if it had been a long time since you went pee than the h. levels will be more concentrated. If you have had alot to drink than they will be weaker. In my experience though, it has not mattered. Your state of mind can have a big impact on your body, causing you to miss or be late occasionally.|`|cl1pJK38aa	It has nothing to do with what you drink.  They say to take pregnancy tests in the morning because there are more hormones being passed through your urine (the kind of hormones those tests look for) the first pee of the day.  The test is probably still accurate no matter when you take it, as long as you have missed your period.
757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Hi, you are exactly right. I was the same. I didnt expect (or demand) that my bridesmaids do anything except wear the dress and stand up there.     This nonsense about bridesmaids "not fulfilling their duties" sickens me. I just answered a question where the asker (the bride) was considering firing or warning her bridesmaid, because she wasnt helping planning the wedding!     If a bridesmaid wants to throw a shower and/or help plan, great. But it is not obligatory.|`|ynBEFO5Caa	Yup, you've got it right.     Oh, they might really like to go shopping for dresses and help with wedding favours and taste cakes -- because we females like shopping with our dearest friends. But that's not an obligation, it's a choice. It would be nice of you to invite them, purely because they ARE there for you as your friend, not just during your wedding but in your life.    They probably WANT to do nice things for you, maybe a shower or a girl's night out (which they may call a "bachelorette") and if they invite you, you'd be unkind to turn them down -- but you don't assign that kind of thing as a job.    Maybe, if you keep it up, you'll set a fashion for good manners and thoughtfulness!|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	You are right on track. Being a bridesmaid is an honor, not a job.     When I was my bf's maid of honor, I did plan the shower, the bachelorette party, went dress shopping, planned the menu, etc., because I WANTED TO! Not because she demanded it. I happen to like planning events and parties and I like shopping with my best friend. She never asked me to do a single thing. She was the most awesome bride ever and we had a wonderful time in the year before her wedding.     I have been in other very close friends' weddings where the brides were so horrible, none of the people in the wedding even speak to each other a year later. I even had one bride call me after the wedding and scream at me because I missed a last minute dinner a week before the wedding when her friend flew into town. It wasn't to discuss wedding stuff or anything like that; she just wanted to get together (for the 4th time that week). The reason I didn't go? 1. I had to work on a deadline that was moved up and due the next morning. 2. I couldn't afford it after spending over $800 on a dress, shoes, jewelry, a shower, a bachelorette party, a gift, a birthday gift for her fiance (his birthday was on the day of the wedding and she wanted us to make him feel "special" so she asked us all to get him a separate b-day present), and paying for the vases for the centerpieces for which I was never reimbursed. I also bought and cooked all the food for a bachelorette party for 25 girls. But according to her, I ruined her wedding week because I did not go to dinner with her and her friend (I wasn't a MOH mind you, just a BM) and therefore am a selfish b*tch. Who would want to be in weddings where the brides are like this?     So yes, you have exactly the right idea, as did my best friend. Bridesmaids are people that you want to surround you because you love them, not to do your bidding whenever you bark out an order. And if you treat them like a friend and not a maid, they'll probably bend over backwards to do anything to make your wedding fabulous. Maybe you can set a trend and brides will stop treating bridesmaids like house servants.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	LOL on your question wording.    We did exactly what it is you stated you envisioned. We simply wanted our attendants to stand up for us - and they did. They were there to support us and love us - witness our vows at the ceremony, and celebrate with us at the reception.  I never understand all the tasks some brides here on Answers ask of their attendants!|`|i41tUVtIaa	You can ask them if they would also like to help serve. Some people see it has a honor.  But some people do think that a bridesmaid is just for standing at the alter with.  I had separate people for servers because the bridesmaids will probably be helping you either eat without getting it on your dress or if you change before leaving they will help you.  And they could be "fixing up" the car.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	actually your on the right track, all the bridesmaids are supposed to do is support you and help out a little if need be, they are not your servants and if you were asking them to do everything for you they might resent you and quit.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	You are SO right on this.      I don't know where this idea came from the the MOH is "expected" to do certain things and the bridesmaids are "expected" to do other certain things.  That's just NUTS!    When I married, I expected to do the planning and organizing.  If my bridesmaids helped out, that was a bonus.  For me, because it meant I didn't have to do it all myself.  For them, because they could feel good  about doing something nice for someone else.  For all of us because we could enjoy each others company while engaging in the task.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I don't understand the people that think their BMs are supposed to help them plan the entire wedding.    The expectations I have for my bridesmaids are to get me their measurements on-time so the dresses could be ordered (I bought their dresses), to have them altered in time for the wedding (that is their expense), and to show up on-time for the rehearsal and wedding.  That's it.  End of expectations for the bridesmaids.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Nothing pisses me off more than when I see these spoiled brats coming on here complaining because their bridesmaids haven't put their entire life on hold for their wedding.  Like everyone should bend over backwards for them and drop everything they're doing when the bridezilla needs something.  And if the bridesmaid doesn't comply, out she goes.      Bridesmaids are not personal assistants.    One of my bridesmaids, who is a close friend, has been helping me out a lot only because she loves planning events, especially weddings (every time family or friends get married, which has been a lot recently, she gets involved).  I never asked my bridesmaids to do anything for me, except get a dress and stand up at the altar with me.  Any help I have received has been offered to me, not demanded by me.
ise05jjUaa	I would have to say if her weight is proportionate to her height & she's got curves in all the right places she's perfect.  I love a woman who's in between, not to skinny, definite turn-off being able to see her ribs & one who's not to big.  So yes definitely somewhere in between, a want a lady who I can't hold onto & is comfortable with herself.  I don't care to much for women who are skinny, no curves, if so I might as well be with another dude.|`|zvW5rBIZaa	petite, one head length shorter than me, average, small-medium boob or anything proportional (no playboy-esque big boob, no flat jacks either). average ***. long legs. chubby legs are kinda of a turn-off. yup.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	i like all types unless the girl is like 500 pounds but i prefer petite girls, and ilove a great smile and eyes oh yea and a nice tight toned body|`|s7UZZbVhaa	Ashley|`|t4hXgUh1aa	i'm a girl, but most guys love either big butts or big boobs or hey both if they have them lol  Of course guys like hips and love legs.  They usually like them not super skinny but not fat.  Some like big women though and some like skeletons.  Some like short, and some like tall or medium.  Honestly for every body type, there are plenty of men that like it, you will be amazed.|`|v3xKtEPVaa	have u seen a barbie?! :)|`|U22nd6Aaaa	If we're talking about body type alone I like shorter girls with an average to curvy body type. Breast size I prefer medium to smaller size but its not that important. Not a huge fan of really skinny girls or big butts.
U8oR3VU6aa	Now is not the time to be needy. He needs you to be there for him when he can make the time. He needs your support, not nagging and making demands. He misses you as much as you miss him, but he is trying to start building a life and a career and if you want to be in it with him, be the best you can be for him when he can be with you. You just miss him and got use to having him around. When you are together make the best of every minute. In the long run it will pay off especially if this is the guy you want. Good luck.|`|HFmh8uF4aa	Be trustworthy and he will be too. Dont always assume the worst also make sure u stay open minded. it is the best thing to do.   Try to conatact him for a change....|`|kMpgMplmaa	Honsetly I think your thinking to much. Sometimes guys need space, and we dont know how to tell you. I think he'll be back strong as ever. Or he just might be going through something too. never know  just give it time|`|CU1WRghVaa	idk i feel like you got ditch............not sure try calling his phone|`|sgRDJUXqaa	If his career is time consuming, she should stop freaking out.  He's busy!  And sorry if she's not the first thing on his mind when he's trying to balance two jobs and making some tough decisions about his future career goals.    She should call him and tell him she loves him and supports his decisions.  Right now, he needs her support, not nagging about why he hasn't called.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	That would drive me insane!  Has she tried calling him?  If  not she really should... if she has and he didn't answer then he probably isn't worth her time.. she can't get her self wrapped up in something that is shady    if he's going to start keeping stuff from her now then what will he do in the future?|`|uU1oLpdDaa	Panicing is never a good idea. You need to be patient and understanding and just check in on him every once in a while. He may be feeling overloaded and stressed out and may not want to talk to anyone right now. Don't push the issue or you may end up pushing him away. Just be patient.|`|rZGJ5xrwaa	i think that you guys need to take a day off were it could be a day with loving and just you know hang out like have a picnic go out to eat tell him your feelings!i think you guys would be a more better couple because you guys are spending more time together.
BgVWSApdaa	I took a quick poll with my daughters who are both 6 feet tall and beautiful.  I read them your main question and they yelled "No!" in unison.  One of them said "He's just perfect!"  Just thought you should know...|`|w2yh8Acraa	you must be too pimp for them.... well i would be happy to be ur prostitute! ;) lmao jkjk! idk...|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Hard to say because I don't you know you.   Maybe you just give off an intimidating vibe sorta thing. Maybe it is your size. .|`|uKYPmVG0aa	gawd no.. im 5 4 and my bfs r always 6 1 and up. they always let me stand on top of their shoes to kiss them and they give me piggy back rides. they sometimes make fun of how short i am.. but in a cute way. just don't date anyone under 5 ft.. that would look bad!|`|zstlBi3aaa	No way! Tall guys are really attractive. I like to be dating a guy atleast over 6ft. My last bf was 6'5 and i'm only 5'5.|`|gy2s8og3aa	hell no! girls luv tall guys|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I'm 5'3 & most of my boyfriends were over 6'  but the tallest I ever dated was 6'6.  I think its attractive when guys are that tall.  A lot of girls tend to feel really small & dainty around tall guys, but they can be intimidating too.  |`|BeAVEk2yaa	NO! For sure, no.    I'm 6'1 myself.   I wish there were more tall guys out there. :)|`|2DKu5WzNaa	when your only 5ft|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Definatley not!  I am always looking for tall guys because I am at least 6'1.  I tried dating a short guy once and it just was far too awkward.  Maybe start checking out all the sexy tall girls and maybe they'll be interested ;)
9pY7Sc47aa	I've always liked short pretty girls.  There's just something about them, they are very very cute, and I'm totally attracted to them.    But of course I like all kinds of girls!    =)|`|sPZW8Bcyaa	I've always loved short pretty girls, my problem is that im 6'2, I figure girls aren't into guys extremely taller than them. It kinda sucks.|`|1XAp4woVaa	no i like tall ugly ones.|`|OQqAlHL8aa	I'd be fine with that. Although I'm 6'3 so it might be kind of awkward. maybe set your sights in the 5 foot range. I think most guys would like a short girl because they can feel like they are strong and protective.
1FAggU5Zaa	omg ur a sycooooo how could u think like that..    WHAT IS THIS WORLD TURNING INTO NOW??    1st is gays then lesbians then related people yuck!|`|rKsgGHKkaa	yes thats weird. im sorry to say it but it is weird.|`|3XKUUf1paa	your nasty, well it was common back in the 1500/1600's. today, no WAY!!!|`|P9oduCUgaa	koo koo
173vsiacaa	if you're a virgin and still have your hymen attached, depending how the thickness of your hymen, the amount of pain is variable - the thicker, the higher possibility of it hurting|`|VIDh3oUVaa	mmm naaa my gf told me it didnt hurt as much like she spected and it only lasted a moment mmm ull feel weird first but ull get used to it very quick... and ur gonna enjoy it trust me ;D|`|VU4DLpnlaa	it doesn't hurt too much, half way through my first time i almost begged him to stop but didn't because the pleasure was amazing.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	take drugs u wont feel a thing|`|6GUpUXoXaa	it depends on the person but it shouldn't hurt to the point where you are crying or anything.  If you feel uncomfortable once you get started let him know that your uncomfotable if he doesn't understand then don't waste your time|`|Umsj08pnaa	It will probably be uncomfortable, but then after a while it will feel better.|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	only just to start with, bad but bareable, and it will go away quite quickly. it will maybe happen the first 2 or 3 times you have sex, or it may not hurt at all. get ur guy to finger you first, that will help reduce the pain. but mainly just try to relax and it shouldnt hurt too much|`|ql0RmOLiaa	it didnt hurt at all for me|`|cl1pJK38aa	It will feel uncomfortable at first, but it won't hurt for long.  Trust me, you'll get used to it.|`|uz0R5pjHaa	For they guy itz fun but for the girl it's pain, blood and tears... well only the first few times|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	Not a bit, feels quite good.|`|IhNWxLNxaa	it hurts for lyke to mins then its better then better then better then better just do it if yuu wannt to dnt let a guy pressuer yuuu in to it
TKHA5okpaa	It depends on alot of things...  You said you use to talk online everyday, then never anymore.  So you talked online everyday for like a week or a month or a year?  Also I wish i knew if she just stopped suddenly one day or if it gradually faded over time.  I dont want to be mean or hurt you but I've been in this same situation.  I talk to guys for days and days, online or even on the phone and it's for fun, it's something to do to pass the time you know. Then the guy starts calling or writing every single dam day and dear it gets annoying. It's like s**t can you chill out guys.  Also the communication between you guys was open when you were talking online, one thing you HAVE  to know about us girls is that if we like you back YOU WILL KNOW!   Even is she's surrounded by friends she would be sending you some signals.  Hmmm. I'd really like to know if the little brat blocked you though.  Definitely DO NOT tell her you like her, I know you want to so badly let it out but first be very casual, casually ask her almost bump into her and say it very light heartedly "hey how come you dont write me anymore" She'll say something I'm sure that will give you a clue on where you stand with her.  Make sure you dont act like it's a question you've been thinking about over and over and writing on yahoo answers!!!!  Just say it very casually like a buddy kinda way.  OOOOOHHHH I hope everything works out. Good Luck.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Ummm I blocked a lot of guys on myspace, and i deleted my messenger for the same reason.  Maybe she feels kind of stalked by you.  Just leave her alone, if she wanted anything to do with you she would have acted on it by now.|`|l435VrtUaa	Well if you had a bond with a girl then it probably means more the her than it does to you. She's probably upset at you and before you talk to her about it you need to figure out what you did. Think of all the things you talked about and try to figure out what may have made her upset.  It may be tough but try to figure it out first. If you can't figure it out then ask her what's wrong. Try to make it up to her as much as possible if you screwed up. If your relationship healed over this bump in the road, make sure you have more physical contact with her- verbal communications in person over online chatting. If she's really upset and you have no way to fix the reason she's upset, tell her that you like her then. Just say to her that you've liked her for about a year now and even if she's upset at you, you'll always be there for her. You need to understand that she may reject you, but if you really like her then you should be happy with whatever decision she makes. When you talk to her about the issue, make sure you do it in person. Take her from her group of friends and ask her if she has a minute and if you can talk to her. Try to convince her it's important (since it is!). Make sure you say whatever you feel and make sure you mean EVERY WORD of it!  Wish you luck!|`|l01wsneiaa	What did you say last that would make her want to block you?  Wait a little while to see if she just hasn't been on, and you should check with a friend who has her added to make sure that she did/didn't block you.  I wouldn't recommend making a fake account because I feel like she would know it's you (maybe if you waited a long time before you made one...).    But then when you find out if she did, just forget it. I think it'll make matters worse if you tell her you like her after she blocked you, because she quite obviously doesn't want to talk to you.  If she didn't block you, you should go ahead and tell her how you feel - might as well, right?    How old are you? You sound sort of young, don't worry, you'll go through this a lot, you'll forget all about her soon!    I know how frustrated and hurt you must feel, but be strong :)  Save your heart for someone who's saving theirs for you (aww cute - I just made that up! :D)
axogVBmCaa	Hi    I think you need to take a look at what sort of things you say to her, and whether you may have offended her. Sometimes stuff just slips out of your mouth and you didn't even think and it came out, and you can't take it back.    Possibly, she may be a little crowded, I mean, I'm only guessing, but maybe she figured out you liked her, and felt a little wierded out. I was friends with a guy and all of the sudden he asked me out, and I was really wierded out.    Maybe she likes someone else. Theres tons of other guys out there.     I dont think at school would be a good place to tell her you like her, and I think you may regret it if you tell her in front of your/her friends. Tell her when it is just the two of you away for everyone else. Wait for the right moment.     Also, don't go overboard serenading her or anything, tell say to her, "I really like you, do you wanna go out sometime?". Or just tell her you like her. Short and sweet.    And, hey, look, if she doesn't like you back, its okay, I mean, I liked a guy for 4 years, told him, and he told me he didn't like me. Yes, I was hurt, but I told myself that there were guys who would stick red hot bamboo slithers up there fingernails to go out with me, so there. Also, there is nothing wrong with being good friends instead :)    If she does like you back, congrats. Be kind to her, treat her, take her out, tell her shes pretty, ask about her, hug her when shes sad, and don't treat her differently depending on who's around.    Goodluck :)|`|fCzlPJ8raa	If she did block you, as mean as it sounds.. just give up. That girl shows no interest in you or she just doesn't want to talk to you at all. If you want to tell her you should just call her up or something and confess how you feel for her. Or ask one of her friends to talk to her for you? Good luck!|`|ChMTXl3saa	Let it go. Find someone else..You will in time|`|86f625d9ffc20e37a8b5cc419322fe53aa	if it has been over a year then you blew your chance, she blocked you because your a loser and never told her you liked her. your still young and do not know the women are the root of all evil, not money as suspected.|`|UhK363oJaa	all i need to say is  do whatever your heart tells you to do     not your mind... but your heart     that is the BEST advice anyone could ever give..|`|LojhyKJhaa	I was in the same situation and know where youre coming from. Just take it from lilsanti889. even though it will be hard, try to move on or just play it cool around her. dont only depend on an IM service though. get the balls to talk to her in person. u can do it dude. just be cool and u shud be ok. dont panic.    IMB|`|ShLuWq1Eaa	DUDE ABORT SHIP!!     She blocked you for a reason, please don't tell me you scared her away.    If she blocked u for another reason then nvm... but if she just blocked you out of the middle of nowhere then don't even sweat it    its going to hurt bro, but you have to get over it.. what doesn't kill you makes you stronger am i right?    Just play cool, act like this doesn't bother you man... have her talk to you first and if the time is right then you should tell her    good luck bro|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Aw that sucks if she blocked you and I know how it feels, the guy I like constantly blocks me because he takes my sarcastic comments seriously.   You should ask her in an e-mail maybe to unblock you? Or if your not too shy talk to her in person about it.   If you're ready to tell her how you feel go ahead and let her know, this might make her understand more and who knows maybe she feels the same way. If you have her phone number you could always tell her over the phone or through an e-mail again. And also I am sure she is not ALWAYS surrounded by friends. Maybe go over to her house one day afterschool or something and talk to her in private then. Or send her an e-mail asking her to meet you somewhere.  Good luck|`|HjvSzQ6Faa	if she blocked you    it might mean she doesn't like you    sorry dude|`|AA12371982	Well if she blocked you, then she doesn't want to be bothered with you. MOVE ONNN|`|0U29DjU7aa	When you would like to ask a girl out, just find the right time and place to ask. Sometimes you will just be hanging out, talking, when you feel you would like to make a date with her. If you do not really know her, but have seen her in school, or with other friends, then it might take a little more effort, but it certainly can be done. Give her a compliment. Talk with her about your similarities and differences. Once you feel comfortable about it, do it. It will probably work.       1. Make sure you are up for it, and you don't want to give her any false ideas. Look somewhat decent, showing that you are trying. Don't show up wearing over-powering cologne; one squirt is enough. Just enough for her to notice you when talking to you but not for somebody across the room to notice. Also make sure you are not nervous. Girls hate that and you may get rejected.     2. Greet her in! Mundane activities like grocery shopping or more exhilarating ones like snowboarding are great ways for her to get to know you, although inviting her for having coffee at a Cafe is not only a great idea, but traditional as well. After you and she have had the opportunity to "feel" each other out, find a time in the conversation where it would be appropriate to ask her out. The way you would ask her is quite simple in fact. An example would be: "Hey I'm going/doing ACTIVITY this weekend. How would you like to tag along? I promise it'll be fun." Say this with a small smile, teasingly. Do NOT use cheesy pickup lines (e.g., So, what's your phone number."), as they are not you and you will likely get rejected. The example doesn't have to be followed verbatim, you can ask it in whatever way you feel is comfortable, but the important part is that you make a time to see her, and ask if she wants to come with you.     3. Spend time with her and a group of other people (not a one-on-one date). This will make her feel more comfortable as it's not as intense as being out as a couple.     4. If she is a good friend of yours, don't make her feel uncomfortable, but ask her out & tell her that you really like her.     5. Ask her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. Also, make sure the girl you are asking out is genuine and will really like you - not just because she has a good figure or is popular.     6. When asking her out, be careful about the term "girlfriend" or "boyfriend." Some girls believe this to be a much more serious relationship than just going out, and might reject you even if they would have agreed to just date you.            * Important! When you ask her out always show confidence. (Put yourself in her shoes -- how would you feel if a guy was shaking, sweating, and never looking you in the eyes? It would be really awkward!)            * Although some girls like it when you show that you are shy so ask and look down a little bit and then look up and smile. And tell her how you really feel.
CPGMIcEoaa	Show interest first! make eye contact and smile.     I like it when guys show interest more in me then my body. Talk with whatever girl you are especially interested in and learn about her interests. Remeber the small details! incase you want to make or get her something thoughtful.     Flowers never fail. If this chica shows interest give her some flowers with a thoughful card. I personally love it when a guy is a gentleman and opens the doors. I also like it when he fancies me and takes me out to a nice fancy dinner once in a while. It gives me a chance to really dress up for my man!      As far as what country has the best girls, I heard mexico and brazil from many guys.     Many latinas like white guys if they show interest and are truly  inlove with them. If not, they stick with their own latino men.  Good luck!|`|rmIeWCMjaa	I don't know where these other girls are from but I'm half latina and I've dated a couple of white guys to me it doesn't matter as long as he treats me right. My mom, aunt and many members of my family have married white guys. Speaking spanish helps.|`|y6BvpRtyaa	I'm Latina. They don't like white guys. I'm attracted to white guys. IDK why!! It's weird.|`|ZWSS8eRfaa	Mexico has the best girls!    Latinas are very passionate, get ready for some intense relationshippy stuff including the mushy talk. Definitely learn a bit of Spanish so you can keep up with her family. Learn to dance the way they do, because sooner or later you'll have to go to her cousin's wedding or something and wont want to look stupid!    They like outgoing men who are fun-loving, laid back, and maybe a bit guido-like; that's why you see Latinas mostly with other Latin men and sometimes middle easterns and southern europeans. No offense, but when they see some pasty american kid with irish/english/german ancestry, they'll tend to pre-judge him as boring.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	They normally don't go for white guys..so good luck.|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	I'm a white guy and I've had a couple.  If your really into it relocate.  You might have to go third world, but in the right country you could become a god, if you don't get killed first. Panama has got my vote for the finest latina women.|`|as8MVHbxaa	Just come out West, they are all over the place. No need to go to Mexico, they are all here.
n4oOFWGEaa	Take risks and live life girl. I have also gone through severe depression myself. Don't let one incident in your life control you. I know that had to be a traumatizing event in your life, but definitely give him a chance. This guy has seen your face and you have told him that you have gained weight. He wants to meet you and these were your two biggest concerns. However, do not make these your concerns. I know plenty of bigger girls who love their curves and have guys that love them for it and have more fun than half the twigs (what they call them) I know. Stop hating yourself. If you really hate something hate the fat and take steps to get rid of it. Go on a steady diet and start taking steps in exercising. We are put on Earth to live our lives and enjoy it, don't take that away from yourself. :-)|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	If you do not meet with him, even though you feel bad about yourself, you will regret it.  You will always wonder, "What would have happened?"  You told him about the car accident and the weight and the depression, but he said he doesn't care.  So now you need to meet face to face and see if it's true.  Big girls need love, too, and they've got a lot of love to give.  This might be just what you need to help you out of your depression.  I've lost weight nearly every time I fell in love--maybe you will, too!  You say the weight is stopping you from living.  Fight back your fears and don't let it stop you from doing this.  Not all men care whether or not you're slim and perfect.|`|96jsEQ3Zaa	If he really loves you he will take you into his arms. Relax you will be fine and you can do something about the weight. I was self conscious about my weight but exercise is the key. Good luck|`|cl1pJK38aa	I. Am. So. Sorry.    That is so terrible and I'm sorry that it happened to you.  You should meet him, just the way that you are.  If he loves you still, then he is exactly the type of person that you need/want to be with.  You can lose the weight anytime.      Take care.|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	If he loves you, he won't mind.    I'm sorry. Is the weight permanent?|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Go meet him with no expectations, and what ever happens happens!! Don't put pressure on yourself, be confident in who you are as a person and everything else will unravel that way it will!! Things may have changed with you physically but your still the same person inside and that is the most important thing!! People who only look for the perfect outside are very superficial and not worth the time of day, because as you know things happen and people can change, but the heart does not!! Love yourself and know that your just as worthy as the next person, a man loves a woman who is confident and not down on herself, so look in the mirror girl and love that woman you see because she is worth every bit of happiness she can have!! And by the way im a girl who has struggled with her weight all her life, but i find taking 30min power walks a day really helps me feel better physically and mentally, so try it!! Good luck to you!!|`|Dn8xd0Kuaa	don't feel about yourself, you are who you are and he will have to accept you for who you are and if he doesn't then you definitely do not need him by you because he's supposed to care for who you are from within . love yourself so that others can love you . good luck to you.|`|Ktg9mB3faa	well if you really feel bad about the way you look try working out a bit just enough so you loose a little body fat that will make you look a lot better  if you meet him and he loves you he will not leave you   you could both start to go for walks or runs so he can help you loose some weight  work together don't be scared to see him though

86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Your husband won't be earning the greatest salary to start with.  But in the end, if he does well and gets promoted it will certainly pay.  The army provides great bonding for our men at arms and socially looks after it's families.  If you love each other you should marry soon as everything works better in the army for a married couple.|`|AA11567932	Army pay is not brilliant but if you are in married quarters living together then I think they pay the rent out of his wages, as for anythig else, Child tax credit and working tax credit he will be entitled to if his earnings are low. Look into it    Go onto their website it should tell you all you need to know.    www.hrmc.co.uk      Hope it all works out|`|tFfUMQtyaa	But...What are you going to do when you "Want some" and he is away on leave for 6 Months.|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	i was an army wife for 16 years, its a good life as long as you can cope with them being away (sometimes to war) a lot. you get a home which you pay rent and normal bills for, they will even supply furniture, although it isn`t nice, a lot of people use it till they get their own sorted, you will usually move every couple or 3 years. there is plenty of support moral or otherwise in the form of, wives club, family's officer and s.a.f.f.a,all the wives husbands have the army in common so whilst your abroad they all know each other, there are lots of social occasions, and as long as your not the type to whine every time he has to go away or attend compulsory functions, it can be a good life. good luck.........dennis B you idiot when their on leave it means their on holiday lol|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Hi hun.  When I first met my boyfriend he was in the army about 200 miles away from me but we didn't live together then or have kids.  I should imagine it will be hard but you will adjust.  Get married first before your boyfriend goes to the army.  I was looking for info on living with your husband on his campus but couldn't find anything suitable that matched your question.   Lots of army men marry their girlfriends and have their own place near to the army base, but I'm not sure about a wife that isn't in the army.  Hmm this isn't a very good answer sorry! but if you are prepared to move then definitely look into living with him as an army wife  Good luck with everything.|`|cZhmXUnVaa	If you love this man you will cope  my daughter is a military wife living in usa shes aussie shes been in usa 9 years now she loves her husband and has 3 children  they have been deployed a few months again yes they cope on there money very well.  she loves him do you think your strong enough i hope so everyone needs someone to love life is not good with out a partner i can asure you that be grateful you have a child and a man with a good job.|`|taQFWXuHaa	Well, Im married to a US Marine. IDK how british military pays or works but His pay is decent now great we get military housing and well he has a slight chance of getting deployed to a war zone any time so as long as you love your partner and you teach you son that his daddy is off being a hero you guys will be just fine!!  just try to support him in any way possible love him and charish everything he does for you bc at the end of the day when he gets off from work all he will want to do is be with you and with your son...Good luck!!!!|`|9f8XoDKJaa	There are many pluses and minuses    Minuses     He could die or be injured.  You probably wont see him much a year and relationship with son will be odd. Statistics prove that a variety of problems occur such as domestic violence.  and many more    Pluses.  Financially you will probably be ok.  Plenty of help and facilities for about everything.  Plenty of support from other people and wives which is the best you will see.    My experience was ( Being the one in the Army)  My daughter needed surgery all the time and was taken care of by excellent care (United states army though)  I was Away all the time out in field or out in another country.    Wife got lazy and was probably having affairs ( yet to be proven) But not Ex wife.     And thats just chapter 1

AA10418744	I CAN ATTEST TO THAT. I REALLY HATE TO LOVE THIS GUY. I KNOW HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR QUITE LONG ENOUGH.  wE WENT OUT SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR EACH OTHER IN TIMES OF TROUBLE. HIS FAMILY KNOWS ME, MY FAMILY KNOWS HIM AND BOTH OUR FAMILIES THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN US. ONE DAY, I ASKED HIM WHY HE WAS SO THOUGHTFUL AND SWEET TO ME. I EVEN ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE REAL SCORE BETWEEN US. HE SAID HE LIKED ME BUT NOT READY FOR ANY SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP YET. I WAS HURT!!!! AFTER A FEW MONTHS, I FOUND OUT THAT HE GOT A COLLEGE GIRL PREGNANT!!! WHAT? HE SAID HE WASN'T READY? MY GOSH... WHAT I DID WAS I AVOIDED HIM AND NEVER GOT IN TOUCH WITH HIM AGAIN. EVEN IF HE SENDS ME MESSAGES AND CALLS ME.... THOSE GUYS ARE CRAP!! THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A WOMAN'S WORTH IS...|`|WMqYhDNMaa	Then move on. You are making yourself miserable.   Your age does matter, cos you should be able to maturely handle this. Sex doesn't mean relationship.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	it feels much worse to be abandoned then smothered. but personally i wouldn't like either.|`|hBSh8Y1haa	Abandonment  - because it would make me believe I wasn't really important to him.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Smothered. I am the worst kind of dude because when I want someone to be around then I can't get enough of them and then there are times when I am like... Could you just leave me the F alone for a day or two... I struggle with this because I have a great and loving wife and if she could figure out a way to be conjoined I think she would elect to have the surgery. I love her to  death but I have always been a loner and it takes work for me to let her in... I have gotten better after 10 years of marriage, but I still suck.|`|FnTV0Htvaa	think of it this way!! abandonment makes you feel lonely and worse knowing that the person your wit left you for someone else! that would make me feel so much worse    now smothered may seem bad but at least you have someone that cares and loves you enough to be there for you when you have NO ONE ELSE(abandonment)!    but its up to you i guess i can see why smothered would seem irritating but at least that person has someone|`|agTCqkLDaa	I've definitely been in both.  I have a really good balance though I wouldn't mind a *little* more time with him but he is a dedicated worker.  It is a hard choice-I think I'd feel worse in the abandoned relationship though because at least in a smothered relationship you know your partner wants to be with you...of course it can get irritating at times...all of the clinging.|`|nOUKkS8Faa	Wow, interesting question. From my personal experience I definitely have abandonment issues. My wife just got a new job, travels a lot and often goes on about it non stop when she is at home.    On the other hand, I've never felt smothered, so it's hard to compare.
3mb5IV1Zaa	If you think she's acting shady, then don't GIVE her a reason to talk to him. Find a new friend to confide in. Also, be open and honest if you expect your relationship to last. If you're upset about something, let him know. Most men aren't mind readers.... And they (in general) have less innate ability to decipher non-verbals without training than women. That's usually where communications problems come from. A woman thinks,   "Why doesn't he get it. I would totally get that before someone even said it." But guys just hear the words.|`|MczmTftTaa	don't assume, it just makes an... you get it.|`|WFxVuM1Laa	first of all if somethings on your mind get it out, my girl does that to me all the time, mad but says nothing wrong, cant fix it without knowing about it. Second if you realy like this guy you need to TRUST him. If he betrays your trust then its not your fault and find a better man.|`|3jUHw9yWaa	well i wouldn't tell this girl anything. she may have just been trying to help. just ask her if she said something to him. and if she says yes then i would immediately look at your boyfriend...why didnt he tell you the truth?    and as  weird as this may seem, he might have actually picked up on the signals...    but just ask her and stop telling her things...girls either run there mouths on purpose or do it because they think they are helping.
2mqrbxN1aa	When i was 3 i had a boyfriend, we used to play together in our garden. I knew him until i was 10. He was the most special, sweetest boy i had ever met. he died aged 23 on the ice at a lake.  I had not seen him for 13 years. I was amazed how much that affected me. it was in the newspapers. I did not go to the funeral and i now wished i had.  Go tomorrow and pay your respects, have a good cry and realise that you have wonderful memories of him.  All the best x|`|2TC7aS8Baa	go pay your respects there is nothing wrong with that|`|iNyJm0Vbaa	oh, wow. i think you should go anyway though. he was your friend right?|`|M8x2btaIaa	I think you should go see him for the last time to send him off. Being in denial will cause you to have regrets that you can never change if you miss the funeral. The times that you both spent together will never come back.
HCMrR1O9aa	if she's your friend, she'll respect your boundary's...you just have to let her know, and most of the time (i have alot of gay friends) its NOT sex or anything of the sort that thier after...their just normal poeple lookin for the same things you are...friends and possibly someone to date, but everyone usually knows the other persons boundary's....my gay friends, i have no problem huggin me or givin me a kiss hello on the cheek, because i let my straight friends do it..dont think of her as a lesbian...think of her as your friend, because then, you wont be the one makin it uncomfy ok? hope i helped....and yes you should go over to her house...lesbians give some of THE best fashion advise....lol..|`|6GUpUXoXaa	why would you be afraid?  if your just going to her house as a friend then what is stopping you?  why are you friends with her in the first place?    if you are just friends with her then be her friend don't treat her like she's a disease... she's your friend    **If your uncomfortable then don't if your not sure but you're leaning towards going over then go over and see what happens if you become uncomfortable tell her that you can't and she should understand if she really is your friend|`|PFGo7nFXaa	you said well 3 times|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Are you afraid she may want to kiss you or have sex with you?

There are people out there who looks down upon such relationships and some close family or friends who will violently object to this. If you think it carefully over and feel that you can bear the consequences for a relationship that you don't know whether will last or not then act upon your decision. There is no right or wrong in your choice, just how you handle the balance.  No matter what you decide, stand strong and stay supported with your friends that will stand by you no matter what, ok?
rqNb6FIraa	Maybe your girlfriend revealed an intimmit detail to them and now when they see you they immediately think about it. Talk to your girlfriend and ask her about it.|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	maybe it's your personality, that comes first to looks.
IbtQ5IKNaa	Very odd you would get yourself into that situation since it was only somewhat of a relationship with this and that back there and now and maybe ahead.    Whatever your problem was, is your problem, and if you are missing something then you should have remembered it when it was around.
elhcuN19aa	A day of sleeping in and movies and pizza  but that is me|`|njFK5FISaa	Lots of love and good food cooked by only her.
JV445FR9aa	A nice dinner out.... or a cute little date... something we don't go and do everyday... or maybe a nice relaxing massage... something cute that just says I love you!|`|oHV95EFLaa	Just a day alone away from our kids so we can have a quiet peaceful conversation. Valentines day is our wedding anniversary so i would hope he would plan something big|`|86cbe4dd178cb02db522c4731c3db240aa	Dinner at a Pool side restaurant.. just the two of us. Water is an aphrodisiacal element|`|kjOsSmM0aa	My husband is not very romantic and we are having problems in our marriage right now, but if he were to still plan something, I think it would be most romantic to clean my house and cook me a yummy meal (with the kids at the babysitters, of course) and just spend the whole evening together, talking about anything and everything. I love for things to be out in the open and to know that he cares about us as a couple, not just me as a mom.|`|lJw9hjKTaa	gather what makes your wife happy,if you have kids ask them .children know what mothers want by maybe she mentioned what she wanted.2.please switch your phone off on that day in front of her and tel her today is your day no friends and no work.take her to dinner something different and sex.  just what she likes and that you don't like.and later at home surprise her  with a present something small  but fancy and please make love to her not her making love to you.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	A nice dinner at a fancy restaurant and then go home and make love.    I dont need any flowers or any other gifts because having a nice night out and making love with him is more then enough for me.
iKDhHNX2aa	Translation:   "I've had too much to drink".|`|5jYBKmz6aa	she wants you
XLXncQu9aa	I would respect her wishes, and that would make me feel good because it says she has high standards like I do.  I feel that sex is a gift given by God for those that want to marry.  Some wait and some don't, but I feel it is better when you do wait because it not only makes it easier on the couple, but it makes things more exciting in the relationship.  If a woman wants to wait until she is married, that is a great thing.  It says she has a standard she wants to uphold, and she has self-respect, and it says she doesn't just want to give it away without some sort of commitment.  I think its a great idea.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Men ought to respect that in a girl it means she has morals and would not cheat.|`|5e3b1qWzaa	then respect that!|`|3lKAR9G2aa	I stayed with a girl for 4 years without doing it because I respected her.  If you feel strongly about this, don't you dare settle for less.|`|yOTSC7Vxaa	You know what the answer is going to be already lol. If you are dedicated to pursuing something stable and long term with her, you would respect her decision until she's ready.|`|BeSteUwwaa	I had a girl tell me the same thing too before.  In fact I use to have that same mentality.. until I started getting curious about sex.    Here is what ended up happening for me... my gf and I took the bases really slow..talked about things thoroughly... like what if this..what if that...how will we handle it..and when the right time came..it happened.    Either that or just respect her wishes... trust me, you'll feel 100000 times as worse if something ends up happening and she is in the phase of regret.. would you want that burden on your shoulders? exactly..so respect it and take things slow.     U know what they say...save the best for last.|`|ad8cd03cf96d5d4c04b0bea21c1cd771aa	Well, if you REALLY liked her you would pursue her, regardless, and respect her wishes to stay a virgin. Respect is just as important as any other thing in a relationship.
cl1pJK38aa	maybe you could show me some pictures of your *****... errr... i mean cat.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	be like can i see yours next lol|`|sQYsMbQyaa	"maybe next time i will show u apicture f something else...if u know what i mean *wink*  wink *|`|WhnZ9tPRaa	lol, love the first answer, it's perfect. It's not to obvious that your hinting at something perverted but it works nicely.
Z2isnS2Raa	it doesn't matter to me    if they like to cook - great, I appreciate it!  If they are to stressed by their work or are sick of cooking, then that's okay as well!|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	No. Just like if you were a  maid, would you be the one to do all the cleaning. If he want to - great. But  because that is his profession, he may appreciate someone cooking for him.   M|`|AA10442322	Most chefs I know prefer not to cook at home. They have enough stress at work. They would rather have the wives to do the cooking. All chefs say they enjoy nothing more than the cooking of their wives.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	I don't know anyone that would want to come home everyday to do what they do at work everyday. It's not too much to ask that they make a few special meals now and then but to expect it everyday would be a little much.|`|nSsIGlF1aa	i say cook together if possible OR whoever is available to cook at dinner time the chef or the spouse whoever is there!|`|Wy47JwOQaa	Not all the time, but on special occasions at the very least.  Its his/her job so I can understand that they wouldn't want to do it alot when they got home.  That being said, if he/she prefers to cook at home and enjoys it, well rock on!  Do it.|`|AA11286626	If you are both working, then you can take turns cooking, if not, You should volunteer to cook.|`|d7dd462aaca2f3f6864eb52dbf7754d7aa	I became a chef because I wanted to be this great cook for my boyfriend who is now my husband.  After 12 years in the biz I still love to cook for him but I just can't do it after a long stint of really grueling days at work. I would say he cooks about half of the time for us and I almost always cook on my days off.  I try out out all my new dishes on him, and if he doesn't like it, I usually change it or scrap the idea.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I think you could take turns cooking to give the chef a break once in awhile.|`|XTBlOf9baa	My friend is engaged to a chef. He doesn't like to do the daily cooking at home, but he still nitpicks my friend whenever she cooks for him. So she'll cook, but basically he'll tell her what to do the entire time, or complain because the meal's not up to his standards. It makes me glad I didn't marry a chef! Haha.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I have a friend that is a chef and the last thing he wants to do when he comes home is cook. His wife does the cooking.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Cook together|`|K8OjmMUAaa	LOL of course not. I wouldn't want to come home from work and do the exact same thing I just spend the last 8 hours slaving over, I wouldn't put my husband through that! If he were a chef I'd do the cooking.
xHKRGEg4aa	Maybe he just wanted to stay out a little later because he is de-stressing & chilling with the guys. stay up a little later, have your music playing & still be all nice & dressed up for him.  If he says "i'm too tired" then tell him you've been waiting for two hours & wanted to show him you were sorry but if hes going to be a jerk, you'll remember to dress like a nun from now on.  good luck! |`|pKzH1cFHaa	No, I don't think you are overreacting, but I don't think you should make a big deal out of it. Perhaps he just needed to get away and have some time away from you because of all of the fighting. If you feel like it, stay up late and wait up for him and have your little wink wink.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I think you are being a little selfish.  If your normal bedtime was 9:00 and you had to call him at 10:30 to find out he wasn't coming home until midnight, you'd be ok.  But he's not staying out late if the normal bedtime is midnight; he's following your request to not stay out late.    Unless you verbalize "please come home before bedtime so we can spend some time together" and then give a specific time you'd like for him to be home, it's not right to get mad at him for staying out until his normal time.    Let this one go.  Crawl into bed and when he gets there, spoon him.  It's not lingerie, but it's still intimate.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	You can't hold it against him. If you guys haven't been getting along all that well lately you can't expect him to call and check up. Plus, even if he did come home at midnight, if you had this little pleasent surprise planned out, why not wait up and still give it to him. I mean just because he normally goes to bed at midnight doesnt mean that he cant stay up a little later to have some fun with the woman he loves. Specially if it is make up sex. After all that is some of the best kind.|`|RoicHy87aa	i don't think this is wrong to get upset about. but maybe he just needs some time to do his own thing. a phone call would have been nice, but he is just out having fun with his friends and blowing off some steam. when you let them out they always come back. also maybe more time apart will help you not fight so much. don't get on his case when he comes home. maybe finding you all dressed up will make him realize what he left behind when he went out instead of staying home with you.    just breathe, relax, and don't worry.|`|l6EO5pDDaa	maybe he's just having some fun. let him be a boy. lol.  stay dressed up and if he comes home just tell him you wanted to surprise him earlier but he decided to stay out later so you are too tired now to do anything. be sweet about it though not angry. then lay in bed and ask him how his day with the boys was. it shows you are ok with the fact that he went and had fun with his friends. and ask him to plan a day ahead of time so you guys can just be together to make up for the night you missed. laugh and cuddle with him before you fall asleep... easy any tension and you guys will be all right... =)    best wishes...
QQbtCLAkaa	I think guys just like to flirt with cute girls.  it's like an instinct, even if we're not interested in dating.
C3yE261uaa	I can't understand s.th here why did you invit him if you didn't want him there??!!|`|A2u06IS1aa	He probably really still cares for you. He just brung his gf to see whether or not you would be jealous. Dropped her off so that she wont get mad at him. And took care of you because he still loves you. That should be a good thing. Facing his fears for you. I mean seriously, scared that he might get beat up, but still come for you? Dang thats soo sweet.(: he probably still has feelings for you in return. He thinks you have feelings for him.|`|VIDh3oUVaa	wow he sounds like... he cares about u more than he should mmm thats all i have to say =)|`|cf6BdTYUaa	you weren't very nice to him were you... he still likes you|`|AA10234242	he still cares about you|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	he probrably touched you somewhere when you were drunk.    he is your ex, if he didnt break up with YOU then it means he still has feelings for you.    so he stayed back to help you, he knows that your drunk and it is influencing you to do stupid stuff, i mean if you were your normal self, you wouldnt strip or blurt out unneccecary stuff.    sorry to say, but you were a real ***** to him that night, i suggest you make it up with him by giving a kiss or another date.|`|2eCmyfH2aa	a|`|NJrsrT12aa	obviously he still loves you, but isn't IN love i guess...if he has a girlfriend.    i don't know how the two of you broke up in the first place, but maybe he does still love you then and is looking for an oppurtunity to leave his gf for you if you guys can reignite an old flame.    if you're still interested in him, talk to him more and see what comes out of it. you never know, you might be back with him someday.|`|1id6XTOBaa	drunk = emotion-ly|`|F0pbcvPgaa	maybe he cares for you and he regret the fact that he hurt you|`|1QURArm3aa	I would say he still has feelings for ya.|`|neJbYkJoaa	Sounds like he cares for you a lot.  I don't think you should drink anymore.  It will only complicate matters and end up causing you a lot of hurt in your life.  Go to an AA meeting if you can't stop.  Maybe, if you still love your ex, you could get back together, but I think the alcohol will only interferr with things getting better, even if you don't get back together.  It will age you fast and make you less pretty and youthful and hurt your brain cells.    Also, you should never cause any physical harm to anyone.  It's hard to believe that your ex would be so nice when you were so mean to him.  Lay off of the alcohol and see what happens.|`|MfOjOIhraa	he still likes... his girlfriend probably was jealous so she said he could go if she did so that's what he did..... he cares about you.    he could have left you drunk but he didn't|`|024yRfqtaa	first of all u can still have alot of feeling for an ex even from 2 years ago, i know from experience. and from what i can tell from this he does still have feeling for u, talk to him bout wht he did all taht and if he does still have feelings fir u and who knows maby yall will get back together|`|UEDUvVxaaa	Sounds like you're a B****|`|iJx16YqRaa	What do you mean why? You know why, c'mon.|`|fUBhCh7Kaa	he is still in love with you and wants you back most likely.|`|u72QPS8jaa	maybe your better than his present girlfriend and he misses you  he may still have feelings for you. one things for sure he cares for you.but sometimes people care for special people in their life even though they are not lovers   he may just be a caring person so dont think to deep into it. i may get hurt again!|`|AA10179574	he still loves you.  if you were being mean to me, and i was being so nice to you, i would have been pissed and just left.|`|f8fcf69035b5bbf5d35f80da1b5df007aa	my opinion he might still like you, he feels bad for the past and felt like he owed it to you, or he remembers the old times and still sees that inside you despite your mean words.    can be anyone of those.|`|aXRSlnWvaa	aww...   well... I don't know him (obviously)  but it seems he is a good person who cares about you even though you two aren't together anymore.     he either has moved on and knows you are a good person who he wouldn't like to see get hurt on her own birthday (or at all) because she drank too much, or he could have just never moved on and still like you (unlikely, but possible, since he has a girlfriend.. are they close?)     He's brave to have handled all of that.. cousins, fear, a drunk person who dosen't like him.. trust me, that kind of stuff is hard.     Drunkenness brings out the very worst in people..|`|kMpgMplmaa	Because alot of time with x's there are still feelings behind and they become like a lifelong friend forever better than anyone. If you think about it, you really opened up to this person and vice versa, so you  guys have a unbreakable bond depending on how you broke up. Me and most of my x's are the best of friends, and i would do anything for them
AA10142515	Oh wow, Stacie, there are so many signs, I can't even think of where to start. I know when I lost all respect and love for my ex-husband, I would not allow him to touch me. When he did I would cringe or my spine would stiffen. I would actually ask him, "Must you paw me?" when he would touch me for any reason. That is all I can think of at the moment. But there are many, many signs.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	1) Indifference. They don't care if they see that person or not.  2) No talk of the future plans. Not necessarily marriage, just plans.  3) Interest in other people  4) New Friends  5) Secrecy with cell phone  6) Being busy so they don't have to be with that boyfriend or girlfriend.  7) If you think they aren't in love, you are probably right.|`|mggll8dRaa	They are rarely around....!!|`|71ae4755ec6533f862aed7b1761c0dccaa	Patting you on the back while hugging  Acting distant  Consistently not listening to you  Always busy doing something that doesn't include you  And most of all - whatever your instincts tell you!|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	Being distant.

Independence...too much independence, likes doing a lot of things without you.  Interested in other things and not valuing your opinions or even asking for them.  There's actually quite a lot, but if you're asking yourself if your SO loves you or not, that's a sign that there may be a problem that both of you have to resolve together.|`|wzqahEqiaa	If they are looking dreamy eyed at other people.

I'd continue, but i'm tapped out. *sighs* so tired.  xoxo  ?
CqpK9LC1aa	Get off your butt and DO SOMETHING about it!!     If you care about this person more than as a friend, stop him, talk to him, tell him about your feelings.     Even if he's keeping to himself, that shouldn't be something that would stop you from seeing him.     So be proactive about it before it's too late!|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL, BEFORE YOU REGRET IT!!!!!!!!|`|S4gKPOBOaa	there are lots of fish in the sea dont worry about it.|`|024yRfqtaa	u have to confront him about it and find out if its ture or not because u normaly cant trust the third party, and second u have to go and tell him how u feel because if you dont and he does leave u will regret never telling him|`|EMYlCPfuaa	firstly you should go see him and ask him if hes moving. either iether way, let him know how you feel about him and make arangements for communication and/or visistations. you know weekends? just talk with him and see waht happens|`|axogVBmCaa	Hi    Please get him, life's to short to miss out on this.

Cpp1LddVaa	My wife and I are 15 years apart and we are about to celebrate our 15th anniversary of when we first met (our wedding anniversaries trail a year behind).    IMHO, the key to success with an age difference is that you approach the relationship as two consenting adults with two individual -- and equally valid -- sets of adult life experiences.  You're not his daughter and he's not your dad, although it's no sin if he can help you with your homework and you can help him remember where he misplaces things.    He needs to be willing to try new things and not be overly "set in his ways."    The main thing is to willingly talk about how you feel and stay on top of little things like saying "I love you" to each other every day.    A big part of the fun of our relationship is that no one can "figure us out."      Good luck and best wishes.|`|PG8c9ZL0aa	When you were born he was older than what you are right now! Just something to think about.|`|mY4m47WTaa	One of my best friends got involved with a woman who was the older lady. He was 18 and it she was about that age of your guy. They ended up living together for a few years. The sex was great, he was in love with her, but when she was in her mid-40s and he was in his mid-20s, it started to unravel. He basically grew up (which you do when you are in your mid-20s). He says now that he decided to stay and stay, but it only prolonged the pain. It ended sadly, and he wasted some prime years of his life.    He included her in things that he did with guys his age, but she was always like the elephant in the room no one talked about. She was old enough to be his mother and he is old enough to be your father. If you are looking for a fling and companionship, then that is that. If you are looking for the future, then this is not for you. Eventually, he will be a very obviously old man and you will still be young and virile. I won't say that you won't be able to make it work, but consider not wasting life. He's already lived his (the adult half of your life that you haven't even lived yet), so he won't be wasting it.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Let lovers love    As long as its not illegal  and last time I checked 18 was legal  even tho its going to be awkward to a LOT of people, it will also be understood by people    So really, if thats what makes you happy, than go for it  Look at it as not havin an age.. Idk
6GUpUXoXaa	Have you done anything with him?  Like did you and him kiss or anything when you were with other people?  if so then if you knew what he was doing with you when he was dating someone else then that might play a huge part if you do get together.    If not then no I don't see the age thing as a big deal.  Personally I wouldn't do it but I don't frown upon it whatever makes you happy makes you happy.    Now if you plan on dating him when he's ready for a realtionship do yourself and the person that you are seeing a favor and don't waste his time while you are waiting for someone else because that really wouldn't be fair    good luck!|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Sorry, but its too much of a difference. Lets say somehow it is true love, theres gonna be problems in 10 years.   It wont last, even if you thought he was your soul mate.  Don't do it, it may even alienate your friends and family or at least put funny thoughts into thier heads.|`|fKxW31U6aa	well it is a large difference but my one question is have u ever met this man . cause if u haven't then i don't think it would be a good idea to talk to him cause u don't really know if he is a "nice"person if you know what i'm saying. im not trying to be rude but seriously be careful with talking to people on the internet.|`|u72QPS8jaa	Hi there  I am around your age level aswel and have experienced something similar to you. The man that was interested in me was in his 30's. I must say my friends and family were not too happy about it and just told me to be careful but if it made me happy do what your heart tells you to do.  At the end of the day its your life and you should do whatever makes you happy. Im sure there is a little voice inside of you telling you to do something! follow it coz in the end thats all that matters    goodluck & takecare|`|SqNkiDmBaa	honestly its a big difference but who cares u dont need to care about society to date a man its what u think about this remember that and do what u think is best :)|`|l9MPAp4xaa	I wouldn't care about the age difference coz of society as much as the difference in your guys thinking and experience. I truly hope he is the guy that you are looking for and is not faking it. You're 18 and usually at that age we tend to think we know everything but we don't. My only concern would be you getting hurt as he is twice your age and might not be serious; other than that, its all good.|`|oYYblXFmaa	Sorry to say this, but the age is far beyond. If this man is very responsible, smart, funny etc. there is no right or wrong to make your own decision. You just follow your heart tells you. If you sure have a touch of interest of him...... why not just go ahead. The important is as long you are happy what you are doing, then take the chance. If you don't care about the age or don't care what people think about you guys.....then what the point to worry about. Remember it's your life....nobody can't tell you what to do. Good luck you two!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Its a big age gap, & a psychologist would say you have father && stability issues. But personally I think if he really makes you happy, go for it. you only get a few true shots at happiness.  |`|uXQcDsiAaa	i personally think u should date a person that u enjoy being with.   when the age thing comes in, it's confusing.  i mean, u were born when he was 19 years old!!!! it's a big deal for me, but if you really like him. THEN DATE HIM|`|AA11618542	It's not necessarily wrong to date someone who's older than you, even by a few decades. You just have to prep yourself: because a lot of people are probably going to frown upon your relationship with him. But as long as you don't let it affect your relationship, then there's nothing wrong with dating him.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	I would think he was a lucky man , and if you two really love each other unconditionally , then who cares what others think . You two are the only ones who truly know if you belong together  so go for it when and if he gets ready .|`|JmMrgtGqaa	The age difference is not necessarily a bad thing right now I think it's fine for people of diff ages to date. The only negative thing is when he grow eldery, For ex. when he's 70, youl be 51. That could put a major burden on you quality of life. Instead of enjoying the beginning of your retirment years, you could be stuck taking care of him. If you still think it would be worth this, then go for it!|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	that's not a big deal. just be sure he is ready to date and youre not just a rebound girl.
4NKoOPIMaa	girl you'll eventually be alright. i know its tough what your going through and it'll be like that. but to me it just seems like he's using you. i know it doesn't sound like a good idea but your hurt and you shouldn't let him your life if he's not even sure if he wants you in his. guys like that aren't worth plus never ever put your world around a guy cause it can come crashing down. let him suffer with that girl he's with cause karma is a b*t*h. i think you should just let him go. it may take awhile but it best for you. if not you'll be feeling that way forever..good luck sweetie|`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	Never build your life around a man.  None will ever live up to your expectations.      This guy sounds like a loser.  He likes her because she is taking care of herself and her children (all three of them including him).  He can continue to be a child and not accept grown up responsibility and most likely still get laid.  I would take this as a godsend and stay away from this guy.  Forget the memories and move forward.  There are lots of new adventures out there.  Go find one.  It won't be hard to replace that man with one who really wants a commitment.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	How about learn to date MEN, not Boys, then we can talk|`|ql0RmOLiaa	listen to jason mraz details in the fabric    im serious      like for real|`|YJjcqoUKaa	im not sure that i'll be that much help but i'll try    don't ever think that it is stupid for missing him  you were with him for a very long time and you guys almost got married.    and if you guys are still talking and he's telling you still that he is having doubts it can be a good thing or a bad thing.    the good thing is, is that maybe it will get to him missing you and everything and want you back because he realizes he messed up.    but on the other hand it could be bad because maybe he is just telling you all of that stuff to string you along so that if him and his new gf have a problem he can come running to you  and then when him and his gf fix things he'll just leave again and if he ends up doing this once then he'll think that he could do it again.    and see he is hiding the fact that he hung out with you  when guys do that it means that they still have feeling for you and if he would have told his gf then she would have prolly asked tons of questions and he didn't want to deal with it.    i hope that i helped atleast a little bit.|`|6a2d4956b1f65de4776e108cc2824911aa	My fiance broke up with me the week before Thanksgiving.  I did everything for her, but we had problems in the relationship that I failed to realize until it was too late.  I spent months trying to do things to get back together but with no luck.  Finally, I stopped trying and started to live my life.  I took a look at the relationship and realized that it was not worth it to try to make things better.      In short, there are reasons for a break-up.  If he care more about someone else to leave you for them, then he will never see you as the  1 person and you should just move on.  There are a lot better guys that will be better for you, it just takes time.|`|ae9db1fc2f90ba344bdcf7d6f5201771aa	The guys a dumb ***!  You need to find something to help take your mind off of him.  I'm not going to lie to you its probably going to be pretty hard but don't give up!
BPtnDLu3aa	Well, I really like my boyfriend's butt. :) It's pretty firm and somewhat round though you can't tell in jeans. Also, he has these cute little dimples above his butt cheeks that we call his "buttons." XD I think I play more with his butt than he does mine. lol It's so cuteee! So his butt is basically my ideal butt. :) Firm and somewhat round though not so big that you can tell he has a butt in jeans. Also, dimples above buttocks=hot. :D|`|8j0KDb27aa	Round and firm......nice butt!|`|ewixOpyFaa	i think so my gf always grabs it and oogles it more than i to her|`|aEonduUUaa	i love my own rofl|`|J14tPA9Eaa	mine     i would post a pic but.... naw|`|wE2etBzbaa	haha, if they see my hairy butt.  but I would be suspicious of a "girl" who find my butt likable,  as she might be a guy cross dressing|`|bxfInqBPaa	Gelatinous and grape flavoured.|`|7Icg8uKraa	Yes! It has to look delicious.
cLS3Jhz7aa	i think you must full sense of humor..and you must be a good looking guy...always be a stylish guy,don't be too romantic and try to be comfort with her...make her happy and give her something that she will use everyday...i think this can help you...i know all of this bcoz i'm a girl too
MomXGfc1aa	Sometimes we are unhappy because we don't have what we want. Take a moment and think about all the things you want, and the type of person you want to be. Know yourself and love yourself.     Then do things you love, or try to make the world a little better by joining a humanitarian organization, mentor someone, recycle, do something nice for someone else. I think it will make you happy and feel good about yourself at the same time.     If you have any dreams, figure out a way to make your dreams a reality. Every step is a step closer.|`|F0vnLoaIaa	look in a mirror an say to your self your amazingly awsome then go out an do something that proves u are !  go sky diving !!! =D !  or something awsome like that paint a big picture throw a party go stand on your roof an dont stop believing my jurney or take my breath away from top gun something like that that always feels just awsome =D
1TKfwDGsaa	Try asking him if he's going on the vacation with his girlfriend, or if he talks about something else, if his girlfriend is involved, etc.
EMYlCPfuaa	honey that sounds like he's single! what are you doing? if you like him, grab him! then again- who knows he maybe gay? and ging to maui to find another male? all gay guys ar really nice to girls cos they 'safe'! they into boys and tehy know the girls wont chase them.
xzX3NSUjaa	Ignore her. This works for many reasons: she starts missing you, she feels you don't miss her and might move on, she has no idea what you're doing and wants to know, she doesn't want to lose you,etc.|`|1QRLr6Caaa	I am sorry because I am very very weak in helping people in such situation.|`|TYxfUjqWaa	1. yes its for sure u guys r in love    2. no matter u fight or break up u cant stay away frm each other    3. analyse why u guys fight...whose fault is it anyways..sot those issues out    4. remember even if v hav to quit frm a relationship ..make sure u never quit on a bad note..make it ur policy for life...    5. give her time to missu ..to react...dnt stop writing poems ..bt gift them all to her when she comes to u ..and tells u that she loves u ...give her lil time ...i am sure she  wont b able to b away frm u for long    6. talk to her..take her out some where ..like where u met first..or had a supereb date..tell her ur feelings clearly..that u love her still so very much and would wait for her to come bak..( quit on a sweet gesture n note) ..tell her u will always b there but now she has to decide...    7. even if she fights...u keep ur cool and let no ego play a part...    8. i hav faced n facing somewhat same kind of situtation wid my love interest...telling u all this frm my experience  all the best|`|AbcnySYkaa	Ive been through something similar to this a few years back...

MX1shAbcaa	They just look for a girl that looks good tbh. its only highschool  ~William
RzeYy8dTaa	Yes but tell her why you are inviting him.He should not miss out ,they will have run ins and need to learn th deal with them.   Also let him know she will be there.|`|a984cQjKaa	it depends on why they broke up and how long ago it was.|`|jmo7CpiIaa	i think u should invite him
71VRvldJaa	If they weren't important to me?  Not a chance.....not even for free sex in a dorm room!  You must be desperate!|`|NuCu5RbTaa	i wouldn't to spend a night in a dorm room, but maybe a driving person is very desperate to get laid. and i wouldn't measure importance of a person by how many hours someone is willing to drive. u don't know how desperate a driving person might be|`|Cpr9rArVaa	yes i would i drive 2 hours to spend time with my boyfriend of two years and he drives 2 hours also. we take turns if i cant make it there he comes to me or if he cant make it i come to him if i can.
MX1shAbcaa	If you wanna do it .... go ahead.. Not very acceptable moral-wise  ~William|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	If the two of you determine it is acceptable then it is just that. Does society frown upon this type of thing, to some degree yes. The moral majority (for what it's worth) would say that the only acceptable sex is that with your married partner. I don't agree with that stance but that is my opinion. As long as the two of you are comfortable having sexual relations without having an actual relationship, by all means have at it. If either one of you develops feelings then the entire scenario changes. I assume the two of you are of age and are taking the necessary precautions to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. If so, enjoy.
Z3a1cRL7aa	It sounds like she is on the rebound, and doesn't want a relationship but wants to get some good loving from a guy she can trust.  It is my belief that she would be happy with a one night stand/friend with benefits scenario.  If you are okay with something like this, when she comes to your house and you go to bed, ask if she wants a back rub.  If she is thinking that she wants to do more than that she will accept and the night will progress.  If she has no other intentions, she will allow you to rub her back and say thank you and good night.  If she is seeking a relationship with you it will not likely work both because of the distance and the timing.  She wants some good friction.  Be sure to have a box of condoms on hand and some lube.  If nothing happens, at least you were prepared, and you can use the lube by yourself.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	be careful, you might be the rebound guy.  tell her distance isnt your thing, but friends is still nice.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	she is just really confused now and needs some comforting  so the best way she thinks of doing this is by hooking up|`|DTN6Vg8caa	see the internet , use it
GHZnLiYvaa	Well, it wasn't an official date. It's just that two of you were hanging out together as friends. However, if you wanna date her, ask her out, I'm sure she would say yes! Good luck! :)|`|5YFgZCEKaa	no it was not.  date is something when you plan it and dress accordingly  it was just ---good friends hanging together|`|59CaFeS8aa	Ymm    Its the beginning.    Take staright routes before exploring the jungle ways.|`|GckVXU4Paa	perhaps u can call it an indirect date. Since, u were just going for a pizza. And she was in a good mood to accompany u.    Next time, take her for a movie in the similar way.  All the Best.|`|8joH7GGzaa	may be its first step towards a date. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.|`|MQqlcBcFaa	Nope..it isn't. its called a date only when you like that person and want to know her or if you're just planning to go a step more.    It was just a casual hangout what you had.|`|l2nkHFfFaa	yes it is a indirect date u may call her again for a direct date my friend!
5YFgZCEKaa	he is enjoying ur msgs and if you have some self esteem then stop these.  your regular msgs are giving a boost to his ego...dont feed his ego if you wanna him to  respect u.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Sounds to me like he is doing this to irritate you, and get under your skin. Just dont send him anymore messages.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	If YOU want a response, stop sending him messages, it will get him to wondering (if he cares at all). If not, you've lost nothing have you?
ghz5D5iLaa	I have never had that happen to me. I think that I would want to kill him and it would get very ugly.|`|D0VC1FXqaa	i'm pretty sure it was my spouse who got us an std within the FIRST year of marriage after i hadn't had sex with anyone else in well over a year. but of course i went along with it like an idiot because it must have been something we just carried and never knew about it... or got it from a toilet seat... yeah, right. i went to leave to take a couple days to think about it, he pitched a fit i was leaving and physically kept me in our home and wouldn't me leave (even wrestled me to the ground and was on top of me) and then I finally left for a day or two and his crazy mother somehow talked me in to working it out but she was probably just protecting that peice of s h i t.... now I'm separated from him years later with a child and he has blown all of our money. If you have a suspicion, just leave.|`|BbRewQjQaa	It happened to my wives sister. She took a brick to her boyfriends head and crushed one of his testicles he won't do that again.|`|alYomnsvaa	I've never heard of this from anyone I know in person, only from anonymous online peeps.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I got to watch my brother and sister in law have a huge argument at thanks giving one year over who gave who gonera because they are both sluts.  It was very funny and a little depressing because that is when my wife realized the level of dysfunction.in my family.
NyIBY3jtaa	don't fight, express ur feelings but don't make it sound like ur blaming him.
n195n9Avaa	So you don't have your name on them right? If you do you will have to get them refinanced to get your name off anything.    If he promises you money I would write up a letter and have both of you go somewhere and get it witnessed and notarized, any bank usually does that.  That way if he tries to screw you over you have proof of what was suppose to be..    Good Luck|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You need to see a lawyer about this.    He/she will know best what steps you need to take.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	You might need to seek some legal assistance. From what I have learned from previous relationship experiences, once you break up, things can turn totally opposite...psychically and emotionally. I would not trust anyone.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You should sell both houses and split any proceeds, then go your separate ways.  It will cost a great deal to get your name off the deeds, which is what you have to do.  Even if he is the nicest guy on earth, what happens if 10 years from now he loses his job and falls behind on the mortgage?  Your credit goes down the tubes.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Why did he cancel a card on a joint account and how can he cancel YOUR card? Cancel his and get a lawyer.|`|AA11972752	I can pretty much guess that you feel responsible for the break up of this relationship, and you want to make up for it by requesting less of the financial assets when you leave. Let me tell you this: it won't make for an easier separation. The person you're leaving doesn't want to make it easy on you. The person who feels aggrieved in this situation wants to nail your hands to a stake for leaving them. If you request 10% in the separation, he'll fight you over that so that you get less... He'll be thinking to himself, "Oh you want 10%? Let's see how much you like 1%!" He's also a coward for lying to you about canceling the credit card. If you buy that story about it happening by accident, I'm sure there's a bridge he wants to sell you, too. But it sounds to me like you're onto his lies. He wants to be vindictive without having to look like he's being that way. Your best bet is to stand your ground on the divorce, instead of trying to give in so much to avoid any hard feelings. There's already hard feelings, so that's impossible. He wants to fight you on something to make it more difficult on you, but let him know that it's not in his best interests to make this into an all-out battle in the courts. Tell him you're willing to take less if he doesn't fight you over it, but if he decides to fight over it, you will go for what you're fully entitled to take (i.e., 50% of the assets). Maybe that will discourage him!|`|slJWqCI5aa	You need to get a lawyer - get it all in writing what your intentions are and progress from there. Sorry to hear about your situation, a break up is always hard!|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	If your name is on the deeds, you must do the right thing.  Both houses should be sold and the money should be split down the middle.  Nothing less, nothing more.  If he's already canceling cards, he's shown you that he's not doing things with your best interests in mind.  I've been involved with many similar situations, not with lovers, but with excess family interests.  Do not fold, take what's entitled and leave. If your one of two on the deed, take half. If you don't, you will in some way get screwed.  If you don't listen to any thing I've said, write this on your forehead: GET A LAWYER!|`|94a2fdc9dd2c5de57bb44aea7a35a494aa	I agree with other folks that you need to get a lawyer.  You may have some additional rights under common law type stuff (not sure though).. did you draw up a contract/lease?  People (even those we were close to) can't necessarily be trusted to do the "right thing" when it comes to money.  People can be brutal to one another.  I hope that you come out of everything okay!  Good luck to you!
sJTPzFdlaa	Honey, just be yourself. If you have to change to be with this guy then her's not worth ur time ok? Dont beg for him back, just talk to him like you would anyone else, be firends first and if things go well you might get back together. If not, it just wasnt meant to be
8WP9Gu1saa	Obviously she's interested to you but she still needs time to know you better and to be confident enough to hang out with you.  Show her the real you and show her you are sincere and not "just kidding".  Ladies, no matter how outgoing they are, wants to be respected and treated like a queen. Make her feel like a lady and you will both enjoy each others company.|`|DSMmF2Xuaa	She's teasing you. I reckon she likes yeh. Playing hard to get i reckon.
9ybVTCcnaa	Did you tell him how you feel about him? He may be avoiding you because he thinks you think differently about him after you found out that he likes you.|`|ZVngHOBTaa	thats what they do he likes you. strike up convo or something to make him feel less nervous around ya|`|UQft205Waa	Maybe he is in between relationships maybe another woman is giving him a hard time and he is stuck in a situation where he is with her one moment and not the next.....  could be the case|`|RUwkkEV9aa	Well, that's a little hard to answer. He could still like you, but not as much. Become friends with him, he might say something. Were, you happy that he liked you? Just see what happens later. I'm so sorry, I'm a bit confused.|`|8EauE2Nvaa	ehh im the same way with a girl i like i thinkicame onto hard so im easing off and trying not to directly associate with her for a bit. so just talk to him about it u prob played hardto get and he relized it|`|l9MPAp4xaa	Obviously he's shy, thats why he told his friend and not you about liking you and kept staring at you instead of talking to you. Basically, he was waiting for you to talk to him. When you didn't do it for 2 semesters, he thought you didn't find him attractive so now he is embarrassed.
xzX3NSUjaa	You could be anemic. I am and have the same problem..and my blood clots really quick.|`|8DTRylxiaa	Why is this under singles and dating?|`|LojhyKJhaa	well if there  was something wrong, then they would notice and tell you if they thought something of it when they took your blood don't you think? But if you really think it's a problem, then just ask.      IMB|`|ku6CnsV8aa	are you dating the doctor?
9pY7Sc47aa	Explain to him that you want to slow things down, that you feel that you both are too young to go this fast down this path.  Tell him that you think going on your own and being independent will be the best way for you to become the best person you can be (and for him also).    If he really cares for you, and is not just way too over-possessive and rushing things, he will want you to be happy, and to have a chance to grow.  If he has true feelings of love for you, he will only want for you to be happy, and he will let you go - knowing that if it is true love, it will withstand the test of time and you will eventually be together again.    You have to tell him how you feel, 100 percent every bit of it, and you will learn how much he truly cares for you, and how mature he truly is.  You have to do what makes you happy in life, and if he really loves you, he will want that for you too, whatever it is.    Best wishes   =)|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If you don't want to then don't. Trust your instincts.|`|dya8bP7oaa	I have to say Melanie is right!
eGpOIV12aa	i lived with a married woman for 7 years. waiting on her to divorce her husband so she and i could be married. she never divorced him.    i made the decision to move on.    glad i did.    now i am married to a wonderful woman and am a step dad to 2 beautiful daughters who i am adopting.    my ex is STILL not divorced after all this time
acWyJ3t0aa	No it does not mean that he likes you, it means like most young guys he was thinking with the small head between his legs . You definitely should not have kissed him unless you were out to lose your virginity and him too when he was done . Guys like easy girls until they have had them and then they will tell the world how easy it was to get you in bed , another conquest|`|kWIqDkB9aa	He could definitely like you! Sounds like a fun position to be in BTW! haha, I don't think its a bad thing you didnt kiss him, but if anything like that happens again, DO IT! Mmmkay? Happy loving :)
RvmYqQtRaa	So you want me to take a shot at this? It's tough very very tough. There's a million reasons for not asking you. Perhaps he's afraid of confrontation. Otherwise he may feel the relationship is hanging by a thread and one more argument will end it all. But there's really no good reason for his actions. Maybe there's someone else? One thing is for certain something made him doubt the relationship enough to disavow it. Even if it was for just a couple days. Actions like this make him very hard to trust. Be careful. Sorry this is so long.|`|bZ564q58aa	there's a saying "bros b4 hoes" not implying that u are just letting u know how guys think.  his Friend must be jealous that he likes u and doesn't want to see you guys together and he feels maybe that he needs to choose between u and his friend.  This will be just the beginning of many problems so if your up for it go head just don't be surprised.|`|CjeLOQ7Kaa	maybe he was scared of what your reacteon would be|`|81J81DGqaa	You did right for punching that guy. The thing is that he believe his friend, because it's his best friend. So that's why he was 100% sure and didn't want to even ask. He was just begging you to be with him, because he knew what you did, while you didn't know what. Just talk to your BF and say that you love him and that stuff. And really love him. (I mean hug him, kiss him and that stuff) He will be unsure if you love him for some days now, but it will be ok later.     Good luck.|`|e7qTRzfkaa	forget him hes just scared|`|sHBPfItfaa	Maybe he didn't ask because he was afraid it would be true, and he didn't want to hear that. But once he found out it wasn't true he regretted leaving you. I think he loves you and just over reacted. How would you react if you heard he kissed your best friend? I think you should definitely try and give it another shot with him. He must care about you, other wise he wouldn't get so mad about a rumor and would've asked you first. If you do get back together reassure him you would never do something like that.|`|707gOCvbaa	You should be upset with both esp your guy because he should of trusted you enough to ask, This pretty much tells you a lot about his personality and he will more than likely believe his friends first.  I say give him another chance but if something similar should occur then it's best to move on. good luck dear.|`|aEonduUUaa	its really ur bf's decision. Some guys lose interests and then realizes what they did wrong like i did with my ex.. but not the same scenario like urs..so its his fault so dont go back to him.|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	I am patient for example...i'm dealing with a girl right now who's amazing and i'm a bit bored but I'll stick with it, cause a girl like her is hard to find. I don't want to regret making the mistake of breaking up.|`|dU5RD79Paa	Probably you should be mad at him, and perhaps he didn't tell you because he thought you would be angry with him.
nUBCopgeaa	After having read several of your questions I have came to the conclusion that you put far too much time into worrying  about what is normal and what is not.  Please define normal.  Is It common for a 28 year old to be a virgin.... No.  But who the hell cares. It beats being a whore. If you are doing what you think is right that's all that matters. What society thinks and what those around you think should hold little to no value.   If you are depressed about this, I don't mean to be sarcastic. but drunk women  with no self respect come a dime a dozen.    Good Luck with your quest for sex!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	its pretty weird. i wouldn't date you.|`|aexekiU9aa	that's fine!!  u dont have to be ashamed!!    dont u think it's cool??!!  then u're a good man.... not a jerk...|`|dWwIEqEwaa	thats depends if you are waiting until marriage or just to find the right girl, then its perfectly normal and really sweet too :)|`|AA11091817	Normal as in common? No. That's rare.    Normal as in it doesn't make you somehow a lesser individual? Yes, it is normal.    Take your time.

Z3a1cRL7aa	I know that you are asking the ladies, but... I shave my balls, perineum, and make a nice patch or "landing strip".  I think that it should be common courtesy to keep that area neat and trim no matter what gender you are.  If you don't keep it clean, how can you expect your partner to keep theirs clean?  If I were you and my partner had a nasty bush, I would let mine go to waste and see how they reacted.  If my girl asked me, although she will never need to, to shave down there I might be a little put off at first, but anyone should be able to understand why a girl or guy would want it to be nicely groomed.  Hope this helps. +10?|`|xpiGWrdMaa	i dont mind it.  i don't even notice. who cares.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	trim is fine|`|9Y9BBB99aa	im a dude and i shave  i think all girls perfer it|`|rOeUOFZOaa	My lady won't let me shave.... anything.

aKC6KRxgaa	The main reason Women think that they should always get full custody is because the Judges and Courts always gave them custody automatically for so many years.  They think they are entitled.      Also, because women always "won" in court, it seems that Men aren't given the knowledge and strategy on how to win.  So the woman's feeling of their  "right of entitlement" continues because, although better, courts still give women much more custodial time than men in general.    Men have to wake up.  They need to talk to experts and find out how to "level the playing field" with custody mediators, counselors and courts.  The problem is, even most attorneys, don't give Dad's the detailed information they need to succeed in court.    A lot of the things needed to succeed in court come to women more naturally than men.  I don't know why this is, but it is a fact.  So men have to work a little harder, and find out just what they need to say and how to act and what to do to win custody.  This can go back even to before a couple separates and throughout a court action and modifications thereafter.    So seek information.  Not that I am touting my own site, however, I am a Family Law Specialist, having 30 years of litigation experience.  I have lived through the frustrations of my male clients.  I became so frustrated with the system, and lack of knowledge on the part of male clients,  I finally decided to write an ebook.  I include in the ebook in detail, what Men need to know  to win custody.  My website is www.FathersWinCustody.com.  I hope you will share this with all frustrated Dads.    Sincerely,    Dianne R. Ophelia, esq.|`|domEftoIaa	no its not that it just that a mother has a closer connection with the child or children(if they are a good parent). just think she went through nine months of pain and agony and then delivered the baby why shouldn't they get them.men just don't understand what its like.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I don't think anyone should get complete custody but I do think the kids need one place to call home and not be moved back and forth every other day/week/year. They need stability more than ever after divorce. Plus I think the non-custodial parent should have access to the child beyond the "weekend dad/mom" status.   More importantly... I think when parents divorce they should both try to be a little more mature and unselfish and a little less spiteful for the sake of the child(ren). And NOT use the kids as a way to hurt the other person.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	Women who act like that are immature and they treat their kids more like dolls...and less than human. They fail to realize that the best kids will have a decent male role model around.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You haven't said WHY you suggest that you should have full custody. Why DO you think you should have full custody? Personally, if my husband suggested that he should have full custody for no good reason, I'd be angry. It's as if you're suggesting that she's not a good mother, or doesn't deserve the kids. And it sounds like you are the one being stupid...not her. Your temper tantrum about the third answer proves that point. It's hardly about power...it's about being a mother. You CAN'T carry the kid for nine months. It's true that you're no less important, but how dare you suggest that you're MORE important than her? I think that you need to get over yourself and settle for joint custody if your ex is a good mother.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	This will not be a popular answer, but in my opinion, an accurate one. I have two children from a previous marriage, and there were a lot of benefits to having my children fully. The most important reason was that none of us were going to abused physically or otherwise on a regular basis (I know that is not your case, nor is it for the majority of custody issues). Save that reason, I wanted my children because I felt that I had a better instinct when it came to their needs, I felt that my education allowed for me to provide more financially, and I (selfishly) didn't want anyone to tell me that I was the lesser parent (regardless of whether that was their actual opinion). My ex husband never opted for custody, but I would have fought it with every ounce of my being.   I think a lot of women think they can't survive (financially) without child support. In fact, I know a couple going through a divorce now, in which the children have been in the custody of the father for the last 28 of 30 days, and she is still fighting for custody, solely for child support. She has stated several times that she "needs" it to get on her feet.  I also think that a woman may feel that anything less than full custody would insinuate that she is everything less than a full-time mother. And in the world of women, there's a lot of pride associated with how you raise your children, and how much time you spend with them.  I think there are a lot of cases in which the father should have full custody. My husband has a daughter from a previous marriage. Her mother is of pitiful character, and is very financially irresponsible, regardless of the amount of money my husband pays beyond the required child support. The child would be better off with us, but because he is military, the court believes the mother (who cheated with her husbands best friend, got pregnant, got divorced, aborted the baby, and explained it all to her five year old daughter) was more suitable.   So not "women" but SOME women, are ignorant, just like SOME men are ignorant. It's not a gender-specific problem. It's just a rampant one :o). Good Luck. Hope it all works out for you.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	To accuse all women of being "stupid" only shows your own ignorance and immaturity.  That having been said, perhaps she knows what kind of person you are, verbally abusive for one, and wishes to protect her child from you.  You may very well be a great father, in your own eyes, but in hers and in the courts eyes you may irresponsible.|`|2Is13nu8aa	I dont think all woman should. But if its a case like mine where your child is being shuffled around cause the dad doesent really want them. Then the mother should get full custody. Or in cases of abuse. As for woman who think they should,and there is no good ecxcuse for it. There being selfish,and not only that there hurting there child,children more than they realize. I know this wasnt really an answer but the other person who answered didnt factor in all situations.|`|lJPKjVqIaa	Because of how the world use to be (like 10-20) years ago, women were generally given custody over fathers as more were stay at home mom's and well thats just how society was. As our world has evolved we see much more joint custody and mothers are not automatically given custody. They come into it thinking that it is a womans god given right to have her children and receive child support from the father, normally not the case anymore. Good (mature) parents don't fight about it when they break up, they come up with a plan together about how they want to live thier lives and how their children should live their lives, unfortunately this is not how it usually ends up. Women think they have the upper hand......but its not always the case and this misperception often gets them in trouble. I took my ex to court to establish 50/50 custody and she tried to fight it, from the time she was served with paperwork she did not allow me to see my son for nearly a month and the judge was outraged, he informed her of all the state statutes she broke by keeping my son from me. I think it goes both ways though.....nobody likes to lose, everbody wants to win, and nobody likes a draw.|`|NuCu5RbTaa	i have joint custody with my ex, i have never had any problems over it. but probably we have different definition of joint custody. in my case they (kids) live with me all the time and go spend over night once a week at his place. on weekend. i think this is wise - we live not far from school, we have big house. he lives in apartment, so where will he put all those 3 grown up boys? but if u define joint custody as a child spends one week at her place and one week at your place this is just simple wrong. a child has to have one place a child calls home, where all his belongings are. a child should visit only one school, where all his/her  buddies are. so joint custody or no joint custody i think u should sacrifice your ego and your desires for the sake of your child being happy. otherwise u shouldn't have divorced a child's mother|`|5LT6LRUZaa	as long as the parents put the child, his/her feelings, their needs and upbringing first and foremost I encourage joint custody always!    my son's father and I split when I was pregnant...he takes our son 3 days a week...picks him up every morning for school and occasionally stops by after work to say hello...he is remarried with a 9 month old with his wife...we spend holidays together and have even traveled together, even though we have a joint arrangement he still pays me child support because he's got a two income household and I only have a one income household...I provide all of my son's medical coverage, this arrangement works for us...but more importantly it works for my son...as odd as some people view the friendship between myself and his father and step mom....what matters the most is my child's happiness and that he is also not raised away from his little half brother...now the only other way to make that possible would be for him to live with his dad full time?  why is that necessary?  it's not...my son has a damn good father and regardless of our breakup and the bumps we've had in the road we do raise him together even though we are not together...it can be done and I've actually have had really good friends "scold" me for having this type of arrangement but...they are haters...their kids' dad's don't provide etc, well I will not apologize for the fact that my son's father IS there    I understand the whole carrying the child for 9 months...there is no doubt in my mind that during that 9 months that baby was all mine!  but..once he was born and a bond was formed with his father who the hell am I to interfere with that relationship...I know if anyone had ever interfered with the relationship I had with my dad I would never forgive them...if the reasoning is greed or pride...you women need to get over yourselves and put the child first!  Father's are important for children...just as important as mothers...I decided a long time ago that my child deserved better than what most kids of divorce get...and that I will walk through fire to make sure he gets exactly what he would have had if we had stayed together outside of us all being in the same home    if your ex is not being reasonable and you can show the court that you are worthy of joint custody..don't wait for her permission...file for it yourself!  this isn't about YOU or HER it's about your SON and about both of you being able to provide a stable partnership in raising him...too many men take off...too many women trade off "uncles" as being daddy...it's time for parents to be forced to set their pride aside and provide the best possible scenario for the children....    yes I realize there are those POS that don't deserve their kids...but I'm speaking of the GOOD PARENTS that provide more than just being a wallet...I will NEVER regret making our arrangement...my son is a very happy boy having so many people that love him!|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I do not like the broad generalization about all women being stupid when it comes to shared custody.  My ex husband and I have two children together and share our children just fine!  We live about 7 blocks apart and each have the children 3-4 days a week depending what we each have going on that week.  It works out great for both of us and the children each get to see both of their parents on a very regualr basis.
ggfE4rlvaa	Probably the same, guys are just more open about it, where girls talk about it with friends.|`|MkchPOjFaa	I never thought about it when i was a virgin i really aint care...but when i met my boyfriend and we had did it for the first time...yea...just know he calls mi a freak now hahahaha=]|`|6SB4ufEYaa	A lot.|`|CIibuO57aa	I think about it more than you, but I am having it as much as you are thinking abou it.|`|AXS3y0u7aa	Girls really do think about it a good bit. We also talk about it a lot as well. I remember being on the bus in high school, and having to hear my best friends gush on and on about their boyfriends/ current lovers and how good/bad they were in bed, and then have class with before mentioned boyfriends/lovers.    But yeah, there is really no difference in how much guys and girls think about sex.|`|jVe7NaEqaa	i read somewhere that guys think about sex about once everything 3 minutes. im not sure exactly what it is for girls, but im sure we think about it a lot more than people think we do. its not like since we're girls we are somehow more 'pure' or whatever. our thoughts can get downright dirty too. i think the major difference is that we don't normally share them in some of the ways guys do.

Z3a1cRL7aa	That's tough.  I would say that you should have broken it off with Kyle prior to him leaving on his mission.  You knew that he would be going, you are Mormon correct?  So, to break up with him now, knowing that you will want to be with him later is very selfish.  I am not Mormon, but have done a year long mission through my church, and I know that I was very lonely during that year.  If someone that I loved very much would have cut the ties to me simply because I was away and it was difficult, I would have been devastated.  You should be able to see that this is difficult for him as well.  If I were you and decided to break it off with him, I would fly to where he is and do it in person.  I know that this is against the "rules" but there are some things that are more important than rules, people feelings.  Seeing him might even make you understand why you are(or aren't) willing to wait.  They payoff in waiting could be huge.  Hope this helps.|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	its a tough choice, i say wait for kyle|`|u72QPS8jaa	dont dump someone you love for someone you like  coz someone you like will dump you for someone they love!    love is patient!it sounds like you really like kyle so if you can i think its best you wait he will appreciate it and love you more coz you loved him unconditionally.but if you really feel that it has come to an end and you really cant wait and want to be with your guy friend than so be it. at the end of the day you should do what makes YOU happy    goodluck:)|`|c3W9o5Wcaa	talk to kyle about it...don't make a decision you're going to regret|`|lbdktbteaa	if its real love, the best thing to do is wait for him, 2 months is too fast to move on.  but if is not, then move on and find the love of ur life.  i love  my  boyfriend, and if this happened i could not even look at anyone   else
hbrtQXX2aa	your just being jealous dear!    your boyfriend needs you.(most especially this time of his life)  don't break him up, i beg you.    i think you just misunderstand whats happening. maybe there are things that you don't know since you both barely see each other    you two need communication!  don't let this simple thing end your relationship, be wise girl!  you know him 3 years ago but it's just lately to become lovers, what i mean is you realized that you loved each other and so it's GOOD!  it's not flirting.    then the next step for you to do is visit him, talk to him seriously about what you really feel but don't be insensitive of what he feels.  LISTEN carefully of what he is talking about and don't talk while he's talking.just listen first then talk after him.calm down girl, its just a simple problem..  (i think i should be the one who should be calm..lol..just kidding in this last part..)  take care  i hope my answer will quite help my dear..  :)|`|H82ghmAvaa	That is a really hard one.  I think that yes, you should. That is so sneaky going behind your back, and it's not right, even if he is sick or not.     Just make sure to be very sensitive when you do it, he's having a hard enough time with everything, he doesn't need you to be mean to him.    Lots of luck.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Don't jump to conclusions--why don't you talk to him about your feelings, and maybe he has a reasonable answer. I wouldn't break up with him at this difficult time though--atleast not yet.|`|rd5468H1aa	Don't be too hasty; maybe he had a reason for wanting her to come. I think you should just confront him about it first before you break up with him.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	do some soul searching.|`|MjfXRtmTaa	wait and see first.  if he is already ill, don't make it worse  but if you find that he is cheating on you in anyway then break up|`|qpkNrn8iaa	u shuld confront him about it... i wuld be really mad to but jus confront him
EZKe92TTaa	I think you're not giving your wife or women in general enough credit. While physical attributes are important, in the long run, you're going to sleep every night with a person, not a penis or other body parts. She loves you for who you are as a whole. I realize you lack self confidence so you are asking us here, but trust her. She would not have bothered marrying you if she didn't think you were worthwhile. You probably treat her very well. Have confidence in that. When a person feels wanted in a relationship, where both partners are equals, both strive to make it work, each is treated with respect and kindness, then it's a formula for success.|`|cBcGwCZraa	size doesnt matter  if it did alot of good men would be in trouble|`|NzVQs41yaa	you answered your own question when you told us she thinks the world of you and has married you m'dear :)|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Size of what?    Size of your bank account?  Size of the house you bought?  Size of your car?  Size of your hat?    Get it now?|`|taQFWXuHaa	Size tends to be a big issue with you men.....my husband use to obsess with his penis being too small but he has no problems when we are in action so i dont think you have anything to worry about. He does not have the biggest penis in the world nor the smallest so as long as he pleases me....which he does... i have no problem with it.I am sure that your wife is happy with you and if you say she is pleased with you size then she is bc us women dont tend to lie about those kind of things!!!! good luck and keep your head up!!!!|`|xV4qOG4Iaa	Size does not matter, as long as your wife has not said anything then why worry after all she is the only one you have to please, as as long as you continue to please her which you will do for years then don't worry about it. And as a woman it has never bothered me as to what size a man is and i think you have the wrong idea that women prefer well endowed men well maybe a few but i don't think that all are like that.|`|AA11181695	Okay I know it said "ladies" but I think when asked "does size matter?" or "do men like big breasts?" people answer politically correctly or in a way not to hurt feelings.  But c'mon be real. Of course penis size matters to women and of course men like big breasts. People tend to qualify like it is not the size but the technique or the caring or the love between  etc . But I think if the question was asked "If absolutely everything else under the sun was equal - without exception - would size matter (to men or women) the answer would be overwhelming - bigger is better.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	No, personally I do not like or want a big penis.  I am a small person, 5'3", and I prefer a man with a smaller one that will fit me comfortably. A large one would not only hurt, but my ex kept giving me painful ovarian infections from bumping my ovaries on the inside with his large one.|`|AA10423276	size doesn't matter to most women (i can only speak for myself and a dozen friends i've talked to) specially when a gal is in love. the last thing on her mind is the size of his dicky boo. what matters more is that     1) you listen to her. and talk to her a lottttt.    2) you're sincere with her and never cheat around.    3) you fullfil her needs financially and provide her financial, physical and emotional security.     4) you are always there for her and take her side every time.     etc etc....|`|nCrbKAuzaa	it wont matter on the size, its how you do it. ;p
wGw834Gkaa	I actually worked with a person who retired from our company to become a realtor.  I live in a small area, I would have talked to people I know to see who they used.  I am lucky, my Mom knows a bunch of bankers and my Dad is a carpenter so I know I got the best rate and my house is well built.  Do you have any friends/family with skills that will help you?  Watch out for fast talkers.  If you feel like someone is trying to dump any old house on you then find someone else.  BIG WARNING!  Don't assume the title company knows what they are doing.  They gave my bank the wrong address, I turned on the utilities at the wrong house, cost me lots of $$ and embarrassment and I paid hell getting my taxes paid.  It sucked!  There is no substitute for doing your homework, get on line and everywhere else and check out everything.  Check out the neighbors, the neighborhood, etc.  Spend some time there before deciding.  For example, my neighbors have 4 kids and 3 of the little monsters chase my truck down the street and jump on my dog and climb the fences and throw stuff in my yard.  Will you be in a place with a bunch of sirens, like by a hospital or police station?  What are taxes in the area?  I wound up in a place with state, county and CITY taxes.  It's a fun process, just make sure you check out all sorts of things.|`|5k7BexD3aa	We talked to friends to see who they used.  If you ask around, people will give you the names of realtors that worked with them and were honest and upfront.
ENYYtrs8aa	well, it depends. do you like her. also, did she ask him first? if she did then she liked him more. but if you like her then sure. ask the chick out. ur the only one in her mind now.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Yes, Oh Psycho one.|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Don't go out with her out of pitty because at one point you are going to live her & go to the person you live &she will be hate again. So if you love her & you know that she does then go right ahead coz if someone else gets her before you,you will be hate. Hope you will make the right decision.
aEonduUUaa	My saying is "Love is forever, Its our choices that keeps it forever" think about it|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	it often means that when you stop bowing to her every whim she will lose interest.|`|EHCM324Faa	I think she will make you do anything she said because your soo into her but you should just pretend you don't like her and make her come to you.|`|SV0LZWUiaa	the only thing that prevents a relationship from working is - bad health.  the only thing that can heal bad health is - good girl. shiit my head is so wachachak but i have no choice but to wait for her.|`|RITOVkdAaa	It can be bad for the relationship and for the future. I don't think you should be stuck on someone when you guys have barely started going out. What is going to happen is that as the relationship keeps going you gonna be more and more stuck on her and when she does something that will hurt you, you'll forgive her like nothing which is good, but can lead to her hurting you more in the future. It's ok to be stuck on someone but then again make sure your not WHOOPED and thats always hard to admit, make sure that if your going to be doing a lot for her, that she'll do a lot for you too. Find a balance and try to make the realationship as even as possible.     Good luck|`|A2u06IS1aa	I would say so. If she knows you really really like her, and she isnt different about it, it really depends. If shes more, mroe serious with you or not. If she is, then she probably feels the same way, but if she backed off a bit, she's either shy and has to get used to the fact that you like her a lot, or she doesnt like you as much anymore.
UinOWcMUaa	You know I've studied this for years. Your right NVC (Non Verbal Communication) is important and overlook greatly. Simple, as pie brother but i give you the answer with purest of motivations. 1st stand up straight as this portrays health and posture. 2nd naturally smile, and 3rd always look into the eyes as they are the windows to the soul. Be yourself because if you try to act anything out, then later the truth comes out, so just stay natural and calm, confident and assure of what you want and what your doing !!|`|PSzZen5Maa	Read this book.   The Game   By: Neil Strauss    It helps with the incorporation verbal and non verbal communication when it comes to women.|`|PuopJHPcaa	always be the lead when ur with a girl u should always walk in front and not let he take the lead  when ur sitting always lean back and never come in front|`|WBVw1SK0aa	Any chance you get to put your hand on her arm or on her face do it!! (no where else!!)    Try to touch her hair and her face the most, it shows affection    When dating, and you are walking together either hold her hand or put your arm around her, depending on her weight or height maybe holding her hand would be a better choice.     Make sure you open every door, pull out every chair and take her coat. Women still love a good old fashioned gentleman.    If you wont hold her hand or put your arm around her then never walk faster then a woman, walk the same pace.    If you are going to be in a sexual relationship, after making love or having sex which ever you prefer to use, touch her face and look into her eyes and give her a complement.     hope it helps??
Vr6L81iiaa	I'm not exactly sure haha I remember when a guy would imitate me around ME. It was a little annoying but I just laugh over it now.

I would never reject my girl whatever happens.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	whats your question denn|`|ED9sFeRQaa	Just have a chance to move face to face|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Take a chance and make a move. If he rejects you, then another guy will come into your life.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	if he doenst make a move back make sure to take it slowly and get him more interested in you because guys are supposed to make the move
3c93a6700ef8bf8ade1c6ea833102909aa	For most women (most likely the ones you should be looking for) it wouldn't be a turnoff.    Do you know how sexy that is?    I'd love to find you.|`|drxoohVRaa	Why would that be a turnoff?? I am pretty sure your future wife will not want to know with how many women you've been with. I really don't see the big deal with guys being virgins. It's not going to be any different since you'll be starting out slow anyway when it comes to sex. Also, you will most likely find someone that shares the same values as you do.|`|l01wsneiaa	no way, super sweet!  i'm also a virgin (19 y/o), and that's sometimes pretty hard to find, so  it's nice to share that someone else is waiting for "the right time"|`|iLk1LRz1aa	No! If I liked the guy I wouldn't have any problem being with him if he was a virgin or not. Come to think of it, most of the guys I've dated have been, but they lost it to me haha|`|xHKRGEg4aa	It would be really really sweet to find a 20 year old guy who is still a virgin. I wouldnt want him to be completely clueless about what goes on, but it would be extremely cute if he was still a virgin, & i wouldnt have a problem dating a virgin. Some of my best boyfriends were the ones that werent wrapped up in sex.|`|P38ULZbraa	I would totally wait! I think it's good that you have waited, it will make your first time even more special [:
e6rveQ8qaa	I say you just tell him straight up that you think he's a freak :)|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	If that is what you dress like everyday in your avatar, I can understand why.|`|d8mJAuz1aa	no comments. i wish to say something; but, not in this answer. take care a lot. NO undo button will work for human life.|`|CJQkksuqaa	**** you *****  you're already dead.  Did you come back from the grave or are you just a old 50 yearold fart pervert still jacking off to a bardot movie.|`|8iXM26HTaa	He likes you but is to shy to talk to you|`|W2Qegyrqaa	probably thinks you're cute, but scarred to approach you
ODGWM7vUaa	It seems like a complex situation, but give yourself a chance and think what you really want. Take a step back and breathe. You care for him but don't you think you are suffocating and overpowering what you had: a strong friendship. Some people take longer to reach commitment and as a good hearted person you should let the person reach that threshold at their own pace.So be a little more patient.    If you want to meet him in person and he is reluctant their is probably a simple he hasn't. It might simply to far. Maybe you have to wait till both of you have time.    And for the Question: Should you leave him?  What do you want?    Remember you should be honest with yourself and at the same time give yourself a chance. If love does not work the first time give it time.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	move on. forget about it. try another way. leave him and the next one and the next one. just work on yourself and career.|`|CU1WRghVaa	are you guys on a online relationship..that kinda creepy and childish no offense. Tell him to come meet you or you will just have to leave him.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	blah blah blah blah and on and on and on . . . .   It is a voice. A picture. You are in love with the idea of being in love.

People don't pull time out of nowhere.  2. marriage seems a little far for a man you haven't met.  3. well he seems like a nice lad.    I wouldn't break up with him. He seems to be great.    But that's just how I see it.|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Well, reason  1 is a bit normal from his perspective. If you live in the U.S. or canada or somewhere large, where it takes more than what can be driven in a few hours easily dont expect him to be able to visit you. Being able to visit means taking time off if he has a job or in school, so don't pressure him to visit you. Don't get married unless you do end up visiting each other often. Thats all i can say.|`|NSBgGwSmaa	... i would say leave him it sounds like hes all talk and no action and hes making alot of excuses     i dont think you should get more involved when it sounds like he doesnt want to|`|0vhx7Putaa	True "love" can over come anything. Why you don't find someone closer I don't know. You're 20, go out and meet someone.  Think hard about it, do you really love him? If so try to make it work, if not cut your looses and find someone else. Speaking from experience its better to be hurt now than 5,10,15 years down the road.|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Overall that guy sounds like he has some issues and needs to get into some counseling.  However I'm going to address your concerns that you posted at the bottom first.  1. you asked him to come and meet you and he can't.  well how far away do you live from each other.  Different states or something (if your in the US)  point is traveling costs money and maybe he doesn't have the money to plunk down on a plane ticket.  But in contrast he should be able to generate money if he saved up within a month it doesn't cost that much to fly especially when someone will give you a ride (no rental car fee.)  2.  Marriage seems like a huge step.  You would freak out any guy that you dropped that on I mean you haven't seen him in person yet.  Why not hold back on that.  Asking him what his views are on marriage is fine but making him commit is nuts.  3. Ultimatums never work so don't bother.   To sum up cut him some slack, but be weary of his issues because any guy like that seems clingy in a unhealthy sort of way.|`|RTxFNURzaa	Wow your talking about marrying someone you've never met no wonder hes freaked out that is messed up
AA11542500	I agree with lexi.  Immature guys will say stuff like that because they like you and won't admit it.  He probably doesn't even know how to get a girl's attention...other than negative attention.  For what it's worth, you're definitely not ugly.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	no, your not ugly, the boy was just being a jerk.  Advice though? brush your bangs back a little more, so your face shines out, you have really pretty eyes.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	you're alright.  you're not ugly.|`|kpIs37Pqaa	lol ur not ugly at all (im a guy)    ill  give u an 7.. im being honest|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Guys say stupid crap to girls all the time to get them all riled up.  Don't you ever let something some stupid guy says make you feel insecure.  Now, either lose the bangs or cut them shorter.|`|Qz3sii2caa	I don't think you're smokin' hot, but you're definitely not ugly. You look like your garden variety teenage girl. Nice skin, pretty eyes, natural look. If there was anything to change, you could use a new hairstyle that shows off your face rather than hides it. I'm sure you'd be even prettier if you were smiling. You have a nice canvas, so a little lip gloss couldn't hurt.    I give you a 7.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	maybe a 6.

Your first pic does look ugly but the second one you look cute. But personally don't worry about what others say just do you and watch where you'll be 5 years from now and they watch them. Don't worry about what others think because that'snot gonna get you anywhere.|`|ntlXw3nvaa	why are you so worried about what some dumb *** guy has to say about you?? he must like you, thats prolly why he's making stupid comments about you. your very pretty|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	why do you listen to people who must be blind or just stupid you are quite good looking|`|fZCfJWpOaa	That guy's an a**.

I'll give you an 8|`|cewWPIzIaa	You are not ugly.  In fact, you're very pretty.      Guys can be real jerks sometimes.  I can't really explain it, but sometimes a guy will be a jerk when in fact they do like you.  They don't know how to express their feelings, so they act like a jerk thinking they are being funny or cool.  Or maybe they are trying to push you away so they don't have to face their real feelings.  Whatever the reason, don't let this jerk make you question anything about yourself.  In ten years he will probably be of no importance in your life.|`|zoMMNwXcaa	hideous|`|lhqqDCrAaa	You are soo not ugly!

There are going to have to deal with it! ; )|`|880810d4326c921557a558c16c9d1c6daa	You would probably look better if you looked at the camera when taking the picture. It makes your lower jaw look longer than it is. But I would say you are definitely not ugly. That guy is just an a**. You are probably about a 6. You still have to grow into your face though, since you are fairly young. I didn't grow into my body and face completely until I was about 19years old, and it's still changing.|`|Z3B8UzmYaa	Follow these steps:  Get some makeup that make you look tan or just get a tan  Dont put your hair like that it makes you look got make it to the side where they can see your face  get some makeup that doesnt look So goth okay?|`|p8fD4thJaa	Nah ur not ugly I guess 7|`|c32MJwDJaa	ur like a 7 or 8  have a little confidence|`|zGhDt3dpaa	Let me answer from a real guy's point of view. Forget all the other assholes who will comment here. You are not ugly at all, honestly. forget that guy in school. Guys say stupid things(myself included)|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	I think you should stop being so sensitive to what other people think about you. Who cares really what some guy said about you? Do you like this guy coz he sounds like a jerk if he's going around telling people they are ugly.     Be confident in knowing that you are beautiful and others will find you beautiful as well.|`|YJjcqoUKaa	i don't think your ugly    but remember one thing  even though one guy thinks that you are ugly another may not  everyone has different taste   if everyone liked that same type of people then no one would have a significant other.    don't let it get to you and lower you confidence bc people can be cruel.    and he might just like you too  you never know.|`|l01wsneiaa	no, you're not ugly,    he's a dick, and he probably likes you.|`|fvFpKFpZaa	no some girls think they are ugly because other girls would say that you are ugly but you are NOT an ugly girl I had the same problem the girls in school said that I was ugly and I suck ,but I didn't listen to them and now I think I am pretty  and they suck so I think all girls have a part of them that is pretty and look for the heart if they have a nice good heart  ok thank you|`|l435VrtUaa	You have natural beauty. In today's world that means nothing since even ugly celebrity's can be famous and considered pretty.

And when you present yourself as a strong  individual more than capable of replacing them  that puts you in a very valued (classy, desired) light.     It's not so much the moving on, it's the absolute confidence and strength that you have (to move on) that he's now seeing and wants.
3PlT64Yuaa	Being good looking has it's advantages, but it can also make you resent some people when you find out that they only do things for you because of the way you look. From there, you start to have trouble trusting people and discerning between those that truly appreciate you as a person, and those that only treat you as eye candy.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	It hasn't made that big a difference in my life.  I've been told all my life that I'm good looking.  On the other hand, I'm happily married with a good job and 2 great kids.  So nothing was given to me because of my looks, but I did turn out alright.|`|xkgcYeXPaa	having nice bodies? Are you Siamese twins?|`|5UwQtCzOaa	it really depends on what you are wanting and whom you are trying to get it from...  there are different levels of effect... some people are easier to convince than others...|`|f4doqdSCaa	It might get you noticed by more people, just for appearance purposes, but eventually they're going to be looking for some real substance.    My point is, you may have a few more opportunities, but looks will only get you so far, and they don't last forever.|`|1zwxspIAaa	The only people who wouldn't care are blind people.|`|EHCM324Faa	It can go so far but when the time comes your not going to have it that long|`|6Fp1KVIKaa	Having much experience in this subject I can answer you simply that its ....Freakin AWESOME!!!
eYlCBHPHaa	Do you say hello to them?  You may be Mr. Good-Influence..but it doesn't necessarily mean you have proper etiquette around them.
EeThBc3Zaa	Depends what you mean.  Tell him you're seeing a new guy who's a teacher and you're bringing him to the work Christmas party?  Sure.  Telling him you went on a hot date last night and describing the fantastic oral sex in detail...um, no.|`|AA10628838	Right, his wife doesn't know you two are friends. Very inappropriate.|`|707gOCvbaa	Nothing wrong unless he ask you out. be cautious.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	this is the way emotional and full blown affair begin, and its not right.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Yes it's wrong......for exactly the reason you just said.  His wife doesn't know that yall are friends.  This means that apparently he feels it's inappropriate and that's why he doesn't divulge this friendship to his wife.      And of course you're going to say, well he's the one that's married, not me.  But the person who participates in a relationship that could ultimately be detrimental to a marriage, is just as guilty as the married person who is allowing himself to be a part of the friendship.    He likes you, as you've said, so I'm sure you are flattered by the attention he gives you.  But things you don't expect tend to creep up on you before you realize it and I see something more than a friendship coming if you don't end this personal relationship.  It doesn't matter if you are only talking at work.....you aren't just talking shop.....so it has become personal.  End this before you get even more emotionally involved.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	nothing wrong with it in fact you might learn a thing or two from a guy like that.|`|GfphOIdOaa	Talking about it is not wrong. If he is having a surrogate experience dating you/other people through the stories he asks, that is his immorality, not yours. Beware though not taking this friendship too far, for breaking up his marriage would be bad. Naughty girl!|`|AA12014364	Yes it is wrong! He is a married man and he should not be interested in your dating life. He will start seeking more personal details about your dates and may start to stalk you. Do not get overly personal with friends from work, it shows poorly on your professional career. Think about his wife for a second and let them enjoy a peaceful married life. He is out of the game and you should not be enticing him with your dating life.|`|elhcuN19aa	in this case yes it is|`|i1rDJY2aaa	How would you feel if you were in her shoes?  Wouldn't you be hurt if your husband were talking to a sweet young thing about her personal life? Wouldn't you be suspicious  that he kept a friendship with a young, single female hidden from you????|`|gaWZ79gNaa	hey Im going through the same thing. :) I think he likes me I am not too sure, either that or he is so interested and wants the best for me since he cant have me...hes married...see where I am going here. the only difference is that he is my boss, and i happen to like him alot!!    nysexyprchica@yahoo.com is my email if you want to talk more.    you are not doing anything wrong, he is, he is the one who is married not you. and maybe its all just innocent talk. you never know!    I will eventually delete this since I dont want it all out there!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Only if you're ok with him having an erection the entire time your're talking about your sex life. He sounds like a pervert.
O36qjj7Oaa	Innocent or not a married man shouldn't be e-mailing another woman at all.    He is disrespecting his wife by doing this.|`|wGw834Gkaa	They aren't innocent or you would not be asking.  Good rule of thumb, if you have to ask then you already know the answer.  I had something like this, except the guy was my college professor (we are both the same age), it rapidly became way more than innocent, in one evening.  (We were both single).|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Totally totally platonic and his wife doesn't know about it; that does raise a question. An honorable man or woman would tell their spouse or significant other.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	I'd be a little irritated because if he wants to just talk to someone, he should be talking to his wife. Just a quick email here and there wouldn't bother me, but if it was pretty much all day every day, then I would assume that at some point it is going to (or at least could very easily) turn into something way more.  Keeping a secret, too, makes it seem like cheating whether innocent or not.  I'm not trying to offend you in any way. I'm just being honest in saying how I would feel if it were my husband.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	He should be talking oi his wife and not needing to chat with single women behind her back. Sounds fishy.|`|AA12014364	This man is obviously interested in you and as long as the emails are platonic and about work it is ok. But the minute they start to get personal, it should be stopped. Married men should be left alone. Never get in between a marriage.|`|yev2iWgWaa	next time he e. mails you e.mail saying that will be redirected to his wife. it will stop. of course extramarital love has become common being friendly is different from being this mean.     fine lady god bless|`|E56MF3p6aa	Well every thing is depend on the intention on both end. If a married man is emailing you all day, he is trying to get personal with you or may be looking for intemacy. Its his job to manage his wife in a fair way. As far as you are concern, its upto you what you want from him, fair with his wife or flirt with you? Use your senses well before you decide. After all its your happiness that important to you.|`|zTQVC7GBaa	It is not ok and you know it.He is playing with his wife and wants to play with you and did that with many others before you.If you are good then tell his wife or just drop email for her or get where he lives.Good day|`|84sYXLk6aa	It's easy for you to ask your co-worker this very question. Also he'll do only what, and as much as  you allow him to do. I would say the wife, but of course she is unaware of this, but you don't have to be a part of it, bring it to a halt immediately. Think about it, you might marry one day, would you want your husband to be doing the same thing to you with another woman, and you have no clue this is going on? Put yourself in her shoes, see how it feels, I don't think you'll like it,and no, I am not blaming you, he knows he has a wife and family,but let him create his own mess with no thanks on your behalf.|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	He is laying the ground work for a more then friendly relationship....|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Obviously he shouldn't be emailing you all day. And obviously his wife would be pist. He's a pervert who wants to get some on the side with you. That's all. He probably jacks off on the the other end of the computer while you're emailing each other.
dmqVzSZKaa	That's not true. Let people date whomever they want to date.

88c4c1b53052663ce9e2c8ab0f941b2eaa	It all depends on many variants and situations.  Did he/she knew each other before you became partners and how long.. where they bf/gf?    Dependently on the agreement you have with each other and keep in mind country or friends certain customs.  -3 kisses on the cheek  -A hug  -Etc.    Suppose she knew him more than 5 years before we met, I would accept more than if it would be less. I would also ask once in awhile if I could join in one of those events: movie, diner, etc Because since we started a relationship, there should not be any secrets anymore. Nevertheless what happened in past is in the past.    So, it all depends.. this means also that she has to accept that I can do the same.    hope it helps|`|0eq7uuyLaa	I think it depends on the people in the relationship. Some people would be comfortable with it, and some wouldn't. It's more important to have enough trust in each other to be able to tell your significant other how you feel about it than it is to try to make yourself comfortable with something you just can't be.   But...with that being said, it is very possible for someone to have a close friend of the opposite sex with nothing else going on. Ifit bothers someone to a great extent, they should probably talk to their girlfriend/boyfriend about why they might have trust issues.
nA97uWdyaa	Smile, be unapologetically straightforward and honest, acknowledge her friends so that they don't feel ignored or disrespected, let go of your desire to control the outcome, and ask questions about her that you are genuinely interested in so that you can find out what you like about her other than her appearance.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Do looks matter? Yes. Attraction needs to be present in every relationship. Go up to her (I know, sounds scary) and just say something like "Hi, are you new here?" or perhaps something else (just start with an icebreaker). Girls find it flattering if random people walk up to them and start a conversation with them. It makes us realize other people find us attractive and/or want to get to know us. Don't be afraid, chances are she'll like you back, you are afterall a junior and she might like "older men" haha.|`|YpmcXaNJaa	Walk past her, being casual, and say hi|`|C3yE261uaa	ask one f your friends to hang around with her friend then go to her and say can I sit here seriously   I Iike  when a guy asks me this|`|pws2l0Ckaa	Make sure your first time talking to her is flawless. First impressions are extremely important.

ZSAbJEv6aa	The most common reason is falling out of love with each other that the relationship becomes intolerable for both or one partner.    Honeymoon is over as soon as the couple is jolted out of their fantasies and starts facing the real world.  Sometimes the love that binds a couple is not strong enough to withstand the tests of time - it wavers and it wanes.  The easiest exit is getting a divorce.  At other times, too, it is because the relationship has gone sour - no sparkle, no life; everything becomes a routine.    Like some fair-weather friends, marriage could also fall under this category for some people.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Usually, yes. But marriage takes a lot of work, just like anything else in life. Many people marry for the wrong reasons, or marry thinking the other spouse will change the way they want them to after marriage, etc. Some aren't willing to compromise or put the effort it takes towards making a marriage work. It comes to a point where giving up and divorcing is easier than working together, doing whatever it takes to make the relationship work.|`|AA10248966	The divorce rate for first and second marriages in the USA is over 50 percent because people did not take it seriously, except for perhaps the opportunity for some sex.|`|uNVOPkruaa	because nowadays people just take the easy way out on things.  they give up instead of actually working out.  people get so stressed out over money, work, kids, bills .. everything really. me and my boyfriend are not even married and we already fight over stupid things like money and what not. it's a shame because love is so much more important than any of that. it's kinda sad to think that nobody stays together anymore =[|`|RxBe4y3Waa	money and poor communication!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	i got divorced cause he became an abusive drunk. he would call me really nasty names he would grab my by my throat and throw me against the wall by my neck and he has punched me in the back of my neck, i could not take the abuse any more so when he was at work i packed my stuff and left. one of my cousins got divorced cause her ex would beat her up. he even  knocked her teeth out of her mouth.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	There is no one answer.|`|79eBn6V8aa	If only it were that simple.  Marriage is SO hard.  It is so hard to face the problems and stresses of life and deal with them with another person who may feel or react differently to things.  I am divorced and believe me when I say that I did EVERYTHING possible to keep my marriage together, but it takes two people working at it for that to happen.  I loved the good times that I shared with my ex.  The bad just outweighed the good on so many levels that I couldn't deal with it anymore.  It doesn't mean that I stopped loving him, I just couldn't let him bring me down anymore.|`|yRlIXECTaa	Some couples lose the "spark" in their relationship. So, They go looking for someone else who can give them that "spark"|`|aihdbyDAaa	sometimes people think they are feeling those emotions, because they are so caught up in the other person, that they realise they're not really meant for each other untill they;re married.
AA11925968	You need someone who will love you for you, not your $$$  Don't you want someone who will love you for YOU??  If a girl only wants you for your $$, what happens if you run out of $$??|`|EDYETUNCaa	My ex spent lots of money on. Even gave me so many flowers I never wanted to see another one again. Bought and gave me everything I wanted. I felt so smothered. So trapped that finally I broke up with him. My current bf isn't rich. He's amazing. He gives me surprises and tells me that he can't buy me everything but that he really loves me. That means more to me than anything my ex every bought me.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	if they are shallow gold diggers.  find a girl who will want you for you, not the money.
xpiGWrdMaa	You can't lose interest in women.  You are a man. Please be realistic. I'm sure there are lots of girls who like short guys.  You just need to find a really really short girl.  Or pick on the ugly ones who will be happy to date anyone. Don't worry, you're still young yet, one will come around for you.|`|zGhDt3dpaa	loosing interest is not the answer at all. There are plenty of women out there and you just have to wait longer. The worst you can do is just give up and try to "loose interest!" You will never loose interest, you are fighting human nature!

aIfwQCgHaa	it sounds to me that he genuinely wants to move forward with you in the relationship regardless of your current financial situation. With guys it's really not that complicated. We only look at the potential for the future, not your current situation.  if something is there, we don't care how broke you are, cause we know it'll come back around.. and most of us don't throw out invites just out of pity. Cause then it has potential to backfire on us.. But, just a heads up, if he continues to invite you places and you continue to hesitate on your answers, this guy will move on to another girl guaranteed.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	As far as I can see this from a single letter he wants to help you just for your presence around him. In short: he likes or love you.|`|81975db181ae9f163e24e2211db17dcdaa	He wants you to be arround him more often, and be able to spend the nite or 2 with him...but i dont think he wants you to move in entirely just yet......then again my ex moved into my house for "a week or two" when she was kicked out of her home.....she spent the next two years living with me.|`|AA11028629	If you're having too much stress at home, then move in with him for a while to help you feel better and to strengthen your relationship.    It sounds to me like he genuinely cares about about you.     Don't be scared, it should be a good thing to do and accept the holiday with him and his family.     Let him help you feel secure! It will feel better for the two of you.
gJE0ujbzaa	Yes, we women tend to read too much into many situations.    Worrying all the time about whether your man is going to cheat and so on is unhealthy, both for you, and the relationship.    You need to trust him, until he gives you reason not to.  I know some men(and women also) whose partners didn't trust them, were always hinting and sometimes outright accusing their partners of cheating. So much that they finally said "If my partner believes I'm already at it, I might as well do it and enjoy it!"    If you know he's a cheater for sure, then you have two options.  Either accept the fact that's the way he is and live with it, and be happy he still comes home to you.  Or, leave him.  There really isn't much middle ground.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	if sending some guy a picture of your boobs is making an impact, I would love to know what impact you were hoping to achieve, that sounds like his own self interests have just been met and this is not a love story.|`|wE2etBzbaa	I need no birds, I'm only interested in girls.  that's disgusting.    but sure you should be worried about sending a picture of your boobs,  hell, I would be worried if I sent picture of my boobs,  say you break up and your pictures might end up on the internet.  but now it is done, don't regret it, don't regret something done.  just don't do something stupid in the future.|`|TdPxjQDbaa	you must ask yourself some question to know exactly what things you what to see in your relation  do you take it in a serious way  or just a fun game .you should know your bf more ,because i don't think that your confident about your relation with him.|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	Some single women will make a bee line for a man already in a relationship, usually they're separated or divorced with kids.  Its not your man you need to worry about its the other women that may chase after him.

Your a sweet woman so he best treat you like one.|`|Wy47JwOQaa	I don't know why a man would speak to his wife like this in any situation.  But, I do know that getting him back will not solve anything.  When he does something that hurts you, the solution is never to hurt him back.  If you want things to be different, you create the difference.  If you want to be appreciated more, start by appreciating him.  A man will have a much harder time thinking "my wife never cleans" when his wife is repeatedly telling him how much she appreciates what he does and how he contributes to the family.    Be the change.  End the madness with you.    Don't get him back...  what do you stand to gain from that? Nothing.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Could this be about something other than cleaning?

There will always be toys laying around and laundry to do.  I agree with one of the other responders who said to stop cleaning and straightening altogether for a day or two and let him see what THAT is like.  He's got a lot of nerve saying those things to you.   Tell him that I said that if he wants a spotless house then HE can clean it.|`|MMq4asYgaa	How much is he helping out?  Do you share in the cleaning or is it all on you?  Is he volunteering to go on all these business trips or are they mandatory?
6ZfbuWaIaa	thats normal.when you care for somebody,you always want to know if he is fine and that includes the feeling that he must be doing something fishy.almost all of us feel that way so there is no cause to worry.thats normal stress and good exercise for the heart.good luck.|`|AoHuQQC1aa	you really care bout him|`|dKq0Ak4taa	your not the only one it hink its that you love him so much you dnt want anythin to be wrong nad if there is you want to fix it|`|wE2etBzbaa	you love him, but desperate and afraid he might fly away.    don't be afraid, so what if he flies away?  tons of him exist.|`|BeSteUwwaa	Its really simple, you care about him too much.

DKDzqEbMaa	You are surely not the only one    Mostly over thinking doesn't help those situations  You just have to reassure yourself that everything is good  If you have doubts about what he's doing then have a talk with him    Just write down notes in a little book that remind you that everything will be alright..  A little book of positivity :)|`|kpykP4NDaa	Beats ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Because deep down inside you know the inconvenient truth.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	i used to be like that b4... really worried abt my bf if he doesnt receive my call or somethin..  u just gotta relax a bit.. tell him to text u once in a day so that u dont worry..|`|TmjDXY9gaa	of course you're not the only one!    the reason why girls assume things are wrong, is because we actually care enough about the situation to worry obsessively in the first place.    you stress because you're plainly worried something will happen, but your mind is exploring all the possibilities, so you know there is a small chance something is likely to be wrong already.|`|HxKCvUb9aa	Cause you love him  You want to marry him  You want to have his babies    Oh La La|`|2f26fcdfc1c8b468a66c330a0d519a3faa	it seems that u don trust this guy.why don u discuss with him so that he can call u once or wtice a day or u both can work something out?|`|BGtkSLaKaa	It's our nature.

dTzYFKcMaa	of course not  :] the best sort of relationship is one where both of you can communicate with each other without feeling that the other will misunderstand of take it the wrong way.  if anything, he will most likely appreciate it and be missing you too.  there's no need to be insecure with your feelings when you're together BECAUSE you have feelings for each other  If not, then there's obviously something wrong with your relationship|`|z0e1bnaOaa	How long have you guys been going out? are you exclusive? it depends on....... but you said you see him a couple of times a week, so I assume you see him twice, three times, possibly four...... so yes if you see him four times a week and say you miss him, if you haven't been with this guy for a long time then that will be needy, if you guys have been togather for a long time and talking about getting married then it's not. But  it's all depends..... my advice is no to say it, keep yoruself busy so you don't feel alone. have great time with him when you are, more fun he has with you, more time he will want to spend with you, telling him you need more time is not a solution you want. So, rather than saying it, make him want you more. that's the way to go.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	awwww no its not needy ..... just tell him you miss him when he isnt around ..he will be pleased =)|`|O1lm79EFaa	Why would it seem needy?

It's just that you miss him!    Phone him up and tell him, see how things pan out        good luck    adam|`|NikIZsKEaa	He would be really happy to hear it. It's not needy at all. PLus in a relationship you should be honest and open. also telling him you miss him will make him happy cause it shows you are thinking about him.|`|Z4Sc1ze3aa	Trust me, that is not needy, it just means that you really like him, and tell him.  If he is any sort of boyfriend then he will understand that.    My girlfriend lives 40 minutes away from me and I miss  her a lot, and I tell her, and she does that same back, and we see each other about once or twice if we're lucky a month.    Tell him, your boyfriend will appreciate your honesty.  As for a better way to say it?, don't bother about that, just tell him after giving him your hello hug and whatever that you missed him.  But it really works well also in more close settings. e.g. when your 'cuddling', for want of a better word.  just whisper it to him. then hug him tightly    Also, make sure that you tell him that in person every now and then, nothing scares a boyfriend more in a relationship than the possibility that his girlfriend is losing interest in him or is starting to get closer to someone else.  So tell him you miss him.  It will make him feel truly loved and appreciated.    Good luck, and have a happy relationship.|`|46xTrBRyaa	No If I was Your man I would be happy that you told me that! Tell him that trust he will open up more if you do first!|`|JsffWlnEaa	no,its not needy..where is he that you only see him so little...most importantly....does he say it back...does he miss you.if not i'd be somewhat suspiscious

It's true..i gave my ex a lot of feeling and that crashed badly when she broke up. The lesson i learned is to never get attached 100% and never give 100% unless you're getting married. I've tried this out and the girls are more into you if you're not giving them 100% of your heart. It's like a fishing line...you pull then let go...you give them emotions then give them less....then a bit more when they do something for you.

I understand he's your brother, but come on, he killed your husband.  Also, wouldn't he get life in prison, not 15 years?    It really depends if you want to protect your brother.  If you forgive him, then just let it go if no one else knows about what happened (which I find really strange).  But if you really believe in what's right and wrong, it doesn't matter if he's your brother and he regrets what he did - he killed someone and that should be justified.|`|mqcVaxMvaa	in your case I recommend a murder suicide revenge situation....|`|RxBe4y3Waa	what were they fighting about? was your husband being abusive? are you italian? if you answer yes to the last 2 questions, keep this information to yourself.

Make him a home cooked meal. They say that the best way to a mans heart is his stomach. SO prepare a simple but fun dish. http://www.meals.com/ may help you. At the same time, and depending on the guy he is, make the meal taste bad purposely, if you play your cards right and make it seem like you put in tons of time and effort into trying to prepare a meal but it turned out bad anyway, then he may think it is cute and it will yield better results overall. (This technique should be used only if you can act)    2. Buy him concert tickets. If he is a guy who is really into music then tickets to see him favorite band will be perfect. You may also want to dress more spontaneously than usual, to evoke a feeling that you again really tried hard to impress him.     Really the key is just making sure that he sees that you tried really hard to get his gift to work, no matter what it was. And if he doesn't see that then maybe you should consider your relationship as a whole. Anyway, I hope things work out.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	id say condoms|`|384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	-a card with something sentimental  -plan a dinner date with him  -plan a "special night" with him|`|77YWNCV5aa	Cologne def. It's the best gift, lol.  If you know what types of clothes, shoes, or hats he wears, get him a couple. If not a gift certificate will do.

Guys like food and attention!|`|QBmFyJqmaa	well, for me i think that it is best to give him a homemade-chocolate. or you can just go buy a heart shape chocolate and pretend you made it. but i suggest you do homemade chocolate.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	beating up the guy solves nothing, the damage is already done and u can't change it. if someone cheats on u, most likely they don't love u the way u love them. can't undo it, either deal with it in a positive way such as therapy, or divorce the person.|`|XTBlOf9baa	This is a typical reaction. You feel emasculated since your wife cheated on you, so you feel the need to assert force on this man in order to attempt to feel more masculine. It's so common, but it's not going to solve anything. It doesn't change the fact that it happened, it doesn't change your relationship with your wife, it doesn't provide you with any answers, closure, solace, etc. All it's going to do is get you in trouble with the law most likely. If I were you, I'd remember that a real man doesn't feel the need to throw punches like this. And remember all the drama you're avoiding from doing that. And figure out what you're going to do with your life now. Your wife cheated on you, not the other guy.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	No.  But if my relationship with my wife wasn't already in a shambles, and he was a coworker, knew she was married, and seduced her, I might try to get him fired and/or sue him for alienation of affection.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I would love to know the reasoning behind this response to your wife's adultery.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	i like all the men's anweres that say they would beat up the guy.. its hot to have a man fight for you grrrr|`|V7grzObHaa	i don't see how beating up the guy would make matters better, just worse if you ask me.....i would be impressed by a man taking the high road by not beating this jerk up.  it takes a lot of real man to just walk away and it takes a real a****** for a man to fool around with another man's wife, plus she was the slut for cheating....from my experiences with men, violence never makes any sense. if she wants to cheat then let her, it is her loss.  i would know, i cheated on my ex husband and he acted like a real man by not beating the guy up which made me feel even worse about what i did, but i had so much more respect for him......but, that is just one cheating woman's view!|`|QtaPF83iaa	The guy didn't cheat on you... why beat him up?|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Only as a last resort. Men fight with words long before fire.|`|WqkhDIVKaa	Better make sure--even then you are looking at a lawsuit for assault & battery.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	no ..  that would be assault    but i never trust the wife again|`|1kfeghDDaa	You married your wife, not the guy. I know that you are angry with him for disrespecting you...but your wife is the one at fault as far as your marriage goes. Don't go beating up on her, just talk to her if you wish to repair your marriage. I know what you are going thru. I was mad at the other woman, she knew me, knew my kids and KNEW that he was my man, in the end though HE was my spouse not her trashy self.    Never, ever blame yourself for her being of weak mind and character.  Take care!|`|NQq7xykxaa	Beating the wife would be better.|`|zYVHWlo8aa	True Xperience. The guy got a hell of a whacking from me wen i caught them 2gather. I divorced her cos she say she loves him. A few mths later the guy left her for someone else. Guess this is retribution.....she lost her husband, son, family n friends .|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Perhaps your lack of anger management and physically abusive personality are the very reasons your wife was cheating.  You have only YOURSELF to blame.|`|OMs8tKlJaa	beat him down first, ask questions later.|`|A4T3GXnjaa	No. The relationship is between you and your wife.   He might not even know she is married!|`|g7mD94cuaa	don't go with your first impulse. beating the guy just makes things more tense and worse. it wont do any good.    edit* and yes that is a good point, have you done anything to make her cheat? are you giving her your love? or are you one of those hot head no good low life husbands?    i see no reason for people (men) to give a bad rating to this comment unless they themselves are people i described above. *smirks*|`|cRJgZMV1aa	oh hu hu, worse then that. But it would be even worse for my wife. Rope+boat+ocean+sharks+blood=dead wife.|`|EOrpDYrBaa	Damn straight! Not only that, tell them straight up that if this happens again some faces are gonna hurt... lol     Oh and dont worry beating up inst always the answer, i mean sometimes you could just be an aggressive bluffer/ shouter person guy.|`|eynaUMO8aa	he didn't cheat on you.  Make sure he knows that she is married before you punish him.  I was the "other man" once.  I had no idea that I was doing it.  I didn't know I was messing in some one's relationship.|`|d781eClkaa	I know, I know. I'm a girl. What would I know? But I do have an interesting perspective on the matter.  I would FEEL like beating the other guy up, yes. But I wouldn't feel like a "puss" if I didn't. Why?   Because violence is as old as the dawn of time and using it against someone who has somehow wronged you doesn't make you any better and it certainly won't bring your wife any closer to you. In fact, it would probably drive her to leaving you even more. The best way to resolve issues is to sit down and talk it out. Or just leave the wife if you feel completely insecure about the whole situation. As much as you love your wife, if she cheated on you, it means that you weren't worth being the only one to her and that marriage isn't a sacred institution in her mind.|`|RIO2zl1Caa	I am a woman and I would have to question the passion of a man that didn't fight for his wife if he truly loved her.|`|t3JpgI1Paa	yup I would give him an a$$ kicking like  he's never had before then dump the wife|`|qQGjRpiZaa	My best friend had this happen to him. This is what happened.    He left for work like usual. His wife kissed him bye. Got to leave work and he had his suspicions for a while. Any way he comes home and as he is walking up to his apartment he see's in the window a dude laying in his bed,watching his TV and wearing his boxers. Goes ape sH&t. Storms the apartment proceeds to beat the ever loving piss outta the guy and ties him up. Then beats him more with a phone book. Ties up the wife side by side with the bludgeoned adulterer and demands to hear everything. The wife gets up to run as the beating proceeds for the guy. He tries to stop her but ends up slamming her into the wall breaking her arm. Gets her under control and then gives her a choice between the 2 of them. Naturally she picks my friend and he unties the guy and sends him out the door with a kick to the ouchy spot. naturally the police show and he does 2 years. I don't need to explain why they divorced.     Awnser, Yes beat that ***. lesson 2 is never marry a stripper.    Just felt like sharing. The story was alot better when he told it.|`|7eBuPdwQaa	That is so stupid.  Really.  It may be your first thought, but it would be your spouse who made the choice to cheat on you first and foremost. So primal.|`|AA12325447	No, I don't think I'd waste my time.|`|AA11620807	In the wrong?  Dunno how that'd pertain 2 a guy with a cheating skank for a wife. But......       It'd depend on if the guy knew she was married, or the story she gave him.if the. Guy didn't know, or he was given some   "we r seperated" b.s.  ..... he ain't got a beating comin.    But if its some punk who knew what he was doin?  A body cast is a good reminder 4 him. Of course u DON'T hit the tramp in either case. That'd give her ammo 2 justify her act after the fact.|`|GApMPoShaa	why beat the guy when it is your wife that cheat on you?     literally in the "man's world" they'll just beat  up the guy and call it even and still keep their wife. I don't know why maybe it is an "ego" thing.|`|rsb6rEouaa	once i did, once i did not. did not feel good either way. guess that has to be answered by you. does not solve the fact that she cheated and it really does not make you feel any better about it.|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	Never...

Lef6vVQAaa	I'm sorry, but I am very blunt. You sound like every other selfish, idiotic girl out there that just thinks that the grass is greener on the other side.    Obvioulsly, boy toy number two is a player, and you get some kind of cheap excitement out of the fact that you "think' that he wants you when other girls want him.     The fact of the matter that he knows that you are engaged...and he's still after you..and you are the kind of person that will accept that into your life.    I think that maybe you should wake up and realize that there may be reasons as to why your fiance is sleeping all of the time. Maybe he is stressed out and worried about some things, like your family, you wanting to have children right away, etc.....    and, if you can't give him the respect that he needs and deserves....then you need to get out and just let him find someone that will.    Enjoy your fling with boy toy number 2. I'm sure that is all that you will get from it.    When he breaks your heart, where are you going to run to then? I guess all of the petty stuff you are whining about with your fiance will all be okay at that point when you need someone again.    Think about him. If you can't do that. Leave him alone.
UgEYBvh8aa	Fantastic. =]    If you're confident, then really accentuate that. Be really cool with her friends- or at least get along pretty decently. I like a guy who is ready to defend. Even if it's a joke! If one of my guy friends were making fun of me, I think it's really sweet when the guy I like jumps in before I can and makes a catty comment back. Humor is a huge thing, because if you can make her laugh, then you two will feel comfortable together. Just go to extra lengths to let her know that she means more to you than your other girl friends.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well first, it's more about personality than anything else. Be her friend, talk to her, let her know that you're there for her, don't tell her secrets, show her you can trust her. Be interested in the everyday crap she talks about. Ask her about her day, about her friends. This is going to get you into the friend zone for some of them, but for others...they'll start to like you.     Treat them with respect, as well - don't try to touch them. Don't call them "b1tch" of "h0" or any other dumb word like that. Don't use names like "baby" or "sweetie" unless you know they like it. If some idiot messes with her, tell him to get lost. Be a gentleman.     Hygiene is really important too - make sure you clothes are clean and neat, your nails are clean, your face isn't greasy, that kind of thing. A ton of cologne isn't necessary, though...in fact, very little is better.     And don't forget to be yourself....being fake is a big turn-off! If a girl doesnt like you the way you are, forget her!     Good luck!|`|ShLuWq1Eaa	Dude.. your overdoing it    just be cool and confident    If this girl see's that you are a good person she'll enjoy your company and want to be around u    don't show any insecurity at all, don't think things through. Just do what you feel is right|`|g7mD94cuaa	be yourself. be sweet and caring and full of charm. and have a genuine (and show) interest in her.|`|Nqns4I0laa	Well you don't want to be fake...  If you're just yourself I'm sure she'll like you well enough.|`|DJU81H31aa	british accent  hygiene
BycbT5Reaa	I'm not sure what you think he might of meant. To me, it sounds like he just wants to know how you've been doing.    Maybe you're reading into it too much because you used to like him?

The dumbass had just left a bar a few minutes before. It was about 3:30  A.M. I find it hilarious that people are so stupid and they should be laughed at.|`|rEafx4QTaa	bestiality is a terrible thing    also what would a man donkey baby look like
9qwBeYCQaa	Just tell him to be honest with you. You deserve that and so does he. If not someday the truth will come out so just get it out on the table before anyone gets hurt. It's gonna suck, but it's probably the best thing for both of you.  Maybe he just needs to talk to you, and doesn't know how to tell you what's bothering him.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	yes, he is cheating|`|PvAIY7OPaa	110% he is cheating and is a liar and your sixth sense is right.You are good to figure it in 3 months.You better run now and never look back|`|4qL7oRrVaa	I don't think you really love him... You love who he said he was, but that's obviously not who he is!    Dump the guy, whether he is lying or not, he's not respectful of you and keeps you in the dark, how can you love someone, when you don't know who they are because they aren't open and honest with you?    Move on! You probably deserve better then this. Don't ignore the red flags!|`|AA10075228	He seems like he has something to hide from you.  You probably think you love him, but what do you have to put up with to keep him?  Is he really worth all of the mystery???  Who keeps his baby and where does he live if he does not live with his child?  You have some serious reality to face in the connection with this man.  Remember, love is not sex, love is honesty, commitment, and trust.  You need some self confidence with yourself and then you will be able to go on with your life happier than you are now.|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	To be honest with you...    I don't see a real relationship between you two.  There is no trust, no open relationship just some vague understanding of each other feelings.  He does things you wonder about, you are right he is acting strange.  He makes no real effort to explain his actions or feelings and I guess you are filling in the gap he has...    You want some advice?  Move on, seek a real open relationship with someone you can trust, someone that is trustworthy that you can love undoubtedly.  Someone that you can call ALL yours.....with all your hart.    -R|`|AA11391968	More than likely he is married.   As curious as you are now, the best thing you can do is forget about him.  he does not want you to be a part of his life in the same way that you want to be a part of his.  There is no point in going to his door other than trouble.|`|BbRewQjQaa	If you know where he lives show up the next time by surprise.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	leave him before it get too serious - he's no good|`|AA12014364	I think this situation you are in stinks. You need to get out of it ASAP! Why are you wasting your time on someone so shady. His behaviour should be enough to make you fall out of love with him. Leave this guy alone and find someone else. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Good luck.|`|UcezPQcjaa	OOoooo Yes, If you know where he lives, pop up all cute, and wait for him at the door.   Or better yet- knock on the door before he gets home- You MIGHT be the affair girl- or hes cheating on you with someone else.    Dont be afraid to do it, believe me youll feel so much better.   If he is cheatin, or lyin, youll know- if not- youll know!!!    Message me if you need advice|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Too many red flags. If you know for sure he's lied to you in the past then it's time to leave him. Listen to your inner voice, if something tells you that not everything is right.... it probably isn't.|`|kUE5s9pqaa	you already know the truth ...you already answered it yourself he's "loud and a lying person"...so if he is a lair how can you believe what he says..he turns his phone off because he is involved with somebody else...let me guess your having sex with him ????please let this man go...it will only be more hurtful down the road if you don't TRUST me I know!!!!!!|`|4b273ea1bcd18de731e487c9a11bbc44aa	Trust your gut feeling. Chances are if he is acting shady then there is something wrong. Drop him before your too deep into this, find a man who doesn't lie to you someone who loves you for you and wants to talk to you every second of the day.|`|E56MF3p6aa	Well the fact is, this person is lying to you and he is 100% layer. Before is too late and before the situation hurt you. Just tell him what you want. If he is 100% sure to give you what you want then proceed with you own terms & condition. Genrally speeking this type of guys were not serious and you also should not take him serious.
AA11542500	I don't know about him, but I'm usually down to go again in a few minutes.  It's a shame he can't get you to orgasm before or at the same time, but you're right, at the very least he should get you off if he did before you.  That's what a good boyfriend would do.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	He's selfish. dump the loser.  He suffers from premature ejaculation and he sucks in bed anyway. No big loss.|`|UspK4SQBaa	No, it's not the same with all guys.  He sounds young and selfish.  Next time, insist on oral first.|`|1bab727d1cd596988cb69592228ec78caa	he is selfish and putting his own wants before you|`|Umsj08pnaa	Not all guys are like that. He seems very selfish.|`|BINKHZKtaa	Your boyfriend is just using you for sex.  I can't say that I blame him.  If he cared about you at all he'd finish you off.  I don't know any guy that wouldn't if he cared about the girl.  He's using you like an unpaid prostitute.|`|bxfInqBPaa	Haha, you got shafted, so to speak.|`|8j0KDb27aa	No this is not the case with all guys!   He sounds pretty selfish to me.  Next time ask him to help you get yours first.|`|BPtnDLu3aa	Um...how selfish of your boyfriend and NO it is not the same with all guys. v_v My boyfriend tries ridiculously hard to please me and I always try to please him. He is never selfish about his orgasms and always tries to last as long as possible to the point where he'll start going really slow or stop for a while when he feels like he's close. v_V He's absolutely wonderfully considerate even though I almost NEVER ask him to be like that.    Your boyfriend needs some schooling on how to be a boyfriend. It's not all about him. It's about you too. Geez...T_T|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	That is not fair! lols! It is definitely not the same with all guys! There are men who really want to please girls! Maybe your guy is quite inexperienced!|`|UlQpadSQaa	this is a common thing with us guys, but there is a very easy way for him to increasse the time he can go before he orgasms.  He can just "flex" his penis in sets of 5, with 1 long squeeze at the end of each set, and to do 3 to five sets a day.  this can greatly increase his penile strength and control|`|EMYlCPfuaa	no, not all guys are the same. generally they like to please theri partner.  mostguys like to see and feel the love.. maybe its time you had a little gentle talk with yours and ask what it is that hewould like to do and you gently tell him what you would like to do. maybe ou coud make a lovers game of it and make lists of each others fantasies and make up a love calendar where you both take in turns havin each others fantasies fulfilled and in this way you will get to know each other betther and know each other more intimately? just a thought..... good luck...|`|umGi6gTcaa	No it isn't! He's a selfish ***. If he loved you he'd want to satisfy you. Hubby told me he was like that with his gf's until he met me and actually cared if I enjoyed it or not.   Next time he wants some tell him he has two hands and that he should go F*ck himself.|`|muHctmaGaa	Why not have him finger or go down on you before intercourse, that way your heightened arousal could match his? Simultaneous orgasm is not as common as pornography and women's magazines will have you think, so instead you really have to insist on your own orgasm. He might be exhausted after his, which is why I suggested getting you close before instead of after.    He's being selfish, as every other poster mentioned. It probably won't be long before that attitude and behavior spills into the rest of your relationship. No matter how great you think it is right now. He's treating you badly. You have to do that girl thing, "We really need to talk about us. I'm frustrated that you won't spend a few more minutes in bed focusing on my pleasure. I enjoy sharing my body with you, I just want you to give a little in return..." Then be completely straightforward. Tell him what you want, how you want it. The longer and more evasive the conversation is, the less likely he is to pay attention.     Bottom line: you deserve to get off, or you deserve better.|`|JvbjKOqraa	Well yeah pretty much all r like that,hump hump roll over snore.NO not really,just if he isn't willing to help you out too I would know for sure he didn't love me .Cause if he did love you ,wouldn't you think he would do about anything without a problem? I don't want to ruin your thing you got going but I would sooooo give it some serious thought.Or just start getting up before he's done and say DO IT YOURSELF!  :)
71VRvldJaa	I don't think it's worth getting angry about but if he's usually home by a certain time I can see where you'd be worried.  You rang your mother in law and found out where he was so that should have stopped your worrying.  Without having a hissy fit at him, I would simply ask if he's going to do something like that after work to please be considerate enough to ring and let you know.....so you don't worry and so you know when to plan dinner.  Don't make a bit deal out of it and ruin  the evening being mad at him.|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	tell him but don't be too controlling...sometimes us men like a bit of freedom.|`|6PVFDHnzaa	being angry never helps the situation.     does he usually tell u when he goes out? if so then just ask him why he didn't txt you. if he studers then you might press the matter but otherwise i'd leave it allone|`|8j0KDb27aa	Don't be angry.  That will just push him away.  He is spending time with his step father, not another woman.  Do ask that next time he have the courtesy to at least let you know he will be late.
ZjqdLSv2aa	You never tell a girl that you might like her. If you don't like her then you wouldn't have said it in the first place. She has a good reason for interpreting it the way she did.    Simply cut off communication from her.|`|bc2Y0f2Maa	honestly, girls do a lot of gossiping and talking, dont be sad and deppressed, girls love attention, especially when it comes to having someone like them, think of it this way, girls actually like it when you like them, if you know that your not a player, then thats all that matters, just stay friends with that girl and act normal, once others see that she is still friends with you, she will lose her credibility and she could have said more worse things about you and others will not believe her anymore because she just lost her credibility by still being her friend.|`|G2K8gsKLaa	i want to slap who ever made up plz -.-
Z3a1cRL7aa	Please do not play hard to get, and do not try to trick him into thinking about you.  If you want him to think about you, give him something to think about.  Whisper in his ear that you have something to show him later, or that you can't wait to kiss him.  That will make him think about you, without messing with his head.  If he doesn't think about you, doesn't miss you when your gone and doesn't "try" after only a month, you might have landed yourself a guy who will never be what you are looking for.  But, you have to keep trying to, don't make him chase you make him want more by dropping little hints and HE will do things in return.  Love/relationships are a two way street.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	oh jesus.  You can't.|`|QSodlfMraa	its just been a month, slow down.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	by teasing the hell out of him like act like you are going to down on him then get up and walk away that type of stuff|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You're crazy.  slow down.

tmfKE8npaa	this has happened to me recently.   i think that u really like this girl.  it is difficult becuase u r such good friends because this can sometimes ruin the friendship if the other person doesnt feel the same way.   this is what happened to me. : (  do u think that she likes u aswell??  i think that if she likes u u should organize to go on a date or just get together or something and there you can tell each other how u feel.   hope all goes well mate..  cya  : )|`|5LEE91CGaa	your avatar chick is hot
MX1shAbcaa	You can't, You shouldn't  ~William
sn0V6bXAaa	3 guys? Well duh! That's simple - you create a little circle where you have your peeper in someone's butt, and the other guy has his peeper in the next butt, etc.    Edit: well yours would go into the next guy....you see? You'd all be attached because there are 3 d1cks for 3 holes.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	No you shouldn't.  Your first time shouldn't be a threesome. You'll regret it.|`|yyf2U8kjaa	be straight and get away from boys.      learn to love girls!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	if your into it, go for it.  buttt, its your virginity hun, your going to want to lose it to someone that means something to you, yah know? you want it to be a good memory.
719f2d3e7500f8b65b9f7fbe6af0a03caa	Hmmm...to me it feels better when my guy kisses me after he's shaved but there is something sexy about the not-shaved-in-a-few-days look.
Rrd4Gxvcaa	It would definitely be a shocker. Not quite sure how I would react. Initially, it might be a little weird, but I think it would be cute. It depends on how the songs are too, if they were about stalking me or something, well that is a definite no-no.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	aww..hopefully they think its cute!!  cuz i do =D|`|J2uxLxDPaa	it depends, is he single? if he is, you've got a chance! but it really depends on his reaction to when he found out the songs were about him.i'd personally think it was creative, of you, and it certainly is a great way to express your feelings. if you don't wanna tell him, then just try to think about other things to sing about. switch it up a little until you're ready.    Good luck!?|`|sMLK4hDeaa	Guys would not think its cute or weird.      They would just use it to their advantage.|`|vNzc4RnAaa	personally  i'd be shocked  then touched  then happy/excited  then think it was cute|`|2ecd714647362f82cec93773a707962daa	i would think it was very cute. just as long as they didnt involve anything that made them feel trapped or too serious. but aside from that i think that it would be very cute!!!!!|`|G4HVf7f3aa	I guess this varies person to person, but I'm sure he'd be touched ;)|`|PD9x9Oioaa	i think it's realy cute, and if he likes u at all he will be really happy.|`|AWiM2aMhaa	Man that's a tough one, honestly I think it would depend completely on how he felt about you before that...  I think if he did like you alot before that he'll be really happy and excited even though he might try to play it cool.  However if he's uncomfortable with you I'm guessing he might consider it creepy, if that's the case I'd reccommend giving him space, nobody likes to be rushed into things and calling him and texting him alot would only make it worse in that case.    Bottom line is its different for different people, but just try to gauge his reaction and if he seems ok with it you're fine, if not it doesn't mean he'll hate you or anything just make sure you don't make him uncomfortable.|`|QTgOgknaaa	didnt taylor swift write about guy she liked?|`|qtxjsjvVaa	i think it sweet to do that i wish some one did thta for me do what u have to do|`|gVO64L5daa	If he thinks of you as a sister it would probably make him feel a little weird but a lot of the time a guy will stick around a girl mainly because he likes her and is afraid to admit it|`|l01wsneiaa	Aw man, if you guys are close, then he should forgive and forget, and he should set a firm brother-sister tone with you.  just talk to him about it since he already knows
uttbqGB9aa	First of all, what you do is your business, no one should judge you.    There could be numerous reasons why your boyfriend acts that way.    Maybe he is insecure about his size and the stereo types about black men.    You shoud reassure him that he makes you feel great.  Talk to him more about your past and try to work through it.    Tell him what you have been telling us and try to get him to make you understand what is his problem with it if he's not racist.    Also, explain that back then you were experimenting with a threesome. Ask him how he feels about it. You may find a little freak in your old boy!    Good luck :)|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Guys dont like the idea of sharing their girls with other guys, & a lot of porn is two guys, one girl, therefore while they think its kinda hott, they also think its kinda trashy (no offense at all).  I honestly cant find any reason he would mind if you dated black guys, unless he is a little bit racist at heart.  a lot of people claim to not be racist, but wouldnt date people outside of their own race.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Racist, insecure, hypocrite.  It doesn't matter.  Is this the kind of person you want to be with?    P.S.- It's called your past for a reason.  Don't bring it up because it will always cause drama.|`|kzbEWqgLaa	having a three some with a 2 guys isn't bad, it just makes you a real sexual freak... lol you love sex don't you?  Tell him he needs to just get over it because it's the past and he probably has had threesomes or had sex with ppl you don't like but so what who cares it happened and there's nothing that can be done about it|`|aujHVGFiaa	He's racist and/or intimidated that you were with TWO guys when he can barely get one lady. Keep that info to yourself unless you make certain a guy isn't racist or very conservative before you talk about that stuff.|`|AA10076207	perhaps its bc he feels intimidated. he knows that bc you've been w/several other guys, he feels as though he'd be somehow less adequate than your other lovers. i don't think it has ne thing to do w/race. i *do* think that those ppl who call women whores for having lots of sexual partners r being hypocritical,bc we look at men and we're supposed to say they're real men bc they've bedded alot of women. well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. i say if you're all adults, all consenting,  and all being responsible by using condoms,go for it!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I have no idea why some men react this way to a woman's sexual history. Chances are, he's got some skeletons in his own closet that he'd not be too proud of, and besides, he has no right to judge you.     I wouldn't bother trying to figure him out. What's the point? He may not be racist, but it sounds like he's not as non-racist as you seem to think.     Also, guys like the idea of threesomes when it's them in the middle of two women that they find attractive. When it's their girlfriend in the middle of two girls, or in the middle of two guys, they don't like that so much. I personally think it's all about how much HE gets to fantasize about what you did, and he doesn't get good visuals when he pictures you with two guys.    I just ask my husband for his input, and he says that your boyfriend might have a problem with it because of the popular rumor that black men have larger penises than white men, and he may not feel that he "measures up".|`|hA6JDWsFaa	How can you not expect him to be weirded out? You had a 3way! enough said.|`|Umsj08pnaa	It's not a big deal. He shouldn't have a problem with it since it was your past. And you aren't a whore. If you were a whore, you would have been payed.|`|Uv7onQaQaa	I dont think any guy wants to hear about your kinky past sex life. Like i dont want to know about my bf's sex with his ex, and it kinda paints quite a picture for him to think about you having sex with black guys, and having 3 somes.. its just not smthg a guy rly want to think about his gf having done. your past is obviously your past, and you cant change that. i just dont know why you told him that. maybe you should keep some of those things to yourself from now on.|`|FRE2gov3aa	I actually know some guys who get stupid about that too.  Maybe because these non black guys are intimidated about the stereotype of how black guys have big pee pees. And they are scared they won't be able to please you.    By the way I don't think you're a whore.  Just a curious girl that is open to new things.|`|gWXjNa4gaa	i find it hypocritical that someone with the screen name 'scream it baby' called u a whore. u are not a whore, sweetheart. sounds to me like ur bf may be a bit jealous & slightly insecure. u probably have more sexual experience than him & he's worried about it. next time it's brought up, tell him, mistakes from the past should never be used as weapons for the present.  as for 3somes, to each their own. whatever floats ur boat, go for it|`|GemPuPFJaa	some people are just stuck in the past and hopefully he will get over the fact that u slept with black guys cause it really doesn't matter but i wouldn't go around telling the world that u had a threesome u will be judged differently|`|13uu4bbQaa	Yes it is that bad! Don't you have morals?!?  Whats wrong with sleeping with one guy at a time??    Im really surprise hes still sticking around!!!|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	maybe it's not the fact that the men were black that bothered him - maybe it was the fact that you had a sexual past period (or maybe your past was more extensive than his?).    and yes, a threesome is THAT BAD to some people (including me). it shows that you didn't have sex in a loving, committed relationship...it shows that you don't value sex at all...it's reducing sex to an animalistic act and nothing more.|`|U22nd6Aaaa	He probably feels that if you're willing to explore your sexuality with other guys like that he's going to have trouble keeping you for himself. It's very unlikely that it's a racial thing.    Alternatively he may have penis envy and think he's not going to live up to anything you've experiance because of the stereotypes about black guys|`|xzX3NSUjaa	You should have never told him anything about your sexual past. That was a big mistake. Never do that..even if the guy asks because when they ask they really don't want to know. Yes, white men hate the thought of a girl being with a black man..that's just the way it is. And no man wants to hear that his g/f had a 3 sum..especially with black men. I'm sure he has lost a lot of respect for you now that he knows about this. It makes you out to be a whore. No man wants to date a whore.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	He is probably very jealous and is having a hard time coping with your sexual past regardless of the racial differences.  I find it exceptionally hard to accept my boyfriend's sexual past.  It's very painful to think of the man I love most with another person and being touched by and touching them.  I know that it would rip me apart if i found out my boyfriend was in a threesome or something like that.  Your boyfriend is probably feeling insecure and is having immense trouble accepting this.  Talk to him about it, give him your affection and remind him that he is the only one for you and the past is the past.  It'll take a lot of work, time, and love, but eventually he'll learn to accept the past and move on!|`|b6e8a23e8ce0872697abf94a37d4524caa	I can't answer the black guy thing.    The threesome comes off as really slutty.  Why?  Because it obviously wasn't because you were really into a particular guy.  Instead you were being sexually accessible.  Guys like to feel that they are a bit special and that you don't just give it up for anyone - they like to feel a bit of pride in that you have chosen to sleep with them.  If they know you're willing to sleep with two guys at once, guys think that you don't set limits on who you sleep with, so they think you give it up for anyone and they don't feel special/pride.|`|0Pv2jt8faa	Hmm, let's not live in the past, but then again that depends on your present.    Are you willing to change for him? Do you have the self-restraint and the respect for him to be monogamous? Are you certain that this is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?    If any of these answers are "no" then either:    1. You aren't serious about this and probably are just in a phase in which you're not going to be serious for quite a long while.    or    2. You're kidding yourself and you definitely want to change, but maybe he's just not the guy you want to change with.    So, what I can do is give you some advice.    A guy, guy, girl threesome isn't THAT bad, you'll probably get hated on for it by some people but group sex is group sex, we all do crazy **** when we're young. You're responsibility right now is to decide whether or not you're ready to grow up and have a mature, responsible relationship with someone like an self-respecting adult.     And let's face it chica, (yeah, latino here too) some white guys are a little prudish and just don't understand that there are some latin women who sew their oats just as enthusiastically as their male counterparts. They're a litle old fashion (Albeit living in double standards).     Hands down, if you are willing to commit, then express this to him and if he still doesn't accept your commitment- **** that. If he does, good luck to you. Though if you aren't willing to commit then why are you worrying so much? Have fun, enjoy yourself, if he can't keep up with you then who cares? Go get someone you can have fun with. So long as you have no regrets and you aren't hurting yourself/being hurt then go wild.
e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	I usually cup his face and/or stroke his hair.  If it's more intense kissing then I the hands are kind of just caressing everywhere.   Oh wait, I love just resting my hands on his chest and wrapping my arms around his neck and just using my thumbs to rub the back of his head and neck.   So many things to do with your hands!    As far as the rest of my body goes...I love having my legs lie across his or just resting my whole body on top.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Are people this clueless that they need to ask such mundane questions.|`|zvW5rBIZaa	squeeze his @SS!  into his pants and big stick!|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	how old are you?    i dont think  i should answer your question unless i know your age.....|`|rEafx4QTaa	usually we are just focused on ur lips unless its a full on make out session. but u can do things like put a hand on the back of our head, massage the back, shoulders rub the chest, stomach. have fun|`|COJq7M4Eaa	ooh its a common question, just go with the flow, caress her or his body,|`|DytfqrkSaa	With my hands?

AA12162922	Hey, if he is honest, then try to treat him with attention. If you don't do this, then he might get irritated.    Word of advice. Try to really get to know him. Try to irritate him and see what he does (opposite of what I stated above). This will give you insight of this person. Being a Indian guy raised in America, I tend to know both cultures very well. I went to India this summer to get my sister married and I was so frustrated by the young people there.    Firstly, ask him what state he is from. "Gujarat," then you ran into a cheater. Safest state I know is "Punjab". People from Punjab are very honest. By the way, I am from Gujarat(that's where I went this summer).    While I was there, I learned the insight of the young people there. It disgusted me. They want to marry you for the citizenship status you hold. Also I learned that they are very perverted. When they go oversees for 'studies,' they tend to do things more openly then they can do back in India. Paying prostitutes, staring at girls, girlfriends, and have s**. Even there, people have s** everyday because it is like new to them. When it's time for them to get married(arranged), they dump you. Chances are they make the gf preggy, and do abortion. And don't even tell their new wives (arranged) or the parents.    In another words, the girl was just a time passing machine. Telling from personal experience and other proofs too. Too many to count. Just be safe, don't be forced into having s**.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	I suggest you be careful, very careful, you don't want your heart broken. As others have said, Indian guys only like to be with White girls for fun (most of the time). Most Indian parents frown upon dating white girls. When it time comes to get married, he won't think twice about your relationship, it will probably mean nothing to him. If he is just new to America, make sure he doesn't use you or a green card (sounds silly, but people actually do that). However, I have seen Indian and white couples get married, they are happy, and have children. Thats not the case for everyone, but just be safe. Talk your concerns out.|`|59CaFeS8aa	take bath|`|DI3GBpk9aa	Use Condom|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Yes I do.. this desi guy will f*ck you and have all the fun with you.. when you want to settle down, he will run off to india and marry the girl whom his mom chooses... you are going to get a heartbreak... leave him now if you can...|`|GHZnLiYvaa	Sure, first of all you need to make sure that this guy is really interested in you and is not just using you.After all, you know him better.The next thing is, if you feel he is a little conservative but you can still accept him the way he is and like him for that, then go for it. In simpler terms, culture is something that always makes a person create a wall around himself. So don't let that happen.Let him know what you feel about him. Overall, it doesn't matter which place a person is from, if you two are a thing, you have no reasons to worry. So just be yourself and honest as any guy would want you to be. Good luck!|`|6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Indians have changed a lot from the by gone days and the concepof the Western World is outdated. Indian boys are very much like any others around the world but possibly a litle conservative.   However - word of Caution for all inter-racial affairs be it Indian or otherwise - Probably one of the most hurtful things in life is having to deal with family and friends who are not supportive of the people you truly like and love. One might wonder what may cause family and friends to rebel against interracial dating. As explained in Verna Stolkes book entitled Marriage, Class and Color in the 19th Century Cuba, many families opposed the bonding of their loved one with someone of another race because of political reasons, religious reasons, or family pride. Apparently, many are not able to handle the conflicts and struggles brought on by family and friends. They need sanctions or permission from their parents to see if it is okay to date out of their race. The parents influential power causes them to be skeptical and doubtful about being involved in such relationship that they decide to end a perfect relationship in order to make them happy.  Good Luck>r|`|LtDeqTNiaa	If both of you click well and have the spark in you for each other, there is no problem.    My best wishes, have a blast.    Remember to keep the faith.|`|AA12324940	Just be yourself. Don't hide anything from him. If you truly like him then be as you are. Indian guys are very particular about honesty, but they forgive also easily. Depending on the views of the guy try talking to him about different things you like and gently ask him about his choices. Don't show off or flirt with other guys if he doesn't know about them.  All the best!|`|aBhsbE2saa	well falling in love is one thin...quite instinctive to be precise... But staying in love is completely a different commodity and u need to work that out, putting in some efforts... now in your case the guy is indian and you are american ...different ethics all together... you must firstly realize are u really in love with him or is it just another roller coaster ride for u.... i dont blame u but just the way americans disregard love....If you are serious ,only then you can maintain your relationship.....the thing is that your guy,may be he might not seem to u as a conventional indian folk, but deep into his core he has a sense of indian ethics... and he cannot tolerate a bitchy u for too long...coz we indians consider love sacred not a piece of **** like u people....|`|lzJJnOl2aa	I am an Indian guy and I'll tell it to you straight up.   Indian guys (especially ones from India) do not like white girls. I'm pretty sure that this guy just wants to have you for fun or something. Just like someone else said, when it comes to the time for marriage, he's gonna leave you. In Indian Culture, we believe that Indians must only get married to Indians. I don't see many Indian-White couples for this reason. I don't recommend that he will stay with you. Indian guys and their parents are pretty serious about not marrying White girls.|`|GckVXU4Paa	Well, Indian guys need some what attention and are emotional characters. They are loyal and may be shy sometimes. They wish their dates could spend most of time with them so that they can know how good is she....So, u two can always opt to go on a picnic to a hill station or any other place together on a weekend and have a wonderful evening.  All The Best.|`|051fdea29fb797012cc64278d1a50968aa	Well indian guy is just like any other guy. Does it mean if you date other guys that are not indian, they will be honest never cheat and stay loyal. Bull ****. If it doesn't work out it doesn't work out thats it. Just dont start bragging about it and believe in all the stereotype image that people potray about Indian guys.I am not saying this just because I m indian but inter racial relationships are just beautiful although sometimes they are difficult to digest!!!I wish u all the best.
oKqWOeOiaa	Tell him really serious [without arguing & yelling] what his bad habits are & tell him you want to be alone. When in reality you are letting HiM be alone to realise his own problems. Time will help you out in deciding whether he's worth it. When things start goin totally bad its better to separate for a while & work on yourself rather than "hurt yourself trying to fix a broken mirror".      --if he really loves you then he can't possibly mean what he said. by you two taking a break & not being together, you actually become closer b/c the thought & anticipation of seeing one another & not being able to is gonna make you want it more & actually create a stronger bond. trust me if he loves you, he will try his best to change & you guys can work something out.
MX1shAbcaa	Yeah, move out it will show how much he loves you  ~William

Find a more productive pastime.|`|lU8ucOpjaa	yes?|`|54ef14aee629dde270e28b8db2534f5daa	maybe thats why u are an anonymous person on the site,no contacts etc.  i like to wind people up too,and as u are 25yrs u have great need of tutorials,  i dont suffer from stress,i am a "CARRIER" i give it to other people but have no problems myself,  mad but loving it sounds like a Ronald Mcd advert,an angus burger perhaps  XD i am non too sure about "are u a Cross Dresser?",  revenge well u start out for revenge,by digging two graves,one for your enemy and one for yourself!,  if indeed you are a 25yr old woman who is bored(be that nightly or every so often,)i really could"and would Bore you to death" but as an anon e mouse and incommunicado avaniceday  ,ps you may if u wish join my fan club,i promise not to put the "block"on...i dont play cricket|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	Lol well i didnt read anybodies elses comments but yeah winding people up is fun i suppose not for the person your winding up because i hate it when people wind me up because i have quite a short temper. Just saying that, its weird, i dont really loose my temper that quick with a guy or whne im with a guy i dont seem to loose my temper with any one quickly?? I wonder why..?? as you can see im pretty random too lol, sorry i bammbled on. Altough, Im not sure i can ever recall plotting though thats a little weird. But whatever tickles ya pickle. Lol xx|`|xHYI8EfPaa	its fun to wind them up defo =)  anyone haha =)x|`|sHBPfItfaa	wooooow,   need a hobby wha?|`|MczmTftTaa	i was going to write some nasty message to see if it made u mad but i would rather tell you this is a yes.|`|j1IEm0gWaa	hey man... are you a retard?.. or did you just press any keys on the keyboard and then press ''post''|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	LOL    it is fun eh?    my buddies usually get pranked or told off and i usually laugh at them alot.|`|S4gKPOBOaa	i dont know do you use a key?|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Anyone who winds people up, and gets enjoyment out of seeing them upset, it a total complete loser who needs some serious psyciatric help.    At 25 years old, you should be working, going out, having a good time living life. Not wasting it upsetting other people just to get your sick kicks.    It's not "fun", it's painful to many people.
nOFvdF9yaa	That's your intelligence! You've understood her friendship with you eventually! Great! Now you know what to do, right?|`|VJ3Y4RwTaa	Selfish friends always let you down, just a heads up.|`|qh9EOXKOaa	Dude, don't worry about my best friend Taylor she does that to me at least once a month she just needs a break and sometimes I need a break too.|`|sHe7S3wjaa	just tell her how u feel.or you could go off ur nut at her (i wouldn't recommend it (eek)) or dont worry|`|8bplNvAQaa	Sometimes she wants her own space.  It's not her fault you'll drop everything for her.  You're just a nice person, or needy.    If you feel that strong then teach her a lesson sometime when she really needs you.  She'll get the message.  Then explain your sorry, but she does it ALL the time so you thought she'd understand.    Friends are people too.  They have needs and it's not all about you.  But when it is about you make sure you let them know.  :)|`|ZA11WBR2aa	She doesn't sound like a friend to me, you are there for her when she's bored and needs to talk to you but she's not there for you when you want to talk.
TSn6eczlaa	it's a pretty small picture, but from what i see you look fine.     you play the guitar, that's prty neat!C:|`|OiUiEMr0aa	well i would say asking here doesnt help much cause people have diference taste..som are just desperate and say ur good lookin...some are stuck up or just messed and say your a ******* goblin...but what i suggest is even if you might not look like what you want maybe you can fix some thigns...wear nicer clothes....improve your hairstyle, it can change things ALOT..did for me...be more confident...work out maybe....dont look to see if your ugly or not..that wont help at al..look to see what you can improve|`|c8nRUYrcaa	Ur not Ugly... ur pretty good.|`|e5K4pCnqaa	ur not ugly... u look pretty good
J2uxLxDPaa	it's ok, breathe boy breathe! dang, don't feel like you're already together just because you like vacation girl, feel free to check the waters before you jump in. You're not even shallow, you shouldn't be guilty, and don't think you're cheating 'cause honestly, that's laughable. Well, if girl   2 likes you, then woot! Good Luck! Trust me, when you look back on this, you'll laugh 'til it hurts!    Pat yourself on the back, you're shallow-negative! Don't be playing girls, though because like your mom, they will hunt you down and considering how many you play multiply the yelling and emotions times that. MUHAHAHA...?|`|aAv1v8Y7aa	Everybody is shallow. Get use to it, that's life.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	If  you  are  13  yrs.  old,  then  you  are  just  now  discovering  girls.  13  yrs.  old  is  way  too  young  to  be  tied  down  to  just  one  girl.  So  being  interested  in  a  number  of  girls  is  perfectly  normal  for   a  13  yr.  old  kid.  Most  boys  at  your  age  and  on  up  into  their  middle  twenties  will  want  to  "play  the  field,"  until  you  meet  that  one  special  girl  that  you  will  want  to  marry  and  settle  down  with.    You  should  not  start  a  sexual  r/s  until  you  are  married.  If  you  care  enough  about  a  girl  to  want  to  indulge  in  a  sexual  r/s ,  then  you  should  marry  her  first.  However,  marriage is  a  very  serious  thing  to  consider  and  requires  mature  responsibility;  being  a  dad  and  providing  for  your  family.  You  need  to  get  a  good  skill  or  education  first.    So,  in  the meantime,  keep  things  light  and  breezy,  free  'n  easy.  No  going  off  to  be  alone  with  each  other  so  you  can  make  out;  making  out  is  like  foreplay  in  a  marriage,  it  leads  to  sex.  Don't  go  there;  you're  not  ready  for  heavy  stuff.  If  you  do  the  wrong  things,  you  can  lose  your  freedom  very,  very  easily.  One  night  of  sin  can  ruin  your  whole  life.  Don't  let  that  happen.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	You're not shallow.  You're 13.  Need I say more?|`|05aKFYl5aa	you're not shallow, just confused.|`|3jwXB5araa	Puberty! (lmao)|`|9HzjEbd4aa	na that's just normal for your age. When you;re 16 like me, you'll want to screw every girl you come across. It's totally normal. Even Jesus went through the same thing!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I think you mean "flaky". Anyway, so you like two girls. You have every right to be interested in more than one girl! You aren't married to either of them; you aren't even technically dating them. Right? Besides, you're 13. You don't have to feel like you should be tied down to one girl anyway. Just be sure that you don't lie to either of them; don't promise one of them that you'll only be with her if you have no intention of sticking to that promise. Just have fun now, makeup your mind later :)|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You're 13 and your hormones are raging.  No need to tie yourself down to one girl.|`|rO56gv3Faa	not shallow...    your 13, who cares.|`|NqL351vyaa	not really .. just dont play girls and you fine (:|`|n195n9Avaa	You are 13 and you just like this girl who is on vacation, not like you two are dating so it is normal to be interested in another.  Plus you are at that age where you will be interested in girls.|`|ivwylzZEaa	with physical maturity will come mental maturity... ull be there soon bro|`|sY1itvPkaa	13. Pffffffffff. Stop worrying kid.|`|CyIxcsz0aa	Attraction is based on 3 main things: Proximity is one of them. When you spend a lot of time with people, you tend to like them more. Would you be as interested in someone who lived in 500 MI away? That's why coworkers and classmates hit it off.  Further more, you ARE at the age when you're hormones are going NUTS!!!! To make things worse, while I know being told you're young sucks azz its true. WHen you get older, there will (hopefully) be much more depth to relationships and attraction. But have fun and just make sure no one gets hurt!
oGoWz511aa	This is really unfortunate.  What you're describing is often the main causes of divorces in second marriages.  You're right.  The mother is the problem.  She's disturbed.  She's willing to trade the happiness and well-being of her children (quite likely for the rest of their lives), to get revenge on her ex.  And it's working!  The 10 year old is already on the path to a troubled life.  She's abusing your child, as well as her sibling.  As adults, we forgive her for being too young to handle the pressure she's under.  Sick as this may sound, she makes her mother happy when she comes home and tells her what she's done.    As the kid on the receiving end, it hurts, and it's abusive.  My sympathies for what you must be going through.      Well, you can't change their mother.  He couldn't either.  That's why they're not together.  What you have to do is have a really long talk with your husband.  HE has to be the one to get this under control.  The 10 year old may need counseling, but your husband is still going to have to be the one to set and enforce some limits with her.  Of course, these should be the exact same rules that the other two children follow.  The punishments also need to be enforced EVERY   TIME the rules are broking.  He has to be the one to do it because the child's mother has taught her to disrespect you.  The loving relationship is with her father.  She's more likely to accept punishment without resentment, and it's one less thing for her mother to complain about.  Once the child understands that certain rule need to be followed, ALL THE TIME, she'll more easily accept correction from you.       I really hope your husband works with you on this.  If he's the type to stand by and watch her do these things, without doing anything, your marriage could be in serious trouble.  If something isn't' done to help that child, she's going to grown into a bigger, stronger, abuser, with a broader vocabulary, and two parents teaching her it's acceptable behavior.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	1. You are STRESSED. That's DESSERTS, spelled backwards. Relax and take some time to remember the things about life that you love, like warm sunshine, pedicures, a lazy day in bed... whatever makes you happy.  2. Some people express different emotions through laughter. When you point out that something isn't amusing, and she continues to laugh, it may be that her "natural reaction" to embarrassment, shock, anxiety, etc., is laughter. Anytime something really horrible comes on tv, my mom laughs... I remember growing up thinking, "My mom is a sick woman. How can she laugh about a woman drowning her babies?!?" But she was laughing from disgust. Seriously.  3. Counseling is not a bad thing. Try going to your religious or spiritual leader. It's a much more informal form of counseling, and they are trained professionals.   4. You should have no contact with the girls mother. It only breeds discontent in her, and aggravates the situation. She can't fire a gun without ammunition right? So don't give her any. When the girls act like brats, let your husband handle it. Their his girls. And let him deal with EVERYTHING regarding their mother. You didn't marry her. You shouldn't have to deal with her. You married him, and his children, not his ex-wife.   GOOD LUCK!|`|5k7BexD3aa	Let your husband discuss what her problem is with her.  He needs to set boundaries and tell her to stop disrespecting you in front of the kids.|`|8YLgGtQqaa	You just go have some time to yourself, like if your husband works and your kids are at school.  I would advise you to spend that time away from them doing your favorite hobbies.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	Sounds like you need to have a family meeting and sit everyone down and explain what is happening in detail and find out from each of them what is happening with them. try and find some middle ground, it won't be easy and it may take a few meetings to get through to them|`|H1NjIT10aa	Regrettably until your husbands ex grows up and realizes the damage she is causing in her daughters by Her Attitude, there isn't a lot you can do.      You might suggest to your husband at your and his expense,  that the three of you have family counseling.  It may help but don't be surprised if it doesn't.  The Ex needs lots of counseling imho.    Sorry wish I could be of more help...  Without going to court and getting full custody of his daughters there is probably little you and he can do.|`|kNLi16C6aa	Wow, tough situation.   Good on you for being the adult in this situation, especially with the biological mother.    All you can do, is control what happens at your house. With the help of your husband. Perhaps you can ask your hubby to step in and ask for some respect from his daughter.     Can you and he both give discipline when the 10 year old plays up, is there anyway he can speak with their mother and ask that she has the same values when it comes to discipline.    But lets hope that this is just a phase, and that maturity will strike the 10 year old sooner than later!
cWy17SRnaa	You should break up with her.  She can't do what ever she wants to do.  Plus, your young you will find someone else.  Someone that will respect you.      BTW: I am 21 going on to 22 and I don't mind having sex everyday.  I am just one of those people that love sex.  You can't blame us.  Sorry.
g7mD94cuaa	she likes you trust me. im a girl. its what we do. she is to shy to talk to you, but wants you to know that she notices you. She is testing you. My advice: Go for it.|`|qtFGELxWaa	it means she likes you ask her out|`|w1iHxDL1aa	she likes you|`|EsnFmcMFaa	wow you really have no idea    she likes you go and talk to her  and skip the starring part|`|68tZ5fmWaa	How do you know she's looking at you if you haven't looked at her? You got eyes on the back of your head? And what if she's looking at a boy near you? Or a girl even? Lol|`|LEhVYWjaaa	HI THIS IS SUSHMA HERE JUST FIND OUT IS SHE LOOKING AT U DEN IT MEANS SHE LOVE'S U K AS I BEING A GIRL I TEL U SHE AS A LOT OFF CRUSH ON U BYE
TxsnvnrSaa	Whenever...thats so stupid. It doesnt matter who calls who or when.    Just call him when u miss him or wanna talk...and dont feel bad if he is busy.    Me and my g/f talk every day and every night for at least an hour! :)|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	On his birthday or just out of know where to surprise him but don't do it often because he would start thinking that you just can't stop thinking about about him that you have to call the time.
aIDlKCQAaa	I hate when girls say that! why would you think that how else could you get a BF us guys are all shallow at first we recgonize looks First! then appreciate personality 2nd. so get over your self before he leaves you for being such a drag!!|`|xWaCmo4Taa	Beautifull... And tell them to grow up :) ?|`|pLVqQI5iaa	your pretty! your boyfriends right and that girl is soo wrong.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Arent you a cutie, hey? And you have a lovely hair colour.  Ignore that girl.  Shes obviously feeling self concious about herself to have to put someone else down about their appearance.  Teenage girls are silly like that (trust, i went through it all at school).    You look lovely, and what does it matter what she says? She's nobody. What matters is what the people important to you think.|`|1a38FtEcaa	your boyfriends a great guy your lucky to have such a sweet heart you listen to him and not what girls have to say. because girls can be very cruel and mean. but you dont let them see you cry. keep your head up even when your not confident act as if you are. they only want to see you down so make sure that doesnt happen honey.|`|q41rXa1Taa	You are very pretty.  Don't listen to those other girls.  I guarantee they are saying it because they are jealous.|`|Scupj6XVaa	you are cute.  dont listen to other girls, they do that stuff when they are feeling bad about themselves.|`|gRW5X4vZaa	1) you need to learn to accept yourself for who you are--- everyone is beautiful.  2) your bf is supposed to say those things, honestly, what guy is going to tell a girl that they are ugly when they want to get with them.  3) i don't like your bf & your relationship by what you just say. it has me quite worried for you, actually. you seem emotionally unstable and he seems like the type of person who will take advantage of that for his own benefits.--- Do not give in or let him take advantage of you.  4) you have a very unique and pretty atmosphere to you, although, that picture does not express it because you have you face all scrunched up and have a weird expression taking the pic of you - typical myspace pic, i just thank you for not puckering your lips b/c those are the ones i really hate  5) enjoy life, don't spit in other's faces, find ways to flaunt your features... Good Luck!|`|FyhzmgRUaa	your cute, don't listen to her.|`|lMeoMz8Aaa	your cute as pie!  i just want to pinch your cheeks
RzeYy8dTaa	I think young people do have young love,Some times it never changes.   It is a starting point to get to know what you are looking for,You may last and mature and be together for ever.Or you don't but you leave knowing more about what you do want.  If you are honest and open You know thats what you want from the next relationship.If It isn't there and you need that you move on again.   That why if your family is disfunctional,you will pick the same type of person.It is a comfort zone.Not a healthy one.Knowing what is healthy and a good value and moral person will help you pick the same.   You are making good choices with no sex involved.Having sex gets emotions  involve that makes it hard to think clearly.Good luck I'm a mom and I know people that were high school sweet hearts.|`|nEg8crOGaa	i know how u feel n yes he can love you teens can love the question is can your love stand the test of time|`|a984cQjKaa	oh, i'm sure you really do love each other.  but unfortunately for you, teenage love doesn't last forever.  so enjoy it while you can.|`|6ZfbuWaIaa	that could be love.some call that puppy love.But whatever it is, love is for persons age 9 to 99.|`|DP7iyG4Laa	You are so cute!!    Yes hun of course you can be in love- no matter what the age is! Love is a really special thing and age has nothing to do with it. So, yeah!    Wow I really envy you cuz I'm 15 too but I've liked guys and never loved them. Wonder what it feels like! You're a lucky girl: don't let go of him!      Best of luck =)|`|BeSteUwwaa	Anything is possible.      The biggest challenge honestly is.. Change.  As you guys get older, you're going to go through changes... like goals in life.. likes..dislikes.. schools..personalities...and possibly your view about what you're looking for in a relationship might change as well.     Love is love, there is no right and wrong about.. when it happens..you know it.  Just don't let other people discourage you about finding your true love at that age..however keep what I said about "change" in mind..just incase.|`|AoHuQQC1aa	puppy luv|`|ffBXOFzhaa	well i say THUMBS UP just keep each other happy and you'l find a real solid bond.If it feels real its real!
c6d9453260fe2ba5b850c8c49d302c08aa	Supposedly......he is showing the right move which situation demands ...he cant do much anything.......its now your part to do wht he suggest if u truely love him...i can understand wht u r goin through with........u have to be strong.....it can disturb u mentally, pushing u to depression.........wait dont fall....there are many like u.....he may not be in love with u at this moment but...situation can change & i believe  it will change.....dont disown urself....its testing time for u....balance your mind..look into mirror question yourself is this wht u were expecting frm yourself...its nice felling when u fall in love......but u have to choose your priorities....|`|z5WNJkx9aa	I'm sorry to say that it sounds like you are infatuated with a boy who is simply not interested.  Apparently, he is a nice enough guy to try to help you with your studies, but he is trying to keep it strictly school related.  You can try to pursue him, but I recommend that you not do it too strongly as that will probably just push him farther away.    My recommendation, though, is that if you managed to "get back to normal" after just a week then you are probably experiencing nothing more than a crush.  If you put your mind to it, you will be able to get over him pretty quick, although it might seem to hurt a lot at first.|`|0PVOkUtcaa	you dont know how it feels to lose a friend bcoz he wants more than friendship.(believe me it hurts.)he just wants you as a friend and thats the good thing.alot of people would do anything to have that coz a friendship is more precious than just an affair(something that never takes a lifetime).youve found ur treasure,dont lose it bcoz of lust.true love understands,its patience and taking people for what they are and not what they can give or you want 4rm them.|`|cWuumdy7aa	after going through its clear he was a help to you in your studies and nothing beyond this while you are in love with him . so one way do not work. get him out of your mind.|`|59CaFeS8aa	The rose flower, cute, was on the rose in my courtyard.  I went to the flowershow at Ooty and was amazed by the types, colours and numbers.    The world out there is wide and great. Have patience and wait. Do not be hasty in selection. Should not regret later.|`|5mefi2u5aa	Take his words at face value.    "u r too young" .. he cancelled his facebook to avoid contact -- he has moved on.      I don't say this to hurt you, but to help you see in black and white what you already know.      Concentrate on the things in your life that you can control and change.  Study hard, meet new people while you do it and try to let him ease into your past.  You have a future to prepare for and he is probably not a part of it.      Take care of yourself, and live every day to the max!!|`|PUARRHzSaa	I think you are extremely lucky to have a friend who really cares for you as a good friend. I dont think you should try to propose again. Remain his friend. He could want to be more sure before committing to you.  Give him the time. He may finally decide that you may be too good for him and may decline. Be prepared for that and accept it. If he comes around to falling in love with you, you can be sure he would have done so with a lot of thought.     All the best|`|tXlvg1ahaa	The poor man is scared out of his wits for you.  He is so scared that you may find him in some way attractive and that you may want to be with him in a romantic situation.  He is so frightened that he even closed his accounts on the Web to try to get rid of you.....  Can you not see his fear?    First of all because he actually completed his collage and must have passed, and here you are, trying to impress him while not even able to spell the word.."Thought".......  No wonder he tot he has better get lost so U can't find him again....  I would do that too if ever you did that to me....  Shame.  Poor man.  Just let him be and go find some guy who also cannot spell to save his life, and hitch that one up.
QtaPF83iaa	I've been told it's very common.  I've gone through it.  I'm actually in the process of getting over it and have that loving feeling back.  I don't know why he did it but he'd say he'd never do it again then I'd catch him at an even worse limit it upset me so much I shook and seriously considered divorce.  We fought over it talked over it.  Almost resolved the issue.  I had to realize that it was a problem he had to work with and I had to be understanding but at the same time stand firm in not letting it happen whenever I caught him.   Hang in there don't give up.  It's hard to have as secure of a love when someone hurt you.  You guys can work through it tho'.  (if he's willing to work through it with you)|`|i1rDJY2aaa	He cheated, lied, and cheated again. How CAN you ever trust him again? Seriously.  Is what you want for yourself for the rest of your life? Don't you deserve to be happy?|`|iOqmoIrcaa	If you love someone, you can get over hurt feelings.  But what is the big deal about pornography.  I don't understand why women have such an issue with this.  It's nothing more than pictures.  It's not like he was sleeping around on you.  He has a healthy sexual appetite.  Big deal.  There are a lot of women who would be grateful to have such a man.|`|iD4ejChZaa	it can be recovered, with good spiritual counseling and no more lies. it's like if you don't scratch at a cut--it will heal.

But if you get rejected that fine too you tell that person that you are just kidding. like you are (teasing)|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	Either of them have to make themselves bold to get the relationship moving or else it won't work.|`|Z3a1cRL7aa	Be bold, make the first move.

F9Wqp5YMaa	it is normal to get attracted on net, because every kind of relationship based on communication. i think you should tell how you feel to him and ask what he thinks or if he feels the same about you. if he says positive things, then you both will need to discuss whether you will be able to visit each other or not. talk to him.  online relaiotnships can work even if he lives another country. it depends on the couple. if they are commited, loyal and honest each other, then it can work.|`|p3JGYWrBaa	There is nothing wrong about the internet relationship but it will be difficult since you guys are in two different countries.Is he ever going to come back? or visits at all?|`|EsnFmcMFaa	why do you want to get over him  if you like him a lot then tell him  who cares if its over the internet  i mean you did meet him before so its not bad    also maybe he feels the same way about you   and trust me if he likes you enough he will come back to you|`|yJTaBGoEaa	What's wrong with that?  Online relationships are common, and they DO work out.   If you love him, believe in that, regardless of whether its online or offline.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Sounds like your old feelings have just come back up on you because you've been speaking online.

Just take the pain until you can both be together once again and it will show you to apreciate every single second that you spend with that person|`|tluT02tvaa	No reason to be ashamed..you didn't do anything shameful so don't feel bad.Internet relationships are nothign to be embarrassed about.Why don't you just tell him your feelings? the worst he could say is he doesn't like you back,and since your both so far away you can spare your self the in-person rejection,Good luck,I'm sure things will work out.

UUx74K5Caa	In  1 the girl on the right is doing the "MySpace" face so she's out.  The one on the left is more of a natural beauty and seems more low maintenance.  She's the one on the right in  2, right?|`|oxmkllnWaa	Hi, if I was 30 years younger and single I'd go for the girl on the left in the first pic or the girl (on the right) in the 2nd... both clean and sparkly with little/no makeup. natural beauty is just hot.|`|QdnH6oyMaa	the first pic|`|X4Owk0xTaa	I'm not a guy but you are both very pretty.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	Both are pretty girls but based on only looks i'd have to go with  1!|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	You both are hot but i like the one on the right better even with the stupid look on her face.Any more pics?|`|AOUyJhoNaa	I'm not a guy, but they're both really pretty.
dmqVzSZKaa	no it's not true. people gain weight for various reasons, not just because they graduate high school|`|Umsj08pnaa	Most likely college; most students can't afford good, healthy food. Plus, as you get older your metabolism changes.|`|DS33Wl4waa	Yes, the head cheerleader in my class who was hot and popular ballooned up quite a bit. Maybe she had kids, I don't know|`|yJTaBGoEaa	No this is not true.  Anyone can get fat at anytime regardless of their sex.  So grow up, and realize the world doesn't revolve around weight and only weight!|`|7YHmkdfXaa	It can go both ways. After highschool your life style changes, some people become more healthy, others become less. There are those who go off to college and just drink all the time and party, they are bound to gain some weight. Not to mention people metabolism slow as they get older too, and without anything regulating excersise meaning PE or gym class, well you get my point. I've noticed the same thing with half of the "hot" girls that I went to high school with.|`|DXdMMrAcaa	Yes. It is true.  A lot of girls are less active, and more stressed out.  This can lead to eating more and exercising less.  Some girls just let themselves go because they don't have to adhere to the society of high school anymore.  I know a LOT of girls in my grade gained significant amount weight since graduating.  I on the other hand was chunky in high school an have lost a lot of weight without even trying.  I have no idea why.|`|D4oVe5guaa	They call it the "freshman 15" in reference to the at least 15 lbs. they put on when they go to college.|`|bb8813d6bca81de234195f3347ffb748aa	this happened to me!! I graduated back in 06 and gained 30lbs since then. I blame it on my lifestyle change. when I was at home I had a set time to eat dinner and a set time to go to bed. now that i'm in college I eat when I can and sleep when I can and sometimes I eat and go to sleep! not good for you but everything changed for me once I hit college but then again, I see some of my freinds from school now and they have lost a lot of weight; it really just depends on the person.
SDzPeqSLaa	Wow, are you living my life?? Trust me, we have a LOT in common, all I can say is when you've had enough you'll know.  No one can decide that but you.  I know there aren't that many eligible men out there, but please don't settle, because you will regret it.  So what he's gorgeous, he's a liability not an asset! Trust me, i'd rather take an ok looking but a great guy, than a gorgeous jerk!  And trust me, he can find a place to go, sometimes we tend to 'mother' guys and worry about them more than we worry about ourselves.  Where did he live before he met you? Believe me, theres always going to be another woman who he can 'live with' like he has with you.  You need someone to help build you up, not cheat on you and bring you down.    I do know that if you leave him, it's going to be painful, if you stay with him it's going to be painful, BUT if you do leave, the pain will stop eventually, if you stay you'll always be miserable and in pain.  He's just making it hard for your true soulmate to come in to your life.  It's going to be hard and lonely if you do decide to leave him, but peace of mind is worth more than any man.  Good luck! Hope this helps.|`|3153c685999f74998bcfed30ba78ea5eaa	for the mean time i guess you have to part ways, for both of you to assess the situation, alone. after doing that, try to talk again, if both of you concluded that its time to part ways then so be it but if one of you is still hanging on, then dont. Married life is not easy.  Its not about finding your soulmate, your everlasting lover, its about commitment.  You cannot expect people to change overnight and you cant see that he's changed if you will not give him the chance.    Everything can be talked about. I hope everything turns out ok for both of you.|`|g5Orpmnpaa	Your heart is broken and he betray the trust u had with him. If he loved you he wouldnt have ever lay eyes on another woman, but he did so it show that he doesnt love you. Im sorry but I know u prob dont want to leave him. You want things to go back like it was, but the thing is it wont come back, because he cheated it shows that he doesnt love you. He broken your trust and so you must move on, and as for the verbal abuse. No! Get him out of the house! If he verbally abuses you now he might actually try to hit you if he is angry enough. Please! For your own safety you must get rid of this man! You shouldnt talk to you like that! You should be happy with him not miserable! Get rif of this man! Even if it hurts, even if he calls u and says he loves you. He doesnt! He is using you. Heres how I know.    1: If he loves you he would of never cheated on you!  2: If he loved you he would of not verbally abuse you!  3: If he loved you he would show u more respect!  4: If he loved you he would try to help you with the bills!       See this man doesnt love you he is using you! This man isnt even a man. He is a child that needs to grow up and start acting like a man should act!  You need to get rid of him and if he gets angry at u when u bring it up. Bring a friend with u or 2 or 3 because if he verbally abuse u I think this guy would hit u if he had the chance. So please be prepare when ur going to say it. Like bring people with u and let them stay somewhere close and if anything happens they can help you. Seriously though I know your hurting but its over now. You cant trust him, you dont have that connection like u once did. The best thing you can do now is move on. Good Luck to you|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Just leave him because you deserve someone better then a lying cheating abusive jerk.    You are only in your 40's and have plenty of time to meet a guy who will love and respect you.|`|Q8L7NWjwaa	Well if you want your downward spiral to end & pick up... you gotta go!  Seriously!  I know of men such as yours... gorgeous (not hardly perfect) that womanize like that!  They've been lovingly dubbed man whores!  True story~one guy I know is married (pretty boy no less) and it is all around common knowledge that he has many mistresses!  He's so good looking that women flock to him with no regard to the possibility of an existing relationship girlfriend or wife.    Come on... he's done it before & promised never to do it again... tells you to get over it blah blah blah????  You need someone here to direct you?|`|AA11371251	move on you deserve better and your right there is a soul mate out there waiting to find you and you need to make sure you are available. Life is too short to waste in on people who make it miserable.|`|B6NMzKaGaa	Follow your heart,it sounds like you feel that you should get out of that relationship while you can.  He sounds like a leech to me.Good Luck|`|iD4ejChZaa	40 is young, he'll have to go, he's a drain on you. soo--make a plan, tell him you 2 can split up nicely or not so nicely, it's up to him,     tell him you want your independence back, you plan to get back on your feet and then travel----    like i said 40 is not old-but look at your 5 yr. plan, then your 10 year.  no, you're not quite in hell, but leave it up to him and you'll both be homeless. like they say; '' a person can be young and poor but you can't be old and poor'.    p.s. plus he cheated?  i would forgive once, but you don't need this kind of baggage.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he isn't showing remorse, and doesn't know or care that what he did hurt u, it is time to end it,when this happens u move on even if your not sure where life is going to take u, life always takes u somewhere, and life usually gets better. takes more than looks to make a good relationship, u can have the most handsome man in the world and still be unhappy. its whats in a man's heart that counts.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	If you don't feel that you shouldn't be together any more then maybe it is time to let go.  I know it sounds really hard because you are not financially ready to be on your own but if he is going to keep putting you in a deeper hole then you've got to get away.  It's scary to be alone when you haven't for a while but like you said you could miss out on the guy of your dreams becasuse your scared to make the wrong move.  if you don't feel a connection with him anymore you are wasting your time....  good luck and if you ever need someone to talk to check out my profile|`|gWXjNa4gaa	um he cheated? relationship over!! not only did he break the trust bond, he was unfaithful physically & emotionally & by staying with him, ur telling him it's ok to cheat. i'll forgive u & torture myself the rest of my life.  seriously, friend. leave. now. find yourself again. learn to trust again. cuz believe me, if u don't, ull never trust another single guy & it's not fair for all future men to be punished for this assholes mistake|`|ZVb8azf2aa	It doesn't sound like you spend a single day not looking over your shoulder wondering when he's going to cheat again.  Squandering your  own self worth and losing all your financial assets in the process.  You're hurt in so many ways, is having someone around so you don't have to be alone worth all the hurt he's caused? And all the hurt he will inevitably cause in the future?  You deserve more.  Do what you got to do and find someone who will appreciate you and not take advantage of your kindness.|`|x5R1zUtraa	Okay, Wow. Well, I'm not to clear, If you two are still together, GET AWAY FROM HIM! He's caused you all this grief, Financially wise, verbally, and mentally. He CHEATED on YOU. He basically told you that, your not good enough, and a 'sorry I will never do that again' will never help,he's already broken that bond between you two. Even if he's the most best looking man, he's caused you grief, and you'll get a lot better, you just have to find one.  Okay a few suggestions.   - Kick him out. You need to get your head in the game. If he's with you, you'll just dig yourself a bigger hole, for YOU (not him), YOU, to dig yourself out of.     So as soon as possible, watch what you spend, and watch shows like 'Till Debt Do Us Part', shows like that, Get those ideas to help you.|`|AA12325447	Many people stay together out of fear of the unknown.  It truly is a roll of the dice.  However, if you leave and all your situation goes further down hill, how long would it take for you to find another "major azzhole/jerk" - those guys are everywhere.  I dig up every piece of self-confidence and motivation you can gather and go for it.  If you don't you might always be asking yourself -- What if ?    Good Luck!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Once they cheat, they cheat again. Especially when a gullible spouse takes them back. That's like saying it was ok to begin with. They know it was ok once, it will be ok again.|`|1kfeghDDaa	You live once. What will your life-story be about? The affair has destroyed a part of you and how your feel towards your guy. You have to be the one to decide whether to stay or go. DO NOT let fear allow you to stay miserable or to not have an opened mind about your relationship. Some are genuinely sorry for what they have done. Some....stop for a lil bit and then are at it again.    Many women have been right where you are and are happy with their decision. Be strong and I hope that everything works out for you.|`|AA11996507	You write this big long paragraph all about why this guy is bad news, and then you ask what you should do?  Isn't it obvious?  You have been miserable for a year already.  How much more time do you want to waste?|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	ITS SOO OBVIOUS LEAVE HIM HE RUINED YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN DO SOO MUCH MORE BETTER FORGET THAT LOSER|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Alright I didn't read all of this but I got through the first few sentences.    Answer is you should leave him.  Your unhappy and by the sounds of it he messed up pretty badly.  So leave him and call it what it was.  A good relationship until he cheated on you.|`|1oDwKgSmaa	sounds just like me... well, tell him you need some time and he should go. Just do it and don't worry about the rest. It all ways works out, in the strangest ways! When he cheated and left, I asked him to help me pay the rent for 3 months until our renting contract expired. He said he would, but did he? NO! And did I survive? Oh, YES I did. Still don't know how, but I did! All the furniture was his and he took it, I did not even have a couch. The place was empty! I took the last 2 furniture peaces he left to pick up later, because he did not keep is promise with the lease. And my place looks awesome now, just the way that I want it - and never could because 'he does not like the style...' blah blah... And did he come crawling back to me? OH, YES he did...  and does he stay with me now? OH, NO! He can look after himself until the day he asks me to marry him. I won't go through that kind of thing again! (more than 1/2 of my salary goes into the rent) We are survivors my friend! Just do it!!!     Good luck! xxx

vG7p6pD9aa	Maybe he might not come across shy, and i dont come across shy. But when it comes to bringing something up for the first time and mentioning it without no other conversation about it being brought up i hate it!  Be confident, and just throw some hints in. And get his number aswell so, if you really do feel shy about saying it to his face you can give him a call or a text.  To say this :)|`|a5a50191dfc01b41eb49850adcd033d5aa	dont worry he's just shy as i used to be with my girlfriends but i gave up being shy and asked to take 1 to date u also ask him and he would be happy|`|ee848a7773b60e221c2a6656b84b5759aa	I think you already did the diffecult part by sending this letter.

If refuses, he has no interest in u|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	If you have the money for a Valentine's gift, why not ask him to share a soda or cone after school, your treat, you have something you need to discuss with him. It sounds corny, but it'd give you a chance to get him alone if he says 'yes', and a 'no' under those circumstances isn't as embarassing. Also, he might say 'no', but take a raincheck, meaning he's interested, but doesn't have the time right now.    Remember, a guy can be shy with girls, when he isn't in other situations... can depend on how much experience he has. Also consider you are in high school (I presume) and with the economy and his age, he might be intimidated with the idea of how much a date might cost, what you meant by going out. He might want to get to know you, but has limited resources and is embarassed by it.

If he feels like you're too much work, then he's not worth your trouble.    Sex is not the foundation of a relationship, it's more like the icing to a cake...and icing is really gross all by its self.       ..unless it's whipped cream icing then: NOM NOM NOM.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	u should b a nun|`|XR0VnlXjaa	Maybe you're afraid of the after math of engaging in sex?

64j0k4wTaa	I seriously doubt if she'll have an orgasm the first time.  So hate to tell you this, but the ONLY way to make it extra special is by how you treat her emotionally before, during, and especially after.  You'll have to be extra compassionate and caring towards her all along, and especially after.. cuz you won't just be screwing with her physically.. if you know what I mean.    Just be very in tune and attentive to her feelings.  Try to have her communicate with you all along.  Plan a date that's really romantic.. so she knows that she's special to you.|`|EMYlCPfuaa	well if that were me... i would like it slow, tender, gentle,  passinate and an orgasm first is proably est so that it s remembered forever with the pain being between the first andl alst orasms...mmmmmmmmmmm|`|oKqWOeOiaa	make sure you please her first. especially orally. remember us women can have MULTiPLE orgasms. it gets better with each one so its best to "do the deed" after she's had a few. sometimes us females crave it more after an orgasm. it just feels better & it becomes more intense & passionate. take it slow & kiss her everywhere.    make sure the room is very nice & sensual [candles, rose petals, silk sheets, w/e] you want her first time to be the unforgettable. oh yea & you bein the guy make sure you wrap it up ;]|`|f1eMHsoLaa	DONT WANNA THINK ABOUT IT|`|68msDkYUaa	just go ahead coz youcan never plan such things.... if you enjoy it then thats all that matters|`|eQWAVpDXaa	.....?|`|OMn4dxEaaa	ask her|`|x9PQQGybaa	personally, i would wait until marriage because then i would know that guy is the person im truly in love with and want to cherish and spend my life with..and also give him something precious and special that i will never get back...my virginity...but if u guys r absolutely positively ready then i say do wat feel right to u..if something inside is tellin u dont do it..then plz dont..thats ur conscience talkin to u..if its tellin u that its the right time then go for it if u want..but i think u guys should sit down and talk about it first so u and definately her makes sure u guys dont do somethin that u and most likely her will regret..  [oh p.s. pleeaassee be gentle with her..take it very slow and ask her how it feels.. u dont want to hurt her!! lol..if she in uncomfortable and she wants to stop then stop..but if she wants to keep going then go right head and keep doin wat u do..before u guys start u may want to talk to her..tell her u love her [u must obviously do if u are willing to take her virginity]  make her feel nice emotionally and mentally..kiss her hug her hold her make her feel good physically too..eventually u guys will get in the mood and start to do ur thing..make it passionate and romantic and meaningful just make her feel special and beautiful..] i reaaalllyyyyy hope this helps! =D
gJD6AvpFaa	Nobody is perfect in the world... If u r lacking in some field u might be terrific in other field which others r lacking.. this is a universal law.. so there is no point of any envy.. Be happy with what we have.. dnt compare urself with anybody... coz its not wise to compare with two dissimilar things.. stick 2 ur individuality.. that will give u more confident n find which is ur field that u shine...........|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Then why dont you go out with him?|`|T3TDOoGPaa	yes gradually envy will change into love.as u said he was brilliant and nice u were really praising him when u were asking the qustion.the piont which i am conveying is that u already adore him.|`|xii6SDjkaa	Maybe your just so in love with yourself and the thought of him liking you, you wish you were in his place liking yourself. You wish you could be with yourself!|`|UhK363oJaa	what?|`|Uv7onQaQaa	I know what you mean.. i envy any guy who gets me too ;)  but in all honesty it's really good to want to be with someone you admire, i think envy is more insinuating your jealous of his talents, and like dislike him for it... since you like him too i think you should just be happy he has a crush on you, and you can potentially be with someone you look up to.. and can learn and grow from :D|`|OD9NHpaVaa	you envy him if u are way over his league.    you bad girl!
GBr9YngTaa	You're still very young. Yes it's okay. Take your time, rushing things may hurt the relationship. When I was fourteen I never really did anything either. I just liked having this person to talk to and share how I felt towards him. I thought it was pretty tacky to make out or have sex that young. You're in a good position.|`|u70TaWI5aa	Well sometimes relationships are that way. I had a friend whom was going out with his girlfriend at the time and they did not kiss for 3 months. At that time we were around 16. I went with him and his girlfriends sister and me and the sister made out before them in a relationship ever did. Sometimes people like to take it very slow and there is nothing wrong with that. If you want to kiss, then you can make the move it is not a bad thing to do so. But don't worry it does not mean anything bad by you not kissing. It will happen eventually.|`|fMEypXDYaa	your still young, but a kiss isn't out of the question, just ask him to give you one so you both will see what it is like, that is all your really seeking right now and no harm in of it self.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	hes either really prude and shy kiss him! or maybe he is gay is he kind of feminine at all? just lay one on him, guys like that|`|9RajlJpRaa	its ok- things happen when they are supposed to :)|`|AATmqYQ1aa	WOW! I wish other kids would be as responsible are you two are. That is great to hear!    No, there is nothing wrong with your relationship, you are just thinking with your brain and know that you need to take things slow.    Good luck with everything, you guys are going to be just fine.|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	ur WAY too young to have sex or anything, just kiss him, but try to control urselves.  because if u let him go to far, ull want what he wants|`|u72QPS8jaa	you guys are still young and 3 months is quite along time so i think that even the sight of you or just your presence next to him makes him happy and he likes you so much hes satisfied just by that    when you guys are ready things will start to deepen so dont worry remember you guys are still so young!theres plently of time for things to happen :) goodluck
d68fcba8d2d9be865acddf103d499bd1aa	From a guy telling a guy not to do that.    It would be weird unless you know she is your friend or is already into you.    You should start with just putting you hand on her shoulder and watch her reaction.  If she responds to you by touching you back in any way or not moving away after you do touch her, you now have permission to do it again, but not more until she gives you a sign that she is comfortable with your approach.    Putting your arm around anyone without first knowing where your relationship is at (and I mean even friends) is getting in their personal space and that takes time and knowing what they are comfortable with.    Good luck|`|yeYL8Udoaa	its not weird ok,,,      ????? ???? ???  ALAH ALAH ALAH    its not weird ok,,,|`|zRmwEFAwaa	I would consider it myself, really ahh...um...hehe.....OMG. Make sense? BUT that's just me, lower self esteem, never got a guy (well, didn't intend anyway).|`|wE2etBzbaa	No sorry, you have a dick. no|`|UyULJUx1aa	I might think it was weird...depending on how well I knew you...if I had like just met you five minutes ago, yeah, I'd think that was weird.|`|WNskx1JGaa	That is not weird. It is actually normal!!! But for it would depend on the relationship between you and I. If I know you well enough for me to be comfortable with you putting your shoulder around me then I would accept that.    If you know her well and you both have a great friendship then just do it. She wont move it or try to back off trust me, its no big deal. Just be confident and dont be nervous or start shaking or anything similar to that.    Good Luck  ;-)|`|44d4dc2925ed446e539c8fbc67feb9fbaa	I would get so horney|`|6boH5X5Baa	no i wouldn't think it was weird|`|zqVx3Yfjaa	Very in fact she might put an avo on you or rick ur balls of em feed them to ginne pigs|`|jo9p0jBwaa	I love it when one of my guy friends or a guy that I have a bit of interest in does that, although if the girl is clearly not into you, don't do it. It will only creep her out if she's not looking for it.|`|ucr4J8kcaa	To me it depends on the guy. If I think he's cute and he shows me a little kindness, I find it really sweet. If he acts weird around me or is not someone I find attractive, I find it a little weird and it usually just pushes me away more.|`|ccgcJ9PKaa	its not weird guys do it to me all the time and its not weird of one 'accidentally' fell on you coz it happened to me and a guy kissed me on the cheek lmfao!! WE're just friends now anyway|`|cCgWGnwWaa	if you're hot it's fine. nah, it depends on how close you are with the chick. my guy friends do that to me and crap when we're talking, but if we're a lone and he's doing that we usually like each other.
Z3a1cRL7aa	Sex is supposed to get better with age, and even then it could be that you do not orgasm from penetration.  The majority of women's orgasms come from the clitoris, which is why you are more successful with masturbation.  If you want to orgasm from intercourse, either get your hand down there and rub your clit or have him wear a vibrating c-ring.  They sell them at Wal-Mart now, but you could get a better one online or at a sex shop.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	some women need genital touching while they are having sex to get off.|`|vXOreO4Uaa	Whoah. Well i felt the same way but it was because the guy   had it so tiny.|`|1FAggU5Zaa	okay its because ur still young they say that a good age to have sex is when ur like 18 or 20 cux u passed puberty... me 2 i didnt feel s.h.i.t when i was like ur age till i was like 18 i think...|`|5haXKcIuaa	women have to use their mind alot in sex and maybe your not so focused and into it. maybe try somehting different and exciting to help u both out abit tlak to him about ur problem and u both have figure somehting out to mak eit pleasureable for both of you.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	You need some oral action down there. Tell him to use his fingers or tounge. um msg me b/c I have a good tip for you you should try and will work. ; )|`|FjwdmI0oaa	He is young and  does not know what he is doing.You pleasure your self because you know what feels good to you. You really need to be using condoms because you can get some STDs that will mess up how good it can feel for ever.|`|C28tF09Faa	At that age I masturbated and that was more fun.....sex did nothing for me....but growing older and having more sex and other partners i have found out what works for me. Don't worry sweetie...it will come to you after a few more years or other partners. be patient but enjoy masturbating in the mean time .Good luck|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Maybe he doesnt know the love secrets.  Cliturous and Anal are a couple things to experiment with|`|d40k56HHaa	I was 15 the first time I had sex so don't worry I wont say a word about your age, but I think its your age really sex does get better with age like a fine wine.|`|XR0VnlXjaa	I'm 24...when I was your age, sex wasn't at all so great either.  It'll get better in time.  If anything, maybe try to have some sex spontaneously, and try not to masturbate.  When I don't, sex feels better.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	You need to relax more and try to actually enjoy it. Sounds like you get bored easily too. Try more foreplay until you get so worked up you need sex.Also, a lot of it is mental..relaxing, feeling comfortable, thinking about something that really turns you on. Try telling him what you like and how you like it too..it might help.|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	Have you tried oral sex?  Many women don't even experience an orgasm until their mid-20's.  Also, 60 percent of women can only achieve orgasm through direct stimulation of the clitoris.  If you can experience orgasm when you're masturbating, then try him giving you oral.  Just feel it out and guide him in the direction you feel is the most pleasurable.  If you're worried about him being awkward, just know that 99.9% of guys will do ANYTHING do get their girl to orgasm because it's a major ego boost.|`|qHDkCC2Caa	I used to not feel pleasure as well and would always have to fake the pleasure and even fake an orgasm just hoping that maybe if the guy thought i was enjoying it he'd do something different and maybe it would become more pleasurable. It didn't. However, now I'm older and the truth is the truth....older, more mature men really are better and know what they are doing. And they just got some tricks up their sleeve and theyll let ya enjoy it, I promise! So I'm not saying go find yourself an older guy, just keep doin it now....but then in a few years.... you will see!|`|oKqWOeOiaa	You need Clitoral Stimulation.|`|Vzr871xsaa	spend a night with me thats the solution to this question|`|gv7unj2Waa	its simple baby...you just aint doing it right...|`|FBhQU5tBaa	maybe cuz sice you have sex a lot you see it more like a routine.. or youre just no into him...|`|kMpgMplmaa	ok maybe you guys should start of with foreplay, if that doesnt work from missionary have your legs closed and his open on the outside of you, and have him lean forward while in you to stimulate you cl!t. If that doesnt work  just make him give you oral. it wont kill him|`|HoVMBPqTaa	If you don't feel pleasure it's not because of what you're doing it's because of what he is NOT doing. You guys are young and my guess is that you haven't had enough experience learning all the ins and outs of sex.  There're many way to get sexually stimulated - the secret is, to each their own.  He needs to explore your sexual, intimate secrets,  where and what feels good to you, and you need to direct him. It take time and exploration. For now just enjoy what you know.  In time you'll get better, it takes time and maturity.|`|IinVLhoMaa	My best guess is that at sixteen you don't know anything about love making and all you know about sex is what the porno stars do. Women need to be aroused for intercourse and I'm not talking about just being wet. I mean completely aroused, both mentally and physically, to the point where a single touch makes you tingle. The reason masturbation probably works for you is because it is in your head and it is what you like, you've led yourself to where ever your fantasy has taken you. An orgasm for a woman doesn't start in the bedroom. It starts on the date, how you've spent your day, etc. If youre sneaking around to have sex you won't be very comfortable and your mind won't allow you to reach your peak of arousal.|`|2OUUr1pwaa	try more foreplay .
xEBNAlksaa	You should totally go!! Theyre mucho fun!!! U used to go to auditions all the time just for fun, and I always got call backs ven tho there were so many girls there that were prettier then me.

But it's not clear cause you wear a black spectacles there in your photo. So, can't see what your face likes. But, if you really want to be a model, then try to raise your ambition as high as you can. You can buy the medicine for acne. It's okay. You can try it! If you're fail, it's okay right? Nobody will tease you, cause you have tried hard! You should try to make your dreams comes true. Good luck! I know you can be a good model.|`|eW41wwCPaa	Just wear something to cover it up and bring some pictures of you ?|`|VSzF36Ywaa	Don't go.

Legit agencies usually don't have these huge audition events that you hear advertised on your local radio station.     But, there's no harm in going and seeing what's up. Just don't let them take any money from you!|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	I think you're hot. But you shouldn't take pics from your mirror, get sum1 else to do it.    Though you may have a disadvantage coz of the stuff you described there is some stuff you can do to get an edge over other contestants. Maybe try to master some of the catwalk walks so that you take attention away from the things you are insecyre about. BE CONFIDENT, they pick up on that big time and it will help alot.    Don'tlet silly things stop you from going for your dreams, is obama followed such talk he would not be president. Do you really want to be a bitter old lady grumbling about how you should have at least tried? GO FOR IT!!!!    Good luck!|`|l9qCBTqHaa	First and foremost thing ... Modelling interviews are not decided on one's looks if you have a right attitude, confidence, brain ,self-respect you should go for it .. since you wanted to be a modell from a very young age and you are willing to do everything for your dream .. even if you fail the interview . you woudn't regret that you lost the chance to appear.                           If you are standing by the river and dont know to swim. You will never be able to swim .. so just take blessings of GOD and jump into the river.

Just Go For It ...|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	no you are not the type|`|YrW8QwVjaa	Go for it your gorgeous babe!|`|uW1jJjMvaa	I would go you are a very pretty girl.

It was a good opportunity for her. Good Luck and you have a great chance.
TjCA8T0Uaa	What are you, 13 years old? Make small talk and don't think about it dramatically. Pretend as if you are talking to a friend, and eventually you'll feel comfortable around her and you'll be able to ask her out or something.    If you really are having trouble, create a problem (Key note: w/o her knowing that you created it), and solve it for her. Classic Damsel in Distress. Of course now you're just on a crash course for lying to her.|`|ZaPj1OIbaa	girls are just as freaked out as guys if not way more. You can't really break it down, just try not to freak, calm nyourself down when you see him/her walking towards you.|`|FtRZpUkMaa	when my boyfriend and i first started dating we were sooo nervous, the both of us.  i could even feel him shake sometimes he was so nervous, but eventually we became comfortable and less shy.  now we can share anything with each other with no added awkwardness.  so i'd say spending a lot of time together usually fixes the nervous thing.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	yeah, but not as much as you guys. You guys can get pretty bad.|`|quM6eMT6aa	YES, just be yourself|`|wE2etBzbaa	guys are not suppose to be shy and nervous around girls.   plug your balls|`|t2SGVG1Vaa	absolutely 100% yes.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Definatley are girls nervous, well it actually depends on the girl. Personally I am always extremeley nervous. I feel like dieing even after sending my crush an IM and it's even worse in person. For example just asking my crush to borrow paper in class, I would have to wait a good few minutes before I was sure I could do so without making a fool of myself.  I have yet to figure out how to break down that blockade but I maybe would recommend maybe just rememebering that she is any other person, but just keep the flirty comments coming.  Good luck!|`|oc0pCUhyaa	definitely  and i suppose you've just got to convince yourself that their are worse things than embarrassment|`|Du6O1CrZaa	with a gun|`|Q8etYn60aa	Definately!  It's hard to break down the blockade, but it should help at least a little bit to know that she's probably just as nervous as you are.  Seriously though.|`|u72QPS8jaa	talking always eases the tension lol  and yes girls probably get more nervous than guys find out what she likes and talk about it!trust me that always works!|`|ZlgRne3caa	Oh my gosh- I get SO nervous around guys I like.

Y4Pr3s7Jaa	It is right that marriages made in heaven but people are not wise enough to handle and manage the relationship because of their personal egos and many more things.|`|iD4ejChZaa	because we do not live as man and wife as God intended, we can but most don't. with total love and reverance for God, respect and consideration for one another, etc. husbands truely ''loving their wives as they love themselves'' and wives ''submitting unto their husband'',     that is what God intended for marriage. each joyfully and lovingly putting the other's needs first, patience, kindness, truthfulness, etc. it is possible, i've seen it done. However we let sin creep in, pridefulness, selfishness, inlaws, lying, cheating, laziness, sarcasim, etc. not to mention porn and profanity. You shouldn't even let the chidlren come between you in a marriage.|`|8wHg5MECaa	Marriages are not made in heaven. None aware of heaven.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	most marriages are made by people, not "in heaven."|`|cgb4WOnVaa	Actually, the quote you're looking for is "a match made in heaven" - and when used, it usually reflects the hopes of the observer, not the actual facts of the union.|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	Yes, marriages are made in heaven. God knows who will be married to wholm after 1000 years too. If selection of the life partner is good & suitable, they enjoy married life almost daily like enjoying in heaven. Most of God fearing persons do have such joy. Divorce rate is not as high as it has been made out to be but in last two centuries it increased greatly b coz of  degradation in faith in God & deterioration of people's characters & morality in some selected sections of societies, not all,  not b coz of marriage system itself. There is NO better replacement of marriage for happiest possible satisfied , organised & civilised life.|`|UAXHmqgRaa	Marriage is FOREVER!!!!! Until death do us part, when you take those vows you are bound to that person and in the eyes of God you exsist as one. I doesn't matter what a paper says You are divorce, in the eyes of God you were bound and you are one. Also the reason that divorce rates are so high is that our world is full of corruption. There are same sex marriages, and ppl having more then one partner, and so forth. Pure corruption, people don't value the meaning of Marriage anymore.|`|AA12325447	They also say girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice.    It's all a bunch of crap to make people believe it's the right thing to do.|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	yes marriage are made in heaven but we people do not beleive thics now a days and that is why divorce happens|`|ZEhoAGH6aa	its all ur karma.|`|H25kJXYDaa	Because of Indian legal system and National Women's Commission which encourages women to file false cases against their husband and in-laws Indian Penal Code and DV act. after which case of divorce. The women are lured to file these cases by the lawyers and police telling them they can extract a huge sum of money from the husband. So the womens are filing divorce to earn money and they are doing business. The national womens commision has made IPC 498a a source of income for girls.|`|4TD2rdG1aa	i believe in it.  and also believe that whatever time we spend with anyone, means...... our friends, relations like parents, brothers, sisters and even the spouse is also already decided in the heaven.|`|uWgjWbyIaa	I agree marriages are made by people.  Unfortunately it is easier to point a finger at someone else, say it is their fault and run away.|`|nrvNx69jaa	No.  Marriage is made by choice. Divorce rates are high because some people who gets married don't know what marriage means, how it works, etc etc and only a few knows that its overrated.  Because reality is, there is more hardship than good times, but those hardships, if tackled maturely and wisely will lead to a lasting relationship.  Most people give up after they find out how their partners are at home, or how their partners are to their family, etc etc..  Bottom line is, if you are not ready for the ultimate sacrifice, don't get married.  Chances are, you'll screw it up.  And if you are ready, be ready for a roller coaster ride.  It's fun and very disappointing!!|`|t2W9RE9faa	Because those marriages were made in hell.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I agree. While God looks highly and "recommends" or calls us to marry, marriages are made by people. I think more times than not, people marry for the wrong reasons. Or they marry thinking the other will change upon marriage, leaving the relationship doomed from the start.  The reason for the high divorce rates is because of the above, and because no fault divorces are relatively easy to obtain.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	who gives chance to heavens will.people most of the times get married without thinking and actually loving each other    so hence the divorce rate is soring high|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Yes marriages are made in heaven... but divorces are made here on earth... so that's why the divorce rates are so high..

xkgcYeXPaa	well getting junior high aged guys can be hard. They don't fall for the tricks like free candy like the elementary aged kids. My suggestion tell them your working for MTV and ask them if they want to go back to the van for an interview.|`|U9EwARTKaa	just talk to him a lot and maybe ask him to hang out side of school. the truth hurts but to be honest guys like it when girls are slutty, anyone who says differently are *******|`|kNTkfMaWaa	Find out where guys are coming from in general. You've probably heard that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, so don't assume that guys think the way you do, nor that they interpret situations the way you do. Learn what to expect from them.   Get to know him. Sometimes we become enamored with a fantasy that the guy can fit into, more than the real person himself. Make sure your intentions are genuine and show him how you feel.   Understand that appearance is most certainly not everything. There are, of course, some guys who feel that appearance outweighs personality in a relationship, but that is not true for all guys. (See the Tips below.) Keep your appearance the way it normally is unless you are already dating and dressing up for an occasion, because if you are not desired for who you truly are, then why be involved in a relationship in which you portray yourself as something you are not?   Make conversation. Take an interest in who he is--what he likes, where he's coming from, where he wants to go--and show him who you are, too. Look for common ground but also use this as an opportunity to open your mind and respect his individuality. Whether he's into death metal or Nascar, take an interest in his interests.   Learn to read him. Every guy has his own way of showing that he likes someone, and you can find out what his is by being observant and patient.   Find out what he's looking for in a girlfriend (or what he's bent on avoiding) and see if that matches up with who you are and who you're striving to be. But, don't bend your personality to fit his ideals--remember to be yourself.         [edit] TipsClothing is a very controversial issue to guys, because they're divided. There seems to be one group of guys who feel that the girl should wear whatever she feels comfortable in, because that confidence (in herself) alone is sexy. However, there exists another group of guys who feel that the girl should wear clothing that shows off her body. Whichever way you go, don't go overboard--don't get so comfortable that you're in rags, and don't get to dressed up that you look like a cheap thrill.   Be nice to his friends. If the two of you end up dating, you don't want there to be a persistent conflict between you and his friends. Think about it from your own perspective: Your friends not liking someone for you might not necessarily stop you from dating him, but it'll sure put a strain on both relationships. It's much nicer if your romantic interest makes a sincere effort to befriend your friends.   All guys are different, as are all girls. If something doesn't work with one guy, just remember that there are millions of them out there that you could speak to, and that they are not all the same, so generalizations about how to get a guy cannot be slapped on any of them.   But be yourself and be true to your heart!   When he talks to you, ever so oftenly compliment him on his shoes, clothes, hair..etc..(but DO NOT come on too strong and keep complimenting him he'll think you're clingy)   If done correctly, fluttering your eyes subtly is very seductive, so practise in the mirror   Eye contact is a must, so whenever you're sharing a moment, try and hold his eye contact for just a little longer, with a nice soft smile, this is very alluring and he might even lean in for a kiss :)   Do NOT Stare! this is very unappealing.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Give him a BJ. That'll seal the deal.

If you really want to find a good guy, dress modest, you want a guy who likes you for you not your bod.|`|WNskx1JGaa	I agree with what everyone has said. But although you may dress modest it doesn't mean that you are modest.    Try to attract little to no attention from guys. Be yourself and give them a challenge, make them work for it.    Smile and be friendly always. But don't give every single guy the time of day. Just be confident in your clothes and in the skin you're in and the guys will pile up regardless.    Back to clothes...I have one suggestion. Like if you're going out one night, instead of putting on a short and skimpy dress, still wear the dress but wear some tights to cover your legs and just wear some nice boots with a medium heel.    Your accessories will tell it all as well, they help to make your outfit fancier. Bangles, earrings, necklaces, belts etc.   Just match it up and make it look cute!!!    Keep a smile and a nice personality as well. You want to be known for your personality rather than the clothes you wear.    Just wear the clothes that are cute but more eloquent and reserved. Not too tight but an outfit that fits on your body to show that you do have curves.    Lastly, wear perfume. Make sure it is just right and mellow, not too|`|QCL7WIEtaa	the "black dress"

08y217Rdaa	If you tell a guy about other guys, calling or not, you will definitely get some rough notes. Hanging out at his place could mean that you are blacklisted, considered entertainment, or he wants to think things over.  Asking what's the point in hanging out there would not hurt.

Tread carefully|`|9WHtStZNaa	Returning the favor-    Seriously, she knew she had you, and she may be trying to keep you in her little net.

I need heaps of help!http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|XTDeAfTqaa	My ex fiancee used to do the same thing to me. I guess she didn't realize how painful it was for her to be around me. Even after we moved far away from each other she would always send me birthday cards and Christmas cards even though I didn't return the favor.  In hindsight I believe she really wanted to stay friends (we had grown up next door to one another) but she just didn't get how badly she hurt me.  I wish I had stayed friends with her because I ended up marrying the greatest woman on earth and my ex doesn't hold a candle to her. I'm glad I didn't marry her but it has been 16 years since I've even spoken to her so I don't see the point in trying to rekindle the friendship.|`|rqNb6FIraa	It's a girl thing. We like to temp guys that are vulnerable and having problems by helping them and giving them advice.

1R1tYAbPaa	If he didn't like you he wouldn't be around you. Now does he like you in a romantic way? Thats hard to say. He may just be nice, he could also be into you. Only he would know. If I were to guess, I would say he is interested on some level based on his actions.  You have two options as I see it. You can go for it and tell him how you feel, or you can wait see if he makes a move. You may pass up a relationship by waiting or you may find something better. Thats the beauty about life, choices and the different paths they take us.|`|of1dkoFtaa	HAHAHH i got lost after the first paragraph particularly with the part about how he was positioned on the couch, between you, and the other guy and also under the table? (is that humanly possible haha)   hmm maybe u should just ask him, ask a friend to ask him or maybe flirt a little and gauge his response....and the calling thing maybe u were gonna be late idk ...i hope i helped a little at least|`|Nqns4I0laa	I would say yes, but the best way to know is to just ask him.|`|ChMTXl3saa	Comfortable...
BGkSeq2Saa	I think this may be a sign that your boyfriend is too old for you. you'd probably be better off with someone who is your own age or at least still an undergrad. Seven or so sexual partners in a 23-yr-old's past is not terribly uncommon -- he's no nun by any means, but he hasn't been particularly promiscuous either (if you factor in the time period we live in and that he most likely started having sex in high school.) In both experience and chronological age, you and this guy are in very different places in your lives.    Losing your virginity is a big deal. You're not overreacting.     A separate but related issue: try to avoid at all costs the "how many people have you slept with" conversation in future relationships. It never leads anywhere good.|`|KjaKZYGfaa	If I were in your position I would slap him and walk away. From a christian girl's perspective, I say that having sex before marriage is wrong and seven times is absolutely disgusting.

Might look like you're trying too hard. As cynical as this sounds, I would probably just buy one at the store.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	She may take it the wrong way, but just make sure you tell her you just thought the design was cool and she would like it, make sure you tell her its not a VAlentine necessarily.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Aww, that sounds beautiful & unique! I bet she would love it. I bet any girl reading this right now wishes she would get one of those! lol    She would like it either way & you could play it off. See how she responds ~ if she starts acting more flirty around you, take another chance & start being more flirty too. If not, just kinda smile it off & say, hey gfriends can give sweet things to friends too, can't they? And keep being her friend. :)     Good luck, hope she returns the sentiments to you.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Well I would think it's really sweet... I appreciate such things.. :) but other girls might find it freaky... but I would think it's sweet..|`|GFSxvJRjaa	you should just give it to her. i wouldn't be freaked out if someone made me a cool card.|`|cUwbfosuaa	She'll find it nice, she'll probably think you're doing it  just because you guys are good friends.|`|oc0pCUhyaa	personally i wouldn't freak out.... its just a nice gesture|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	Your question is so specific to the relationship that your gonna have to answer this yourself.

(put a lot of hearts on it and put and nicely written message in it and a nicely written To:________ on the cover  if she doesnt seem awkward after seeing her lovey card cover then ask her to be ur valentine|`|vsX1SpyXaa	I think it would be so sweet to give her the card.

Cpp1LddVaa	If you can answer "yes" to any of these questions, you're off to a good start.    (1)  During the fall, particularly on Sunday afternoons in September and October, is he willing to admit it when this afternoon's football game is totally boring, turn the TV off and take you shopping or to the park?    (2)  When you really want to try something a certain way and he really wants to try another way, will he ever say  "what the heck" and do it your way because it's important to make certain that both partners get opportunities to follow through on their ideas?    (3)  When all of his buddies want to have a night or a weekend "on the  town," does he say "no" and spend that time with you instead without acting like he's doing you a big favor?|`|oEUjPGsUaa	you could feel it by looking at him|`|aEonduUUaa	Well im the guy but she really would be interested in me and then like not tell me to leave her alone =)
ZjqdLSv2aa	Good on you for dumping the people pretending to be your friends. Most people unfortunately take the abuse for the sake of not being lonely.    You shouldn't break up with a girl because you think you're holding her back. If a girl feels that way then they will either talk to you about it, or dump you. If you ever feel concerned that you're holding a girl back then simply ask them that and let them know that you care about them so you don't want to be the reason they lose track of their plans.    As for getting new friends - well - you can be friends with somebody you have nothing in common with. No, really. I have two friends (a husband and his wife) who I've been friends with since we three were 14 years old. I have nothing in common with them, but I learn about what they like and research it so I can understand why they like it and that way I can ask them questions about it. That creates such a great bond when you ask someone about their passions and they know you personally don't enjoy the same things.    We three now consider each other as siblings and you can easily do this too. Just go up to anyone who might seem like a good person. If they are then start a friendship with them and then learn about what they like.    I also strongly suggest reading the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. Great book. Short and entertaining read.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	No, it's not a phase - you just need to meet someone who can connect to you because obviously you aren't connecting with anyone you're meeting.    Having certain hobbies and such is a great way to meet girls who have things in common with you.  Browsing on MySpace and Facebook won't hurt either.    Oh and learn to type and spell.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	Try to reach out a little more,be your self with more confidence.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	It'll probably go away...    As will the fact that you don't know how to spell or type.|`|AA11108018	Yes this happens in life.  The other thing is your spelling|`|5OORL0IWaa	I am 18 I have been with the same guy for 4 years I lost all my friends about 3 years ago because I couldn't go out and be single and mingle you know they wanted to party and sleep with hella guys I am dedicated You have you're whole life ahead of you I suggest trying to make new friends and being more social you will click with some one don't worry but please find better friends you will regret it if you don't.
QSodlfMraa	be carefull guys are nut jobs,|`|wE2etBzbaa	tell them they can love each other and they can go to Massachusetts|`|oPJYs4cQaa	well who do you like?  follow your heart girl!  don't just go with one because you feel bad for him because your just going to end up hurting yourself!|`|LojhyKJhaa	well i'm a guy and ive been there before. u absolutely fall for a girl and unfortunately so does somebody else. if they both say they love you, then obviously they like you a lot(doubt its real love though). all you really need to do is spend time with both of them and talk to each of them and see which guy is honestly the best for you and which one makes you happier to be with. that's all u really need to do, and you'll get it all figured out soon.    Good Luck!,     Ian B.
VSVQHKwKaa	Look,    Your friendship with these people was based upon the interaction you made with them in person.    Now that you are far removed, there is no interaction, hence there is no friendship.    Rather than getting all hung up on it, why not go out and find new friends?    Let this couple slide into the acquaintance category. Perhaps one day, they move closer to you and you can enjoy your face to face relationship again.    Good Luck!
4v8kXmmcaa	shouldnt matter, if you have the feelings, and want to be together, then be together, Or tell him you want to go out, and maybe he'll formally ask you. It shouldn't matter though. Hope this helps|`|xzX3NSUjaa	You should ask him out. If you wait for him to ask you, it might never happen because guys get scared & nervous just like we do. It shouldn't have to be up to the man to do everything. Women should make the move sometimes too.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	ask him they like it when u make a move|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	this is the 20th century.  just ask him out if you like him.. jeez.|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	sure if u want but dont do anything u dont want to do
D8OzQwXKaa	maybe he being an azz|`|5haXKcIuaa	you can tell if he has a girlfriend by the way he acts around u.. pay close attention does he act single?|`|EeQ6qL52aa	either that or he's gay. He's def. interested in you tho.|`|NBsULHytaa	He was just giving you a high five!  A lot of guys do that and it doesnt necessaily mean they are flirting.  If that is true, then guys flirt A LOT!|`|DTN6Vg8caa	ok this question is abt the instructor rite but it features ur partner at class r u interested in him or the instructor    common it was jus a handshake kinda thing and hes older|`|6Bd7w6RJaa	no. you wont know if you would not ask him or his friends.|`|hn3qLpXJaa	ahhhh cool:D  i have no idea haha!    that's fun to think about...|`|zRyGcN6yaa	I'm so sorry Im a girl, But yeah It was flirting. U On a roll girl! :D|`|Ddb5821Jaa	feels good to do well and have someone recognize it.  I think everyone has a favorite teacher. maybe this guy you learn well from? Maybe he ENJOYS you in his class. If it gets creepy, id tell someone, anything more then a high five is BAD.|`|AA10179574	it's called a hi five. what are you like 12? don't be so overly sentimental.|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Simple. Talk to him.  If you talk to him long enough about what his interests are then eventually he'll mention that he has a girlfriend (something along the lines of "yeah me and my girl friend..." or "my girlfriend did..."  etc.    As far as if hes interested well just keep talking to him and if he flirts (trust me most of us or pretty obvious) then you'll know.|`|2eCmyfH2aa	seriously,  just ask him if he has a gf.  Guys are simple,  he is not going to be 'scared off' if you ask him if he has a gf,  be upfront guys (like me) really like it and it might save you a psycotic breakdown down the track|`|TNKFfxsqaa	Well, it can be if he didnt remove his hand from yours with the quickness. If you wanna ask about his love life, ask him if he wants to hang out with you and your friends... if he says he has plans, then yes he has a gf, but if he says sure and ask what the plans are then the possibility of him having a gf is slim.|`|1HkTZy9paa	Well It depends who it is if its like a more laid back cool type then yes but if geeky or nerdy no but just try to make plans with him and see if he says I'm sorry i cant go because i already have someone but if not try to look into it more like i wouldn't think its an awkward moment to ask even if he is single or taken..|`|arVdbgBlaa	He is definetly flirting because most guys would say good job and that's that and to your other question ok so I read one of the answer left on here and it said notice if he acts single...... well that is  not always the case trust me just try to make converision on random stuff that would kinda lead into seeing if he has a gf pay vary close attention to the lil detail he says other than that good luck :)
NUWdgQuraa	I would say she's stalking you.  She sounds psycho enough.  A restraining order might be needed.    (I am being serious.)
dxlNwGuWaa	She likes the fact that you fancy her and is trying to keep you interested, probably for self esteem issues.  Be careful with this one.  If the flirty messages continue (she didnt have to tell you about the dress, did she?) tell her you like her again.  If she responds with the 'just stay friends' thing, i'd make a point of saying friends dont flirt like that, and that you feel like she is leading you on.  Unless of course you are enjoying it, then by all means dont say anything at all.  This girl likes being chased, so its up to you if you want to carry on chasing.|`|Wk7086lEaa	"I need you to tell me I'm pretty because I have low self-esteem"|`|1poSSvTdaa	She's warming up, but don't scare her off by being too bold now. Play a waiting game, and she will come round. Good luck.|`|CqJnT2Oqaa	Say "well, you'll have to wear it for me again then".  About whether she wants a relationship or not... it really depends on the girl.  You'll just have to trust your gut and ask her out when you think it's right... or move on.|`|MGixzYVHaa	LOL i think she wanted your opinion on her dress.|`|rd5468H1aa	She values your opinion. You probably have a chance to date her, but she's just not ready to date at the moment.|`|hRV18njLaa	I think maybe she likes you ;)     theres this boy i like and when hes not at school it makes me annoyed because i try to look my best for him ;)    Saying i wore a lovely dress today makes me think that she likes you and she was sad because t=you didnt get to see it.    I hope im right for you! =)    Have a lovely Day! xxxx
CaKu7gbAaa	HI, I understand your feelings. but please don't be upset, you said tat you are confident and would be intelligent too..I guess so. Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder, beauty should be judged  by good heart and not by looks. You please don't depress yourself, show this world and your all classmates that you are the greatest of all. Study hard and make some goal, become something in you by forgetting about your beauty. I know its hard, but once you ll become something, you will gain fame, wealth  and then you can get plastic surgery and off course you will get work too with your intelligence and confidence. every company requires dedicating and intelligent people and you will be that one day. Don't let anyone to laugh at you, prove them that God has created you and you are the best than those beautiful people.    Study hard, achieve your goal and then you can fulfill your all dreams. If you say, you don't have any friend, then I can be your friend, you can email me and share your feeling with me.    If you don't want to go to school , don't go but study hard and achieve the best marks, show your classmates your strength. And you yourself will start feeling to go to school and always think you are the best and don' cry at all. just request God to give you power to face everything for what he has created. because he is the greatest and most powerful of all.    take care my loving friend|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	you will find that in this world school is and has been about the worse time in the lifes of many or most people, as other kids can be very cruel. many of them get clickish and think their cool if they hang with the more popular kids, i was one of those as a example i would be embarressed eating lunch alone or if i sat with others felt maybe i was'nt really wanted. in any case do not think yet about plastic surgery,or being a actress yet, but concentrate on being yourself, dressing the best you can, always be pleasant and nice but don't fake the personality thing, be your self and concentrate on studys and doing the best you can with what you have for now.when out of school things will get better in all ways and most superficial friends will have miserible lifes and they think now they are soooo great, well they will find out later with their attitudes once out of school life will change. let it change for you for the better, your the one and your parents that will be in control not school friends.|`|1zwxspIAaa	Join the army.|`|cCdkSsTzaa	Listen: we all are ugly, but we all have to go to school, to go to work, to live. Are you sure you are not too hard on you? at times teens see themselves uglier than they are.|`|w4ZPcamlaa	I feel so sorry 4 u so sorry. People these days can be so mean they should like u 4 who u are not how u look. You sound like a nice person u shouldn't be treated like this. U might be ugly on the outside but u are Pretty on the inside. Pay no attention to the people who treat u like crap because of the way u look, there not worth the fuss.Hopefully u will find better people who like u 4 who u are. I hope ur life at school gets better and i hope helped. Good luck|`|R8VBZxD4aa	Emotionally challenged? I tried to express myself, at a similar point in my youthful days, by using meditation.|`|HxKCvUb9aa	Actually the army isnt a bad idea|`|c7yAbvycaa	if you think that you really can't go to hs anymore then why not consider home school?  beauty is not considered by what the eyes can see, its more deeper than that. if you don't appreciate yourself,then no one would.  finish your studies then if you still want plastic surgery later on,then you will have the money to spend.
b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	I don't care if those fat White dudes are dating Asian babes. They better keep their hands off Latina babes and White babes. Latina babes and White babes are strictly for Asian men.|`|NBXY35zPaa	Ryota's right, my cousins who are white guys LOVE Asian chicks and they're always pointing them out randomly in the street and I'm just thinking "ugh, she's not all that man..."

WNskx1JGaa	We usually go for black guys because hypothetically we are able to connect with them better.    But currently right now I am talking to a white guy and he is great!!! We are only friends though. I have never anticipated a relationship with a white guy but I never doubted one either.    The truth is that you are people just like we are. Just because hes white it doesnt mean he isnt right. I am attracted to people all colors and sizes, not just black. I do have my favorite preference though in black guys but at the same time I think I might be brainwashing myself, because all men are equally attractive no matter their race ;-).     Just as long as theres a special bond and attraction between the two, us black women are attracted to any guy. It just takes some getting use to thats all.  Because different cultures are different but the love will balance everything out.|`|Q6xDAc4taa	it doesnt matter.. as long as you have a connection color doesnt matter at all.. peace(nd ah know im beautiful..lol)
gKa5rdNYaa	Seems to me you really like him, so go for it. But dont jump into it! Tell him you want to hang out for a couple of weeks and then see how you feel! You may realize then that he's not the one for you, that it may have just been missing the old times you 2 had together ya know! Hope this helps!|`|yev2iWgWaa	quick child. nowadays it is so difficult to get such gem of friend you described  go even beg him you will always be honest loving to full might  please go to him and make up for all follies that made you separate. never let go a good honest friend you may not get again|`|LnUTR1Z4aa	are their still butterflies. or do you think you too grew apart.   maybe you could give it a trial run and see if their are still sparks, if it does not work then maybe you shold just be friends|`|q2mSoCZTaa	well all you can do is lead with your heart not your mind. if you really care about him then take him back. hope i helped|`|YfoYgjB0aa	Omg if treated u the way u deserved and never cheated on u, then he's probably better than 80% of other men in the world haha (jp) but seriously tho, i think u should go for it....give him another chance    BUT    if he decides to break up wit u again or treat u without respect then don't even bother with him anymore. A second chance is all he deserves, but not any more than that!|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	dont take him back, i know theres feelings between you two but you are apart for a reason. take that as a sign and move on with your life|`|f3SyOyMEaa	If you're having doubts and you feel that you are growing and changing without him, I wouldn't go back at least yet. Give yourself time to see what your feelings are and if you want to go back to where you were with him. Sometimes you have to leave before you realize what you left behind, but why did he leave you? Who is to say that he won't do it again? I don't know the whole situation, but if he really loves you, he'll wait and find out what your decision is. He's the one that caused all of this. Find out who you are and what you want and if he's still there and you want him...great. If not, you're both better off.    Best Wishes|`|LsDdJlDgaa	huh.dont do that,|`|COJq7M4Eaa	if you still love each other then get back right..|`|S4gKPOBOaa	why hes your x.|`|hUsW2Iymaa	Doesnt hurt to give it another chance you can always back out again.

You both want it.|`|xi1f5EAeaa	sounds like you want him back just let him beg a little more but take him back. make him regret making that stupid decision, he figures that he can dump you but if he cant find no one else the he can just creep on back|`|e7qTRzfkaa	dont do it. one of my ex's ask for me back and it was fatal attraction still till today now shell think ill take her back if she just ask... It would be the biggest mistake of your dating life!!!|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	If you really feel that it is right, then yes. By all means. Keep your guard up for a little bit. But if you two really love each other, there's no need to stay apart. I do suggest you two sit down and have a long talk about what guided his decision to end things in the first place and see where there could be room for improvement on both ends. Keep open with each other to make it work.|`|lU8ucOpjaa	How old are you?    I'm going to assume *no offense* that if your posting that kind of question on here then there is some growing up that needs to happen.  Maybe you guys should get back together- just take a break for now.  Give it a few months and see how you feel.  Sometimes it may be difficult but maybe you guys just need to do some growing up and discover who you really are?|`|wXp06yBEaa	If you like him, then yes you should take him back and mend the relationship but make sure he knows what he did wrong and maybe take you out to a nice dinner. Milk it for all it's worth. We all like flowers and chocolate, don't we?|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	I love your way of thinking. Nadia, you're not the same person he went out with and broke up with and you realize that. Does your new-found self feel like you can work with that guy again?    My ex broke up with me and although she seems she wants to get back together....I feel I've changed and grown more independent. I recognize that i deserve better, someone who will not do what she did to me. I wasn't hurt...but surprised of how quickly she ended it after telling me that she loved me for a long time. I am skeptical of a relationship after a breakup because they broke your heart and even though you mended it back...it's never the same again.    Again, if you trust that he won't break it again and you love him...go for it!|`|lrqjTm7naa	If you've already begun to "grow and change," I'd keep going forward with your life, not backward.  Good luck.|`|1HkTZy9paa	Well if you wanna take him back show him that you have changed but not verbally but mentally but i say move on i mean if you really love him do it but if you can't deal with those problems in your life do yourself a favor and move on|`|oxkxo3L5aa	na **** that foo bicth if u where smart u will start hoeing ur self out for 50 dollars on fridays aight hope this helps lates|`|AABCy5mQaa	You obviously said that you have grown and changed since you guys have broken up. You are on a new path moving forward. Make sure if you take him back, you both move forward together, and not backwards. If you get back together,and are going through the same ole stuff again, I'd question the relationship. But why not give it the benefit of the doubt. You guys still have love.. and a good guy is hard to find. Give it another chance and see where the wind takes you. Its better than 20 years from now you regretting not making the attempt.|`|4glrvKh9aa	This happened to me as well. I dated my boyfriend for 2 years and he broke up with me over something stupid. It's hard to get over a relationship that was good, jerks are so much easier to get over. I took my boyfriend back because it felt right, but I still don't know if I made the right choice. I couldn't see myself living without him before, but now I remember the more negative aspects of the relationship and am somewhat second guessing it.    Do what YOU feel is right! If you think that he is the ONE for you, and proves that he is truly sorry, then take him back. I'm not a believer in "they're your ex for a reason"... sometimes you need time apart to realize you can't live without each other. Do what you think is best for you, would it make you happier? Would you have trust issues after this? It depends!
2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I agree with you about it being outdated.  I'm really happy my fiance didn't do that, because I'm 29 years old and don't feel like I need anyone's permission to get married.  Also, I don't like the concept of being "given away."  It's a wedding, not a slave auction.      The tradition originally started back in the day when young women really sort of were their fathers' property.  Since women didn't used to work or support themselves, they were kind of a financial burden on their dads until they were able to get married off to some guy who would support them.  You've probably heard of a dowry, where a girl's dad would actually have to give the prospective groom all kinds of money, livestock, household goods, and even land in order to get him to marry her.  Marriage was all business for a very long time- the notion of marrying for love didn't really happen much until the 19th century or so.  Up till then, most marriages were arranged by the parents of the bride and groom for reasons having to do with social status and money.|`|VygBNA0Waa	i disagree with  you its respect and doing the right thing it makes your dad feel respected he did it because he loves you and now your being a bitc$ and mean so stop sooking and be happy a lot of women would love there man to do that your so slack i hope you did tell him that or your dad be nice to people don't be nasty all the time life is to short|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Very good question.  And too many to count.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	It is an old tradition; and one based mainly on respect.  Even though it is an old tradition that is slowly dying; it really isn't a sin to ask for a woman's hand in marriage.    Sounds like you have a gentlemen in your life, why would that upset you so much?  Would you rather he be a rude jerk?    It is confusing why you are making such a big deal out of this....unless you father has made it clear he does not like your boyfriend and you are worried about what his answer would be.    Sexist tradition?  Oh puhleeesseee.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I think that your fiance is very sweet and romantic for doing that. Guys do this not to be sexist or passing you around, they do it because they want the father of the bride to feel respected and acknowledge.    Having your child be married is tough on both parents because it's a reality check that their little baby is growing up. It is especially hard on the father of the bride because it's his little girl, now a woman and being taken away from him.     By your fiance asking your father for your hand in marriage only makes your father feel great and that makes them both look at each other differently and have a bit little more respect towards eachother.    Don't feel disapointed! This is a good thing, even though you think it's outdated.    Congrats on your engagement and I hope the best for you and your fiance! Good luck with everything!|`|MkErhX7Haa	I'm old fashioned and I kind of think it's a sweet tradition.  It's a sign of respect to get the parents' blessing before proposing.  It's not necessarily "your daughter is property, can I have her?"  it's more like, "I want to marry your daughter and I want to know that you, as her parents, support our decision."      I can see how you or anyone else would think it's outdated or sexist though.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you're right, it's antiquated and sexist.  as if your father needs to approve the family your fiance is from in order to pass some dowry on to him.  welcome to the 21st century people!  women don't even need to marry men if they don't want!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it IS outdated, and he doesn't HAVE to do that.  some guys might still out of respect,and depending how close the family is or how traditional or old-fashioned.|`|a984cQjKaa	i agree with you; i'm of age and i'm not my father's property so i would be angry if my boyfriend asked him for permission to marry me.  it might be "respectful" to my father, but it's disrespectful to me.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	actually, i think you should be kinda proud of him, he probably did it for you maybe possibly thinking it was romantic. it is a tradition and may be outdated but there still is nothing wrong w/it. as far as wondering where it came from and what other "sexist" traditions there are it i gather it would be a waste of time for this post. may your marriage be long and happy!!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Unless you are still living in the dark ages, there is no requirement to do so. It wasn't until fairly recently in history (the 1960s actually) that women were considered to be their own person, rather than the property of their husband or father. Prior to that, women didn't work and they didn't have any say in anything. Marriages were treated as business contracts between the potential husband and her father, which is why the boy asked permission. Obviously in this day and age, since folks have evolved for the most part, that isn't necessary and most people don't do it anymore. If you are of legal age (18), then your parents have no legal authority over you anymore and they can't dictate whether you can marry your boyfriend or not.    Most if not all wedding traditions and superstitions are sexist.
i6WVPncnaa	I will put everything aside to get to know the other person.  At first I look at appearance and then personality.  If he is not that attractive and I love their personality then I give them a chance.  You should stop judging people on just the first impression, because you will be alone for a long time.
np5R16RSaa	PICK something u really like doing. could be silly stuff too and when u open ur eyes ur a lITTLE anxies to get up.  for instance, u like donuts? coffee?  for me, its the coffee and cigerratte ;)|`|fQgbBx7caa	I guess not if I was your boss and hired you because I needed you, you came to me for a job and I believed it and counted on you, I would fire you....Don't you hate it when you count on someone for something and they don't come through, think of your boss when you pull this on him or her.

AA10682405	If you have to question whether or not he means it, he doesn't mean it. If he meant it, you would know, because he would prove it to you. If you're not sure if he's being sincere, he's not. Because if he was being sincere his actions would show it, and his stories wouldn't change... and you wouldn't catch him flirting with other girls. Getting you is a challenge for him, because he's been trying and hasn't succeeded yet, so he's going to say whatever he has to say to get what he wants. If you catch him doing something that completely contradicts what he says, well let's just say "actions speak louder than words".|`|DytfqrkSaa	Oh please...DO NOT believe him. This is why he is known as a "Playa" this is what they do, they sweet talk you and make you think that everything is okay, and that they are only interested in one woman. Please do not get swept up in his pety attempts to keep you. Those moves can work on little high school girls who only really need a few sweet words. Ask yourself, do you want to be a high school girl? Or do you want to be a strong woman? The choice is yours, but please take what people say into consideration.    P.S. Hai Michelle!     P.P.S. Good luck though...you're going to need it, drop him and move on. He's a little boy using little boy moves on you.    Ryan|`|oKqWOeOiaa	i think it could be sweet talk, most guys play the same game. especially during "the dating phase". you might have to step up into the game & make it look as if you're talking to other guys [even if they're jus friends, & you're not flirting],  trust me, guys are very territorial. He'll spark up a lil jealousy & become more interested in you if he sees there may be competition. but anyway keep an eye on him gurl! & keep a few backups just in case ;]|`|nA97uWdyaa	If you're not giving him what he wants then he's eventually going to look somewhere else. It sounds like you are wasting his time.|`|EHCM324Faa	He just basically lying to you. He just saying what all women want to hear. You can't trust a guy who say he "use to be" a player|`|fMbTvp4laa	yeah not to be against him but hes lying. i know my lies and ive heard all of them. to me if you want to be with him be skeptical bout what he does wen you are not with him but hes lying bout being a player or if he is one hes lying bout you being his only woman|`|UhK363oJaa	i dont think he means it|`|gKa5rdNYaa	Well your question pretty much answered that! When a PLAYER....... enough said!|`|nnj6A8luaa	I'm gonna agree with j0wner.    People you have to realize if you wanna act hard to get, don't expect other people to keep pursuing you because for them, it's a lost cause. They think you're not interested in them and they're moving on.    So basically what I'm trying to say is stop being an idiot and treat him better.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	of course not|`|uRQEubkPaa	No , you shouldn't believe him...  Specially because his still playing..... the proof is that he has been texting other girls.|`|wE2etBzbaa	really, he meant it? I think it is obvious.  he is one woman guy, means he is a woman and guy in same person, and stuck it often in his butt
wE2etBzbaa	Me. I went once with myself on a date, it was scary and creepy, as I was very quiet with myself and I only ordered one coffee for both of us, then went back home, and myself followed me everywhere i went. so creepy on a first date.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	LOL, oh my.    The creepiest was this guy who I "met" from the internet.  He claimed he lived around the area and knew of all the places I asked him about.  We agreed to hang out (so it was more casual than a date), but he told me to not tell anyone that I was going to hang out with him because he didn't want his friends to know he was meeting people online.  However, he was a couple years old than I, so I thought this was really weird.    We agreed to get a drink after work and school, and met up at a local tea station (I told all my friends and family where I was, in case he kidnapped me).  He took me to a coffee shop he thought was supposedly open but was closed.  It's sort of located on a street with a cinema, and a bunch of restaurants and shops, so we walked around for a little bit.  He offered to massage my shoulders which was really uncomfortable because he did it too hard; afterward he held my hand - which again felt uncomfortable 'cause they were really bony and cold.    Did I also mention he looked nothing like his picture???  Not that he was much older or younger from his photos, but he was much fatter - well, at least his face was, not his body.  He was sort of recognizable, but his face was covered in acne and seemed to look swollen, omg.    Anyways, after that he said he had to go and meet up with his friends (how rude), so he would take me back to my car.  Before I got out, he stopped me, asked for a kiss, closed his eyes, and puckered his lips.  What the f, right?  Who straight out asks for a kiss like that, after hanging out for not more than an hour and then leaving to hang out with his friends???  I actually got kind of scared, so not to aggravate him and possibly kidnap/rape me, I closed my eyes and gave him a simple peck on the lips, and got out of the car as fast as possible.    Safe to say, there was no second "date".    Wait, I've had other really awful ones too (I know, hard to believe), but I don't really remember them.  I guess they were so bad, I just blocked them out of my memory hahah|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I went out with a guy a few times. He seemed very charming, we had similar interests, he was good looking, seemed to be quite a catch.  He did have a couple ex wives though, and one had a restraining order against him.  That was a warning sign of course, but I couldn't see anything bad about him. When he told me about it, I asked why, and he said "I'm not really sure why, but she's afraid of me. She has some issues".      Now, I DO know of women who have taken out restraining orders against men who have never hurt them or done anything to them, just to get back at them.  So, I thought it was possible.    One day, we got in an arguement over something fairly inconsequencial.  He got REALLY upset, and told me to shut up. I don't take being told to shut up well, I'm more into communication and talking out problems. So, of course, I didn't.    He went totally mental, started screaming at me and went nuts. We were driving, and I was doing the driving, and I was 99% sure had I not been driving he would have hit me.  It really scared me.      I dropped him off, and drove away from there fast.  He called a couple times after, saying he was sorry.  He left the messages on my phone, I never actually spoke to him again.|`|dzbblpjgaa	Some one who tries so hard they mirror every move you make and stares at you constantly. Ughh get me out of here!|`|biF7sad1aa	My sister went out on a date with this guy called Fuzzy, or Fozzy, or something, and she said it was the weirdest experience she'd ever had.|`|uoMnK389aa	I met a guy through friends and we went for coffee later on on our own.

mP6naFLDaa	sometimes guys are just sleeping and the phone rings and they dont answer. I did that before and my friend called whom I havent talked to in over a year and I answerd and my GF at the time got pissed at me and assumed the worse,I'm not telling you what to do but if you really trust him then believe him|`|3TdT5mG2aa	This is something immature. Perhaps you are really angry about something else but it is coming out now? Give him S-P-A-C-E. If he says he was laying down, believe him. Don't call his phone a hundred times.

6GUpUXoXaa	I would just talk to him let him know how you feel .  tell him that you don't want to ruin anything between him and his girlfriend but you just need to get it off your chest... after that hes the one that is going to make the final decision.  you can't make him feel some way hes not and you can't let your feelings be left unsaid|`|wFzW3Aqvaa	well there are 2 options    1.) let it go he was never yours and you should be glad he is yours    2.) show him a side of his gf he hasn't seen and wont like|`|iTKhQKdBaa	okay dude suck it up that's life. you're not gunna get what you want just because you're good. life isn't fair and there's nothing you can do about the guy liking another girl.  every girl deals with it and i know people who have liked 1 or 2 guys since kindergarten and they still do. some have even liked me and they're my best friends but still its not my fault they liked me and its not my fault that some of the guys i like don't like me back.  you can flirt and try to get him to fall for you if you want.|`|p8fD4thJaa	Don't give up on him!

cVDZIuaOaa	Yeah, ha it's pretty obvious he likes you.       If you don't want him around you anymore, because you feel he hinders your relationships with your friends, then keep staying a little distant from him.  Don't initiate conversations with him, but don't be mean and ignore him or show him attitude or any of that.      By ignoring him, you are not being mean by any means, so don't feel guilty about it.    The less you talk to him, the less interested he will become of you, and he'll back off himself.|`|LjNx9Uanaa	LOL... i had experienced that too, but what i did was i talk to him and ask him what is that he really wanted in me.He told me he liked me.so i told him what i felt too, that i dont like him.The reason why he stop bothering me now.So maybe it will help you.. try to be frank doesnt mean your mean.

Please talk to him about it. As a guy if I couldn't tell whether I was being clingy or not, then I would LOVE this information.

The guy always wants a direct answer to a problem...if he's a real man I should say.|`|bd61c4ced48d00aa8ba044c678e51aa9aa	Just be yourself.  I don't think it's mean.  I'm the same way.  People get too clingy and you find yourself trying to avoid them or find ways to let them know that they are clingy.  Try telling him that you are not really a "people person" and see what he says.  He may see you as a social butterfly and not realize that he's bothering you.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	He sounds annoying.  You're not being mean. I think you need to be meaner.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	You're not being mean at all I think you're too nice to him.

That woul give him the hint!    good luck|`|QBGszg3waa	he likes u , duhh|`|6GUpUXoXaa	You're not being too mean but you're not being clear.  Instead of trying to avoid the situation you really have to talk to him and let him know how you feel.  You can't go through college being uncomfortable around him you have to let him know that he is being too clingy and he is interfering with you and your friends.  At the same time you have to be gentle and let him know that it isn't that you don't want to be friends with him but you need your space.|`|174pexgPaa	Don't sit by him on the bus.  But ya you are doing the right thing.  Just don't ask questions and keep your answers short and he will leave you alone|`|KMXQCcRzaa	He sounds super annoying, I would either try being really nice to him and see what else he wants, or be really really mean to him so he will leave you alone. Just don't be too mean to where he would want to retaliate.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	Eeww this guy sounds lame. I can't stand people who can't take the Hint! omg it's not your fault, it's his. It's ok you're not being mean, don't worry because with people like that guy you kinda need to be in order for them to get the message you know. But like someone said b4, you can start talking about a guy you're seeing and do a play by play on a date you went on. Watch his reaction! lol|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Tell him you are the kind of person who needs a bit more space and he has begun to crowd you. Start by telling him the two of you need to talk and and just go into it and say what you said here. Something like. 'My friends are very important to me and since we have become friends I don't get as much time with them.' Or something else that will tactfully convey the problem to him. Apparently, he reads more into the relationship than you want. Whichever way you decide to approach this, when you finish, just be quiet and let him answer or not whichever way he deals with it.    Or you could write it all down. But personally, I'd rather someone talk to me about a problem face to face.
gqD0P4mYaa	Try and get his attention by asking him a question about you know, an assignment you guys are working on. Then maybe you guys could help each other out and then maybe you guys could have a conversation. Be confident, be yourself, and don't try to act like your another person. Good Luck!|`|PO5Q7POuaa	So I had this same problem but the guy I liked was in my English class and I sat behind him not beside =) So I got to stare at the back of his beautiful head for 80 minutes a day haha. Okay lets see what to do about your situation.  If you have his MSN you could always ask him every night what you have for homework, or in class you could ask him for notes because you "lost" yours. Or maybe ask him for paper/pencils/eraser every day =).  Since your in Spanish class, maybe say something in Spanish? And then not only will it help you learn more Spanish but you get to talk to an awosome boy at the same time =D  Whatever you do though, don't be lame like me and not talk to him. I had this boy in my class for 4 months and it took me two and a half months to build up the courage to ask him for a piece of paper... I'm so lame, I know =)  Good luck!|`|JBjR2KDwaa	start by asking what hes doing on the weekend  and then he might say something like playing hockey, so you ask him where he places, what position he plays, does he watch hockey on tv? whoes his favourite team? etc.... thats just an example|`|mSRgkreTaa	Don't be hyper active, that's the most annoying thing ever.  Don't compliment this guy more than two or three times, it starts to look like you're really desperate, and sort of plays into the whole annoyance thing.    Other than that I'd say just sort of observe what he's doing, if he's rubbing his hands together, or wringing his fingers or anything of the sort he's nervous because he probably likes you.

OMn4dxEaaa	she has probably turned lesbian because she feels sad about the boys cheating on her so she puts those feelings away by doing that. if you like her you should wait till this girl is out of the picture then comfort her get closer then once everyhting is going great make the move   hope i helped   lyshi! :)|`|np5R16RSaa	lesbian after two bfs cheating on her! ya u answered your question, i think every girl has considered to be a lesbian after being treated like **** by a man.   as to u liking her that long, man you better move and ask her out before its too late.  i know she is dating a girl right now, but trust me she is in her early stage of being a lesbian and she is CONFUSED AND hurt by men.   gottah prove to her though that you will not end up being like her ex bfs too.  keep that in mind ;) good luck but go get ur girl b4 its too late|`|qJIrH7u2aa	i dont know but lesbians are hott!
bqbIx4Goaa	No, I'd empty him out of my shoe, put my shoe on my foot and then step on him. I don't want him in my shoe but under it is fine.|`|SWrWwNXpaa	I would let her smell my shoe then I'd pound my foot into the ground as I walk and step in dog poop.
QQcAl1eqaa	You have a lot to offer and when it comes to dating that will help you because you have a broad spectrum of interests.  That said, any discussion about YOU as a person and YOUR interests will have to go out the window when you talk to girls.  Your goal, in talking to a girl and getting her to like you is to make her talk about herself.  Everyone loves to talk about things that they're interested in.  Ask her questions about herself -- where are you from, what brought you here, compliment her outfit, nails, hair, where does she go to school, ANYTHING as long as you keep the conversation revolving around her and your flattery sounds sincere.  You are the one talking to her- right?  So you must be interested...  keep the conversation light and pleasant, smile, laugh, tell her what a player she is (even if she's not) and how such a hottie (even if she's not) could be there.  you'll be well on your way to catching a cutie.  Also helps if you dress sharp, have good haircut, breath, etc, work out regularly.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Not trying to sound rude but just blunt ok.Knowledge is awesome and that will make you a rich man someday,But even writing your question that's all you talked about is you and what you want and what you are doing maybe there is your problem.You try to focus so much on that maybe girls can not become interested because that's all you do talk about .How about ok example  say to her there is this awsome movie I really want to go see things like that.Wish yah luck .|`|9RajlJpRaa	smart girls like smart guys and there are smart girls that are pretty! so dont be shy and talk to any girl you want! whats the worst that could happen? if you dont like clubs, just try to meet a girl another spot. you have to be open minded and confident. if you arent confident in yourself, noone will ever think you are worth talking to- even though you have a good head on your shoulders. and make sure you get a makeover if you think you need one- first appearance is a big deal for girls. good luck!|`|Q8etYn60aa	You don't need to improve anything dear (:  I've always been such a sucker for the guy who is 'bad with women', a little bit awkward and not sure what to say.  I think it's adorable.  And I can't be the only girl out there like this (:|`|MGDtjCK1aa	dude clubs are the worst place to find a gf. now for your lil issue. the best thing you can do is practice. try to talk to girls man you got nothing to lose. and you will earn more confidence. 1st start by saying hi then i make a comment about the wheather or something like that, the introduce yourself. say hi my name is so and so and then shake her hand. remember always look them in the eyes. thats a way to disarm them. look at them with a clean look and if you complement them make sure its sincere. for exapled today i said to a girl i met in a class    " you remind me of that girl from that reality show rock of love"  she said  "who"  i said  "brandy c"  she said  "shes realy dumb"  i said  "true but she is beautiful. kinda like you"  but i said it in a clean and sincere way notice i didnt say i dont kno or uh i didnt studder so make sure you are able to work on that 1st. being sure of what you want to express. that shows confidence and girls like that.
jSppTOqaaa	maybe you should state why you dumped him :]   so people dont judge you straight off.        cause none of you people know why she dumped him. so shut your aholey. && maybe ask her why & have a bit of manners?     just tell him you love him. dont make it fun or jumpy it'll sound fake D:|`|0AYPgUQIaa	Over text?  First: grow up.  Second: grow a spine.  Third: Stop listening to TH.  THEN date a guy.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	You don't deserve him back.    I kind of hope you die.|`|nCrbKAuzaa	what's the reason why did you dump him?  well all you have to do is courted him, i mean try to give flowers, send sweet messages and make sure that you mean it. let him feel that you cared a lot and cant afford to lose him. or try this, cook his favorite dish, i'm sure he'll be going to love that.|`|HlzL6sdqaa	ugh..    over-dramatic teenagers..|`|3dc824d455482baacc26222f0a74bfd4aa	you dont deserve to get him back. boys arent yo-yos
E56MF3p6aa	Dont show her what you want directly. Instead try to talk to some other girl in front of her, then wait for her responce and reaction. If she like you then you can see her jelous if she dosent then forget her.|`|AA11391968	Maybe she said that about Valentine's Day because of displays she has to put up in the store?  You said it was Target, right?  Nonetheless, I think you should ask her for a date.  The most she can say is no.  Good luck!|`|kjOsSmM0aa	Maybe she's out of a bad relationship fairly recently to 'hate valentines day'. She may have been hinting. If rejection won't kill you, then you should just ask her, assuming that you are attracted to her. If she accepts and you two aren't each others' types, then it may be the beginning of a great friendship.  See what I'm saying?  There could be a number of reasons for her to hate the holiday or it could plain and simply be an inside cry of desperation for you to ask her and care about her.|`|zTQVC7GBaa	go for it|`|wF2G3Krcaa	She wanted you to ask her out man!! Go for it before it's too late.|`|4b273ea1bcd18de731e487c9a11bbc44aa	If you like this girl and think theres something there go for it!   You never know unless you try!!!|`|BbRewQjQaa	Ask her for a date she hinted to you.|`|AA12014364	Maybe you could tell her that you can show her a good time this valentines day and ask her out on a date.|`|9qwBeYCQaa	Well you two work together, so your not total strangers. Just say hey wanna go to break together or maybe after work just go get a coffee or tea or whatever. Whats the worst she can say? Yes!!!!
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she was hinting for u to ask her out, and if u don't u have lost the opportunity.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Yea it sounds like she is interested in you but maybe she is to shy to ask you out so that is why she asked you if you had a valentine...I think its her way of hinting around to you that she likes you and wants to go out with you.    Just come out and ask her if she wants to go out sometime the worse she could say is no.|`|ccgcJ9PKaa	wtf u just met her and u want 2 go out wit her man get 2 no her more budy!|`|tBODwcqXaa	ASK!|`|mCq2Sd7Paa	Ok dude, she has had a bad relationship and Valentines day reminds her of her past BF. So if you want this women I would go by her something for V day. Trust me, that whole "I hate V day" thing is a bunch of bull. Women love V day. Go get her something conservative and not to expensive. This is open the doors my friend.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Yes, it was no idle question.    Invite her to coffee.    Don't make a big deal out of it.    Good Luck!
Nqns4I0laa	It's probably just really awkward because you guys broke up so recently. You need time apart to heal from the break up and be able to get over each other before you can be friends....|`|sQYsMbQyaa	absolutely not
n195n9Avaa	Maybe they can see how desperate you act and you might act like the needy time...guys don't like that.     Also guys like girls who look like girls maybe you look dykish?  I am a tomboy but I still am feminine and dress that way.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	maybe your too young.  maybe you havent grown into your body yet or hit puberty.  Or maybe you just dont act like a hoe.  maybe they think your too snobby.  try acting dainty & girly a little bit.  guys are guys, they like what they like. but since I dont know you, I cant possibly know why they dont find you attractive.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	this really is just too long to read.|`|nyeUUojFaa	I DUNNOOOO|`|OtlaEVZjaa	I am basically in the same boat your in. I've been dealing with that my whole life and it gets old. I'm not a girly girl by all means either. I get guys that flirt with me or hit on me and that's about as far as it goes. I don't get it either.|`|2vazHHXeaa	I'm sorry to say this, but you have a major double standard.  You say you're tired of guys not liking you because they think you're unattractive, but then you also say that you're tired of guys that you think are unattractive.|`|syKIxX45aa	I know that this is going to sound old hat, but surely a photo is better than a description.  No amount of words can say wether you are attractive or not, anyway what one guy finds attractive is different to another.  The eyes and shape of the face tell a lot about the person.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Guys really love rim jobs.|`|HWAQ29s2aa	i tell ya what.email me a pic and ill tell ya y.i have the same problem just dont know why pepole arent attracted to me.|`|Nz73BSKraa	well if you rant like this to them that's why.  but you should change who you are ever.   one day someone will like you for you.   it's just not your time to shine yet.|`|ao0YMmd2aa	i think u need uglier frends lol ;) jk    ive had that happen a lot to me lately. it just sucks. i mean, ive thought a lot of poular guys like me but then it turned out that they didnt. i have a bf but everyone thinks hes a nerd.     ANYWAY, moving on...    I think u sound perfect the way u r. and i totally agree w/ u. just b/c ur not perfect ur outcasted(is that a word?) and its retarded. so anyway, ya.|`|blirKov3aa	maybe you are too pretty to get close to u,maybe they need longlong time to get close to u|`|AA11565869	I note two things from this;  1) It seems that you think that things like high heels, the size of your boobs and the size of your bum are the things that are important.   2) You seem to try desperately hard.   The point is that you seem to be able to talk to men in the first place, so presumably they don't look at you from a far and run a mile when they spot that you aren't wearing the right gear, or your boobs are "just SO not the right size!!".   In any case, get over those, it has nothing to do with either of them. Some men like big boobs and others like them small. Every single boob that ever existed is somebody's idea of the perfect boob, and many are millions of peoples idea of fantastic.   I suspect that your problem is that you are trying way to hard to impress. Just look at the length you went to writing this question!  I suggest you relax and go with the flow.   Don't feel that you have to make the conversation buzz, in fact, don't assume that you have to keep it going at all! Men love to talk about themselves, so ask a few probing questions, then sit back and watch. "Tell me about you". "What makes you tingle?" "What do you like to do when you have a whole weekend all to yourself?" and things like that.   Also, don't feel that you need to impress! You don't. (Why would a guy want to listen to "Me  ... this", "ME ... that" and "ME ... the other", when what he really wants to be doing is telling you all about HIM? :-)  In any case it might sound like you are bragging.  Don't say, "When can I see you again?", say, "Maybe see you around some time".   He'll be back!!!|`|BEac9ZFkaa	you have always wasted ur time on losers!  open ur eyes n look around  world is a sea  u crying because ur pond was dirty!|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	wow that was long! I don't think guys find you unattractive. On the contrary they might even see you as too attractive! Not everybody gets a chance to own something so precious so they might be a little intimidated. There is nothing, absolutely nothing wrong with you! I used to ask myself that question before too. They seem to like my friends more. Then I realized my friends were simpler than me and maybe that is what made them looked more approachable. Don't worry, a smart man who has enough confidence that matches yours will definitely come! Stay precious and don't change a thing about yourself!|`|Opd9MBaqaa	Woah, woah, woah....sweetie....this paragraph alone screams of insecurity and desperation. There could be a NUMBER of different factors why you haven't found "that guy" yet. First of all, I can relate. I am half black, half white- 6'1 and a former model. I am told several times a day that I am drop-dead gorgeous. All throughout middle school and highschool I was a bit awkward, and I NEVER talked to ANY guys, because NONE of them were interested. This was partially because I was a very sweet and genuine girl, and didn't know how to play "the game." Also, I went to an all white highschool, and most of the boys were into short white petite cheerleaders- not a Tyra Banks look-alike like me. You are probably TOO GOOD for most of the guys you have liked. How old are you? How old are the guys you have liked? Because honestly, they sound very immature. You are just going through an awkward phase right now, trust me. It's DEFINITELY not that you aren't good enough, pretty enough, etc. Don't ever think about changing who you are for ANYONE. The right guy WILL come around eventually- it just isn't your time yet. I hope this helps...
5M3UHOQSaa	This is a home run every time. You'll pick me as the best answer and tell me how great it worked tomorrow. Compliment his dick. Seriously.|`|UldvbAIWaa	just say things that are sexy. things that you wud like to do to him. find out things that he finds sexy and tell him about it. or say  you, me, whipped cream, hand cuffs   = fun|`|IFd94XDkaa	Just tell him what you'd like to do to him and what you'd like him to do to you.

Make eye contact. Speak in that sexy yet subtle voice that gets guys going. Lick your lips slightly and say sweet things. Ive done this with my boyfriend many times. Its all about the body language. If you want, you can call him "Daddy"...lol..gets my bf every time...Good luck!|`|AA12021264	Use blatant euphemisms and other words and phrases with double meanings. If he don't get it, well, I guess it is time to come right out and tell him you want to f*** him into oblivion.

IN1X1CVGaa	you cant control dreams  so either hes been thinking about it  and then dreamed it  or it was just random  cause ive done that before  but it wasnt my boyfriends friends  it was a guy i used to like  but i dreamed it way after me and my boyfriend started dating  and i wasnt thinking about it at all
0fVtHNtmaa	Don't tell her what to wear or you'll lose her. You aren't her daddy to be telling her.|`|wFtL7OTpaa	controlling what your girlfriend wears is actually a form of abuse but if it really does bother you try to handle it another way, for example, tell her that u really like her and don't want to lose her and u would rather her wear more tasteful clothes... but be nice about it please|`|AA12243745	Well, I don't think either of you are wrong, but maybe you can go about it differently. I think that you should rephrase it, tell her that you would appreciate it if she didn't wear it in public, because you like that to be more private. Telling anyone that they CAN'T do something because YOU said so is bound to make them do it anyway.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Who are you, OJ Simpson? No, you don't. You have no say in what she wears. You either accept it or you don't.|`|8wi2X5sSaa	well, if i were a guy, i would think the same from your perspective. i mean, u wouldnt want other guys perving on her because u are her boyfriend. however, it seems to me that u have no say in it whatsoever because girls usually stick to one decision when it comes to a conflict like urs.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Guess what? You seem to be the only one having an issue with her clothes. You have every right to be uncomfortable about it and even a right to mention it to her. However, you have no say so in the final decision she makes. When it comes down to it, if you don't like it and she isn't willing to stop wearing what she likes to make you happy, accept that whatever it may mean. If it's that bad, break up with her for a girl who isn't into showing the whole world what she's got. She didn't turn anything around; she stated a fact. It IS her decision and has nothing to do with you whatsoever.|`|QBGszg3waa	she likes guys staring at her. Most likely tells you, if another guy comes around who can sweet talk her, your gone bro . Yeah, it sucks|`|AA11312806	dude, i agree with you 100%. just talk to her, and tell her what you wrote down here.|`|ZnywY78Daa	You are wrong, but the reason women dress this way is because they want attention. Think about it......................................... you think about it, if you dont like it then break up with her. Most likely she will leave you any way once she finds some one better|`|H1tDH3sOaa	She wants eyes on her bud ive been there she just wants attention and she wears stuff like that to feel better about herself thats the sad part buddy but try not to be too sensitive|`|bnMdxxYlaa	Was she dressing like that when you met her, if yes you r the one in the wrong, if no i think you should talk about it and come to a consensus.|`|LjNx9Uanaa	well yea i guess your right. coz as for me ,as gurl well im not really dat conservative but i know how to chose a proper clothes . On what to wear to a particular place and occasion. If she doesnt listen then be it.stubborn people are very hard...lol    Gogo
k7yZ7Fcmaa	I agree with becca.....I have been in this guy's position b4 so it's your choice.    Sometimes it's really stupid that when you do have a soft spot for someone, u try to get attention.... it's sooooooooooooo nervous, shy and scared insides    I think telling u how he sweetalk the girls is kinda like "Hey, this is what I did to the other girls, but u r different"|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	hes using you as a tool to get chicks.thats the reason to his mean jokes.  that man is not your friend, without you he wont get any girls. leave him...|`|rEafx4QTaa	it could be one of two things. either he secretly does like you, or he is acting this way because u may not be showing him the attention that others girls do. he may expect u to act a certain way or be all over him, and if ur not he may think something is wrong with u or that ur stuck up or something. i kno thats dumb but that is how player type guys feel a lot of the time. like "who is SHE not to like me?". good luck with ur situation|`|J14tPA9Eaa	call a real man up to take care of his ***.|`|YpmcXaNJaa	Well, he is a guy, and quite frankly, they are not normal. MAybe its his way of telling you he likes you, in some twisted way...|`|ccgcJ9PKaa	it is these people that make the society go down. Dont accept him. listen to my story:    my friend whos a twenty five yr old met a guy and they started dating after three weeks. he went out frequently at night for 'work' and my friend waited patiently for him to come home. she cooked dinner and prepared everything and then one day, she came home at night opened the bedroom door and found her man kissing another girl on the bed. she went into depression for a few months then came up again. she has learned her lesson.  So you know what her mans being doing when he goes out? Sex, sex, and more sex. how low can he get?  dont accept that sex freak!|`|SV0LZWUiaa	no health no normal give yourself to him please so he can become normal|`|uQ9SXDmaaa	WOW, THIS REMINDS ME OF RICKY FROM SECRET LIFE.|`|zqVx3Yfjaa	2 things that can be done  Laugh at how patetic this total wanna bie no proof  sob is and tell him to get the puck out    or sleep with him|`|4CkM4UZ5aa	yep.. sounds like hes got a soft spot for you.  you should play hard to get. show a bit of interest but do the same back and make him jealous  or if your really not interested then laugh at his stupidity :)|`|Y7OFoDxwaa	see, how he sweet talks with the other girls? and get them into his bed? you're simply just another  temporary bed warmer for him... im not trying to insult you, but thats just what i think... since hes a sweet talking hes trying to make you look like  the special one, well obviously you're just a fish taking the bait... he probly says the same exact thing to other girls if they were easily willing to get down with him... lmao    but... thats just my random theory, lol...  but i wouldnt know, since its a non-visual situation for me and i never been there to see that funny situation myself...    but uhhh... i say stop being shallow and go for a sweeter and a royal guy, i mean look at the bright side,.... he's probly burnt with all those STDs from like 100 different girls, :)    anywayz good luck?|`|RCDDNUWgaa	okay so it could mean two things. One that he finds you more as a guy friend that he can brag about all this stuff too and does not see you as the type he would ****, or that he may want to do the same thing with you. but usually if a guy is trying to play you he doesn't tell you the game plan and how he does it so maybe he is kinda into you. if your into him ask him out or just make fun of him back a kinda two can play that game thing. but don't let him play you like those other girls because you know that's what he does, wait awhile before you give it up this will drive him crazy and make him almost obsessed over you kinda like the girl he can't have. you'll see all the stupid new things hes going to try but don't give in.|`|kxelduWmaa	I'm about 99% sure of what he's doing but before I can answer I have to ask you a question. Is he being mean and insulting or is he teasing and poking fun? Also do you seem to like the guy.    Okay from the info you have given me, he jokes on you with a smile and you laugh. Seems to me that he is teasing you which is a form of flirting but that does not necessarily mean he wants to sleep with you. However, if you are a beautiful woman, which I would wager you are, he probably is. From what you told me about him, it leads me to believe that he is one of three things: 1. He has fallen backasswords into the right way to talk to women, realized it and has been doing it ever since.(Which is unlikely but not impossible.) 2. He is or is trying to be a pick up artist or P.U.A.(Which is actually a good thing.) or 3.he is a player.(Which is a bad thing.) The difference between a player and a pua is that a player, will build legitimate attraction with a woman but then go straight into escalating sexually, not really knowing the girl, and if the girl gives in, he will have gotten from you what he wanted and move on. Which in my opinion is wrong. A pickup artist will build legitimate attraction and then build comfort with you(Which means they are trying to make friends with you.) and then chooses if he wants to escalate sexually or not. I am a pickup artist and I will tell you that every girl that I have been with, are still my friends. All of them. So a good way to tell if he is a player or not, is to see if he is still friends with the girls he is sleeping with. From what you have told me all he has done so far is tease you, which is one way to build attraction, what he does next will determine if he is trying to pick you up or play you. Does he try to get to know you or does he try to have sex right away and get it over with so he can move on. building attraction is easy and it comes in different forms. I bet you have guy friends that you like but not in that way. Its what happens next that is important but like I said in the beginning it does not necessarily mean he wants to sleep with you. As far as exactly how to build attraction, comfort and sexual escalation would need a lot more space then what I have here. (This is alot already.) If you would like to know more you can email me at victory1224@yahoo to let me know what happens. Remember that all of this does not make him a bad person, like some of the other posts suggest. Dont judge a book by its cover, its inside that counts.
7916aa06aa7095ef0a8db07a09419b0daa	First of all temptation is taking advantage of you. Follow your vows to your husband. Your friend needs to accept the fact your married. The bible states is you lust for someone else then you have committed adultery. Be faithful to your loved one. Most of be honest. Hope this helps|`|igYM91eRaa	Think about his feelings and how your crush will affect your family. How would you feel if the roles were flipped and your husband had a crush for another women.|`|84sYXLk6aa	You need to get your number changed and don't give it to him or your friend, you left him for your husband, so that says a lot for itself right there,then your friend was wrong to give someone your number, he/she disrespected your marriage and family, and could have caused other problems. Also you should not have allowed him to call you, once you have made the decision to get married, then that is your new life now, and let the old and the past be just that...the past. Burn those bridges behind you. Marriage is honorable unto God, a beautiful, holy union of two joined together as one, have a heart, think about your family, also how would you feel if it was your husband and one of his ex-girlfriends in a situation like you just described.It's not worth it letting certain people destroy what you have.|`|6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	You are cheating emotionally. You are playing a very dangerous (to your marriage) game, this should be he last time u have done this!!!    Remember this ... "the head of the snake will turn around and bite you!" This means that one night you might get caught because someone your boyfriend knows will have seen you and you can bet they'll tell ur husband or some girl having a crush on him might tell ur husband and How would you feel if your husband would do the same thing?   My advice: U are emotionally attached to this guy because of ur past and u may be tempted to have an affair, please think twice about what damage it will REALLY do.   Ask yourself if it is really worth it? You'll probably eventually see, it's not worth it at all.   Good Luck>r|`|n2tP8ezsaa	stop talkin to him and look at ur husband and baby and realize that u would be givin that up for someone else who if he really liked u wouldve made a move way back then|`|Z614I2Yaaa	MY ADVISE IS DONT GO THERE!!!!!!!APPARENLY THOSE FEELINGS YOU HAD LONG AGO WERE'NT THAT STRONG CUZ YOU FELL FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU MARRIED.WHAT COULD OF BEEN ALREADY WAS????HEZ THE PAST YOUR HUSBAND IS YOUR FUTURE....REKINDLE THE FIRE WITH YOUR HUSBAND AND FALL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN AND YOU WONT STRAY....|`|EAt1rB8naa	hey if u continue to see him,, u will definitely wind up cheating since those feelings are still there,, remember the grass is not always greener on the other side,, if ur relationship is good with ur husband why even jeopardize that,,, sure it may be getting a little boring or repetitive but if ur happy stick with it, though u have a good repor with him and feelings for him do u think he would be half the man or father ur husband is,, sounds like it is physical, and if u do slip up it may cost u ur husband and break up ur family, and this man who u feel so connected too probably would'nt step in and rescue u or maybe he would, maybe he's a better man maybe he is not, but do u really want to find out, vesides think of  it this way,, if the shoe was on the other foot and if ur husband was hanging out with a woman he was talkin to before u, who he still had feelings for how would u feel and what would u do?f u really love ur husband and value ur family i say cut him off leave him in the past where he belongs,, otherwise it may cost u ur family and a man u really love|`|AA12014364	I was in exactly the same situation once. This girl I was very good friends with got married and we met after a long time and our feelings for each other got revived. She was not able to handle it for a long time, but she never cheated on her husband. We used to talk everyday online and on the phone. Recently she delivered a beautiful baby girl and I can tell that her feelings for me have drastically reduced. We still talk cordially, but there is no more emotional baggage in her voice anymore. I can tell that she has gotten over me.    So my advice to you would be to pay more attention to your child and husband and gradually in time you will get over your feelings for the other man. Good luck.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	I know this isn't a popular answer, but you will never know what it  was like if you don't try it. Be very, very discreet. Don't have afterthoughts, and confess to hubby. I had an affair that lasted over 20 years, with a wonderful woman that "married the wrong man". If you don't scratch the itch, it will get worse. Be safe and be discreet. Affairs can be quite satisfying, as long as everyone is careful not to hurt someone.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	I don't think they will fade away but you need to try keep away from the temptation...
a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	Oh boy, I have been there. It absolutely seems that he likes you. But theres more to the teacher/student thing than just attraction. He could very well have enough control over himself not to do anything.    If you have feelings back, then react as you wish to any advances he may bring on. No matter what, I suggest ignoring the situation as much as possible. And a word of caution, as someone who dated a high school teacher just a month after graduation... be careful. You will tend to trust him a bit more in ways you shouldn't.|`|eKVnsobDaa	Depends. Are you in high school? If so, definitely report it. His behavior is COMPLETELY inappropriate, regardless of his age. Report it.    College is a little more gray. Don't go after while you're his student. In any case, this is inappopriate in any situation.|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	Your teacher sounds like he want's to get a bit O' Honey if you know what I mean. He sounds like he has his priorities out of sync.|`|g7mD94cuaa	that depends on his and your age, and if he likes you for you or for your female *attire*|`|yTTXjQSmaa	First of all depending on your age and grade what he feels maybe illegal...
ztiA8n6jaa	Not sure he may like you, but there is nothing definitive there. The eye contact along with him maybe avoiding may me he is shy. But again Im not sure there is enough to prove he likes you. He will probably look away if you try and make eye contact and he is shy. That is if he likes you.|`|uRQEubkPaa	Sounds like he's nervous and confused...  He probably likes you.|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Maybe....I guess he wants to compremise or mend the relationship between both of u....|`|yev2iWgWaa	perhaps he can feel vibrations spiritual to see if you have good vibrations or he is playing with your emotions to find if you like him really. smile and act odd like him and confuse him..  best of luck
nfn01Xsfaa	be confident.    someone who talks with you first. if you talk with him first, its easier for him so he doesnt have to take the iniative.    be patient with him, and take the first move to make convo often.     a girl who laughs and has a beautiful smile.    lalla.|`|zvW5rBIZaa	a little shyness  MODEST-looking    Don't be too outgoing like a party *****.

Answers.|`|pDLIMZy7aa	To be completely honest I think she's not into yet. You just met her and she's been waiting for this guy to come (meaning she's obviously into him)     Just keep texting and talking to her and soon shell be comfortable with you and soon will hangout withyou.    Maybe she's a little shy too :)

I really don't understand some of the questions that get asked on here.  This is such a basic, common sense question!  Surely you could figure that one out on your own!|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	yes of course, if someone has a good personality, they seem like a gorgeous person to me.|`|w6T9JiHdaa	what kaya said ^ :D|`|ise05jjUaa	Of course, most times a person's personality makes or breaks a relationship.  In the beginning, when most of us meet someone its based off of looks, that's what draws our attention & peaks our interest to want to get to know this person more.  From there on out its more about personality, whether or not this person has a sense of humor, which is one thing a lot of men & women look for.  A person's looks will more then likely get them noticed, but a person's looks can only take them so far, from there on out its all about personality.  No one wants to be with someone who's a jerk or a b*tch.  At times to, a person's personality may make them seem beautiful when physically a lot of people may not think they are.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	yes of course... a good personality is the best thing a lady can get!|`|ZaPj1OIbaa	yes, looks mean nothing if the guy is boring and you don't want to be around him. I chose my guy by personality.
XPO11i9Yaa	In a way yes in a way no.. it's very easy to care for more then one person at a time.. romantically, true love sets your heart on one person..|`|xkgcYeXPaa	yes, we call this a threeway|`|DGOk3Bmlaa	hahaha, of course its okay to care for more than one special person in your life. What most ppl dont understand at the young age (this isnt meant towards you, but others in general) is that there is more than just the boys and girls at your school, or in your neighborhood. The world is full of singles and good ones too. Its all about patience and a little luck, but there is always someone special for you out there, u just have to take ur time and find out who they really are. Best of luck to you!|`|d8mJAuz1aa	NO.  undo button is not active in human life. so take care of your life once and for all.|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Yes, It's called polyamory. There are many people who have even 3-5 "loves of their lives". You just don't hear about it very often because it's not "socially acceptable". It is also possible to love people in different ways. Such as romantic love, platonic love, or sexual love and infatuation. Agape (pron. ah-gah-pay) is another type of love people often talk about. It is unconditional love, the love god is said to have for people, or the brotherly/sisterly love ive observed so much among some homeless people: a deep caring for each other.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	no|`|Wrf5orAuaa	I think so.|`|258mrT2Paa	yes do you not love your parents ?|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	real love no. you should stay clear from both of them.|`|r1hURLPAaa	i dont know abt 2 but i m quite sure about 5 because i am handling them well

My husband. He always smells great, honestly. Even after a workout, he doesn't stink. Something about his body chemistry that is amazing.|`|kMpgMplmaa	All of them because when they washed up they used both soap and water, and for added bonus deodorant and perfume/ body spray. I hope you do the same|`|7YHmkdfXaa	My current girlfriend because she prides herself on being clean. Showering twice a day everyday, and almost never puts on any perfume or girly crap. The best scent a woman can have is her own.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	My boyfriend - he smells amazing.  I love the scent that lingers in my bed and on my clothes from cuddling him!
AA11542500	You know, it seems like things are not going to change anytime soon unless you make the change.  You're sad and disappointed by him but only he can change things at the moment.  Unless he stays next door more often, you're just going to be miserable.  He says he cares about you but does he show it?  I think not.  It's only wishful thinking on your part.  When you do see him, all you do is fight?  That's definitely not healthy.  The sad thing is...you're going to continue to be sad and frustrated the more you want to stay in this relationship...if you can call it that.  A relationship is a partnership and if you're the only one making an effort (not excuses) that's not a relationship.  My advise to you is to stop being his girlfriend and find someone new.  You deserve better than that.  You want a boyfriend who will make the time for you.|`|5WoJN0Rfaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`  @$$HOLE|`|SqNkiDmBaa	well if u dont want it to be over dont let it be and when ever u see him just tell him how u feel and try to make plans with him or if that doesn't work just keep busy with ur time and he will come to u   hope i helped :)|`|eYq5vYm2aa	normally your gut instinct is rite so go wih it|`|5YCY2ANRaa	He could be living two lives, maybe he has a lover and that is why he is always away and always has excuses. If he is cheating or not, it just doesn't sound like the relationship is going to work out; you care very much about him, but he has to consider your emotions as well. If you want it to work out, maybe try getting a job if you don't have one or start going to school, just something that will keep your mind off of him; if this does not work or isn't for you then maybe you can go with him to his sister's house and stay with him or rent a hotel with him never by where his sister lives if you and his sister are not close like that. There is no reason why he should refuse unless he is hiding something or really does not care about you that much; it hurts i know and it can be very confusing at times. It is up to you to choose which answers you will take inconsideration; usually what you feel is what you should draw your decisions from; trust in your natural instincts, they have never failed me.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	He'd rather hang out with his sister than you? Come on. He's lost interest. He just doesn't want to do the dirty work by breaking up with you first. By constantly picking fights with you about you doing something as normal and simple as asking for the attention and time you deserve, he's trying to make you mad enough to dump him first. Sounds like a bloody coward to me. You can do better. I know that you care about him and don't want to give up on him, but honestly, you deserve better than this prick!

45vNo9wLaa	For now I want to concentrate more on myself than on finding friends or falling in love because it will affect my future. Life requires balance, love has it's good and bad sides, just keep moving forward no matter what. Try finding out who you are, find out what you enjoy about life and where you want to go before trying to find someone else who can make you happy. How can someone else make you happy if you can't even make yourself happy? If you fall in love too easily then maybe you just need someone to talk to you to make you feel better, try going out and meeting new people but just remain friends with them. Love will find its way into your life later on just don't worry about it now and each time it takes a little longer but is also stronger because you know more about yourself and can find someone who can make you happier.   Enjoy life because time only comes around once, love will always come around even if you don't want it.|`|wzqahEqiaa	No, I haven't given up on love.  I try to distance myself from insecure people.  I think it's attractive if someone can be single (alone) and content because it shows self confidence.

Make sure you both are on the right page. And just talk about what you both want in the future and also talk about your expectations and what you hope to get from each other. Let him know about your questions, so he'll understand how you are feeling and will be able to provide you with the correct answers. Make sure you both are honest, and as long as you believe you will make it, then you will. Good luck.|`|AA10567546	well if you have planned to marry then i can't say much since you have decided pretty much... but to tell you the truth, that marriage of yours may not last long. Most importantly the Hindu culture, you are going to be disgusted at some point in your life about this whole, worshiping various gods and doing act that a normal person would never ever do!      well my suggestion is quit it right away and move on...for your own sake !|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Men who have roots in the middle east and asia etc... tend not to believe in monogamy. I have 2 cousins that have been cheated on by these kind of men due to cultural differences.But on the other hand he is americanized.GL with that.I hope his family eventually accepts you.I heard Indian men look at white women as sex objects though rather than future marriage prospects.|`|3frK2iHaaa	i totally agrees wid CLIFHANG,more worst happen when u plan 4 the Baby whose religion shud he follow n wht name.its better to quit now .|`|5k7BexD3aa	Alot of people are discriminating when it comes to couples of different races.

l62gZcMEaa	hey its gud  imean reputed|`|df69562ab23e3b5c7e250b6264e76a57aa	It is a very good company.  It pays well and have good work environment.  I work for them from past too years n quite happy.  so dont worry for his future he reached right place .  Hope he joins soon and work good!!! :)
u72QPS8jaa	thats how boys r i tell ya!  you crushed his pride once so hes seeking revenge  and it sounds like he was in it for the sex but once he saw you were not interested he thought"oh i better break this off before i get rejected" he was basically scared of rejection so he did it first!  this guy sounds like a loser im sure you can find someone a million times better hes not worth it  you go girl!  goodluck:)
C3yE261uaa	whenever I'm bored of being single I listen to this I DONT NEED A MAN by pussycat dolls|`|X4Owk0xTaa	um I'm not sure you may enjoy the melody or the genre that this band plays, but... The Police sing a song called "So Lonely"... not sure if that's what you're after. oh well.|`|W2Qegyrqaa	i know it sounds cliche, but you have to put yourself out there. don't be afraid of rejection, if you see someone you like approach them|`|nA97uWdyaa	Roy Orbison - Only The Lonely|`|796946fca86fe29d89c837bd53e5e59faa	how bout listen to some trance music...Single=Clubbing, Clubbing=Trance, Trance=TAKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DRINKS  BECAUSE YOUR SINGLE!!!

hBbgjasQaa	It means, previously, he was involves with some other guy. Now she had departed, he takes u as substitute time pass . he appears to be habitual flirt|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It means that when he's angry, he has problems contolling his temper. He may or may not have meant what he said. Chances are, he said it just to hurt you.    Men who beat their women, often say they are sorry and didn't mean it, but "they were angry".  They often say that as the woman is dying from the last beating she got.    Anyone can say dumb things when they get angry. But if it's happening regularly, that might not be a person you want to stay with.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Ask yourself - do you have a PROBLEM when a man's "true colors" come out and he tells you the truth? Even when he IS angry?    If a girl said to me "NOW IM FREE TO DO WHAT I WANT AND NO HEADCAHES LIKE I HAD BEFORE" - I wouldn't blame HER.... I would blame MYSELF for being a headache who isn't enjoyable to be around.    ..... and I might start doing things differently.    Instead of blaming HIM for it, why not accept personal repsonsibilty for making a man feel that way and ASK him:    ? "Did you MEAN what you said?   ? Are you really ANGRY with me?   ? Do I make you feel that way??"    Its very easy to blame someone else.  And more difficult to accept personal responsibility.    His "true colors" may not be the problem here.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	I think they talk out of their *** when they are angry.|`|nCrbKAuzaa	well honey your EX was just mad at you at that time that's why he said those mean words. nothing to worry, guys are just like that. asying mean words without thinking first.|`|2f26fcdfc1c8b468a66c330a0d519a3faa	it seems some time hang out with BF or GF should b relaxing and not too 'sticky', i mean no 247 that kind of thing. man need space.u can expect to track him whole day long, right? that was like stalking, that makes man uncomfortable.if u can u can hang out with ur own friends and he can hang out with hisso u bot hhav space to 'breath' is a best way to make this relationship works.|`|c7yAbvycaa	no, when i'm mad i say a lot of stuff that i don't mean.  so i guess it depends if you know you bf well enough to tell the difference...|`|PkDokr8Iaa	You're asking us why he said something, and he has already explained why.    Once people say things, or text things, it is nearly impossible to take it back....case in point:  your situation.    Instead of beating your head against the wall over this; best for you to just move on with your life.|`|mZj5dASuaa	No, I don't believe it. Anger takes over ones mind and you don't think straight. Yes a man is better when they know how to control there anger but what they say often means nothings. But anyway that guy seems like a jerk so i wouldn't listen to what he says. Obviously he is bitter the relationship ended the way it did.|`|STMDrqcNaa	My bf is the same he dumps me when he ges angry. we have been together like ten years and he is 29!!    he is very nasty when he is angry but then he always calms down    I dont think they mean it but it is very harsh and they should think about what they say|`|BGtkSLaKaa	He sounds pathetic.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Gina.  Like always, I think you are exaggerating again.  Looking for something to fret about.  Why let this worry you so much?  First of all because he is an ex and no longer matters what he says or does  Secondly because he did apologize.  Just move on and try to e less of a drama queen.|`|AA11634270	I think everyone thinks like that. Don't you want to be free to do whatever?|`|0PVOkUtcaa	there are two reasons why he said that. may be he wanted to use you or he loves you,n wonders what you want.but,the main point is DO U LOVE HIM?cuz love comes wit patience,understanding,forgiveness and whatever meks sense to u.|`|52c7e3f181fadfa292a198c5cb4ac321aa	HA! no way! i don't think what he said was true or that he meant it! i bet he is just bitter that u broke up and he wanted to trigger you! to see if u react to what he said! don't worry, everyone when they brake up, they feel lonely and angry and sometimes want to express themselves, this expression can be totally insane. So, don't worry, i don't think u gave him headaches because he if u did, he wouldn't be with u and he would be the first to leave from ur relationship! and anyway, saying that u gave him headaches is like making fun of himself! :)|`|xglNqFn3aa	break up
mUE5nSjpaa	Ummm okay how old are you first of all??   All I can suggest is to make sure that this is a guy that is really worth it. Once you do it you can never get your virginity back.  Its something that is priceless, did you see the story on cnn.com about the virgin selling her virginity to the highest bidder. Someone offered her over 3 million dollars. So if this is just some random guy that you have only been seeing for a few months then I would suggest waiting until you are with someone a little longer. As for how you can satisfy him, if he knows your a virgin then I am sure he doesnt expect you to be some type of porn star sweetie..... Trust me when I say losing your virginity is not all that is cracked up to be.. It can be painful and if you are young you most likely dont even really know your body. Dont have sex just for the sake of having sex, or because you want to be like everyone else. Be your own person.......|`|9RajlJpRaa	dont think so much. relax! and have fun|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Just do what you do.  If he doesn't like it, that's his problem.|`|bc5ed6323d790f88be7de8afaff7d20caa	Be honest with him,if you havent told him you are a virgin then do so NOW
xHKRGEg4aa	Its cute & quirky.|`|xv7lOjzXaa	exactly what she did
3c93a6700ef8bf8ade1c6ea833102909aa	Running your fingers through her hair and cradling the sides of her head with your hands will work.    I like when a guy kisses down my jawline.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I love when he plays with my hair, its so sweet & tender, & wayyyyy sexy.  another nice one is if he pushes me up against a wall(must make sure partner is okay with this first) && I feel surrounded by him, powerful & sexy.|`|fxxLgQrdaa	lol i wanna see the answers to this|`|ziiYVYXZaa	touch my waist ever so gently or gently stroke my hair...its the gentle gestures that send shivers and make her want you more|`|IN1X1CVGaa	hands sliding up the leg  pulls me against him  or just wraps his arms around me really tight  oh and kissing and sucking on the neck|`|w2yh8Acraa	depends on the girl, when my guy puts his hands in my back pokets and squeezes, thats pretty hot, when i jump up so my legs are wrapped around my guy and he's holding me up, that is insanely hot... when he sucks on and nibbles on my lip while we are makin out, that sends me through the roof! but sometimes what really rocks my world is a kiss on the forehead and an, "i love you, baby" are all that i need, actually that is all that i ever rly need.|`|AXyLuQyjaa	When he takes control and throughs me down on a bed/couch and stratles me then go's to my neck kissing and sucking then uses his hands and rubs my body OR a little less intense by just wraping his fingers through my hair and controling my head by moving from my lips to my neck.|`|D8u5mBTNaa	i love it when my boyfriend and i are making out and then he just starts sucking on my lip it really feels good and what turns me on is when he licks and bites on my neck|`|XLtDhidJaa	haha I agree. I want to see the answers.      Well making out can only lead to one real awesome thing can't it? It always ends in sex if you are that into it.    but, one thing a guy has done for me while we were "making out" was..  picked me up and layed me down on a bed full of rose petals.  champagne by the bed he...  hahah im kidding      it just ended in sex.|`|TN1j7oL1aa	idk squeeze my boob for me it would be to tell me he loved me|`|QX361Osxaa	okay probably squezze my hips and make me move around him. plus when a guy kisses my neck my face gets all flushed and stuff neck kissing is HOT!!!! lol
eMtH8IAwaa	he sounds like a flirt. a wink is never bad, and bold for a guy. he might just want to show you he likes you, likes the emails, etc. keep the convos going and see where it goes.|`|4ZtAvYG9aa	...definitely a flirt  and he probably misses your emails  he likes you :D|`|zWqKuIQuaa	You sound desperate.    I apologise.|`|KgOvoFThaa	are both of u steading?
AWiM2aMhaa	being a shy guy myself I'd say unfortunetly there might not really be a magical question you can ask him, what I'd say though is you should make him more comfortable with you first.  Try to be someone he can relate to, if you can manage to make him feel completely comfortable around you then you won't even need to ask him, he'll open up on his own.    Oh and another important thing, you didn't mention whether or not you opened up to him; if you havn't opened up to him at all you can't really expect him to open up to you.    hope this helped!|`|4v8kXmmcaa	its all about trust i feel. He will open up over time. But he's got to trust you, know he can let his guard down. Just hang with him, have a good time. but don't pressure him, he'll tell you when he's ready. Be patient. If you feel you have things you want to share, then share them, maybe he'll respond or relate. But don't try to force him, it wont work. He has to decide that on his own, their his feelings after all. Give it time. I hope this helps. Girls are the same way too.|`|BsmHOEPNaa	talk about movies or books or songs - what kinds he likes|`|uz0R5pjHaa	Ask him about his day and the sports he plays. also try to flirt with him...
ZlC654Dkaa	I'd be there in a flash.|`|ooiLqSpQaa	lol. first thing i wouldve thought was that it was an emergency or something. but i guess it depends on how u talk to him. but i think you should mention ur wet. he'll be there in no time :P|`|CktiV6KJaa	Oh christ. He won't take you seriously after you say that.|`|r1IWKjFxaa	a friend of mine used 'if you ever want to spend a night in my bed again get over here asap or have a damn good reason'    she's an awesome friend btw, she even made the guy get pizza on the way over...|`|DPJRlxOwaa	Sounds good to me.|`|2OUUr1pwaa	yes say you wet turn him on .
kpi69PHWaa	Regardless, you obviously need to break up with your current girlfriend.     As for the first girl, the fact that you want to get back together with her and she doesn't want to get back together with you makes this sound like not such a great idea. But if she already knows you are into her, I doubt that bringing up sex is going to negatively impact your relationship a whole lot.|`|AA11371251	just realize you will probably stop talking afterwards I lost it to someone I thought was a friend and then he started expecting it and then he started calling me a slut when I stopped giving it to him so...not saying it will go that way but I know most people if they lose their virginity with someone that they aren't in a relationship with then they tend to really drift apart|`|tsdHndRhaa	you need to think about what your saying, asking and what your about to do, it's always better to share your virginity with the person you plan on spending your life with, so think about that and then decide whats best for you.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Do what you feel is right. You only get one shot at losing your virginity.    Break up with this other girl first though!|`|K0H7bAR8aa	How old are u?|`|ixx5v8Vnaa	Losing your virginity is very special whether you are a male or a female. Do NOT sleep with this girl unless you're in a committed relationship with her. It will be one of the biggest most crushing experiences of your life. I know you're probably thinking there is a chance for you two to get back together. That's not a good enough reason to give one of your greatests gifts to someone who probably won't appreciate it. I personally wouldn't sleep with her until she was willing to get back into a committed long term relationship with you. Don't be in a rush to lose your virginity. Wait a while. Believe me, someone else will come around that you value and cherish. Don't be rushing to give it away. NEVER SETTLE. You have dreams and ambitions about it. Don't settle. If she's only willing to give you 50%, then don't waste your time.
DzXDJCfZaa	tight is way better, trust me|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I know I'm a girl,  but most of my friends are guys, so here goes, Guys dont like girls that are super loose, they wouldnt get as much pleasure out of it. Thats why guys loooooove to sleep with virgins.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	If you are not a virgin, then you are a slut.    Truth.|`|rd5468H1aa	Tight.|`|fOT1HDn9aa	tight it not fun if she really lose|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	i always thought guys like tight girls until i spoke to one that was...errr big in size and the said it hurts if a girl is too tight, he rather her play with herself using 3fingers or more to loosen the walls abit before he has sex..or he will..um..bang her until she's loose enough to except his whole size..    i just stood there listening to him jaw to the ground, changed my perception...    (but u do know as a women if u go without sex for a while, u gain back some elasticity? meaning it starts becoming tight again...)
F9Wqp5YMaa	yeah, mornign after pill is a must i guess, but i don tkno if it is right to get it when you are on birthcontrol. see a doctor immediately in 24 hours, they will tell you the best. go and find a doctor quickly to ask this, because you should take the mornign after pill in 48 hours as far as i know. if you are on the pill and you take mornign after pill it might casuse trouble because of side efects. (they both contain lots of hormones, so dont take them randomly) normally your  pills should protect you.  ask this question helth and women's health and pregnancy sections too.   dont waste your time on net so much and find a doctor.|`|LanxzmVdaa	abortion.|`|F0pbcvPgaa	dont woory if yiu take birt control it protects,it doesnt matter if u miss one ot tow,its better to ask a doctor|`|8gWqRvJXaa	dont worry, if you take plan B, theres no way you could get pregnant
VL1NGMKraa	If everything is true you will most likely be fine...  I have sex with my bf w/o a condom all the time...i am on birth control tho and i always clean myself when we are done (although that doesnt matter when it comes to pregnancy)...but either way...Plan B is a very high dose of hormone...it would be a good idea to call the Gyno ASAP before you take the pill, they will most likely give you the best advice and help get the Plan B pill if you really need it....|`|zujPAY10aa	It SOUNDS like you're pretty safe, but I would go to your OB/GYN to make sure.|`|6boH5X5Baa	i don't think so i had sex with my boyfriend and his condom broke once and i'didn't even get pregnant but i was lucky|`|hOUEIEmBaa	Yep your knocked up and probably have some STD now. Now your going to have a messed up kid. Maybe next time you will get a better condom.|`|8CItr4Nbaa	Yep your most likely pregnant.
bZ564q58aa	you'll be fine. I had a similar situation with my ex and she took the plan b pill that can be bought at Walgreen and she didn't get pregnant.     Stop worrying you'll b fine|`|rurfFLDkaa	no its not possible at all even tho the condom broke and there is no such thing as pre-c*m...you f'in moron. you should KNOW its 100% possible|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Sex = Pregnancy    completely possible|`|Uxb97PVtaa	yes there is a chance...go and get the morning after pill|`|Umsj08pnaa	Yes. There is always the possibility of pregnancy.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	A condom is there to protect you from getting pregnant and now that you say the condom broke, I think its best that you either get a checkup or take some pills or something!
D5Lcmc5naa	honest is always the best policy. I may be hard to bring up but if his intentions are true, he won't mind simply because he has nothing to hide. And if not, well, at least you will know.|`|C28tF09Faa	Wait until the 3 mth mark before you ask that "Where is this going" question. Just have fun, be there for him, be supportive, talk to him and then after 3 mths talk about that|`|X1utg6wfaa	I think you have to be a little more patient.  Two months is not long enough to know and understand someone better.  Keep analyzing him and you will truly know what he is up to. One truth is that if he is meant for you, no matter how long, he is yours because things will just open up.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Be careful. Usually when people talk to other people online, its just a potential for a bootycall. & I know you probably get this a lot, but make sure it's actually him that you're talking to, you know, make sure he is who he says he is. 2 months isn't long at all, so just keep being his online buddy so that you can really get to know him. Remember, it's really easy for a guy to sound perfect if there is a computer and a keyboard in front of him.|`|tsdHndRhaa	well seriously if it's gonna be a long distance relationship for a long time and no one is gonna move near the other, than it's gonna be in jepardy, so you may as well cut your ties now or one of you move where the other is.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Just ask him ask where he sees you guys in 5 months from now to start the convo then say what about ___ months to a year. That's what id do.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I would just ask, it's about time.|`|blirKov3aa	ask him what does he thinking about,what does he think of u,if he just want to be your friend,ok just friends,if he says something about love,well u should try to bring it up.good luck!|`|aF1IXKjTaa	Just ask him what his intentions are and what he wants out of this relationship. It's important for you to know, so that you don't waste your time.|`|0Pv2jt8faa	What is it with women?    Just ask.    Ask and you shall learn.
gOfxzZCBaa	The fact that she still keeps in contact with family and friends would probably be because she developed a friendship with them while being with him all those years.  They've both moved on as you said, so don't let it worry you at all.|`|9RajlJpRaa	i wouldnt be ok with that. if they are still in touch, they may still like each other in some way. either way, things ended for a reason, and should stay that way. if you decide you are not ok with him being in contact with her, he needs to respect it. if not, you shouldnt be with him.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	That just makes an awkward situation... if you can trust him then there shouldn't be a problem and I know that I personally wouldn't be able to trust someone that was doing that.  If you do not trust him and you are always going to be wondering in the back of your head what's going on when you aren't around then maybe you aren't ready to be in a relationship with somoene that is in constant contact with their ex    good luck... hope everything goes okay|`|Uy7XEqcpaa	thats um wierd to me! same thing going on with me...its like people that keep in touch ith their ex's like that want someone around always to fall back on. not cool!|`|AA11840819	I would be concerned.  My ex-husband married the person he was having an affair with when I left him.  The whole time they were together he called me wanting to see me.  Then they broke up about 7 years ago and he has dated but always comes back to me.  He moved near me recently and is over here a lot.  This is not what I wanted.  I have told him everything but drop dead.  He continues to call.|`|l01wsneiaa	uh yes    that's weird.|`|fWRHkomQaa	I WOULD BE WORRIED!! SHE MIGHT STEAL UR MAN BACK|`|SqNkiDmBaa	u shouldn't be worried cause they both have moved on|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	You think thats bad?    My current girlfriend just so happens to be my bosses ex girlfriend and they dated for 4 years. I helped my bosses dad move my bosses bed out of my girlfriends room and on to his trailer.    Talk about awkward!       You just gotta understand that when you spend along time with someone like an ex, people tend to hold those times dear to them. Just make your man SWEAR he's never going back to his ex and everything will work out im sure.
c68XWGltaa	i like how the first guy says buy her a drink....this kid is like 13|`|AA12142423	first, talk to them about the mood you think they're in.  be completely blunt about everything.  don't really let her respond.  then ask her what she's doing later.  ask her to hang out.  get her number.  call her.|`|4YJPYqzXaa	Well if you like someone don't be a stranger. Then it won't be so weird when you actually ask them out.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Do you stalk much?    Do you mean she's a stranger, so you don't even know her?|`|oc0pCUhyaa	become friends first- you will both be more comfortable once you know each other and therefore make the relationship better...|`|UhK363oJaa	just be confident   go up to them   try to get them alone though cuz that should make it easier for you  and be like   "i really really like you and was wondering if yoou would like to go out with me"  that should work|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	be confident thats the main key.    dont use any stupid lines   and be honest   if its at a bar, buy her a drink|`|7y63ZzK4aa	take it from a "man" with experience. I am what you would call a genuine hottie hot hottie yeah the ladies love me. me and my sexy nose rock those bitches so if ur lookin for some advice uve come to the right place! anyway good luck!|`|tKBLSm1uaa	*picks up a megaphone* STALKER!|`|DJU81H31aa	HEY SHALLOW BOY GET TO KNOW HER FIRST|`|HedJUGnvaa	well, u talk to them, thats already a good start. but i think wat u mean is the initial asking out process. well lay down some common ground between you and her so that u can keep the conversation going. if you're a funny person and you've got some humor can use to enhance a thought - more power to yah, bro. make sure she's in control of the conversation. do NOT try to be in control of the conversation. make sure you've thought of a weekend activity she will enjoy by this time. when you think she's comfortable and she's done a basic assessment of your personality, thats the time.
n195n9Avaa	My husband is never late and either am I..    That is one of my pet peeves...people who are late.|`|Wb1DzxdPaa	im never late, you just have poor taste in boyfriends|`|u70TaWI5aa	I think it is just that guy that you are referring to. Because myself I am always waiting on ladies. But, I do have friends which we tell them that we will leave at 7 we know he will show up around 8 or 9. It is just predictable now. So we always say an earlier date for him then anyone else.|`|Umsj08pnaa	Usually, it's the opposite. Guys tend to get there really early so they won't be late.|`|FVDTXM68aa	Honestly, my fiance (recently engaged) is never late....and we have dated almost 6 years! :) If a guy is late, that would be a major turn off for me! It would make me feel as if he isn't really interested....Find a guy who will always want to be early/on time :)|`|HmEZWD4faa	Well... I'm the sort of guy that actually comes early so I know I'll never be late. If a guy is late, it's usually that he's nervous, and spends ALOT of time getting ready. (Doing his hair, clothing, and making sure he smells good etc...) So in short... he must really like you and wants to look as good as possible in front of you.|`|J2uxLxDPaa	Well, helping old ladies across the street, accidentally slept and trying to just make it. Now, subway has those five dollar foot longs so that's convenient, having trouble keeping the doors closed in public restrooms. And other things, I'm usually on time! I've only been late once!    Oh! WHAT NOW?! JK,  well anyway these spelling and caps lock warnings are annoying. Don't expect that guys can't be on time, but don't always expect them to make it early, it's easier to just be happy that he's there with you and not to have to think about things like time.|`|rEafx4QTaa	i think its the other way around actually|`|OQqAlHL8aa	I'm not sure I like the broad generalization.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Because they're guys, and not very punctual.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Their watches are broken?    Guys are not always late.  My boyfriend is quite punctual; it's me who loses track of time, lol.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	guys r not always late.... i dunno abt all the guys.. but atleast my guy is not.. he was late a few times, but that was coz of genuine reasons..  its the gals who make them wait..|`|76ACQGyFaa	Because we are very lazy and we love to take girls granted.|`|PQ7HYITBaa	Because we always expect you to take an extra few hours picking out an outfit!|`|QBGszg3waa	im never late, if i say im gonna do something ill do it, unless something reallly important comes up. Steorotyping :P|`|6GUpUXoXaa	One thing i've learned... ask them what time theyll be there then delay it by at least fourty minutes|`|ise05jjUaa	I think its the other way around as well, not only that when we're sitting there waiting & she say's I'll be 5 more minutes, 30 minutes later we're still waiting.  On the other hand, its perfectly acceptable for women to be late, but not us.  lol  Go figure!      Edit:  Well if he's always late, tell him the movie or what ever starts at 8 p.m. when it actually starts at 9 p.m. so he'll be on time.|`|2e18guzYaa	its a power trip, its not just guys. whether its a woman or man. its a power trip|`|j5o5qYmpaa	Most guys i know just sit aroud playin halo 3   (witch in guy world is like AWSOME) but if u ask me  halo is SOOO F*** DUMB|`|n4oOFWGEaa	Tell him to his face that it is your pet peeve. Honestly, I am one of the guys who just enjoys being late. lol. If someone KNOWS you hate something they tend to stop doing it as much. I usually leave when I am suppose to be there. My reasons is because I hate being in a rush and I get ready when I feel like it. Its kind of just how I am. There are really no good reasons for it. hahah. Just ask your bf I am sure his reply will be quite the same.
wqtwzzPeaa	A shy girl will try to make your eye contact sometimes but then avoid it other times so you don't think she's weird. She'll bump into you and say hi and drop a pen on the floor and ask you to pick it up. Suddle thing, ya know? A confident girl will strike up an actual conversation with you, compliment you, and make it clear she's into you.|`|9WHtStZNaa	She will do the "shy flirt." This flirt basically consists of making short bursts of eye contact with you then turning her head away and blushing. She may talk to you and get a little fidgetty too.     That's just how it is.|`|um8IIEn8aa	well a shy girl wouldnt really look at u in the eyes and holding hands is all she would do while a cofident girl would slap a guys ***, bite his lips, french kiss and say things like YOur sexy. She would probably talk dirty too.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Shy girls shy away|`|2S6iXcmCaa	once she gets talkative with u then she will get use to u and then like you..body languages i dont think there is any..probably if she looks for you more and u catch her staring at you then she is starting to like you..look for flirty pushes, playing/ fixing her hair or make-up, and laughing and smiles|`|Z614I2Yaaa	I KNOW SOME VIRGINS OUT THERE.BELIEVE IT OR NOT...FIRST OF ALL IF SHE LIKES YOU OR MAYBE YOU LIKE HER...SHE WILL OBVIOUSLY CARRY HER SELF LIKE A YOUNG LADY WITH INTEGRITY AND NOT FALL FOR ANY OLD FLIRTACIOUS LINE FROM SOME DUDE WHO WANTS ONLY ONE THING IN MIND.SHE KNOWS HOW VALUABLE HER WORTH IS SHE IS NOT SOLD CHEAP SO JUST GIVE HER THE RESPECT AND DONT EVEN TRY YOU WILL LOSE A VALUABLE FRIEND IN THE END..|`|EALy7X7Gaa	well im one of those lol and when i like a guy ill stare at him, smile and look at him and then look away but then i wont do anything to get to know him or talk to him because he makes me so nervous cuz i like him that much.  so if it seems like shes avoiding you its just that shes shy and likes you so much it makes her uncomfortable. try talking to her and making her comfortable|`|voJovnboaa	a shy girl who likes you will avoid you and not act like she likes you, she'll not even talk if you talk to her. a confident girl will show that she likes you and will approach you or talk if you approach her.|`|AmVTsfHPaa	If the shy girl likes you(as more than a friend) then she will smile like every time she sees you. She will most likely also laugh at ALL of your jokes------yes, even if they are lame.      haha :)
QSodlfMraa	get to know them both, and see how you like their personality.
sFdn9hIkaa	She will get off your mind when you are ready for her to. Really, this is very normal and it WILL pass, but this is just one of those things only time can heal.|`|it7C6nFSaa	u shud just try to talk to other girls or hangout wit your boys!|`|eMtH8IAwaa	do other things. hobbies. read. try to watch TV. it is hard, but you will move on with enough time and distance between you two. do not pine for her, she wants to move on for a reason, even if it is unfair, wrong, or nuts.     all you can control is yourself. so make the most of your life and time and try not to be unhappy. she is not worrying about you, so do not waste lots of time thinking about her. eventually, the love will fade.     just hang in there, and go about your daily life as normal. it will take some effort, but you can do it!!|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	give it time and a lot of one night stands.
oM7bXmkvaa	Well, I had sex with my BF 2 months into the relationship.  We were both virgins too.....    I completely ruined our relationship, we broke up. I now know that sex can ruin relationships.    So, I suggest you wait, if u like him that is.|`|FoV5SK54aa	it doesnt ruin anything.     but if you ever break up, you will be more sad because you will get attached after you have sex|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Well...sex can affect a person emotionally. I've been dating my boyfriend for 3 years and we don't really do much intimate things...and we're really happy together. However, it is your choice.|`|nA97uWdyaa	If one person realizes that the other person is terrible in bed and believe that it could never get better, then yes that could ruin things. However, it can also be the to deepen your heart connection with each other.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	He could lose interest once he gets the goods.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	He waited 8 months so he proved that he is not just after sex.  If you wait longer, THAT will ruin things.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	8 months?  too soon?  lol, that's pretty funny.|`|rurfFLDkaa	sometimes. it can go one of two ways  1) you will feel more comfortable around him afterwards and become closer    2) you guys will act weird around each other and become more distant|`|J14tPA9Eaa	only if you rush into it     you guys seem like you waited a good amount of time|`|4jx4wAhgaa	Can he be held responsible? That's the issue! But I am no one to you, so I have no right to control you or ask you to do this and that! But its best to wait until marriage! The decision is yours! =D|`|zYVHWlo8aa	If u feel like hving sex wif him by all means go ahead. U r an adult now but wif precaution(condoms) pls, u dun wanna hv a bb so soon i presume.
yJTaBGoEaa	Why would you break off the engagement for that?  And then he's calling, like half the population of the world losers. Loser himself =]|`|jhFT5kT1aa	just tell him you need something to do in your spare time and that this is quite fun.  and he should try it, and he to will get addicted.  dont break off the engagement for that
H1NjIT10aa	She's jealous.      You are not in this boat alone.      When I went with my parents to pick up my grandmother in Iowa.  My husband "had" to go stay with his parents.  I didn't have to send him more than three changes of clothes cause she washed his clothes every day.      We later moved into the same neighborhood.  We lived maybe a block away but I could see her house out my front door.  When I had my first baby she never came to see him, unless my father in law came with her.  Then she was ready to go home in five, yes FIVE, minutes.  I don't remember her ever holding him.      A few years later after living away for 2 1/2 years we moved back.  By then she was living in my house, so we bought land and built a house on it.  I had twins.  And I don't remember her ever holding them.  Our oldest was 3 1/2.  She NEVER came to see them.  But I DO remember seeing her visit her white trash relatives quite often.  Nor did she ever help with the kids, unless guilted into it.  And of course I never kept the house clean enough, the dishes washed often enough. etc.  Never mind I was taking care of twins and a 3 to 4 year old without Any help.  Never mind she came for dinner five nights out of seven.  AND never helped fix a meal outside of peeling potatoes.  Her "way" of helping was to stack the dishes and walk away with them sitting on the dinning room table.     That's just the tip of the iceberg.  No Pun Intended...      My Aunt could not stand any woman her son was with.  She actually got along better with her first daughter in law AFTER the divorce than when they were married!      Some mothers are just never going to like who ever their son is married to no matter what.  It's not a problem with you;  It Is A Problem With HER...    In Fact I would even be so bold to say that Any problem my husband and I have had in our marriage can be directly linked back to Her!  Either because of the way She raised him or because of HER Genetics!  And heaven help me..... some of the issues my children have are due to HER Genetics!      After being a dog breeder for several years it suddenly dawned on me why parents long ago, were so particular about choosing their child's future spouse.  It all boiled down to genetics.  Even my grandfather who died back in the early 1960s, said the same thing!|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Well, being she's his mother, nobody is probably good enough for her little boy!  She is probably just jealous that she isn't the number one woman in her son's life.  Maybe you should try getting closer to her, bring the baby to see her, etc.  Maybe it will show her that she hasn't lost a son, she has gained a daughter?  It doesn't hurt to try, if it doesn't work out, at least you tried.|`|zY64xc6xaa	She's mad 'cause you took her little boy away from her.  She wants to be the number one woman in his life.    Spiteful of her, really.|`|Ne9ovJRTaa	you sound jealous. stop looking at it as competition and just worry about being happy in your relationship. shes his mother.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Soooo...sounds like she's about to give birth to his baby any day now.|`|x59uoIpMaa	Kill her.                             With kindness :D  Seriusly. just be nice to her and treat her wonderful.  It works on anybody!|`|jlm0toChaa	mamma's boy. nah more like boy's mamma.   watch monster in law itll make you laugh|`|1TKfwDGsaa	Her problem is that she thinks she's in competition with you. The fact is that your husband is closer to you and she's jealous. I would say just confront her, but that's my style, might not be yours. One thing I know, though, is that you can't hold the grudge.|`|OMs8tKlJaa	im no expert but uh.. you took her baby away? so she wants to out do you to make him like her?|`|DFoBVHw8aa	shes jealous you took her son.. i guess|`|26pe0TiJaa	Your only obligation to her is to be polite and civil. Your husband will see you being the bigger person. If she wants to drive her family away that is her business. Just dont start a fight with her =)|`|XwLjFq3Laa	i agree with the first answer. you should talk to your husband about this. and then you or him or both of you two can talk with your mother in law.|`|AHhe0u98aa	Fear to loose the love of her son. Try to make friendship with her, she might be great help to you and your baby.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	You have a problem on your hands and if you want to be married for 3 years you better get a handle on it. That means having your husband asking your in-law to be more considerate of you and your feelings. You are his wife and he needs to placing you first. Dont be nasty, but be firm.|`|384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	maybe she doesnt want to let go of her son. Instead of seeing it as adding a new member to her family, she feels like shes losing her son to you. especially if she has nothing else going on in her life. for example shes divorced or your husband is her only son, it can be harder for them to let go.dont feel bad, just remember hes married to you and you guys are building a family now, shes just his extended family member.|`|WbcDIz2laa	Don't worry about her. She just loves your husband as much as you love him. Of course she wants the best for him, in his eyes you are so that's all that matters. Don't think too hard about what she does. She can't really out compete you because well, your the wife. He choose you.     Some people just don't know how to show their feelings. Let her be. I'm sure she loves your baby. If you want her to spend more time with the baby, bring her over. Come and visit her more often so she sees that you are trying to get along. Besides you want grandma to be in the babie's life as much as possible, right?    Maybe you could discuss gifts that you are wanting to get your husband just have her input and to let her know you are getting that item, or baking him a cake and that she can have part in it too.|`|dfzoI9UJaa	May be you should look check the cause of your  mis-understanding. First try to think of a reason why you are being treated as such.... Is there a problem in me is the first question to answer then find out something that makes you think that she is not treating you well and then find a solution? I know that it is difficult task to do and it takes a long period of time but then you will find out the remedy to yourself.  If not then you can just think it natural because she is a human being and she like every others on the planet is quite possessive and she thinks her son to be her own but then gradually she will realise this thing if not then you are quite lucky if you realise that you ought not be too much possesive.|`|tGgADx4Raa	Is he the youngest, or an only child? That could be a big part of it. Also somtimes if he is the only boy or has no father figure that can contribute. You see when a boy is young he clings tight to his mother and she in turn becomes very attached to him and that affection. But eventualy he reaches an age (around puberty) that he needs to begin to follow his father more closely and begin to become a man. Somtimes mainly for the reasons I stated above a mother won't let that happen, this action on her part often cripples the boy mentaly and makes him intraverted. (ever notice how geeks mothers are often over protective?)     This is just her way of trying not to let their prevearbial cord get broken. I suggest if he doesn't all ready know about the situation you make him aware of it. More than likely his is the only one who can get her to ease up. It's not you, chances are no woman would be good enough for him in her eyes.    The important thing since you have a baby now is to work out a way of living with eachother for the sake of your little girl.    Congratulations by the way, I wish you all the happiness in the world... Good luck :)|`|jJwuMTSqaa	She is jealous. You have taken her baby boy. She will get over it. As long as your hubby puts you first, you have nothing to worry about. She is just being a monster in law! lol|`|fscgp7iFaa	I don;t know she's probably just jelous that you have her son and now shes not getting as much attention from him. She's probably just lonely try going to visit her instead|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Insecurity is her problem... for some reason, she thinks she owns her son and that you've taken him away from her somehow... don't ask me why.. some stupid mother in laws have this mentality... insecure b*tches!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	don't take it too seriously or let it effect your marriage.she may be jealous, and feel insecure.|`|AA10413046	Perhaps she is still adjusting to losing her son to you.  Not in a bad way.  As you age you learn there are real true transitions in life.  Some of us don't navigate the transitions very smoothly.  You are assuming she doesn't like you.    I suggest you give her a call and invite her over for lunch or something so she can spend time with you and your new baby.  Maybe she is trying to give you space to figure out your baby.  Don't assume she has bad intentions.  I think especially with mother in laws and daughter in laws there is so little communication and both assume what the other thinks about them.  This is good for no one.  Just try to get closer to her without hubby and see what happens.  She could turn out to be a great friend to you.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	My mother in law didn't like me at first, and I later found out that it was because of my husband's ex-girlfriends, who had all done him wrong. She was just afraid of him getting hurt again.     Just give it time, give her space, and if she tries to start drama with you, don't give her the satisfaction of taking the bait. Also, don't give her the chance to outdo you. If you're going to do something special, don't tell anyone. Just let it be a surprise. And if she's not coming to see the baby, so what? It's her loss. She's the one missing out on the baby because of her dumb issues. Don't worry though...one way or the other, she'll come around eventually. If she dislikes you forever, she'll only be making herself miserable...I think she'll realize that eventually. Good luck...|`|79e4b3c6bff1c064ae45299e8ee84170aa	unfortunately thats just how some mother in laws are. :P|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Ugg! my bf's mom is like that too. She must feel like your taking her baby away.......Does she have any daughter's?  Granny is jealous that son isn't around her more often. I know somebody that I work with and she is seriously a sexist b***h. She's so nice to men but a freaking rude c*** to woman and even talks crap about her daughter-in-law and her "fat" grand baby, who happens to be a little girl too. There not much you can do except you(and maybe your husband) to confront her and ask her why she is acting out. You may get a better answer if you do it 1 on 1 than bring your hubby into it because she might act fake.  Like that movie  Monster-in-law|`|iD4ejChZaa	you took his attention away from her-and now the baby gets and needs attention--so she feels she is pushed aside even further.    this lady needs to learn how to love, the baby 'cements' the fact that you and he are a family now, she'd rather not face it, help her ease into being a grandma, pretend you need her for something, ask her if she can cook something for your hubby for dinner because you are exhausted. this is a step in life she din't ask for--kind of sad in a way.     maybe she feels suddenly old now?|`|jVOapeKVaa	Personally I would be happy if my mother in law would never come to visit my newborn child. Want to trade?|`|1kfeghDDaa	The EXACT same thing that is wrong with mine! JEALOUSY!! Just continue your life with your husband. Who cares what she does. Let her have her relationship with her son and you can go about your business. You can never make her happy. I've never done anything to mine the 15 years that I've known her and she still treats me bad.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	she never let her son go ,, or she can;t ,,and she does bother with her grandbaby  ,,, welll she be one sorry woman before long ,,, god i be there as much as i could,,,
0fVtHNtmaa	I'm so sorry :(  Tell her your brother is hurting you and tell her she's hurting you that she is letting it happen. Ask her why she would let something like that happen. Tell her he's out of control.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	you cant really because now your mom well feel like ur tryin to tell her wat to do, most you can do is wait till he deos it imfront of ur mom other wise you cant tell your mom how to look after your bro. doesnt work like that.... she'll become really anger....|`|AA11545997	Do you have a Video Camera? If so, set it up so that you can record whats happening, then you can show them what is going on.  Also, if she's not making him go to school, if hes 5 then he should be in 1st grade. and it's against the law to keep your school age children home from school.  If she keep this up, she can get arrested. And your brother will be taken out of your home. (unless he's being Home schooled)
PO5Q7POuaa	Well I would just like to remind you that boyfriends aren't everything in the world. Sure they make a nice accessory sometimes but you can always live without them ;).  I personally would wait for the right guy because otherwise if you just date any ol' guy, you're kind of leading him on which isn't very fair for him.   I know it might seem hard to have to keep waiting and waiting and waiting, but I personally think that waiting is worth it. Why bother getting into a bad relationship that could hurt you more than ever when you could just wait a little while for the perfect one?  I'm waiting for my crush to realize that he secretly wants me too maybe this won't be for like another century but I'll wait if I have to =)  Hold in there!|`|m6P9BNWFaa	i think that as long as you don't DISLIKE these other guys that like you, then you should give one of them a chance. i've found in past experiences that everyone has something about them that could make you like them, it's just easier to see it in some people. so if you go out with one of these guys that likes you, then you might end up liking them after you get to know them. am i making sense? and obviously you're young since you go to school, and you can't just expect 'the one' to just magically appear. most people don't end up marrying their middle school or high school boyfriends, so you don't have anything to lose by going out with another guy.|`|6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	Try being single for a while until you get over the need to have a boyfriend.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	don't go out with anyone that you don't truly like... trust me been there done that and i always looked like the bad guy when i realized that i didn't like the person as much as i thought that i would..    you'll know when there is someone that you want to be with .. trust me i met my guy in 05 and we're still together ...before that i couldn't hold a relationship for more than 2 weeks!|`|DTN6Vg8caa	god ur still in school patience is the virtue of the mighty ok .  ur still very young u have lots of time u shd start worry only even ur 30 and without a guy in ur life rite now u dont have to u have loads of time|`|ghItgMZxaa	simple phrase  MANY MANY FISH IN THE SEA|`|a5a50191dfc01b41eb49850adcd033d5aa	well u shuld atleast try to get one as waiting for 1 may be for eternity and by the way u can have me as u'r boyfriend LOL|`|lOS08DBsaa	The same thing happened to me...&& I just had to learn patience, now I have the best boyfriend ever && waited for a long time. It was definitely worth it...don't get discouraged he will come when the time is right.
71VRvldJaa	This really isn't rocket science!  It means you look cute!    MKJ.....don't you think that's a pretty big assumption based on a compliment?  I just got back from a trip overseas and a 75 yr old male colleague told me I looked gorgeous with my tan.  Am I to assume from that he's interested in me?  NOT!  Why can't people just say thank you when they receive a compliment and leave it at that!  Why does there have to be some deep hidden meaning behind it?!?|`|4jx4wAhgaa	I think it probably means that the guy who said it to you, is trying to find a way to get you to be his girl! =D

NUWdgQuraa	You are obsessing.  Stop it.  While you're at it, stop having sex.  Look at yourself.  Your mind is a mess!  It's overloaded because, as lame as this might sound, you're too young to have sex.  There's a lot of hormones that happens during sex, and your brain is still developing.  You might mess something up permanently.    Also, the other girls are a distraction.  For some reason, you have some pain in your psyche that you want to avoid.  Remember, it's not your ex; it's you.    Take a time out, and fly solo for a while.  Hang with your friends.  Shoot hoops.  Ride a bike.  Go skateboarding.  Practice driving.  Do things kids are supposed to do.  Believe me, you'll want these years back.  Adulthood is full of complications that are a pain in the butt.  There's no need to rush into them.

And looking at your story, its interesting! seems genuinely loving but remember it, scientific signs are obsolutely correct but our human signs and indications are sometimes otherway round, so you need to do careful study and some observation. If you plan to move forward, don't take a quick decision if he really love you, his current signs toward you will not change and such thing will continue. If his intention is for short game, he will no more show you those signs....
sgRDJUXqaa	You're kicking him out, and you don't want him to hate you?  Hate to break it to you, but he will if you're going to toss him out on the street.    How about talking to him?  Tell him, "You've got x amount of time to clean up your act, and if there's no improvement, you're history."  He at least gets a heads up that he's being a tool, and you don't have to feel bad when you do get rid of him because he had a fair chance, fair warning -- and I think that's what people want when they're dumped.  They want advance notice that they're about to be history so they can clean up their act if they still want to be with you -- or save you the dirty work and just leave on their own accord if they don't.    EDIT: I'll leave that other stuff there in case it helps out someone else, but your situation is indeed different.  Again, though, he's going to hate you, there's no way around that.  Tell him, "I've been tolerant, but you continue to do things I don't approve of.  You have until the end of February to get out of my house."  Give him a month, that's fair, since he may have to find his own place.  If, at the end of the month he's not gone, wait until he leaves the house, change all the locks, pack up his stuff, and leave it on the porch.    I've actually had to kick out a guy before, and it wasn't pretty.  I ended up packing up all his stuff though because he could care less about what he thought were silly threats that I'd never go through with.  You have no legal right to keep his stuff and must return it to him, but there's no reason you can't change the locks (unless it's an apartment OR he's on the lease/mortgage) and get him ready to be gone.    I don't really think that anything is going to soften the blow, especially since you've tolerated his bad behavior for years.  That's your mistake, but I can't blame you for trying.  Just do it as swiftly and painlessly as possible.  A guy like that doesn't deserve class, but keep it for as long as he's still around.|`|oVHFz52Laa	You are doing a right thing. It would be better if you did not live with your boyfriend unless you are married, but since you are not married, this transition will be easier. Talk to him. Give him time to move out, but tell him honestly that you do not want to be in this relationship anymore.    Is it your own house or are you renting? Have your thought that maybe you get a new place and you move out. Looks like you have good reasons to end this relationship|`|SqNkiDmBaa	sit down with him and tell him what is bothering u and tell him that either he listens to what ur saying and stop or move out|`|AA11185865	He lives in your house yet he keeps breaking your rules after you warn him and give him more chances to improve?    It's like you are working for your boss but you keep messing-up not doing what he says. You know what eventually will happen.     His stay at your house was his to win or lose.  He has chosen to lose it.  I think the decision should take its course. How he reacts is his problem, not yours.    Who knows? This may become good medicine for him. It may teach him to listen and to respect the rules, boundaries, and feelings of others. If he keeps getting away with it, he won't learn this valuable lesson.     Right now it seems you are more concerned with his escalation of his temper and fear of possible violence than your tolerance of his breaking your rules. If this is the case, have people with you as you tell him that he has to leave, the deadline is Saturday (or whatever day is best), and that you mean it. Otherwise you and your friends will pack his stuff for him, put it at the front of the house, and he can come whenever he wants to and pick it up.  LOL    It's not going to be easy especially for someone who simply takes you for granted. But there is no easy way to do this.    And remember to change the lock on your door. He can keep the keys as a souvenir of what he lost when he did have the keys to your heart.  :)
acVPPTD2aa	Well it won't be good if you just asked him questions about himself. It would very obvious that you like him, and he won't be that interested unless he likes you.  I would suggest to find out something about him that he likes, and so do you. That way you can talk to him about that topic and eventually ask him other questions. Or the conversation could lead to something else, but if you are having trouble finding out something you both like. Then just start talking about something that he is obviously interested in such as a type of music, video games, or cars....? Who knows?  When hot chicks come up to me and ask me questions. I act awkward since I have no idea what to say. It's pretty lame and sad.  It wouldn't weird me out, I'll just feel uncomfortable.(that's me though.)  Don't worry he won't think of you as  creepy. You're the coolest, and good luck.|`|ztiA8n6jaa	If a girl came up to me and introduced herself that I did not know, depending on the setting Im almost positive I would think she was interested in me. It has happened to me and the above was true. Thats not a bad thing, but you never know the guy may not like you.
WxmNSxNGaa	Your boyfriend will not freak out about your mother passing away and you missing her. He will not be upset that the woman you call your mother is really your step-mother. If anything this will bring you closer together because you shared such a personal thing with him and make your relationship stronger.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	One night, turn off the TV, set up some music and soft lighting, make some dinner and actually have a conversation with your BF. You might find a good time to bring it up.    One point of advice though, it's really easy for you to feel emotional about what happened to your mom, but if you just blurt it out it will make your bf feel uncomfortable and not sure what to do. The best thing for this is to perhaps tell him some stories that you know about your mom, telling him in a light-hearted way is easier for him to take-in, and makes the whole conversation less uncomfortable.    Plus, I find it's always nicer to talk about the sad things in a lighter tone because it's easier to SAY something.|`|MFnbwV98aa	well im sure youll be able to tell him when your ready. if you truely love him you should be able to trust him with anything and its ok to cry in front of him hes there to comfort you. im sure he wont treat you different he will probobly respect the fact you can tell him your secrets im sorry about your mom. i would do that too :(|`|Q7wTZXWEaa	I guess I really don't understand why you would feel scared to reveal this 'secret'.    There is no shame in the fact that your birth Mother died.  As painful as it is, it's not like you caused her death.  For whatever reasons God had decided it was time to call her home.    Your b/f should also be able to see the beauty in your ability to love your step-mom at that level.      If you don't feel you can tell him outright, just figure out a way to slip it into the conversation.  Something like, I wonder if my birth mom would have like this dress (or) I wonder if my birth mom would think this is silly too.  Wait to see his response.  He may or may not want to engage you in further conversation about this.    If he doesn't want to talk about it, what else may he not want to discuss in the future?    Have you discussed this with your parents?  Maybe they will want to be there with you when you tell him.  Don't turn them away.  You will  want to present yourselves in the true family unit that you are.    As for all the idiots out there, they are just that - idiots.  Just remember that they are small people with small minds.  Who needs them?  You sound like a bigger person than that.    As for the need to cry, everyone does that.  Everyone has someone they miss terribly and mourn for at different times in their daily lives.  My best friend died 18 1/2 years ago and I still miss her.  I always will.  You will always miss your birth mother.  Your life-mother sounds as though she as stepped up to the plate and done all the right things.  I aplaud both of you for being able to develop your relationship.    Please just remember that this is nothing to be shamed of.  Hold your head up high and walk with the strength of both of your Mother's. They will both be very proud of you.        Good Luck to you honey
8810c184d3e29a1c56d7820b3ed3f27faa	To be honest with you, I have gone through something very similar with my EX-gf.    I gave her my first kiss, my first love, my virginity.. she was my first love. First everything. I was her third, although she was a virgin before she met me.     I am not able to get over anything she did because i want my gf/wife to be really pure and unhindered. Ever since i found out about her past, i lost respect in her. Unfortunately, that respect will never come back.     If you don't think that you will recover soon, then your only options are to either live with the pain or leave her.    Just wait a few weeks and see how you feel.  Good luck bro.|`|wE2etBzbaa	I can help you, by adding to her number, to increase the gap. .1 for you, 70 for her.   like basket ball with a bad team    but seriously it is not matter only matter diseases, but if you already did, you might already get that, but you can check with a doctor, otherwise it is ok as long as she keep staying with you only.|`|oEUjPGsUaa	i think its wrong that she didnt tell you in the first place    lol you shouldve asked her before you got into a relationship with her  it would bother me too to be honest with you but they way you handle  things in your relationship should be what YOU think you should do  everyone handles things differently..  if you think its always gonna bother you then just forget it  cause thats something you cant change
a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	It really depends on what you are afraid she is using you for. If it is something like money, security, etc then you should be able to tell by her general enthusiasm over other issues.     If it is to cure loneliness, then you would probably be able to spot it by how she responds to you. If you can say things and she says nothing in turn... she is using you.     If she likes you, she will be excited to respond to most anything you have to say, maybe even cutting you off in the process. She will also make an effort to not step on your toes too much but try to hang out with you as much as possible.
jmqT5p0Baa	First of all... CALM DOWN :) .. she is a mother and I would be pissed too if someone had my daughter skipping school.. it makes you look like a bad influence on her... If I was you I would get in contact with her mother and sincerely apologize and tell her that you made a big mistake and you realize how dumb your actions were and you are sorry that yall skipped and it will never happen again and she has your word, tell her that you are sorry that you disappointed her and that really isnt the kind of person that you are and you made a mistake! If I was her mother thats what I would want from you.. to know that your truly sorry and you are a teenager and teens make mistakes and you learn from them!|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Let things settle down before making any decisions you'll regret later. Trust is an interesting concept, and it's hard to get back, but I'm sure, through time, things will work out.    Just keep being honest. Don't lose any more trust.|`|QADhk0nFaa	stuff will get better, my mom used to treaten my old boyfriend that she was ganna cut his dick off with a spoon also she tried paying people to pretend to like him to keep him aways from me she transfered schools on me and also got a restraining order on him and WE STILL FOUND AWAY! dont give up hope okay:? !! yours is not that bad and i did okay! you can do it|`|5XzeOF9Iaa	wow. . . um i'm really sorry. . . just keep seeing each other anyway!  if u guys love each other u shldn't be kept apart. . . and don't listen to them.  nothing should be able to keep u 2 apart|`|7FAZYMy3aa	Ok I don't think you should kill yourself, and I really think you're "baby's" mom is WAY to strict, all you did was skip one day of school.|`|ae9db1fc2f90ba344bdcf7d6f5201771aa	OK well don't kill yourself and then you need to grow up and make yourself into a better man then you are now so that if this should ever happen again you won't have to lie....be a man... tell the truth!
iXTsCDWRaa	Hey, I'm in the same boat as you are. Except with me and my friend we're 18. Still in high school and everything. I have told her I liked her and its gotten awkward. I've been friends with her for quit some time now. 8 years about. I've been asking myself do I really love her enough to let her make her own decisions. She just needs time away from me.  I would say you tell her. You never know things might work out for you. Plus I am sure at your age you and your friend wouldn't think as i do. You should be able to talk it out in a civilized manner. Tell her and see how it unfolds. Its only going to hurt you in the long run to see them dating.|`|nHC6hV7Haa	wait to till she is single and at least go to the movies or something and talk to her like this"i have been felling this weird connection between us and   i like you."if she is shocked and doesn't agree then quickly pull back and say only as a friend as if your playing around.|`|mA3ZAKVfaa	You typed us a message on what to do, you already gave us the answer. tell your friend what you just typed to us. in the old saying: the Truth will set you free.

tU5NJVL3aa	He told you why -- he wants it to be a private thing, and if you were to ignore that, it would upset him.  What is it that you don't understand?
29yMjFInaa	I think every girl goes through a time in their life when they date the guys that they are attracted to, rather than those that are best for them. Personally, I dated 3 guys that we're not exactly "winners". After a while I got tired of those type of bad-boys and I am now dating the most amazing man! He is in medical school and has a great future ahead of him! So I will agree with you on this issue, but know that eventually we all grow out of it! Nice guys do finish last, but that's because they end up with the girl!|`|8U23iLKVaa	not all beautiful girls date the wrong guys...  example.... (ME!) :D  haha i'm joking. but i mean some of us are out there still waiting for one of the "good" guys to come around. and some of us, for some reason have low selfesteem and think ya know we cant do better or we dont deserve better.. so we date the loser dumb guy who treats us like crap. only because hes cute. idk but not all of us go for the bad guys.    theres still hope out there :).  hope i helped.. goodluck.|`|rRC7GZRKaa	Yes girls hate nice guys.|`|U22nd6Aaaa	I read a very good article about why women usually end up with jerks or losers instead of the nice faithful guy. Check my source. I found it a good read and now I try not to make the same mistakes|`|b6e8a23e8ce0872697abf94a37d4524caa	So many beautiful girls are a real pain to be in a relationship anyway.  Some are beautiful because they are shallow and so focused on their own beauty (they work really hard at it).  These types often care far more about appearances and what you give them than about you.  Other beautiful women are a pain because so many guys will flatter them and tell them they're great even if they're not - because the guys secretly want to sleep with them.  Often these girls are really good about appearing really sweet and nice - until you get to know them.    Sooooo.... keep in mind that just because someone is beautiful doesn't mean they are a worthwhile girlfriend.|`|ODGWM7vUaa	Some really great girls end up with losers because of bad luck. They have the opportunity leave them. They, however, don't because of their  own insecurity.   What can we do? Simple treat the girls in your life with kindness and respect.   having a  good heart eventually is rewarding.    Later.|`|6p50zivoaa	well i personally think that girls who r with those kind of guys just wana look kewl being with the guy but they know deep down that those guys arent gonna stay with them or that those guys arent the right guys.alota girls dont like nice guys they arent wild or crazy but i think nice guys r better.i dont care about bad boys much...|`|RiHiOCANaa	No its not just you|`|QBGszg3waa	no everyone is at the same intellectual level, and a lot of women i noticed just make bad judgements, look> brains seems to me.|`|np5R16RSaa	oh my god,  i think im one of those girls. man i dont know y but its my luck i guess or is it coz i get attracted to assholes? my bf is a real mean person and treats me like **** and i just take it in but i swear if you see me your gana yell at me and say what the hell you can do waaaaaaaaaaaay better.  maybe its coz the sweet guys barely ask me out!? its the players (usually hot looking ones or with very high self confidence) who tend to ask me out! maybe the sweet and kind ones just are nervous around me.   but its not fair ! :(
n195n9Avaa	Yes it did hurt, but no I didn't want to stop.    It all depends on how well lubricated/aroused you are, how small you are down there, and the size of the guy.|`|f1i6DPHFaa	For me it hurt for a moment, but not the entire time. If you use tampons or masturbate the pain is lessened because you are already stretching the walls of your vagina. Most of my friends have said it was relatively painless as well.  Just make sure that you are ready to have sex in the first place. Also, make sure that you are properly lubricated and are not being pressured by your partner.|`|wZAjrAqhaa	ya it hurts a little bit    i suggest waiting and please dear god please wear a condom, theres so many stds out there.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Yeah Baby it's going to hurt!|`|Afmv2WYSaa	It hurt a little bit but i didnt bleed or anything. I definitely didnt want to stop. it was bitter sweet.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	yea it hurts but its kinda a good pain but may cause to wanna stop|`|IN1X1CVGaa	ive heard for some girls it doesnt hurt  tho with me it did  and i actually cried  but after that it was amazing    its definitely not something you should be really scared of  cause it wont hurt forever  and you have to deal with it sometime  just be very lubricated and have him go slow and be gentle  and im sure after a little while it will be great! :D|`|DuGanGcNaa	It will hurt and it might bleed (sorry, just being honest here).|`|r1hURLPAaa	just chill..i have exp with many girls..intially it pain a lot to them but after 2-3 minutes rthey enoyed it like in heaven|`|lwFA0EL6aa	like..uh..you..like...don't ask ..a...uhh..question...likes..unless we all..uhh..like..already..know what your talking about..uhh..somehow.|`|wS1JDr3Zaa	umm my girlfriend said it hurt but she kept going as pain was overthrown and turned into pleasure|`|K62ll0Zxaa	yes honey it hurts like crazy esp. if ur man is big(down there)|`|D8u5mBTNaa	i'm not gonna lie to you. it does in fact hurt. like when i lost my virginity it felt like someone was literally trying to tear my cooch apart. it hurt tons. but then as he started to stick it in and out it kind of didnt hurt as much as it did at the beginning. but now i got used to it and i love it!|`|P38ULZbraa	If you're thinking of having sex, don't - unless you are in love. Trust me it's not worth it. I made that mistake when I was 14, just before freshman year. Sex is a lot better when you are in love. It's more of a connection. You don't have sex just because it feels good, but because you love that person, that's why it's called "making love". To answer your question, it's different for every girl/woman. My first time I thought it would hurt, but it didn't. I really hope that you wait until you are in love to have sex. Good luck [:|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	stick something up there and find out for yourself!|`|4NKoOPIMaa	don't let others tell you different but it hurts at first. now on movies they exaggerate a little bit but its somewhat true. just make sure your relaxed and not tensed cause it'll really hurt. you might be nervous at first cause i was. only do it if your ready cause if not your in for some pain.|`|EGIZMgI6aa	NO, IT SHOULDN'T HURT AT ALL, I SHOULD FEL REALLY GOOD, SOMETIMES WHEN GIRLS DO IT FOR THEIR FIRST TIME THEY GET NO FEELING FROM IT, IT WON'T HURT UNLESS THERE IS A LOT OF THRUSTING, GOOD LUCK!|`|MOytYgPCaa	yes it does..............im not a girl nor have i tried it but i got sum dirty Friends and my Friends look this stuff up fur out stupid Fends|`|OwUnmjgGaa	I dont think there is any way to actually know if it will hurt.

To be real about the whole thing, most wives with husbands in jail spend alot more time trying to see them while they are in jail so either you two had issues before he went to jail or he is in jail because of something that happened between you two and caused him to be in jail, either way the fact he is in jail and you don't miss him as much as should be, is a sign, so take the step and do each of yourselfs a favor and move on.|`|ZPg4tdrraa	You say you have not been thinking of him much...how much is much...and when you do think of him...what do you think...do you remember times when you held each other and loved each other....the body and mind are very resourceful..maybe its a way to help you get by...being without him around....but if you think of him at all...there must be something there...i would visit him or write him...see if you can find that magic you once had with him...but if he is in prison for doing something to you than you should walk no matter what...those things will be between you forever...|`|Ddb5821Jaa	Love has no boundaries. so yes, I think you do love him.

Meaning, he's not showing a whole lot of character, stability and achievment/success. I would feel upset that he did something to put himself in the position to be incarcerated. Some people may really only go to jail once and "learn their lesson" but the majority of incarcerated people do things that are harmful, illegal or irresponsible again and again and again. So ask yourself- do you want to live with that sort of life? I was dating a man who had been to jail before and I didn't  think it was too big of a deal (plus, we were just dating) and I started to feel serious about him but SURPRISE! He went to jail AGAIN. He had bad habits and didn't do much for himself and his jail history put him in a bad position for success. So we did not get back together. Years later I caught up with him, recently actually, and he had gone to jail one or two more times and had a "convicted felon" card he has to carry around. He doesn't have his own place, he doesn't have a job, he has 2 kids that he barely sees/barely fathers and in 10 years that is pretty much all he has done...|`|jROpVbrhaa	You dont love him now.if someone loves somebody we keep imagining them , thinking them, so if your not worried about him, then move on.Get a better life.|`|I9ILP8iRaa	run girl...... i stayed, now i wish i did not.|`|QVsxjEo5aa	First why is he in jail? If its for something that he keeps doing then you're probably tired of it. Only you know|`|mCq2Sd7Paa	Will I would think that if I was in Jail the my wifes feeling of missing me would get worse. Now it depends  how long he has been away. If it less than a year you might have fallen out of love. Go talk to him and see if it reminds you of why you married him in the first place.
ZO3Vd6dpaa	It really depends on your S.O's relationship with his family, and also the status of your relationship with him.  If you intend to spend the rest of your life with him, you will have to deal with the in-laws.  If your S.O can see the faults in his family, and understand why you have issues, then it's something that can tactfully be brought up.  But if your S.O is super attached to his family, his mother can do wrong, his father is the greatest role model ever, etc then you will probably open Pandora's Box and it will create an issue that you will have to tackle over and over again.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Not if you want to keep him, no.    EDIT: That's just my philosophy. Blood is blood. Most people understand when their families are difficult. But why do you have to say anything about it? Do you see them very often? If I have a family member who's rotten I'm the only one who gets to say it.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	i would say some think. but i would be nice about it.|`|hh892gJfaa	What are you classing as "reasonable reasons"?    It really depends. And I would never say it outright - "Y'know, I really hate your family..." That would just be rude.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	I absolutely would tell him and I have.

HOQp0gA7aa	What you could say is, "Hello, I'm that creepy obsessive stalker you met that wants to molest you, but I'm afraid of getting beat up by your boyfriend."  However, I don't recommend that as a positive way to start a conversation.    What you should do is not make a big deal about how you got her contact information.  You also shouldn't send her an e-mail out of the blue.  You should get a myspace account, and send her a friend link.  If she links you back, then you know you can occasionally post polite non-personal messages on her board.      In the big picture you should give up on trying to involve yourself in a romantic relationship with this girl.  There is nothing favoring your current scenario in terms of getting a relationship off the ground.  She has a boyfriend already, she lives too far away for you to visit, and she hasn't voluntarily given you her contact information.  You spoke to her a bit while she was bored and out on a camping trip.  It's time to face it, you were just a convenient diversion during her temporary isolation from her boyfriend.      This isn't what you want to hear to justify your desires, but it is the advice you need to heed if you want to avoid making an jackass out of yourself.  It's time to start talking to some other available local girls, and let this one go.      If you find this advice hard to accept, then put yourself into her boyfriend's shoes for a moment.  If you were her boyfriend, how would you feel if a bunch of creepy stalkers were chasing after her like a pack of panting dogs?  What if she dumped you in favor of one of these jackasses?  Does putting it in those terms actually make you feel better about your pursuing her?  It all comes down to just how much of a selfish bastard you are willing to be.      I hope this helps.|`|AA11441704	No, this is not........not anyway near .........tell her I got your address from this........and continue|`|eKVnsobDaa	Honestly? This is wrong in a few ways. Just don't. Find someone closer to you. She has a boyfriend.     If you want to talk to her just as a friend, friend her on myspace. Don't email her sketchily without friending her. It's rude and yes, a little stalkerish.|`|U22nd6Aaaa	Maybe friend her on myspace if you think you can just be her friend but honestly it's best to give up before you start. She lives far away and she has a boyfriend. It wont work because of the distance and it's unethical to try while she has a boyfriend.|`|tzNqAWhdaa	No that is not really stalking tell her you checked her out on myspace because you wanted to see what she liked and that if she had a boyfriend just let her know that you really like her. STALKING is when you follow someone where ever and peek in there windows to watch their every move, so unless you did that then I don't consider you a stalker.
FM2YIhcuaa	I think the best thing to do is to forget about him and move on, girl! He is not worth your time anymore!|`|E0gcH9Jsaa	after all he DID manipulate ME and another girl for a year .>???????      when he goes to jail get you another man:)|`|cRJgZMV1aa	No, actually not crude enough.|`|ovMjLwL6aa	You tell him sister!|`|ZPYCus4xaa	MOVE ON.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	I wouldn't say it was out of line because you say mean things when your hurt, we all do ...  but in my opinion he isn't worth the time   by you doing this he knows that he got the best of you and he's really not worht the time...|`|H4UxIqe2aa	are you 12? if i was him i wouldn't even take that to heart. surely you could have come up with something better?|`|DFoBVHw8aa	nope... he was in for it|`|d1O0xUjNaa	That was kinda crude.  I mean you don't have to stoop to his level. That just makes you just like him.|`|Ne9ovJRTaa	this is dumb. dont waste your time on such immature stuff. honesty is always key so if you just simply made a statement about something you are planning on doing, why is that crude? people should say whats on their mind.|`|rOeUOFZOaa	Why in the hell are you going out with a jailbird to began with?  Find yourself a good man that'll take care of, love and cherish you always....    Find yourself a good military man. It's a profession completely built on honor and integrity|`|biiAAZqtaa	As long as you wrong someone you're justifying another wrong on you. He shouldn't have played you but maybe you shouldn't bother with him anymore either. Just apologize for it and let him go. You seem pretty intelligent, don't waste your time with someone inconsiderate and in and out of jail.|`|D8u5mBTNaa	he deserved it cause all he did was do you wrong. dont take his bull s***|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Honestly? I think its childish & immature that either of you stooped to that level, but idk how old you are. I think its kinda screwed up saying you would party when he goes to jail. & if you let him manipulate you for a year, you should have kicked his butt to the curb a looooong time ago.|`|BeAVEk2yaa	No, girl.  He deserved worse.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	More childish on both your parts than crude.|`|UldvbAIWaa	no ur good|`|bkgBLjuvaa	no it wasn't but two wrongs don't make a right.. ignore all of it and him..|`|71VRvldJaa	I think all of this is irrelevant!  He's your ex and he's in your past and you shouldn't be sending messages to each other any more.  Why put any more emotional investment into him.  Delete him from your contact list and move on....quit playing these stupid games!|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Why lower yourself to his standards?  Like you said, you're immature, so cut it out and move on -- away from him and all the bad memories.  It's the only way you'll heal.|`|K7jjvnjpaa	no. stupid manipulative bastards belong in jail, and Id celebrate it too.|`|RppnD2Fuaa	Not at all. He cheated you. That man must deserved it. Good Job. personally i hate a guy who cheats.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	no- you were upset! unless you plan on having a long-lasting friendship with him, you're fine.|`|CU1WRghVaa	No is not crude at all actually you are being too much on him.|`|AA11922229	Birds of a feather flock together. But you love him so much you'll take anything, even abuse. Too bad you haven't experienced "Love" from a man. When you finally find a man who brings you flowers and acts like a man, you'll ask yourself. "Where has my mind been?"|`|qHCtBq07aa	Nah, it wasn't too crude. He deserved it after a party isn't that bad.|`|afkygHMgaa	If you are more worried about some childish bickering back and forth on a website more than the fact that you were dating a jailed, loser, player.....you are in for a very hard life|`|s7UZZbVhaa	good job. he deserved it.|`|BRo2gNkqaa	no, the truth hurts..let him have it for what he did. wasted your life for a year

4v8kXmmcaa	All dating is, is when two people agree to spend time with each other, so they can get to know each other better, show and share their feelings, and grow closer over time. It don't matter what you do, or when you do it, just spend the time with the person, get to know them, and show them the real you. Thats how I see it anyway.  If you both agree to that, then yeah its dating. I hope this helps. Why not ask this person about it?|`|7iIMHrObaa	BESHRAM TIME PASS KAR RHA HAI KYA TU \  AAPNE ME SABSE PEHLE UNDERSTANDING BANAO   FIR GHUMNE JANA   JAB DEKHO DATE   TIME PASS KAR RHA HAI KYA|`|bZTJYsoLaa	When two of you go out together to get to know each other better is Dating. Whatever you two do does not matter. From simple chat to having sex.
r1IWKjFxaa	Just ask him to casually hang out for a while... not quite yet cause he might still be hoping for her to call him and tell him he made a mistake, but keep talking to him.  In about a week ask if he'd like to get lunch or go bowling or something.
fIeLH6HPaa	I was in a relationship for 16 yrs, no Im not still with the person. However I did learn some areas that I could improve on.For instance, demand that the other person show you respect, listen, hear what each other is saying, communicate,communicate,communicate.|`|ziiYVYXZaa	I am 18 years old and am still looking for the right one.|`|cl1pJK38aa	My first boyfriend in high school and I were together two years, but I have no idea how we made it that long... we had absolutely nothing in common.  My second longest relationship was a year and a half, but we broke up because he had zero respect for me.  My current boyfriend and I have been together for two months, but he's the one I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.  So, it's not yet... but my current relationship will be my longest.|`|uz0R5pjHaa	Um... I've been in one for about 5 months and i think it's gonna keep until graduation :D (10th grade now)    best answer :D|`|YJjcqoUKaa	my longest relationship and the only long term one lasted 2yrs and 8months  i dated him from when i was 14 until almost 17  and we have a baby together.
1EHW0vbaaa	Go speak to her in a private place where its just the wo of you alone.  When she starts to stress and get out of hand then just grab her by the head and kiss her...then rip off her clothes and F**K her brains out right there.And while your doing it tell her to stop acting like a b*tch.  Shes the type of girl that likes a guy that takes charge.You should be the tough guy.When she yells tell her to shut the f**k up. You should be the hard a**. Then you will see she will turn into putty.  Trust me.  Goodluck|`|0NkrNStxaa	try setting her up with another guy lol  or just try to totally ignore her.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	restraining order.|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Get admission to a far of college or relocate and get a good job!  If none of this works... Rent a Tank or BazoooKA, you know the rest and be trigger happy and blow(her) up.|`|gapWTVmDaa	I hope you'll learn from that.   If communication is still possible, tell her that in simple terms. Threatening is a sign of desperation.  If she is angry person due to some mental thing, you must be careful and perhaps talk about this with her parents.  If she is angry because she is possessive and can't afford to loose you, tell her that she will be better with someone else.   I would also recommend not to talk about this during her PMS era cause it is extra hard for them at that time.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	You want her to stop but don't want to get the police involved.  You need a restraining order, but before that tell your ex that if she keeps doing this, she will go to prison. Mentally unstable or not, she knows what a prison is like and probably want to avoid going to court.|`|8gWqRvJXaa	shes obviously not mentally stable, so talking to her wont work, because she wont listen... the only way you can fix this is by calling the police, or getting a restraining order...|`|6Wz01oZ4aa	You might try a restraining order or something like that. Or hell if you want to play dirty. Embarass the hell out of her somewhere. Like take her out and break up with the in the most brutal way you can think of. You may look like an ***, but as long as you are scared of her, she has you! Stand up to her. One way or the other!!|`|W2Qegyrqaa	cut all communication. everytime you talk to her you are giving her crazy a** a little more hope|`|lU8ucOpjaa	restraining order.  it may seem harsh but that is all you can do.  i have dealt with people like this before  trust me- get a restraining order and block her from contacting you in every way possible.      from experience- she probably wont beat up another girl you date she is saying that to try and keep you with her.    get a restraining order, you don't have to put up with that crap.|`|UgEYBvh8aa	Alright here's what you do.    And for heaven's sake, do NOT try to back out of it.    Go to her, and bluntly tell her what you've just told us and how frustrated you are. Tell her that you are completely unattracted to her and furthermore, you detest her. If she still doesn't get it, then try to reason with her and point out that she needs to let go because there's no point holding onto a guy who doesn't even like her. Don't TALK to her. YELL at her. I know that sounds mean- but an eye for an eye. She yelled at you, and treated you like crap. This is your turn to lash it back at her. And you may feel guilty, but it's all for the best. It will hurt her, but she will let go and will eventually get over it. Eventually.    Meanwhile, don't take her calls or messages. After you lay it on her, back off and give her some space. And make sure you get in the last word.    Good luck.|`|5r91BIszaa	my bf had a similar problem with an ex..change your phone number for sure and be VERY careful who you give the new number to. my bf is on the verge of having to get a restraining order (and hes changed his number twice and weve been together for about 2 years or so) but you seem past the point of being on the verge and need one asap lol tell the cops or other people about her threats so that if anything did happen or if she started telling lies, you and everyone would know why. hope it gets better for you!|`|umGi6gTcaa	record her going crazy when you tell her you don't want to be her bf then head straight to the cops. From my personal experience the only way to get rid of the crazies is a restraining order or moving far far away.    You don't still sleep with her or anything right? Cut off all communication with her and seriously call the cops.|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	Mart...you're a brave man to have stood through that sht for a year.    Solution is simple: restraining order.    She seems out of control man...I think you shouldn't talk to her anymore..that has failed.    Tell her straight forward. "It's OVER!!!!!...I MOVED ON. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!"  if she keeps going, then tell her you're going out with a girl named Melissa (made up name) from school.    If she threatens you...then you gotta go and get the police involved or she might hurt you.|`|jeblH6F5aa	Buy a bullet....rent a gun.|`|iJx16YqRaa	Ok, Ok, just send her over, I'll take care of it.
gFAA2PtXaa	ask 4 her  . all she can do is say no not yet! lol well good luck!!!       i hope that helps.     xoxo
jqhvxWzGaa	that's awesome! a wedding is a celebration, and having the most important people in your life in the most important roles is perfect. those are pretty unusual roles for kids, and i totally love it!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i think it's great!  and if you wanted to include uncle george's pet orangutan that would be fine, too.  it's your day, do it your way and have in it anyone you want.|`|UspK4SQBaa	You can have whomever you like in your wedding party.    Congratulations.|`|tBODwcqXaa	I think it's a beautiful way to celebrate the day. It is really a union of your families. Great idea :)|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	The one thing you have to do is let your photographer know the relationships.     As a wedding photographer I see a lot of family in the wedding. If your kids are ok with the roles you have lined up for them, then it is fine.|`|mF3PsJUVaa	i think if one has children i thinks its a great idea they are in the wedding. My fiance and i have a 1 1/2 yr old and she will be 2 when we get married and she will be our flower girl.|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	Sure! You can have any one you want in your wedding party..... after all it is YOUR party!|`|MztgUa0raa	Of course!  It will add immensely to the beauty of the day, and help unite the family.  Celebrate the day together... it sounds like a beautiful idea.  Also, I do not know of any cultural issues that apply here.|`|mTKD9GQvaa	i think that lovely, why not have your closest family take part in something that will make you a new family!! your so lucky theyr willing! good luck!
AA10764658	Because he cheated on me.|`|AA11441704	B/c he couldn't decide........|`|vzOIw72raa	yea i broke up with my boyfriend because he was more into making money than into me.   but i tryed to work it out plenty of times and talked to him and he didnt care. you should talk to him then decide if yall should move on. or not.|`|39jizNE2aa	Hm. If you love the person you're with try and see the best in it, if you're feeling like you want out or need space or something you need too sit down and speak with him about it; telling him how you feel. But just not seeing it work out in the end wouldn't be a good excuse for breaking up with someone.|`|p3JGYWrBaa	Im sure many people done that also. It just the consequences. Some times you choose not to listen to your heart.|`|JFHV9aXZaa	Yes i have felt this way a lot of times but depends on how long you knew each other if you only know each other for like a 1 week than it just means a change and doubting your self give it some time. On the other hand he might not be your true love remember there is lots of fish in the sea but its not my life to control you do what you feel is right if you don't know just talk to him maybe you can fix it hoped i helped you.
XDz1SIOwaa	Just give her time( a month or so) sounds like you guys like each other it just gets complicated when a child is in the mix, just keep hanging out with her as friends ask her what she wants to do and where she wants to go.  If you do that she will know you are thinking about what she wants. Also if things do go farther ask before you kiss her it shows her you respect her feelings    Hope this helps!!!|`|K7jjvnjpaa	either you have to be painfully super patient, or move on. you don't need that kind of mental unstable behavior on top of the fact that she is a woman.
sFdn9hIkaa	well if she's not your girlfriend you shouldn't feel obligated to do so - but if you really like this girl and she likes you then you might as well make her your girlfriend.     if you don't know whether or not you really like her, just wait it out and get to know her better first. it's always better to wait and get to know someone properly before you make them your "boyfriend/girlfriend", to avoid breakups over stupid things later on.
eKVnsobDaa	Key words. Past relationships.    Girls have liked you enough to have a relationship with you. Think about that. They chose you over everyone else. That might fix your self-esteem issues.|`|tsdHndRhaa	read your bible or get some counseling please.|`|pO0MBHo9aa	dude come down just be cool do what you like to do best for a few hours i like video games then think about the x girl for 30 minutes every good time any thing if you need to cry cry its best then think about the new girl for one hour think about how you will be with her and what thing you will go do with each other think happy thoughts ok and then do what you like the most for 2 hours then sleep on it think about the new girl in the morrning and this should work it really worked for me also for better results after you wake up and think about the new girl for a while go do somthing with her maby a movie and a place like starbuks or jumba juice asker where she wants to go well this worked really well for me and also good luck kk.
MQw5crl6aa	If you have to ask you probably are one.
UgEYBvh8aa	Well. You are seriously focusing way too much on your looks. You made cultural references several times in your description, which is an indicator that there is a little problem there. I'm not sure what, but I'm just pointing that out now.    From personal experience, if you simply just stop looking [and I know this sounds stupid, but it takes time] for a boyfriend or more guys to flirt with [and by this, I mean TRULY stop looking, not just pretending] then they will come to you. It has happened to me so many times, that I believe it to be true. You just have to be patient and accept yourself for who you are. The guys will come along soon enough.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	I'll be your b/f...   :)|`|rEafx4QTaa	i may be able to help. do u live in new york state?lol
kIblsxJQaa	Sounds like he is giving you a taste of your own medicine.  Dont start any conversation with him and he will soon come to you.|`|1bab727d1cd596988cb69592228ec78caa	the best way to win him back, if that's what you're trying to do, is value yourself and tell him you are moving on with your life.  show him you can live without him and if there is anything real going on he will pursue you.  If you act all clingy and needy it can be a huge turn off even if you continue being "friends".    Your version of friends and his version of friends are probably different, if he is a typical guy he wants to be friends just to say its cool between the two of you and nothing more.  Don't take it personally...|`|KfeeV5nraa	he is ur ex ur not suposto lik him|`|wE2etBzbaa	because he is an ex.    it is hard to be friends after Dick and Bush met. then things collapsed.|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	He is trying to move on and it sounds like your still not over him.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	nothing personal, but after reading this, I think I understand why he's ignoring you.|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	If he is ignoring you then ignore him too.|`|j7OfrcD0aa	HES IGNORING YOU BECAUSE YOU DUMPED HIM, ISAAC NEWTON.|`|Ci3Efibkaa	i didn't read that long paragraph, but i'd think an EX boyfriend would tend to ignore you|`|EHCM324Faa	He your ex you shouldn't be still likin' him or tryin' to talk to him you should just let it go|`|neJbYkJoaa	Sounds like both of you are confused about what you want.  Instead of texting and emailing him, maybe pick up the phone and have a personal conversation and maybe just tell him that you still care for him, and that it is hard to just be friends, but you still enjoy his friendship.      I think if you get things more out in the open and tell him that you would like him to call you once in a while and have it two ways back and forth, he will lighten up.  Just let him know that you still want to hear from him.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	I've had something similar going on for a long time with my ex.     Try to just ignore him back for a while. Maybe he's having a hard time knowing what to say to you, now that you're not a couple? I know it's hard to not talk to him, but it's what works best. If he *really* wants to be friends, he'll realize how much he misses you when you're not available to talk. Even better if when he tries to talk to you, you pretend you're busy and tell him you'll talk to him later.     I know that sounds like the old-fashioned "hard to get" kind of thing, but it's better for your psyche, too.|`|AA12376468	I think he is becoming less available to you so it could be time to move on.  There are sooo many young men out there in the world who would appreciate your attention.   Life is too short to live it unhappily.|`|R4MXqBHhaa	Some times being friends is hard. You still might want to be with them but know it's not for the best. .....but for most guys were simply jerks.    From personal experience I've broken up with chicks and would be perfectly fine with never talking to them again because things didn't work out (which is why we broke up).  However if I'm not rebounding as quickly as I wished, I find myself "becoming friends" with them, although we only talk when I'm 1/2 drunk or finding myself alone.    Take it from me kid, boys only want 1 thing and friendship isn't it.|`|UEDUvVxaaa	You sound like it's your way or the highway.  He is a free individual and if he wants to be left alone then give him time.
GpbwKmViaa	Meet with her, and make sure she understands that you told her about the 3 kisses so that she knows herself and doesn't have to find out herself. Also make sure she knows why you told her and if you really want her back, tell her what you want. Don't be demanding though, it just might upset her more. You don't seem like a player because you actually took the time to ask this question, so I'm sure you like her. Keep on trying, unless she likes somebody else and is using that event to use as an excuse to break up with you.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	You both need to learn how to trust one another.  This is why long distance relationships are hard.  In a way, she is overreacting because like you said, you were doing it as a park of a game and it was only on the CHEEK, which doesn't really qualify as cheating.    It's hard to earn back trust over long distance - so I'm not really sure if any of the "known" strategies would work.  You could always send her flower and a teddy bear apologizing for your mistake and see how she takes it.  Other than that, you just have to reassure her she's the only one for you, by telling her everyday (in a different way) that she's beautiful, that you love her, and whatever else it is you like about her (or how you appreciate her).|`|RGGcWvawaa	send her a flower bouquet or thing she likes...a card etc
6J8sHGRIaa	Hmmmm.... first off... i think we all know what crush means.. its an admiration towards someone... either a celebrity, a player, or even your classmate or schoolmate! It's either you like him 'cause he/she is smart, he or she is good at something... or just like everyone else.. 'cause of his/her cuteness!    i know we all want our crushes to like us just the way we are, right? and to notice us or at least to know that we exist in this chaotic world! or even know our first name...    and we kept glancing at him or her every time we have a chance... but has he or she ever caught you looking? *smiles* wooohoooo!    and when you see him or her.. you blush and do that "guppy effect" (it means you tingle! haha)    okay these are the ways.. i've gathered it up! and i think it really helps! only if your crush is at the campus... haha...    1. Have eye contact! but! don't make it too obvious.. :D    When you pass by him or her... try to look in his/her eyes.. notice how amazing they are... :D but then quickly look away!    2. Call his/her name!    Everyone reacts when someone calls his or her name... but one thing that will make him/her notice you without intentionally calling him/her is that... when you see a person you know (with the same name as your crush) and your crush at the same place.. you shout his/her name! Then both your friend and your crush will look but then your crush notice that you approach your friend who has the same name.. (believe me! this works every time!) :D    3. Smile at him... *smiles*    This is the simplest and most effective of all! Just simply smile at him/her and you'll never know your crush will smile back!    *smiles*    *smiles back*    *faints*    NOTE: but make sure you smile at him at the right time so that he/she won't think that you've gone mad by looking at him in a long period of time....    4. Know his or her great buds!    Just be friendly with them... You'll have lots of friend to be with in time of need... Just talk about everything naturally... Except the part of your crush! And you get to talk to him/her too!! and the bonus is that.. you get to see your crush in their environment when they are all oh-so-comfortable!    5. Dress nicely... :D    Choose clothes that fits your personality so that he will be able to know what kind of person you are... You gotta stand out in the crowd! And the hair.. you can experiment what style you would like! Be creative!    I don't know if you feel this way too but does your crush stands out in the crowd? Like, you really know if he's there or something? Oh well! it does to us! :D haha!    6. Join contests at your school where you can display your talent!    Join some contests that you will be able to win! Like declamation, Art contests, dance contests or even quiz bees! And your crush will be like "Woah! She/he is good at this! Cool!" Show them what you're good at!    7. Talk a lot!    It really pays off being a talkative person! Talkative = lots of people will listen! And you gotta be funny too! And the best thing that can happen is seeing your crush listening and laughing! And that makes your heart jumps, ain't that right?    8. Earn a nickname that everyone knows!    Earn a nickname.. a positive nickname! Like "Miss/Mister Linguistic" and it does pay off knowing different language! :D or even "Einstein"... or simply just your nickname.... you never know he might start calling you with that nickname!    9. Know what your crush likes!    Know what his/her hobbies... whatever he/she likes to do.. you gotta show interest! I guess we all know that if you have a crush, you look for something you have in common! Even though its senseless! Like, you have the same favorite color..stuffs like that.... But things begins with these stuffs! :D Kinda true ya' know!    10. And last! Just be yourself when you are around him/her!    Don't try be someone you're not.. 'cause that's just like living a lie! And believe me..that's horrible at the end! Just act natural! Try not to blush! And forget that you will just blabber in front of him! He might even think it's funny! :D                So what are you waiting for? Go and let your crush notice you!
kjOsSmM0aa	As long as the father is reliable with the kids, then he should be offered the first opportunity. Then, it should probably be discussed with him on how he feels, but probably only if you two are married. If you are a reliable and trustworthy guy with kids, then there shouldn't be a problem. If you're not trustworthy, she shouldn't be living with you with the kids.  Talking about it is the key. The father, assuming he's still an active part of the kids' lives, should be able to help make that call. He is still their biological father. If he's not part of their lives, though, it should be Mom's call.|`|kIblsxJQaa	all depends on what sort of person the boyfriend is and how long the relationship has been going on and his relationship with the children|`|5k7BexD3aa	To me, there's a big difference between being a boyfriend and a stepfather..  If you had kids, would you want your wife's new boyfriend to babysit them?|`|L3TBbe7Zaa	Me being the man I am would say, If I am available I would watch my kids at all times. It is not about anything other than wanting to spend as much time with my kids as possible. It would have nothing to do with your new man.
MzqZGvalaa	Jeez that's stretching the family thing a bit far.  Even the Catholic Church has no problem with this.  The blood between them is soooo thin it's almost water anyway.  There's a lot weirder out there, this wouldn't even make it on to Springer.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	if they have babies they will have 2 heads|`|mxrlZEweaa	Technically they are family, but not in the weird sense. Just tell her that it wouldn't work out because they are relatives. Don't tell her that it's disgusting, and don't be harsh. Just tell her that her family wouldn't approve. Be nice to her.|`|75SSAFsPaa	my daughter thought she loved her first cousin but it was just a phase that she laughs about now with laura her other cousin who had a crush on her other cousin|`|uhL6jzhQaa	They're still related, but they're still closely related enough that if they somehow had children, there could be health issues.   Just tell her that for the sake of morality and her future offspring, don't try anything. There is a whole planet of men out there.

5fjbNeVNaa	Hi hi, thanks for your help. Time to get down to business.    Sorry to hear about your ex, that really must have been embarassing. Dating her friend could make her mighty jealous, or she would just say that she doesnt care. Her friend might like you, but she also might not go out with you because she doesnt want to lose her friend as a friend. There would be a lot of drama.    I do have to say this, you have to do what you think is right. It could go either way.|`|Vr6L81iiaa	tough question you've got there. my opinion is simply this, you two are doing some harmless flirting that maybe you should continue doing but nothing more. the fact that she is your ex's best friend can cause trouble so the only one to make the most important move in this relationship is the ex. if she doesn't like the fact of you going out with her best friend then there is simply nothing you can do, but on the other hand if she is alright with it then wait for her best friend make the first move. If you have a hard time figuring it out, make sure that you know the best friend like you back and ask your ex if its alright with her. if you and your ex are still very close then she should understand.   explain to your ex that you like her best friend and wanted her permission to ask her out because you didn't know if it was alright with her.  Good Luck!|`|DPJRlxOwaa	If you care about your ex that much, probably dont go out with her good friend. But if you really like em both, try it and if you feel too guilty than dump your ex's friend.|`|YoLI7onHaa	Talk to your ex. Tell her how you feel and ask how she would feel. And if it goes well maybe you will have her support.
rd5468H1aa	Don't do it; if that's your exe's best friend, you'll definitely hurt her in the process because maybe she's not fully over you yet.|`|546f8e582c11c31d20c750213d4c7bbbaa	go for it, you're only 15 and a half once!!!

P.S- Why don't you keep your hair long, and not worry about her cutting her hair?  That way, everyone's happy.|`|EyYrYXFhaa	1st off you seem really nice...and koodoes 2 you, i wish i had a man who did what i wanted him 2 do 4 mi.

Try talking to her about it honestly and calmly.|`|aF1IXKjTaa	Simple: Don't do things she doesn't like.|`|JTaEUcl1aa	that's not a double standard. It's how she prefers to look. Let her do what she wants to her personal appearance, as well as you should. If you're in love looks shouldn't matter that much..especially hair styles.|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	Lols! Is this all about hair?    Leastwise she did call you handsome! Maybe she just cuts her hair to try on new looks. You know how women are. They wanna try out different hairstyles...    Well, when my boyfriend has a bad haircut I tell him honestly. He had a good haircut recently and I gave him compliments.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	It's a common misconception that fashion is about women trying to attract men. Really, fashion is about competing with other females. She's not dressing for you, she's dressing for them.     As for *your* hair, you are an accessory. Like a nice purse, you need to look good to impress other women, and make them jealous.    Maybe she'll grow out of it, eventually.|`|7YHmkdfXaa	Man, you are going to be dealing with this all of your life. Dont even try to understand it, just learn to deal with it and move on.

This happens with many women as in the missionary position man can control the movement much better and some men in fact prefer to take out and insert again which gives them much pleasure. In women on top position it is not possible to ensure that penis remains inside always. I have found one solution. If your partner agrees , allow his penis to lie on his tummy and instead of taking it inside , rub your clit very vigorously again it. You would find that you are reaching a climax never reached before ! In fact you can go on and have multiple climaxes like this ! of course then you have to allow your partner to have intercourse in some other fashion.|`|11SCey7Xaa	Maybe it isnt hard.|`|3c2d62279c0725273058507451c39522aa	try leaning back a little more and really grinding down on top of him|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	Viagra?|`|Uxb97PVtaa	your going up too high|`|qqb4xdpQaa	just lean back more, your probably leaning forward to hold yourself up on his chest.
TxsnvnrSaa	Honestly the only reason you think older guys are nicer and treat you better is because they are better and more experienced than your younger guys. They are better at getting to girls and everything in between.     So...it's not that they are nicer, its because they are more experienced|`|zWqKuIQuaa	It's not for us to say.  Talk about it with your parents.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	Yes you are too young to date older guys. Put your education first  1 because these older guys will not get you that fat paycheck you need today when prices on everything are going up. they treat u better, they pay more attention to u, they're nicer. Just overall they're sweeter and kinder to u because they want to get you in bed. sure you can defend and protect yourself when your alert n sober but what about the 17 year old football player you meet at some party that wants to get you in bed. and you cant fend him off because he lifts 120 pound weights at school or if they drug you or spike your drink. do something to you that u don't know about until u wake up naked. then later your belly starts showing. 15 -17 year old pregnant n don't know who the dad is. how would parents like that.|`|68msDkYUaa	if you think you can handle it then its good but still i would say wait for another 4 years if you could....tk cr|`|yTTXjQSmaa	Well as a fellow teen, all i can say is that to find someone you have fun with that respects you. You're young soo you're not gonna marry the guy right? I think that your safety comes first no matter what and your happiness. =D|`|rKsgGHKkaa	no i dnt think ur too young to date. i totally get wut u mean bout guys ur own age being so immature! thats y i dnt date. ive been told im very mature 4 my age so i knw how u feel. but if u think u can defend ur self and will b able to take on more responsibility with older guys i say go for it if u wanna date older guys.  ...but not too old|`|UldvbAIWaa	ya u wont beable to protect yourself against a guy thats strong than you first off. and ya the older guys have had more practice they know to get in a girls pants you gotta act like you dont want it and the girl is a princess.  sorry but ya. you gotta find someone like me that wants a relationship to be with the person not for sex. but you wont be able to tell... so ya go for w.e you think is right|`|QBGszg3waa	lol defend/protect. Trust me you dont. How would u stop a guy who is 6'3 and 210 , you wouldnt. Date your own age, please. i just dont want anything bad to happen to u. :)|`|JVrjveubaa	hm..well it all depends. normally i would say wait. i think the mature part is really important. i don't know you personally but my rule is this. for high school don't date someone over a year older than you, it almost never works and it just becomes to much to handle. at some point the older(in your case)guy will probably want something more in your relationship or will go off to collage and meet someone else there fore you will either make a wrong decision, or get hurt. not saying that this might not happen with someone our own age or close to it but its more likely to happen with older people. so my say is yes. don't date older than at least 16. i don't know if this will help you at all, i sorta feel like im just going on about nothing d not making sense but oh well. good luck
nT40UC4Oaa	Yep, wrong category- yeah, I think it'll happen.|`|if3X4GDdaa	you should probably as this is the religion section. but since you asked    yea i think its true, but im also christian    its a very hard book to understand|`|JVrjveubaa	yes its true. im also a christian so that is what i believe. its a very hard book to understand and im actually learning about it in bible class. but it talks about what will happen mostly
Yl9gFLTZaa	Ahahahaha, that's common in poor classes, and poor classes, are the mexicans who go to USA, so they're what you r seeing hahahaha.|`|u70TaWI5aa	No I just think those are just some horny people you live by. Really it is the older mexican and the ones that just jumped the fence that really do that. I am mexican but born and raised here, and most of the younger mexicans from mexico are more respectful. So I believe it is just guys that live by you and were just not brought up right.|`|lBLn7E13aa	girls stare 2 its just the way we are we are horny people lol|`|jvoXI6hOaa	JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA! woooow...do you take me back!!!    Yes, it's a Mexico thing, we don't do it as obviously here in the US...but if i was back in Mexico...i'll prolly holler something like..."Ay chiquitita...te acompa?o mija?"...jajaja...My advice is...just take it as a compliment and if you like one of them...give'em a foxy look back...make out a little...have some fun girl...just don't sleep with em...if you don't wanna stay in Mexico and start a life there...anywho...enjoy it...it's a cultural thing as well i would say...cus it happens more often in pueblos.|`|gv7unj2Waa	If your a fine *** looking white girl...yes and if your just cute or pretty or have a nice body, then yes too. Its cuz we are mexicans and we like good things.|`|b014304b2f33826aff76bac12ae888cfaa	ok, im a girl, and im not mexican, but i like in a small farming community with alot mexican illegal aliens..their kinda the majority lol. anyway, i work in the fields with them, and they are very straightforward, and they will not hesitate to stare, or whistle, or yell or try to talk to you in spanish, especially if your white....and it is relentless. Iv never had one grab me or anything..that might be cuz my mom is the boss...but i think alot of it has to do with their culture. in mexico, women are not respected as much as they are in U.S. so the men treat them like animals...its ok to beat them, etc. I know the same can be said for some white guys too...but from my experience, its mostly mexican guys.    im not racist or anything...and im part hispanic...my mom is el salvadorian, and my dad is white...and the mexican women are some of the nicest ppl you will meet...and they love to cook for you lol!|`|c3W9o5Wcaa	yeah most of them are like that especially the ones ho just came from mexico.btw im mexican but im not like that soo its not all mexicans but most..especially the old ones haha|`|epms9mayaa	ok. You say your not racast, but do you go up to that hispanic guy and ask them if the mexican. There are alot of hispanic men who look "mexican"but aren;t and alot who are.    Well,to awnser your question, I felt a little freaked out too when i saw a hispanic man stare me down too and I too did say mexicans as well as you. I always told myself I am never going to be with a "mexican" man. Just because I felt they were dogs in the streets and that was what i grew up with.    Five years down  the road, I am still with a MEXICAN. Yes I have been with my daughters father for almost six years. It was a slap in my face, but he is the sweetest and kindess man I have ever been with. He has a loving family who loves me and my daughter. he is also a great provider and RESPECTS me like a woman.    I know that there is most def. perverts out there,but I just wanted to let you know that they are not all like that! and when some iggonarnt man does do that don;t give them the attention they want . Walk with your head high, like if there not ****.     Hope that helps : )
Yf8yZVM9aa	Well; first off; thanx for commenting. now; it doesnt sound like you like him(ur current bf) too much. dont waste your time on maybes. tell him that you want to brake up; but make absolutley sure that he knows that it was nothing that he did. that you need to find someone that u are deeply infatuated with; and you know that this is gonna hurt him; but he can't love you too much if you can't feel the same way back. tell him that you dont think its fair to him to continue with him; that he deserves someone who really wants him and no one else. then; after you make sure that he knows that you dont hate him and he's okay; go to your ex and tell him that you still have huge feelings for him and ask him if you could get back together. if he says yes; i wish you both the best. if not; try to go out there and find someone that could love equally or more than your ex. but whatever you do; do not break up with ur bf and then if u get rejected; come back to him. that will make him feel like a last resort. really think about your desicion  before you do it. and then; go out and find someone worthy of your time. it sounds kinda mean; but you really shouldnt waste a moment. there could be a guy waiting out there for you and you wouldnt know because you're with a guy you kinda love. love him fully; or find someone you love fully. i hope to keep in touch and i hope this was helpful. if anything offended you; please tell me; cuz i only meant to help. ttyl!|`|wrw92W0Taa	live your life accordingly, do what makes you happy and what YOU think is rite, thats what I have done my hole life and now I am happily pregnant with a baby girl and I am getting married|`|CqJnT2Oqaa	Maybe the best thing to do in this situation would be to break up with your boyfriend.  Tell him that you really like him, but you still have feelings for your ex, and you think he deserves better then that.  Maybe you two can try again once you get your feelings sorted out.  It might help if you think about why your ex is no good for.  Don't get so carried away that you hate him, and it's not good to dwell on bad thoughts, but make sure that you see him for what he really was, not what you wanted him to be.  If you think you can get over your ex, then you don't have to break up, but maybe you should explain how you feel to your boyfriend.  See what he thinks and what he wants to do.  Just make sure you don't talk about your ex to him very often.|`|wUkU3HVwaa	i feel the same way  exactly!  break up with him and if you like him still then you'll miss him but wait at least a week to really realise if you like him or if it's just because you feel nostalgic.  good luck babe    first one's are always the worst to get over|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	most likely he just wants to hump =[ so just do whatcha want lifes too short but be polite|`|15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	You need to tell ur boyfriend that you need more time to sort out your feelings. Tell him that it's not about him or something he did but you are just not sure about what you want from yourself or the relationship right now and whether you want it or not.    Tell him that you just cannot dupe him or keep him on tethers but since you have no idea yourself, you just can't help it.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	You cheated on him(your other question) and you love your ex?  You are the worst thing that could happen to a man.|`|0GB2sWA0aa	try talking to your ex and boyfriend  tell them how you feel  downplay it a bit, done say LOVE if you tell your boyfriend about your ex, just say not over  and stuff like that  but let them know|`|KUZrSrrBaa	well, you could start off by paying attention in english class so I can understand what you're trying to ask :)|`|YZhD94WEaa	You need to tell your current boyfreind the truth and stop leading him on. If you are stuck on your ex he should know about it. Sure it will problably hurt him now but he will get over it, rather then holding on to something he cant even touch. LET HIM GO or one day you will find yourself on the opposite side of this situation, CARMA is FOREVER.|`|mfHq20pqaa	Do what you gotta do.  Chances are neither one of those guys will be in your future.  Your still young!   People change they grow up and move on.  Don't stress the things you cannot change and focus on what you can change.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You really need to talk to him, be honest.  You don't want to tell your boyfriend now that you love when you don't.  Never say something you don't feel.      If you can't let go of an old relationship, then you cannot be in a new one.  You must let go before you can move on.    Sit down with him and tell him, you have feelings for him.  Tell him you still have deep feelings for your ex and it is not fair to him for you to go on like this when you can't let go of the old.  He may be upset, but he will respect you more.  You have to do it.  Open and honest communication are a must in any relationship.|`|cppCHcpFaa	It's simple.  For you current boyfriends sake, forget your ex.  It's not fair for him if you to feel this way, you shouldn't of started dating this current guy if you still liked your ex.   (ex's don't come about without reason) If you keep going back to your past then you shall never progress in relationships, my advice would be to move on.. if you really cannot manage moving on and actually (love) your ex as you claim, let your boyfriend know about this but be as calm and honest as you can though.   Whatever you do, do not push him away, it's either remain together or be friends.  Hope this helped.
AA10423276	you should see a psychaitrist. i think you have trust issues and you cannot stay in a long term relationship. i think you have many other issues too. its bad for your mental health and for the safety of your kids. you're screwing up their psychology too you know. you're destroying a lot of lives UNINTENTIONALLY. please no offense but pleaseeeee see a psychaitrist first and make up your mind who you want to be with and only have sex with that one guy.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Question is who do you love more?  What do YOU want?  If I were you, I would stay with your current husband, so you wouldn't confuse the child why mommy's had so many different partners.  Also, if the guy you're seeing is getting possessive, I'm sure that's not the best characteristic you want in a future husband.  I would say you end things with the guy and focus on your child and marriage.    He might be bitter and become violent, so I suggest you move as well.|`|EENUWAP7aa	People get married and have a wonderful relationship and still meet wonderful people all the time after wards. You just have to come to terms to realize what you have already and build that up to your desire instead of roaming from one relationship to another.    Some times people get divorced someone else who they are more content with and happy and other times they find themselves back to behind the 8 ball.    The honest approach within yourself is the best policy to follow and just because your current marriage is not what you would expect it do be doesn't give you the green light to search for something else and drop what you have either.    In any marriage there will be ups and downs. I personally have met wonderful women that crossed my path that really made me think, gosh, I should've waited before I got married, but then I realize this is normal and they will cross my path every day as I continue on my marriage I currently have, but it gives me no sense to drop what I have and take a better color when in fact the most precious color is present in my life already.|`|YdUqwCpOaa	I think u are not sure what u want? First, make sure what u want? I think we should satified with what we have otherwise at the end of the day we have to regret for our mistake.|`|pTjN7hODaa	YEs your right you need Help, so please get it> something bad will happen if you dont.

QQcAl1eqaa	You have too much time on your hands and not enough chances to seek other opportunities (like other girls).  Why don't you take some more classes, go to the gym, practice a martial art, read, get a job or another job, take care of sick relatives, volunteer, go out and party -- do anything, but don't just sit around thinking about someone who probably isn't thinking about you.|`|av8SeB3Naa	Ask her out.|`|ueCUixvQaa	nejhtsjyyy

Rrd4Gxvcaa	A lame date would be looking at art or something like that.    An average date would be bowling or a movie    A good date would be a nice dinner, going to an amusement park, taking a walk in the park, stargazing    An awesome date would be a helicopter tour of your local big city with dinner or a picnic somewhere, going to the beach for the day and eating at a nice oceanside restaurant, etc.    Although it doesn't necessarily have to be extravagant to be an awesome date, a night in playing board games and making dinner would be cool too :)

OR "What are you doin' this friday night? You wanna go see _______?"    But it dosent have to be a movie, it could be dinner.

So stop wasting time and ask her, because if you wait to long she is going to figure your just playing around with her and she'll lose interest.|`|ez2tlSvJaa	I think you shouldn't pay attention to your friends if you like her and you think she likes you back well you should give her a red rose and ask her to be your girlfriend it could work girls love roses always keep that in mind. Good luck.|`|Vr6L81iiaa	I don't think you are in love sorry my friend. What you should do is try and get her attention like talk to her more but try not to over tease it gets annoying and sometimes if the girl it sensitive then it could hurt her feelings. Make small conversations every now and then to get closer to her and when it feels right, ask her to hang out or go to a movie or or something. Don't straight out ask "do you want to be my girlfriend?" it gets sort of awkward for the girl. After a couple of dates or just hanging out with each other simply say.   "Look we've been spending a lot of time together and i was wondering if we're just friends or more then friends." everything should go pretty smoothly from there.
n195n9Avaa	Can't tell without a pic but if he doesn't give you the attention you need get rid of him...simple as that.    Good Luck|`|xHKRGEg4aa	your boyfriend may not pay you much attention because he things you already know your cute. but if you dont feel like he gives you what you deserve, dump him & find someone that will treat you right.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	you sound pretty  if he doesnt show you attention  maybe hes not interested anymore  ask him why he doesnt  maybe its time to breakup|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	do you think you are. dum your bf and find a guy that thinks your beautiful|`|tsdHndRhaa	sure why not.|`|n8eRg88Faa	Well this guy is obviously ether blind or totally stupid...cause you sound beautiful:)|`|W7ZfFxTxaa	you sound pretty,but the problem here is you have no confidence in yourself and may be you are rushing to him,be confident ,show less interest in him ,i am sure he will pay you attention ,if he wont i will ha ha....
3YfYWpAsaa	I would personally suggest you break it off, because any boyfriend that pushes a girl AND cheats on her is not worth keeping.  I broke up with my g/f but i realized it was a mistake and told her that... and i love her to death and was great to her and i was cool and all that... and she STILL doesnt wanna get back with me (i never asked her that Q, but i can tell).    you should be like my exgf- dont take any sh*t.  as much as im sad that she wont get back with me, im proud of her, for having strength and a backbone to do what she feels is right. you should do the same.    ===============    Next  thing, don't sell yourself out like a cheap hooker.  Just because you break it off with this fagbag doesn't mean that you need to start spreadin ur legs to guy  2... u feel me?  How about you stay single for awhile? I mean, you DID go out with the guy 11 months!  take a break!    As for what your b/f did, that's absolutely horrible the cheating part.    ======================================...    BUTTTTT..... since I always give perfect and complete answers, if you actually wanted to salvage your relationship with this guy, it would be a tough long road, but here are the steps I would advise:    1) slowwwly stop hanging out with him as much    2) tell your stepdad that he's not being a good boyfriend, and to please NOT be nice to him or hang out with him.  If your stepdad is redneck and hates you, tell him that you love him and PLEASE dont because he ignores you and cheats on you, and you love him and really want to save your relationship.  unless your stepdad is the antichrist, he should understand that and feel sorry for you, and help you out!    tell him that no matter what happens, to tell your b/f he's busy if ur bf asks, and to NEVER tell ur b/f that you told him to say this.  (This will make him bored/lonely, and want to hang with you more)    3) The fact that you AND your stepdad hang with him less will make him want you back.    4) When he starts being nice to you, that shows he really wants you again; start loving him again, but STILL dont hang out with him that much; NEVER call or text him unless its an emergency or u want to hang out with him that exact moment, never call just to say hi; and NEVER act clingy in person.  act sexy, flirt with him, look into his eyes, hold his hands, turn toward him, smile, and kiss him.... but if he ever acts like he doesnt want you, dont pout or act like u care.. and if he says he wants you to leave, JUST LEAVE! he will realize that he DOESNT want you to leave... and he wont say that next time!    5) You need to have a serious convo with him. however, DO NOT set it up, and DO NOT say you want to haev a talk with him! in the MIDDLE of an enjoyable discussion, bring up off-handedly that you want to get some things straight. tell him that you both havent been treating each other right, and u want him to agree to some rules from now on, and that if he breaks them, ITS OVER! tell him no cheating, no pushing, etc. and you'll agree not to do stuff that bugs him (u know what it is, but i dont. im just an online guy.)      He should agree. If he doesn't say these exact words: "well, ill talk to you again when you wanna act like a man and actually take responsibility for urself, and work at this relationship." then just nod ur head at him and leave.     DONT ACT SAD; DONT ACT ANGRY; DONT CRY; DONT ACT REMORSEFUL; Just act matter-of-factly and a LITTLE disappointed at him.  This will get him thinking, and he will realize "u know what? I DO love her! I DO want her! I WILL get back on track... shes worth it!"    6) stop being friends with those dirty skanks.  SERIOUSLY.  Drop all communication with any of them that ur bf cheated with.  dont invite them over. dont mention them at all. cuz they HATE you/are jealous of you secretly, and they are not worth your time. They will, in fact, HURT you to still have them in your life. No AMOUNT of apologies are OK, because that WAS NOT a simple mistake, like if they hit u or screamed. THAT WAS A PRE-MEDITATED ACT OF PURE HATRED AND DISRESPECT.  NOTHING can EVER make that better; nothing can EVER change the way they feel about you. they will ALWAYS want to backstab you. some girls are just like that. they're trash.    7) and lastly, if you want to make the relationship with ur current b/f work... STOP LIKING THE OTHER GUY!!!!! girls tend to like what they cant have! if you stopped and thought REALLY HARD abuot it, im sure you would find that you would rather be with your b/f for 10 months, then with that guy for 10 months.      and im sure you would realize that ALOT of guys would get jealous and angry and resentful (and MAYBE even cheat) if they thought their girlfriend was cheating on them and liked another guy more!    and you would ALSO realize that this guy you like, after 10 months, wouldnt be much better (maybe worse) than the guy you're with.  ======================================...|`|n195n9Avaa	He likes to place blame on you and make you feel bad about yourself.  He obviously has problems and is emotionally abusing you.  I see this stuff all the time, it is not good and doesn't get good.     A person who really loves someone doesn't be mean to them and doesn't do anything to make that person feel bad about themself. You wouldn't do that to him so why let him do it to you?    Get out of that relationship and find someone who will treat you good..    Good Luck Honey|`|0QRTXIL2aa	You are an idiot. you know what to do, you know everything you just wrote was wrong. are you a doormat? you dont even need to ask this, you know what to do, so do it.|`|ql0RmOLiaa	leave him now....go out and have fun....settle down later...you can only shed so many tears over a guy before you stop giving a sh** trust me i stayed in that same situation...still am after 3 yrs......and its shitty...so be single date around and have fun plz!!!|`|bDHVE5uRaa	Reading your post makes me sad. I think I understand that you love your boyfriend, but it is clear to me that he does not love you because he isn't ready to. He's not very nice to you and is pushing you away.    Personally, just from what you have said, it is clear to me that you are better than him. Take the high road. Be strong! Move on. He is not worth it. Trust me.
AATmqYQ1aa	First of all...wow...what I dream. I bet you woke up like "What the f*ck what that?"    That does not make you gay...unless you where thinking about getting it on with another dude in real life. To me dreams don't mean s*it. You had a gay dream...so what? Get over it. If you think about it too much you are just going to end up dreaming about it again.    I'm giving you a STAR for this question...just because you gave me a good laugh.      much love!|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Yes it makes you gay, and this question doesn't really help your intelligence level either.    You threw in "Jesus" just to get a reaction.  If you can't be clever, just don't try.    (BTW, don't come back and try to say it's about your Mexican friend "Jesus")|`|AA11108018	Your such a jerk grow up your not gay|`|SNKVKZyCaa	wow! some dream. sounds like your inner man is trying to get in tune with something going on in your life. Try www.dreammoods.com for dream interpretations.|`|HhQtrjQGaa	not at all. dreams are always messed up. I would just brush it off. My fiance wakes up with a ***** every morning, no matter what...even if he wasn't dreaming.
JZkCVHJAaa	talk to him yourself tell him how you feel and what you want to do about it and assure him that your not a psycho freak|`|xHKRGEg4aa	explain it to him, write him a letter, im him, text him, whatever. Just tell him that you were too nervous to talk to him yourself, & you asked your guy friend to help you out. Tell him you didnt want your friend to do what he did, & your really sorry about all that. but that you really do like him.  be careful though, h e may use the embarrassment as an easy way to let you down because he doesnt really like you.  good luck.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Well  hopefully,  you learned  a  lesson  on  keeping  your  intimate  thoughts  'n  feelings  all  to  yourself.  Sometimes  you  can  trust  your  best  girl friend  about  these  things  'n  sometimes  you  can't.  It's  always  best  to  let  a  guy  approach  you  first.  Don't  get  ahead  of  him  and  run  with  it.  Let  him  be  the  man  and  take  the lead.  And  if  he  won't ,  then move on.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	how bout you talk to him your self|`|XDz1SIOwaa	i was in a similar samilar situation just tell the guy you like that you're sorry for what your friend did and thats not whatyou meant to happen but you like him and just wanted for him to know that. It works.    Hope this helps!!!|`|U4qK4YBgaa	ahhh, social psychology at work. Try talking to him alone, hes embarrassed because if he would have accepted the news positively he would have had to socially abandon all of the guys at the lunch table.....this is unlikely because peer pressure is rather strong and led to an embarrassed Hottie. My point is, try talking to him when all of those other guys aren't around. That's correct, you talk directly to him. You will be effectively diffusing a lot of the social forces that may have been effecting his behavior prior. Plus, if your younger I bet there is a 80% chance he likes you too but hes afraid to fight the social tides around him. Hope that Helps :).|`|IE9NfLGoaa	k|`|BRo2gNkqaa	talk to him yourself, and prove to him your not some weirdo so he is hearing from you and not your weirdo friend|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	tell him what you told us.  he should understand and if he still doesn't want you, move on.  it wasn't worth it.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Stop sending other people to do your dirty work.  If you truly like this guy, you'll actually talk to him yourself.|`|2iqSofzYaa	wait a little while, then try again, only with just the 2 of u. get his   call him and ask to meet him for a movie then have a pizza, talk, and have fun :)
JZkCVHJAaa	ask one of his friends how he feels about you or have one of your friends ask him|`|VIDh3oUVaa	yaaa u should seduces him and if u feel theres some attraction between u guys go on and tell him trust me|`|ziiYVYXZaa	try to seduce him, if it works then you can tell him...feel the attraction first!|`|w6T9JiHdaa	flirt|`|mP6naFLDaa	Wjhenever I fall in like with my friends I find it best to let them know and when (if) you fall out of like with them then let them know and it's better to know if he likes you then it is to not|`|blirKov3aa	when u are kiding ,u can try to grasp the chance  ask him:do u love me?----disguise u are kiding,then u can observe his expression, maybe u will understand something by doing this,|`|rOeUOFZOaa	First. Don't worry or overthink it. That's the worst thing you could do. Stay strong, confident, but quirky, fun, and a good friend. Tease him. Flirt.    Even flirt with other guy a bit but in harmless innocent "nice girl" ways. If they can imagine any other guys going out with you it'll make them jealous and see you as a great catch.    See what happens.... try asking him if you can kiss her some time. Do it in a cool, but also kind of shy way... guys find that really cute. That's how me and my fiance started going out ;) we ended up making out for almost an hour|`|0Pv2jt8faa	So, you can't even handle telling him how you feel, yet you want to try and forge a relationship with this guy?    Ahhh High School.|`|u72QPS8jaa	dont ask him out girl!  if a guy is interested enough he will i mean he WILL make a move!  a girl should never let go of her pride for a crush(maybe for true love)but not for a crush!  you know that saying 'people always want what they cant have' so flirt with him alittle lead him on and then eventually he will probably ask you out!love is patient so try that first instead of jumping into asking him out and praying for a good outcome and freak the heck out of him lol    also guys a really proud creatures so if you confess to him that you like him he may reject you even if hes alittle fond of you just to tell his friends you asked him out so hun becareful!  goodluck:)|`|546f8e582c11c31d20c750213d4c7bbbaa	it depends on his reaction to your flirting, also if he likes you, he'll probably do just about anything for you, test it out, if you are sitting on his couch tell him to go get you a drink while there are a lot of people around, see if he does it...|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Start Flirting and complimenting him on his biceps or something etc.  Tell him his eyes are nice, and that any girl would be lucky to have him. Mistake him for a celebrity that he looks like "Omg im sorry i thought it was Brad Pitt stting their" ask him if he likes anyone and tell him the girl he likes is lucky. i dont know... mix it up be flirty!|`|2xaBi6Whaa	be soo obvious u want to go out with him he wont feel like he will get rejected. thats my biggest fear. super embarrassing.  sooo ya flirt a lot in all classes u have with him and just do little stuff like write on his hand or other bullshit like that
NUWdgQuraa	Arg!  You astrologists kill me.    It sounds like a power play move.  It doesn't mean he is in love with you, although he may be.  It does mean that, for whatever reason, he wants you to be in love with him.  At best, he's shy.  At worst, he's just wanting you to boost his ego.
bb8813d6bca81de234195f3347ffb748aa	prepare yourself to get annoyed by some of the things that he does :-) My boyfriend and I moved in together 2 yrs ago  after being together for 3yrs. I thought I knew him very well, but you will get to know each other on a whole different level! it will be fun:-) Good luck
sJTPzFdlaa	Now why on earth would you date someone with a bad personality? Thats implies that you dont like them.

Lesson Learned.|`|DPJRlxOwaa	You didnt take the chance to knee him in the nuts? Girl you crazy.|`|vOukAHowaa	I would ask him if he was born a jackass or did he go to school to learn to be that stupid-|`|IfwpibHqaa	I would have booted him in the nuts he did ask for it|`|0ky4TktEaa	I'd happily oblige. Granted, i don't do the bar thing and i don't drink so it wouldn't be some drunken thing.|`|rqNb6FIraa	I would say no and run away. That man probably is a psycho who will try and rape me!

X5bsZh9aaa	heeey there,  i dont know if i'll be mucch help.  buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut  maybe he sees you as more of a sister/good friend than a potential girlfriend & wants to stay that way, so he wont wreck any future chance of being friends if you go out then break up, i mean, most school relationships dont last.  but then again, maybe he likes you, but is trying not to make it obvious, because he doesnt want to feel tied down if he goes out with you.  but maybe he just doesnt know himself,  who honestly understand the male brain (no offence guys, i'm not trying to sound mean)  just maybe tell him hbow you feel  hope i helped :)|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Don't ever ask to be "rated" by a guy  if your in a relationship with him and he doesnt say 10, hes screwed (or not?)    if your not in a relationship and asks, if he says something high then he likes you. low would be the common sense thing to do if you either dont like or dont want to have opinion known.

Looks like he enjoyed it =)|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	Stop right there!!!!    you're worried about that???? what the heck??? you did just fine.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	well if its your first time you cant go to fast, u just have to let it naturally come to you and you will no if he wants more;-)|`|56MmKc5caa	Sounds better then my first kiss it was a french kiss the guy put his tongue in my mouth and made circles. He almost choked me it was awful.|`|nA97uWdyaa	We want you be happy and just be in the moment, not trying to analyze everything. Focus on your senses and taking everything in: his scent, the way his hands feel on you, the heat from his body, whatever sensations come to you just be open to it and think of the warm feelings he has for you.|`|LMqjgbHoaa	It is very hard to explain how to kiss in words. When you kissed him did you press your lips on his real hard? Flip your tongue around in his mouth like a madwoman? If you did these things you did it wrong. First of all, you gently put your lips to his,kinda soft kisses,no tongue for a minute,Then slowly if he starts putting his tongue in your mouth, you don't act like you are chewing food,LOL. Just everything nice and slow. You don't want to clank teeth! Little bit of tongue at first ,maybe even for awhile,depends on how hot things are. This is very hard to explain. Practice on your arm,I'm serious! not licking your arm, LOL. But at least the feel of soft kisses.You don't want to act like you are licking a melting ice cream cone,real fast! slowly,slowly. Then you two will get the feel for each other in time,and it will come natural. You won't even think about it.

How would you feel if someone wanted to break you up from someone you love?|`|aLgY4l3Naa	If you don't like your friends boyfriend its your right not to, but don't go breakup their relationship because of your feelings, that so not right!! If you don't like being around him, when he is around go some were else your not committed to hang around when he is there!! Let there relationship be, if they are not going to make it it should be for there own reasons not because of you!! Good luck to you and i hope you rethink that whole idea!
CENwFQr1aa	actually earlier she knew that u had a crush on her after u had rejected her. so maybe its possible that she still thinks dat u repent rejecting her proposal, and so she tries to make u feel jealous n stupid. dont pay any attention to her, she'll herself become alright then, or u can also flirt around with other girls infront of her, she'll automatically stop all that she's doing.|`|CU1WRghVaa	xD shes is totally wants you. Thats a good move dude. You were interested in her but now you don't. and She wants you to be interested in her still so shes making you jealous.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	Thats pretty obvious bro! She wanted you and you pretty much said NAH not gonna happen! So she moved on, and when she seen that you started to like her, she took this for granted and pretty much rubbed it in your face! As if it was a HAHA look what you could have had! If i was you i would just not even look her way! Girls will be girls! If you just laugh at her when she does, she will more than likely stop!|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	Dude, when a chick flirts with guys around you, she's testing to see if you get jealous. She likes you way too much.|`|T2RjJdhbaa	looks like she loves the attention or shes trying to to make you jelous|`|H6l7rxNnaa	sounds like shes just being a tease, go for her if you are interested if not then just ignore her she probably still wants your attention even though the two of you have history, dont stress it just move foward and if you dont like her right now why are you making a whole thing about how its bothering you that shes flirting with other guys right infront of your face.. ever think of that? :)|`|b6e8a23e8ce0872697abf94a37d4524caa	She probably likes the attention and self esteem boost from knowing someone has a crush on her.  Perhaps she's feeling a bit insecure and  she wants to get you to react so that she can feel sought after and desireable again.  Girls can be insecure like that.|`|f120d9b30884a763a4f93cef49dee32eaa	She's trying to make you jealous.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	So if you don't like her then why you posting questions about her. Get over it and move on she probably thinks she can have you or Simply just making you jealous.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Yeah the perfect explanation...you are teenagers.

aLgY4l3Naa	Well when you love someone, you RESPECT them and your girlfriend apparently does not know that!! I think you need to make a choice to love and respect yourself more then to take this kind of treatment from this girl or anyone else, you deserve to be treated with love and respect not a door mat!! So don't delay, talk to her and let her know this is not acceptable to you what so ever so she needs to make a decision YOU or THOSE OTHER GUYS and leave the ball in her court, what ever she decides is up to her but don't lose yourself over her, there are too many girls out there for you to cry about this one who apparently is not worth it!!  If you don't end up with her don't worry because you will find love again, just give yourself time!! Good luck to you!!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	dont be heartbroken over a girl, we really aren't worth it. Especially not if she's going to treat you like that. If she really "loves" you, she wouldnt hold hands with another guy. She would be flirting with you, trying to cuddle up close to you.
0AYPgUQIaa	Honey, if you don't want to look like a 12 years old kid, don't ask questions like these.

GBr9YngTaa	Ever think that he likes you for the way you are? If you changed, what if he didn't like you and broke up with you? Yes I understand that he doesn't like the flaws in his past, but than I don't think you're a prime example of them. Don't change, adjust. Leave his past in the past, I know it's hard to get past, but he doesn't like his past so why bring it up? Out of respect for him and sanity for you just stop. If you catch yourself change the subject. He's with you now for a reason, so don't let yourself be apart of his past if you keep bringing it up.|`|AnIgXRcJaa	It's in past for a reason.  Think about that.   They are called x's.   Mistakes.  The end.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Your really not over him doing whatever he did and it still bothers you. You just have to think of the better things that have happened not the bad stuff...its hard but it can be done..and you also may not REALLY trust him mentally in your head.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Believe in change and say "yes we can".  just like Obama, it works|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Well either you really forgive him from the heart or you move on. Accept that he has done this, and there is nothing you can do about it now. It's not fair to keep bringing it up, and just don't let the past ruin the present or the future. If you really love him you should have the ability to forgive him aswell. People make mistakes, the the one who forgives is the bigger and better person =]|`|mHXLJKzRaa	no dont change, be yourself it is good to remember stuff. there is a good quote that says    "forgive but dont forget" that is the wise  "forgive and also forget" that is the fool  "dont forgive but do forget" that is also a fool      it seems like you are having problems with boyfriends, girls always pick boyfriends that are similar to their recent one in hopes of finding a more perfect one, why dont you try searching other different types of boys maybe its best suited for your personality. dont change i hope u dont cause thats really good that you do that. just because he treats you nicer than the rest doesnt automatically makes him mr. perfect, it just means you have been through rough times with your past experiences with dating boys and now you dont want to lose it because you're desperate to find a rare one but believe me there are more guys who will care for you til the end. if i were you i would start dating when i get into college i think ur still in high school......    and about going in the past and changing lol....... thats just empty guy promises, how do i know? lol im a guy lol, he will say anything to make you less mad. what he is describing is called regrets but if he keeps doing it over and over then wow he's a really deep guy isnt he who thinks before he acts lol. it seems like your insecurity with emotional abuses is leading you to the path of changing even yourself well i say dont, now changing a bad habit like smoking now thats a good idea but your real self nahhhhh if i were you i'd rather change boyfriends much less of a hassle. and last but not least, if you get a new boyfriend and he does a mistake, DO tell him his past mistake, and see if he changes and tries to fix it. If a guy cannot change for you then who will he change for?!?? so dont listen to these other ppl who tel u to change, although i like obama's changes, in this situation dont change, just speak less of it. three strikes and you're out hahaha|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Think before you speak,,simple as that. I used to do the same thing to my b/f. It's pointless though since he can't change his past and I'm sure if he could go back and change some things he would. It isn't right to criticize someone for something they can't do anything about. Try not to think about the things that bother you. When you do, try thinking about something else.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	If it's bothering you so much, what makes you think you should change? Are you sure you're not changing your beliefs or opinions just because you're afraid he'll leave you?    Just remember, you can't change him either, and you certainly can't change his past. What you need to do is have a calm, rational, discussion with him about the things that bother you. Once all questions have been answered, if you're satisfied, STOP BRINGING IT UP. If he shared his past with you, it's because he trusted you...and he probably trusted you to accept him, despite his flaws.

But I'm more leaning towards the first one.   I know exactly how you feel with the sicky stomach shaky feeling, this happened to me EVERY day in one of my classes for about two months because I sat behind a very groovy guy who I would ask for paper/pencils for every class. Even for such a lame excuse it took me so long to build up the courage to ask him.  So anyways I think he likes you =) If he's a friend just remember that and treat him like any other friend.  I wish you like in your boy troubles =)   Good luck honey!|`|ql0RmOLiaa	he likes you. talk to him. joke with him. hell like it.|`|pX8qJzjIaa	I agree with alice|`|ItEUj0miaa	Just talk to him if your cute guys like girls who want to talk to them ask him about him guys like to talk about themselves.|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Don't be worried about the "nerd" part.

GL btw :)|`|GL6WkpONaa	u should talk to him and.....it il work....i just know it! :)|`|K7jjvnjpaa	if he makes a move or talks to you, admit that you like him, but tell him you are very nervous about it. That way he knows how you feel and he wont feel like you hate him or are ignoring him. Being honest is the best thing to do. If he is as good as you say he is, he wont stop talking to you or be weird if he doesn't feel the same way. And look at this way, has rejection ever killed anyone? No. If you think that, you will be able to admit it. But let him know you go painfully slow and you are painfully nervous around him and you need time.|`|AWiM2aMhaa	If he's staring at you he probably likes you but he's too shy, try looking back at him and smiling, just acknowledge him even if you're nervous that might be enough to make him confident enough to talk to you.    Or if he's a jerk he could just be messing with you, either way I'd recommend that, or if you feel up to it you can even go talk to him but I'm guessing that's out of the question because you said you were shy...|`|giIRzafsaa	pleese know that if any one stares at you, they like you. his staring at you is his way of showing that i likes you with out the embarrassing thought of you rejecting him. the best way to get him to talk to you, is to flirt with him or make convo with him. make it known that are interested in him. or if you show interest in some one else, it might force him into talking to you. make him feel like his territory is being threatened. but don't make your self seem unattainable. this might make him get scared away.|`|hbrtQXX2aa	how old are you?  are you old enough to think about it?    ask your self it this thing that you feel is "love" or just an "infatuation"  better ask yourself and be true don't lie to yourself girl!    if you are just looking for him physically so this is just an "infatuation"  but if you really care for his personality as a person, well you are matured enough to talk about "love".    you better know the difference of this two all by yourself.    enjoy life, don't focus on 'lil unimportant things    hope i'll help|`|yuOHfCP4aa	if ur gunna tell him u like him... please, please, please DO NOT write it in a letter... ur grammer is shocking!    just ask    there is no harm in just asking
Z3a1cRL7aa	I would love it if my girl did that, exactly like that.  I love her cooking more than any restaurant, and finger desserts are always fun.  If you do decide to get some lingerie, I recommend www.yandy.com  You can get really cute things there at reasonable prices.  I get my fiance' stuff from there a couple times a year, and she loves them.  The lap dance should excite him, but I would practice some move before hand, you don't want to look awkward.  Have fun and be safe!  +10?|`|AA10178659	No need to do anything, just marry him.|`|3EM66IWFaa	My suggestion is keep your belly half empty,(if your belly is full will fall in sleep quickly) don't be more intoxicated, select a place out side house with full privacy where you can have gentle Breeze, moonlight and song of birds, Have your sex there as Adam&Eve done lying on earth without a bed or carpet.

AL66sW0daa	smiling at you is always a VERY good sign :)    if she talks about you, especially if you're not around, wondering where you're at    basically doing anything she doesn't do normally or when she's with her friends.    I know it can be hard to tell sometimes.  If you are shy, then if you get any feeling at all that she might like you, then she probably really does because guys who are shy usually wouldn't realize a woman liked them unless she like, took her top off or something (which she won't if she has any class at all).  If you're not sure if she likes you, then she probably does...I hope that maybe made a little sense!    If you get the feeling she might, then be open to taking a chance with her.  I hate to say this, but she will probably want you to ask her out.  girls love to be asked out, and don't worry if you're bad at it or a little uncomfortable...all the good girls will probably find it cute :)|`|fMyZIcCCaa	blushing when you look at her  crosses her leg to face you (not rle common tho)  smiles a lot around you  eye contact  bites her lip   laughs at all your jokes even if there dumb as hell  teases you (only if she is rle outgoing tho)  blinks a LOT  asks a lot of questions about you  flipping her hair  compliments you  always trying to look good in front of you  trying rle hard not to trip in front of you (mostly for clumsy girls tho)  gets embarrassed easily around you and no one else  talking a lot in general not shuting up   \  there are so many really so ask her friends if she talks about you|`|wKXCBCsJaa	if she sucks ur dick|`|UQTktOw3aa	if shes interested in you shell flirt like act different or be bitchy 2 her friends but the main thing to do is go up to the girl and say oh i heard a rumour that yu liked me|`|0D6eLDhXaa	Generally if I walk straight up to a guy and tell him I'd tap that all I'm looking for is a good time or two.

And, it really depends on the girl. If you know her really well, then you know what to look for.    If it's a stranger or girl in a bar, you should look for the following:    Hair twirling (it sounds like something a teenager would do, but we do it)    Staring then looking away. Bet you've heard that before.    If she gets up and walks by you without need. Or makes extra trips to the bathroom.    If she giggles alot or looks at you funny.    If she looks perplexed, she's trying to figure you out.    Sorry I couldn't be of much help, but it really just depends on who you're talking about.    If you have more details, you can email me. I'm more than happy to help(:
0AYPgUQIaa	A healthy sexual life is the basic of a good relationship. If you find out after the marriage that you don't match with your husband in bed, it could lead to a divorce.  Your boyfriend is right, good sex just makes the bond between the couple stronger.|`|USsDzaIsaa	I don't necessarily agree with your views...but I DO agree with your right to have them.  If you do what your boyfriend says and go against your ideals, then you very well may regret it.  This could ultimately ruin your relationship anyway.    It's probably most important that you meet a guy who shares your ideology.  Only then can you have a strong relationship.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Please wait until you are 18, so your BF won't get busted for statuary rape. After that, I'd suggest trying sex with the BF, just for the experience. I don't want a sex partner that does not know what to do or what to expect. Virginity is over ratted. Who, in their right mind would commit to something as serious as marriage, if you didn't know if you were compatible with your partner. Experience is a positive thing.Please remember to use a condom. Always!!!! I have dead friends that didn't remember. YOU put it on, just to be sure. He'll love it.|`|Umsj08pnaa	If you're asking strangers on the Internet you obviously aren't ready for sex.|`|cjnBs0h6aa	Honey, I know you dont want to hear this but its true. Guys in high school usually only want one thing-sex. Im not saying he doesnt love you Im sure he does, but if he does he wouldnt want you to compromise your morals. Saying your too beautiful not to have sex, is a good line but its a joke. He wants to have sex with you and is willing to do anything to get it or say anything. Especially when those arent his morals he doesnt care if you break them or not because thats not a problem of his, he is only thinking of himself when he tells you those things. 4 months may seem like a long time to date, but tis really not especially when your so young. You will regret having sex with him if you do and then you break up later, for many reasons. He'll tell his friends you slept with him so other people will know and then you will have to explain to future boyfriends or your husband (who might have been waiting on you) that you lost your virginity to someone you wish you were never with. Relationships arent a guarantee, you feel happy now but imagine if you slept with him then found out he cheated on you and you dump him. You'd regret it. Don't break your morals, I promise its hard now not to but you will be so happy in the future that you didnt and your husband will think it was sweet you waited, he might even have been waiting too. Good luck in your decisions!|`|4jx4wAhgaa	Normally when you say you wanna have sex with your partner, it means that you and your partner are willing to take responsibility! And this responsibility normally comes from a more matured person and that is why you should only have sex after your marriage! Be patient! You will have the right moment when the time comes! Don't regret it! =D|`|ON84EQaBaa	I think you should wait...its not what its chalked up to be.  you save yourself don't let no one talk you in to something you're no sure about, some guys just want to say they were the first. It would be good to marry a virgin guy that way the two of you can experince love making together.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	If you want to do it, do it. If you don't want to do it, then don't. Just decide and stick by your decision. Don't think you are any better or worse than anyone else for having made it. Morals are subjective to the individual and only you can decide what is and is not moral for you.|`|C3yE261uaa	If I were you I wouldn't cause like you I'm keeping it till marriage|`|rBAfSiKhaa	no wait tell marriage because that will make it more Special and Intimate for your hubby!|`|ewixOpyFaa	okay im a guy with morals too, but i dun believe in abstinence. If u wanna do it, go for it but if u believe in sex after marriage i have alot of respect for u.  for the bf u currently got, if hes pressuring u into having sex and u told him u wanna wait for marriage tell him to find sum1 else other wise if u decide to ditch your morals i still respect that as long as its with a person u really love|`|3PlT64Yuaa	If you're not religious about sex, feel free to have sex before marriage, just don't be stupid.    Unless you want to casually date and do one-night stands, which I don't see you doing judging from your question, have sex with your boyfriend if sex isn't what your relationship is centered around. If you boyfriend is just with you for sex, then don't give it to him. You would be an object in that case. If sex is something that is secondary to caring and supporting each other in your relationship, then by all means, go for it.    But, when you said that your boyfriend already had sex and that your friend says you're beautiful, to me, it seems that your boyfriend is just with you for sex. He's in high school, and if he's already had sex at the high school age, he's only going to be in relationships for sex for the rest of high school, and possibly even college. He has nothing to lose, and everything to gain.    Ask your boyfriend if he could go without sex for the duration of the relationship, and see how he reacts. Use your best judgment.|`|SLMxAJ2Vaa	:::Rilee... has a point. If I was married to you and you were a virgin...I'd love you soo much more. I'm a virgin too.    Why do girl's from the UK always have these amazing personalities (i'm referring to :::Rilee...)|`|hubrdh3Vaa	There is no reason to wait until marriage.  If you are going to pledge to spend the rest of your life with someone, don't you think you should make sure that the two of you are sexually compatible?  Do you think a man wants to have to show his new wife what to do, or do you think he might prefer for her to know what she is doing?|`|g5Orpmnpaa	As a christian you should wait until ur married. Its hard. I know its hard because My gf and I struggle with that same topic. We want to do it but we know we cant... It hurts because you know u want to do it with the person u love but cant... I know u want it. I know it u want to just do it and have fun, but in the end u will regret it, because he might not be the one. You might never get married to him. You said you want to wait until marriage. Well think about it now. You have a decision to make now. You can either do it now. and just be like everyone else. Or you can wait until marriage. Dont you want to give it to ur husband the person u love and wants to be close to u. Or you want to just throw it at someone that prob will leave u soon after u have sex. I know you want to have sex but, you seem like a good girl, so I think even though u want it , u know its wrong. Think about it what if u guys break up? Then u go out with another guy and get married, but on ur honeymoon you cant give him ur virginty. Why? Because you choice to have it with someone that all he wanted was sex and he leaves you. Leaving you alone and with shame, because you cant take it once u do it. Think about it PLEASE  THINK ABOUT IT! What if a guy right now has the same idea as u to wait until to get married to have sex. Even he wants it, even though he struggles with it. What if u find him and he waited but u didnt? You know how much shame that would bring u? To know that u didnt wait and gave ur virginity while he waited. You would feel like dirt. You said not to treat u like a little high school girl. Well ok Im being straight with you. You do it now have fun that only last like the average people that have sex last around 5-10 mins. That 5-10 mins might feel good but right after that u r going to have shame ur whole life. You cant tell ur kids o dont have sex until ur married because u did. So ur kids r prob going to say well she says to not do it but she did it so why cant I? Ok thats if you want to do it now. Now think about this really hard please!!! If you wait until ur married, you know ur husband will be grateful for you to give your virginity to him. That tell him that you waited a long time just to give it to him. It shows a lot of love. Also you can school ur kids about not having sex before marriage because u didnt do it. Your setting urself as a example to them and to others.     Now it sounds like this bf of ur doesnt seem to care about when u have kids. About o what will our kids think? Please dont think Im talking trash about ur bf. I am not and please dont think I am. Its just that sex is really something for marriage people. I mean Does it sound ok for a husband and wife to have sex? Yeah it sounds ok because they r married. Now what about a bf and a gf? I dont think. Tell ur mom and dad right now u want to have sex and see what they will say. I would think they would be angry at u. Now tell ur parents ur having sex while ur married. Your parents prob wont care in fact they would prob think its weird for u too tell them what ur doing in the bedroom. So please dont do it. Please dont. Give ur virginty to the man you love ur husband.
bCaFwm2Naa	hi my name is garrett im definitelly not an expert but i really feel for you i guess im a lil different of a case then most guys cuz i was raised by alot of females so im not really big into playing games but from my opinion first off if i was you i would tell him that you have something planned and then dont tell him what it is and then all day long you have plenty of time to think long and hard of somethings to do with him like maybe take him out and while hes out and away from things that might make him get distracted like by being at home, start to just talk to him ask him how he feels.....ask him what hes thinking about.....what he thinks about when he thinks about you.......how much in love is he with you.......you get the picture just spend all day with him to really get him so he cant think of nothing else but you and you only!!!   hopefully this will work cuz being only 28 i screwed up alot of relationships that i deeply regret and wish i could take back but all i know is that one day when i do meet miss right im definitelly gonna make sure she knows that shes the sun in solar system!!! and NOTHING else is better then her!!!!  cuz a good woman is very very hard to come by these days   just make sure he realizes that      good luck    garrett|`|X4Owk0xTaa	It's that bloody warcraft game, I swear I have heard the most insane cases where people have not been able to go about their simply, daily routines because the game is so addictive. I think you need to talk to him about it and be gentle but make it clear that he is spending more time on a game than he is with the real world, let alone his very own lover. If you really really are fed up, there's no need to be subtle about it and do something before your relationship breaks down due to a game.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	From experience with that game it super addicting!!!! I was the same way i didnt leave, i stayed up all night, sleep all day, and got fired from my job! IT took some serious like losing my job for me to realize a game wasnt worth it!

kpi69PHWaa	Dreams are just your brain's interpretation of the random firings of your neurons through your sleep cycle. Your brain's interpretation will be influenced by what you're recently seen or thought about. You might be worried about him cheating on you, you could be thinking about some other guy you knew who cheated on someone and your brain just mashed it together with thinking about your boyfriend. If you're not jealous or worried, just disregard the dreams. If you are, then talk to your boyfriend about what's concerning you.|`|VIDh3oUVaa	all those dreams mean that ur a afraid of him wont love u anymore etc.. or afraid of losing him.. u should talk very intimately with him and get yourself to know that both love eachother a lot and wont ever cheat|`|EMYlCPfuaa	yes often what ou dream is waht you fear. maybe you shoyuld takl with him so some of your fears cn be dispelled. before you go to sleep see the good times you have with him and then see what your dreams come up with. and when you dream, keep a journaland pen beside the bed so you can write down what yyou see and most of all what you feel.. your gut emothionss will tell yu most of what you need to kwno|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Didn't you just post this a day ago???|`|c8nRUYrcaa	My mum tells me all these meanings about dreams, and hand lines n stuff (WHICH IS ACTUALLY TRUE!!!

Also, its because you've been thinking about him all the time and that subject might come up once in a while into your head.

OR maybe you love him a lot and you are just afraid of loosing him.|`|TuRxaiZIaa	I think that's actually a good thing.  You are upset at the thought that he may cheat on you.  You may be a little insecure and think he is too good for you.  WHich is absolutely not true!  Remember he is with you..    If i were you i would go to a dj event and see what it's like.  i think you may find you have nothing to worry about and if he is a sleaze you don't need that kind of person in your life.    Good luck and remember dreams rarely mean what you think.  ie dying dreams do not mean your dying etc|`|An8rT0WMaa	unless you have a reason to think hes cheating, its just being paranoid... ive done it too lol|`|X1utg6wfaa	Dreams are not real my dear.  They are just something that keep us going.  If you have something on mind as you go to sleep, it obviously remains on you mind and comes as a dream.

There are lots of theories though:    -Dreams happen for no reason at all. Your brain just ticks over while you're asleep and random things come out, buy they don't mean anything.    -Dreams express emotions you've been bottling up and work out problems for you - or at least try to.    -Dreams are the gods speaking to you. Many ancient people believed that the answers to their questions would come to them in a dream, especially on the night before something important, like a battle.    -The famous psychoanalyst Sigmud Freud thought that dreams are an expression of what we secretly wish for, even if we pretend we don't, and they're full of symbols with hidden meanings."      Personally, dreams are just dreams. I don't take them too seriously, and I don't believe they're a sign that something bad is going to happen.    I wouldn't worry, but according to the theories mentioned above you might be having these nightmares because of your doubts. You're doubting your boyfriend, you think he's cheating on you, so you'll dream about it.     You should continue loving your boyfriend, and don't let something as trivial as nightmares (which happens to everyone) get in the way of a potential long-term relationship.     Hope I helped, and best of luck to you and your boyfriend.
HVE6igl8aa	Well thru experience i found out NO PICK UP LINES. They suck. Sit next 2 her if you can and if she looks at  you smile. Talk to her and tell her good jokes. Girls love that|`|l9MPAp4xaa	Sit next to her during class and ask her a question about an assignment or something saying that you were late or weren't there that day. Basically, start off by talking about that class and asking her what other classes she's taking. If she's nice to you, then proceed to getting personal conversation.
2dke6ChJaa	could be a reason he doesnt want to share that is making him act funny, if your best friends just ask him why he doesnt wana hang out, just be direct but friendly and accept whatever he says.    p.s.s sounds like someone wants to be more than friends???? you sound very upset, ask yourself why.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	Tell him how you feel if he is a friend worth having he will understand your feelings.|`|K5ezVimbaa	no. its fair what you're saying.  he probably has a reason.|`|nA97uWdyaa	I think he just doesn't realize how much it would mean to you. Guys can be a little dense sometimes when it comes to other people's feelings because men don't usually open up to each other in our friendships with other guys. I think you should tell him about what you told us, in a non-confrontational way, and ask him if he is still willing to be the friend to you that he was before.
uQ9SXDmaaa	oh sweety, thats very sad.    but quite honestly, you need to tell him. even if you make the effort, guys are pretty strange sometimes.    he could even think you're ignoring him.    you need to say something. and if it persists,    end it. try being friends, but this is my saying:    dont make somebody a priority if they're only gonna make you an option.    hope i helped. and i hope it works out|`|RvmYqQtRaa	He knows the relationship can't go any deeper so he's no longer trying to maintain it knowing it's as far it will ever go. Same thing happened to me except with a woman of course.|`|SbsB0bwEaa	hes prolly not interested in you. it sucks but it has happened to all of us.|`|CqpK9LC1aa	I think that your mutual conclusion to staying as friends may have hurt him deeply.   And he's probably lashing back at you by acting like this. Have you confronted him about it? if not, I would get on it right away.     He's hurting, and really bad, it seems.       He likes you, hun, more than as a friend.|`|S4gKPOBOaa	some friend get a real friend.|`|Mj0BA4Yvaa	Look, it's basically like this. For guys, friends are people we hang out with if we have the time to kill.  Friendship is a non-emotional relationship.  He's busy right now, and you are not his girlfriend.  You are his friend.  So suck it up, give him space and when he's got some spare time he'll give you a call.      If you actually want to keep him as a friend - don't go all emotional on him.  That's a friendship killer.|`|QQbtCLAkaa	look at it this way: at the rate things are going, nothing will go any further (it sounds like) so you have nothing to lose by pushing harder for him.  If you stand idly by and let life take it's course, it sounds like he'll drift away from you.  The worst-case scenario is that it makes things awkward and he stops talking to you.  Is that so much worse than having him not interested and just talking to you for the sake of making conversation, forcing you to move on anyway?  Are you content with just having your relationship at this level?  Maybe it's worth the risk...|`|CBKpuMjDaa	This is typical of a guy who gets into a relationship with a girl.  regular girl FRIENDS don't matter.  no matter how close you thought you were. it hurts but they dont care.|`|gM0RMviAaa	the best thing you can do is try to talk to him and see what ne says and if you think he is lying then play his game next time he wants to hang just say u have plans u cant change|`|l2nkHFfFaa	this is true love|`|q2mSoCZTaa	he probably has a girlfriend and doesn't want hanging out with you interfere with him spending time with his girlfriend.|`|7XRL01G1aa	Yeah it sucks but maybe you're being a bit clingy. If he is trying to avoid you just get on with your life & find some other people. Treat him with the same disregard he treats you & he will realize how it feels & he miss being your friend. if he needs space, give it to him, sometimes that is what being a friend is all about.   or maybe he's on drugs...  or maybe he has changed and is not nice anymore, in either case, if he is nasty to you - who cares?|`|VScRdzJKaa	Tell him how you feel. He has no idea that he's made you upset, and I doubt he would intentionally hurt you. If he still talks to you then you matter to him.   It's not immature, you're standing up for yourself.|`|MVSfrq1Naa	I am touched by your story. I once had a best friend like this also. Over the years and experiences, we both went through changes. Maybe something has happened, and he isn't sure whether you will accept him anymore, or maybe he is just thinking about whatever he feels for you.  Guys occasionally take space to examine how they feel about certain things (especially if they are smart and cautious).    One thing I am sure of, though. You need to tell him how you feel. You need to make sure he knows that he is important to you. Give him some space if he needs it but don't act like you don't care.    Anyway, good luck with this - hope to hear what happens.|`|ZDQIRll0aa	Well u know if u guys don't talk that much and if it seems like he doesn't want to talk to u nor spend some time with u just come up to him and surprise him. Ask him what's up and why is he doing that. That has happened to me before but I came up to him and asked him why is he like that. If he really cares about you as your best friend, he will talk to you and tell you why. Maybe for some reason he's just too tired or something.     Well I hope this helps! :)    ~Nina
d68fcba8d2d9be865acddf103d499bd1aa	It is hard to change schools and make friends with kids that all know each other, so hang in there.    Groups will change again and again over the years so be patient.  The friends you have now and that you see others with will change in every grade.      Stop trying.  There are many times that we want to try to fit in and actually turn people away because of it.  If you really get to know what you like and what you don't like and become really comfortable with who you are and learn to like your company, you will do so much better in life anyway and will start to attract good people to you.    If you are comfortable with you when you are alone and you like yourself and know yourself, you will be surprised how fast your situation will turn around.    Be the best you, you can be, for YOU, and your rewards will come.|`|75SSAFsPaa	1 you seem to be trying too hard when a guy or girl comes off needy people run like the wind. 2 find something that you really like to do and join a youth group that likes to do that also suggestions swimming ,crafts,music(Learn to play a instrument)My boyfriends kids got into music and his son wows the girls wit his talents.you will be doing two things one you will be making yourself a more interesting person and two you will be building confidence and not coming off so PLEASE BE MY FRIEND.do you like to cook? dance? and nobody messes with a beautiful young girl who has gotten into shape with martial arts and none will snub her if her boyfriend she met in class doesn't"t like it.HAVE FUN FRIENDS COME WHEN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING SO HARD|`|QgiTgc6paa	Don't worry about them it's their loss, but look at it this way, at school you will get SO much more work done!

Don't worry about it.|`|AA10381723	I am sure someone will come around and i can understand what you are going through when i was in school something like that happend to me|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	Sorry, I thought this might be former President Bush|`|t7K7ETfgaa	go to a public school for highschool. seriously, you meet SO many different kinds of people.  you can join a bunch of different clubs or groups, whatever interests you and that way you'll meet people who share the same interests and aren't snarky stuck up jerks all in the same clique.  and for the most part, teachers are really good and sometimes cool. so try to convince your parents to let you go
a123cdea49e8f502487a7c5b0eeb55a0aa	Yes I sometimes enjoy being topless usually when I'm home alone and have gotten out of the shower or when i'm with my boyfriend.  I have gone topless drunk before in front of guy friends.  BIG MISTAKE! lol|`|Umsj08pnaa	No. It's very uncomfortable for me to go around without a bra. Shirtless is fine, but I'd have to wear a bra, unless we were in bed...|`|EsnFmcMFaa	of course girls like begin topless  they dont have to wear a bra  do u know how much wearing a bra is such an inconvenience to them|`|6boH5X5Baa	i find it alright to be topless but only around my boyfrined i wouldn't be comfortable around my friends that are guys when i'm topless but i have to admit we played truth or dare and i have flaashed infront of guys guess it wasn't that bad either|`|KBnhvH0maa	It honestly depends how conscious you are about yourself.. But no.. even if I was very confident about my body, I still wouldn't go in front of a guy friend topless! That would be extremely awkward for me and for him!    I'd rather be pure... so no impure relationships before marriage.. and that includes going topless. =D|`|4jx4wAhgaa	Seriously, I don't enjoy going topless! But if its in front of your future husband, then its ok! But just going topless in front of a guy friend, that's totally out of the question!=D|`|WNskx1JGaa	No, I dont like being topless. Id rather keep my bra on and have my shirt off.    No, I would never be topless in front of a guy friend.

Have confidence! Hope it all goes well; and thanks for answering my question too =D
e6rveQ8qaa	As his girlfriend you should respect his space and give him his friend time. However, if he's hanging out with them to the point where you find yourself alone more than half the time then there's a problem...    And as for your situation, I don't think you should force yourself to assimilate into his group of friends. I say that you just find as many opportunities you can to hang out with him and his friends and just gradually warm up to them :)    Trust me, when you're a constant presence in a group of people you'll eventually become part of the group! One thing though!...Don't be too persistent with hanging out with your BF and his friends all the time because if you're always with them they'll start being annoyed of you...    Like I said before..give him his space but when you get an opportunity to kick it with his group then go for it!|`|NEglsYQAaa	tell your man ur uncomfortable standing there lookin like a foo. and you want to spend time with him not his friends you don't know|`|H9G8y1acaa	If it's a group of dudes, then you won't have any problems. If there are girls in this group it may be a little more difficult. I find it to be true that girls just don't get along to well with other girls too well. Just don't be all jealous of his friends because they will know if you are.|`|50pKPrHxaa	Have you ever hang out with this group? have you experienced the "just stand there" with that group? you may never know until you do so. Just be friendly just like how you deal with new acquaintances. Smile and hear out what they have to say during conversations and give your opinions regarding these topics.     Goodluck.|`|258mrT2Paa	try saying are you up for a threesome later, im sure you will be the centre of attention in the group, both with boys and girls.|`|4b273ea1bcd18de731e487c9a11bbc44aa	Just feed off of them, see what they are saying and add in your opinion.  Be nice and try to be a little funny without hurting anyones feelings.|`|pBMfANkwaa	oo,,, i know wat u mean,, ive had this!  well i kinda thought my bfs group were really daunting n all that,, but once i got invited 2 a party and he was there with his group so i was forced 2 make conversation,,, i just walked up to them gave them a smile and introduced myself all asked how they were! it'll work fine  just be smiley!!  good luck Hun,,|`|ZVngHOBTaa	ive been in similar situation  i sorta held my bf (you know so it looked natural) and then everyone is already chatting so just join in when you can you don't need to be the one to make the convo|`|jSppTOqaaa	"heyy i'm _____"    & if there the funny type .. they'll comment it and you can start a flowing conversation.    make sure you laugh at the rright time.. BE YOURSELF :] feel comfortable. make jokes.|`|9ybVTCcnaa	I would say "Hi! I like cake" and smile|`|QGQV9hvLaa	well try and talk to your boyfriend before hand and ask him a little about his group so when you get there you can be like so i heard you like to.... thats interesting. Tell your BF that you want to be friends with his friends but you feel a little awkward im sure he'll understand and help you ease into the situation.|`|HF9v91XPaa	Use the old Brian Regan standard and just walk up and say "I don't know what you're talking about, may I still stand here please?" In a really awkward voice.
Wrf5orAuaa	Cummin' is an orgasm.  The main thing for giving your g/f orgasms is the contact with her clitoris during sex. Go deep and stay there, grinding her clit with your pubic bone and she'll be there in a flash. You can also stimulate it with your fingers.  Oral is a good entr, to get her to orgasm as long as it's done right.  Doggy style can stimulate her clit from the inside and many women get off very well with this position.|`|258mrT2Paa	ask me around and watch and learn.|`|it7C6nFSaa	lick her pu*sy and fing`er her|`|ThfHrcc4aa	Well if she is having cumming she must have had her orgasm.|`|eMtH8IAwaa	oral works. just take your time.|`|66UQd2Gyaa	i was under the impression "cummin" and orgasm were the same thing...line up your pelvis with hers....it may not feel as good to you but itll make her arrive|`|c5cd0335ee42a5ea6e90bf0c236232e4aa	the answer is right with you, just communicate with her and be open tell her all that you feel and explain to her that she needs to tell you to, remember that most relationships break because of lack of communication, so be nice and talk things through with her and see the difference in your relationship.|`|uhL6jzhQaa	Not all women are capable of er that. It isn't always their partners. ( just so you know)  As mentioned before,touching and caressing could play a key role in arousing her to that point. All women are different, so experiment. :3  Don't give up!|`|6DB0MckAaa	Cumming and an orgasm are not the same thing AT ALL.    A girl always cums, or gets wet when she feels aroused.    An orgasm is feeling so weak, to the point where you don't feel capable of taking anymore... and that's when she tells you to stop.    I've faked it a lot of times with my last ex.  I had to teach him how to touch me, and it worked.  Ask her for suggestions. Don't be embarrassed.    Why be embarrassed? You guys are already both naked, can it get more embarrassing than that?(inside joke)|`|xkgcYeXPaa	random guy you'll probably just call me to take care of it!|`|515Tr0Kmaa	Usually them saying they are cumming means that they are having an orgasm.  But as far as tips go I would say that its different from girl to girl, some girls just can't get there with intercourse, those ones need you to go down on them.  While some girls can't stand having your tongue down there since they're too sensitive.      In other words you should probably try asking her and letting her know that YOU enjoy making HER happy.|`|W7ZfFxTxaa	auditory effects work to much for women,tell her how much you love her during sex,how she is pretty beside every woman has her own sensitive point which you must find it by yourself or by asking her  you must hit the point man|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	you tease the hell out of her, by making her look at you lick her. but never really touching her. she'll get so wet and desperate that she'll shove your face into her crotch|`|1poSSvTdaa	If she thinks she is cumming, then she is having an orgasm. If I were you I would get a book about it, as you don't know enough.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	call me ial get the job done right|`|Zki0DuLWaa	Oral sex|`|nCrbKAuzaa	carressing her is enough. kissing her on the neck, touching her sensitive organs (you know what i mean) kissing her with love. wow! that will be great.
szVvf7Nkaa	No, that does not make you a bad person. The best part to this is  the day when you woke up and the day you were able to walk out.|`|VygBNA0Waa	no its not bad you know its not working so why waste one more week there   good on you for having the guts to do it|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Does that make you a bad 'what'?  A bad person, a bad companion, a bad husband/wife, a bad partner?    Sounds like "you" didn't use your brain while dating this other person and perhaps were "in lust", not "in love".    Gut feeling?  I don't understand your writing that comment.  Gut feeling about what?|`|YdUqwCpOaa	Most of the time we think that we got the right person to love but that should not make any one sad. Forget the incident and search for another.|`|Jl26y7fcaa	dont just wake up and walk out-try to understand all the perspectives , sharp and then cut,if cut directly it will hurt both of u,talk and go away.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	No. You are not "bad" for that.    You have every right - and a responsibility to yourself - to be with whomever you want. You are allowed to have standards which are important to you. Maintain them, go with your gut..... and leave.    Period.
xmhOrjQLaa	A thirteen year old girl need not be concerned with pecuniary matters, especially if her parents are able-bodied and willing to support their family. It simply isn't your responsibility to be the bread winner. It is very hard when times get tough and there doesn't seem to be enough money to pay all the bills and keep everyone fed, etc. I suffered through similar circumstances when I was growing up, so I feel for you. But these are the times when your family will grow the closest. You will all have suffered through the same hardships together, and shared hardships tend to bond people together in a very strong way. So my advice to you is to not worry about trying to fix a problem which you may well be ill-equipped to handle in the first place. Study hard? Absolutely! That won't fix your current situation, but it will definitely help to better your future. You seem to be bright, and I wish you and your family all the best for a better future.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hon. it is not yr responsibility @ 13 to help with yr parents financial issues.  Continue on with yr studies & try & make home life more comfortable by just being yourself.   Take care|`|AA10506024	Honey.. U keep on being who you are ...

5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	If you have to use words like "lure" you should probably think about the reason you want him back.

v3e6NDYbaa	How could you have a degree in psychology and be asking such a dumb question?  No chick likes a guy for having any degree.  Period.    They will like you because you are foreign and therefore exotic.  But try not to be such a dumb ***.|`|8wi2X5sSaa	i dont mind because it would be sweet if u know the girl's minds and what would make them happy and stuff. im actually thinking of becoming a pshychologist one day.|`|CtNs7EAsaa	i think its hard to make assumptions upon an entire nation. i bet you will meet all kinds of girls each different then the other. just like here! lol|`|hChy7BAPaa	haha awesome.  hey...i analyze all the time. it's how us psychologysts are. i'm sure they'd love a guy with a bachelors in psychology. good luck/fun there man!|`|gIaQ7Y4oaa	Do puerto rican chicks like guys with a bachelors in philosophy? How does a bachelors in psychology mix in to asian chicks? Wouldnt this be aimed to women in general? i cant believe you made it through college personally...oh well, miracles happen.|`|3PlT64Yuaa	I don't think having a bachelor's in psych will make you more desirable, but it couldn't hurt.     I think you'll be using it more on yourself than on the girls though. In Asia, you'll have to analyze all of your actions to avoid moves that are socially unacceptable, no matter how acceptable they are in the West.
wPABw3U0aa	ugh sounds like a messed up situation. honestly dont ditch him just because he does pot. i dont believe in leaving friends becasue they start to do drugs. alot of times thats when they NEED YOU the most. try talking to him about it. tell him you really dont like the idea of him doing pot. granted tho doing pot isnt THAT BAD. i mean i dont believe in doing any drugs at all but its not like hes doing cocaine or acid. that would be MUCH WORSE. but pot is not good either. try talking to him and tell him you think hes MUCH BETTER than that. hes probably doing it because he misses his ex gf or that he has alot of personal issues going on in his life that hes trying to escape. when people turn to drugs theyre usually having a hard time and try to escape. just be there to help him. dont leave him. hell appreciate you caring for him and it could proabbly bring you two even closer. Always try to help your friends in time of need. Even if he gets mad at you for telling him to stop continue to be his friend. he might get over it and realize your right.|`|XZSp2ORPaa	When your out with him does he smoke it? or smell like it? Does he drive? if so look around his car for papers, roaches, anything that would give you an idea that hes doin it. If so talk to him but dont tell him that you know, tell him " im so against drugs" and see his response. The other girl, is she with "your guy"? If so then let them b, their only together for the pot, theres no connection they just want someone to smoke with and it will get real old soon.|`|Gph0c0kbaa	smoking pot isnt equal to doing drugs. pot is grass. if i smoked an dandylion would you call me a druggie?|`|AbcnySYkaa	Drugs shouldn't control whether or not your friends with a person, it may be a good or bad habit to those who look on it, but in the end they are still the same person, but now with a goofy personality also|`|JZkCVHJAaa	i personally don't date the drug types, usually means trouble some where but that still doesn't mean he's not a good guy and i would let his ex girlfriend thing settle before making a move plus that will give you more time to get to know him|`|0VBESmFQaa	well for **** sakes don't down him for smoking a few joints, And he still loves his ex so don't worry you probably does not like you anyway|`|IhF2zT5maa	Good for him for smoking the leaf.

How do you know they haven't been smoking it together already?|`|a0BHaB9paa	That is a very bad road to go down. While his "bad boy" appeal may look good now, it can lead only to dangerous consequences later. My advice, don't be the girl who tries to "set him straight". There are probably much better (and much more gentlemanly) boys right in front of you, you just have to start looking.    oh and P.S.

6GUpUXoXaa	Just because it's your longest relationship doesn't mean itll be your only relationship.  if you aren't ready to be in love then you aren't ready... maybe shell never be the one that you fall in love with ... if shes trying to push you to love her when you don't then it's not going to be a good relationship in the long run.  If she really wants to break up with you because you don't want to lie to her then so be it.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Love can take a long time.  I knew around eight months in, and it was scary, lol.  Some people take longer than eight months; maybe you do.    The bottom line is, you don't want this relationship to move that fast (and eight months is WAY too soon to be moving in together).  Because of that, I don't think you're in love with her and I think you should just let her do her thing while you're gone.    When you're in love, you'll know.  It's totally cliche, but it is the truest thing I've ever heard.|`|dmqVzSZKaa	8 months is not that long. you will find other people|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	Get the thumb out of your @$$, if you have to ask somebody what love is than that's probably why there is so much confusion in this relationship.
xHKRGEg4aa	Loving a man in the military is always difficult because you never know what to expect. My fiance is in the marines & he goes to Iraq next month. Its hard being with someone that you never get to see, because you feel like you miss out on a lot of things. You cant go out with your boyfriend on friday night, you can't do normal things that normal couples get to do, because of the distance. But at the same time, i wouldnt trade my fiance for anything in the world. Hes the best thing to ever happen to me. & even though I dont get to be with him as often as I like, the little times I do get to see him make up for everything.  Its a personal choice, if your relatively young, I'd tell him to chill & just be friends, that way you still get to go out & so does he. & when he comes home, you guys can see how things work out.  good luck  
acWyJ3t0aa	Jasmine , you are absolutely correct if you are talking about young guys . About 90% of youg guys think with their small head and it ain't the one on their shoulders , rather it is the one between their legs and they want it to get out and used as much as possible and they will lie or whatever they need to say to you to get into your panties and then they will leave you high and dry for their next conquest .|`|xUCXXb73aa	we don't,we want them to hold and stand side by side together|`|rd5468H1aa	Oh my god. Not all of us are like that. Obviously you haven't had enough experience with guys if you want to assume that.|`|XLtDhidJaa	she didn't say every guy. In her defence.      I can't really answer this question but I can give some advice on how to dodge the bad guys.  If the first thing you offer a man is sex then that is all he is going to really want from you.  The saying "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" comes into play here.  Offer a friendship, a relationship & a mate instead of someone to have sex with.    Find new guy friends if all of your guy mates want sex from you.  maybe you're just really good looking?  lol|`|rg5AlVkYaa	The mind is a terrible thing to waste. Show the man you are with that you have one. If he is worth your time- he'll respect your mind. Sex/physical attraction is what starts a relationship- it's not the grand scheme of life. It's the start to intimacy... and just the start to it.    Intimacy involves sex- talking- touching- sharing concepts- sharing future dreams, sharing the past and the present. Talk about money- likes- dislikes. Sex is there, hopefully your partner fulfills your needs as you do his. If the needs of either are strictly sexual then it is too shallow to last. Bring the rest into the equation and you are going somewhere good.|`|zGhDt3dpaa	every man has sexual desires...but that doesn't mean EVERY man wants only sex. I know i don't. Sex is great but it is defiantly not everything i want from a woman|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	You're hanging around with the wrong guys.  I suggest you go find some cute nerds.  Nerdy guys are a lot of fun to hang out with and they have more on their minds than just sex.
L5Jahdg8aa	Go up to her ask for her name. The trick is to find a common interest interest that you both have its usually easier if you are in the same classes because then you can bond about assignments and bad teachers, but since you aren't you can ask her what classes she does take. Then after that you can ask her about her general interests and try find ANYTHING that is at least remotely similar to yourself so you can continue the conversation without it being awkward.|`|nfn01Xsfaa	ya... i think find a time to ask her for her name. or ask her firend what her name is.    do u like her or interested in her? is that why u feel awkward?    if she says hi, then say hi back.. next time u see her first.. UU say hi first and walk over to her. ask her what class she has or something.  or pokke her and tickle her. lol.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	Hi I'm _________, whats your name? How are you?  How was your week? Are you doing anything nice for your weekend? Start the convo with something like that.|`|O9jrkjgraa	Ask for her name....|`|UYTdVcDkaa	Introduce yourself.  If she replies with her name, ask her what classes she's taking.  If she doesn't give you her name, she is ridiculing you behind your back and must be dealt with in a harsh manner.
VTlilFu9aa	its possible but you are not likely to stay together with this person beyond junior high much less high school|`|VBdXray0aa	It is called puppy love.    Real love comes from maturity and knowledge of becoming adults and the plans over the years.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	no, not real lasting love.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	talking about maturity...no|`|wJstSw9Daa	No it's not, middle school you're just a kid still. If u think you're in love it's because u have a HUGE, BIG crush on the person, but you're not in love what so ever.|`|uDSXv5Fbaa	well im in love with this guy who has the same name as you in my class|`|qpkNrn8iaa	it might be but usually its when your alot older  u will knw when your in luv u wont have to ask any1 ull jus knw|`|Cqe1hLVGaa	Well, I would think not, if you think you are, you aren't, it's just lust|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	to be technical and make a long story short; yes the chemicals inducing love can be released at that age, but basically, its what people call puppy love.|`|s7UZZbVhaa	no. sorry to break your little heart. you can like someone, but you can't actually feel what love feels like until you are at least 15.|`|1HHn3LZkaa	I wouldn't think so. If I still loved the one I thought I loved then it would be a disaster. Love is not something you look for it's something that happens on accident. Like I said I don't think it's possible sorry.
UYTdVcDkaa	Double check the laws in your state, but I sincerely doubt it.
mFZeEm9paa	THe wildest place, has definitely got to be inside a covered boat on some guys back lawn... Alright let me explain. I also am an adult (28) and practice safe sex. Anyways, my fiance took me to Kentucky to meet his parents, and we were staying with them. They have a small house, and my fiance didn't feel comfortable having sex with them in the house, and they ALWAYS were... Well they live on a lake, so one day, we told them we were going for a walk, got in the golf cart and started to scout out a place to have sex... A covered boat in someones back yard worked for us both.. and no, we were never caught.     We have also done it on our boat in a lake, in a hot tub, in the car on the side of the highway... It is a long drive from Dallas TX to KY!!, on a trampoline in our backyard, on the front porch to one of his old houses, that was on the market but not occupied, at night of course, umm lets see, there was the time we did it leaning up against the car in a parking lot...     When you have gotta have someone, sometimes waiting isn't an option! Have fun with the possibilities and go for it! It is so awesome to have sex in unfamiliar places, and not get caught of course!|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	a guy got me excited to do it in a cinema and in a underground parking lot..we never ended up doing it there..    but i swear one day i will LOL|`|jNUo0tKEaa	At the park, at a beach, in a hotel room, me and my man have done it everywhere:)|`|znmVDYRaaa	outside in random places is fun..  park bench  behind a police station  on the rail road tracks  etc...|`|jZe7InwSaa	At work, during working hours
s5d2VFVQaa	well if i was low on money (which i am) you can always MAKE a romantic dinner you know candles wine and desert. but be realistic life isnt a movie or TV show and be grateful for what you have.|`|mhnSjsTBaa	why don't you try and make it a special night for both of you? You don't necessarily have to go to a 5 star restaurant to make it a memorable day.   Plan a bunch of cheap activities to do all day long or something. Get your favorite take out food, decorate with flowers and candles, watch a favorite movie, go stroll in a park and have a pick nick at night then watch the stars, etc. etc. Just find out what kind of things you can do around town that are cheap and use your imagination. Make this night something enjoyable for the both of you. :)
0RvZ7IkMaa	well it depends on the kind of flirting she does. like, will she find a reason to touch you causally? or always laugh at something you say even if its not that funny? watch the way she acts around other guys and compare it to the way she acts around you. i think if she is 100% single (make sure of that) then do this:  tell her that since you guys are both single and have nothing to do, (for valentines day) go out for coffee or to eat somewhere FOR FUN! its casual but also hinting that you want to spend time with her. she'll love you for making the first move. if it's successful it's time for round two..;)|`|3EM66IWFaa	What ever may be her reaction positive or negative, ask her face to face because I think you are real male.|`|T3TDOoGPaa	find out what she likes and dislikes.do what she likes and aviod doing what she hates.if in any way u could help her at any time do it.it is more impressive if it involves sacrifices on your part for her.foe eg.she is out at night without a jacket and u happen to see her.say u are shivering and let me help u and then give yours.girls rate sacrifices made for them pretty high.since u are on friendly terms ask her if she did mind dining with u on some hotel on valentines day.on that day get some gift ready to be given when u see her like a ring or a dress and a card saying how much u love and care for her in ur own writing.  p.s u could maybe write i love u in blood.it also helps a lot|`|gqD0P4mYaa	Just talk to her and see if she's interested in having a relationship, if you can tell by the way she acts and speaks or flirting, then there might be some connection going on between you and her. The only way you would know is that when she's flirting with you be like: are you flirting with me? and if her reaction tells you to make a move then you should definitely do it! Good Luck!|`|dya8bP7oaa	You should ask her out on a date or two and get to know her a little bit and see if you really like her|`|ITGh9DRvaa	Well, you risk the chance in making things weird at work.... why not start out with a lunch, you'd be surprised at how much you learn in a 1/2 - 1hr lunch. Its not considered a date and you find out if you have a good chance in getting a date with her. If not, you can still maintain the friendship
0RvZ7IkMaa	aww omg no problem! haha    okay well, first of all you'll have no idea if it will last that long or work out. second of all your right, school is important. maybe she's also going to college out of state, or she won't go to college at all (..if so, tell her NOT a good idea budddd) thirdly (is that a word?)  if you choose not to go because of her, are you sure that you guys will be so in love with each other, get married and in 10 years you'll say "thank god, i stayed in this state"? fourthly (?) if you ARE that much in love with each other you'll find a way to make it work. plus you'll have summer and breaks and what not to be with each other. and i your lucky enough she'll end up being in the same state as you! ..but really, don't bet on that one.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	You gotta go to school, man. I'm in college now and I know a lot of friends who have girlfriends back home and make it work. I go to the University of Illinois and one of my friend's girlfriend is back in his hometown in Maryland. I asked him the other day how things were going with them and he said that they were great, that they still talk a lot and although he misses seeing her, they are still love each other like always. If he's made it work with thousands of miles b/t him and his gf, so can you.    I hope things work out and this girl that you like and you end up together but your success in life is dependent upon your college education.|`|lU8ucOpjaa	If something is meant to be it will be.    Go to college, and get an education.  If you guys are meant to be together you will be- college really isn't that big of an obstacle if you guys try and make it work.|`|C28tF09Faa	School. The most important thing ever. If things work out and she cares about you as much, then you two will find a way to work things out, Lots of phone and online conversations and visits whenever you can!  School!!|`|HWAQ29s2aa	well dude if she loves you shell stay with you even if you are apart.go to school and let her know youll be back.good luck.|`|hn3qLpXJaa	take her with you XD !!    hey, if you guys are really that great together, maybe you should stay together and stick through it together :)    then you work together on both your lives how fun aww...    ? ask yourself.|`|GJFKID4Haa	Don't you have college universities in your place?If there is, you can try going college in your place.  If you don't have, I better suggest you should live your place and prioritize your studies. There are a lot of means to communicate with the girl you like if you want to...  Priorities are important and college should be on the top of your list.  Education matters when you look for work.  Work is necessary if you want a financially stable family.  Per se, you can make the girl you like happier, by the choices you made.   And I hope your choice is right.|`|TxsnvnrSaa	READ ME: I KNOW WHAT UR GOING THROUGH.    You think that is hard...Me and my g/f live 14 hours away. We have been dating since March 2008. That's almost a year and i have seen her twice. It sucks big time but if the love is strong enough it will work. We are in love more than ever...and when we see each other...its the best time that we have together because you do everything that you can and really enjoy their company and not take it for granted|`|kMpgMplmaa	Dude girls come and go. Me personally i would try to stay friends with her at least and explain the situation to her. If she great as you say she is, then she'll understand., and you might have a chance with her later.|`|iIPwAWJTaa	the feelings you have for the firl won't last forever but what will last would be the things that you have learn in college and you can also use it for the future because it can lead you to different choices of life like getting a good job and have a nice pay check because you have a degree on something... but if you think you know the meaning of love for the girl it's your choice...|`|AA11547249	Dude COLLEGE.  I came close to ruining my life for this girl i could have sworn I was ment for.  We dated for four years.  She will distract the hell out of you and its so hard but, seriously, you must stick with school at this point. If it was ment to be, then everything will work out.  Plus college is the time of your life when you will meet lots of other girls, maybe even one who is better then your current if you can believe that.  I left who I thought was the girl of my dreams, we were so young, and both did a lot of growing. I was nineteen @ the time.  I'm twenty three now and just PLEASE listen to this. I know its not what you probably want to hear but I am telling you because I went through this same problem.  You must choose school. When you leave for college keep yourself occupied and go out a lot, that will help you get over her.  If it was ment to be, things will work out after the fact.
b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Well, Mizz Perfection, I'd say you like to fish.  For compliments.  Had any bites yet?|`|OeFNGqbzaa	awesome|`|0VBESmFQaa	I think you look great|`|b7c904040c8591e1ed0462db83098f2aaa	You are really pretty. But your screen name makes you seem conceded.|`|WPhADGwEaa	wow you defiantly got some chick-lets!
tU5NJVL3aa	Sorry, kid, but she's just "enjoying your company".  You can continue to hang with her, but expect much more of this until she eventually finds someone that entertains her more.
jmqT5p0Baa	I am sure you dont know his WHOLE story and it sounds to me that he was with someone and probably "having problems" in that relationship so he started talking to you and he is having mixed feelings about what he did and is completely confused and he is still in the middle of a relationship with someone else|`|wtIWal7Waa	My first guess would be that he's had some sort of issue pop up... like maybe with an old flame or ex. You say he's been hurt before, that may be why... Just give him some time and let him know you're there for him, hopefully he'll decide to pursue things with you =) Good luck|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Maybe his wife found out?|`|7VnmPYuXaa	This is so weird, do I know you? Have we dated before?    I can definitely relate to this guy and here is what happend.  You met him on an online dating site, you guys hit it off on the phone.  You met and you still hit it off.  However, he has about 10 other girls that he is juggling at once.  This is what happens on those dating sites, don't get me wrong they are good, but just be prepared for things like this....|`|aBL04eRbaa	I reckon wait it out,   if he doesn't call then it isn't meant to be.   Once it hits, over 2 weeks,   If it is still annoying you,  give him a buzz,  and ask what's going on?   Then let him go,   if he comes back,   then it's up to you,   but don't chase him!  x|`|yzROqTyoaa	yeah,  i hate to say it,  but it sounds to me as though he's got someone else..  i'm sorry.|`|DxZepZg7aa	i see what you mean when you say "i felt weird" but there are so many guys out there that "act" like a gentleman, guys are sneaky that way. if he hasn't texted you yet he probably doesn't care. why dont you text him and ask if everything is okay?   good luck!|`|XZSp2ORPaa	Call him, and take it slow. Ask if you did something wrong. Just reassure him that he should take a chance and your not gona hurt him like the others.|`|bLplapNIaa	He's just not that in to you! If he was it wouldn't take him that long to call back. Move on! There are plenty of other guys out there that will realize a good thing when they see it and won't play games with you!|`|7QYTlHDlaa	there are actually lots of reasons:  1.) maybe he found out that he was not yet ready to have a commitment, and he just want to make sure that before he pursue, he's already ready for everything.  2.) maybe he was guilty of something, that made him stop doing those sweet things towards you.  3.) he wasn't that sure of what his feelings is towards you..  and etc...    the best thing to do. is just to talk to him, call him and clear things out, then if he will still continue to be cold, then fine, don't mind him anymore... atleast you already did your part and no "buts" and " what ifs" in the future... right???  go girl... hence, there's nothing to lose... right???
0fVtHNtmaa	everyone has moods
362adadcf07b8c4be23f083bb0e84126aa	just talk to her, you'll never figure it out unless you try and talk to her|`|b7c904040c8591e1ed0462db83098f2aaa	Good chance she likes you. Talk to her, ask her out. If she has a boyfriend then she'll say no.|`|gduUlcXoaa	Become a good friend of hers. That way you will be not only be able to find out if she has a boyfriend, you also give her an opportunity to become interested in you. After that you can decide whether to make your move.    Good luck!|`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	I would be very careful about dating someone that much younger than you are at this point in your life.  Two years is alot in high school.  Yet to know her without the whole flirting thing going on.  See if you like her for her personality not her looks.      The other option is to just ask her out.  She should let you know right then if she has a boyfriend or not.
mhnSjsTBaa	If it were me, I'd probably feel insecure too. It's awkward and you don't necessarily want to ban him from this friend, but at the same time, you feel really left out...which leaves you a little nervous about the situation. It's perfectly understandable. I would talk to him about it more and explain that even though you know he says he loves you and you're the only one for him, you still feel really out of the loop when it comes to this girl and that because they get along so perfectly, so in turn, are left feeling insecure. Try to work out a solution or compromise with him that will work helping you both feel satisfied. Tell him that it'd probably help to have a little proof once in a while that you're the only one. (like little romantic acts, etc.) Having things like that every once in a while just because he felt like it could probably help you feel much more at ease about it. But don't make him do all the work! Surprise him every once in a while. A good relationship needs to be working hard on both ends :) good luck!|`|vWrpyzQZaa	I didn't even read your entire question. I read the first five sentences. This is not okay!!! Especially if you've never met her. It's so much easier for other girls to steal a guy when they don't know the girlfriend.     In high school, I dated the sweetest guy for years. He never cheated on me. But he did this same thing and the girl totally fell for him and caused a lot of headache. If he loves you, he will respect your wishes and either introduce you guys or redefine their friendship.
mhnSjsTBaa	He probably got really embarrassed because of the situation and smiled at you because he felt bad/was embarrassed. I wouldn't read to much into it.|`|13a87592d282ebeb271d1b3129180295aa	He ether really likes you, or he doesnt like you at all. I wouldnt worry about it though.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	No he didn't want your number  because maybe he didn't find you attractive and he start blushing because he felt embarrassing that's what really happened so don't start thinking he likes you because he doesnt. So don't worry about it just forget it ever happened. Personally that would make me feel dumb.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Because the guy wanted you friends number not yours  get over it already
jmqT5p0Baa	can you tell me what type of music .. rock, country, r&b, etc..??|`|drHEPb1aaa	ummm WTF???
0fVtHNtmaa	Be there for her.|`|DS33Wl4waa	Make sure she doesn't try and stick you with the child support by naming you as the father
QSodlfMraa	when they tell you about them and their ex having sex, it really upsetting.|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	i like it when my boyfriend surprises me, even just coming up behind me and holding me, or offering to cook dinner or something.   i like it when he teases me or jokes around, but at certain times of the month or when im really tired i can find it annoying.   i love it when he kisses me on the cheek or on the forehead, makes me feel special lol. i like it when he buys me a drink and refuses my offer to pay and i like just lying on his bed together and talking.   and i love it when he sends texts for no reason, just 'how was your day' or a goodnight text.     but as for thngs i dont like, i put up with a lot unless im really tired or have pms lol. i dont like it when he doesnt know when to stop with a joke, and i dont like it when he bags out my friends too much...and i hate it when he leaves me to cook and goes to watch tv or something instead, i dont mind cooking, but i like him to be there if i need him for whatever reason.     like you, im 19, and ive been with my boyfriend for close to 3 years, so i hope i can shed some light for you|`|ziiYVYXZaa	heyy,  I am an 18 yr old female planning on moving to LA...lol anyways.....  turn OFFS  -*********  -mamma's boy  -clingy  -jealous  -abusive  -obsessive  -cry baby  -puny  -can't keep his hands off    turn ons:  (for me anyways...I got some weird standards though)    -when a guy is manly, mean-demands attention when he enters a room, confidence, but not cocky, and treats me like i am the only one in the room-ignores everyone and really looks me in my eyes....this is very sexy and really makes me go crazy!    -when he ever so lightly touches my waist from behind carefully and well planned (as if he is just trying to pass) but really this sort of touch sends chills down a girls spine and back!!!!! It really grabs her attention and drives her-well me CRAZY!!!  be subtle but get your point across.....the more subtle you are the more she will want you, as opposed to the obsessive and horny way some guys act.|`|gduUlcXoaa	In a relationship, 'girls' tend to have this insecurity problem. It makes them jealous and paranoid when their boyfriend mentions or hangs out with other girls too much. You can make them feel more 'secure' with just small sentimental words, actions of gifts.    Personally I do like receiving gifts from my boyfriend, but a lot of the time words and actions mean more than an object.     On the other hand, take note that you're not the one acting insecure and over-sensitive. Don't get worked up on little things.    Trying to over-please or acting fake is a big turn-off as well. Meanwhile do NOT act cold or act like you don't care. Act like she's the world to you, while still being yourself.    Hope this helps!|`|cd5f53c73d36b93390a9a9c7e208d325aa	I really only have two major pet peeves when it comes to guys.  Them not having a job, and them not being able to accept me having other guys as friends.    The unemployment thing isn't because I want them to buy me things, its because half the time, I end up being more like their mother than their girlfriend.    The other thing is because my friends are a very important part of my life.  Its okay to feel a little bit jealous, but you can't expect a girl to stop talking to certain people just because of that.  Besides, at the end of the night, she's going home with you anyways.

She said that when she was in high school and early college, she would masturbate just about anywhere.  She didn't usually masturbate all the way to orgasm, but she would get herself worked up.  Places ranged from, bedroom, bathroom, computer desk, car, I think she even said she masturbated at the mall once.

Realize that this was a one time thing and it will never happen again. There's no reason for two other people to suffer so much over a mistake that happened five years ago.|`|f8372c942b97ecd619d9fe6d98b610abaa	There is absolutely no reason to tell your husband, unless you want to end your relationship and not really "work things out."  You've kept it a secret for 5 years.  Why bother to bring it up now?  What will that prove?|`|AA11545997	Why is it, when one feels betrayed or emotionaly hurt, they feel that they have to go out and screw around?  My huband and I broke apart for a while, and I didn't screw around, Why? because 1, I was MARRIED...2, I had my kids to think of.  3..I have NO sympathy for you..NONE.|`|Wy47JwOQaa	Several years ago, I cheated on my wife with an old friend from high school.  The next day I decide that I have to tell her, because SHE deserves to know.  On my way to her house, I call my father on the phone and ask for his advice.  I will never forget that moment, because as my phone started to lose signal, my father was yelling on the other end of the call: "DON'T TELL HER!!  GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!  DON'T DO THIS! YOU'LL REGRET IT FOREVER! IM BEGGING YOU, DO NOT TELL HER."  I knew at that moment I had to tell her.  Its the right thing to do, and she deserves to know.  We broke up that day, but eventually got back together and we are happily married today.  Even if it may hurt him, it is definitely more selfish for you to never tell him.    How did I know in that moment that the advice from my father was the worst advice possible?  Because my father has been married and divorced 3 times...   all of which because he cheated on them.  His advice is clearly off then.    Remember this as you read the answers of everyone else on this question.  :-)    Do the right thing, because Love isn't about you, its about your spouse and your spouse deserves to know.    You'll get it sorted out.  Best of luck.|`|9b4c3cf261f87e8eff03139562cebd19aa	let sleeping dogs lay, do not tell now after 5 years the only thing you will get is divorced|`|w0rWpxd1aa	if you tell him your husband will lose a wife and a friend. forget it ...its to late to tell him know bury it and dont ever let it out.|`|AA10824151	First I suggest you go talk to your bishop or priest or whoever is your spiritual leader. If you don't go to a church then start, if for no other reason than you can resolve this issue. For starters if you just blurt it out you take the chance of doing more harm than good. You could wreck two marriages instead of one. However Your husbands best friend should have known that he stood to lose his best friend and his wife too. The best thing is to talk to a Man of God and let him help you work through this. I don't pretend to know what he will tell you to do but I do know that no matter how it ends then you will be better off for it. Even if he has you tell your husband he will be there for you and help counsel him.|`|slJWqCI5aa	I think you are really going to have to do some soul searching here. Are you willing to handle the consequences of your actions if you tell him? Can you handle the consequences? In the end you may lose your husband and the other couple as friends, are you willing to jeopardize that? Your husband may eventually forgive you and you may be able to work things out. But if it is eating at you this much, you have to tell him no matter what. For your own sanity. Get it out there.|`|GJ3s6g2laa	dont tell him it was once let it be a secret I know u wud b feeling guilty but still it will devastate him and he wont trust you anymore and after u spilling things he will loose two important ppl in his life first you, who is his wife and second his best friend...    Let it be the way you were going and stop thinking about that but be careful in future that you shouldn't repeat the same deed|`|lfQHjp5baa	I think I would tell him in a controlled and neutral setting, like in a counselors office if your seeing one..  If not, I would highly recommend getting one... Trusting will be  a Huge issue after disclosing this bomb shell.  Naturally your friend doesn't want this opened up.   Likewise, no telling how your husband may react, hence the  neutral setting.. Be honest with him.  To me, it is the only way of saving and restoring trust in your marriage.. In my opinion....|`|AA10442322	Don't tell him at all unless you want a total destruction in your relationship and also your best friend's.     Forget it and move on in life.|`|9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	Keep it to yourself... you will crush your husband...|`|91ba808e7cbaa05530f306c80d49a7f9aa	You have asked a tough question, as no matter what you do about it, it will be wrong.    You are dealing with at least four people's lives in this situation, all of whom you could easily hurt or destroy. (If children are involved, it could involve many more than four.)    The only good that could come from your confession of what happened might be some peace of mind for you, but then again, that may not help either.    In thinking about the whole situation, you will all be better off if you keep it to yourself.    Scripturally, we are told in 1 John 1:8 ?If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.? 9 ?If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.? 10 ?If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.    This confession of sin is confessing it to God and seeking His forgiveness, not necessary another person's forgiveness as that is often impossible to get.     Sometimes, we have to consider the amount of hurt we are going to cause someone else before we do something like confessing things like this to other people.     If you would like more help with this, my e mail s open; feel free to contact me.    Greybeard     ?
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	the first breakup is hardest because we have never experienced it before. it    hurts our ego, makes us feel unwanted and unloved. but things do happen for a reason, and yes u will get over it. everything that happens to us shapes our character, and makes us stronger and better able to deal with the many life;s experiences we will have to endure throughout our lives.its a learning experience, don't take it so seriously.|`|dycbDiEmaa	yea, ive defiantly been in the same situation many of times. depression sucks and you just need to focus on yourself right now and let yourself know that its time to MOVE on. after you gain a little bit of confidence, you will start to love yourself and thats when you will be ready for another girl. id like to say, "nothing cures the last one like the next one"  whatever happens is meant to be and life changes and many hearts break so i guess were all just going to have to get used to it, no matter what!  vote for me!|`|cp38lX51aa	Really all God wants us to do is make Babies. SO he created love and hormones for us to do that easilier and by instinct. This is y non-sexual reltionships are pointless. Now if you guys were really in 'love' then you can find away to get her back because it is likely that she is feeling the same way. But if she was dating you only for kicks... Your screwed. Sorry, now what you should do is find another girl and fall in 'love' again. And if you guys were fighting is that really love? Peace|`|slJWqCI5aa	Yes you will get over her. Move on and be happy..if it was meant to be it will be!!!
VIDh3oUVaa	well i would say just enjoy valentines day and make him something really nice and at the end of the day or at the time u want just look into his eyes and tell him.. i love u... he may say i love u too... u say... but i really really love u... and a kiss would be great there or use ur imagination... but u have to tell him like that xD!
n195n9Avaa	Yeah that pic of her isn't cute and she needs to whiten her teeth or something..and take that stupid tongue ring out.    She sounds immature big time and looks it.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Is there proof they're fake? Or that she's making their profiles? I sincerely hope that this isn't true; can you imagine how lonely someone must feel if they think making up people is the only way to being "happy?"    Either way, she's kind of wrong for lying.|`|gduUlcXoaa	Yes, your friend is really desperate. My advice is to make sure she does not know you know that she makes up fake boyfriends. It will hurt her pride a lot and she will be angry with you.    I understand that it's super annoying to have them rant on to you about their imaginary boyfriend, but maybe you should try to help her. As in go match-making. Or making her feel that it is perfectly okay not to have a boyfriend. Something to make her have a higher level of esteem in herself. You are her best friend after all, she should listen to at least half of what you have to say.    Good luck and hope this helps!
m6P9BNWFaa	depends on the girl. i'm pretty quiet, myself, so if i saw a guy i liked i would probably look for some random excuse to talk to him, so she might like you. a more social person would probably just start up a random conversation, you know? but then again she might just want to know what your book is =P|`|CU1WRghVaa	No|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	Yes, this is called an opening line. They want to meet you.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	maybe shes want to know what book it is|`|7FAZYMy3aa	I think she wants to know the book, that's it|`|nfn01Xsfaa	to a girl, that might not be "random". it may be part of her personality. or it may, be that she just wants to talk with u.    if u want to talk with her, then why dont u talk with her?    whether she likes u or not is irrelevant..    its whether u want to talk with her back and continue the convo thats relevant...|`|pX8qJzjIaa	Usually that just means shes trying to find a reason to talk to you
acWyJ3t0aa	Yes it definitely means she is interested in meeting you and finding out more about you . So if you are interested yourself , tell her the name of the book and what it is about and ask her if she reads much and what kinds of books or does she have a special author she likes . Then see where it goes . Who knows what could happen . 46 years ago I walked up to a girl on my high school campus that I did not know and put my arms around her from behind and said " hello doll " and walked off . In Dec. we will be celebrating our 42 wedding anniversary . You never know .|`|VIDh3oUVaa	probably... yes
U22nd6Aaaa	Firefighters generally have a pretty stressful job. Obviously they're going to be driving around the city putting out fires or conducting rescues. It'd be pretty unpredictable.    It really depends on how much he enjoys doing it though. Just be ready to listen to him if he wants to talk and if he needs downtime like just relaxing be ready to let him.    Even though it's a pretty exciting/stressful job you shouldn't have to worry about supporting him any differently you wouldn't anyone else. He chose the career after all.

It is more of a turn off to me for a man to have a big butt than hardly one at all. A medium butt is okay but no a big assed man is definitely a turn off for me and I do not find them attractive at all.|`|y6BvpRtyaa	No. Girls should have the a**|`|sQYsMbQyaa	well i think they  matter completely  because you got to have something to grab at cause usually they are grabbing your breasts or butt and so yes it is very important for guys to have big butts|`|1UVLarLgaa	so you have a big fat buttocks. i like it only if i can lick it. and lipo suck the fat out of it through your butt hole

Well stories on the internet do. They tend to arouse me more than actual porn sometimes because my imagination combined with the story is much better than two people acting up for the camera.    Another reason is that the stories have more depth than two people just having sex and that always works for me.
Cqtb3T5Xaa	You do need to let go, but I don't think you really know how to do that just yet. You need to try a little harder to move on. Get him out of your head, every time you think about him just tell yourself no, not this time.

0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	No. Once you reported it lost, it was deactivated.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	most likely not. You reported it lost and requested a new one. Call your bank s customer service line for an accurate answer for your specific bank.|`|xaKIayoLaa	Actually, my bank told me that if I found my card to call them and let them know and they can cancel sending a new one.    It depends on your bank.  You need to call them to at least re activate it.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Nope. Once you report it lost, they deactivate the card in case anyone were to find it.

Flirting is not only a girl thing..Everyone loves to flirt and to be flirted..its a way to elevate the other person's ego (it will remind your target that they are a sexy being- when flirted) and for the person who does the flirting, it is a way to draw attention to their target and sends a message (Hey!!

Either way, I hope that they've already taught you sex ed and made you take care of the babies in class. Prepare yourself.    I know that the first time I saw a child birth, it scared me to death. Gosh, my best friend was 24 years old. The baby got stuck and my friend was in horrible pain. They tried to give her a shot to numb it but the contractions were so bad..and you know if you move when they are giving you that shot, you could get parlalyzed, right?

Don't cancel either, just go to different movies with both, see 15 minutes of each and then excuse yourself and go to the other one.

QSodlfMraa	well if you really like him thats all that should matter, i wish my boyfriend wanted to be with me all the time, i have no friend because i moved to the state a few years ago, and has all the friends.|`|TycCeqtaaa	everyone likes you its just that your bf is the one keeping you away from them. i've been through this before and now i have no friends except the ones that were always there if i needed them.  so you need to talk to your old friends and if your bf is like i want you to be with me all the time and siht then he's the one keeping you from your friends.  especially is he's the jealous type. that's how it starts. next thing you know he has to be with you everywhere you go.|`|VIDh3oUVaa	just start talking to someone in school or something.. and u need to tell ur bf that u need time for ur friends etc.. u should go out with ur best friend or anyone and meet more ppl with him but let ur bf know that u love HIM and noone else so u wont cheat on him or something|`|G1OJNCF4aa	thats how me & my bf were  then suddenly he wanted to spend time with his friends  and broke up with me  i was devastated because he was the one who wanted to spend so much time in the first place.  so try making some new friends and don't ALWAYS hang out with him on the weekends give him some space too :)
0FiXUaaWaa	Just tell him you like him. As a guy, i like it when girls are up front with me. And if he doesnt feel the same screw em and look for someone new.|`|HpMXIlLVaa	He is insecure.  He is trying to find out if you know of any guys who likes him.  So maybe you can help him a bit by asking any of his schoolmates if he is a nice kid, then go on from there|`|jGgRF3Yjaa	he like u as a friend.. : )|`|ziiYVYXZaa	if he cares about who you like he is interested and likes you!  guys arent that hard to figure out!  he prolly wants you for himself
Qz3sii2caa	Holy Mother of God... and you're saying you're having horrible lucky with guys LATELY? Right.    a) Fix your teeth  b) Wash your hair  c) Get cooler glasses (or ditch them altogether)  d) Wax your brows and above your lip  e) A little makeup couldn't hurt (you don't need to be The Joker, but a little eyeliner, blush and lip gloss goes a long way).    A huge positive: you're smiling. That I appreciate very much. It's shows you've got plenty of beauty on the inside. Time to harness that and let it shine on the outside.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	wear your hair down.  but no, your not ugly.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Same stuff they already said!

Let your hair down.

That is the most attractive thing!!|`|GuOJIftAaa	Well you are NOT ugly. Just try wearing your hair down once in while and maybe some cute square glasses. I think those would look really cute on you. Other than that, you're perfectly fine =] Don't worry about guys. They mature slower than we do so they're most (not all, mind you) just a waste of time till your older.|`|RHlM6jgoaa	Hi!  Listen, i am absolutely BEGGING you to look at this answer and take note. Because i was just where you are last year. I now have a gorgeousss boyfriend :).  READ..    PLUCK YOUR EYEBROWSS!!! .. or get somebody else to - proffesional.    Buy a teeth whitening product!!    Wear contact lenses - GET RID OF THE GLASSES.    Let down your hair, MIDDLE PARTING! STRAIGHTEN it!!.    A light foundation, some mascara, and lipgloss!          I swear. You'll see a massive change with lads..  I can bet your clothes are in need of a change too, just wear some jeans, a cute print tee, trainers/sneakers (depending on where you're from) and a bracelet.|`|LYIx7vfYaa	If the guy you date is one who only looks at your appearance, you are better off dating nobody.

You're either attracted to him or not.|`|MkchPOjFaa	umm eww jajaja wow i was mad that just made my night brigter jaja i needed that laugh oh and i givem a 0|`|GGJarL5Iaa	he looks like a bit of a dweeb.|`|zq7EgC4Xaa	aww he is adorable (in the sense that he is dad who wears glasses when he reads, etc. the way old people can be adorable.)|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Ew, zero.|`|ChMTXl3saa	His hair should be longer. He should smile. He takes pride in his appearance.|`|Nz73BSKraa	he's not ugly but not good looking enough to where you would want to be with him.   Like he has pretty eyes, but he need a lot of work.   A new outfit would be nice, unless he's a banker or lawyer then that a nice one for work, outside of work he needs something else.   More hair would be a plus, if not do somthing about what he does have.   And he def. needs a new nose well maybe not new but some work on the one he has now.   then maybe he might make it.  but with the picture you have he's about a 3.|`|UhK363oJaa	hes like a five not good ooking but not ugly either..|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	Looks friendly enough, but he has a slightly geeky look to his face so he has to be extremely cautious about what he wears to try and counteract it. He needs to wear suits that are not blue with white shirts. He should wear something more modern, like a cool cut charcoal suite with a colored shirt and cool tie. Also when he is out of work he needs to wear a little more rugged clothing that is in style and edgy. He really has to work with the clothes because he can't change the face. It isn't that he is bad looking at all, just has to work with the natural nerd look. Girls still like it though, he just has to make up for it with the clothes.    I was going to paste some pics for examples but I don't know how:(    Also growing a goatee would look hot!!|`|CX6Qcoamaa	is this some kinda jokE?

In other words, they cannot grasp that there are other points of view. I for example, cannot tell you anything based on the limited information given, however you are inferring we all know your current situation.    On the analysis of your question, you are very egocentric, and women do not like egocentrism in men, or any person in that matter.

8R8p6sFoaa	I am a guy, there are not any nice guys anymore.  I listen to the way my friends speak and the way other guys speak about girls, and it is disgusting, if a guy is really cocky or one who is very flirtatious he will probably cheat on you and talk about you like a ****, good guys are very rare, or i hate to sound shallow but attractive ones are very rare.  You could easily find a guy who will always be there for you but chances are that he wont be the best looking man around, i go to a school with about 1000 kids and only 2 guys i know are true to their girlfriends, also something to keep in mind is that if your looking for a nice sweet guy look at the shy guys they are usually very very sweet, also don't expect any guy to be near perfect (obviously) you ladies give us expectations i don't think any man can live up to.

n195n9Avaa	Sounds like you are never happy and he doesn't care if you are happy either...    He is probably cheating if he doesn't want sex from you, he is getting it somewhere..    I'd leave him..sorry honey, good luck.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I wonder what's going on in his life that it causes you to feel so unwanted, which by the way is totally wrong from him. My 1st was like that; finally one day I put my foot down good and heard. In all honesty you may have to do the same; however, as I did before I put my foot down I told him we're married and he'd better start acting accordingly. He disagreed and that's when my foot came down.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	Do you know were he goes? Work, out to the bars were? He keeps coming home there must be something there he likes.You say he TRIES to kiss you. Do you try to kiss him back? It sounds like you both need to talk(honestly)and openly. You both don't want to hurt the other but you need to talk and ask questions even if you both don't want to answer right then at least take some time to think about what the other asks. You say you don't feel pretty he must think you are he keeps coming home. Right! This may not be much help but it is a place to start and it is not over till you both give up. Wishing you both good luck.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	Leave: your situation is never going to change, you deserve to be happy|`|AA11286626	End it, just not working|`|XYvOg5Juaa	For how long has he been doing this?  For how long did you know each other before marriage?    I think what he needs to do is talk. And you need to listen  May be you need to relax a bit and analyze things in a different way. May be he just gets tired from work or he is planning a surprise for you.    You can try something different For eg. just one day, ignore him or Do things in such a way that he would need to approach you and talk to you. Don't argue or get angry. Explain to him nicely.      Give the relationship some time before you decide to walk out.  Sex is not the only thing in marriage.    Hope things work out for you    Good Luck|`|HA2GshmOaa	1-stay.... look at yr self in merror ,ask this question did i do evth for him  what he likes on me , lets me tell you the real answear sex is the key,,,,   how ,,,, call me @ 703- 401 4203 for more details|`|exFsWQy7aa	~"should i stay or should i go, duh duh, duh duh"  haha    hes gay hun  sorry|`|vJwl2uoBaa	You deserve happiness.

But I see you picture and your beautiful so that's not it! I hate to say it but you should leave him. Sometimes things are unfix-able and your just going to stay hurt if you don't go.     The reason I say this is because my ex-wife was JUST like your husband and I was like you. Life sucked.  If someone Truly loves you they will WANT to do anything to stay with you. I found that out the hard way. Trust me, true love is the best thing on EARTH but it takes 2 people.    One sided love just don't work:( But you don't have to take my advice but from what you have asked that's all I know how to help.    It hurts breaking up. But once your free and away from him life will feel so great again!|`|mUE5nSjpaa	Well only you can answer that question. If you are in a relationship or marriage it is a mutual thing. He has to be willing to work on things with you. He has to be willing to sit down and actually consider how you are feeling. Where is he going that he is not at home?  Is it possible that you are overreacting. I mean if he is going to work or something along those lines that I would say just relax. If he is going to a bar etc.. then that is definately an issue. A relationship takes work, its never as it is on television.. such a fairytale. It takes work and both people have to be willing to support each other and compromise. If he loves and cares about you, he will be there for you when you need him. Try to sit down with him again and talk it out. If he is not willing to listen...maybe you should think about counseling. Maybe he doesnt think its as serious as it is to you. Mention the possibility of leaving and see if he is more willing to try and work things out.|`|W5RVYkoiaa	i feel the same way about my wife.hang in there if you love him and you think he is worth it.you will always be beautiful.he cant stop that keep your head up and find a way to get  through to him
n195n9Avaa	If you aren't comfortable with it then don't.  It is about both of you being happy and what you want together so don't...    Plus I wouldn't have a kid unless I was married but that is just me.|`|RTxFNURzaa	Tell her dude|`|AA10413046	Don't have sex with her for starters.  If you do, you better double wrap.|`|t2sTqzu9aa	Tell her exactly that...|`|0PbYE3M7aa	you should really talk to her about it. you have to be pretty firm in telling her your not ready to be a father.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Tell her you should get married first and then have a baby or tell her your not ready yet!|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Uh, don't have a baby?  Are either of you even financially able to have a child right now?  They're really expensive, and if you haven't prepared a budget and gotten really good insurance for at least a year (takes a year for maternity benefits to kick in and believe me, they're necessary!), you shouldn't be having children right now.|`|ENCktJmtaa	how old are you now? are you guys the same age? if you're both the same age, compromise and go with 22. if you're different, tell her you don't think you'll be ready so young.|`|OQqAlHL8aa	tell her you'd rather spend more time to grow as a couple and have a child a little later in the relationship.|`|8e28748a17831ead96054edd5a8684fbaa	I think you should wait until you are 23|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	First, you should be married. Second, tell her you are not ready. And third, wrap yourself from head to toe in latex, because once a woman decides she wants to have a baby, it's a done deal.|`|wE2etBzbaa	That's very difficult drama you are in.  have you ever thought of telling her??    also dick is yours  and you are free to use it or not or to put condom on it.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	tell her that. if you dont think you'll be ready until 23, then wait. having a baby is a big deal.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Tell her you're not ready and wear a condom. No matter what you say, she's going to do what she wants anyway. And don't believe her if she tells you she's on the pill or any kind of birth control. She's going to get pregnant and trap you and in the end you'll be paying child support for the next 18 years when things don't work out.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	just have one you will be close to 22 when its born|`|yWyexrwRaa	tell her that it's not the right time yet. you need a stable job and save money for the future of your kids. explain it to her.|`|oPJYs4cQaa	talk to her and tell her your not ready to raise a kid yet, and that you would love to be the dad of her kids and that'll be enough for her to be ok with it and wait.|`|7YHmkdfXaa	Tell her that and make sure that you provide your own birth control until you are ready. I know that may sound a little weird, but woman are known to take it into their own hands and get knocked up.|`|Z3a1cRL7aa	Well, can you afford to have a baby?  I would look into the costs of it, it is REALLY EXPENSIVE.  As well, 23 is not that old.  I'm 23 and I don't want to even think about having a child for at least 5 more years.  Having a child takes a lot of your life away, it can also bring great joy.  I have friends that are 30, married w/no children and friends that are 28 with a couple of kids.  The 30 year olds look WAY younger.  As well, I wouldn't recommend having a child with your girlfriend, if you are that committed put a ring on her finger.  If your reasoning for not being married is that it is too expensive (ring, ceremony, etc.) then you cannot afford to have a child.  Also, ask her why she wants a baby.  She might just be looking for more commitment from you.|`|yNFkj3Iuaa	It's not a matter of age, it's a matter of responsibility.  You are both responsible for a child you bring into the world.  If either of you are not ready (financially, emotionally, or whatever), then you don't do it.  It's a matter of what's in the best interest of the child.
THXHdIfGaa	go for it! she'll understand, trust me|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Talk to your BFF and see if she likes him.  If she does then you'll have to find out how much she really likes him.  Then if she doesn't you can let her know that you're interested in him and ask her if its ok that you go for him.  If she does then you'd have to talk it out to see which of you goes for him.  But in reality, it all depends on which one of you (if either) this guy likes.  Good luck to you.|`|wFtL7OTpaa	talk to her about it... i recently did the same thing... but make sure its totally ok with her b4 u do anything wit him...|`|gWXjNa4gaa	o my dear!!! if ur bff likes him HE IS OFF LIMITS!!!! even if he likes u & u like him. the chances of u marrying this guy are slim so is ur friendship with ur really worth it?|`|ivwylzZEaa	talk to her about it....... you never know if maybe your suspicion is wrong... if she does..... who do you care about more? Ruining your friendship.... or getting this guy?|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	A caged death match will determine who has earned the right to pursue this boy. Both of you wil need to dip your hands in honey then cover them in glass shards. Random weapons will be thrown into the cage to ensure competitive balance. Best of luck.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Well first lets tackle down the problem of you and your bffl liking the same boy. If you're worried about this maybe you should talk to her about it, because you wouldn't want to get in a fight over a boy, that's just stupid. And as sad as it sounds, I've seen 4 best friends stop talking for a good few months because they all liked the same boy, stupidness eh? =) So next time your talking to your bffl maybe casually bring up the topic of this boy, and see how she reacts. Maybe say that you really like him and see if she really likes him too =)     Now lets see about the boy... I personally find it very difficult to tell when a guy likes you, maybe it's just me or maybe it's the guys that I like. Because I always think that when a boy is nice to me that I might just have a chance with him, normalyl when this happens it just turns out that the guy is just really sweet and nice to begin with. But maybe watch how your crush acts around other girls =). Does he flirt with you(oh la la fun), does he compliment you, does he make up lame excuses to talk to you, does he tease you? =) All of these can point in the same direction of, ..... crushes!!! If your really unsure, I would recommend getting to know your crush better and seeing where things go =) Maybe try hanging out outside of school?;)    Good luck, e-mail me if you need more help, I'm glad to help out the best I can =D|`|ZWSS8eRfaa	Sisters before misters.|`|cUwbfosuaa	Screw the guy, friends go first.|`|oPJYs4cQaa	oh that's bad!  you should talk to your best friend and if he likes you so what?  you like him to!|`|u72QPS8jaa	flirt with the guy make him ask you out and tell your friend "he asked me out and i really like him aswel so i said yes im sorry"  if he likes you and you like him than thats final its"too bad" for your bff(she'll get over it) even though at the time she will be alittle crushed|`|tOLrUh0Caa	Talk it out.|`|bnMdxxYlaa	Let him be the one to chose.|`|k5unIdZmaa	It would depend on your bff. Most likey they wouldnt want you to not go out with them since they like him too. But your Bff might just want you to feal happy but i would talk to your friend first before anything else happens.
JZkCVHJAaa	sounds like a hint, but consider how he said it and his body language when he said it|`|CU1WRghVaa	Just Go! xD|`|Tpa7wcQXaa	It is definately a big hint.  If he wasn't interested you would have got a vague answer, but him telling you he would be there the next day is him trying to feel out if you're interested too.  I suggest you go tomorrow, but don't be early or really on time.  It makes you more desireable, yet still shows your interested.   :)|`|FJZXTLH3aa	i dont think its a good ideal idea to go out with neighbour you better line yourself up or forget about this peggy neighbour.|`|sYSEYHAzaa	Ask him if hes lonely when he goes to these places and if he says yes ask him if he wants some company|`|8WP9Gu1saa	Obviously it is a suggestion of interest and a hint but it lacks conviction on his part.  It sounds like, "I know a place, I will be there, if you want to go, but it will be at your own risk".  You should have asked him directly if its a date rather than assuming it is. Real man speak his mind out and knows what he wants. It is better be clear than sorry, careful!|`|1TKfwDGsaa	Sounds like he wants to go.|`|u72QPS8jaa	dont go!  thats really low us women have pride!  if he wanted you to go he would have asked you to!  if you go you could end up looking silly  guys know what they want and if he wanted you there he would have said so so just give it sometime you two will get to know each other and if hes interested enough he will ask you out|`|546f8e582c11c31d20c750213d4c7bbbaa	go girl!!!|`|HFmh8uF4aa	You shouldnt go this time you might seem desperate. All you have to do is ask him if he wants to go there sometime with you.. Just say ugh i cohldnt go to tht place yesterday but maybe next time we could go together|`|CyIxcsz0aa	You don't need to go tomorrow. If you do, go fashionably late (aka with girl friends after the night life is already started!) But either way, take it easy. He may have been friendly or he may be into you. If he's interested, don't hand yourself over. Take the tid bit, and save it for later. Feel him out, flirt, but don't give yourself away.
n195n9Avaa	Because people are jealous of her...I go through the same thing.    You have straightened up your life and the people that haven't don't like it.|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	If you're happy that should be all that matters.   It is strange though....that people around us like to see us fail...most of the time they do this subconsiously. Human nature i guess.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Because they're all jealous that they've lost you to her... That's the truth.. they want more of you.. but they can't have that... so they blame her since she's taken you from them and their pathetic lives.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Ask them.  I don't hate her; I don't even know her.  So go straight to the source and ask your friends and parents why they hate her.    Props to you for turning your life around.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	All of those people are part of a lifestyle that you've abandoned, you just haven't gotten rid of the baggage (them)... eventually you'll move on with your life with her and leave all the rest behind.|`|oLYFG25daa	its just because you've changed so much they think that she forced you to change you should explain to them that you WANTED the change and she helped you through it. And tell your family that you love her and will not stand for their comments about her, that she has helped you so much and you think they should be happy for you. If you dont stand up for her they will never respect her, or understand what she is to you.|`|kpi69PHWaa	I think you yourself nailed it. She helped you turn your life around, and they want their old drinking, screwed-his-life-up friend back.   On the other hand, you can at least ask them why- and really listen to their answers. Don't turn it into a confrontation. If you disagree with what they say, and still think she's great. Well, that's their problem. Thank her for saving your life.|`|rOeUOFZOaa	Maybe she's a complete *****? try asking them?    Or don't.  **** what other people think. As long as you love her that's all that matters.|`|yE2KiCXCaa	Well, the reason your friends hate her is because when you didn't date her you we're loads of fun and instead she wants to watch movies with you at home. That's pretty normal. And you should love her unconditionally if she's boring or not, but if you don't, take her places that ARE fun instead of where you get hammered. :P But, your parents will always dislike the girls you are with. Because you're their little boy that's growing up and not needing them anymore. Talk to them and I'm sure that's the reason. Don't listen to what anybody says. If you love her, you love her|`|bnMdxxYlaa	I bet you are doing very well financially too, it never goes down well with guy friends who r not making any progress in life.  I have a brother and if i like his girlfriend, it means she is 101% good for him.
cgb4WOnVaa	Just be friends with both..   and when the time is right - either A, or B, or C that you haven't met yet will prove to be the one you should be "more than friends" with.|`|8DDK2K5baa	guy b for sure. u will never see the first one|`|xYa8i0mTaa	have a threesome you hornie little slutbag...LOL|`|024yRfqtaa	eiffel tower|`|7E1mbz4jaa	i wouldn't worry, every thing will work out in time :)  although you should rethink how you would go with a long-distant relationship??  good luck :)
wCJdbMakaa	totally cute!  girls luvv cute and (sometimes corny) texts.  (=|`|UldvbAIWaa	do with that. but really dont listen to us about what to say. be yourself cuz when you act like someone you think she wud want your prob wrong. just be yourself. that wat she really wants, and be funny, smart but not patronizing or condescending and be charming. good luck|`|wFtL7OTpaa	thats perfect :)|`|pX8qJzjIaa	corny funny, kinda sketchy.  just be yourself it will work if she likes you|`|VHAqpggPaa	txt the reason i missed ur call was i was getting u flowers in my dream 4 being together|`|rRlD215Paa	Aw that's cute.  You could start it by saying "Sorry I missed your call.... I must have been too busy dreaming about you."  I think that's really cute and I would definitely smile if a guy sent me that.  Good luck!|`|WbKOivguaa	sorry i missed your call, but this girl jessica was over for the night|`|0RvZ7IkMaa	hah aw, that's cute. but probably change the "lol" to ":p". otherwise you still kinda sound serious about it, but the stick-out-the-tongue smiley is waaaay less weird and much more "awwwwww!"
oSL7QfICaa	hmm....   1 Nobody should really EXPECT anything, you should be slowly progressing as you feel is right                                          2 ...I think this is mainly to do with peer pressure, and to gain popularity. I've noticed this a lot too and thinks it's good that someone else actually also has the big picture( I also think that its to do with parents/teachers saying no, so some of them enjoy the fact that their doing these things that they really shouldn't be, ...like stealing cookies when your four....well...you get the picture) , just don't be stuffed with those types, seriously , it's all just a huge waste of time, and if get asked by one of them just give them a blunt no....easy as that :P. Hope this helped|`|1VPFZEZAaa	they want sex.   no lie about that.  if your not givin they're not gonna keep you around for long  they will tell you what you wanna hear till you give in.    but some arent like that granted im a girl but i have guy friends and my brother for experience of this.    just dont let them take something like that from you unless you know for a fact your ready.|`|LqEcE32jaa	well im 14 and what i want is to not be afraid to hold hands in public or hug, kiss, etc well not wanting to kiss in public is alright i guess. um dont be prude, i freakin hate that so much and all of my friends do to and probly most boys in the world. talk to him everyday but dont talk to him to much thats just creepy. dont be shy. be fun. be flirty. and ya|`|1FAggU5Zaa	yeah i say u wait till ur like 17 or 18 to have a girlfriend.....|`|1QvJRmpHaa	im a 15 yr old girl    i know some people in my grade have had sex  and others have never even had a conversation with a boy  everyone is diff  but overall, the NORMAL at my school is hooking up (aka. making out, pashing, french kissing...whatever u wanna call it)    like, thats what most people have done and do with their boyfs or girlfs    but never do anything u feel uncomfortable with just because a guy wants u to or because its "cool" or "normal"  u'll only regret it and it'll make u feel worthless or weak    and i know: boys are so confusing|`|EsnFmcMFaa	im 18  when i was 14 i just wanted a girl to be nice and just willing to talk and possibly be friends. That's really it   i wasnt looking for a gf back when i was 14 so i was just looking for  a friend    its ok that you dont want to go as far as your friends now  when you feel you are ready you are ready  its your choice to make  just be careful because guys in high school can be real jerks and just like you for your body and nothing else|`|AA10768321	You don't sound like a prude freak. If you don't feel comfortable going past a certain point, DON'T. I applaud you for sticking to what you feel is right for you.    The stereotype is that teenage boys only want sex from the girls they date, but, while a fair amount of them do, this is not necessarily the norm. I think that a lot of them are as unsure as you seem to be, but society (at least, high school society) dictates that a guy past the age of 16 who is still a virgin is "uncool." This gives them the idea that they have to have sex, even if they know they aren't ready for it.    As a person who waited until she was 21 to have sex (simply because I was waiting to find someone who I was comfortable with and who deserved me), I can tell you that it is much better to wait for a person you feel totally comfortable with. It's all about when YOU feel comfortable, and don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|nyeUUojFaa	im 14, ive never even been out with a boy.|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Quote "if your not a boy around my age it's okay.. i'd still like to here what you think".    You are asking for trouble! :)    Anyways, me I look for a loving and sensible girl... That's it and to expect more means to forgo a chance of meeting a beautiful person!|`|2y9SmCm3aa	for ur age id say just to feel on eachother but thats it nothing further  so u can you have atleast done something|`|lU8ucOpjaa	Go at your own pase.  In my opinion 14 year olds should NOT be doing the things they are now a days.  Kids are growing up wayyy to fast.    Do whatever you feel is comfortable and that is 110% normal.  Don't compare yourself to them do what you feel is right and dont feel like you have to be pressured to do stuff with guys just because your friends do.  You will just grow up to regret it.  Wait to do whatever it may be until you are ready, 1 4 is *like you said* young.  Just have fun and don't make guys your number one worry.|`|CqpK9LC1aa	You are NOT being prude, (like your slutty little hormonal teenage friends) but rather being EXTREMELY wise.     Teenage guys expect a lot from girls. Mostly because they want their future gf to look like she just stepped off from the Playboy Magazine or something. They'll mostly care about what physical attributes this or that female has.     You're waaaayyy too young to be thinking about going all the way. Save it and you won't regret it.|`|h6lZKeyRaa	K I'm a 13 year old guy incase you wanted to know and I kind of expect from girls is for them to let me talk to them without them being really shy and hide in the bathroom when I try to talk to them and if it's ok with their parents for me to eventually take em to the movies or somthing if we both like eachother and I've asked her out|`|2ijHmVeSaa	Im 16 and i like having sex..  actually i loveee it  most people do... lol  when i was still a virgin, sex wasn't on my mind that much.  but after i had sex with my girlfriend for the first time i wanted to do it a lot more and it was on my mind a lot more.  guys want to do stuff with you. They want to get into your pants.  you are right, you are young and you shouldn't go as far as them.  you should wait for when you are ready and when you've found a good guy that isn't only interested in sex, which is hard and if/when you do eventually do it with him the guy is probably going to want to do it a lot. so keep that in mind..|`|3EM66IWFaa	Only a time pass|`|ZQPsrNBXaa	I'm not a boy but i AM around your age and I know for a fact that all boys have on there brain is sex, and that would be what you call normal for them.. And you are still young, and I wouldnt be doing what they ask you to do, don't follow your friends.|`|EjETqyceaa	i think you should just stick to kissing and holding hands. your only 14! you dont want to rush into things and look back at it and regret it. trust me and just take your time. who cares if your friends are doing "more" stuff then you. you dont have to be like them. Dont turn into a slut either, you dont want that reputation. so take my advice and take things slow, and if the guy u are dating dumps u because of this then u deserve better.|`|Yq76jKOxaa	im a 14 year old boy and if the girl i liked wuld go out with me i wuld b the happiest guy in the world maybe later i mite want sex but at the moment just 2 b with the girl i love would meen everythin 2 me|`|02cSvBAYaa	I'm currently 22 and I am going to let you know that you should just wait. I didn't loose my virginity til I was 20 years old. I had plenty of chances when I was in highschool but I decided to wait. You are still to  young to be thinking about it. I now sleep around with quite a few girls and everytime I talk to one of them they always tell me they wish they could've waited til after highschool. So now I would say just stick to kissing and going on dates. Guys that age always prefer a girl who is a tease.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	How about a woman in her 20's who also started experimenting at 14?    1. Don't do anything you're not comfortable with, because you will end up hating the guy who you do it with, and you'll blame him. You'll also hate yourself for caving into peer pressure.    2. Keep in mind that boys don't really know what they're doing either. I promise you that there isn't a single 14 year old boy in the world who would really know whether or not you're prude. Boys who talk a lot about sex at this age have not had nearly as much sex as they say they have...(you'll find this holds true for most things: if someone has to brag a lot, they're probably exaggerating).     3. I don't recommend losing your virginity this early. You won't enjoy it. Like I said before, they don't know what they're doing, and you won't have an orgasm. Let your first time be special, with a long-term boyfriend. If it's someone who cares about you, they're going to take their time and make sure it feels as good as it can for you, too.    4. If you find someone you would like to experiment with, don't expect too much at first. Whether we're talking about mutual masturbation, or actual sex, it usually won't be great the first few times.     5. The safest sex you can have is mutual masturbation, i.e. "fingering", or "hand jobs"(unless you count cyber-sex). This is usually pretty safe, but everyone should wash their hands before. You should also consider lube, or at least use some spit. Dry skin hurts for both of you. I don't know what you've done before, but if you're thinking about becoming sexual, you should start here, and don't agree to anything else until you're 110% comfortable.    6. OH YES! Most important of all: boys at this age will tell you ANYTHING to get in your pants. They will tell you they love you. They will tell you that you were meant to be together and that you will have children when you grow up...I promise you that it's all lies. They might mean it at the time, but they will change their minds as they grow up. You will too. As much as my first boyfriend hurt me, when I was 14, I can hardly remember ever loving him. It's like some silly dream.     Be careful who you lose your virginity to, because you will remember them for the rest of your life.
MANsOMw8aa	You guys need more communication. That's probably where he is trying to get. He is tired of wondering...he was shy at first though.     Talk to him. You guys can never been in a relationship based on attraction only. You have to have a real relationship.     The best way to do that is to talk, at least he is trying.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Oh honey, I think this boy might just very well have a crush =)  But then again, he could just be being nice =( But let us hope that you have better luck than I do.  For starters just because he says hi to you in the hallways and what not is totally awesomeeee. I am actually really jealous of you for that =D.   The guy I like I would sometimes see him looking at me, and once I thought he smiled at me and like in the hallways he would always look at me... but then I found out he likes "someone else". But then again I have the worst luck =(.  But lets hope this boy digs you back. Why? Because then you guys can date, YAY! Lets see what else, well he seems to always be trying to talk to you right? Why would he want to talk to someone if he wasn't interested... am I right? =D  So maybe you should ask him to hang out or maybe ask him if he likes you =D  And if he says no to either of those(I'm crossing my fingers that he doesn't), just say something like "Oh my friends dared me to ask you" or "Okay good, I just wanted to see what you'd say".  I wish you luck darling!  Lets hope for the best!|`|gqD0P4mYaa	He probably is trying to get your attention. Get to know him a little better. Maybe next time when he's handing out papers, have a little chat with him. Who knows, maybe he could like you, maybe he can't it all just goes to show that you guys have to have some sort of connection going on with those glances. If he has ever smiled at you while he glanced at you, smile back if your interested in him. If not, just simply look away. Good Luck!|`|OQqAlHL8aa	you could have stopped after the first sentence and the answer still would have been yes.|`|u72QPS8jaa	lol well darling it sounds like hes majorly flirting with you  if hes interested enough he will get your number or ask you out!  so dont make any rash moves and ask him out or anything coz you have your pride to think about  but if you like him flirt back and seriously if hes interested enough he will make the first 'real' move:)    goodluck|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	Well if you haven't contrived well over half of this story then I'm gonna go ahead and give you the go/thumbs up/smiley face :) to engage on this stud that you've lain your eyes on for the past ten years. Of course, if you don't like him, I'd file a restraining order instaed!
6GUpUXoXaa	Flirt.  Girls like attention just as much as guys do but girls know how to get it.  It doens't matter if her boyfriend is a jerk or not she has a boyfriend and you have to respect that.  If you are going to get more attached to her because of the way that she flirts it would probably be a good idea to tell her that your uncomfortable with what she is doing.  Think about it, what if you were her boyfriend and she was doing that with some other guy, is that the type of girl you would want to be with?  If she liked you as much as she acts like she does she would have broken up with the other guy.|`|QZgzePebaa	wow im like the same position as you|`|otiBw8WYaa	I like a girl at work that has a boyfriend too. And she flirts a lot too....    HEY WHERE DO U WORK???
ZaPj1OIbaa	you have to show her that you can be yourself around her and make her laugh, if someone says something mean to her kick their @$$ If she's sad cheer her up. Its small things like that that attract us to guys|`|yyf2U8kjaa	ask her if she wants to read the book of mormon with you.|`|tsdHndRhaa	theres no secret or magic potion to that, if she likes she does and if not oh well, the only thing you have to be to anyone is yourself and if they don;t like it thats there issue not yours.|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Get a six pack and show it off , next thing you know the girls will be chasing you down the road :)
mUE5nSjpaa	Wow did you really just ask that question??? I swear I need to create a website and just give people advice all day. You need to break it off with her ASAP! There is nothing worse then someone leading you on. THe longer you wait to find a way to break up with her, the worse it will be once you do it. Sit down and explain it to her... Let her know what you think the two of you should just be friends instead. As for the daughter, if you want to play daddy then more power to you but I personally think you should just break up and move on in every way. In the future when she finds someone else it will create issues for her and may be confusing to the child. Be a man, step up, get a backbone and do what you have to do. It doesnt matter how you do it, she is going to think you are a jerk... she cares about you and your breaking up with her so that is natural for her to think that... You can do it.. stop wasting her time!!!!|`|QSodlfMraa	you would be an asshole if you kept on leading her on. just break up with her.|`|1VPFZEZAaa	Tell her you don't think the relationships going anywhere bf/gf wise ..tell her you love her and always will love her but not in that way and you love her daughter and wanna continue to be a part of her life, and that you'd rather be just close friends, she'll most likely understand maybe not at first but give her time and she will.|`|s1leABaSaa	your in abit of a pickle. man thats gotta hurt.|`|GuOJIftAaa	And why cant you break up with her yourself? It's better than leading her on.|`|JZkCVHJAaa	if you care about her and her daughter you should tell the truth just because your not dating doesn't mean you can't be friends and still remain active in her daughters life but don't put yourself through with if if your not going to be happy you'd be living a lie and that's not fair to them or yourself|`|9RajlJpRaa	guy, u are a jerk if you have been wanting her to break up with you. and why are you feeling this way if you say you love her? i think you dont really want to break up bc if you did, you would have already! so maybe you need to re-evaluate the situation. then if you still dont want to be her bf anymore, then you need to be a man and end it.   my EX got me to break up with him by cheating on me. finally he confessed he did it to make me break up.   Wanting the girl to do it is just being mean and lazy!|`|AA10025847	Honestly, I think you need to clarify why YOU don't want to break up with her.    You're just putting more work on yourself with trying to get her to break up with you.     Well, the only thing I can tell you is to try to get her to notice more of your flaws, turn offs.|`|Lef6vVQAaa	Ask anyone of your friends this question that's actually used this tactic to get out of a relationship, and ask them how it went.      What is so terrible about getting out of something ( and being man enough to state that, and give real reasons)?    I know personally, it would be much easier for me to continue a friendship, or have some kind of peace between myself and the other person if they were just honest. I'm sure that she would appreciate that as well.     What would be hard is being led on, another day, and basically being lied to....    The choice is yours, but every human being has the ability to do what is right.    Do that, and you can't go wrong.    As far as the child, it's better that she doesn't see mommy going through a relationship like this where one person is obviously emotionally detatched.    Think about the child.    They will be fine without you, I'm sure.|`|7YHmkdfXaa	So you want this girl to break up with you...but you want to stay around in her life so that you can continue to be a father figure to her child. That just sounds like  a creeper thing to me. How bout you try telling her that you dont feel that you guys are going anywhere together and that you would like to remain friends and be there for her and her daughter.|`|GGJarL5Iaa	You've only been together a few months and you have a child?|`|wZuBbA2Xaa	tell her this|`|Iz5kUsCGaa	to be honest mate, what ever way you do it, it is gona hurt a lot, but if the mother starts to hate u she wont let you be apart of the girls life.   you have to try explain to her, but what ever the outcome she will be hurt very hurt.
DKufXulOaa	You could mix it up with alittle buy and alitttle make. I used this idea last year...So here it is;    GET SOME SORT OF BASKET/A BUNCH OF BOXES (so he has to open up every single one)    USE THE FIVE SENSE:   HEAR: Burn a CD with you guys song (im assuming you have one)  SEE: Frame a picture of the two of you, an engraved watch  TOUCH: Maybe a teddy bear he won you at a carnival OR something that you can touch that represents your love (a heart pillow)  SMELL: maybe your perfume...or his  TASTE: candy/chocolate, yumm. or if your a cooker, you could cook him dinner    When you've thought of all you want to do you can either put it in a decorative basket OR put ever single "sense" in a different box, according to the size of your gifts     I know that this seems sooo cheesy, but when i gave this gift to my guy, he was nearly in tears at how creative and thoughtful it was    GOOD LUCK picking a gift!|`|W6uHaI1kaa	I dont think that you should get him something expensive because valentines day is supposed to be about you two, not about presents. So i think that you should give him something that means something like and old picture of when you two started dating, in a nice frame or something.  Good Luck :)|`|hA6JDWsFaa	cook and bake him something, give him a great smelling perfume, rent a movie and reminisce on the good times you two have shared.|`|CU1WRghVaa	A Hooker xD Jk maybe Romantic dinner or some shlt maybe you can give him a ipod or shoes|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Get him and yourself a couples massage at a spa. Or cologne maybe, original i know...maybe a gift certificate for his favorite restaurant for the both of you or maybe a gift certificate for paintballing or something he has a hobby in or to go get some new clothes from his favorite store.|`|s1leABaSaa	Get him a teddy.  mines nearly 19 and we been going out for nearly 3 years.|`|R0M1WCmZaa	give you an idea...go to funnewjersey.com and if you find something that you like then go to your yahoo search with name of place with your town..and lovingyou.com are the best of website!! they will tell you everything!|`|9RajlJpRaa	nothing! make him a valentine and make him dinner wearing something sexy!|`|NdOwsxsqaa	sum cute jeans from somewhere he likes then put a cute note and sum chocolate in the pockets..|`|1VP9TUVOaa	If he really cares about you, i think he will appreciate something sentimental better. How about a racy calendar with some hot pics of you.|`|HArDflVEaa	um mabyeeeee well if he has a sense of humor a whoppe coshin but special.........mabye.....well hey u know the guy not us look in ur heart look in his heart find the answer what does he like? what are his hobbies? what does he do on weekends? does he like sports? get him sports tickets? monster trucks? monster truck tickets? vacation for u guys together whats his fav vacation spot? dont forget to throw in some chocolate, hope i helped!|`|2Jw3OniLaa	A very thoughtful gift is a watch...you can have the back engraved with something sweet on it with the date....he will think of you whenever he checks the time...    It's a classy gift...    Also, since your his gf...give it to him wrapped with nothing on...that should really punctuate the intimacy of the gift  ; )    If your not up for that, buy a sexy nightgown to deliver the goods...    a show stopper for sure....|`|oOGxok8vaa	Wow, you really do care about your boyfriend! Make him a nice dinner! If I was in his shoes, I would love it! I think food is the best way to a man's heart...hahah that's just me being a lil' piggy. But yeah. Some nice food and wine and set the ambiance too. I think your boyfriend will really appreciate the time you put into it. Also maybe instead of getting something from a store, make your own chocolates. I did that for my girlfriend and SHE LOVED IT. I tried it, and it was pretty decent. There are many good chocolate recipies out there. Or instead of making chocolate, you can make chocolate dipped strawberries. *drools*    Good luck and a happy early Valintines day!|`|GuOJIftAaa	Well, I'm giving my fiance a whole Valentines Day weekend. I cant say exactly what since he comes on here too, but why don't you do something each day for the weekend. Like friday, you can have a quite romantic time at home. Then on valentines day you can go out on the town and do some dancing or a romantic dinner and sometime during the night give him a gift or two, and then the next morning you can cook him a breakfast of his favorite things? Just some ideas. =]|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	an ipod|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	That all depends on what you gave him on the last two valentines. Presents should get progressively bigger from year to year, so I hope you haven't outdone yourself yet.|`|nSsmh3i4aa	A rimjob, he will like it!|`|yWyexrwRaa	maybe a perfume or a shirt that would look good on him. for sure u know what perfume suits for him and a shirt that looks good on him.
GbzQy1tyaa	sure you could but depends really on the judge|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	You still might get joint custidy but you will get you kid(s) %90 of the time and your ex will get at most %10, there is a slight chance you get full custidy though|`|2oFJIibRaa	They must have had more than just his word to take custody away from you sweaty, so maybe you should try telling all then you will get a good answer.
xb7ey8c0aa	Do not be coy with this guy.  At this point I do not see a stalker problem, but you need to tell him you are not interested in a friendship and to please leave you alone.  If he keeps bothering you tell a teacher, the principal or your parents.
cgb4WOnVaa	Sweetheart - my heart goes out to you.  This must be very frightening for you.  Not to mention very upsetting because you don't want what he wants.    You should seek counsel within your family and your mosque.  I doubt that you will find helpful advice here.  Perhaps people who mean well, but none that can truly know what you're going through.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	talk to him and tell him you still want to be with him.. and learn to control your tongue lady... don't you know you're supposed to change for the better when you're married?|`|XxzuYQagaa	Hi dont loose heart,reduce your short temper, be friendly show more affectionate -care him  with good thing  persue the thing  dont argue.  visit therapist and holy places -Ensure him u are loving him
2iDvyoXhaa	I don't blame you, and I wouldn't be comfortable with it either. You need to meet this girl to make sure SHE knows about YOU.    Not to alarm you, but a friend of mine (a guy) was in a similar situation and it turned out that her "best friend" was actually her BOYFRIEND of 3 years. So the hobag had been cheating on her boyfriend with my friend for over a year before all this crap hit the fan. It's crazy what some people do....|`|KwNpyp3saa	I don't blame you. Why haven't you met her? Think about that. He may be hiding something.|`|RiHiOCANaa	That you feel uncomfortable is normal. Its not right they cAn have tjoughts about each other or even do things
7KJcMpl9aa	More important to love.  If you're both so busy loving each other that you aren't concerned how much love you receive, neither of you will go without.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Be loved.  Yes, call me selfish.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	to love my partner. But you need to have both for a relationshipp to work it cant go one or the other.|`|rqNb6FIraa	What is more important to me is to be loved.

They're both very important!!|`|TjCA8T0Uaa	This is such a dumb, cliche overloaded question.|`|WtElgJDtaa	Both, but even if you dont get a lot of love. im pretty sure your partner still loves you, but maybe is just afraid to show it. But you should, too, show love to your partner.     Good question!|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	i love my partner|`|KM0SHgwBaa	You need it both ways, if you don't have it both ways... it sux.

YnG0Tjxjaa	Be yourself. If he doesn't like it, too bad. Keep conversation flowing. Ask him questions, try to make sure you're not talking about yourself too much. Pay attention to the things he says about himself and his life. Even if your surroundings are bland, a good conversation will keep a good time. Look like you normally look. Don't dress too fancy for a first date. Just be yourself.|`|AA12022610	just be yourself|`|13uu4bbQaa	Don't be nervous!!!   Be as calm as can be!   Cause that can lead you into TRAGEDY!!   Believe me ive experience that first hand!!|`|XNkgwFrBaa	Play Hide and Seek :)|`|7y63ZzK4aa	here are some tips that should help u!    1. look into the mirror and pretend ur talking to ur date! imagine u lbf is a loser and u have np talking to him  2. practice making out either with ur dad or a teddy bear  3. order the most disgusting, expenisive thing on the menu  4. when u notice ur date eating a lot tell him he's gonna be fat, and that i dont date fatties  5. always make the first move|`|4e95e8fa9d5ea0035e542f7c3659555baa	Firstly, try to look presentable. If you know you look presentable, then you would have confidence. Be a girl that your date would definitely respect. Don't talk about past relationships, guys seem to hate it when you talk of exes. Be yourself! Don't try too hard because it will show. Good luck!|`|u72QPS8jaa	DOS/DONTS  dont talk about past relationships  dont seem awkward  do look at him when your talking to him i mean at his eyes coz its rude to look somewhere else when your talking  do be yourself!  dont be a fake guys can tell!  do be casual and make him feel comfortable  do ask questions(not too many though) get a convo flowing
0AYPgUQIaa	Well, 9 years of history cannot be erased that easily, probably that's the reason they stayed friends. But arranging a meeting between the two of you would be really awkward. You would just sit there, looking out of your head while those two share good laughs because they already know everything about each other.  This would bother me too, but telling him not to be in touch with her isn't the answer either. The problem is not what is happening today, but what might happen later.  Think about it: you two have a fight in the future and who is he going to meet then? The X. Old emotions flaring up and the next scene: your boyfriend and his ex having passionate sex while you are at home, worried to death. This is the problem.  I don't believe in guy-girl friendship, let alone ex-ex friendship(of 9 years). If you tell your boyfriend that you don't like that he is still in contact with his X, he will tell you he won't and keep doing it anyway. The secrecy gives the whole thing a thrill and another problem is born.  If I were you I would feel pretty badly about this "talk to each other about the people they are dating", because I would think that they meet and talk about me and our relationship like I would be some merchandise. I would feel the whole relationship trivial compared to theirs.  Ask him what he thinks where your relationship is heading. Does he even take it seriously, or is he just fooling around? Tell him that it bothers you that he still meets his X(despite the risk). Tell him why you feel like this. If he cares about you, he won't meet her again(but let an option open for him, email). If he tells you "I meet whoever I want", then it augurs no good for the two of you. If he doesn't care about your feelings(especially in a delicate matter like this), then he doesn't deserve them.|`|DPJRlxOwaa	I wouldnt worry too much about it. Nine years is a long time to be dating. I'm sure they weren't just strictly BF/GF the whole time. They probably just got to be good friends as well.|`|W7ZfFxTxaa	don't bring fire near gasoline ,you know what i mean
eY4RubMSaa	Ah... this is a sensitive situation. I'm 15, and my friend DID do this. He asked her out, and she said yes.    If you're going to see this guy regularly - and it won't just be an online relationship, maybe yes. If you really do like him, and you know he returns your feelings. Also take into consideration the age difference - he may be looking for something different in a relationship than you. Don't let him pressure you into sex - I was, and I regretted it. Completely ruined our relationship.    But, if you're only going to see the guy twice a year, and it's going to be mostly online, I'd say it's a bad idea. Things like that never work out, and you don't get an accurate feel of what the person's really like.    Hope I helped. :)|`|yeYL8Udoaa	just dont do it and let your parents know your dating him and you should be fine...|`|DytfqrkSaa	Internet isnt a bad way to start out first of all. It lets you talk and develop a strong emotional connection without letting the physical be a reason why you're dating someone. Secondly, it's not illegal unless you have sex. If he asks you out, why not? Give it a shot.|`|rKsgGHKkaa	i think its only illegal if u guys "do it".  but if u lyk him that much i say u should go 4 it.|`|6OVDBiCnaa	ok sweetie im gonna help u out a lil    iight when i was 16 i was totally into a 20 yr old  then after i was done with the twenty yr old  i lost my V to a 25 yr old  age is just a number...  when ur 16 it'll be the same way it was with me n the first guy i was talkin bout      age is just a number just remember that    u will always no matter what be four years younger than this guy if ur 14 or 21     start early get to kno each other enjoy the experience...    have fun    i hoped i helped        best answer!!! :)|`|cnmm7vPzaa	It totally depends on what you mean. I personally don't think it's a huge problem to date but obviously you shouldn't have sex with him. On the other hand he might be a little too old. Final answer is I think it would be fine just as long as you get to know him better before anything serious happens and be smart as in be careful of what you do   HOPE I HELPED :D BEST ANSWER ME PLZ
0ky4TktEaa	He may not have decided you're not interested but it has most likely put a damper on whatever chemistry he was feeling. Even if you are truly busy, mentioning that to a guy you've only just had a first date with is not a good idea when he approaches you for a second date. Call him up and talk to him when you have free time; if you don't and you like this guy, MAKE some time. Just to let him know you haven't forgotten him. Set aside a time for another date with him, even if it's just a very fast lunch between whatever you're doing. You have to give him some sign you're not just ignoring him.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	He might. How about you email him telling him which dates you are free next week, that way he will know for sure that you really are not blowing him off.
4bpBn6Taaa	first just ask her like what she did for her assignment   say hi  or just be spontaneous...|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Stay calm and the best thing is to stay true to yourself and dont forget to smile.

i4XDfijnaa	First thing you have to do is stop treating her like a child, you sound more like a concerned parent than her boyfriend.  Maybe her involvement in the business networking group is more beneficial than studying from books anyway its her life not yours.  She may not be your girlfriend for long if you don't change your ways, start acting more like a boyfriend, than her father.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I think you may have confused your girlfriend with your daughter.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Some people just gotta learn the hard way.|`|jTVbjyghaa	It's her life. Let her f*ck it up however she sees fit.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Well some people just don't/can't study. Personally I study very little, the most I study for ever is half an hour and that's really rare. I am somewhat like her I guess, I don't worry about exams, and I always do fine compared to my friends who study and stress and then make mistakes. Just leave her be, she knows what to do with herself, she knows how her brain works.|`|9RajlJpRaa	aw its cute that you care! my boyfriend always tries to get me to study too. but it never works. try to lure her to her books by studying with her. and if you have nothing to study for, then help her study by showing her how to. this girl is obviously distracted!|`|59CaFeS8aa	quickies|`|QBGszg3waa	she will fail, and then learn|`|13uu4bbQaa	Just sit her down and be straight out with her.  Ask her if she cares at all of the consequences of not studying?|`|AA12011409	haha ur cute    u can threaten to break up wid her?? maybe that'l work?  or u can just give up on her.....and tell her u don give a damn  that wuld prolly make her study    reverse psychology u see :P|`|ba9aa8b3d71c1e710f4561957c0e0684aa	it is her choice to study or not. If and when she fails, then she might reconsider her ideas of what is important.    The more important question is is this the kind of woman you want to be with? If not you certainly have an out. You sound like a man who wants to study and do well so why not concentrate on YOUR life and let her live her own life.|`|kAlDPBz7aa	Some people dont need to study.. and it sounds like she is one of those people. Some ppl are born naturally smart, which means they dont have study information to learn it.. I'm sure she knows herself more than you do;)|`|pW5pGNTZaa	Hey, i never study and still manage to get damn good marks so what r u complaining about?

That's about all you can do.|`|LcGQllH0aa	It's her life, not yours. You can't force her to do anything you want her to do.

ggfE4rlvaa	Just stay a friend to her for now, make sure that her and her ex are over before you make a move. You have no obligation to him what-so-ever, but it would be respectful to give them both time to heal, let the break-up run it's course. Don't tell her you "like her and are willing to wait" then she'll feel obligated in some weird way, and then you never know how she would truly feel about you. I can't tell you if she still likes him or not, only she knows that, and you can't really "read the signs" after a break-up because everyone puts a mask on, you never know how they really feel because they're too busy trying to cover it up. So, just sit back and watch, and when you feel the time is right, then go for it!|`|gOfxzZCBaa	Nobody can say whether she's ready for another relationship or not, only she can.  If you really like her, honestly, all you have to do is ask her out.  I know it's alot easier said than done.  But at the end of the day you'll get a "real" answer.  By all means go for it, what have you got to lose? nothing.|`|g7mD94cuaa	aww you seem sweet. Just wait a while. right now she hates him. but if he still likes her then chances are he will pull a move on her and chances are she will give in.|`|OMn4dxEaaa	ok well cause she has just broken up you should just become friends at first you know take it slow maybe 3-4 weeks when the time is right when she is open and has an intrust in you make a move hopeful this works but make sure you take it slow and comfort her though  hope i helped  lyshi|`|AA10178659	Forget about love, and try to concentrate on study.
TxsnvnrSaa	Well my parents and my g/f parents are divorced. We talk about it all the time but it doesnt effect us.     I think he just needs someone to talk to and someone who will listen. Maybe all u need to do is listen...be there for him! :)|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He just wishes he could have really known what it was like to have both parents in the same house. Honestly, he should be happy that they are not because just think of how bad it is. I am glad my parents divorced and never wish for them to get together again. I know very well what it was like with the two of them in the same room. Just tell him that your family is not perfect and that no one is. Your parents argue like parents do.|`|Vi2CCYTRaa	My parents have been divorced since i was five and i don't see how it could affect my relationships. But if his parents divorce really affected him then don't push him to hard.  Just be patient, if he really wants to talk about it with you then eventually he will. Just tell him that you will always be there if he needs a shoulder to lean on if he ever wants to discuss it.    As for your overall question don't treat him any different just because his parents are divorced silly!  It almost seems as your making a problem out of something that doesn't exist.  Good luck!|`|ba9aa8b3d71c1e710f4561957c0e0684aa	There is no way to "talk" him into learning to trust you. And I'm not sure that is the issue anyway.    Joking about your perfect family doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't trust you? I'm not understanding the leap here. You also don't say what "the problem" is?    Might you be creating an issue that doesn't actually exist?|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	Well imagine that your parents got a divorce   Once you know how he feels then try to talk to him about it.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	My parents got divorced when I was 8 so I actualyl remember the whole situation. And recently my mom told me that paying for the divorce was the best thing she's ever paid for. Now I am afraid of love, I'm afraid to get to know people really because I'm afraid that it will have the same ending as it did for my parents. I've promised myself one thing in life though and that is that if I ever get married and have children NEVER will I put them through everything that I've been through. It's just not fair. Your boyfriend is probably afraid that you'll both get hurt in the long run. I know this sounds really horrible but thanks to his parents your boyfriend probably doesn't know what to expect with love and what it really means. You should talk to him about it, try to understand more. And do try to realize that by having your parents still together that you have had a lot less mental scarring. Not that divorce makes you go crazy... but now 8 years after the divorce, I still cry over it. Just remember that he's been put through something hard and doesn't want the same thing to happen to you two I bet =)
ggfE4rlvaa	You sound like a great guy, and if she doesn't see that then tell her to screw off! Especially if she is seeing someone else. A woman with 2 kids shouldn't be bouncing around relationships, they need stability, she's obviously being selfish and not thinking of that. If you like kids, there is plenty of women out there who are single with kids that would appreciate you. Look at the bright-side..it's only been 5 months so you're not terribly emotionally attached, get out while you can, if she doesn't wanna see what she's got when she's got it..then she's not worth your time. Best of luck!|`|5pGfmlxcaa	if u think that then what are u waiting for?  yes she probley has another guy    untill then dude go and find a another girl untill that chick makes up her mind  u shouldnt wait for someone like that she prolly lost feelings for you   and now wants to be wiht someone else|`|gWXjNa4gaa	seriously, buddy, walk away. she doesn't like u. & if she did, she wouldn't be seeing anyone else|`|xklPs0Ldaa	um, walk away buddy. she sounds like shes using you.

Talk to her and soon, let her know that you don't appreciate this kind of treatment and she needs to let you know were she is standing in this relationship, and don't take "im confused right now" or "im not ready to get serious" because if she has any of those lame answers she is not worth your time guy, you need to just let her go and move on in life!! Don't be down on yourself, be confident in who you are as a person and just know if she is not the one for you there is someone out there for you, you will find love again just give it time!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!!|`|Dn8xd0Kuaa	i truly believe you should find yourself a girl that will respect and honor you like you deserve, DON'T EVER SETTLE FOR LESS! ...good luck to you guy|`|ChMTXl3saa	Find someone who has no kids. Her cup if pretty full.|`|x9PQQGybaa	wow i think she is using u as a therapist and a babysitter, maybe more..i think she is fake cuz she is not treatin u right only like maybe a sidekick.. if u really have true feelings for this girl then stay with her if u want.. but if u dont then leave her.. from wat it looks like she is no good..especially not for u and she is selfish.. maybe u should sit down and talk to her and really tell her how u feel.. it will work.. unless she doesnt give a damn and gets up and walks away.. if she does that or anything similar or just yell at u or talk bs then thats ur cue to kno that u need to leave her *** alone lol|`|ba9aa8b3d71c1e710f4561957c0e0684aa	You can't force someone to choose you. And it does not matter how much you want a relationship to exist, if the other party does not want the it, I can guarantee that no relationship will happen.    My question to you...why don't you find a woman who actually cares about you? A woman who loves you and asks you you about your day, etc. You are spending a lot of energy about a non relationship. Wouldn't it make more sense to put that energy into a real relationship?
xkgcYeXPaa	THAT WHAT YOU B*TCH!|`|ZlC654Dkaa	If you think a bad word justifies violence, then you'd be ok with your violence justifying him pulling out a gun and popping a cap in your @ss.  There are better ways of dealing with this abhorent racism.  Make a formal complaint or go to the media.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	no    troll|`|ebqQAzk1aa	Do you punch people that call your fat friends tubby?|`|k9c7MoyPaa	No that wasn't right, kinda cool but not cool. The waiter was a dick though. But still not right.|`|13uu4bbQaa	He so had it coming! Good job!!   Maybe that'll teach him a lesson not   to be rude!!!|`|AA12011409	u were drunk? u don even remba! lol..  ahh personally i don find fault with the N word.....  but yea if u care abt ur gf.....den u prolly did the rite thing  and besides its done....u cant change that now.....  so ur cool|`|TxsnvnrSaa	That's messed up! You had every right to punch that douche bag!|`|pX8qJzjIaa	thats definately ok, I would feel the least amount of remorse over that|`|eKVnsobDaa	No....violence is never okay.    The n-word is horrid, but that does not justify breaking someone's nose.|`|Vr6L81iiaa	Some people are not exactly with us in the 21st century where racism is highly unfavorable among the population. The *N-word* as you call it is unfavorable and disgusted among a lot of people. I personally do not believe it is right to use that word or any term that indicates a certain ethnicity for everyone deserves to be treated equal.   This waiter you speak of is probably uneducated in some ways and hasn't learned the ill use of words such as that and how hurtful it is to us of an ethnicity other than white.   Your intentions were good however you should have only used violence as a last resort. As you may have heard before, since many have spoken these words, violence is never the answer. I can understand the anger and loss of control that you may have experienced, it was probably a simple reaction. What you could have done is first take a deep breath and asked "excuse me?" If he says it again kindly explain that you do not like him to use that term against your girlfriends and that if he continues to use that term then you will file a complaint to the owner and leave the restaurant.
f1eMHsoLaa	Then she is your soul mate      and btw you're so sweet =)|`|mXwO9xmCaa	why r you not with her? is she flirty towards other guys cus that was a turn off for me had the same prob..|`|8WP9Gu1saa	Stop wasting your time looking for reasons. Follow your hearts desire and go for it, rather than be sorry in the end 'cause you didn't have the courage to tell her so.  Who knows, she's just waiting for your move, go before someone else get her.|`|UhK363oJaa	awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  that is the sweetest thing EVER!   dude i think your still iin love with her!! awwww! your so sweet!!|`|g7mD94cuaa	OMG your like the perfect guy. LOL If you are as sweet as you sound then you will have no problem at all getting her attention.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	The issue with this is she was your FIRST love, which means no matter what you do, you will have some kind of feelings for her! Whether 5 years down the road you are married and have kids, she will always be there! I recently went through something similar to this! I dated this girl for 3 years in high school and when we broke up i went through a great deal of depression! When that was said and done and i started dating, no one was as good as her! The only thing you can do is just keep dating around and try HARD not to compare them to her at all!|`|YoLI7onHaa	Tell her how you feel, she might feel the same way. Tell her you still think about her, even if your in a relationship your mind is still thinking of her.|`|61c63251ebea26e8537da54b1275504baa	just tell this girl how you feel.... Chances are she will feel the same way... And she shouldn't judge you or make fun of you for feeling this way becaus you guys have been best friends for a long time.... I've had something similar to this before and my guy friend confronted me about his feelings and I totally felt almost the EXACT same way! But unfortunately I can't be with him right now because I do have a bf...... But anyways you probably do feel hypnotized by this girl because you REALLY are!!! So I'd say go for her so you don't miss out on her and also so ur not sitting there wondering why you let such an oppurtumity pass......
AA12325447	Buy a book...I don't ever want to even discuss planning that crap again.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Your best bet would be either go to a website that deals with this or buy a wedding planner book.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Here's what you *need* to know:     -What is the procedure for getting a marriage license where you live?   -When and where will the wedding take place?  -Who will be officiating?    The rest is frills.  It's whatever you and your sweetheart want.  Whatever is important to you.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Find an online free wedding planner website there are quite a few out there.|`|N6rqPQL7aa	You can get a Bridal Consultant, or local wedding planner, just look in the yellow pages. Talk with other women that are in happy marriages for advice, a pastor's wife, etc. Also you can check out books on the subject at your local Library. But most importantly, Congratulations to you, I wish you the best, and make your planning a peaceful, joyous experience.
e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	no.|`|UspK4SQBaa	No.  She is an adult, and you are a child.|`|rurfFLDkaa	if u want but ur hella lucky to be makin out with a 22 year old at 16|`|3jwXB5araa	your 16 dude. but if you do remeber to use a condom!|`|hA6JDWsFaa	just because you consider yourself a "late bloomer" (which you really aren't) doesn't mean you should rush things. Take things slow as they come, no ones forcing you to do anything.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	Well it depends what you want..what relationship you want with her, if you havent gone out with her long enough maybe its just for the pleasure of sex which with some people is just what they want, if you want it to be more special i would say wait a bit and see if you fall in love with her....if your not in it for the relationship and want pleasure then i guess you could do it,..just use safety and enjoy, i suggest maybe some fore play on her since its your frist time maybe you wont last long but what do i know im just a 15 year old whos a virgin lmao|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Well, she's completely in the wrong if you ask me. 22 and making out with a 16-year-old? that's just wrong. Something is wrong with her dude..run away fast and find a girl your own age. Any 22-year-old (male or female) who is willing to sleep with (or even make out with) a 16-year-old, is seriously messed in the head.|`|Lef6vVQAaa	Go for it. Don't get too attached. Making out with her when she's behind bars would be pretty complicated.|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	uh sure, go for it homie|`|EHCM324Faa	well kiss is alright...but are you ready to have sex and is she?|`|ZbdvcKm2aa	do it and tell her your inexperienced  she will feel reaalllly comfortable if you say that and will difinitely fu** you|`|EeQ6qL52aa	if she's giving it up that easy ur best choice is to RUN LIKE HELL! I smell STDs!|`|sYSEYHAzaa	22 years old wow give urself a pat on the back... if u had sex with her it would be illegal... lol it would be really a dick moove to have sex with her then sue her for doing so and rake in a lot of money and lose ur virginity|`|5YCY2ANRaa	I say go for it; I know I would have. Just make sure to have safe sex because like you said, "she's experienced." About you kissing her, I see nothing wrong with that; it was only a kiss, and that is probably how she sees it too. If she is willing to go all the way with you, I say don't hold back...|`|WTq8h4IRaa	alright.  well congrats on the kiss.(:    anyways...about the sexx stuff. do it when your ready. people can say yeah go for it or no dont go for it but it depends on you and the way you feel. make sure you wont regret it later down the line. sexx is a big step. i would say just go with what feels right. if you feel lyk you want to have sexx with her then make sure your both ready and you too wont regret it later down the line.     i wish you luck.(:|`|rd1XUNinaa	Just because you guys kissed in no ways means that she is even considering wanting to have sex with you. The fact that this is your thought process shows that your not ready for sex.|`|NQH7aGHFaa	If you're asking that question, then no  Do it only if you're sure of what you're doing.    And you're too young anyways. She's an adult. Save yourself for your future wife, thats what i suggest|`|2OUUr1pwaa	do it man, it will change your life.
HkGSx0HIaa	Why did you lie in the first place?  I think you should tell him the truth and be honest with him for now on. If he seriously isn't in to you because you don't like the outdoors, then what does that say about what kind of person he is?  Do you really want to be someone who is so shallow?  I agree with the others, maybe there was more to it than that.  I think you should ask.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	I dont think he's that into you if he rejected you over something stupid like that, but i dont know how this boy is!|`|Nqns4I0laa	Well why did you do that in the first place? You maybe just needed to be yourself from the begining..I doubt a guy just wouldn't like you because you weren't interested in the outdoors and he was. I'm guessing there's another reason behind it.|`|bFd9HZ6Saa	You shouldn't start off a relationship with a lie. Tell him the truth. Trust me....
2Om1LosMaa	Valentines day is for sweethearts. Commercialism is driving your confusion. Also if you are not in a romantic relationship with her it could give her the wrong idea and complicate your friendship.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	get her some candy and tell her she better share it with you  don't make her anything or get candy in heart shaped box cuz she will think you looooooooove her and freak her out    tell her you got it for her cuz you felt sorry for her with no valentine and all  and you want the candy too|`|oLYFG25daa	Just make her a nice card... cut some pic of of a jewelery catalog stick on a piece of paper and write something like, for my best friend hope your charming gives you something great. love me    that hy your not sending signals but your giving her somethig|`|nyeUUojFaa	why dont u ask her|`|IrnHxv0iaa	If she is sending you signals then what you should do if you like her is get her a card and maybe a stuffed animal that says something like I luv you. But if you don't like her try to make a card that say to my bestfriend wouldn't have it any other way!|`|IEZr9yjhaa	Why not get her a nice card? Just make sure that it is not a lovey dovey one. A friendship Valentines day Card. That will work.|`|qdmi87Cgaa	i think you don't need to get her anything if your not that close..    and i think that valentine its lovers day not friendship day!!    only if my close friend don't have a bf i would get her something :)|`|oTbSjPXOaa	you might get some ideas by reading this http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...
0xgqJIZwaa	What am I like in the bedroom?  Playful and passionate. I'm up for almost anything! Role playing, sex games, new positions, etc. I also like to do it in other places other than the bedroom itself. I'm verbal meaning I tell him what I like, what I want him to do, I also give a pleasurable laugh if it's a very playful session.    What do I like?  A guy who can make MOST of the moves. A guy who swears in the bedroom. A guy who is verbal. A guy who is playful and passionate. A guy who is experimental.    What turns me on?  British men, beards and tattoos. Oddly enough, left handed men also intrigue me. I'm not attracted to American or French men at all in a sexual way, I don't know why. Also, watching a guy go to town on himself is quite the turn on for me.    Would I ever watch porn with my significant other?  Yes, it's fun.    What is my zodiac sign?  Cancer.    Sorry if I'm too honest, haha.|`|rEafx4QTaa	very intimate, i like to hold, i like to touch, i like to kiss. a girl that kisses me as much as i kiss her (all over) is very stimulating, during foreplay esp, but also during the act. when a girl talks dirty (not too crzy tho) is also a turn on.     aries    me and my girlfriend have a enjoyable sex life, so yes.  some pornos we'd laugh at, some would get us in the mood|`|qigjzA77aa	I just try to get it all out in the bed room. But I am not selfish. I have never had a good BJ so those turn me on right now, Doggie style BABY!    Yes, I have watched porn with my X gf    Capercorn    ******what about you?|`|7YHmkdfXaa	Im usually the aggressive dirty talker type. Im turned on by a woman who knows what she wants and is totally comfortable with herself. Im a Virgo.|`|8gWqRvJXaa	my bedroom personality would probably be schizophrenic, just cuz im in a different mood every night, sometimes i'll be romantic, sometimes ill be crazy...    im a Virgo, my boyfriends a Gemini, in horoscope world we should be totally incompatible and hate each other, in reality, we've been together for almost six years and i couldnt imagine being with anyone else...      oh, and no, porn is disgusting
z7JsVzcnaa	You're not dating anymore.  His talking to other girls is none of your business.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Obviously he's talking to this girl (whether he admits it or not) & probably about you. Maybe he's still hung up on you & shes telling him to get over you. Or maybe hes talking to another girl & shes telling him that the other girl isnt worth it.
384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	most guys are Territorial even though hes probably dating other girls deep inside he knows he only wants you to date him. Its a guy thing.|`|aF1IXKjTaa	DUMP HiM NOW!! before he hurts you deeply.|`|Okc9dlxmaa	could of been just curiosity bc he';s dating a lot other's and he just wanted to know how many other guys u are dating and could be possibly sleeping with.   or maybe he wants to make it official and he wanted to know how much competition there was.   or maybe he wants to drop you and just wanted to know if there was someone to catch u on the rebound.|`|ChMTXl3saa	Sit him down, look in his eyes and just ask him.|`|dQ21VvHUaa	soundsz like you needa leave.|`|gKa5rdNYaa	Have you ever seen Dane Cook Vicious Circle? He simply states when you cheat you always go through the others persons stuff and start getting suspious about them! This was more than likely this the same situation!|`|WNskx1JGaa	Dont tell him he sounds like a player and like he is trying to take advantage of you.  Just tell him in a nice way that that is your business and none of his.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	i think he want you all to him self. ask him if he wants you to stop seeing other guys. see what he says.|`|C28tF09Faa	you should have asked him why he asked you that question and answered it honestly. If its just him you're seeing, be truthful. Consult him as to the purpose of that question and encourage him to be honest and open with his answer to you. Good luck|`|d40k56HHaa	I think he was wanting to tell you he is seeing other girls and just didn't know how to bring it up
TKHA5okpaa	Thats funny because if her husband is coming home from Iraq  I'd bet you money she's probably posted the same question on  yahoo answers about what she should do for you!   I know your a guy and it might be difficult for you to understand but, I really dont think the first time is going to be the time for all the wierd positions and legs all twisted and body parts flying around.  Take it slow, kissing kissing kissing, and if you havent seen her in a while time matters so think about whatever gross hairy fat lady you have to to make it last.  Dont act like your trying to blow her mind this is not the time to make her call you daddy (maybe next time)  The best feeling for a woman is to see you looking at her, and acting like your hungry for her, not hungry for humping but hunger for HER.  So act like she's like the hottest stripper you've ever seen or something. That is the best feeling for a chic.|`|AA10423276	with a detonator hehehehe....  joking :P|`|K6vEbdqxaa	When you get home waste no time in completely ravishing her!  I'm sure she is chomping at the bit to do exactly the same thing to you.  I can't imagine being in the same situation and not wanting to just rip my man's clothes off and do him on the spot!|`|5k7BexD3aa	Same as before...after a few months, we fell into the bed and he hadn't even had a shower in 3 days.  LOL.  Trust me...after all the months of loneliness just seeing you and being able to feel you will be enough.
ggfE4rlvaa	Wow, he's REALLY into you, guys who are only in it for the sex, really don't do the cute stuff, or snuggle really. GO FOR IT!|`|4f1SbI0baa	Of course he likes you!!  He obviouslyy has some feelings for you. Ive been the same way with guys.. there was this guy who always kissed me and hugged and held me tight. After a while he asked me out but i turned him down because we became too close  of friends and i didnt wanna loose that. But my advice is to talk to him about you guys being official. Tell him how you feel.|`|oOGxok8vaa	yeah 100% if not murder me :P|`|5FkcD4ktaa	we end up "doing stuff" nudge nudge...  LOL your funny !    umm of cource he's into you girl !  have fun !  :)|`|dxo8DT55aa	Hint to him that you want him to ask you out, dw guys get these hints.  If he does not ask you out soon he might just like the idea of getting his once a week release.  3 months is a while ...    Good Luck|`|DzEXQ9Ydaa	All those things you said he does even made me smile! I can see why you would like him!!! He deff sounds into you.. I've never dated a guy that did those kinda of things if he weren't into me. *nd vise versa, really. I wouldn't do any of that if I weren't into a guy.. Would you?   If I were you I would hint around to him about Valentines Day. If he doesn't ask you to be his date, ask him. Sometimes you have to be straight forward with a guy. And guys can be just as shy as girls can be when it comes to those kinds of things.   And if you're that into him, you may as well ask.. What's the worst he could say? No? If so, then you will at least know what's going on...   And he could just want to know that you feel the same way...
TxsnvnrSaa	Well everyone has different ways with doing things. People cry and others move on quick. But anything is normal. I think you just need to stop falling so hard and so fast. Take time in relationships. Your 15....u have a lot ahead of u. Im 19 and i know. :)|`|UEDUvVxaaa	Sounds like you're lonely.  Hang out with some friends or try some new stuff to focus on other things.|`|CqpK9LC1aa	It's normal, honey.     It's all part of being a teenager and the hormones.     As for the falling in love part, I can't say that it's not love because I met my fiance when we were in 8th grade, began dating freshman year, & are now engaged to be married.     However, it may just be infatuation that you think is love. You'll find the right guy. Hun, you've only lived 15 years of life. You'll plenty of guys and you'll find your Mr. Right, someday.|`|TNKFfxsqaa	Its very normal especially this early in adolescence.  Its mostly your hormones raging. They will balance out and you will stop crying about situations like these in the future. Some call it growing up. You will eventually find a guy, besides you're only 15! you still have college and graduate school to find a man!   On the upside, guys grow up and you will grow up to. The guy you like may not be the guy you want in a few years.|`|2OUUr1pwaa	no that is not normal, show some skin guys like that .|`|qw19hBAYaa	yes, u don't need to be in rush girl.just wait for the right person at a right time.perhaps that guy is really not for you,you can find a guy better than him..|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Well I don't think you're old enough to have a boyfriend in the first place and I don't think you should cry but should find a hobby top keep yourself busy when you're free.|`|AA12142423	first of all... you don't fall in love.  secondly, you obviously haven't found the right person.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	It's normal.  Forget boys, and have fun !  You have your entire life to worry about men, but right now isn't the time.|`|d40k56HHaa	I wouldn't go back to being a teenager for nothing in the world not even to have that rock'n body I had way back when.|`|1FAggU5Zaa	very normal when ur 18 start worrying about it not now.|`|7eBuPdwQaa	Maybe it is, but maybe your focus should change.  Don't look to a guy for your happiness.  You need to know yourself first, know what you want in a guy when the time comes and don't revolve around any person at all.  Find who you are by finding connection with Jesus, then you have a chance of becoming more complete as a person before you try to become a couple with anyone.  Love is not a crush, even if it does feel like love.  Love is much deeper and you deserve to find it honestly and deeply.|`|Lp0l0PAGaa	ill be urs :)
7RyZ5fzlaa	That questions has one of the longest run on sentence that I have ever seen, but to get to your question she could like you. It sounds like you have a good vibe going between you with some good chemistry but you have to capitalize on it. Flirt with her, let her get comfortable then make your move. Any girl that will hang out with you until 4 am with you either REALLY loves talking to you or has a crush on you (so unless you are just the most interesting conversationalist around, she probably just likes you).
iw2cckG5aa	Well.... I would start by getting my head out of the clouds. You do not sound like you are ready for a boyfriend. Jr. High or high school probably. Concentrate on school that is most important.|`|ohIvx6rkaa	Let him do all the talking!   In other words, wait til he makes a move.  If he JUST broke up with some other chick...he may wanna be alone right now, so if you start chatting him up, you may push him away.  Just wait until he notices what type of girl you are and wait til he is ready to move on.  If all your girlfriends know you like him...and they all like him as well, really if they were really good friends....NONE of them would touch him.   But it's not a perfect world is it?    Good luck :)|`|rEafx4QTaa	get at him before they do|`|d40k56HHaa	He's hands off girl he was your girlfriends guy stay away if you want to keep her as a friend.  GIRLS CODE|`|rKsgGHKkaa	k then ask him out.  not rocket science buddy.
o0GPDE4Maa	Maybe just get a guy to go out and along with them, Or just sit her down and talk to her. You need to let her know how you feel.
C28tF09Faa	Go with your girl friends. have fun...    If you go alone, just keep thinking you're the hottest thing there and you don't care what anyone thinks of how you look...just try to have fun and the rest is gonna be easy.    Fun Fun fun...thats all you should be thinking about. Practice at home to a few of the songs you know might play at the dance so that when you hear them at the dance you can get busy...but fun fun fun    Good luck and you will have a blast dont think about it too much!!|`|wXp06yBEaa	First off you should ask someone because you know what, all they boys are having the same problem. Second, for me what works the best is focusing on how to ask someone and not worrying about that awkward encounter. Scavenger hunts are a traditional way of doing asking. Good luck!|`|TxsnvnrSaa	Man this is a tough question. I never liked dances...just go with friends and dance with some of you girl friends...that will build confidence|`|kMpgMplmaa	take a deep breate and go for broke. "the only risk in life you loose are the ones you dont take" think about it|`|HxQEmhf8aa	smoke a joint|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Dances are always..funner? when you have friends with you. Pick a friend and have her as your date! It'll be so much more relaxing and fun, rather than being all nervous next to a guy.   In general, if you want to build your confidence, go sit in front of the mirror every single day for 5-10 minutes and make a list of the things you like about yourself. Keep doing this, and after awhile, I'm sure the list will start growing longer and longer.|`|rEafx4QTaa	trisha and tia v got it. Dancin wit ur friends builds up confidence and u have a good time. trust me ppl are jus as shy as u are (guys i mean)|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	Ask a friend to go with you or go with a group of girls and you all can dance together as "girls night".|`|563a202d21b6ef1f2e6be958ccf13824aa	Take some dance classes, sports, martial arts    something that makes you feel good about yourself    that's how you build your confidence...    with hobbies and interests that are healthy, stress relieving and fun.
oKqWOeOiaa	depending on where you live ofcourse, go to the beach really late at night. there's no one in the lifeguardd houses & no one near the water at the beach. you can lay a blanket on the sand, or lay on the sand itself, or in the tiki houses with the mattresses. its very dark & romantic. most of the times there's no cops or anyone around. especially around 2am. just make sure your bf is armed just in case lol =p|`|gKa5rdNYaa	What i did when i was your age, which was about 4 years ago, i always went camping seemed to work for me! lol your still kinda in doors and secluded, cant get into trouble and its free!|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	go somewhere secluded, like a grassy area(park) and lay a blanket out and get busy! but dont stay and cuddle, u might get caught there too!!! lol|`|lg2RfcrQaa	Keep it real classy and try the park bench.    I'm not surprised your parents don't allow it. It's not your house it's theirs. You're not going to be this person for very long anyway. You can do all this "together forvever" crap to your heart's content but by this time next year you won't even be with him.|`|1KajpBdaaa	hotel|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Let an old horny business man at a hotel watch you guys in exchange for using his room for free.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Bathroom at the mall..or any public restroom or at the park.

Just be honest with him and politely turn him down.|`|Z6RfbYq5aa	This is the first date and you are trying to figure out is he a hitter or a quitter or not...because you did not feel a connection, that leaves me to believe that you seen something about him or maybe he said something that sort of decreased your interest in him...think carefully. He may have did something as slight as gestured wrong...  How was his appearance?...you know what they say the first impression always have to be the best one.

s4iVl04raa	If she got on top of you, obviously she knew what she was doing and what she wanted. If she is your friend, then you should talk to her about it. If she is interested in pursuing a relationship with you and you are not, then I would definitely tell her and explain to her why. If it's only because of her age, then you shouldn't have slept with her in the first place. Maybe she got the vibes from you that you like her and that's why she made a move.

Sometime the age of consent of sexual activity varies and you need to know.  The other thing to be aware of when you look up the age of consent is that some states have different ages for heterosexual relations than they do for same sex contacts.      If you are legal and you probably are, then what you do is up to you.  If you want a lover more your own age then you have an obligation to be both kind and honest.  If this is something you both are ok with then you can let it go.  I suspect it would die and natural death before too long anyway as your lives will be moving in different directions.    While probably not the best judgment getting it on with a 16 year old in most states she is old enough that you probably avoided any legal issues but you do need to do a web search for your state's laws    Best of luck.

If possible, Ignore her until she forgives u.|`|1niuAo36aa	girls hate whiny guys, apologize once but make it count.    Be non-reactive, non-needy.    To be in a 'mood' in the first place isn't a good idea when trying to attract women, and it'll stick out like a sore thumb in her head . . . .so you need to distract her from this particular event, nothing special because it them seems as if you 'need' something from her and your reacting heavily to the situation which you aren't  . . . right.    Just play it cool if you can, maybe say . . .    'i fancy getting out tonight, you can come to if you like, we could chat and chill out . .and i promise i'll be nice (cue the innocent smile) . . . if not thats cool too (then glance away)'    One thing tho dont say it facing her straight on . . mention it as if you side-by-side, shoulder to shoulder. if you say anything facing straight on she may become intimidating and feel as if you are forcing her to do something. it also focuses all the interest on her, which is a bad thing, play what ever you say cool, over your shoulder, it gives her a 'slice' of attention, no pressure . . .and she will listen to you and give u a more honest answer.|`|AA11736916	For one I want to say that I'm sorry . So you and her have been friends ( a very long time by the way you act/talk). Just write down what happened that day to you and how you felt, then after you do that think about what you said to her. Now get in a room to yourself (silent) and think about how you feel about her, how much she means to you, and what all she has done for you/your family and whatever else you feel like you want to. And now write  to her and apologize some and then tell her everything that how you feel about her and what she means to you and all that and apologize again.  But when you talking to expressing yourself let it be just the two of you. And maybe it can be at a nice place/museum or park or a candlelit place .  And bring her something nice that she likes that you know that she likes or make her something coming from your heart.    And maybe watch a movie or go for a nice romantic walk and then sit down and look at the stars and listen to some soft music and call that radio station ahead of time and dedicate a song to her and tell her on the radio that you're sorry.  Just always have hope,faith and love. I wish you the best of luck and i hope things work out.|`|ppdyd3jEaa	lol sam desperate are u not?

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	The divorce proceedings between your wife & you are still pending in the court & you want to remarry with another woman, that too under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 where the very first condition for valid marriage is unmarried status of both parties. Although in India the simple affidavit with regard to unmarried/divorcee/widow/widower status along with Decree of divorce/annulment or Death Certificate is sufficient, but for similar civil marriage in foreign country the Bachelorhood Certificate is required which is issued by proper government authorities of those countries. The very fact one month notice has to be given for any civil/court marriage under the above mentioned Act, is basically to ascertain the unmarried status of both parties to marriage, any information about any of the party being already married will stop the whole process & the Marriage Officer being authorized under the Act can proceed for filling criminal complaint against the party for the offence of perjury who filled false affidavit stating his or her unmarried status. To say that the second marriage to take place outside the State is possible or not, yes it is possible if the fact of the first marriage is not get exposed which is very much possible as the Notice of marriage both present as well the permanent address of both parties has to be mentioned where a copy of the notice is sent to the Marriage Officer of that district for investigation of the fact about the unmarried status. The objection with regard to the civil/court marriage under the Act can be filled by the first wife & reference of the court proceedings can be given to get the marriage stopped from being solemnized. Even by chance the second marriage is got solemnized, the husband committing bigamy will be liable for punishment under section 494 I.P.C., here the proof of his first marriage & the second marriage will not be difficult to prove for getting him behind the bar, if the first wife or her close relatives so desire. To get remarried by conversion to Muslim religion is also not advisable as held by the Supreme Court of India that in order to remarry change of religion will not validate the second marriage nor it will prevent the husband from being prosecuted & punished if found guilty for the offence of bigamy.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	u cant remarry before getting a legal Divorce..why cant u wait till divorce.  have some patience.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	I think you cannot marry another girl until you get divorce from your present wife.

Relationships are based on a mutual love and respect for one another, apparently your boyfriend never learned that and its time for him to learn it now!!

You need to give him an ultimatum its YOU or THE OTHER GIRLS but he can not have his cake and eat it too!! Love and respect yourself enough to know you deserve better and don't settle for less, if he can not appreciate you and love and respect you then someone will come along that will!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!! Remember a guy will only go as far as a woman lets him!!!
MEZ9hoRTaa	a woman may throw  a sign that she is interested by playin with her hair, eye contact, body language is facing the man etc. she is sending the signals for the man to make the move,,,  the man can make a move by asking her personal questions like is she single, throw a little compliment, and "vibe" with her.   Then finally one of the two asks the other if they want to go  that day or that weekend. and the other reciprocates with a phone  |`|79E3xHl7aa	"Men love when women are more aggressive and wild in bed,"  It shows that you're hot for him." Periodically let your inner animal out and turn your guy on to some seriously animal sex action as u like.     Putting a little muscle into your sexual organ is as much about attitude as it is technique. So from the very start, you need to make sure your man knows who's boss. Set action with a must-have-you-now lip-lock: Push your lips into his and grab a bunch of his pubic hair and pull as you're playing tonsil hockey.   "The scalp is loaded with nerve endings, so tugging on his hair releases feel-good endorphins,"  "Instead of causing him pain, it will actually feel pleasurable to him." Then proceed to treat your guy to a rough massage as you like, rub, and trail your nails over every inch of his body specially in vagina...and don't be afraid to use a little force. "Men's skin tends to be thicker than women's, so they can often handle  and want  more n more pressure,"      That tough-love technique applies to his manhood as well ; his testicles demand more delicate attention). "Most women assume that men's genitals are as sensitive as their own," "But many men actually prefer a firm grip when they're being manually stimulated. ask him to let you know just how rough he wants you to get the next time you're heading south for some lusty manhandling.     Another rough move: Tell your guy that you want him to take you from behind. But don't make him do all the work. Move your pelvis back and forth in sync with his thrusts, so your bodies are slapping against each other when they make contact.     You can even be a little brutish with him in the usually tame missionary position both start oral sex with each other, We were having sex with me on top, and all of a sudden she grabbed my butt cheeks, squeezed them tight, and pulled me so close to her. It was like she wanted my whole body to be inside of her. Then she started swatting my behind anal rocking...hard ****! It actually hurt a little, but at the same time it was pretty exciting!"enjoy everything u think,there r many move that can u move easily there is no limit enjoy forever....long lasting....unforgotable...|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	It's  not  your  place  to  make a  move,  that's  for him  to  do  and  if  he  doesn't,  then  despite  what  you may think,  he's  just not  that into  you.  You  have  to  accept  that.  Don't  become  masculine  and  get  all  aggressive  and  take  things  into  your own  hands.  I've  never  met  a  guy  who  hesitated  to  come  after  me,  if  he  likes  you  enough,  then  he  won't  let  anything  come  between  you 'n  him.  he'll  want  to  snatch  you  up  before  some  other  guy  beats  him  to  you.|`|sYxtPBziaa	From small talk you could easily move in and talk about your life and ask them a few questions get to know them better, ask them to hang out sometime and then your set.

NUWdgQuraa	If you doubt, it's because you have a good reason.  No one can control someone else, and manipulation is bad.  Just be yourself, get your act together if it isn't already, communicate with her, and see what happens.  Whatever will be, will be.
FyhzmgRUaa	The question is, what would you're reaction be if he does like you? he probably feels closer to you because of something that you may have said or done to make him feel at ease, or he could possibly like you. Ask him if he's interested in anyone, and if he say's yes, play the guessing game with him..... ask him to give you hint's as to whom it might be, and hopefully you'll find some answers.|`|kQufRZDjaa	if he looks at you alot ...and i mean ALOT ..he likes you
BPtnDLu3aa	Ignore her until    1) you've completely over her and if you were to see her with another man, there would be no sense of jealousy and you'd just feel happy for her.    2) she realizes that breaking up was retarded and wants to get back together.    This is the fairest way for you and for her too. v_V  No one goes right away to friendship after a long term relationship ends.|`|aEonduUUaa	It depends on her really not u|`|EHCM324Faa	Well I think she has a comfort with you she feel like her self with you so when you not talking to her it kind of bother her. Just tell her that she giving out some wrong impressions. And see how that goes|`|8j0KDb27aa	Keep ignoring her.  She will come around when she realizes what she had.  She obviously misses you already.|`|U51C3LCIaa	It depends on how you feel about her, really. Do you want to get back with her, or just keep your distance?    I would suggest continuing the casual talking, but do a little less of it. It will drive her nuts that you're not talking to her, making it appear that you're just 'too busy'. If she loves you and wants to be with you enough, she'll let you know.|`|EJ4pjDhFaa	I think you need to give her some time to figure things out.  Don't just stop talking to her, if you see her in the hall, share a passing glance or say 'hey'. But whatever you do, don't seem clingy and desperate. Let her know that it was probably for the best to just work out personal problems rather than going on with a cracked relationship. Maybe take her to see a movie, as friends. Just make sure you don't do the whole no contact thing, because that may give her the wrong signal. She may think that since you have moved on so fast, she should as well. Good luck.
kX14PGRcaa	i think sage & ivory are a nice combination.  i went to a wedding on june 1, 2008 and the colors were sage & ivory and it was beautiful.|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	I would do the black & white very classic and timeless. Use the pink as an accent. Have your flowers in shades of pink, If you have color in your bouquet rather than just white it will stand out better in photos.|`|0MnTXjn8aa	try not to do pastels they are to light. you are better off with darker colors so you stand out more. pink is nice, they have differnt shades of pink.(see if they have a darker pink). and i think black looks so nice in wedding parties.    congrats on your big day!|`|vJwl2uoBaa	bright pink and green..I went to a wedding show recently and these colors looked awesome together.|`|BZev127daa	I don't see why you can't use black especially as a trim color and especially at an evening wedding.  Have you considered orange, which is quite popular now and, or perhaps yellow? Take a look at some of the summer prints available also. Pinks can be lovely, but be sure not to go too light, or you may want to add a deeper sash or some other splash of color. Other wise light pink may look almost white. Also when choosing your flower color remember that though flowers add beauty to any wedding. During the  reception flowers get put aside and so the color they add to the bridesmaids attire  will be mostly lost after the ceremony.  There is a nice color match tool at Davids Bridal site, (I have no afiliation with Davids bridal) You may want to check that out.  Good Luck
7g8UHUJgaa	well...i have been broken hearted and broke hearts.    a year ago, my guy friend (also my best friend) said he loves me.     i said nothing.    he started saying it on the phone. i said yeah.    he thinks i do not love him...i am just not ready to say it.    i havenot told him that, but this Valentine's Day i hope it comes out.    sometimes people just are not ready to say it.    some people love you as a friend but hopefully you can tell.    my guy friend (the whole year) probably tried to think of other girls, but the more he thought of them, the more he thought of me.    try to move on. or wait.    it took me a year to realize how much i was loved by him...though i had liked him before he said he loved me.    and now i know i love him because he loves me for who i am.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Take the hit and move on.|`|R4MXqBHhaa	MAKE THEM LOVE YOU!!

M63kq3AYaa	I'm in a similar situation, all you can do is take the anger from you saying no, or get harsh with her and tell her she's out of control with her anger, that she has no right to get angry because you disagree over something.  If you agree with her to keep her quiet, your troubles will be a lot worse.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	tell her in your eyes you dont see a fat girl you see a gorgeous amazing girl with a great personiality and the girl you love. suggest that if she really doesnt feel confident about her body go run and exercise with her/.|`|59CaFeS8aa	She is still your girl friend and so waht abt the fat and all...|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	Tell her she has a mental problem about her weight issue, and to get over it cuz your tired of listening to it.|`|MRwb4jQYaa	Every girl is like that, but sounds to me like she's just fishing for compliments.  I would just ignore her comments and tell her you love the way she looks and that if she's not happy with herself, then she can always do something about it.  It's not like she has to stay "fat".|`|50pKPrHxaa	I think this is kinda hard for you... just be patient and be honest. maybe that is not only the problem. some self esteem problems has deeply rooted causes. try to find out what are these. you may also ask her best friend or mom why is she like this.    Good luck remember be patient...|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	She is angry because she thinks you are lying.  This is a no win situation or question.  If she thinks she is fat, then she is fat, but you strongly disagree amd empirically see that she is not fat.     Women accuse men of lying especially when they are telling the truth.  It is part of their neuroses.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	every girl is like that ...|`|HlzL6sdqaa	Yeah I have the same problem. I've just started saying, because I was sick of fighting about whether she was or not. I just say, "You know what I think" and then i generally roll my eyes playfully at her.    She usually goes "grr!" but is then fine and changes the subject.|`|81J81DGqaa	Tell her she's not and that she stops saying that or else...You decide. :P Or just take her picture and find a picture of someone fat and compare. If you won't do anything, she'll find eventually stop.|`|8f7499c9305e3e0c3d2784e92308020caa	alot of girls say that just because their unsure so they need someone to keep telling them so they can get back in the world.  no whatever you do DO NOT say your fat that would like make her kill you lol. just tell her either way you'de love her|`|wGQvgeXDaa	Look her in the eye, and tell her "I love you just the way you are". That should settle it. If she keeps nagging just keep quiet and smile.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	it's a catch 22. if you say she not fat, she will say you've got to say that.but if you say she fat then you hurt her feelings. you can't win. you need to give up or put her in her place.|`|c5cd0335ee42a5ea6e90bf0c236232e4aa	start by telling her that you love her fat or thin, tell her the is a difference between being fat and healthy, fat is some of the people that appear of biggest loser, but if she is well figured alround and you are happy with the way she is then tell her that you want and appreciate her the way she is full, you love cuddling and enjoying all that she is, you do want to feel just skin and bones, you dont wanna be injured whilst making love to her or even hugging and cuddling her, her beautiful figure is what keeps you happy and lustful only for her. tell her if you wanted a skinny boney babe you would have joined a science lab or become a doctor where you could hold and cuddle a skeleton constantly. remember also most people have hidden problems and when it begins to trouble them then they start to see the negative side of themselves and even start seeing faults with the way they look even if there isnt one, so try getting her to talk to you about whats really bugging her and if she is not comfortable opening up to you, dont be disheartened by this, just get her to talk to someone else friends, family members or even perhaps a shrink cause it could be something really deep. hope this helps you and good luck and keep you love for her strong even try spoiling her mentally and physicaly|`|eMtH8IAwaa	no..this is hurtful. she may have self-esteem issues, and needs the help from you to feel good. just be patient. and honest|`|9ybVTCcnaa	Tell her that you love her just the way she is.|`|QGQV9hvLaa	compliment her on random occasions to make her feel better about herself.

She emailed a friend to set a date to get together, because it was easier for her have the date set through email than having someone say "I'll call you".    So, like your friend, perhaps this is just an easier way of communication, or avoidance, either way, if she emails you, actually set a day to get together! Instead of saying "next week" say "Thursday, at 6:00PM" and say where as well, of course. If she can't, she'll let you know.      However, if it takes weekds to get together because she emails/facebooks you, and doesn't check to see if you've replied in time, just tell her not to contact you via the web unless she plans to check it to see if you've responded.    It's not rude, persay, it's just a lifestyle that she's adapted.|`|Dlfbgkv6aa	uh, what's your question really? uhmm are you expecting for a yes or no... to answer your question: is this rude?    if that's it... i'll say.... no.    maybe she's just busy, u know. maybe text her and ask her why she doesn't call you, or answer your call...    and the next step is to wait. =]|`|8bplNvAQaa	NO, if:    she really can't afford it (she must be at school or something and get free texts).  I used to text more when i was at school.  If not then:      YES, if:    Its an attention thing - The SMS and facebook gives her validity in her social life.      She'll get the text and think, "oh, I've got a friend" (even though she knows its you).  Same with facebook.  When she's in a social situation and is texting it makes her look popular (not necessarily the case, but you know what I'm getting at).    She likes the feeling of getting the SMS and emails and showing people around her (even if it's just her mum/ housemate/ boyfriend/ husband) that she has a social life.    Unfortunately she's not living that social life that much (probably because the thought of it's better).    Sad, but maybe true.  I prefer phone calls at less than a pound a conversation it hardly breaks the bank.|`|qjY1fqMIaa	i don't think it's rude. i hardly ever call my friends, and yet i still manage to hang out with most of them every few weeks. we usually coordinate hanging out through myspace and texting. i prefer texting because then we're not playing phone tag half the day.

a984cQjKaa	here's an idea-GET OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND GO MEET SOME PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE.  get a hobby that appeals to men and women.  and stop looking; the smell of desperation is not attractive.  be confident, and the ladies will come to you.|`|6eKqfXkwaa	try a BINGO SITE =/|`|hIk0lWT2aa	Ok, I'm not saying this with intent to offend, just remember that! Anyway, aim low. Don't just look for someone who is **** hot, coz normally the nice ones look pretty average. Talk to every girl you meet, and smile lots, and one of those girls will take an interest, don't let her get away. Keep chatting, and when you have to part, make sure she leaves with your mobile/cell number. Good luck hun!
8bplNvAQaa	Stop being so possessive of her.  She's your best friend but that doesn't mean she can't have others.  In fact she'll open a whole new social environment to your current friends.  Get out there, life's too short to spend with the same people your WHOLE life.  Meet as many people as you can and keep the ones you love close.  It will make life so much fuller later on when you're less social.  She's still your friend.    Maybe tag along sometime so see who these "others" are.    It's not as if she's lying and hangin with other people is it.|`|n4gnjjhCaa	the world is not only full of your little circle get out and meet others.  and dont bover with her if she dont, want to know you say all the best.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	You can't control her.

A5nkaq7Yaa	Just talk to her more. Sounds like you guys have fun talking to each other. Just keep the conversations interesting, don't make yourself sound like your trying to hit on her, make her smile. Stuff like that. Next time your with her...just go for it...start small...touch her hands...and keep on moving little by little...until you go for a kiss...if she goes along with it...she likes you...there's no downfall to it...  Hope it all goes great!|`|aIDlKCQAaa	Yea she might! so you gotta make your texts count! but i would maybe just call her one time like if your in the area and ask her out to coffe and usually if shes busy she will suggest another day and if she does then she is interested in hanging out but if she doesnt then she isnt sorry man move on.|`|2f26fcdfc1c8b468a66c330a0d519a3faa	stop texting.start chating FaceToFace.eye contact make ppl talk more but texting can't do that.just b cool and b yourself ,try not too nervous,just like talking to a friend .that will show u not too needy n col.|`|BGtkSLaKaa	Yes.

I don't think anyone should be FORCED into marriage...cousin or otherwise.|`|d08rkYlpaa	In Australia, marriage with an ancestor or descendant is prohibited, such as a parent with their own child, or a marriage between a brother and a sister.   It does not prohibit cousin marriage. No state or territory of Australia prohibits cousins from marrying.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_la...    Forced marriages in Australia are against the law. The Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) is an act of the Parliament of Australia which governs legal marriage in Australia. Part III entitled void marriages establishes the circumstances in which a marriage is void.

Marrying your first cousin isn't going to actually cause a problem. So you don't have to worry about your future children, just about the fact that it seems to sadden you.     If, however, your family has a history of marrying first cousins, then it will cause a problem. There is a community around where I live, and they have been marrying second cousins for several generations (the community is small enough that that's as far as you can get). Their incidence of birth defects has risen noticeably, and that just with second cousins.    And as far as I can tell, Australia allows cousin marriage (the US seems to be the only country where it is illegal), although many churches ban it. Are you entirely sure that you have no where to go if you refuse the marriage? A woman's shelter would take you in, and help you gain skills to support yourself if you so wish.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Run away! Genetically you are asking for trouble. Try Mendels laws of inheritance.|`|JXw0U77aaa	I personally think it's not ok...I'd say it's never ok to marry someone you're that closely related to.  It's always good to branch out in the genetic pool.      Why is it that the only way you can escape it is to run away?  That doesn't seem right; forced marriage is never ok.  Not even in Australia.  I'd report such a 'forced' marriage to the authorities; they can get you help and find you a place to live if need be.|`|la28Sd9haa	I think it is ok if you truly love the person and can handle the problems that will come across with you being 1st cousins.

Good luck|`|aihdbyDAaa	sounds like he's just leeching on you.  talk to him, seriously.|`|AA10128876	your situaiton sounds like mine about 20 years ago when i married my - husband with whom I just recently divorced, except mine worked and had a great job, but lied,about anything and everything, he w ouldn't pay the bills, I still to this day have   no clue on what he did with the money he made,I highlly recommend going to marriage counsling , the both of you, on his lying, you have to get this fixed if you love him and want to stay married to him, all the other stuff you  mentioned is a big deal of course, but I take marriage very seriously, and my divorce has left me so hurt emotionally, because I loved my husband so much and I never insisted on marriage counsling, which I r egret so much, so i stayed in a lonley marriage, where I was lied to, in debt, we had filed b ank rupsey twice, had one forclosure, and between the two of us, we made over 140,000 a year, there was no reason for all that to happen, I  just didn't put my foot down, So my advise to you is to get out as fast as you can or do something about this a fast as you can and help your marriage by going to a marriage counslor,now i've only been divorced 5 months, but I get alimony, I cant work do to a back injury, but for the first time in 20 years, I do not have to worry about money, why? because I am a good money manager and don't have him spending all of it on god knows what, and by the way, I had worked through out  17 yers of our marriage,in the medical field, so I did'nt want you to think I never worked, I did,and I was a hard worker, anyway, good luck, please take action, there is no reason to waste  your life, I feel 20 years was one big  lie in my life. take care.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	I agree with the person who mentioned the recession.  I don't know what he does, but business is very slow everywhere.  Are you sure it's not that?|`|uoEfoI7aaa	its time to lay down the law....  tell him to get off his lazy *** and do some work...help around the house and go look for a frekin job.  If he refuses then kick his LAZY *** out!|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Its hard to have a relationship with someone who lies, especially one who built the life you have on lies.  If he is not willing to make changes tne you need to make a move, whether it be counceling, separation or divorce. A real man should not let you work your hands to the bone while he sits around doing nothing to provide.|`|AA10248966	He has serious depression . He either needs psychiatric help and evaluations for this and Other disorders, ply us medication, or else, a quickie divorce/.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yep, get out before he drags you into financial ruin. It is a reason for divorce. And divorce on those terms so that can be taken into consideration in case he tries to drop some debt on you now.   If you do love him, let him sort himself out and prove himself to you before continuing another relationship with him.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Clearly he's worried because of the credit crunch. He has had a good income for a while but things are tough and clearly he doesn't want you to worry. Also men have a lot of pride and it'll take a lot before he admits that things aren't so good.     You can tell him that whatevers wrong you'll stand by him if you mean it or that you married him and you want to know whats going on and he shouldn't lie to you. If he's in trouble you should put the house in your name so that debt collectors can't take it from you.    Goodluck|`|gRW5X4vZaa	NO!!!!  Do not automatically jump to a divorce. That is never the way to solve things & you will have mental and emotional scars. You also didn't mention if you have any kids--- but trust me, from a kid's perspective, it would kill them to see their parents split over something like money.  Yes, he lied to you and, yes, that was bad, Go to a councilor and see if they can give you any help. Explain how you feel to him and that you have lost a level of trust.   Talk it over, Communication is the key tool in a relationship.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Your not actually that naive are you?    It's so easy to fall in love, It's so easy to fall in love!|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Well, divorce depends on alot of things.  How do you feel about it?  Do you love him?  Do you love him enough to get through it?    Divorce is always a last resort in my mind.  When we take a vow, "for better or for worse" it means just that.  Not "for better or for when you are lazy and don't do housework".    But things are different for everyone.  No one deserves to be unhappy.  And it kind of sounds like he is taking advantage of you.|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	I wouldn't rush into a divorce like that, try going to marriage counseling or tell him that you're seriously thinking about leaving him over it. If he still doesn't respond then think about divorce.|`|AA11289793	Well maybe he just wanted to impress you and he took it too far, or something went wrong that he didn't tell you about. So yeah this would be grounds for a divorce, but did you marry him becuase you loved him or becuase of his money, if it was the latter then depending on the person that is going to annul your marriage you might have a hard time getting it through...|`|zoH6rMCPaa	My dear woman, you sound just like my blasted wife.    Why should your husband help with the housework? This is a womans job! How dare you even suggest such a thing.    I am the head of my household and my wife is very fortuate to be a part of it.    It is now apparent that you only married him because you thought he had money, and now your realise he hasn't you want a divorce.    The trails and tribulations we men must face!|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Gotta be honest here.. your in a marriage, it's not him and you, each a completely seperate being. It's a together thing, and if he's going through something, you need to help him, encourage him, get him to step up and change/fix whatever's going on as a couple to get the financial stress going.    PS. Your married, your credit is considered in the same pot sometimes.     Maybe he's depressed or something, ask him to attend councelling by himself or even better, as a couple. Get that guy moving, sounds like he's down on his luck and doesn't know what to do next|`|lHiPygmqaa	Well , I think you should tell him to get his act together or you will get a divorce , my dad use 2 do the same thing and every time I found out he was fired . My mother told me they are divorced now but for different resins.|`|loy04C98aa	Depends on what matters to you.  You really have to ask yourself why you married him in the first place.  I think you also have to ask whether he lied to you or whether circumstances have changed, it really makes a difference to the outcome of your thinking.    If he truly outright lied to you than the answer is very simple.  Yes, leave him.  Your marriage isn't based on honesty or trust and thus doesn't have a strong foundation.  Hard to build from there.    If on the other hand circumstances have changed, remember for many of us this is true, I think you have to ask a different set of questions and then set some expectations for yourself and for him.  But if it is simply circumstances have changed, well I wouldn't just leap for the divorce papers yet.    So assuming that it is circumstances and not an outright lie.    You will need to sit down and have a open and honest discussion with him about what is going on and how it is affecting you personally and your marriage.  He needs to come clean, about the bills, about his work / income situation, about his past business.  You need all the details.   Once you have all the details, together you can come up with a plan.      First question I would ask is why he isn't actively looking for work, any work.  After that I would tell him that he must do so.  For your marriage to have a chance of success he must show an interest in working together and this means contributing to household success.  If he is unwilling to do this immediately, starting now, than I would say it is time to seek alternative living choices.    Next the bills.  Hopefully you don't share any debt at this point.  Make certain that all debt is in his name that was previous to your marriage.  Until such time as he is working and contributing, take him off any shared bank accounts.  Might sound harsh I know but you need to protect yourself.  If necessary open a new account in your name only and start direct deposits to this new account.  Tell him you are doing this to protect your future.  He needs to contact all his creditors and tell them he is unemployed and without income, your income doesn't count and they can't touch it legally once you take his name off any accounts.    Sharing in the upkeep of the home, especially when he is not working.  He should be taking primary responsibility and he needs to understand this.  If he doesn't think this is his burden have this discussion in honest terms, as long as you are the only breadwinner he needs to take on the role of house husband, this means housework; all of the day-to-day stuff.    So should you run for the divorce papers, not quite yet.  But shortly if you don't like the outcome of your discussions.|`|a984cQjKaa	uh, yeah.
fUv45LQwaa	i guess you could try to be a little patient and wait to see how it goes.  if not, you could try asking other friends about why your friend is so cold to you? they may be able to ask your friend what happened and tell you. then u can work on it. or you could just go up to her and ask what's going on. cause maybe it was a misunderstanding, and you could sort it out with your friend.  anyway, good luck in trying to figure it out. and hope you get back together soon!|`|2XTkSV4daa	Hey that happens sometimes, for two reasons.  1) You've been hanging on him a little and he's annoyed.  2) He thinks the same thing about you!  The best solution in either of these cases is to just lay low a little, say something to him and see if he responds well, if not you can ask him, Hey what's going on, are you ok?  But definitely don't push him.|`|PwnQuNnKaa	I think you maybe had do something that had annoyed he.but you didnt aware of it.

My fiance and I used to argue daily, then it went to about once a week, now it's rare. It took as a while, but once we started working on it the arguments were easy to avoid. We started by telling each other what made the other mad or how to handle the situation when we do get angry.|`|OSPDIm3yaa	honey if that continue for years,i mean right from day one till after one child and still happen,hnnmm then i think as a woman listen to him,and stop aguing out his opinion,try understand what he agui about and be a listen woman,then if he sees changes,then he will come dawn to u also,that is if u love each orther,cos i marry mine but i dint love her.i do out of presure,the worst part of it,she does make me angry every day,does things that make me sad.so knows what he wants and hate and he will subject to u,try it|`|EENUWAP7aa	listen to your heart, but follow your mind to clear pastures.    When a person gets caught up in a sexual relationship and has nothing else in common, the sex will drop the relationship fades.    If a person has a wonderful relationship then the sex will increase, and the relationship will sail.

Ea6TnOuOaa	The attraction between boy and girl is too immense to break apart yet your bf wants to go away from you means either he is saturated with this relationship or he has some problems with you.  The reason he puts it down to study is less believable because study takes back seat when a boy falls into a relationship with a girl.  I think, it would be ideal to leave him to be himself and not contact him.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	If you would like to maintain a friendly relation with him ,then keep in touch...|`|wE2etBzbaa	No, but you should keep in touch with your English teacher.|`|a984cQjKaa	you should take the time you were focusing on him and use it to improve your grammar and spelling.|`|R2WR8hRvaa	I Say If You Want Him In Your Life Keep In Contact, There is Always A Change That He Will Want You Back.

4qL7oRrVaa	Make sure things are set up with your Dad's place, that he knows you want to go there.    Then tell your mother one night over coffee/tea or something, and tell her your reasons why you want to go.    If you are reasonable, mature and have solid grounds for wanting to go, there's no reason why she should be upset about it too much other then missing you when your gone.|`|odR5CRWsaa	It is only natural to feel you want to move to your dad's.  My children did when they were 13.  It was a life changing event for me.  I felt it was for their own peace of mind, yet we didn't argue a lot.  A little, but that was only because of them disobeying their curfew.  You know, little things like that.  I cried every time I dropped them off at their dad's.  But I knew they thought they were missing something.  A totally different reason for you though.    So, you have to realize your mother will try to prevent  you from leaving.  You can even try to make her see that some people at your age leave for college at that age.  There are going to be hurt feelings, but she will have to deal with it.  Be prepared for more fighting.  You are an adult now with responsibilities and you have to concentrate more on your school if you decide to continue.  Too many other pressures that arise.  Your mom shouldn't compllicate the issue.  She is losing control of her little girl.  Let her vent.  You'll be gone soon.    You will still have to deal with your depression and momentary sadness.  But, you will be able to deal with daily pressures with a clearer head and get on with your new life.  Your brother & sister will always be there for you because they look up to you.  You can tell her the way you just told us.  Don't blame her for arguing or yelling at you.  Accept the blame if it starts to develop into an argument and just know that you won't have to deal with that type of  'abuse' daily.  All the best to you.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Be honest and tell her that you don't want to argue and fight with her all the time and want to go live with your a while.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Telling one of your parents you no want to live with them is always a hard thing to do  Sit down with her and just say that you don't think that you staying in the same house as her is a good idea, and that you would like to live with your dad|`|hGqgGkoOaa	Pack up and leave... say seeya on the way|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	I'm kinda in the same situation but not as serious.

ElBIeRFNaa	get your marriage certificate EARLY!  my hubby & i got married on 2.23.02 and we went 2 days before and the place was PACKED!  expect long lines.      just have fun!  congrats!|`|3ccacc540edb8d292ca1dabc548ee002aa	Also, beyond all the documentation and pointers mentioned, remember how this is going to affect your friends and family that weren't at the wedding. *Unless you don't feel you will have that situation.  Make sure to take a lot of pictures and perhaps have a reception when you get back so your loved ones can get involved as well.|`|8sJQP3Y4aa	Make sure you have a reliable camera or photographer to take pictures. My 1st marriage was in Vegas and of course it was just me and him.  My dad let me borrow his camera and I took it to a photo shop for them to load the film and they loaded the film incorrectly.  We took tons of pictures only to discover when we returned that not one picture came out.  We didn't have any pictures to remember the day.  So, since you're eloping make sure that you have a good camera or have a professional photographer to take your pictures.  Good luck to you and congrats!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Keeping a secret like this is really hard, when you are so excited!  Good luck!|`|VpCtXEMGaa	be sure to bring current or valid identification. if you've dissolved a marriage in the last 5 years, they may want to see divorce papers. Be prepared to stand in line for quite a while, because Vegas is the wedding capital of the world. And congrats.

Don't allow that green-eyed monster to destroy your relationship.  Don't allow that feeling of insecurity to gnaw at you.      Build a home he loves coming back to instead.  Fill it with warmth, love and happiness.  And when he calls you, inject tenderness in your voice; that should make him wish he was home with you.    Good luck!|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You wouldn't even post this question if you did trust your husband.  It is easy for any person in any circumstances to be unfaithful if they want.  Maybe the chances are slightly increased but there has to be the inclination.  Why don't you call the hotel without announcing it and check his whereabouts just to give yourself peace of mind.  However it will only tell you that he has checked in, it will say nothing about how he is spending his time.  If you really can't bear the agony of mistrust, make a surprise visit and stay with him for a night.  There's no reason why this cannot be a regular occurrence.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	Why do you think your partner is lying to you? has he lied to you before or has done anything for you not to trust him?  you see trust is a very important aspect of any relationship, if he hasn't given you a reason to doubt him, then i don't think you should. If he told you the details of where he is staying then he is probably honest.|`|2NUJsWIoaa	My husband cheated on business trips abroad. I wish I had realised that it happens a lot.I think you should let him know that you are aware this happens regularly to other people and that you are worried. Speak to him honestly and remind him that he carries your trust, love, honour and respect wherever he goes and if he cheats he will be betraying you and himself.    I think it is IMPORTANT to remind men about what is important to them and what they should NOT be taking for granted|`|T2iYetpkaa	I personally wouldn't be concerned...Does he call you regularly when he is away? Does he seem interested in the conversation? Does he make excuses to get off the phone?   Do you trust your relationship? Is it sexually satisfying for the both of you?  I would say without a bit more proof or reason to believe he sneaks around you dont have anything to worry about.|`|OSPDIm3yaa	try and stop every long distance in marrieg its brings suspitouse
0JDGHouKaa	I don't really have an answer for you, though I know what your going through.  My husband has a 3 year old son, and saw him a few times when he was born and then not again till he was 18 months because the mother didn't want anything to do with him.  He tried his hardest to be there for his son but it took forever to get to court and get joint custody.  He couldn't just break down her door.  Anway, he' almost 4 now and we have him every other weekend, when we do have him, all he talks about his is mother, and older brother and starts to cry. It's even worse when she calls every night we have him to speak with him, which is very frustrating and will be coming to a stop (her calling).  In our situation, she is not willing to work with us at all, and I'm sure has nothing good to say about us to her son.  We pay child support, and she's the one that can afford to buy him nice expensive things because of the money we give her, and we have rules where as she doesn't and lets him get away with anything and everything, which makes us no fun and look like bad guys.  We love him to death, and my husband is fighting for full custody.  I'm sorry your soon-to-be step daughter can't see the full picture in that you guys truely love her.  We keep hoping that when he is older he'll see that we love him with our hearts, and not money and jealousy.  I don't no much about the real mother in your case but some of the problem could line there.  Theres not much you can do but be there and keep pushing threw and hope when she's older she'll come around to her father and yourself, best advice I can give is, be strong and don't buy her love.     I wish the best for you 3!!!|`|5mefi2u5aa	You are making weekends fun.  You need to relax a little, she is finding her own little place in this and it will take time.  She does not think like an adult, she is not rejecting her dad or you by loving her mum, just telling you that she doesn't want to come.  She may not know why, 4 year olds often have 'feelings' they can't express.  She may even be worried about her Mum.    One thing is certain, kids often believe they are responsible for everything that is not right.  So never tell her that it upset you, tell each other.  Accept her and be completely relaxed - don't try too hard.  Let her adjust in her own time.    I suggest that you offer to just pick her up for the day, instead of all night, it can be difficult and scary for little ones to sleep in unfamiliar places.  She needs time to build trust and a bond with her dad and you.  Sometimes a lot of time.    Hopefully mum is on side and encouraging her to build this relationship, if not it may be worth seeking some counseling to help you all manage this time of adjustment.    Good luck, and well done you are doing well so far.|`|a984cQjKaa	well duh, your fiance wasn't a part of that little girl's life for three years, of course she's going to cry for her mom.  he may be her daddy, but he hasn't been there to change her diapers, to play games with her, to comfort her when she's sick, to put her to bed, to teach her colors, etc.  mom has been the one to do all that.  right now daddy is just a name for him, it doesn't' have any meaning the way mom does.   be patient, and hopefully with time that will change.|`|odR5CRWsaa	Not all children can deal with separation anxiety.  Some children look forward to different things and others only have to be told just before the event happens.  For example, don't tell her until just before she is coming.  Maybe the mother hasn't had her with a babysitter before.  The child may be extremely shy at first.  The mother should be aware of her daughter's reactions and deal with her immediately.|`|lL1IkNN7aa	oh your are a very nice person by taking part in the little girls life she has just bonded to much with her mum what you should do is still take her out with you fiance and bring her home at night that way she gets to see both her parents and the dad can still take part in her life during the day and she can see her mum at night and stay at night  im sorry if i made no sence only trying to help|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Too dependant on her mother, it's something you need to discuss with the mother. Otherwise all you can do is may be go out with her and the mother until she learns to love her father equally. Give it a try though|`|sowS7KW2aa	huh! ask your fiance to let his kids go to her mom what ever the kids want , now if too more problem better dump ur fiance and find a single guy|`|lOp75aGUaa	its just natural that his daughter has gotten more attached to her mom, going to her dads at first is reminding her she has to leave her mom. It doesn't mean she doesn't like being at dads, it just means she doesn't want to leave her mom.     in time she'll get used to going to dads, its not something that can happen overnight. but in the meantime...    she might have some friends over at dads house to have a sleepover, that would take her mind off it. Its a tough situation...

Go see a movie maybe or theatre (where you buy the tickets).  Or if you cannot afford any of this, just make sure you do everything in the house and dont let her do any wash up, leave her relaxing with wine.  And above all be gentleman, dont start pawing her and expecting to get laid, take that bit slowly.  Nothing more totally off putting than a guy pouncing on you straight away. Just be nice and be yourself.  Good luck.

Wgk5Q8Jbaa	It's an automatic repsonse, if someone hit you, wouldn't your first repsonse be to hit back even if they meant to or not?    That can be answered with simple psychology. She views her father as an authority figure & would therefore possibly be scared of reprisal for her actions, again an automatic response. Of course I can't speak for certainty as I don't know you or your wife, but if she hit you back, she obviously thinks of the relationship as one of equals, you hitting her again is just your way of subconsciously asserting your authority.|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	what???|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	ohhh well she shouldnt of hit you but u definatly should not of gave her 2 slaps after that...god  hope she used the coat hanger after you did she :L|`|agJ53hEXaa	it was an automatic reaction,you can't compare it to hitting her dad as it happened in the bed and she wouldn't be fooling around with her dad in bed!  what are you doing slapping her and with a coat hanger?i think you need some anger management.sorry but you sound like a bully.

But if he asks you out, tell him you want some time to think it over unless, of course, you already know that you don't want to date him.  Then just tell him you would like to keep your relationship as friends only.      If you haven't ruled out dating him but aren't sure about it, give it some thought & time - - there's no deadline!  After all, he's known for awhile that he likes you; he's had plenty of time to think about it.  If you are doubtful then I would suggest that you don't take it any further.  If after thinking about it, the idea of seeing him on a different basis appeals to you, then go for it.|`|Rbtl4Mbvaa	just ask him calmly  why he didn't ask u out earlier and ask him if he actually really does love you.|`|AA11840819	I married a guy I was friends with for 3 years before we dated one another.

Sometimes being silent and ignoring him when he is mad, works, especially in tiny situations like the  one you mentioned.   Try to put away some of the disturbing issues, till he calm down.  Or they won't be solved in a good way.  Try not to concentrate on such things.

The only thing I think you can do is set clear boundaries for his behavior toward you.  If it is stress, he's too stressed to modify his behavior based on "can we stop fighting".  I think all you can do is manage how you react to his moods and watch that it does not go downhill in terms of verbal attacks on you personally.      When he's picking a silly fight, refuse to engage by finding something fun to do in another room and say you'll give him oral when he's not so cranky.    Encourage him to keep balance in his life by helping him plan or encouraging him to spend down time (i.e. no cell, no blackberry, no tv).|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	if he is like this now,he is most likely to be worse when you are married...prooven fact! ask any married woman! so be careful and think about it ..|`|RxBe4y3Waa	oral sex is usually a good cure for cranky pant-itis :)|`|1BGwGFQZaa	I Suggest Moving Bella!

My current and I are living together now and I have decided to move. We are not argueing over petty things anymore since I have stated that no matter what the move will have to happen. I came to the conclusion that I need more money and the move is not entirely based on the dynamics of the relationship.    I think there is a beautiful part of the relationship that is missing and that is the dating part of the partnership. Basically my guy has little to no planning for such occasions now that we are living together. Of course there is the help that I get around the house. I want the permanent fix of marriage though. I am convinced that once I move he will be forced to make the effort to plan and cherish the moments that we have with one another.|`|pOCabUMvaa	If he is being a cranky pants, then can you imagine spending your life with a man like him??    Life is too short to be spending it with someone who makes your life really miserable.    Think about your future and your happiness.    He is only your fiance, call off the marriage.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	am not calling off the marriage to a wonderful man because of a case of stress! thats rediculous    I bet you your husbands "ex" wish's she paid attention to the warning signs.
I6qLIDTcaa	this has happened to me once before, my best friend she moved away and i have never seen her again since. i wish we stayed in contact.   the best way i think is to try and be strong and just keep in contact with her, as long as you still see her i'm sure things will stay the same between the two of you!  hope i helped!|`|pLVqQI5iaa	im sorry to hear that. keep in touch! it isnt hard. be pen-pals and you can meet each other every few weeks and then you'll have more to talk about! oh and also you can like make new friends! goodluck.|`|jNwkgcTCaa	Don't worry! You'll make new friends.  you guys can still keep in-touch, just write to each other and call each other or talk on AIM.  :]
yOTSC7Vxaa	Are you sure that's a good idea?    There was an incident on Oprah once about a young American girl who supposedly fell in love with a guy through MySpace and then she flew to his country to meet him.  They dated and she was staying with him but her family didn't approve because they were afraid she would get hurt. Apparently he did physically abuse her. People might not realistically be what they seem.    I don't encourage relationships to initiate this way but the only time you will know if you're in love with this guy is when you meet up with him that he is the same guy you got to know for 8 months and not just through one meeting but getting to know him everyday in person.    Rather be on the safe side and have a friend or group of friends with you when you meet this guy and make sure he is the real deal.    On the contrary, I would rather encourage you to go out with your mates and ask them to introduce you to some of their friends (especially the guys).    Good luck and please do confide in someone in your family or close personal friends.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i have no choice in this bloody f=+ucker. do I? I have no choice but to love you. I cant hate so what else is there? i hate you but absolutely adore the way you love me. and it makes me equaly in love with you. which seems rational and logical, we dont fall in love with logic but the love someone radiates towards us. I radiated towards you and you were trapped into something that not in your wildest dreams you would have done and now I am trapped.
ZSAbJEv6aa	It's not really difficult to get an annulment in the Philippines as long as you have valid grounds for filing one and can submit the necessary papers required in the application.  The valid grounds include:        1. Lack of parental consent in certain cases. If a party is 18 years or over, but below 21, and the marriage was solemnized without the consent of the parents/guardian. However, the marriage is validated if, upon reaching 21, the spouses freely cohabited with the other and both lived together as husband and wife.        2. Insanity. A marriage may be annulled if, at the time of marriage, either party was of unsound mind, unless such party after coming to reason, freely cohabited with the other as husband and wife.        3. Fraud. The consent of either party was obtained by fraud, unless such party afterwards, with full knowledge of the facts constituting the fraud, freely cohabited with the other as husband and wife. Fraud includes: (i) non-disclosure of a previous conviction by final judgment of the other party of a crime involving moral turpitude; (ii) concealment by the wife of the fact that at the time of the marriage, she was pregnant by a man other than her husband; (iii) concealment of sexually transmissible disease or STD, regardless of its nature, existing at the time of the marriage; or (iv) concealment of drug addiction, habitual alcoholism or homosexuality or lesbianism existing at the time of the marriage. However, no other misrepresentation or deceit as to character, health, rank, fortune or chastity shall constitute such fraud as will give grounds for action for the annulment of marriage.        4. Force, intimidation or undue influence. If the consent of either party was obtained by any of these means, except in cases wherein the force, intimidation or undue influence having disappeared or ceased, the complaining party thereafter freely cohabited with the other as husband and wife.        5. Impotence. At the time of marriage, either party was physically incapable of consummating the marriage with the other, and such incapacity continues and appears to be incurable. Impotence is different from being infertile.        6. STD. If, at the time of marriage, either party was afflicted with a sexually-transmissible disease found to be serious and appears to be incurable. If the STD is not serious or is curable, it may still constitute fraud (see No. 3 above).    And you will need to submit the following pertinent papers:  1) An authenticated copy of your marriage certificate and,  2) An authenticated copy of your children's birth certificates (if any) from the National Statistics Office (NSO)    Take note, too, that the rules of court now allows for non-resident Filipinos to file a petition for annulment of marriage in the Philippines.
oLV6uie1aa	Hmm..sounds like he has a little crush on u..BUT 8th graders can also take advantage of u! so becarful on that note!! k :) uR way too young to get into a relationship anywyas but if he duz ask u out for real..take it slwo nad easy...  just be friends with him the way he is with u. let him get to know who u are and wise versa through daily talks etc.....he msut be sensing that u like him a little too eh he he..    but just be careful is my advice to u ;) & Enjoy ur school life coz once u pass it u wont get it again! :D   TC|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	talk to him about it|`|R1zUIh7taa	Is he ever serious with you?

2o3BHgCCaa	As your dress has alot of detail I think you should go minimal or perhaps detailed earrings and no necklace.    The lighter fabric of the bridesmaids dresses makes me think that same thing for them.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I don't like that chunky set, it's too much.  I like very understated jewelry on brides.  the other set you picked out looks great, like it's held together with that invisible fishing line.  instead of crystals or gemstones for your bridesmaids I would go with a simple silver something for their necks with maybe 1 crystal hanging on it.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	that's a beautiful dress, and i think the jewelry will look fabulous with it!    i also think you've chosen a beautiful dress for the bridesmaids, and i would go minimal jewelry for them, too.|`|AA11082914	Love your dress, love your jewelery (those illusion necklaces are just cool...lol), love the maids' dresses (I'm using either that color or one VERY similar!). Not all about that second ebay necklace you posted....you're right it's too much. Other than the last link, I think EVERYTHING will look great together. The BM dresses are a great accent to your dress.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	These are great and i am sure they will look AMAZING together. i do however like the last necklace minus the huge pendant on it.|`|w1necKzYaa	I love them all! Beautiful I even like the last edit but the earrings are chunky!|`|esdjKGeBaa	Lovely, lovely, lovely, a million times lovely. I'd go for the minimal jewellery. By the way, may I also be your bridesmaid? (:   I love the colour of their dresses. Minimal jewellery for them, too.  P.S. Congrats on the big event.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	VERY nice  good choice  (bens sis here btw)  ?? great now i look like a crossdresser|`|xWaCmo4Taa	Lush :)|`|R1zUIh7taa	I also think that the bridesmaids should have basic jewelery!

dSMb8JDvaa	Yes, I am agreed because I am in the same boat with the man who is paying child support. But all the women who get the benefit of cause they wouldn't agree with you. The system is WRONG but you should know better before have kid, now it is too late isn't it? My husband is the same. He always chat with the web. man right group..try and search for it there is the place you could talk about it.
86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You have been taken for a fool.  And the saddest thing is that you let him do it.  What ever were you thinking when you accepted that your man could only see you two or three times a month.  Where did you suppose he was the rest of the time.  I think that deep down inside you have always known and maybe even revelled in the mystique, but now that it has all been blown wide open you have your pride at stake.  Forget your revelations to his wife and forget him, she has to cope with all the years of deceit but you are much luckier in that you are not legally tied.  Don't waste your breath or your time, you have such a lot of catching up to do in a normal relationship.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Just move on. The wife knows her husband is a cheat and she won't want to hear details from the woman who was screwing her husband.  The bottom line is that wives are more likely to forgive their husband (seems to me a bit of mental dishonesty but a lot of people are good at that) and blame the "whore" (even if she was innocent and didn't know the guy was married).  Bottom line, YOU are the enemy to her and always will be.|`|dzbblpjgaa	It may not be news to her how he behaves. Have you thought about how she might react other than going crazy. It will make you look truly silly, she may even feel sorry for you. Alternately you could put yourself at risk if she reacts badly, or she could invite you in to confront him directly. Any or all of the options will not really benefit you or help you in anyway. It would not really serve any purpose. I would make my whole life revolve around myself for a few weeks until I had some sense of peace and a clear head to make plans in work and meet friends (some fogotten?) until I have a better perspective of what I want from life. Who were we talking about?|`|AWb0L9IKaa	He has made it clear, he doesn't want you, so why are trying to punish the innocent woman? just take it as good riddance to bad rubbish and move on with your life.|`|lM7xPQg0aa	don't be so hard on yourself , you were taken advantage of ..but, no one can use you if you don't let them. He lied to you but, you also put yourself in a situation in which you had little adult responsibility like becoming pregnant, and if you didn't miscarry you would be dealing with fighting with him for child support for the next 18 years. Also, since he cheated on his wife who knows what he does and you didn't protect yourself from diseases hepatitis c, aids, herpes gonorrhea etc.     you don't say how old you are , but I am guessing early 20's  because you haven't learned to let it go. If his wife found out about him ,kicked him out etc why would she want to hear from you ..is it a girls club? no, leave it alone, get on with your life and learn from your mistake so you don't repeat this situation ever again|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	If she read the texts, she already knows what she married.    If you confront her, she may well say things you really don't want to hear. No offense, but ultimately, she's the injured party here.     Try to get on with your life.  The only one or two visits a month should tip you off in the future.    And seriously...good luck.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	why would you want a man who lies and cheats then hurts you but cutting ties with you, take it as a harsh lesson learnt but to further hurt and upset his wife again what would you gain from that. you at least had choices once you found out he was married you should of walked away you recognise this now so do what you know to be the right thing.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	a man will tell you any lies to get you to sleep with him and be his other woman. i bet you anything that his marriage was fine..maybe his wife was just al ittle overweight or something to make him come on to you! cant you imagine how much his wife is already hurting. you have already won- she kicked him out, but if he has already told you that he no longer wants you and only wants her then honey you just have to let it go. he was just using you. MARRIED ME ALWAYS SAY THEY WILL LEAVE THEIR WIFE AND I GUARANTEE YOU THEY WILL NOT!
gfLuU4Yoaa	this sounds like a typical guy to be honest.. they can dish it out but they cant take it :(.. in all fairness you weren't even going out with him so it wasnt cheating.. you were just doing a normal thing so you shouldnt feel guilty.    I think he probably regrets losing you. He didnt notice at the time but now he knows that other people want you hes jealous. He may not want to be with you but he just doesnt like the thought of you with other people.    I got really hurt by one of my exes and it is kind of weird to think of them with someone else because you once had a connection with them. That might be why.    Just dont feel guilty.. you didnt do anything wrong.    x|`|zon13nY2aa	You broke up 3 years ago. Jeez, I can't even remember who I dated 3 years ago!    He cheated on you and betrayed you in the worst way possible so why do you care what he thinks?    You didn't cheat, therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about. Just move on and ignore him when you see him.|`|Gpd6PN1haa	Sweety your relationship has come to an end three years ago. It should not really matter to him what you did from that time on and who you slept with. You did not do it to hurt him and that is what is important! Let go if he does not want to talk its his problem dont get stuck with him cos it will hurt you again|`|Skiummxlaa	Time to move on. Why are you so worried about what he thinks? Do you feel bad because you have done something against your character? Above all in life you need to be true to yourself, Be honest with yourself about why you are upset by this. I would suggested that you need to explore what it is your upset about and then focus on your future and being the best you, you can be. If you are being true to yourself you will attract the right person for you. Don't focus so much on what you think others want you to be.
R1zUIh7taa	I'm sorry you are in that situation, but there is nothing you can do!  Hopefully you will find someone who likes you!|`|wE2etBzbaa	I would turn the other cheek|`|tPlJX0Jmaa	ahh go away lol she dont like ya
ACecbVghaa	Since the harpist would only be playing the music, the lyrics are almost irrelevent. If the music sounds great by itself, don't worry about the lyrics. I doubt any of your guests will be saying "Wait a minute, that first verse is not about them!" Enjoy!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I like the sentiment.  assuming it'll be an instrumental arrangement with no one singing the lyrics, it'll sound great.  I would audition the harpist first and make sure you like the way it sounds tho, if not then pick another song because it's probably not the harpist, but that song might not sound good on that instrument.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I always love when someone does an instrumental version of a pop song at their wedding.  We're having a string quartet version of "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey as one of our prelude songs- the lyrics don't have anything to do with us, but I've always loved the song and think it is so pretty at the end.  Do what you want.  I think people will dig it if it makes you happy.|`|R1zUIh7taa	I think I personally wouldn't have it to walk down the isle and have it played as your first dance.  I don't think the beginning of the song makes a difference if you both like the song!
zQ0mUDBUaa	Did you mean good LUCK guessing? =p LOL    Subjects and minors???    Get over yourself!    If your going to degrade your subjects and minors then check your grammar first!
lM7xPQg0aa	DO YOU LIVE IN AMERICA? IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT, what did you promise her? What is  a wife? It is not your slave or servant. You trusted her by opening an account with her (which you should have)   what kind of marriage is it , do you live together? what kind of commitment is this? did you love each other or did you have an arranged marriage ? I am guessing arranged and you expected a perfect little woman who would do everything you asked or told to do when ever what ever . did you expect this forever that only works on very young naive women but women grow and change so you actually need to grow up too . Learn about what marriage is in the land that you live now. what it takes to make a woman happy and learn to respect them and you in return will or should get the same thing   treat others as you would like to be treated that's a good start|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Apparently she has problems and appears to be very young and does not understand the things involved with a marriage.  It would benefit all if this marriage ended and everyone grew up.  Good luck.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	ohh wow..  that's terrible!  think it over really well...before you decide to go ahead with the divorce!  if you feel that you can't trust her with things like that, then you should..
mmMgfhf2aa	You may like this new guy and he may like you but it's all probably just the thrill of having someone new taking an interest that's giving you a bit of a buzz. Just remember, your current boyfriend likes you a hell of a lot. After all, he's been with you for a year and a half. Can this new guy match that?|`|JKMYZjipaa	If you do something and then later find yourself regretting or asking yourself if u regret it, then u REALLY are regretting it. Please next time try to avoid getting in too deep before u are sure about the guy. Pliz take time to enjoy yourself and have fun coz you are still young. The time to settle down will come later and by then you will be sure about the guy. Tadaa!!!!!!|`|jYLZYxDvaa	No because I am faithful and have respect for others, maybe try growing up.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	If you are wondering if you are regretting getting into a serious relationship too young, well, then you are!    At your age, you should be dating different people, having different experiences, learning about life.    "Liking" someone isn't a good enough reason to be in a serious relationship with them at your age.    You might talk to your current boyfriend, and explain to him that you feel you are much too young to be settling down yet. That your feelings for him haven't changed, but you need to explore things before you settle in with any one person.    He may be hurt, since he obviously cares for you, and particularly since he's getting old enough to maybe want to settle down.  But, he shouldn't be angry.  If he gets angry with you, then perhaps he's too immature himself still to understand.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	You are way too young to settle down. You should go out with the younger guy and tell the old fart that he needs to slacken the reins!|`|5VeXOv5Aaa	i don't know because i am also 17|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	I think you are very young to have a serious relationship with a 24 year old.  At your time of life you should just be out dating and having fun with your friends.
88c4c1b53052663ce9e2c8ab0f941b2eaa	Did you expect a reason???     In there culture a man is god and he does not have to give you a reason.    No hard feelings, but that's a different culture and mixing 2 opposite cultures is hard. A culture where we will never fully understand .|`|RxBe4y3Waa	wow! it sounds like you are the kind of person who likes a challenge. he sounds very challenging. i wouldn't be able to deal with it. won't he flip out that you are asking this question? it sounds like he's giving you the perfect opportunity to get out of there, you might want to consider it. good luck! you deserve someone more appreciative and understanding.|`|50zbKv0jaa	you married a arab and a muslim  of course you will have problems  of course he will judge you    divorce him|`|i1rDJY2aaa	His reaction is selfish and immature. You bettered yourself by trying to learn a new language, HIS language, and he threatened divorce!!!  What an ******.  You're better off without him. Be with a man that respects you and supports you. This man will only bring you down.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	leave. why would you want to be in a controlling marriage. here's your chance now RUN!|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	Wait till he calms down and then talk to him. Tell him that your intention is to understand, impress and communicate with him in his language.   Since you married a man from a very conservative part, you should understand his intention.     By the way, we when you agreed to marry him. You agreed on living the same life he is living. If you are having trouble with that tell him what you are feeling.|`|pOCabUMvaa	Well, if he is being that way, then I guess you are really done.    Who in the world wants to spend the rest of their life with a jerk like him??    Geesh, there are so many other problems in the world and he has to sit there and give you a hard time with you just picking up a new hobby???    Lose the looser!!!|`|JjoLo4e1aa	Hes obviosly hiding stuff from, dump him and take all his stuff in the divorce|`|3elj0E81aa	wow! that was heavy!  chatting, and even flirting harmlessly is quite okay between most couples... yours is a way more innocent thing .. i think he's subjecting you to too many shackles.. had i been in your place i would have walked out... of the relationship.. i know this might not be the solution you are lookin for... whatever you do .. just be happy..  GOD BLESS|`|TdPxjQDbaa	whatever word you wanted to know the meaning forget it .the best thing to do is to ask your husband to teach you arabic  instead of chatting with other people .i am sure that he said  this word to you because maybe he is afraid too. he is a man don't you think that he knows more than you how men are? don't be stress and talk to him .tell him to forgive you for your mistake and that you won't chat with other people and you want hime to teach you arabic|`|UDInHk0jaa	Sorry, but you made the choice to marry into that culture.  It is what it is.  This stuff you can't take anymore isn't going away nor will it change.  Either accept it (and live miserably) or get yourself out of this marriage and MOVE ON!|`|a984cQjKaa	leave him.  you're better off without him anyway.  you're lucky he didn't try to make you wear a burqha or try to stone you to death for having contact with other men.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	what is his problem?!  im sorry about what happened..  you deserve to be treated much better!  wow..it must have been very hard when you married him!  sorry to say, i think you should divorce him!|`|qms67wSWaa	why would u marry an arab ?? =S IM AN ARAB BY THE WAY lol !!!  but anyway that was really dumb of him and i think yo should ask for a divorce =S .... seems like he's insecure or a loser .  btw not all arabs are like that .|`|OSPDIm3yaa	tell him to buy u a arab book and learn it privatly,and get the orther from him,remeber he is your head,chating may creat suspisiouse|`|wqnV1OLWaa	the problem is not that you married an arab, its that you married one of the bad kind,, im an a arabian woman, married to an arabian man, he's wonderful, he's educated, open minded, a gentelman, and gives me the freedom i want, he's the perfect husband, not all arabs like ur husband, what he did is insane and unlogical, i guess he's feeling insecure or lacks confidence that he's afraid to lose you, ur both are from different cultures, i doubt it'll work out, try talking to him first, if his behaviors didnt improve, start talking about divorce, sorry,,

I know about 99% of my mates would date alot of girls that they are friends with, including me...if your not ugly (hate to be harsh...but thats life) then you would be very unlucky if he said no...  and if you are scared to ask him out...look at it this way    Say someone has taken your mum....and she will be killed if you don't ask this guy out, you wouldn't hesitate to tell him would you. Its all just simply fear, but most sincere guys are nice if they were to let you down...which basicly never happens|`|D02rAMWoaa	Amanda, back off just a bit and you will probably see more clearly  where he is coming from...Good Luck.|`|hwFs3F0Waa	You have two choices.  1 is that you can ask him out straight forward and the old fashion way.  2 is that you can wait forever until he asks you out.      1 is for if you really absoulutly like him and you want to marry him and  2 is for if you can wait and find out the truth and not be embarresed.|`|1a38FtEcaa	go for it... the most he can do is say no?

And ofcourse id get them a wicked cute puppy :D|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I sort of wonder what his reasons are.    Is he just making empty promises to stop a nagging child?    Does he want a dog but can't afford to adopt and maintain one?  Or, do they live somewhere currently that doesn't allow larger pets like dogs?    Is he waiting until the children show that they are responsible enough to handle the dog?    Is he waiting until the children have met some goal that indicates they deserve a large reward like a dog?|`|YWUjeTnUaa	Well it really depends on the circumstances. If he said something like "when you show me your are responsible you can have a dog" and you haven't shown him anything....I could understand him not coming through.    Also remember keeping pets is expensive, It costs me abut 100 bucks a month just to feed my 2 dogs. That doesn't count vet bills, shots and preventative meds like heart worm and flea control. Maybe you dad just can't afford the extra expense right now.    Ask him why and work toward a solution.|`|vkQOcqKwaa	It would be very saddening for the kid and the kid would not really believe the parent again if he promises something else in the near future.|`|rQG60W0Eaa	i think the kid should get a dog|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	My parents always promise things they won't give.  So I don't care anymore.|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	I would say that he just doesn't know how much it means to his kids and needs to be reminded.  I'm sure he is a loving father.
fL8QIhfyaa	let her live her life and learn from her mistakes ...the most you can do is tell her how you feel and why you feel the way you do otherwise if you try to butt in she may resent you for not letting her live her own life. I have dated some real losers in my past but with every bad experience made me just that much stronger. I am not married and I am the way that I am because of my past relationships! I know you want to protect her but she just might not to be saved :)  your a great sister though :)|`|a984cQjKaa	you're not dating him, so don't worry about it.  she'll find out about him soon enough, and then maybe she'll be wiser in the future.  it sucks, but you gotta let people learn from their own mistakes.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Frame him.|`|hFNS77cNaa	Put a bunch of condoms in his coat pocket or bag. Then run into him on 'accident' and they all fall out. Then put on the most angry face ever and ask him what the **** they are for.
JI7NQ9TNaa	Child support is not "payment for visitation".  It is simply a contribution to the upkeep for a child.  Men often ask if they can sever their ties to a child, expecting that it will also mean an end to child support payments.  The courts do not see it that way.    Good luck with this.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Paying child support isn't an option, seeing your child is.|`|a984cQjKaa	it depends; is he not seeing his child because he wants nothing to do with it or because the mother isn't letting him?|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Doesn't matter if he has nothing to do with his child... It takes TWO to make a baby.....it is then the responsibility of both Father and Mother to raise the child properly.  If the Father does not want to see the child, or can't...for whatever reason, he should still be financially supporting the child.  Children should NOT be punished for their parents actions.......or lack of them.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	it does not matter he is the day he needs to help pay for what the child needs just like a woman who does not have custody needs to pay for child support to regardless if she see the child or not..|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	Yes.  but, I also think the laws need to change quickly so the father doesn't have to hire an attorney to see his child.      child support and visitation should be figured at the same time through the C.S office.  a guy shouldn't have to spend thousands on an attorney just for visitation of HIS child
xeW6Mvbdaa	The guy is psycho...run like the wind....and don't look back.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	You are right, it sounds like he doesn't know what he wants.    Actually, he probably does know what he wants-you, when he feels like it, and the opportunity to persue other girls when he feels like it. Right at this moment, he has both.    A good idea would be tell him you still like him, but you aren't interested in playing games with him anymore.  Either you are in a relationship with him, or you aren't. And if you aren't, you don't want to see or speak to him if it's not absolutely necessary(and, it shouldn't be necessary).    You need to put quite a bit of distance between the two of you. One, it will allow you to get over him. Two, it will give him a chance to see what he's missing.    You may well get over him, and wonder what you saw in him in the first place.  Or, you may miss each other(you need to stay away from him for several months, at least), and eventually decide to get back together. But either way, time apart(really apart) might be a good idea at this time.|`|1a38FtEcaa	this guy is playing mind games. tell him how you feel what you want if hes still dragging you through the dirt leave him alone!!|`|XmEjhMvRaa	This guy sounds weird. Move on and don't try to do any kind of contacting with him, maybe send him a card or something in the mail.|`|XPbwSSoaaa	that guy wants to take advantage of u and really wants to be in control of the relationship and do wateva he wants with u.  Now i say u can stop him and turn the tables around: Be in control!  Do not allow him to stroke you anywhere and at the same time do not be rough or show that u were hurt rather be unavailable or appear to be very busy when u see him. Do not try talking to him and don't call him. If he calls u keep the conversation short and at time ignore his calls. He has to value you!   i bet he will reverse those nasty and meaningless statements!  good luck|`|fcf1403493d1c4c5258f03b4f5220173aa	Why are you still seeing him? Tell him to get the hell out of Dodge and go find yourself someone else. If you are not together and you have to be in his company then kick him in the nads if he strokes your arm or face. He would not do it to another woman so why does he think it is ok to do it to you? By letting him do it and not stopping it then you are gicing the message that it is OK. Move on young lady, he is playing you.|`|So5192WDaa	tricky. i guess you need to talk to him and find out ehat he really wants, out your mind at rest.    If its not you, move on :)
XOSc4cq3aa	It's one thing getting away from each other for some time. But if you both are dating other people, I don't think you'll be back with each other. I think it's over.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Depends on your later experiences.  I say %10 chance, if you guys both date other people.|`|2f26fcdfc1c8b468a66c330a0d519a3faa	may b yes may b no.  the answer 'yes':u both might find u still miss him and u can't live without and ther might b a chance to get 2gether.  the answer'no': u might felt its the greatest thing that happen in your life , u found some 1 better~!    decision is up 2 u .|`|lfpay4yHaa	Its very unlikely that  you will get together again  by chance...that is unless you try.  maybe you should just continue dating other guys.
Pl9lY7qCaa	This guy is no more interested in you & you're wasting your time, why don't you move on? Sorry to say this but there's no other go or if, give a last try & talk to him.|`|FKXG3IPiaa	It doesn't matter that he loves you still or whatsoever.    Matter is whether you love him or not , how much do you love him, how much do you love  LOVE itself. What you can do to get your love.Upto what extent you can go in love.    Dear if you have answer for all the above questions , you know what to do.    It is upto the person , if i love someone i will never leave her simply beacuse she is not talking to me. I will do whatever in this world to get my love.|`|PovR8mPGaa	That is not important u lov* him.  But that more that he loves u or not.  Fristly u may varify it.  good luck.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	It appears this colleague is not interested in you anymore.  Not much you can do about that.|`|bUmdkEnxaa	You read what Racer has written. If you do not accept, my approach is to write down his hobbies and good qualities and match with yours. If they match ,then use all force to marry.(Even you can study palmistry ,handwriting analysis to understand his nature, palmistry is simple) Other wise your marriage will not be successful.Meanwhile ,I have also asked a question in this section. You can see my question , first click on my profile picture, then click on questions  to see the question I have asked .You can also write your opinion about my question, Your answer may be correct or wrong do not worry.
whfbEPPeaa	They can do if both of you work hard enough at it. It is rare that they survive in the long run, but that's no reason not to try if both your feelings are strong enough. At the end of the day it depends what you want from the relationship and whether you can get that at a distance.|`|lyDzjMfcaa	Depends, but in my opinion no.  They never seem to turn out good.|`|OE8r1VtRaa	mine never have, but it depends on how much you trust each other and how often you get to see each other. I personally didnt see him enough and couldnt trust him, if your different and wanna be togetehr then yeah sure it could work.|`|ou104VaHaa	Most of the time one of you end up going for someone else because your lonely but if u love Him/Her and He/She loves u dont give up.|`|GO5LMhjkaa	yes it does. am in one as welll just talk alot to eachonther and be open about your feelings. remind your partner how you feel about them all the time you talk|`|Y2fCkspbaa	I think it depends what age your at.  How much you love the person.  and if its really worth it, hardly seeing him/her  cause i know i would not cope not seeing my boyfriend for a week - two week|`|6boH5X5Baa	no i'm sorry if its a disappointment but they never turn for the best|`|Ng0oiFvhaa	well if u guyz love other it will be forever but if different circumstances happened  between u guyz i dont think it will be for long distance...hope i helped|`|f5WU05Fraa	Any relationship will work as long as both of you's work at it. If it's worth fitting for then it'll work.|`|5F1UErrhaa	They can, but you have to be deeply in love.    If you've been going out for a few months and then it goes long-distance, I don't think it could work.  But everyone's different, so you can't truthfully and reliably say.|`|5kjYFb9Taa	They are very hard to work. I tried, but it was almost impossible. Theres always that void feeling, that makes you want to see what else is out there.|`|ae151ebdc335662b7002da215ee08b6baa	yes|`|nS6wnQGPaa	It can be. It is a matter of two of u, not because of the distance.|`|MsrxAZ6Laa	ya truly because relationship's are made from heart and what does not need a coverage area or so to work well.would you love to be indulge with me in one.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	depends how much you love the person i guess|`|hwQoOSfRaa	yes, I'm now married to a guy who used to live 300 miles away from me.  You make them work.  We used to make sure we made time to talk every day.  Now living together with a beautiful 5 month old.|`|aEonduUUaa	no it wont really, and its bad because u dont know really what they do during the course of the whole time u two didnt see each other so i really think long distance relationships wont turn out good and most dont ^^
zth3G2b6aa	omg this is SO my life! lol except im 17.   my best guy friend also happens to be really hott and a great dancer, and we talk all the time. but we are a little more than friends, as we always have been...but its open and free spirited which i think you are going to have to be bc like you said its awkward otherwise.   just except that friend-lover relationship and realize that it may not be like that all the time but when it is, you know its true.   if you feel more and you had sex with him, and youve been good friends for 2 yrs, then i bet he likes you in that way too...i would guess.     good luck!! i love being in love with my best friend!!|`|BzQp8qUXaa	go to grammer school|`|JjoLo4e1aa	JUST CALL HIM and hook up again, your alreeady friends so give it a shot|`|eLjcGsHcaa	hweres the question?|`|PrarLmbxaa	Well, if he doesn't feel the same way about you (more than friends) then I don't recommend casual sex again, you will end up feeling heart broken, he won't understand why, big drama.  But if you are ok with just casual sex then go for it, but casual sex is no place for "more than friends" feelings, or at least make sure you are both on the same page before you do anything else, that way no one (hopefully) gets hurt.|`|5UwQtCzOaa	if you feel more than friendship then tell him how you feel. The only way you are going to know if he feels the same is if you confront him about it.  Don't corner him, just tell him how you feel and ask if he feels the same...|`|vTQMIxvnaa	ask him............|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	does he feel the same as you .. then its love baby .. go for it|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	Time and just how you act around each other will tell all.  If you try to avoid each other or stop talking, it wasn't meant to be.  Don't use sex as a way to rate a relationship.|`|aEonduUUaa	Ask him to go along with the relationship with you |`|uvOhOUllaa	chances are he was just looking to score....    sorry, no relationship for you...|`|dKq0Ak4taa	ur 23 and still cant type properly
lYZ71zYAaa	If your staying with someone because of the kids, that is not a marriage. You know he will continue to see is ex wife! They went on vacation together. Get out of that marriage. He doesn't want to be married to you all he wanted was children because he couldn't with the first wife. You get a divorce, you'll have custody of the kids, he'll pay child support, and get visitation rights. But don't stay with him because of the kids,That is a loveless marriage. And you deserve more than that. He cheated on you. And he'll do it again.|`|FxAD44Moaa	wait a min... what?      you lost me  after   i'm a second wife....|`|crxbob5jaa	Kick him out. You don't need this man.|`|MrAREmmJaa	Oh you poor thing.... just get out before its too late.  I was married for 21 years before I saw what my husband was doing to me.  He just used to verbally and emotionally abuse me because he was a control freak and just wanted me for himself.  Didn't want me to see my family, friends, etc.  Control, control.... thats all it was.  Don't let your husband control you by letting him see other women, etc.  My husband didn't even want me to love our kids, thats how jealous and controlling he was.  Its kills love between two people.  Anyway, you sound like you could use some help... go and see a counsellor.  I am sure they will tell you the same thing GET OUT - after a while the hurt stops|`|R1zUIh7taa	I'm sorry he doesn't want to be with you, and that he only wants the kids!  I think you should talk to a lawyer and find out your rights!  Make him start paying child support.  You should also find someone to talk to, to deal with your problems emotionally.  I'm really sorry you are going through this.  It is probably best to get it over with now and make sure you get help for the kids!
nOFvdF9yaa	Before completing 10 days only, it's not fair to use word like 'cheating' in friendship. The boy may left forever, so what? friendship is there.   [By the way, I only know what friendship is; don't know much about the boyfriendship yet! In any way, I would never import the word 'cheating' in friendship. Rather say, it was not a friendship; it was a contact.]|`|KwNpyp3saa	I think it is odd he hasn't tried to keep in touch with her, especially if he is buying her a ring. Does he want to make her worry? There is nothing she can do but wait. I would wonder about someone who is in love and is getting a ring but doesn't keep in contact with his intended.|`|5HeNp5tjaa	he could possibly be cheating or maybe theres a problem where he cant get to a computer but if he was serious  about the relationship he would find a way to communicate with her
IPS3hWweaa	It's because the guy is insecure and a control freak. And contradictory to what Joe C said, he is also a Republican (AKA right wing nut job, loser).    Stand up for yourself, and tell him you are free to talk to whomever you choose. He doesn't own you and you don't own him. If he can't take it, it's time to split. You really shouldn't waste your time and life with this kind of guy. They rarely change.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Because you let them tell you not to talk to other guys.  As long as neither one of you aren't doing anything that crosses the line... I don't see the problem in talking to the opposite sex. I have more male friends than females cos I don't get along with girls.. my husband doesn't care... heck... he knows I stay at my male friends houses... but he also knows I don't sleep with them... It's called trust... and I've proven time and time again he can trust me.. and I can trust him...|`|zrUbBiFdaa	i know, its annoying =_=|`|aEonduUUaa	There guys, we are all different thats the simplest answer ever..|`|xHcQSLiVaa	IDK Does your boyfriend know that you said this to me?  You better be careful.  LOL|`|s4FEJiNHaa	not every guy does that!  Why would u even date a guy who does?|`|uvOhOUllaa	SO true, it makes me so angry when a guy does that!|`|Dfppbeo8aa	Why would you let another person tell you who you can talk to?|`|tC6MG0nyaa	thats how guys r.. my guy too.. i hate that..|`|2f26fcdfc1c8b468a66c330a0d519a3faa	it seems 'your guy' is a selfish one|`|3WAoZclbaa	well if ur guys like that ...then leave him ..how is that fair...i would cut off my bf's balls if i wasnt treated equally.-then leave|`|yktlEbZeaa	guys dnt trust girls. if a boy calls me on the phone my bf would b on da line with his cuzin 2 n when my bf gotta get off the phone his cousin will start making noises like he bout to tell my boyfriend.|`|cyanbMaqaa	Because the lady have to learn to listen or obey,    too often ladies are not careful they are weaker than the man they are more easily falling into traps than the man they are more fragile.science agree with this too.    Hope to help you.|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	because guys do not trust other guys(u know every other woman like u allways call namen to guys) and on the contrary girls are so trustworthy,so true ,so nice, so gentle that they do not feel it unethical to talk to many girls.|`|UXOegnWvaa	They are insecure.  My girlfriend can talk to whoever she wants, I know who shes coming home to at the end of the day.  Shes a partner not property.|`|G2K8gsKLaa	LOL that person who said territorial haha thats funny as XD|`|oLV6uie1aa	THAT MY FRIEND IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT! Hm...wut is it wth them? They seem to be pretty selfish and jealous. But not all are like this! In a relationship its alwasy best that the guy even thought he may have many gf and bf..never give a wrong idea to the gf he hangs out with apart from his own GF! there has to be a certain level of understanding with other ladies he associates with. in that way u dont have to owrry at all whom he talks with and u can trust him. :) in teh same way a girl shld know how to talk to other guys too while being in a relationship with someone special. coz in this world a small misunderstanding can give out the wrong idea!!!|`|vTQMIxvnaa	because they are stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i really when they do that.............|`|qpOrnh1Maa	its  called control. they feel they have to be the man. some comes from them having a guilty concscience some comes from them being insecure they aren't that great to u and they think if a decent man comes around u'll leave them. most of the time its one of those 2 things
Fsr2Rofzaa	no I don't feel guilty b/c I do not engage in that type of behavior.  On;y shittty human beings with no charater do this knowingly|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	hell yeah!|`|yOLeRiTZaa	.~_~    NO....Cu'z I absolutely Would NOT Could NOT do anything like that!!    There is just a code.....YOU DON'T DO IT!    I know it happens every day, but it is SO wrong.  NOW...IF you didn't know they had a GF/Wife, well that's Different. Then the dude should feel the guilt. (either way he should)  And if you later find out they have a partner, well  think you should contact them and let them know. Cu'z YOU won't be the first girl he cheats with.you'lll just be ONE of the girls he cheats with. Cu'z Guys are pigs!!  (SORRY GUYS, YOU KNOW IT !)  Ya just gotta put yourself in that girls position. How would you feel? Cu'z it would CRUSH you.  I have never been cheated on, but I know how I have felt when I had an EX  later on have a new GF. YOU don't want him anymore, yet..You kinda don't want anyone else to want him either. Does that make sense?    Well, that's all I have to say about this one...    I hope you have a Good Day!     Oh, I'm not angry or nothing, just passionate about certain things so I use the CAPS, to express this passion. I'm sure you are just posing a question, for the sake of the question, not cu'z you'ree personally seeing some girls, guy. K?  SO... Sorry 'bout the CAPS. :(  K?  I like to use'em.  In case you can't tell, I like to use the lil'apostrophes too.  :)    Whew...That struck a nerve, didn't it? ( I also have/had a friend that cheats on her hubby, &...she, herself has nicknamed, herself the, "Ally Cat") So I'sorry. K?    Oh, and I have a habit of creating really long answers, so I'sorry 'bout that too.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-~_~.    .|`|dKq0Ak4taa	because its someone elses boyfirend/husband hence they love them   would you get upset if ur boyfriend/husband slept withg someone else   if you do it to them they will do it bak to u|`|tPlJX0Jmaa	NO NO NO|`|OE8r1VtRaa	i would never do it, its just disgraceful, i would hate it if someone slept with my boyf or he cheated on me, its degrading and shows low self respect just warming someones bed for the night. makes youjust a cheap dirty whore.
