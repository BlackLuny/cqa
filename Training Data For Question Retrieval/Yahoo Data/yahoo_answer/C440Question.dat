Front left makes a clunk occassionally when parking, right side, torn plastic cover observed last week. Are ball joints in the rear also? Can anyone give a rough estimate to replace or fix the front two, they have no failed. The car doesnt pull ever, its just a clunk when pulling left into a parking place or when pulling the wheel back to straighten out after parking. After responses to my last question I found this article and figure this is what is going on since the car is rear wheel drive. I see also the cvc can be affected too. So without thinking of repairling replacing those since I have no real diagnosis yet, any rough estimates, is this a 200.00 fix or a 500.00 fix? I just replaced the tranny/radiator that bled into each other for the tune of 3500.00, the second time in 3 years :(. So thats 7000.00 for the tranny/radiator, and this time I had them put in a transcooler so it wont happen again. I only paid 5000.00 so this is one expensive old car :( I really cant afford to go get somthing else at this time, so Id like to just keep this one running. Any guesstimates out there, thank you for your time I do appriciate it very much.

I have a 6" pot 1 ft tall Ming Aralia, and all the leaves except the top two stems are now drooping.        Description of environment:      - 10 ft x 15 ft room, 2nd floor, in New York, NY   - very dry and a bit hot due to 24/7 heating over which i have no control (as soon as i get a thermometer, i'll update this with the temp)   - the only window is south-facing and gets lots of direct sunlight      How i have situated the plant:      - sitting on a tray of clothespins sitting in a quarter inch of water.  the plant is not touching the water.   - directly in front of the window.  i move it along the windowsill as the sun moves throughout the day, trying to keep it away from direct light, but it sometimes hits it.     - when the entire windowsill is soaking in direct light, i move the plant to the floor, where it is a bit cooler and still bright, but not hit by the sunlight.   - though i often open the window, it opens in such a way that the plant is never hit by the wind.      How i water:      - as i said, it is extremely dry in my room from the constant heating, so i water every 3 or 4 days.  the top half-inch of soil dries out in one day.   - each time i water, i use tap water and pour just enough to cover the top surface, about 4 oz.    - i mist the leaves and the immediate periphery as frequently as possible.      I'd appreciate your feedback on what i'm doing wrong and advice on how to best remedy the plant.  Please let me know if you need more information.  Thanks in advance!

20090307092010AAxtbGh	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	With a continuous soffit vent, do I need to install baffles between each of the rafters?	I have a continuous soffit vent that runs along three sides of my living room.  I plan to add alot more insulation in the attic above it, so I will need to add baffles to keep the insulation from clogging up the vent.  The space is approximately 16'x24', with the vent running 16' on one side, 24' across the front, and 16' on the other side.  I will be adding fiberglas insulation.  Do I need to install baffles between all of the attic rafters, or can/should I skip every other one?

20090307093715AAOIvO2	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Need help with walls?	I live in a house that is about 35 years old. The person who built the house did a horrible job with the drywall. Well the dry wall isn't bad but he didn't sand the spackle. You can see the edges of the drywall. What can I do to cover up the mess without redoing the walls? Do you think paint textures would help? Someone told me about thin drywall that you put up over an existing wall but I couldn't do it on all my walls and it sounds like more than I would be able to do.

20090307091156AApYnDf	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Craftsman 6.6 HP Push mower pull starter problem.?	My pull start on this craftsman 6.6 HP push mower wont pull out and I know what the problem is I just need to get access to the pullstart. But I basically removed every bolt and plastic part from the engine trying to get access to the pullstart but no sucess. The reason I can get access is because theres this metal type sheild over top of it thats preventing me from even seeing the pull rope to fix it. But there is this weird white plastic peice in the center with 2 black plastic peices to the side its hard to explain but its in the dead center of the pull start.I have no idea if thats how you remove it. But here is a diagram  http://c.searspartsdirect.com/lis_png/PL...        Anybody have any clue how I can get access to this pullstart? The rope specificaly.
20090307091355AANV7a3	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Blockage in our central heating pipes!?	Microbore,Hep2o unvented heating system blockage?   Some years ago I had a new central heating system installed using Hep2o microbore piping.      Unfortunately we are currently having a problem with the circulation as we appear to have blocking in the pipes causing the radiators not to heat properly. The pipe deposit seems to be a very fine metallic powder which is causing the problem. I have called in a heating engineer but he is having difficulty in clearing the blockage. The system is a sealed, unvented design.      He is now proposing trying a compressor to see if he can blow the pipes clear: unfortunately this has not been successful either.Can you offer any advice as we cannot understand why this is happening. I chose to have the system installed with Hep2o to avoid the usual problems associated with copper and steel but for some reason I am experiencing more problems than I would have expected from Hep2o and its specification claims. We have power flushed but no luck. Is there any way to clear microbore piping without having to repipe which in our case would be a major undertaking( and costly)   Thanks   Your urgent help would be much appreciated.            Yours            Philip Fielding      philipfielding@hotmail.co.uk

Happy all this time - suddenly yesterday out of the blue, 4 months later the central screw hole is dripping water.  Is it a condensation thing?  There can't possibly be a pipe there as the house was build before central heating and any case that would be under the floor. Can anyone help me, its dripping quite a bit?

20090307100822AAbHxQq	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	How can I deal with noisy and annoying neighbours?	I live in an apartment (same one for 3 yrs) and after all this time I finally made it a home, and I got new neighbours a few months back. They have since been nothing but noisy and annoying. They blast music till past midnight, any night of the week. During the day they had it so loud I could hear it in my kitchen when I was doing dishes! Also it reeks of pot in my apartment because of them.   And to top it off we are bedroom to bedroom so I hear them doing it . ..eeww. It is loud and annoying and they sound like loud horny owls hooting. It is starting to **** me off especially if you wake me up from a dead sleep and I have to work the next day. I want to confront my superintendents but what do I say. . . don't they screen these friggin people. These neighbours are total pain in the a**.    Any advice on what to do.

20090307100735AAppWDv	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Why are my compact florescent light bulbs not working?	I have an electrical enigma. So i went to put new 100w compact florescent light bulbs (They are 100w equivalent, they only actually use 23w) in my vanity.  There are 5 sockets in my vanity and all 5 sockets work.  I had regular incandescent 60w bulbs in the vanity.  Recently I changed the incandescent to 60w equivalent compact florescent bulbs (13w actual usage).  All 5 of the current 60w CFLB (compact florescent light bulbs) lite up and work fine.  I have tested all of my new 100w CFLB and they all work,  but when i plug the 5 100w CFLBs in the 5 sockets, only 3 light up. the 3 that light up don't even light up in sequence.  Its like this OXXOO.  So then i played around with different combinations.      O=working 100w CFLB   o=working 60w CFLB   X=not working 100w CFLB   x=not working 60w CFLB   U=empty socket       ooooo   OXXOO   OoXOO   OooOO   OoXUO   UoXUO   UoXUU   UXXUU   UUXUU   UUoUU      I cannot get the 2 slots to work with 100w CFLBs. All slots are the same socket type and wiring.  All sockets work with the 60w incandescent bulbs and the 60w CFLB (13w actual usage), but 2 slots do not work with the 100w CFLB (23w actual usage).  Can anyone explain?
