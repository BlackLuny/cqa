This switch must be located on the dashboard and must be   clearly marked by a symbol showing a red spark in a white edged blue triangle.  14.2.2 There must also be an exterior switch, with a horizontal handle, which is capable of being operated from a distance by a hook. This switch must be situated at the base of the main roll over structure on the right hand side.    Mise au point mort    9.4 Clutch disengagement :  All cars must be fitted with a means of disengaging the clutch for a minimum of fifteen minutes in the event of the car coming to rest with the engine stopped. This system must be in working order throughout the Event even if the main hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical systems on the car have failed.  In order that the driver or a marshal may activate the system in less than five seconds, the switch or button which operates it must :  - face upwards and be recessed into the top of the survival cell no more than 150mm from the car centre line ;  - be designed in order that a marshal is unable to accidentally re-engage the clutch ;  - be less than 150mm from the front of the cockpit opening ;  - be marked with a letter "N" in red inside a white circle of at least 50mm diameter with a red edge.

ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Je l'aime bien, il est dou.    Mais vous tes vachement dur avec Lewis, il a failli tre Champion l'an pass et ds qu'il fait une faute on tire sur lui  boulet rouge. Il a le talent c'est s?r mais il n'a pas encore l'exprience de la F1, il doit s'aguerrir, il doit apprendre les petits piges.  Je suis convaincu qu'il sera champion assez rapidement il est trs prometteur. Pour son pre et bien je rappelle que c'est son manager. Pour cette histoire d'go, c'est normal, tout les grands pilotes ont un gaux sur dimensionn, Senna, Shumi, et plus rcemment Alonso.    Alors bon faudrait arrter les discussions de bistrot  deux balles, on se croirait dans une cour d'cole parce que finalement personne d'entre vous n'est pilote de F1, personne ne peut se mettre dans l'tat d'esprit d'un pilote de F1, on ne peut que supposer les enjeux de cette situation. Bref j'aime Lewis pour ce qu'il va devenir, mais sa vie prive et son caractre j'en ai rien  faire. Vous le critiquez pour son soi disant go et bien il peut se le permettre, et j'aimerais bien tre  sa place !!!!|`|0f9378d654051e7d5e08d4ad66e11324aa	C'est dommage car il est bon pilote et brillant ambassadeur, les autres ont leur caractre Alonso quand il est de mauvaise humeur, moi je le trouve agrable, en ce moment il n'a pas la russite mais c'est le mtier qui rentre il se rend compte qu'il faut tre continuellement comptitif pour dcrocher un titre qui sera plus difficile  conqurir que l'an pass mais il y parviendra.|`|eeNr7yigaa	oh si moi je l'aime bien il fait bien attention  ne pas doubler les ferrari.. Qu'il continue....|`|K6lfJXVyaa	Non je ne l'aime pas.  Je le trouve hypocrite, arrogant et susceptible.  De plus, c'est un fils  papa qui croit que tout lui est d? et surtout c'est un faux gentil.  On dit d'Alonso qu'il a un sale caractre et qu'il est prtentieux... peut tre mais au moins, ce n'est pas un faux cul, il ne fait pas de grands sourires  son quipier pour le dfoncer ensuite lors d'une confrence de presse. Pour finir, Alonso a fait ses preuves, LUI (et le seul dans les annes 2000 qui a russi  mettre une racle  Schumi).    Maintenant, sur la piste c'est un bon pilote, mais il n'est pas du niveau d'Alonso, Ra?kk?nen ou mme Massa. Personnellement j'espre qu'il y aura toujours un pilote pour lui botter le cul et lui rafler le titre sous le nez chaque saison.|`|LwM2wkvcaa	non parce qu'il a trop la grosse tte, il a dis qu'il sera champion du monde plus de fois que Schumacher (donc au moins 8 fois). En plus je suis pour Raikkonen et le coup qu'il lui a fait au Canada je l'ai toujours en travers de la gorge.|`|axIhzKF7aa	oui j'aime lewis hamilton|`|bEtLguTraa	je n'aime pas Lewis!!! Il a trop eu la grosse tte quand il est arriv en F1. La une des magasines... le nouveau chouchou..|`|vpUY8bhYaa	Il est excellent ce pilote en plus sa copine Nicole Scherzinger ( la chanteuse des pussycatdolls) est putain de bonne|`|pMAQfPDBaa	Lui au moins n'est pas une balance, comme certains...|`|20bKJAkNaa	MOI JE L'AIME BEAUCOUP !!!!   IL EST Dou ET EN PLUS IL EST MIGNON ;)      JE PENSE QUE BEAUCOUP NE L'AIME PAS CAR IL EST Rentr DANS LA F1 DANS UNE BONNE CURIE DONC PAS MAL DE JALOUSIE , IL NE FAUT PAS TRE Dgo?t !! IL A RUSSI A VOLUER PLUS RAPIDEMENT QUE LES AUTRES C'EST PAS POUR CELA QU'IL FAUT LUI EN VOULOIR !!  ET D'TRE DE MAUVAISE FOIS CAR DES QU'IL FAIT UNE FAUTE VOUS TES PLUS MCHANT AVEC LUI QU'AVEC  D'AUTRE PILOTE ....|`|7dc7e04ec5aa8cd186ca8de481ba5b3faa	Non je ne l'aime pas du tout.    Kimi is magic!|`|g54GDocMaa	Mme si il a du talent je ne l'aime pas car je le trouve arrogant et prtentieux, de plus dans certaines situations (Canada France) il est carrment dangereux.    Le meilleur c'est Kimi R?ikk?nen!!!!!!!          :)|`|Ddn4PmRXaa	Je ne l'aime pas non plus.    Tout d'abord je suis 100% ferrari et le dpart de schumi etait triste.    Mais il y a deux trs grand pilote avec des caractres diffrent au volant de ces deux voiture rouge.    Pour moi le meilleurs c'est kimi (trs rserv, il ne critique pas les autres), le second c'est kubica trs constant, le troisime c'est massa malchance l'ann dernire.    Beaucoup d'autre pilote son trs bon mais non pas la chance d'avoir une mono place si performante.    Hamilton et le seul qui se permet de critiquer les autres pilotes et mme ceux a la retraite comme mickael.  Dommage qu'il ne soit plus pilote, il lui aurai montr ce que c'est qu'un vrai champion.    Et pour finir la faute norme du grand prix du canada, impardonnable.  Et qui ne comprend pas pourquoi il a une pnalit au gp de France pour son dpassement, il se fout vraiment du monde.|`|PcagBs9zaa	pr etre clair...je le DETESTE c le mec ki a la plus grosse tete que j jamais vu, srieux je me demande comment il fait pr pass les portes,   une soir people par ci, des unes de magazine people par la.. du people rien ke ?a depuis kil a senti l'odeur de l'argent il a oublie le trou perdu dou il vient; et son pere c trouv sa poule aux oeufs d'or!   j'espere ke ds le prochain gp il va faire un bon accident ki l'envoira directe a l'hopital pr 2 mois au-  sinon moi je soutient kubica et raikonnen!|`|oqjUgeItaa	qui vous etes pour detester le gens ? jadorrrrrrrrrrreeeeee Lewis Hmilton plus que jm .mme  si la france n'aime pas Lewis ... ?a change rien! le bon Dieu l 'aime dj .|`|sZrJ6clYaa	Moi je te rpond de Belgique et j' aime beaucoup Lewis Hamilton. Il devrait aller vite pour me le demander 2 fois, ha ! ha ! ha ! cours toujours ma cocotte.(Il n' a pas fait grand chose au grand prix de France). Bonne soire  Un ajout, il me semble qu' en France vous n' aimez pas beaucoup de monde ?

D'ailleurs au Canada, Rosberg a-t-il vraiment vu le feu aussi???????    personne n'en parle, et est ce qu'il a pris 10 places de pnalits sur la grille de dpart?|`|33e0f4476feccf72fdda3eca70c8bc93aa	NON  Et ?a a le mrite d'tre clair|`|4k6HyyEvaa	je le dteste|`|Hgj2UlA7aa	avec son sourire de con il  l'air de prendre les autres pour des imbciles;on plus quand je vois son pre sans arrt derrire lui c'est vraiment  une sincure   il ne sais pas conduire il lui faut des lunettes pour voir les feux rouges il ferais bien de repasse son permis tout sa pour dire que je n'aime pas du tout cette curie de tricheur.|`|81Psntk1aa	Bonjour  Je ne l'aime pas du tout il n'a rien prouv il a dbut chez une grosse curie et je n'aime pas son attitude, je prfre de loin Felipe MASSA.   @Vanille je ne vois pas la raison de le jalouser d'autre pilotes ont fait des fautes et ont t plus sanctionn qu'Hamilton. Il y a des pilotes bien plus talentueux que lui dans l'histoire de la F1.  En avoir fait de lui un prodige ne lui a pas rendu service.  @Cinq_Mars je ne nie pas qu'il a du talent mais j'aurais voulu savoir ce qu'il aurai fait chez une curie plus modeste.  @Serge je suis totalement de ton avis  @Cronos je sais que tout les pilotes ont un go plus ou moins gros ce n'est ce que je lui reproche mais tu sera d'accord avec moi pour dire qu'il y a eu des pilotes plus talentueux que lui comme BUTON ou RAIKO  leur dbut et surtout dans des curies de second plan  Je ne parle pas du cot humain du pilote la on l'aime ou on ne l'aime pas de tout fa?on on ne le connais pas.|`|tvS6JnbJaa	Moi j'aime pas du tout, je m'explique:  Ok il a beaucoup de talent, ?a on aime ou pas on peut pas le nier.  Le problme c'est qu'il est pas trs intelligent, et le talent  ce niveau de pilotage ne suffit pas.  Autre problme son entourage, en premier son pre trop prsent, il lui bouffe son O2, et lui gonfle trop la tte.  Ensuite Ron Denis idem il le voyer dj la saison dernire champion du monde;  Donc le mec et bien il y croit telment que ?a l'empche d'tre lucide;  Et pour finir il a quand mme un gaux surdimentionner, premire anne en F1 il crit dj un bouquin pour se raconter, il est ridicule, qu'il apprenne d'abord les feux (Canada) que la F1 c'est pas des autos tamponneuses (France) et maintenant qu'il est catalogu dangereux aux yeux des commissaires de la FIA dur dur pour lui.
ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Oui ?a m'a fait vachement plaisir pour Kubica et pour l'curie en gnral, cela prouve qu'ils sont plus qu' outsider pour le titre, c'est une belle rcompense pour une quipe qui progresse depuis la saison 2007. C'est trs encourageant de savoir que les victoires ne seront pas partages uniquement entre ferrari et McLaren. BMW Sauber  aussi redonn un  intrt certain pour la course au titre. C'est une quipe qui a russi  tablir une bonne base dans la F1 ce qui n'est pas facile (D'autre comme BAR ont chou). C'est une quipe prometteuse qui va faire parler d'elle dans l'avenir de la F1.    Une chose aussi  retenir, c'est la rgularit de Kubica qui je le rappelle n'a fait aucune erreur depuis le dbut du championnat, Robert est fiable, rgulier et comptitif avec une bonne voiture, je serais pas surpris que la scudria ferrari lui fasse des propositions. On verra bien.|`|Ykd6UQuRaa	Je n'aime pas les BMW sur la route, j'y suis mme allergique.  Mais en F1, c'est autre chose : ils font ce qu'il y a  faire plut?t que de bla-blater, ils choisissent de bons pilotes (n'est-ce pas Renault ?) et semblent avoir une bonne mentalit (n'est-ce pas Ferrari ?).  Kubica est tomb o il fallait. Il n'a pas la meilleure voiture, mais lui comme son curie savent tirer parti de ce qu'ils ont ! (n'est-ce pas McLaren ?)|`|VVwxoElGaa	Bien s?r!!!    Bravo BMW Sauber!!!    Excelent Robert Kubica, il iras loins celui-l!!!  Ca change des victoires sans saveurs des Hamilton, Raikkonen et Massa.  Voil un saison qui promet d'tre palpitante...enfin!|`|fLCzwgPFaa	Oui c'est une victoire qui fait plaisir car elle nous loigne un peu plus d'un championnat du monde rduit  un duel entre ferrari et Mc Laren|`|p1unDEQLaa	Oui, ?a relance un peu le championnat et Kubica mrite sa victoire.  Il fait parti des tous meilleurs...|`|808e7a409717c5ebcfeb17f3211a750eaa	Ah oui je suis tres heureux que BMW ait remporte au CANADA, et plus particulierement Robert KUBICA qui le merite amplement. C'est un pilote tres talentueux, hyper sympa, simple et fairplay.De plus on lui doit le respect car il a failli mourir l'an dernier dans son crash sur ce meme circuit.  Pour lui c'est un veritable conte de fee.Bravo ROBERT.|`|x4lIR3mEaa	BMW a un trs gros budget !!!!! ils ont d'ailleurs rachet Sauber pour venir et sans un gros budget ils n'auraient pas pu dvelopper une si bonne voiture aussi vite !!    Bravo  eux parce qu'ils font du trs bon boulot, mais merci  cet imbcile d'Hamilton parce que sans lui Kubica n'aurait pas gagner au Canada, Kimi aurait gagn..................|`|nqkjkVOdaa	alors moi je suis hyper contente de la victoire de Mr Kubica!!!!! il le mrite, il se vante jamais ce mec, pas comme un certain hamilton... en + sa change des victoires habituelles de Ferrari et McLaren!!!!!!!!!  flicitations et bonne continuation a BMW...|`|oa6kXeH6aa	plus il y aura de voitures capable de gagner en F1, mieux se sera pour la F1 et le spectacle.  Donc c'est une trs bonne chose que cette victoire de BMW.  A quand une victoire de toro rosso ?|`|GjcUHSjZaa	Je pense qu'il mritait au moin une victoire dans la saison, il ont eu de la chance sur ce coup la car si hamilton n'avais pas betement accroch raikkonen il n'aurai pas gagn. Kubica mrite la victoire d'autant plus que c'est un bon pilote, il a su saisir sa chance, ce que Renault n'a malheureusement pas sur faire. Cela va aussi motiv le personnelle de BMW Sauber pour le reste de la saison.|`|JFNbr9lDaa	Ah mais bien s?r, je suis tout  fait content de voir ce doubl BMW Sauber, cela nous change de Ferrari ou de Mc Laren ou de Renault  son poque. Maintenant il faut que Kubica et Heidfeld confirme leur bonne performance.  Maintenant que pensez-vous si un Polonais devient champion du monde de F1 ?
ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Senna plut?t chez Williams|`|VVwxoElGaa	Je ne pense pas chez Williams...avec ce qu'il est arriv a son oncle, sa mre (Viviane) ne le permertrait pas.  En revanche, pourquoi pas chez McLaren a le place de cette ane batt de Kovalainen?|`|808e7a409717c5ebcfeb17f3211a750eaa	Bruno SENNA pourrait aller dans n'importe quelle ecurie sauf bien entendu WILLIAMS dans laquelle est decede son oncle, avec lla responsabilite indirecte de Patrick HEAD.|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Aprs les "fils de" et les "frres de" on en est au "neveu de" ??? A quand les "cousins germains de" !!!  Je dis pas que Senna n'est pas un bon pilote, je ne connais pas ses rsultats mais la Forumle1 est un milieu trs ferm et il y a dj de talentueux pilotes qui restent sur le carreau alors je ne vois pas l'intrt d'aller chercher le neveu d'Ayrton.  Sinon je pense que Toro Rosso ou Honda sont de bonne curie pour se faire la main. La piste Williamns serait assez irraliste aprs les conditions du decs de Ayrton Senna.|`|GjcUHSjZaa	Senna chez Toro Rosso car Vettel ira chez Red Bull et il y aura une place de libre peut etre mme 2 si Bourdais n'est pas  reconduit, en se moment il est pas tres bien vu par certaine personne qui doute de ses capacits car trop domin par Vettel.|`|0f9378d654051e7d5e08d4ad66e11324aa	Il faut lui laisser une saison de plus pour s'affirmer et viter de gravir la marche suprieure avec difficults comme a pu le rencontrer Piquet, les anciens ne se laissent pas facilement dhoter de leur place bien qu'ils se rendent compte que la relve est prsente.
exOF8iMGaa	Je trouve que c'est bien mais je trouve moyen que ca soit un ECU reli  l'curie McLaren qui soit install dans les monoplaces.  En mme temps il y'a eu un appel d'offre et Magnetti  reffus si je me rappelle bien.(ou son systme n'tait pas le meilleur.)  McLaren connait dja bien le systme donc avanage et il pourrait y avoir de l'espionnage en effet. Mais comme je n'ai pas suivit  fond l'histoire depuis quelque temps je ne prfre pas trop donner mon avis la dessus.  Donc je vote "oui c'est bien ces changement mais ... "Oui mais y'a un risque que les infos circulent vu qu'ils sont proches de McLaren. M'enfin la FIA veillera au grain.|`|ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Ca c'est une bonne chose car cela permet de redistribuer les cartes, en effet le pilotage reprends de la valeur ce qui permet de mieux voir les talents des pilotes, on assiste  un r-quilibrage Pilote/Voiture qui  mon humble avis est plus juste   pour ce genre de comptition.    En fait ce qui est bien c'est que le pilote a plus de contr?le sur sa voiture, cela fait moins "Voiture Robot ou Voiture automatique"|`|NNwLSOG9aa	C'est bien pour la F1 videmment, on pourra voir un peu mieux que par le pass les "vrais pilotes", ceux qui sont capables de gagner par leur talent et pas seulement grace  leur voiture.    Seul point noir, ?a fait peur d'imaginer un Ide sans antipatinage

I hope Natalya wins.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I could care less what the belt looks like, its the competition for it, that is key. Natalya Neidhart and Michelle McCool will have a great rivalry and we will get some great women's matches on Smackdown and upcoming pay per views. Both ladies are very talented and have a lot of great wrestling moves. I think Natalya will win and be the first WWE Divas Champion.|`|IXVLn7z2aa	nataylas a fag bag and i dislike katie lea|`|LSFSfNCXaa	i dont like it,but i dont have to like it its for the divas its cool for them,i think natayla will win, then MCcool will win it after a few months|`|ZPn000hfaa	i think its ugly and michellemccool|`|a2f018f1e31a5ed009c51ebcd7f6385aaa	ughhh. it looks like a little girls hair clip! it doesnt even look like a title! horrible!    edit:im not sure, if it was a fair fight with no help from victoriaor whatever, i think michelle would win!|`|pkLevQ5uaa	It's cool I like the purple part you know who'd be perfect for the title Michelle McCool|`|mWhIGviEaa	That is a pretty bad looking championship idk what WWE was smoking when they made that but anyway I think Michelle McCool is going to be the champion because Natalya isnt diva enough and McCool is so I expect her to win|`|QSfmEXasaa	It looks like something you could buy from Toys R Us.|`|kx4M1nvvaa	that championship has taken all the pride out of winning it i mean butterflies, who ever wins it deserves respect and gratitude but all there getting is the princess treatment i hope whoever wins it will change the face of that ugly thing and make it into a honorable championship like the woman on smackdown deserve  now between natyla and michelle mcCool it's a toss up because they both have amazing talent and it's going to be a hard fought battle but i have to give it to natyla because with the talent and genes she already has i think she has this one in the bag|`|xm7kFnfNaa	It's totally not worth sacrificing the Cruiserweight title over.

I think It's a pretty belt and  I think natalya will be the first to win it|`|F4zFMR89aa	The belt is ugly      Michelle McCool|`|Iqmi9CCRaa	natalya      it looks like a girl toy|`|Aa6U5mXiaa	Nice Belt i just want michelle to win but the most dominate diva is Beth or natalaya|`|Qw7JVoyWaa	it is cool. i wanna get a replica of it. and Natayla is gonna kick Michelle's ***|`|T0aPGs6maa	It looks like something a Bratz doll should be wearing, not a wrestler.    But that's fitting because the "divas" ain't wrestlers.|`|8f09724021ffa37f054c7a99ab3fcc00aa	the belts freakin ugly.  it looks like a 5 year old designed it.  it looks like a belt you would make for a little girl.  anyone who likes it should be shot in th face.|`|RJr0UCK8aa	that title is ugly as hell. what did u say it's beautiful? that belt is uglier than the wwe championship belt. it has a butterfly on it and it's not even gold...wtf
LCqiEYtXaa	Give me five good reasons why Kobe is the best today????    Dude, I can give you 5 reasons why he is not the best today;     1. His attitude: Cries like a baby when things don't go his way.   2. Lacking Focus: Screams "TRADE" when he plays for one of the historically best organizations in the NBA's history.  3. Not Responsible: He blames everyone else for his lack of focus and ability to score points on turn overs.   4. Not Reliable: He gives up when the team is down.   5. Immature: He is not a true leader. (come on, he hid while the Celtics celebrated their win. Any real leader would have come out and showed the team so support and understanding in thier lose.     Plain and simple, people need to stop painting kobe as "the new wave" and accept that he is not that good. In fact he sucks donkey balls.|`|OI5neJB3aa	There isn't 5 reasons- in fact there isn't a single one. Wilt "The Stilt" and "His Airness" are better at everything.|`|ec6XGkjkaa	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kobe is not the best today....... he shot 7/22 in his most important game this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lebron or Peirce or KG or Chris paul should be the best today!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zu9IMGsGaa	1. The NBA sucks.   It's at it's weakest it's been since the end of the Russell Celtics.    2.  It's rigged and superstars are prefabricated.  Just take a gander at all the things Donaghy has been saying, or just watch any playoff game the past 8 years.    3. going back to  2, the League wants it's best player in a major city.  the best players always play for either the Lakers, Celtics, Bulls or Philadelphia.    4. Lakers have the largest fan base in the NBA.  so Kobe has to be the best to appease them.    5.  No defense.   had hand checking been allowed no way Kobe would have gotten 81 points.|`|LR9rvAvmaa	1.hes not  2.he lost to the best team ever in the finals  3.no olympic gold medals  4.can't do it without shaq  5.never compare him to MJ|`|rrfJ5QW8aa	1. 3 Rings  2. MVP  3. Teammates suck but he still made it to the finals  4. MVP  5. Completly destroyed the Raptors  6-100 MVP  P.S. Im pretty much the only one to talk bout the raptors|`|iJwiMD15aa	1. Kobe can score at will but he's beginning to understand he cant do it by himself(MATURITY)  2. He can pass with the best players in the league today with the  exception of a few point guards.  3. He will always defend the other teams best player from the 1-3 position.  4. In his last several years he lays it on the line every night, never gives up..  5..and last but not least he plays the same way whether they're on the road or at home.|`|SN1J3GUcaa	NBA is weakest since 70's ? are you kidding me ? tell that there was 9 teams that could win 50 or more games in the West  in 70's ....better yet .. ever ... when was the last time all 8 playoffs teams won 50 games ?|`|CwTXgy1Faa	i cant i dont think he should be mvp this year i thought chris paul should of won it|`|6RQQ8r7saa	1. He is able to play with both hands and finish with both right or left.    2. He is the best mid range shooter today with the ability to shoot anywhere and in an opponents face consistently.    3-He posses the physical atrributes that make him the best, speed, quickness, strength.    4 He has the mental power and knows he is the best, and always wants his teammates to play at their best.    5 unseen work ethic, which notes why he is unstoppable on both offense and defense, he will only get better in the next 2 years then he will falll off.|`|jSj1YejGaa	too much work for me.|`|KquMXpEXaa	I DONT THINK HE IS|`|SUEBOJmMaa	1- because  2- he  3- is  4- not,  5- fool|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I guarantee they'll all mention his 81 pt gm.  Watch.|`|UadP6GO8aa	Kobe isn't the best today. I'll take Lebron over him anytime|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	kobe is not the best he is terrible and hes five reasons why  1.he doesnt pass   2.he was missing alot of his easy pull up jumpers  3.trying to do to much  4.always complaining about his team  5.and doesnt even trust his teamates|`|nz220kO4aa	1. Best offensive player in the league.i don't need to go his accomplishments.  2.He have that Killer instinct u need from the best player.  3.He also plays defense unlike other superstars.   4.he takes challenge.  5.and his work etic makes him the best player today !
QhKnMqhQaa	J'adore quand on dit "En mme temps c'est pas Federer qui passe son temps  faire des allers-retours sur le court"...  Ca veut donc dire que Federer laisse passer des balles! Moi, il me semblait que quand la balle partait  droite il allait la chercher, parfois mme il la relan?ait, et des fois, ? l'Impertinent, on lui renvoyait de l'autre c?t et il y allait aussi!

f9BRmMNVaa	Biedrins is very good.  He have some of the softest hands in the game and just works so well for the Warriors and plays so hard.  His only bad attribute(aside from his free throw shooting) is the fact that hes skinny.  But he can hurt the opposition on the offense side of the court and that falls rite into Nelly's system.  He also is best at put-backs seeing his 60 percent FG%. Warriors need to sign him long term.|`|7j75DhQQaa	pretty fly for a white guy! but he's gotta put on a few pounds. as a few other people have said more physical players like Boozer get the better of him.|`|zu9IMGsGaa	Very underrated player, but may be a product of the system.  he definately cannot bang down low, as Boozer killed him in the playoffs, but if he is matched up against a running team he does good.|`|Ww36OV7aaa	he is very underrated, he is a solid 10/10 player and will grow to become an eventual 15/10 player|`|CwTXgy1Faa	hes only like 19 and hes really good so i think he will be an allstar for sure|`|nmO3WWbgaa	He sux!!!

If you have to change your shot differently when you shoot 2s compared to 3s you have gone too far. It Takes Time for a sport like basketball.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The greatest "feel good" moment of all-time was seeing Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in the ring together at Wrestlemania XX, both with a World Title, embracing and soaking up the cheers from the fans.    The "greatest" moment in wrestling, but for an entirely different reason, was seeing Shane McMahon on WCW Monday Nitro, telling his father that he had just bought WCW out from under Vince's nose, signifying the final nail in the coffin of Vince's competition.  Vince McMahon's monopoly on pro wrestling was now complete, and that was the day that Vince McMahon BECAME pro wrestling in the U.S.  Everybody else in the wrestling business are just Vince's pawns.|`|LSFSfNCXaa	when vince bought wcw,who knows what wwe would have been like without buying wcw,|`|YWxGVp8Baa	when undertaker tombstoned vickie       or when john cena F-Ued khali at one night stand|`|xm7kFnfNaa	I'd have to say the Hogan heel turn at WCW Bash at the Beach '96.

q1h07j4Aaa	you cant just practice to become a better shooter  if your doing something wrong  your shooting will only become worse as the motion becomes muscle memory    the important thing is to be shooting right- here are some guidelines  there is no such thing as an ideal jumpshot as long as you follow these guides - your shot will be simple repeatable accurate and deadly  you will grow as a shooter and understand why you miss shots and more importantly what you must do to make them    make sure is the exact same release everytime releasing the ball faster or slower will only make your shot worse as you will have problems with your consistency  again i repeat DO NOT CHANGE THE FORCE OR SPEED OF YOU SHOT!!!! why should you have to practice two or more different releases? when it can all be the same with just added amounts of leg power? -theres how to get more range-  instead shoot early in the "up" of the down up motion you make when you jump this is really the key  the earlier you shoot in the up part the more power your shot will have    don't just "use your legs"  make sure you are getting all the power and stability you can get out of them because they are stronger than your arms    a shot needs to be simple and is repeatable  a release that can be used for all types of shots, free throws shots off the dribble set shots runners fade aways shots under pressure and log range shots    when you shoot, push your arm out extending it as far as it can go with your elbow locking --- this is another way to ensure consistency  if you don't push your arm as far as it will go and your arm stops short, you will have to repeat that same partial extension - thus adding variables (or things that could go wrong) and jeopardizing consistency  DO NOT SNAP YOUR WRIST!!!!! or flick it or whatever  it is hard to maintain the exact speed ind force of the snap every time. - this ensures the ball will go straight  the ball will go were yo point your arm every time  the thing you see most nba players doing is their hand flops- they aren't flicking it- theres a difference  your fingers and hand should be relaxed when you shoot  therefore your wrist will flop forward and bounce a couple of times if the locking of the elbow, the pushing of the arm to full extension  don't tense up any part of your hand because you will add extra spin and add variables to your shot  if you tense up any part of your hand or fingers when you shoot.. this action must be repeated exactly every time you shoot if you want to be consistent .. which is nearly impossible  so make sure your hand is not tense almost dead  if your doing this right the ball will go where your arm is pointing since the hand and fingers arent altering the shot    also what helps your accuracy is turning your body a little  in the video below tom is talking about this great shooter and he says in his opinion he would like his stance to be open a little more  thats what im talking about an open stance as little to 15 and as much as 40 anything else is excessive  by opening your stance you'll be able to see were the ball will go because your eyes will be aligned behind the shooting arm- (because the ball will travel where ever your arm is pointing)    shooting elbow placement-  some people like to tell you to keep your elbow in close to your body  but this creates an unnatural tension along the outer arm and wrist  instead keep your elbow out naturally - there is no true measurement on how far out it will go - it depends on how long your arms are      don't change the release due to varying distances from the basket change the amount of power your legs produce    ive said this before but i really can't stress enough how important this is... the earlier you shoot it the more power your shot will have especially for threes!!!!    you should practice you release about 5 to 8 feet from the basket whenever you can.. with no lower body power(or just a little if its not comfortable but make sure its the same amount every time) eventually if your swishing it alot close your eyes and you'll feel a closer connection to the basket and your shot  you should be at a distance where you can shoot it every time and its a perfect swish    don't be afraid to shoot high you should air for medium high arch- 45/50 to as much as 60 degrees  i guess its kind hard to know the degrees your shooting at  but just make sure your shot isn't flat and don't be afraid to shoot it up  if you ever feel you shots will be to strong just shoot it higher or release it later in the up motion of the jump (hang time)  this clip can really demonstrate some of the concepts i have stated  The Swish Method    swish22.com    i really hope you look into the swish method because it really does work and i think is the  1 shooting method ever  after watching them i have a new understanding of shooting  and if you want confidence  this method will give you confidence  what's better than knowing you will make the shot|`|jKi4QgAoaa	go to youtube and type in ray allen tnt fundamentals|`|jDTCRk5Jaa	ok, jump shot is when u shoot the ball at the peak of ur jump, so simply put, it should look like a jump first, then release, just make it smooth. I get pissed just hearing inexperienced players who thinks a jump shot is just when u jump when u shoot, IT IS NOT THE SAME. Ppl  up to say 14 wont be able to pull of jump shots outside the paint, because they are not strong enuf. They will shoot and jump at the same time, which u should also practice cuz its not like ud be able to do a jump shot three, only nba and not that much college player s can do that, cuz it requires a lotta arm strength.    Simply put, do jump shots off a dribble, so when playing one on on drive to the right and after one drbble jump, and once u reach ur peak then release, it cant be stopped most of the time. At first it ll probs feel like ur just throwing it, cuz it feels just like arm strength, but as u keep on shooting u ll no the power is from the legs and u ll get smoother and smoother shooting.|`|MbnhmXCNaa	Just like wen u first give ur highscool sweet heart oral Put the Hand in the COOKIE jar lol|`|CwTXgy1Faa	practice everyday and you will get it perfect    use "B.E.E.F."    b= balance  e= eyes  e= elbow   f= follow through

"Tout le monde peut bien dire ce qu'il veut. Je sais que je suis propre. J'ai suivi le 'Project Believe' de l'Agence antidopage amricaine et je voulais dlibrment subir plus de tests pour prouver (que je ne suis pas dop)", a dclar Phelps, aprs avoir remport le 200 mtres quatre nages.    "Les gens peuvent mettre en doute ce qu'ils veulent mais les faits sont l et j'ai des rsultats pour le prouver", a-t-il ajout.    "Project Believe" est un programme de contr?les antidopage  la fois urinaires et sanguins, qui viennent s'ajouter aux contr?les rglementaires. Les athltes sont libres d'y adhrer ou non.

C'est pas nouveau, c'tait la mme chose au moment de la guerre froide. Alors vous croyez que les Us vont se laisser dpouiller sans rien faire. Ils ont beau se rfugier derrire  leur farce qu'est le projet "BELIEVE", rien n'a chang.

Surtout au niveau arbitrage.  J'ai ete vraiment choque de voir cet athlete agit si violemment et encore pire contre la loi. Ce coup de pied l'a-t-il qualifie pour les etapes suivantes? Non a ce que je sache  mais plutot il s'est fait disqualifier a vie et en plus il va payer pour cet acte. En sport, il faut toujours avoir l'esprit de patience et de "dialogue".  L'arbitre a mal agit mais ce n'est pas a lui de prendre une quelconque decision contre l'arbitre. C'est pour cela qu'il y a toujours des membres jury pour superviser les choses.  Surement que cet athlete regrettera a vie son acte.|`|VM7vcwrraa	Oui ?a fait plaisir mais pas secrtement. OUVERTEMENT    Le seul regret c'est que cet arbitre trinque alors qu'il n'est qu'un maillon de la cha?ne de corrompus qui officient dans les sports de combat et principalement ceux prsents aux JO (Taekwondo, judo et boxe).

WUZbvPGlaa	Bonjour , ta question mrite effectivement rflexion.    D'un point de vue perso (je ne suis pas mdecin) , certains produits sont trs certainement dangereux pour la sant sans compter ceux qui ne le sont pas (pour l'instant) car non-test pour ce genre d'utilisation entre autre amliorer les performances. La validation des mdicaments est trs longue pour une utilisation thrapeutique , il faudrait donc tester toutes les molecules pour des utilisations sportives.    Ta question revient assez souvent sur la table , mais je pense que certains experts du monde mdicale et pharmaceutique pourraient nous eclairer.    Concernant les autres artifices comme les combinaisons pour la natation , il me semble qu'il y a eu le meme problme il y a quelques annes avec les javelots ou les modifications etaient autorises . Le resultat si je me souviens bien est que les stades n'etaient plus assez grand pour acceuillir les concours de javelots . Il fut dcid d'interdire toute modification et les records ont tous t remis a zero.    Pour faire le lien avec mon exemple est que ceux qui avaient le meilleur matriels avaient plus de chance de gagner que ceux qui avaient du materiel idoine. bref la course a la technologie.    Pour revenir a ta question est que les sportifs ayant les meilleurs substances auront plus de chance de victoire que ceux qui utilisent des substances de moins bonne qualit  ( Le raccourci est un peu rapide je sais!!). De plus cela peu entrainer une course aux molecules les plus efficaces avec je pense personnellement des risques sanitaires.|`|871YPXGPaa	si tu autorises le dopage , tu autorises les pays totalitaires  sacrifier la vie de milliers de personnes !!!....car , ces pays ne reculeront pas devant le risque !!!...ils ne verront que la gloire des titres et des mdailles !!...sache pour exemple , qu'il ne reste pratiquement plus d'halterophiles bulgares des annes 70 , en vie et en bonne sant !!...de mme , bien des sportifs de l'ex URSS ou de l'ex RDA  ont disparus ou sont dans tat physique dplorable ....!!!...et  l'poque , ils devaient prendre des prcautions , car si nuls taient-ils , il y avaient des contr?les !...imagine ce que ce serait sans contr?les !.... et , en plus , les mecs propres , ils ne pourraient mme plus concourir !...car ils seraient largus !|`|bcTgD5dFaa	En mme temps t'as raison, il ne faut pas tre na?f, la quasi-totalit des sportifs se dope, soit ils prennent des produits non dtectables comme tu dis (par ex : HGH) soit ils prennent des produits qui masquent les dopants.    Pour ceux qui disent que c'est dangereux je suis d'accord mais est-ce plus dangereux que l'alcool par exemple ? C'est comme tout, il ne faut pas en abuser et faire n'importe quoi avec (aprs je ne dis pas qu'il faut en prendre on est d'accord).    Et puis les sportifs savent ce qu'ils font, en parallle ils prennent des protections, des relances...|`|9cb1ce0c6bef1587a010026aab7aa4d0aa	Merci,pour la question et merci  tous ceux qui ont essay de rpondre:c'est un sujet interessant et proccupant|`|iZviCObNaa	Le sport est fait pour montrer ce que vaut la personne, qui sera le plus fort, c'est un jeux, et si la personne prend des produits dopants c'est plus un sport et sa dfavorise certains personne qui pourrait tre plus fort que celle qui gagne toujours en ce dopant.   Et il faut aussi penser a ceux qui ne veulent pas toucher a cela.|`|DVcq3tSfaa	T'as vu le film live? en gros ce sont des gens qui devant le monde entier sur un plateau tl dcident de jouer  la roulette russe pour gagner de l'argent.    L tu parles de la mme chose, la dpravation de la socit qui placerait la performance avant la sant, ce comportement aurait bien plus d'impactes ngatives dans tous les domaines que tu ne le penses.    ps:  @Nicolas, oui bien s?r, sauf qu'il y a une grosse diffrence entre le sportif dans son coin qui dcide d'outrepasser les rgles pour gagner dloyalement, et le gars qui arrive sur le tour, tient  sa sant et doit se doper de manire compltement folle parce que le dopage est autoris.  Tu me diras que le dopage est interdit sans l'tre vraiment, c'est un fait, mais accepter de se rsigner en laissant le champ libre aux sportifs qui veulent se doper, serait l'escalade, et l'hcatombe galement.  Pour l'instant il y a un mince quilibre que je n'approuve pas, pour gagner il faut se doper, et j'espre que le combat contre le dopage sera pris plus au srieux dans l'avenir, et que le genre de mesure que tu proposes ne seront jamais adoptes.    @Nicolas, attends l t'es choquant, le dopage n'est pas dtect parcequ'ils manoeuvrent au plus juste pour ne pas tre dtect, le fait de tout autoriser, l ce serait plus du tout les mme proportions de dopage dont on parlerai, et comme pour certains c'est toute leur vie d'atteindre la gloire, ils seraient prs  tout, et tout ?a pour quoi au final? h bien que l'on se disent ouai bon il a fait ?a, mais il l'a fait avec des produits dopants. Et d'ailleurs les produits dopants amplifieraient probablement les diffrences de niveau en plus de ?a, il n'y aurait donc plus aucun challenge, t'as qu' voir sans dopage du c?t de la F1 ce que ?a donnait du temps de Micka?l Schumacher, tout le monde trouvait ?a chiant, il n'y avait plus de sport  proprement parl.    "Il faut tre pragmatique", oui mais pas born, Ce n'est pas parce que l'on ne peut pas dtecter tous les virus qu'on ne va pas se soigner, tes arguments sont ridicules et inhumains, dsol de devoir te dire ?a.|`|TRVuc0rKaa	Aaaaah MERCI... Je suis completement en accord avec tes propos.|`|2i2MjTI4aa	Et ceux qui n'ont pas envie de se doper il font quoi ?    "@In girum: tous les champions se dopent"  Comment tu sais puisque si quelqu'un est pris a se doper il ne peut pas tre champion ? Et de plus c'est faux des comptition il y en a  tous les niveaux et du dopage on en trouve pas partout par contre si on autorise le dopage ...    De plus les produit dopants sont des drogues, cela reviendrait  donner un droit de se droguer aux sportifs !! Imagine un peu tous les drogus qui se mettraient  faire du vlo pour avoir le droit  leur dose !!    Et cela ne rpond pas  ma question, ceux qui n'ont pas envie de se doper ils font quoi ? Puisque cela reviendrait  interdire la comptition a ceux qui ne se dope pas !!|`|X1VNZ4pQaa	c'est de la triche|`|D292cqeEaa	Il faut le garder pour le Q!MDR!|`|lk18V20Saa	?a s'appellerait plus du sport !  mais une comptition de droguer et je vois pas l'intrt,   sauf le fric bien sur|`|UxRBPEi3aa	Car si on autorise le dopage dans le sport, il y aura beaucoup de morts et tous les sportifs mme amateurs devront se doper si ils veulent toujours tre comptitifs...  Les produits dopants sont des drogues donc facile pour un toxicoman de trouver des stimulants ou autres choses...  Et si on autorise le dopage dans le sport, le vainqueur sera celui qui se souci le moins de sa sant et donc celui qui se dope le plus...   Un trs mauvais exemple pour les jeunes...|`|oqvYBrekaa	Pourquoi ne pas autoriser les antisches au Bac tant qu' faire??|`|JqbAOZ9yaa	Flemme de lire tout ce que tu as ecrit. ais en tout cas, le dopade avec produits chimiques ne ferait avancer que les industrie pharmaceutiques qui testeraient leur chimie sur les sportif. Pas tres ragoutant ca!|`|kgDu5kgWaa	Il y aurai trop de mort!  C'est bien la performance mais justement il limite la dose pour que ? reste discret, si c'est autoriser aprs un gros effort il vivrait peut-tre pas trs longtemps pour savourer la victoire.|`|fLCzwgPFaa	Et puis quoi encore? On peut autoriser le braquage de banques aussi! Les coureurs voluent au niveau qu'ils ont acquis en s'entra?nant sans dopage! Et ?a c'est juste!

nRSjUKJZaa	They way Favre has been playing, I dont see them making the playoffs |`|XaFYUMRSaa	pretender|`|kgn1r1Scaa	pretender people just care because of jet farve the new york brets suck and so does bret farve|`|GZVTLPwuaa	Pretender, they were wrong in thinking that bringing in farve would change the entire team... the whole offense is struggling and the defense is nothing great either..|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, they are 3 games into the season, and they are 1-2.  They beat Miami by 6.  If the Pats would have had Brady, they wold have been blown out by them just like they were San Diego.  Arizona is up next.   The Jets have to contend with a high powered Cardinal offense.  It is very likely they will go into their bye in week 5, 1-3.  So don't get all caught up in the hype of Brett Favre, in reality, the Jets are going to have a very long road in front of them.  Look at them to be about 8-8, or 9-7.  |`|6D4a6PoVaa	Contender.  The defense is much upgraded from last year, with the addition of Kris Jenkins at NT and Calvin Pace and Vernon Gholston on the outside rushing.  Favre is still learning the offense but should be almost 100% after the bye week.  The Jets were not expected to go anything above 1-2 after the first three weeks anyway.  My prediction is that the Jets have a realistic chance to go 10-6 with Brady going down.  If they do not win the division, they may get the second wild card spot.|`|XSnj1sxAaa	They Fail.. Sorry to say. You  need another year or two and a new QB.  Favre isn't going to get the job done.     Last year packers was half lucky crap *** underhand while fumbling throws for a touchdown.|`|9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	Jets will be watching the playoffs, thats it.|`|0ZqJbmVyaa	No playoffs for the Jets, pretenders.  Mangini just doesn't ever seem to have his teams ready to play, he hasn't proven he is NFL coach material.  I think maybe coordinator is his ceiling, but I am not a fan of the Jets or paying his salary so I don't really care.|`|nCSHqsJYaa	they are definetely a pretender. They couldnt even beat the pats when matt cassel made his 1st start. Look what the dolphins did to the pats. Brett farve cannot save that team im sorry and look what cover game he on Madden 09  cursed lol|`|eaDMLn9Haa	pretender|`|21nhdIXKaa	pretender, i wish they were a contender, then last week i would have made 15 bucks|`|jLOCqhckaa	People have little faith in future Hall of fammer Brett Farve.It's only been 3 weeks,It's a new team,and he got pratically no time to warm up to then in the preseason.I say they don't fail.With the Pat's gone they could rule the division.If not,hello wild card.|`|QsQlZZAoaa	so pretender  to much chese on their taco for their first game |`|EeH97vIkaa	pretender|`|minwYS5Faa	pretender|`|5LEo6EpCaa	Jets aren't really a contender but they can play well.  I mean I think they can go 8-8.  Favre hasn't learned the playbook yet so maybe when he is in week 10 or 11 you can see the real jets. I also love Leon Washington and I don't know why Jones should be their running back.  He fumbles a lot and there is a lot of questions about their defence after giving San Diego 48 or 49 points.  Maybe giving up Vilma wasn't a good idea.   |`|fE8cRBJlaa	even if Brett Farve does get back to form,  you cant win if your defense is going to give up 48 points.  They have to play better team ball, Brett Farve is not going to do everything.  Your offense has to be balanced. Cant keep passing and not run the ball. Of course that will happen if u cant prevent other team from scoring. 
EeH97vIkaa	he is hurt. he has been getting sacked all year and he is having elbow problems |`|C2hp3q5Waa	He got hurt it is a shame that a good QB like him is on a Bad team

Je veux bien croire que Renault avait pens  une intervention possible d'un SC mais j'irai pas plus loin. |`|34U2PicSaa	Moi aussi j'ai une question... As tu un cerveau? Ou es tu si parano? Ou alors peut-tre es tu friand de "complots" et d'histoires impossibles en tout genre?  Car franchement ce que tu viens de dire est surement l'une des plus grosses conneries de l'humanit qu'il est possible d'entendre!  Mais je t'en prie, je suis patiente et moi aussi je vais expliquer quelque chose...  Comment expliques tu que pendant les essais libres il est domin tout le monde (et pas de Nelson Piquet dans les parages!!) ? De plus ,comme tout mes petits camarades l'on dj dit, penses tu vraiment qu'un homme est capable de se jeter dans un mur ou risque de se foutre en l'air?Je ne pense pas non... Et ce n'est pas la faute d'Alonso si Raikkonen, Massa, Kubica et compagnie n'ont pas tait capable de tenir une course correctement ou si il y est arriv des incidents (j'entends par la que Massa n'a bien evidement pas fait exprs d'embarquer le tuyau d'essence, enfin j'espre pour lui). Ce sont des choses qui lui ont faciliter la tache je te l'accorde. Oh! a moins que maintenant tu nous dises aussi que Massa, Raikko et Kubica taient dans le coup? Mais mon petit gars ?a m'tonnerai que Massa qui est en lutte pour le titre avec Hamilton se risque de le perdre comme ?a s'est pass...  Je te rappelle aussi qu'il est possible, je dis bien possible!!! que Alonso est une once de talent et que sa voiture n'est pas aussi pourri que la vieille daube que je conduis... Il est tout de mme double-champion du monde ce qui n'est pas le cas des autres...  Et Briatore n'est pas aussi con  que ?a...  Aprs tu peux-tre un fervent supporter de Shumi et d'Hamilton et tu ne supportes pas de voir le concurrent principal de ces deux hommes gagn un grand prix (je te rassure tu ne serais pas le premier!!).    Bref...  Sur ce je vais te laisser mditer sur cette connerie monumentale que tu nous a sortis et je vais m'en aller avant que tu te dises que c'est moi et le roi d'Espagne qui avons pays Briatore pour qu'un pilote que nous apprcions soit premier!!    Bye bye et j'espre ne plus avoir a faire avec ce genre de discours quand il n'est pas fond et qu'il n'y a pas de preuves de ce que tu avances...    P.S: sur ta "preuve" des discours si j'tais toi j'accuserais tout pilotes qui dit qu'il pense qu'il peut gagner la course de corruption et de comploteur!  Et ti_manolo182 j'aime quand tu dis a ce monsieur nicos "Tu crois que Franck Williams a volontairement sabot la colonne de direction pour provoquer l'accident de Seyna et offrir son premier titre  Schumacher ??" J'aime, j'aime...|`|19bd4117d4beb425118b6e4318706c45aa	H ben. Moi je pense que c'est tres probable. Vous verrez bien que piquet ne sera pas lach par briatore, renault. C'est un contrat qu il lui ont propos ...Ceux qui y voit les conneries, il y a de fortes prsomption. Des comentaires se faisaient tat de sourire  de piquet. D'ailleurs meme les JL moncet et autres commentateurs n 'taient pas prsents  pour ragir apres cette victoire car eux memes voudraient pas cautionner (curieux prtexe de pb d avions retour sur paris). si vous l avez suivi cette emission auto-critique, vous pouvez constater qu il se sont trop attard sur cette victoire (soi disant historique).  Ca parait si norme qd meme!!! en plus un piquet a failli russir le mem coup d tat. Ces gars la on connait leur rputation... c'est comme ferrari etla fia avec leur partialit mesquine. Y en a qui diront a redire.    Ca me semble assez clair , et ce nicos a surement raison. enfin on ne le saura pe jamais sauf si piquet se lache. |`|VfB5VCpEaa	compltement aberrant ton raisonnement....?a tient pas debout  Je pense que si telle avait t l'intention de l'quipe, ils auraient certainement choisi un mthode moins violente que la sortie de piste    Et petite prcision concernant l'arrt soit-disant prmatur d'Alonso : tant parti de la 15ieme place, et le circuit n'tant pas forcement idal pour doubler, l'quipe a prfr le mettre sur une stratgie agressive plut?t que de le charger en essence et donc de le laisser s'engluer dans le peloton....ce qui explique son premier relai trs court    Ta haine pour l'quipe renault te faire dire n'importe quoi......la prochaine fois, rflchi un peu avant de venir polluer le site de tes questions inutiles !!  |`|aL9U5Qztaa	Nicos    je suis convaincu comme toi   Alonso aprs une 15 place aux essais part avec des pneus tendre et peu de carburant alors que l'on se trouve sur un circuit o il est pratiquement impossible de doubler.  la seule explication pour partir avec une telle stratgie tait de prmditer l'entre de la Safety car aprs que Alonso aie ravitaill et avant que les autres ( Hamilton Massa  & co ) ne ravitaillent   Briatore est trs fort dans ce jeu pour estimer les arrts desd'adversairess   donc il fallait un SC aprs le 12 m tour et avant le 16 em , le seul pilote  tre au courant tait piquet.  Il restait  Piquet de racclrer un peu trop t?t  la sortir du virage qui n'tait pas du tout difficile a prendre.  pour confirmation Piquet est le seul pilote a se planter sur ce virage de tout le WE , soit il est trs mauvais soit il faisait partie d'une mascarade  la Briatore.  Alsonso avait beau avoir une bonne voiture en condition normale il ne serait mme pas entr dans les points   Pour ma part j'aimerai  bien que la FIA analyse la tlmtrie de la voiture de Piquet pour vrifier  la manire dont il a racclr dans ce virage    Salut  tous les supportaires d'Alonso       
hhPK1mZ0aa	Mostly likey buy out his contract and let him do what ever he wants. They could trade him but i can't think of any team that would want his wack ***. Marbury  has a  bad attitude and thinks he is the best. He has a 20 million dollar contract, which team can afford to pay him that much money? Even LeBron, Melo, Wade or Iverson makes soo much.

EeH97vIkaa	stewart has 3 TDs this year and he is starting to get more and more carries and he gets all the goal line. i think he is the better start|`|0bNxgPwYaa	You should start Stewart he is running 4.7 yards per run average and he is actually getting more carries than williams.  He also does the goal line carries.  You should definately use him over moss, Atl has close to the worst run defenses in the league.  Check out NFL.com and look for the team stats.  Santana Moss has had a great start this year but he wont be doing that all year, and going against dallas they will provide some pretty good coverage.  Choose Stewart, good luck!!|`|lBbDC8Klaa	Moss, he is a lot better. |`|1e810895bd06aab5a8679d201e717e8aaa	moss is your best option.|`|Exw22FVoaa	moss because stewart wont get a lot of yards or tds because white is their goal line back. |`|OnFRIVeTaa	 I would go with Moss. Campbell is throwing the ball very well and Moss always shows up in big games. I think by mid season Stewart will get the majority of carries but unless you are in a touchdown only league I would hold off starting him until then.

RGQwYDReaa	Your bench doesn't need a particular line-up, they are your fill-in players for the starters.  However, looking at your team, you have 3 total RBs and one splits a lot of time (Felix Jones).  I would advise you to drop a WR like Bobby Engram and look for a RB in your available free agents to pick up.  Felix Jones could be a good point gainer down the road this season depending on what happens with Marion Barber, but due to his size, he likely will never take a full load of running.  It'd be best to sub him out if you can find another reliable starting RB.  Also, Steve Smith is a good player on a bad team with a mediocre QB.  Same goes with Andre Johnson but both players should probably be in each week because they have the talent to find the end zone.  I would take out Bryant and put in Johnson.  Finally, Todd Heap is a good player but is not being used in Baltimore's offense.  Drop him and pick up another TE like Bo Scaife or another available TE that is getting a lot of balls thrown his way.    It doesn't look like you had the best draft this year so use this year as a learning experience for the next year.  In any case, good luck with the season.|`|KTfCJ2M4aa	i would go with the dallas defense, if donovan mcnabb is health, you would think to leave him in if not then i would go with trent.

f0b88b1d1f3ae189a0a4e7c55661baa2aa	This is a black and white answer with no grey area... if this is the only 2 problem your team has your in pretty good shape. Heres what you do.    Carson Palmer: Carson Palmer has thrown three times more interseptions than touch downs this year... and has only completed around 50 percent of his passes. With a QB rating of 64...im not sure if he can get it done, even if it is against the Browns.    Kurt Warner: Kurt has thrown 6 touch down passes to 1 interseption this year, his quaterback rating is 111.7 second in the NFL ahead of Jay Cutler. The Jets are ranked 21 against the pass...and have givin up 5 touchdowns in the air in just 3 games.    Ryan Grant: Ryan Grant only averages 55 yards a game and has 0 touch downs all year...mean while hes going against a stubborn, well coached John Gruden team that has yet to give up a rushing touch down.    Jonathan Stewart: Stewart averages almost 5 yards a carry and already has 3 rushing touchdowns on the year. Stewart is also going against a defense that gives up over 5 yards a carry and has givin up 4 rushing touch downs this year.    Overall this is what I would do if I had your team:    QB: Kurt Warner  RB: Jonathan Stewart    Best of luck!!    ~ Coach Canales ~|`|m5IhBwlhaa	Take Palmer vs the Browns. The play in Cincy and they are playing semi solid bordering horrible. And Palmer played great in a losing effort against the Giants last week. Warner is playing a tougher secondary with the Jets. They are slowly starting to regain their old explosives offense back.    You must go Stewart, hell go Stewart till his bye week cause he has great matchups and he will get his td a game. He is another LenDale White just in Carolina. Especially against the bad Falcons rush defense who gives up 139 yards a game to their opponents.|`|lYJMTe8waa	Common sense would be to start Stewart.  All the Panthers do is Run Run Run.  I guarantee Stewart scores.  The Packers have found their passing game and will use it to often to choose Grant over Stewart.    PALMER!!!!!  I know Warner has been doing well this year and has many weapons....BUT Palmer was getting back on track against the Giants last week AND he threw for SIX TD's against them last year.|`|ZyfwMceNaa	stewart, grants splitting carrys with jackson, palmer, the matchup's better than warners|`|9edf5d40c71316153bd15164c8e8f7a4aa	QB - While I don't think Warner is a bad start, I'd like to think that Palmer didn't lose all that talent in the offseason & this is just a funk he & the team are "working out". I think a break out fantasy stat game from Palmer, Houshmandzadeh & the WR formerly known as Chad Johnson is just around the corner errrrr at home vs a very disappointing Browns team. Brenda Warner agrees, she has her husband on the bench in her fantasy league as well.    RB - Ryan Grant hasn't even got to smell the grass in the end zone this year. start Stewart, I think all that newness may have worn off of Grant or the Favre effect.|`|rhMZTS2Kaa	Stewart/Warner...Palmer is in a favorable match up, but lets wait and see how he handles that.  Warner should be in a shootout with the Jets.  Stewart has been doing well and has what should be a good match up.  I expect Grant to do better this week, but he has to prove it and this isn't a great match up.|`|EeH97vIkaa	stewart has rushed for 3 TDs already i think i would go with him    and warner vs palmer that's a hard one palmer has always done good vs browns but warner has been very good this year both have two great WRs i think browns D is a little bit worst than the jets i would go with palmer

DJyVNzVOaa	Half these people just legitimately don't like cena at all so they give different reasons as to why, and don't care if they make sense or not.     Just being clear. I'm a teenage girl who is not a cena fan nor am I a cena hater.        O and I take offense to the answer one guy gave about all women liking cena. I'm  a girl and not a cena fan at all.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Of course other faces do it. I first seen it with Hogan and it has persisted to guys like The Rock and Austin and Now Cena. A maineventer usually doesn`t have the tech skills of a Bret Hart or Kurt Angle. Not sure why Cena gets so much heat for it. It is Illogical.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I think it's because they find his moves pretty boring to wacth in a wrestling macth. I mean he doesn't really do anything exceptional in the ring does he?      Then again, most fot he wwe wrestler's don't do anything exceptional.|`|7HkN6OGYaa	U could be right Cena is at best average in the ring im not his biggest fan but i got respect for the guy and what he does people blame him about his five moves and his gimmik in reality cena doesnt make those decisions for him only creative and vince does so they should be the ones being blamed|`|QouSk1E7aa	1. HIS FINISHING MOVE IS LAME  2. ALL HIS MOVES ARE GENERIC (ANYONE CAN DO THE FU AND STFU)      HOWEVER WITH THAT SAID I AGREE WITH YOU TO A CERTAIN POINT, THERE ARE WRESTLERS WORSE THAN CENA:    COUGH BATISTA COUGH  COUGH KHALI COUGH|`|RhgB9qnEaa	i don't hate him i was just mad cause wwe wanted to make him like a super human he defeated everyone and held the wwe title for a year and one month (13 months) and that really sucked and bored me that's pretty much the reason most of the people hate him but i just dont like him as a champ|`|anFXbDkDaa	Some of the stuff cena does is out standing.

h6AJ87N8aa	one day run slow and long  the next day, hard and short    you build stamina and muscle without either getting worn out.|`|dec152f261488d8885d5182737464144aa	     I read in a health mag that it is always better to do things at a steady pace. Pace depends on the person. Because too fast and too much can cause undue strain on the muscoskeletal system of a person. A stop-and-go technique is not that good either. Besides isn't that silly?|`|o4o166tnaa	First of all i would not advise 3 fast then walking 3 becuase this is a big change for your heart. If you do 3 fast do 1 at a slower pace just to slow your heart beat down. But i would say a steady pace would be a better aerobic activity.  Hope I helped the best if so please give me best answer.|`|IND3d6g4aa	I have tried doing both ways but I have found that pacing yourself and running consistently makes for a better runner.|`|nItRzl1Oaa	it depends what your trying to get out of it.  Both ways are good, sometimes its best to do a long slow distance, sometimes interval runs are also good. I wouldnt run 3 minutes walk 3 minutes because when you run to get the most of it you should work on a 3:1 ration. Like running 3 walking/jogging 1. So at first you might want to sprint a little slower. Also you could try run at a track so its easily measured and you can do intervals there. Or try the pyramid, sprint for 1 minute, jog for 1 minute, sprint for 2 minutes, jog/walk for 2 minutes, sprint for 3 minutes, jog/walk for 3, sprint for 3 minutes, jog/walk for 3, sprint for 2 minutes, jog/walk for 2 minutes, sprint for 1 minute, jog/walk for 1. Hope this helps:)|`|9Ce0RXJtaa	That depends on your goals.  When I earned my black belt I knew I was going to start the day with a four mile run, the spend the next five hours doing forms and techniques.  I trained by doing both long runs, short fast runs, and sprints.  Decide whats important and go after it.

Take the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins. Then again there is still an undefeated team out in the NFC.     That's right, guess who is still undefeated? The New York Giants and it would be wrong to say the Panthers are the best in the NFC; when they have lost a game.     We cannot discredit the Carolina Panthers and think they have played a well-rounded game this year. However, I personally think the edge goes to New York Giants and the NFC east teams. These East teams have a good defense and to get a win on them; teams have to play their A+ game.|`|6yknPnOVaa	No, and your bragging, because you beat the Chiefs??! C'mon!!|`|lOFgaPaeaa	Good team.

And no, lol, your not a noob for using spring guns. I love spring guns. Theyre durable, affordable, and fun.    Airsoftgi tends to have higher end guns and ammo. For cheaper stuff, I suggest hobbytron if you live closer to the west coast, and shortyusa if your closer to the east coast.      That additional info suggests that you use airsoftgi.com since the shipping won't take too long. Beware of some other websites though. They sell lower quality guns for jacked up prices. Make sure the site you end up using, whether its the ones I reccomend or not, are designated airsoft sites and almost exclusively sell airsoft guns.|`|5ddcc2ddb6513686b8dc9730309b57ebaa	shortyusa.com  |`|hIM98LkDaa	Outside of the list you already know of.

OG4WF1PJaa	He's a fine, fine quarterback. Unfortunately, he'll forever be judged inadequate, because the guy who preceded him played 16+ years without ever missing a start, and was run out of town by an incompetent, idiot,  miser General Manager, Ted Thompson, who now needs to be run out of town himself.    The lack of backup talent all over the team   will taint and cripple the franchise, until the idiot General Manager  is disposed of.    But Rodgers would be fine.  What's terrible is the  id*****t  a***  jerk Thompson never foresaw the need for an experienced backup, so even if Rodgers skins a knuckle during a game, the only people who can spell him are rookies. And we KNOW what happens when rookies play at that position. Goodbye, Ted. I wish you good luck at the Golden Arches, scum bag.|`|XLXncQu9aa	How can he?  First of all, he would need more time in the system to even compare.  Secondly, he would have to stay healthy so that we can see his full potential.  Rodgers is an ok QB.  He isn't the worst, but he's got a lot of playing time ahead of him.  Favre wasn't instantly that good either, because with all things it takes time to work your way up.  One thing that Favre has that Rodgers doesn't is durability.  For some reason, Rodgers is injured just about every year.  He needs to stay healthy in order to be compared.  Also he needs to be consistent.  If he isn't consistent and is making mistakes like he has been the past few weeks, then that question is moot..|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Not even close. He's a bust. I can't believe they traded Favre to give this guy a chance. |`|4hiMgHMCaa	Co-sign with the second answer. He hasn't even been a starter that long and hasn't played that many games to be compared to favre. |`|f9RBCDVqaa	Aaron Rodgers cant replace or live up to a legend. All he can do is try to make his legend just as big.|`|f1HKgd4Gaa	No and as for more time in the system , he has been there for like 4 years already , how much more time does he need , he is a young QB , who has been learning and in the system for i think about 4 years , he should have the Packer undefeated but no , he has lost 3 games in a row and twice at home , it's not looking good |`|6d1c56bb07d8433546ab2691bb56e09baa	Ok, how can he, he's only played 5 games and if you're talking about Favre, he's played what now, on his 18th season!  Rodgers is a decent QB and is pretty acurate and doesn't make the bonehead and typical Favre interceptions when he's playing.  We need more time out of Rodgers to really see what he is capable of.  Look and what EVERYONE was saying when the Packers got Favre.  They were saying the same thing as when the Packers god Rodgers.  I will admit, I was one of them saying the Pack was crazy for getting Favre and having him as the starter.  So, really, give the kid a chance, he as potential here and I really think in a couple years he can be a really good QB.|`|EeH97vIkaa	NO|`|bG1wLELoaa	he might b in a few years he will never be a payton manning or a donavan mcnabb or a brett farve so no|`|zIOKzt7oaa	lol no. I don't even know why people overhyped him. Everyone knew he was gonna blow and made statements like:    "who needs favre, we can win games against minnesota and the lions with Rodgers!! He is so good since he can do that!"    Seriously, the packers ONLY beat the Vikings and Lions. Big whoop.    The Bears beat the Colts, Eagles, and DESTROYED the Lions that the Packers barely beat.|`|nZOAKmuaaa	NO|`|CPeJ3lYhaa	Well, lets see. Arron is in his prime, and how's he doing so far this year.....And Favre, well, he's 39, but leads the NFL in TD's, has a 70% comp rating, and is basically just a stud!    So.....NO!!!|`|6bA4Cls3aa	why does he have too??? is his name brett farve, anyone who thinks he has to be exactly like farve to be the packers qb is just ignorant.

But my absolute favorite is Tampa Bay. Since 2002, they've had one of the most dominating defenses every single year. They are just now putting together a nice solid offense, getting some youth in Earnest Graham. Plus I'm from Kansas so I'm rooting for their young rookie CB Aqib Talib.    GO BUCS!

Team and player deserve each other.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	well, he can't do much worse than perry has done. but, as a chicago bears fan, i can tell you that he is not a very good RB. |`|kIq6SODTaa	The Bengals need someone that can run the ball and Benson is probably the best free agent out there.  He was a stud at Texas but flopped in Chicago.  Maybe getting cut from the Bears was the wake-up call he needed and he will be ready to run.  He can't do any worse than DeDe Dorsey.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	The Bungles strike again. He was over rated and underperformed in Chicago. He can't seem to stay away from trouble as 2 major incidents within a month this last off season proved. Just another action in a long list to add to the Bungles organization screw-ups.

6rFWxMFoaa	Carolina 24, Kansas City, 21. Carolina wins by a field goal. It's gonna be close though.    Chicago 27, Detroit, 10. Matt Forte is gonna kill the soft Detroit D. Highlight reel is going to be beastly.    Atlanta, 24, Green Bay, 10. Aaron Rogers isn't playing. this should be Michael Pittman's trophy performance.    San Diego, 31, Miami, 24. I expect that LaDanian Tomlinson will show why he was the number one pick in most everyone's draft boards.    Seattle, 7, New York, 31. Blowout. Seattle sucks balls and even without Burress I expect for Manning to have a great 1st half. Jacobs should take it home for the Giants in the second half.    Washington, 24, Philadelphia, 21. Clinton Portis should get the handoff a bunch with Philly's great pass defense.    Tennessee, 21, Baltimore, 7. Chris Johnson should get the ball a lot and the Ravens D will be tired of being on the field. Tennessee should keep them on it.    Houstan, 35, Indianapolis, 21. Bob Sanders is still hurt, and Steve Slaton is gonna run all over Indy, who can't even compare to last year's D.    Denver, 24, Tampa Bay, 17. Why would Cutler throw 3 INTs? He will play satisfactory at least.    Buffalo, 27, Arizona, 42. Upset. Larry Fitzgerald will score twice on the long bomb. Buffalo's D is overrated.    San Francisco, 28, New England, 14. Cmon, Miami? Ronnie Brown raped New England two weeks ago, and Frank Gore's gonna hit em where it hurts this week.    Dallas, 56, Cinncinatti, 3. Owch. You're right about Dallas being pissed off. Cinncinatti is gonna get stomped. The Cinncinatti offense is going nowhere. At the most they will get 2 or 3 third down conversions.    Pittsburgh, 17, Jacksonville, 21. Pittsburgh will be up at half-time, then get shut down. David Garrard is going to look really good in the second half. This ought to be a good game.    Minnesota 28, New Orleans, 17. Drew Brees throws 2 picks and one goes back for a TD.  |`|EeH97vIkaa	Panthers  Bears  Packers  Chargers  Giants  Redskins  Titans  Colts  Broncos  Bills  Pats  Steelers  Vikings    |`|JTSNljLhaa	Kansas City at Carolina  KC 24-17  Chicago at Detroit         CHI 20-17  Atlanta at Green Bay      GB 23-14  San Diego at Miami        SD 31-10  Seattle at NY Giants     SEA 23-21  Washington at Philadelphia WAS 24-21  Tennessee at Baltimore   Bmore 21-0  Indianapolis at Houston   Texans 27-24  Tampa Bay at Denver     Denver 30-28  Buffalo at Arizona          Bills 26-16  New England at San Francisco  Pats 27-14  Cincinnati at Dallas                  Bengals 38-31  Pittsburgh at Jacksonville         Pitt 17-3  Minnesota at New Orleans       Saints 24-17  |`|Xdo10FGqaa	sounds fair, but what makes u think the steelers will beat the jags when the steelers o-line and running back is banged up?|`|asmeKlUUaa	Browns!!!|`|BQG15WsHaa	Kansas City  Chicago  Atlanta   San Diego  NY Giants  Philadelphia  Baltimore  Indianapolis  Tampa Bay  Buffalo   New England  Cincinnati  Jacksonville  New Orleans

The Only reason why R.Moss didnt succeed in OakTown was because the line was horrible (only one player remains, since)(LG) and oakland had no QB at the time to throw the ball to moss..    Since then, the Line has improve except LT, the Raiders have the strongest NFL arm in their QB and have a 3 headed monsters in running backs, which has made teams play in 8 men in the box..

EeH97vIkaa	if you do better in the start drills (40 yard dash, bench press, QB drill) you will get a good rating all you have to do is throw to the open WR in the drill its not that hard and the better you are the better agent and if you have a 94 overall rating that does not change who you get drafted to its luck if you get drafted to a good team or someone you like so if a team like the pats, cowboys, etc have a QB they wont draft you only teams that need QBs will draft you|`|b2lDXdL5aa	You have to do the drills better.     good rookies go to bad teams. that's how it works. |`|Qw4l9R68aa	Games section|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	No there isn't... over a few years your overall will get higher the more you play.

dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	1.  Cutler to Marshall.  Cutler has improved greatly and Marshall is probably the best WR in the NFL right now.    2.  Romo to Owens.  TO's complaing that he's not getting enough touches again...Blah blah blah.  Whatever, that still doesn't mean this duo isn't absolutely fantastic.  In the regular season.    3.  Warner to Fitzgerald.  Numbers don't lie, and Fitzgerald has been making Warner look fantastic.    4.  Manning to Burress.  That last play for that offense in the Superbowl was amazing.  Just for that, they get in my top 5.    5.  Brees to Colston.  Yeah, yeah I know Colston's injured but once he comes back this duo is going to light defenses up.      |`|AA10456571	Right now at this very moment..    Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald  Jay Cutler to Brandon Marshall  Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress  Drew Brees to Reggie Bush...  Tony Romo to TO|`|EeH97vIkaa	I like yours but one i would have to add is Delhomme to Smith you saw how steve played without jake it seems like they were made for each other that's what you said about moss brady i think its the same thing|`|e0R0XoDcaa	1. Tony Romo to Terrell Owens  2. Jake Delhomme to Steve Smith  3. Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne  4. Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress  5. Jay Cutler to Brandon Marshall      Honorable Mention:  Tom Brady to Randy Moss    I had to count out Brady-Moss because:  1. You said RIGHT NOW. Brady will not play until next season, and he will probably never be the same when he comes back. You cant just take a year off with an injury and still expect to be just as competitive as before.  2. The only reason they made that many connections is because he aimed for Moss on 90% of their plays (most of which were shotgun formations designed to get Moss the ball every down)|`|rNUyV1EYaa	1. Brady to Moss (when Brady is healthy, obviously)  2. Romo to Owens (when T.O. is happy)  3. Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne (usually)  4. Eli Manning to Burress (even though Plax is suspended tomorrow)  5. Cutler to Marshall.    So, I generally agree with your picks.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Well, Brady is injured, so he isn't right NOW!  He played very little in game 1 of the season, and he didn't do anything.  So for me, right NOW, it would have to be as follows....    1.  Rodgers to Jennings (Green Bay) Jennings leads the NFL in yards  2.  Cutler to Marshall (Denver)  Both top 5 in yards   3.  Warner to Fitzgerald (Arizona)  Both top 5 in yards again  4.  Warner to Boldin (Arizona)  Both top 5 in yards and Boldin has TD lead in the league Receiving  5.  Romo to Witten (Dallas)  Most yards received for Dallas(over T.O) and most yards as a T.E.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	I'd say RIGHT NOW the Brady to Moss combo is pretty ineffective.    Romo to Owens  Cutler to Marshall  Manning to Wayne  Manning to Burress  Warner to Fitzgerald    if you want the whole history of any tandem still playing then it is easily Manning to Harrison.|`|qJaM0AY8aa	yea brady to moss isnt to gr8 right now lol.  1. Cutler to marshall(no question, look at the stats)  2. Romo to Owens  3. P.Manning to Wayne (this week the'll get it rolling)  4. Warner to fitzgerald  5. Rodgers to jenningshe leads the league in receiving)
EeH97vIkaa	There really isn't nothing new in superstar is the same but the graphics are way better and they do have the games best plays which is cool and the announcers are better.

v956FwGeaa	It's a poppy, which is taken from the work "In Flanders Field," and commemorates one of the most horrific/heroic battles of WWI. It's worn every November to commemmorate Remembrance Day in Canada.  (:|`|RbaSVNScaa	As others have said it's a poppy, that Canadians wear around November 11th to commemorate our soldiers. Most people think wearing the poppy originated from the poem "In Flanders Fields" by John McCrae, but it was actually Moina Micheal who responded with the poem "We Shall Keep the Faith" that started the poppy tradition.  |`|s1HBBm3baa	It's a poppy, which is taken from the work "In Flanders Field," and commemorates one of the most horrific/heroic battles of WWI. It's worn every November to commemmorate Remembrance Day in Canada.  |`|0r3UuOBaaa	I had wondered that myself. There was also a Canadian contestant on Jeopardy wearing one. But ah -- poppies, that explains it. I love the poem, by the way ("In Flanders Fields")|`|jFGWP81waa	The poppy is worn beginning on November 1.  Today the poppy symbolizes the respect for fall-in comrades in battle.  It's no longer looked at as only WW1, it is also WW2, the Korean War, the Gulf War and of course wars going on today.  The Poppy represents the respect for those fall-in men and women who put there lives on the line to keep everyone safe.    On the 11th Day of the 11th Month on the 11th Hour I ask everyone to stop and respect those fall-in men and women with a moment of silence.    NCDT Lasher  Canadian Naval Reserves|`|lYnkvRASaa	Here is the entire poem.  It was written by John McCrae a Canadian soldier in WWI.        In Flanders fields the poppies blow  Between the crosses, row on row,  That mark our place; and in the sky  The larks, still bravely singing, fly  Scarce heard amid the guns below.    We are the Dead. Short days ago  We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  Loved, and were loved, and now we lie  In Flanders Fields.    Take up our quarrel with the foe:  To you from failing hands we throw  The torch; be yours to hold it high.  If ye break faith with us who die  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  In Flanders Fields.    - John McCrae     One of the lines,     To you from failing hands we throw  The torch; be yours to hold it high.    is written around the wall of the Mtl Canadiens dressing room.      A beautiful if sad poem.    Edit: it the poppy commemorates Remembrance day in Canada, known in other parts of the world as Armistice Day. It celebrates the end of hostilities in WWI on Nov 11 at 11 am.  Similar to you Memorial day, except we don't get the day off.|`|N1OnviExaa	The train definitely told the truth in this matter.|`|AA11725144	I VOTED?
e2hr1O0baa	It's gotta be Reggie Bush.  That is biased because I'm a Saints fan, but still, the numbers don't lie.  The highest average per return (by 9 yards) and the most touchdowns.  He is able to fully utilize his elusiveness in the open field.  I wish the Saints defense was better so he could return punts more often!|`|lgr5fvJNaa	Bush By Far!!!!!!|`|EeH97vIkaa	Steve Smith when he use to return punts he was a monster and was a punt returner in the pro bowl has reggie done that don't think so|`|95GZRRXHaa	It really depends on what you are looking for...Roscoe Parrish led the NFL in Punt Return average last year. He has been out for a majority this year because of thumb surgery. |`|a6EndAPiaa	It is close between Hester and Bush.  Who is better this year Bush.

kGCd8ioRaa	Good question - probably. Babe was a great pitcher for the Red Sox - whether his bat would have been put into more often in Boston or not - who knows - but one thing I do know is that The Babe became a larger than life hero when he the big city lights of New York.The Yankees probably would have found some talent - but the Red Sox wouldn't have had the curse and would have better success. Anyway - it's a theory that we never be albe to put to the test, but history can be fun thing to think about what could've been. |`|V430UrvFaa	I think their success would have been delayed however, they still had a large payroll and maybe they wouldn't have 26 titles, but they would still have a sizable amount just not as rich of a history though. I do agree that the Red Sox would probably win more titles and would never have that 86 year drought.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Yea they would stil be the most winning franchise ever. I would think that they would have 1 Championship less, and that is the one in 1936 where the "Called Shot" was hit. I feel like that is what really put the Cubs out of the series that season.    Maris, Dimaggio, Mantle, Gehrig, Berra, (It hurts to say it) Jeter, and more have made the Yankees succesful not just Ruth.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	I think they would still have a proud tradition, although the Red Sox probably wouldn't have had a curse|`|sVPjp3dUaa	Not even close. The reason the team has that history is BECAUSE of Ruth. Ruth was by far the biggest draw in history. He put countless people in the seats and made so much money for the Yanks. Without all that money coming in, the Yanks wouldn't have been able to get all the stars they had to continue bringing in more money. I'm sure they would've had a respectable history. But without Ruth, they wouldn't have the 26 titles, countless All Stars and HOF players. The Yanks owe everything to him.|`|N2J9D69Oaa	yes they would. they would still be the most winning baseball team todaay|`|Luy9il9Raa	Question is, would they have been able to develop a winning tradition and get guys like Dimaggio, Mantle, Berra, etc. if they didn't revolutionize baseball by getting Ruth first?  I don't think so.|`|WOcjc6vZaa	Babe Ruth was by far the best Yankee ever, and by far the best baseball player ever.    However, he does own  a huge chunk of Yankees history, he did win 4 World Series with the yankees, however the Yankees have such an amazing and great franchise without Ruth, yes there stadium would not be called the house that ruth built but they would still be the winningest franchise in sports. they have 23 championships without Ruth and alot of great players that shaped the history of the New York Yankees.|`|AA10349169	Maybe    He was a huge influence on the Yankees, so Im not sure|`|AA11725144	easily    reg  mick  maris    so many others    the one thing that would make yanks not have such a history is if they would actually raise talent instead of buy it|`|FtHBUfvDaa	Probaly but the Babe was not the the only person who made the yankees the best team in MLB history there was Lou Gehric, Roger Marris, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Joe Dimmagio, Micky Mantle, (Past)  (future) Derek Jeter, A-Rod, Johnny Damon,.. and plenty more!|`|gu7Gk6Lzaa	Ohh ya the Sox would have not have had the curse putting pressure on them, and just think of Babe Ruth he was amazing the Bambino would have never happened and the SOx might have had the 26 world series the yanks have.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	I know in alot of minds babe ruth was the best, but when i think of the yankees i think of names like Ruth, but there was, mantle, maris, gerhig, yogi, jackson, and so on, so i think overall yes ruth has alot to do with the history of the Yankees, but i also think  the names i mentioned has just as much, and names like Jeter, Rivera, Rodriguez will continue to add to the greatest names of all time that have came out of this historic franchise. As much as i hate the yankees, you can't argue the fact that they are one of the greatest franchises in the history of sports, but i'd be happy if they went on a 20 year drought. sorry yanks fans.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	No Ruth? Are you kidding?  The original Yankee Stadium was called the House That Ruth Built.  Without Ruth, we might not have saved baseball from withering away.  Remember the Black Sox were almost the ruination of baseball's fan base.  Ruth was the cure. The greatest ballplayer of all time. Hands down|`|c6q3EERdaa	History would have been very different if Ruth didn't go from Boston to the Yanks. Some Yankee legends could still be there, but the Old Yankee Stadium wouldn't be known as The House that Ruth Built.|`|AA10554783	you right on that one.
6149747106ff1de5673d8b19c36bf46baa	absolutely, he's taken a horrible Falcons team & made them into the toast of the NFL, he without a doubt this years rookie of the year|`|nH1I4GZEaa	yes|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I am. He is doing great. I had thought the Falcans had messed up by not drafting Matt Flynn from LSU. Boy was I wrong.    BTW: Congrats on getting your Top Contributor badge! You deserve it.|`|MdOHwfABaa	Yes.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Yeah I rem. watching first and 10 and they were saying how stupid it was to think M.Ryan was gonna help the Falcons and so forth well I bet their eating their words now! And Mike Turner is also another great help.|`|VhNmMWbXaa	Wow yes.  They had no offense at all with Vick there.  Adding Michael Turner obviously helps too, but for a rookie QB Ryan is doing a great job.  He has rookie of the year locked up so far.|`|OON0kfqAaa	Matt Ryan is an anomaly.  Very few first pick QB ever deliver the way he has.  The real question is at what rate will he progress and to what level....Im a believer.|`|fCwrLQnQaa	the kid is playing way beyond his years.|`|EeH97vIkaa	Yes i am |`|rLmGgn3Eaa	I am completely blown away. He is awsome. |`|FZuysxp3aa	Yes he is pretty impressive but lets not overlook Michael Turner, and the Defense! coming up big this year!|`|fec7bde9941e38ab22f37cfa5f55bf3caa	how can you not be|`|FmZyN6ORaa	Yes. He will get rookie of the year for sure!|`|vQeKxmZyaa	Yes.  I am.  I can only think of two other rookie QBs to have better first seasons.  Dan Marino and Ben Rothlisberger.  That's pretty good company to find yourself in.
e15591389b5412a49f68af594b2cb15aaa	Defense did alright with the INTs but offense was bad. It is always that problem, offense is good, but defense does bad and vice versa. They just can't get things going.|`|2b1a007863fa10f21afc21a0bfc10306aa	there qb sucks nuts|`|EeH97vIkaa	I am a panther fan and i was very impressed with the raiders but the panthers had like the 16th ranked pass offense and now its probably even lower.|`|f9soMMuiaa	Yes, it shows no matter how well you play or how horrible the opponent is, nothing can overcome the absurdity of the raiders offense. Even Delhomme's 12 QB rating cannot top the raiders' bad offense. 
QW3tkVt7aa	It could happen.  The Panthers have played great this season and their defense is much better than most people realize.  Since they're not a big market team, they don't get nearly the media coverage they deserve.      You could also make a strong argument for the Bucs.  They also have a strong defense and are 2nd in the division in offensive production behind the Saints.      The Falcons have played well and no one can take that away from them.  Honestly, I just don't see them being the best team in that division right now.  Given their 4th place finish in the divisin last year, they have the benefit of playing every other 4th placed team from the NFC last year.      The Saints' offense is explosive, but they have the weakest defense in the division.  Also, if the suspensions start pouring in late in the season, it will hurt them if they are making a run for the division or a wild card spot.      I know the Giants are the favorite to represent the NFC.  I know the Giants' defense gets alot of respect.  However, the Panthers' defense has given up 2 less points than the Giants' so far this season.  I would say the Panthers are a team that has to be taken as a serious playoff threat.  |`|CTbezca4aa	sorry it's just unethical. nfc east vs afc north because they obviously are playing the best|`|KLjfQjVEaa	No.  It will be out of the NFC East.    Although I wish it would be my Bears instead.|`|qov5T21Daa	No, but I think its gonna be the Panthers Vs the Giants in the NFC championship game.|`|EeH97vIkaa	I am sick of everybody saying NFC east the only real good team in their is giants. Cowboys suck even with Romo because of their D is horrible, Redskins aren't as good as everyone makes them out to be, Eagles the same as Skins|`|wxXguyK3aa	There's no way.  The NFC East will produce the NFC team in the Super Bowl.  If anything, the Saints will play in the NFC championship, but lose.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Agree with whom? No one is saying that.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	no|`|4Pe8yZnuaa	No...it will be one of the beasts from the east....probably the G-MEN !|`|KPLDOfxxaa	Nope sorry NFC East will get it
kIfFMYIzaa	It really comes down to Breaston or Colston. Johnson, Wayne and Jennings are all top ten in fantasy points, depending on your format of how you get points. Breaston is still behind Boldin and Fitzgerald so he will never get the premier numbers, however he is getting the yardage due to the Cardinals pass-heavy offense. Colston is coming off of his injury so we still haven't seen his best. He is certainly the top option for the Saints who also have a pass-heavy offense with a good rushing attack as well. Even though Colston doesn't have big numbers, you should go with him because he should come out better in the long run. Breaston won't be able to get a lot of td's either. |`|nuteEejcaa	 well it would come down to either Marques Colston or Steven Breaston in my opinion. but i would say colston because he is just not getting the ball, or scoring.  if you look at their stats, Colston has gotten the ball 12 times while Breaston has gotten the ball over 40 times. And Colston has only 222 yards so far, while Breaston has 624.  And even though Breaston only has one td, Colston has none.  So when you really look at it its an easy decision, Breaston is just doin better so far this year, keepin Breaston will just be a safer bet.|`|c4GE8idmaa	calvin johnson panthers shut him down and he's on the lions|`|1wYx1UrJaa	Pick up Ryan Leaf|`|EeH97vIkaa	Even though he has been doing good all the others are better than him so i would have to release breaston
BIyJUmM9aa	Yes they are.  lol, this is a extremely different team than like 2 years ago, the Hawks are 4 real!!  That comeback from a 23 pint deficient was amazing, and Joe Johsnon is a beast!!  :)|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	I remember when the Hawks used to suck just a few years ago and no one even thought about them. Now I know they will make the play-offs for sure. They have improved a lot, they have a lot of young talent, and they are very comfortable with each other and can work as a team, plus you got JJ who can take the game over like eveyone has seen.|`|YVr6JJNBaa	you dam right were for real. rally from 23 back? Last year, we lose that game by 15. This year, we win. Now we have to get our $hit straight on the road|`|EeH97vIkaa	They were good last year taking boston to game 7 that's real good i think they make the playoffs not sure their ready for the championship yet but in a couple of years they will be|`|AA11700583	Damn Straight!!  |`|MYL2dU8paa	Oh yeah!  They are soooo 4 real! They have improved and now people will see how good they really are! It;s just the beginning of the season, but that mostly determines how hey will play later on in the season!     EDIT: I love ur answer Detroit King!|`|6chLhNJhaa	Nah it's just luck|`|PbrGLvonaa	actually they have improved much... i mean lesser choking and turnovers... teammates reading teammates moves to produce plays... it's ok and we have yet to see their consistency|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Yepppppppp|`|nz220kO4aa	real for 6-8 seed sure why not its the east for god sake.
hFSg8sGOaa	Milton Bradley tries really hard at what he does and is a pretty good all around ballplayer. For the most part we have enjoyed him here in San Diego. He is a pretty steady power hitter who can crush the ball pretty far. The only real problem is that he plays with so much emotion and therefor it could escalate into something bad like when he tore his acl by arguing with the ump. I'd say that the Angels should take their chances with him.You get way more good results from him than bad. Peace.|`|fHxpycJSaa	I wouldn't have him on my team. There's trouble everywhere he goes. As far as I'm concerned, he could take his drama and theatrics someplace else.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Not much to much baggage with a bad attitude,The yankees could of had him 2 yrs ago but passed on him.Another Sheffield to bad he's a great player but if the yankees felt they couldn't strighten him out NOBODY CAN.|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	If manny is not out there bradley would be good!  :)|`|ywYRId6maa	He's good, but he's a jerk|`|VvrqTey3aa	I think he's a possibility. It would put Willits on the bench for depth. I think that Willits can be an everyday player because of his plate discipline, but that's what the Angels would be getting with Bradley. He was 1st in OBP this past season. He's an injury risk, but he wouldn't have to play every day. He'd play DH and the Angels would have enough depth to give him some rest.    Lets say the Angels don't re-sign Teixeira. They need someone to give Guerrero some protection. And even if they do re-sign him, the Angels are still desperate for OBP and would have a great middle of the order with Teixeira, Guerrero, and Bradley.|`|Zqpg4lUHaa	It depends on what angels decide they probably will sign him because you need someone good to bat after Vladimir Guerrero|`|AA11725144	milton bradley = 10 years before actually having a season|`|OM1lNP7jaa	Are you kidding me? No way, Outfielders are the last hing we need. You've got Guerrero in right, Hunter in center, Willits/Rivera in left. What we need is middle infielders. I say we go after Mark DeRosa, Alexei Ramirez, or some other person, not Milton Bradley and his bad attitude.|`|t9DATwlcaa	Didn't he invent the game twister or something like that?     Oh, the player good skills, , but can be a d%$  at times.

I hate bandwagon fans.  And yeah, I'm picky about what a real fan is, too.  To me, if you don't watch almost every single one of their games, know their line-up, pitchers, history, years they won the WS, and some of their all-time famous players, you are not a fan.  |`|CLXTxsoqaa	Philadelphia and Florida.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	The stork brought them.    Now go eat your cookies and drink your milk.|`|c3tADklmaa	The Delaware Valley, and the beautiful state of Florida. Luckily the first and only team I love is the Phillies.|`|4KTe107Yaa	No bandwagon fan here. I've been here in south Jersey since 76 and Philly is the home town sports city. And why havent I been here before this year. Cause I just joined Y/A 2 months ago. Also a huge Eagles Phan  Phinally Phillies Year  E-A-G-L-E-S  EAGLES  |`|AA10047279	It's a silly game. Why worry about such useless things?|`|tLPv8Vvuaa	Apparently NY with how crappy the yankees were this year.|`|AA12182048	I understand you completely.  I absolutely HATE bandwagon fans.  They try to say, "Oh, I have been a (some team) fan forever."  Even though they just got in it after they started playing well.  Here's to all lifetime CUBS FANS!!!!|`|orabzb0Naa	I have been a Phillies fan since 1967, when I was ten years old.  Really, I was a fan earlier, but when I was ten I really started to follow the team and understand the sport.    I dont agree with how you want to define the term, "baseball fan".  I respect that it bothers you.  It also bothers me when I hear a guy call sports talk and they dont know what they're talking about.  On the other hand, I think if a person is enjoying being a "fan" in their own way, then more power to them.      I think some people feel snubbed and intimidated if they dont know alot, and back off from being a fan.  I try to include the unknowledgable, and encourage them to be fans.  (and put up with their ignorance)|`|a83e06c1975c4b22273afd0ccbdf1ccfaa	They came from their mothers.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	The downside to the accusation that someone is a bandwagon fan is that you can't tell for a while.    When people come out of the woodwork, they may have been supporting their team all along, but simply never asked questions or answered questions because no one had inquiries about that team.    A bandwagon fan though, is someone that jumps on when they win and jumps off when they don't.    So, if you have a list of any yankee fans that aren't anymore because they didn't make the playoffs, then, it's a bandwagon fan.    or anyone that doesn't like the Red Sox anymore because they didn't win the world series this year.    You won't be able to tell the Phillies and rays bandwagon fans until much later.    But it still doesn't bother me.   I don't care if someone has liked a team for a day, a year or a decade.

They have had talent all over for many years, but they couldn't even make it happen with Barry on their team.  Management will keep that team in the cellar.  And CP was once upon a time a good QB, but now he has a hard enough time holding onto the ball before he even has a chance to throw it.  CP is one of the biggest butterfingers in the league.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	Let me do the math, if i get this right you give me ten points  Lion vs Bear 23-27 THAT 4 POINT  Bear vs Titan 14-21 that 7 point MULTILY =28  Pack vs Titan 16-19 THAT 3  VIKING VS TITAN 17-30 THAT 13    36+28=64/4=26    Lion will lose by 26 point|`|4FyJM8hhaa	That would be hilarious if that happened.|`|iEj6EXbMaa	I was thinking the same thing.....everyone thought I was an idiot when i said Iowa would beat Penn State Saturday (and i attend PennState)    When a team gets overconfident, they lose    I am definately betting DET + the points  now a moneyline is foolish.....I think Tenn will win    but i would not be suprised at all if DET win    Confidence is a double-edged sword.|`|IuNbBWsRaa	I'm with the gallery...

However, I will say that (to the person who said Calvin Johnson will be shut down) NO ONE IN THE LEAGUE can shut down Calvin Megatron Johnson...he is just an absolute Freak (capital F).  It is unfortunate that he plays for the worst NFL team, but he is one of the absolute BEST wide outs. Megatron 4 Life.|`|5BWHTiIiaa	21-3 Titans

exz7IPrdaa	Delhomme is not a good QB. But he hides it well. I wish we could trade his *** in the offseason. He is very fortunate he has some top notch players around him to make him look good. Take a look everytime he makes a bad play he throws a fit and acts like its not his fault.    It's gotten old.    He has lost so many games for us over the years single handedly by making bad decisions in the 4th Qtr.    The game yesterday against Oakland would have been a loss were it not for special teams and our stout D.    So yea he is DEFINITELY overrated.    |`|rNUyV1EYaa	I have to say Delhomme and Carson Palmer, for sure.    Romo? How many undrafted free agent QB's started their careers 23-9? Eli Manning was a number one draft pick and it took over four years for him to win anything.

Ou beats tech and it casuses a three way tie in the big 12 south casuing ou to get into the big 12 title game. God I hope not I hate oklahama. I loved it when they got whopped by sc in 2005 in the title game and everyone was saying how great oklhama was. Usc is the second best ( a bit over my longhorns) becase of their d. They will CRUSH penn st in the rose bowl by only 21 points.

x9GODf8eaa	First off, whoever said Vancouver is going to win the northwest, come on...lets be reasonable here.    If the Flames are going to have any chance of winning the NW, they are going to have to start playing better defense again, and fast. Yes, they won last night, but giving up 6 goals (including 2 shorties) is not acceptable. The hung Kipper out to dry on just about every goal. Like the last one. Weber (a defenseman) was allowed to glide into the zone, untouched and put it in. A defenseman! on the flames own powerplay! Brutal.     Minnesota is a team based upon defense. It has been said that offense wins games, and defense wins championships. I'm not sure if I agree completely, but there is definitely some sense there. In the long run, Minny's defensive style is solid, they are rarely going to let in 3 or more goals. The flames offense is playing very well, but there it is always a chance that the tap could run dry.     I say the Flames win it if guys like Iginla, Bertuzzi, Cammalleri and Langkow continue their good play. But its going to have to be a team effort.    So my standings look like:    Flames  Wild  Oilers  Canucks  Avalanche|`|i4XDfijnaa	1. Wild  2. Flames  3. Canucks  4. Oilers  5. Aves    |`|6jBoFeTLaa	I see the Oilers taking it  In my dreams I see the Avs taking it  lol|`|AA11725144	I say this    1 wild  2 flames  3 oilers  4 avs    .... where are the canucks? im a wild fan...

Giants|`|jb5JMiIzaa	NO|`|hPqqNFuYaa	I'd love to see it happen 2 years in a row.  They definitely have a good chance if they keep it up.  They still have a brutal schedule the rest of the way.  All against potential playoff teams.  And all it takes is one bad playoff game or going up against a hot team to knock them out.|`|PVtdJKylaa	of course they "can" ... geez, they're 8-1 and way ahead of the rest of the conference... tryin' not to go too far out on a limb there eh?     "will" they? yes i think they will, because dallas has imploded, washington is overrated, and philly just showed they cant hang with the giants. the rest of the NFC is a joke. well ok GB has a good game here and there, and tampa is ok, but we saw where that got them last year...|`|6tGYe5roaa	The definitely can. They are 8-1 and have been playing really good, solid football. They have the talent, it is just very difficult to get into the Superbowl two years in a row.

63b3e2c6e6c929c985912a3967d33880aa	Just a few suggestions.....  1.ALWAYSE stay low(at tryouts)   2.NEVER walk to where you are going RUN!!!!!(tryouts)  3. when your coach is talking always reply with "Yes Mama" or "No Mama"(they love when you are polite)  4. where BRIGHT colord shirts to tryouts, it will make you stand out and it will cetch the coaches atention.  5.SUCK UP to your coaches when they need help, be the first to volentere.   6.DONT EVER EVER GET COCKY!!!!!(it will corupt you)     eat helth, go to bed earley(the sleep that you get in the night(9-12) is better than the sleep you get in the morning(1-7) ).go running every day! Depending on what grade you are in you will proboly be running in your tryouts. do wall sits(back agenst the wall like you were sitting in a chair your legs at a 90 angle and hold it for 1min and then build up the time, you will be sore if you do it right) at your house while watching t.v. or reading a book. Do crunches and pushups. run 2 miles every day.    I know that none of that had to do with volleyball kills but that will surlly help you with your try-outs, and im sure that what ever skills you have been working on are good just maby push your self a little harder.    I hope try outs go well!!!!! let me know how you do!!!!!   |`|OPzH4ih0aa	Just keep practicing. All you can do is your best.|`|oPjIIywaaa	in volleyball...    well you can practice more, on your movements  to feel comfortable in the court    have a good mood  in tryouts you must give all your best to get in the team    all you can do is to still practice, but with not pressure  and dont get panic    good luck!!!|`|pomyVWrKaa	What are you trying out for?|`|I1ayVf0Iaa	get some friends together and set up so that you can practice setting digging and spiking.the more you do it the easier it gets and you will be more familiar with everything.|`|QRSnfvmzaa	practice on your weaknesses. If one of your friends are trying out practice with them.
QtjnmEzoaa	I think it is because all of the additions they are making to supposedly make the defense better were all backups for other teams. (Wasn't Gay the 4th CB for the Pats last year?) They also picked up Jason David from the Colts after the Superbowl season. He got beat out for his starting job during the playoffs. If they're not good enough for other teams, why should they be good enough for the Saints? A second-team defense is going to get burned to a crisp by a first-team offense any day. Unless they're playing the Raiders.|`|KTp27Fokaa	I really dont get how they had 530 offensive yards yestarday and only 20 points.    They are an awful defensive team. They havent been good on defense in years, even theyre NFC Championship year wasnt that good of a defensive show.|`|58TDAT1zaa	Not everybody can be at the top of their class.  Someone has to graduate last.|`|XFF9qZ6haa	To be a Saints fan is frustrating. not because we don't have any talent but because they just don't know how to use it sometimes.     Its also not all of their fault they have had WAY too many injuries.    What makes it ironic is that we have one of the best offenses in the league but once again because our defense can't perform as a TEAM!    WE had had issues like this years ago and I thought they were gone but apparently NOT.     We have so many talents on the team and they just need to learn had to mesh them all together!!!!!      ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THANK GOD WE ARE OUT OF THOSE AIN'T DAYS!!!!!!|`|gSgYDAEAaa	Well lets see Porter had a season ending injury so he hasn't played in awhile. He was playing pretty good for a rookie until he got hurt. Glenn is not the same as he used to be. Gay is decent and David is the worst corner in the league. Everyone knows they have the worst secondary in the league.|`|EeH97vIkaa	I don't know because i am a panther fan|`|j5ttyh3Caa	haha, i am not a saints fan, i am a vikings fan,  that game was great.  TWO SAFTEYS!!!|`|WQJJaPDuaa	I honestly would not know, I like the falcons.      Yes, The Saints did have 520 total offense and only 20 points, 422 was passing.  The reason for that was because 1) Brees was intercepted 3 times- twice inside 5 yards til a Td.  2) Brees threw it 58 times- completing 31.  He also threw for around 200 in the 4th quarter alone, because he threw every play.      He also padded his stats by throwing a hail mary- when he was down 3 scores, with :05 seconds left- and scoring a td.  He could have just kneeled.    Anyway, the main thing that hurt the saints yesterday was their inability to run.  The falcons forced them to become one-dimensional, and there pass rush was wreaking havoc, forcing the three INTs.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Being a Saints fan HAS to beat being  Lions fan.  Sigh.

Look at how poorly the Panthers played against the RAIDERS. The Panthers are in for a rude awakening after next week against Detroit. Five of the remaining seven games the Panthers play will test them. I'll predict they go 10-6 or 9-7 if the Giants show up with their 1st string players in week 15.|`|qGZzW0LPaa	Panthers.    I think the Lions will go defeated this year. (0-16)|`|2rmr5fLcaa	panthers|`|k6u1Kka0aa	Panthers by 28 at least.|`|hPqqNFuYaa	Panthers should win easily.  They're a tough team to figure out though.  They'll look great one day and then look lousy against a poor Oakland team like they did today.  4 INTs for Delhomme?  That was rough...|`|kQ6hhXDXaa	panthers. lions are not just the worst football team in the league, but the worst sports team in the world. steve smith is going to have a huge game, as will deangelo williams and jonathan stewart. i don't know why the lions bother to even show up to these games. just continue to stink and get the number 1 draft pick next year. i hope the lions go 0-16. |`|MdOHwfABaa	Hm I wonder.|`|sNTSkQ1haa	There is no point in asking this question... the lions are the worst team in the past 5-10 years.  Just because Delhomme isn't the greatest, doesn't mean its going to be close.  Detroits defence is terrible too.  Carolina will win by at least 14 points. AT LEAST!!    PS. Carolina is 7-2, Lions are 0-9.  I'll take Carolina.|`|C5DfzJ4Jaa	umm... Panthers play Titans next week... Not lions.|`|iuJqnJxxaa	patriots will win|`|gu7Gk6Lzaa	Um the person that says they play tennese next week is wrong they play them in 3 weeks   Well you just look at the record first   Panthers 7-2  Lions 0-9  Then pass yards  Panthers 1765  Lions 1691  Russing yards 573  Panthers 1073    Just Look at the stats Panthers r gna be 8-2 and Lions r gna b 0-9  Lions

9ee6ddc38b0329a7f432890bc9b58804aa	I like the classic Unis like Bears, Browns, Raiders, Jets, Cowboys, etc.     Some of the new unis are cool but others look too weird and not like football uniforms:  Panthers, Chargers, Seahawks (all green/blue), Ravens (purple is for girls and all black is boring see: Falcons, Jags)  Vikings in all Purple, Texans in all Navy and especially all red, Titans in all Navy or all Light Blue, Patriots in all Navy, Rams in all Blue, Cardinals in all Red.    The thing that bothers me the most though is:  ALL THE WHITE HELMETS!  This is the NFL NOT pop-warner you can afford to put some color on your lids!    (Chargers, Titans, Jets, Dolphins, Bills Throwbacks, Cardinals,) would it kill them to put a team color on their domes?    And after that what is with all the silver and black helmets? More originality from:  (Cowboys (get a pass cause they are older then the other franchises), Raiders (also get a pass for keeping it the same for so long), Falcons, Jags, Patroits (wow switched from white to silver!), Lions, Panthers, Buccaneers like the pats made the switch from colorless white to colorless gray!, at least its dark gray).|`|3cOsbOmQaa	bengals best and eagles throwback   browns,redskins,and dolphins|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	The best uniform in the NFL is the Raiders uniform and the worst goes to the Carolina Panthers.|`|7j75DhQQaa	best - Redskins and also powder blue Chargers  worst - Browns and Jets (I have no love for Brett)|`|6Efhd6lNaa	Best- Black Ravens, Cardinals, Eagles Throwback, Redkins Throwback, Seahawks    Worst- Browns, Redskins regular, Bills|`|qZLSMccqaa	Best--Patriots when they lose.

So I guess if Eli Manning blows his knee out next week they will still without question go to the Super Bowl?|`|XuGFt3boaa	The Giants are a shoe in to make it to the Super Bowl again.

The Giants are looking pretty good.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	Definetly, I cant name one team in the NFC that can beat them right now.
ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Glock n'a certainement pas laiss pass Lewis parce qu'il ne l'aime pas, il a pari en gardant ses pneus mais la pluie s'est amplifie, Glock a essay de tenir sa position d'ailleurs il a tourn plus vite que Trulli qui lui aussi avait gard ses pneus. Mais le manque de Grip vident  permis  Vettel et  Lewis de le doubler.  Les trois derniers tours :  Trulli: 1min22s428, 1min33s539, 1min44s800.  Glock : 1min18s688, 1min28s041, 1min44s731.

Kubica alors 16eme le tour de retard, cherchait  le faire une erreur, voire dans cette tentative on avait l impression qu il voulait lui rentrer dedans. Vettel n avait que cette objectif de lui renvoyer  a la 6e place, et avec l aide de kubica qui gene LH en le depassant pour quoi ? une 16e place. C a cette faveur que vettel passe. La pluie, s y est mis, ils manquaient que l'ouragan. Mais tu as triomph. parceque ce meme Glock ne pouvait rien faire contre toi sinon de bloquer aussi vettel. Le dmon pris a son propre piege.

The Yanks are going to go all out for Sabathia. They need pitching more than hitting and already have a glut of OF/DH players to rotate.    Pettite will resign and Moose will as well, if he does not retire.    The Yanks may try to get Burnett as well, but it would be a big mistake because he breaks down easily and it a contract-year player

Of the teams in the nfc that have a decent shot at the superbowl (the Giants, the Redskins, the Eagles, the Cowboys, and the Panthers), only two have any real playoff experience (the Giants and Eagles) and I'm sticking with my preseason prediction of the Cowboys being the only NFC East team to miss the playoffs.  The Panthers have been surprising but have no experience and a weak running game, against a team like the Redskins or Giants in the playoffs they wouldn't stand a chance.  Basically I think it comes down to the Giants and the Eagles in the NFC as I see the Redskins making an early exit and the Panthers only having a small chance of winning it all. The reason I chose the Eagles is because lately it seems that everyone who has failed in the past (besides the Cubs) has been winning lately (see: Red Sox, Peyton Manning in the playoffs, Eli Manning in football games, the White Sox, the Rays, even the Celtics). Also no one will take the Giants lightly in the playoffs this year, and I can't see Eli Manning pulling off another miracle run to repeat.  And this just isn't the AFC's year, the Titans will choke with a quarterback that doesn't know how to lead a team and once the defense falters even slightly, the Titans lose. |`|hGMDoI3Faa	the giants  ooooooooo yea baby

RKEdWWEyaa	Unfortunately Mongo is incorrect in this instance. While normally it is possible to purchase a long gun from the US and ship it back to Canada with only a reasonable amount of frustration and Tariff's,    An M24 whether you actually acquire a genuine one from Remington, or you have someone like Knight's or another gunsmith build you up a Custom M24 clone from a remmy 700 action, is definatley going to be classified as a Military style weapon (obviously) and you will definately not be allowed to ship it back to Canada. While the idea of owning an M24 or something close to it sounds like an insanely expensive dream come true, the closest you will probably be allowed to get back home with is a Remington 700 PSS in .308, which is the police/sharpshooter model of the 700. Its about 75 percent of the M24 at about 20 percent of the price and its a sub-moa shooter out of the box.     Besides with the right glass (Leupy Mk4 10x fixed magnification) if you wanna really be authentic, and the right ammo, you will never even be able to come close to shooting the gun anywhere near its full potential anyway.    *m24 or anythign custom built and stamped or indicated by name as m24 or m40 or sniper etc. is almost certainly banned either by name or definition for use in Canada. Remmy 700 built up the right way if probably your best bet.|`|oeOxZauAaa	Yes it can be imported but not shipped.   An application for importation must be made with the destination province (IE: Quebec). There is $150 charge for the importation and registration fee and the processing time varies between 4 and 6 weeks. Upon approval the firearm must be presented to a Customs Official at the nearest port of entry and verified. Then it may be brought in to Canada.  |`|AA11811007	its a weapon what do u think?

VBHOiIBlaa	They do that to pin the recieving team deep inside thier own territory, as no one is back to recieve the punt.     It has some advantages, you will see it about a dozen times a year in college, and maybe 1 time a year in the NFL.    www.ratedpicks.com|`|MPDgKgIxaa	To surprise the receiving team, no punt return.    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  |`|EeH97vIkaa	probably because the D will think they are going for it and there will be no return man so they can try to pin deep or have no chance for return|`|77G4KS0Uaa	It depends on the situation.  In terms of Texas vs. Texas Tech, Mack Brown probably told Colt McCoy to pooch punt (that's what it's called) if he didn't like their chances of getting a first down against the defense that was being showed.  It was 4th and 8 I believe...    Other times, it's purely for deception in an attempt to pin the opposing team deep in their own territory because they don't have a return man deep.  I saw Randall Cunningham pooch kick over 70 yards one time against Dallas I believe.

2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I believe what you might be referring to is the national disaster initiative that the military, FEMA, and other federal and state agencies are working on for dealing with large scale things like hurricanes.  Unless martial law is declared the military when they are requested or tasked to render assistance still has limited powers in so far as law enforcement goes as well as limited authority and power in other things.  Some planning has been going on regarding this and how best to deal with situations while not denying people their legal rights.  They recently stood up two special units that will have specialized training and certain authority that the rest of the military does not have except for the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard was the only service that had seizure and arrest powers unless martial law was declared until these two units were set up.  The military and especially the national guard has been tasked so much recently due to earthquakes, hurricanes, and forest fires that it is only a matter of time before you have a situation again like New Orleans.  While the military was standing by waiting to be called in even if they had been they would have been limited as to what they could do and how they could react.  Called in on Hurricane Rita much earlier they were able to much better handle the situation but were still limited in some ways because martial law was not declared.  This planning and these specail units are an effort to better handle such a situation and at the same time not usurp the civilian authority or expose the military to lawsuits afterwords for something they may be requested to do.  During  my military career I worked in the place that had tasking authority over all the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and National Guard Wings for airlift and we worked on these things as well as the war and other things you hear about on CNN on a daily basis and I worked personally on both Katrina and Rita.|`|kMH378pPaa	There was a TV show a few years ago that went by that title, it only lasted about 3 seasons I think.|`|cnkY7ullaa	Martial Law was talked about when it looked like the Bailout might not happen.  If banks totally froze and the economy shut down, you might find yourself in a free-for-all situation.    It is only used in extreme situations. It would be like living in Iraq right now.|`|nsOHYw8Qaa	I live in a town that is maybe 4,000 pouplation... why is there a new swat truck sitting next to the new courthouse? maybe we should research how much construction is going on. The new jail in my town is huge.   Dont waste your time watching youtube vids about it cause i saw them all. there is alot of consiracy theory out there.   The only way we are gonna know is when we start seeing military everywhere. in that situation, i am joining because i dont wanna end up in a fema camp. Better off on the right side...|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Martial law as in when the military is in total control? Yes, I have heard of it and it has nothing to do with martial arts.    The Constitution protects us from such things except in times of national emergencies in which the writ of habeas corpus is suspended. The Constitution states that the writ of habeas corpus will NOT be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it. Since we are neither in a time or rebellion nor invasion where the public safety requires it, there will be no martial law in the United States... It still doesn't have anything to do with martial arts.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	What supposed martial law? You gave no description.|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	Martial Arts?|`|as6GsEnGaa	Marshall Law is my favorite Tekken fighter. |`|LnJjS8BRaa	BWUAHAHAHA, SAMMO HUNG!    Martial Law exists and can be invoked by the Government under extreme circumstances. In the US the most noteable measure during Martial Law is the suspension of habeas corpus, an important right that helps protect the individual freedoms of individuals against arbitrary State action.
Vp3RrTpeaa	I would go with Albert Pujols because he gets more walks and bats for a higher average and tends to strike out a lot less. Pujols also has one thing A-Rod doesn't a ring. Besides Pujols is my fave player.|`|V430UrvFaa	Interesting question, don't know who I'd rather take, I like consistent players so I'd go with Pujols. There are so many other options at third base in the MLB and having a good all-around first baseman is a great asset.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	A-Rod if he isn't in New York|`|N2J9D69Oaa	albert would be the better choice. but hes injured too much. so i would go with arod|`|wmYnJd2jaa	It depends on the length of the deal.    If it was just for next year, I think I would go with A-Rod. More valuable defensively to go along with huge offensive numbers. However, if it was more than a one year thing, I'll take Pujols. He's just entering his prime years, while A-Rod is due to start winding down in the next few years (relatively speaking).|`|VvrqTey3aa	A-Rod is better. He plays a tougher position, hits for better power, and he's much faster.    People always say that A-Rod sucks in the postseason, but if he played for a slightly smaller market like St. Louis, he'd be a lot better in October. In 1999 with the Mariners, A-Rod batted .313 in the playoffs. In 2000, he batted .308 in the ALDS and .409 in the ALCS.    Pujols was a defensive liability in the outfield and at third base when he came up to the majors. He had to be moved to the easiest position in baseball. A-Rod can play at close to a gold glove level at shortstop and third base. He has much better range and a stronger arm.    A-Rod also hits for more power. He's hit at least 35 home runs every year since 1998. He's really consistent. Pujols is great, but A-Rod has the better all-around game.|`|c15b7cf7823d7ed814638046f71d7eabaa	Pujols|`|mlU5u7Nfaa	Career: Alex-Rod  Now: Albert Pujols     Reason I chose A-Rod for career is because.. well, he amazing when Pujols wasn't even playing yet. Pujols has been raking since he hit the bigs, and Alex is just too much of a bust under pressure. Albert can hit anywhere, anytime in the clutch|`|Luy9il9Raa	Pujols by a hair.      On one hand, Arod is a better fielder at a more demanding defensive position, but on the other hand Pujols is still a better hitter and doesn't come with as much baggage.|`|AA11725144	no choice but to go with both... clean respected future hall of famers.. great community leaders... but Arod arod arod why settle for maddonna|`|cTbjhY87aa	a combo of the 2|`|t803rm2iaa	With the numbers Pujols put up this year its hard to pick a rod|`|gu7Gk6Lzaa	I would have to go with Pujols especially since A-rod has not been so hot lately and Pujols batted .357 last year and A-rod batted .302 you see the difference maybe arod will do better with the new stadium who knows|`|sHzPnGXHaa	pujols|`|c6q3EERdaa	Pujols. He's the kind of guy, on and off the field, that you'd want to have.    A-Rod's roiding, and who would want to have a player who's really selfish?|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	I like Pujols but Arod is the best player in the game, why do you think he is the richest player in MLB|`|cpZ229Geaa	pujols, and i think you mean KRod
J9fxTGwKaa	omg were doing this in social studies right now too!!! well, the federalists wanted a strong central government  while the republicans wanted a smaller localized one. federalists wanted power to the national government with a big national bank and republicans wanted power to the states and small local banks. republicans wanted agriculture to be the base of the economy and federaelists did not. jefferson was a strict constructionist which meant that he did not allow exceptions to the constitution and hamilton, the federalist representative at the time, was a loose constructionist which means he would bend the rules a little bit. for example: for the right to bear arms statess that anyone has the right to own a gun. a loose constructionis would say, well no not everyone does because newborn babies should not have guns. a strict constructionist would say , yes newborn babies have the right to have a gun.  the federalist party is now the modern day republican party and the republican party is now the modern day democratic party. doesnt make  sense does it? well its the truth though many aspects of each fall into each modern day party.|`|AA11725144	sergei federov|`|0LncRRVTaa	HOCKEY.|`|s1HBBm3baa	HOCKEY.

dak2csghaa	Sounds like you need to practice the 2 handed jam. I had to accomplish this before getting the hang of the one handed stuff. Also, instead of trying to dunk off of one leg when running, try a jump stop and leap with both your legs to dunk. I always found the running one leg jump dunk to be quite difficult for me, however I am just 6'0. And yes.. at that height and allot of leg workouts with ankle weights I can jam...:) |`|vgO8E0NCaa	First answer this question  Are you trying to do a one handed or two handed dunk?    Second (If you are trying a one handed)  Can you already do a two handed dunk pretty easily?|`|a19ce2dc11bcfcbe4ad3e7108e91dab3aa	Well I can't help you on dunking a basketball, but I can help you on dunking Oreo cookies... mmm... Take an Oreo, hold it with two fingers, hold it in a glass of cold milk for about 10 seconds and then enjoy!|`|RG6YVOQdaa	6'6 and you can't dunk? dude... try dunk with 2 hands. or hold the ball iwth your wrist, push it up against your wrist. when i try to dunk i push the ball up with my left hand and if i can get it higher then rim, smash it down with my right hand.|`|2jhAVmRWaa	The best and most effective way would be to hit up the gym and work on your legs. Plenty of squats and leg presses will help with that. There is no reason why at your hight you should have to palm the ball.     Best of luck!|`|EeH97vIkaa	I guess you could two hand while running and dunk it |`|h8YukGmSaa	Ok check this out im 6"3 i can 360 with ease but i started doing tricks on a 9foot goal i think u should master the ten foot goal then try until u own it . an u sound like your very slim u need to get stronger i am 220 .. so muscle will help you
7Eb7aG6saa	1) stay low during the game (if your already low, diving is less of a hassle, and becomes more of a habit)  2) extend your arms in the direction of the ball and play the ball  3) extend your leading arm all the way out, and extend your body   4) once your entire body is extended and your hip has made contanct with the ground (same side as the side you played the ball) roll onto your back  5) get up and back in the game ;)  landing on your knees is the improper way to dive, and can result in injury. they are more for protecting your leg as you extend outwards. in order to practice this, wear long socks on your arms so you can slide on the floor easier and go through the steps one at a time without a ball. once you get the hang of it its really easy and i find it fun    good luck with it and you'll be fine ;)|`|l3Wq57gsaa	if your a girl don't dive strait on cause it will hurt your **** (especially if they are big) dive slightly on your side|`|CkhAD1Pcaa	As long as you have knee pads, there is nothing to worry about.|`|63b3e2c6e6c929c985912a3967d33880aa	just extend your body when you go down and keep you hed up!     when you go to dive dont fall to your knees fall on your body, your knee pads are not there so you can fall on your knees they  are there so that when you dive and your knees hit the floor you knee caps wont shatter.       have fun!!!!!|`|AHLA8Tmuaa	Well i had the same problem. sometimes it helps to take your kneepads off so you know that there is no support to hold you when you fall. So when you pass or bump the ball you want to land on you stomach. It helps me alot but everynow and then i use my kneepads!    Good luck|`|AU4LAtqMaa	there is nothing to worry about.  practice at home to get comfortable.  ask one of your friends to help you.  just have fun!!|`|su5FriURaa	Well hit the ball first then continue through then slide through on your stomach and knees keep your head and neck up so you dont die ={D|`|LeWnRHLmaa	okay well it is my 1st year too and i wouldnt even get the ball when it is too low becuase i get nervous to death!!!! what i did to help was went on my kitchen floor and ran and slid on my knees....it works

In addition, white bread is extremely processed and lacks vitamins - why not make this delicious and healthy?  * Multigrain adds its own flavor that complements the sweetness of the jelly and peanut butter.  * Whole wheat is healthiest option. Make sure the bread is 100% whole wheat flour, not 100% enriched whole wheat flour.      Choose your peanut butter. You'll need to decide between chunky or smooth. Chunky can often be harder to spread, as it can tear the bread. But it does add a nice crunch.    Choose your jelly. Common options include grape jelly, strawberry jelly or raspberry jelly. The adventurous might chose apple jelly.    Get a good amount of peanut butter on a knife or spoon (this amount varies with your personal preference) and spread it out evenly onto one of the slices of bread.    Wipe any residual peanut butter from the knife onto the second piece of bread.     Scoop some jelly onto the other slice of bread. Again, the amount is up to you, but when in doubt, use less rather than more. Jelly tends to squeeze out the edges and drip if you use too much. Make sure to spread the jelly evenly.

TTech is  2 because they beat some good but not great Big 12 teams leading up to Texas.  they barely beat Nebraska.  they just do beat texas, and after a texas defender drops a SURE interception, on the last play.  so they become the hunted, not the underdog hunters, which is a huge blow psychologically to a team.  also factor in that its in Norman, and, when they were down by, say 21 points or so, they go for it constantly on 4th down and fail to convert.  this was an ugly game for TTech, but they're not this bad.      remember Mizz @ Tex this year?  Mizz was destroyed, but they're not as bad as they were that game.  the big 12 champ will be a different story.  neutral site, not in norman OK or austin TX or lubbock TX.    ttech is a top 10 team, although they might fall just out of it.|`|2650fac0b438508f71a0c9795a001681aa	YES |`|EeH97vIkaa	I don't think they will drop that much|`|CorE4QEFaa	Yes, they're  2 right now playing on the road against  5....whether it's a blowout or not, they've still beaten great teams, and blown out bad ones.

Did you happen to see my sick interception earlier in the game?|`|gxDhQaCOaa	he was robbed. the refs this season are making horrible calls. they even admitted afterwards it was the wrong call|`|9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	I think he was robbed, but it didn't matter. At least the Steelers have something else to add to the NFL record book. As far as the Titans go, I can't wait until the Steelers go into Tennessee and murder them. I think the Titans are only going 13-3 this year. Jets, Steelers, and Colts.|`|EeH97vIkaa	Why does it matter it wouldn't have changed the outcome the steelers were going to win any way regardless of what happen|`|xNkmK0SHaa	In spite of your ranting and raving, I will not report you.  I understand Steeler fans. I am one.  Yes, he and the team got screwed without a kiss. In this morning's edition of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, it was reported that the officials admitted that after viewing the tape AFTER the game.  It was also reported that Mr. Rooney left his seat after an earlier poor call and talked with the league rep.      Now, I don't know a whole lot about football.  I'm not even a football fan. However, I do know that Palamolu was robbed.    As far as the a new NFL record for one point win, the officials did that.|`|8juUgSK2aa	the refs had money on the charges plus the points.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	"You'll never hear me say 'I' anything, but I lost this game," said Roethlisberger, who appeared to be crying into a towel when reporters entered the locker room.    http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game...    Yeah that sounds real Tough when your quarterback cries after games.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Yes, the officials did err in that call.  The TD should have stood.      As for the coach being concerned about the TD being allowed, did you consider that there is a playoff tiebreaker concerning points allowed in conference?  If you are so much of a football fan, that should have entered your mind.|`|fJd2J19faa	It was clearly a backward pass. They robbed him. How about that one finger interception earlier. Troy  is a boss. The New Steel Curtain is awesome. If they had better offense they would be unbeaten. I am a long time fan since the 70 `s. Jack Lambert would be proud of this unit.  I to am looking forward to the Titans game . I hope they are still unbeaten when they meet.|`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	Now, even the refs agree.|`|EbMfQ4Ibaa	Yeah, but at least the Steelers made history.  They won the game by a score of 11-10, a final score that has never happened before in over 12,500 previous NFL games.|`|6rWolcZBaa	It was clearly a forward pass on the replay... i am for the steelers but that was not a touchdown.    if it was a legal pass they would have given it to him.|`|VtHACqKeaa	Yes, I do believe he was robbed!  There was no illegal forward pass, but, like you said, the Chargers were going to lose anyways!  Plus, it's kind of cool that there had never been a 10-11 score in the NFL before.    But as for the Titans game - it's going to be great!!  But, being a native Nashvillian, I am Titans all the way!!!  10-0 BABY!

fDHOKkjdaa	The rule says, a goalie standing out of his circle can be ran into, but not hit.   The difference between accidental touch and hitting is in fact the intension. NHL punishes the intension of interfering. Since he'S no longer in his protected zone, a played can touch him harder liek he would be a player, but he cannot hit him, which would result in interferring the goaltender.    You would use brute force rather than technic to overcome him and avoid him to complete his job.     Every time you think is this legal think abotu this:   Did he used an illegal check or brute force (except for a legal check hit) rather than speed and technic to prevent the oppenent to complete his work properly? If you say yes, it is prohibited by a rule somewhere.    In this case, even tough the golie is out and considered liek a player, you can only "interfer" with him, if he blocked you the way. So, it is legal to touch a golie accidentally if it his fault. He also can receive a 2 minutes penalty for obstruction if he deliberatly blocked you teh way by interposing his whole body.    So, you arenT' allowed to hit a goaltender liek a defensemen would with you, but you can touch him or make him fall if he placed himself in your way. But, you must try to dodge him for him to be guilty.|`|N5peXoYWaa	no because their coach will kill you|`|VjAoRpIhaa	sadly no|`|X1yZOMYHaa	It's supposed to fair game, I think. Once a goalie steps outside his crease he's a regular player. That's the rule, but refs are pretty quick to call goalie interference, and teams are even quicker to jump someone who even so much as bumps their goalie.    So the unspoken rule is don't touch the goalie. Even if outside the crease it isn't an official rule.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	No.    But wouldn't it rock if you could!?|`|AA10551195	No. It has happened, though, but the player gets creamed by all of the goalie's teammates every time they catch up with him the rest of the game. It doesn't seem to be worth it. |`|7lDSkGLTaa	Nope    I Remember Vancouvers First Came Against Calgary    Roberto Got Rocked By Bertuzzi|`|5UIsGjxCaa	In the modern day NHL it cannot happen. The NHL treats the goalies like the NFL treats quarterbacks. Protect them at all costs.   If those rules were in effect in the '60's and '70's Johnny Bower might still be playing.|`|AA11725144	i think so cuz i have seen that a couple times with now calls|`|HXVFmteIaa	you can only check the goalie when he's outta the trapezoid behind the net. but the only way he's outta the trapezoid is if he doesnt have the puck because the goalie can only have the puck in the trapezoid|`|giDaG7TYaa	If he is on the boards he is able to get ran into, but not checked. You will always see goalies try to play the puck with there bodies far from the boards because the goalie must leave room for skaters to skate by.|`|aLsiHjCZaa	no. It counts as if he's in his crease. it would be goaltender interference to check him.|`|c5isiAT4aa	According to the rule book when the goalie leaves his/her crease he/she becomes a player so he/she should be able to be hit (considering they wear the most padding) but they do not enforce it this way; if a player interferes with the goalie (makes a play to hit the goalie off the puck with force) then there would be a 2 minute goalie interference penalty.  |`|ROWSzTknaa	There was three goalie interference penalties against the Maple Leafs/Habs last Saturday where the Leafs did not "check" Price but bumped him. Goalies are off limits. Unless you want to take a stupid penalty or get your *** kicked by the opposing line-up, stay away from the goalie. 
AA11725144	thats a lot of wins|`|KXGNeRFhaa	 My thoughts are....only 232 wins, really? Bob Johnson only had 231?     Still over 1000 wins away from Scotty Bowman. LOL|`|VIgSJnL1aa	my thought was oh great Gerber choked another win for ottawa
JIDTxeoHaa	Since the Lightning fired him after only 16 games, it makes you wonder if there is some power struggle going on behind the scenes. The new owners (who by the way are supposedly friends of Melrose) seem to be calling all the shots and must have disagreed with Melrose's way of doing things (unless Melrose ultimately thought he wasn't up for the challenge). The lightning still seem to think that Lecavlier and St. Louis won the cup for them and are trying to build a new team around them. They apparently forgot that players like Boyle played a big part in their championship season. Bet they wish they kept him around now. They even traded away young defenseman Carle who they recieved in exchange for him.  The Lightning don't need a new coach; they need a new GM and need to give the coach more than 16 games to turn a team back in to Stanley Cup holders.|`|UIcItboeaa	I can't believe they fired him, not because of who he is, but because theyll be stuck paying of both him and tortorella. good thinking, who are they, the Sabres front office?      PS-So glad I didnt buy the Sabres tickets avilable at work...3-0, good lord|`|AA11725144	team hasnt been doing well but i feel like it was way to soon|`|WshIrCo2aa	I think these early season coaching moves are stupid as a general rule, and especially in a sport that has such a long season.  After 16 games, how much can you really know about a hockey team, especially one that has gone through the changes Tampa has.      As long as Melrose ends up back on ESPN, I'll deal with it.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	My Opinion that the Tampa Bay Lightning Organization was a Little to Impatient its a Long Season they should've never hired him If they we're planning to fire him early in the season.      Bad Move.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Crazy. It's not his fault. He isn't on the ice. COme back to ESPN Barry!|`|C1aFhbUMaa	Don't let the door hit you on the way out.|`|XuGFt3boaa	I hate to say this, but, it's time for Melrose to head back to ESPN.  When the Lighting hired him as their head coach, I knew it wasn't going to last long.  And look what happened to 'em.  The Lighting are 5-7-4, tied for 4th in the Southeast and tied for 13th place in the Eastern Conference.  With Melrose gone, the Lighting have a big mess to clean up.|`|UADHt07Zaa	I don't get why you fire a coach 16 games into his tenure, especially after an off-season where you had so much turnover.  I get the feeling that Koules and Barrie have become the Dan Snyder tandem of the NHL.|`|DBxaU0Tjaa	I was actually a slight bit humored i don't have a opinion on it but, I went to a Lightning game last night so guess that was his last.|`|FcettwI8aa	? neva heard of him.|`|g5w9Atyhaa	Hockey is ridiculus why fire a coach so soon. ESPN will bring him back in a heart beat. He just made some quick cash.|`|AA10895316	Unless he had no control over his team, only the team knows for sure then the firing is just a knee jerk reaction to a bad start.
N1OnviExaa	Carey Price.

I really miss the old gimmick wrestlers of yesteryear when they weren't so concerned about being politically correct with stereotypes.    You know, the guys like the Honky Tonk Man, the Mountie, Big Boss Man, Hillbilly Jim, the Berzerker, guys like Ludwig von Borga who would say that their hobbies are beating up Americans.    I was really glad to see like the Undertaker stand the test of time but I miss the days where he was all ghoulish and was managed by Paul Bearrer.  The biker persona just never seemed as cool to me.      Granted there are some really talented cats in the sport now but I miss the days where there wasn't a lot of gray area between the good guys and the bad guys. |`|HdsPxM9Faa	yes big daddy nash played basket ball at tennsessee. . |`|XYOkHeqsaa	i do|`|v0HxECFnaa	I do and don't.

12QJ9QMRaa	Basically.....    Because his personality is annoying.  I HATE PTI.  I won't say he knows nothing, but muuch like Cowherd on ESPN Radio..he gets an idea based on a few facts..and then sticks with it right or wrong.  That kinda annoys me.  But that is just the PTI and not MNF.    As for MNF..well.  He doesn't have much personallity, and to be honest..when he pontificates to people who have actually PLAYED the game..I find it a bit annoying.    But honestly..while he is far from the worst they have ever had (lets face it Dennis Miller will always have that title) he just sticks in peoples craw because his lack of play time tends to make people feel he lacks credibility.  Funnily enough, half the people who bash him have never palyed the game themselves.    Anyhow...I would listen to him anyday of the week before I put up with Bryant Gumble (really..is EVERYTHING in the NFL a race issue?  If ya listened to him it was.  Whole new meaning to color commentary) or Joe Theisman (hats pronounced THEES- man no matter what his EGO says) or some of the total goobers that do the College Shows.      Honestly... the only thing I disagree with you on is the Jaworski comment.  He might not be the best personality, but he spends more time watching film than pretty much the rest of the ESPN staff combined, and as a former QB, does know his stuff.  Personally, he makes dealing with Kornheiser easier for me.|`|AA11280073	I like him. He makes me laugh. |`|iGYGJfgsaa	I like him better on PTI. He seems out of place on MNF|`|oqtb0Xm1aa	I think he's great everywhere.

He's a very good announcer in my opinion, I don't know why people rip on him. |`|EeH97vIkaa	I never really knew why people didn't like him i always thought he did a decent job|`|bqZqSj30aa	what annoys me the most is not necessarily his knowledge of the game.  Its the fact that he repeats the same thing over and over and over and over again!!!      Its like he latches on to one story or angle and beats it like a dead horse.  Like the Packers MNF game -- which was Aaron Rogers' mnf debut... he never shut up about Favre. I finally had to mute the tv. i couldn't take it anymore!|`|fHxpycJSaa	He's a celebrity butt sniffer. I think he's leaving his wife and kids for Brett Favre. Ask Ron Jaworski how much about football Kornheiser knows. Jaws acts like he wants to punch him in the face every game. Even Tirico has made snide comments about some of the stupid crap coming out of his mouth. I don't even like him on PTI anymore. He needs to go away.
e37b10dd9e41a3d4d901feab990b7e9daa	  Bradford really put up so great numbers so far tonight. He is looking good for the Heisman. Having the receiver corps that he has is great but the way the ball is exactly where it is makes it easier for the receivers to pull in those one handed catches. On the other side if he had missed it I'm sure Stoops would have been all over here about using two hands. But yes it was a fantastic pass and catch.|`|oiA6Miwvaa	That was frikin sweet dude awesome catch Sam is having  a awesome game he is going to go the nfl and be in the hall of fame|`|EeH97vIkaa	I was not really watching the game and i just turned 2 it and the catch happened i was amazed especially on a hurt arm|`|hk6opAq1aa	WOW absolutely wow|`|7RziqsDcaa	no i missed it damit.

Y6wlpWwsaa	Game should have been 17 - 10 with an extra point conversion to follow.  Sunday Night Football Game Halftime show discussed this situation.  Per league rules TD/fumble were legitimate however the score will not be changed since game is official.  Steelers Play-Off Chances could be impacted since points scored is part of the tie breaker system.  A small chance but still a chance.  As a Steeler fan I can not complain too much since Chargers have had @ least one call go against them in previous game(s) which cost them that respective game.  Referees are human & make mistakes, however with the review process the call on the field should have not have been wrongly overridden.|`|adcf97a1944883fc858cda092e352c47aa	Final score 11-10 steelers.. No  didnt get the last seconds that should of been a touchdown but they were calling all type of stuff on the steelers throughout the whole game so I figured they'd do that|`|58TDAT1zaa	11-10 Steelers win.  I love a close game and that one sure counts.|`|AA10034577	11-10.  I don't see where the illegal forward pass was.

efdf492fe9cb67c309332e436d4aadc8aa	yeah Hall was a bad fit for their system and struggled all year so far.  He was beat like 44 out of 67 throws his way.  He plays way off the receiver and just tries to vulture picks...he either gets an INT or gives up 20 yards on the reception, he's not a cover corner like the Raiders need.  And since he was opposite Asomugha, who literally takes away half the field, opponents threw his way all the time, he's responsible for keeping dozens of opposing drives alive.  Look at last week with the Panthers, they put a true cover corner opposite Asomugha, plugged the hole Hall had left, and they got 4 picks and totally contained Smith.    Hall could just sit back and try to jump routes with the Falcons who ran a zone defense, but he cant do that when he's playing man and he doesnt have a safety or a coverage LB to drop back and help break up the pass.|`|gzRZlfpLaa	hey wasnt even there best cornerback you fools. He wasnt a good cb at all, he was just fast. Asomaghi is the best corner in the league,.....read a book |`|OeFNGqbzaa	WHAT!!!!! they did. omg deangelo hall is their best player|`|pnsp765saa	Al Davis is an idiot|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	simply because they're the Raiders|`|UGAr0M3laa	cause he sucked. btw if u dont know he know plays for the redskins|`|k6u1Kka0aa	Because Al Davis is a senile, old fool.|`|UiJlbrf4aa	because the raiders coach is stupid and now they are going to suck            Edit: Suck Even More|`|nuteEejcaa	Al Davis is starting to show how much of a crazy old coot he is, first he fires the coach who did nothing wrong, i wasn't surprised when he kicked Hall of the team, i wonder what he will do next, he being Al Davis.|`|tYDVLM9raa	Al Davis is an idiot|`|jioRrEh6aa	Because I'm an idiot and I paid that guy too much money.|`|31svT54Haa	For being a bad player off the field.|`|AA11414524	It has to do with Al Davis being in charge. The man is old, senile and perhaps semi-delusional. The Raiders will not be able to be a good team again until after he is out of the picture.|`|okECVBkzaa	Wow.. Im not sure what DeAngelo Hall you all are watching, but the Raiders D Hall was actually the most beatin corner in the league. From day 1 when a rookie burned him for 9 catches for over 140 yards and a TD. Every WR he has covered had a big game.     His stats arent good. He has a couple INT's only because he's the most thrown at CB in the league. He has tackles because he's always tackling the guy who caught the ball he was covering. Because of his awful play nobody will throw to the other side at Asomugha who only has been thrown at 10 times all year. Thats once a game.    The only question that should be asked is "Why did the Raiders sign DeAngelo Hall?"|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Because the old goblin owner wants to die and leave the Raiders as bad off as he can.|`|XPoVTTDRaa	cus the raiders suck and they want to suck more.|`|bhfArCrfaa	because deangelo hall was playing like sum garbage raiders use man to man deangelo is used to zone...ohh and the raiders do suck you saw what we did to them 24-0|`|JYOZSJDLaa	Because the raiders can never do anything right until they get rid of al davis|`|ccxYTlzQaa	DeAngelo Hall has said for a while now that he didn't want to play for the Raiders anymore because they were " the worst team with the worst ownership" in the NFL. He was litterally begging to be traded or released. He was even willing to give back his bonus money in order to do so. He also said that only about 25% of the players and coaches for the Raiders actually want to be there, and some have even offered to give up bonus money just like hall. |`|JIHZb74daa	al davis didnt like his attitute.  for raiders to win good games again.  al davis gotta stop firing coaches or trade players to other teams.  like coah gruden, look at kerry collins now...he w/with a 9-0 team because focking davis traded him like he didnt wanna pay gruden|`|KJiGI60Laa	He's overrated and not worth the contract and the money given to him.|`|EeH97vIkaa	$$$

7O9aPmgJaa	LIONS ARE MAD GOOD THATS WHY!|`|NdTy3twjaa	His name is Jake Delhome ( DA SEXY CAJUN ).  He needs to play better but his team is 8-2, that's all he has to say.|`|hPqqNFuYaa	The Panthers' gameplan was obviously to run all over Detroit's weak defense.  Stewart & Williams combined for 250 rushing yards and Delhomme only threw 19 times.  Of course his 4 ints last week were awful, but this week the gameplan was to run.  I see your worries though.  After that 4 INT game I would've liked to see Delhomme light it up through the air if I were a Panthers fan.  There's reasonable concern there if the Panthers play a team that stops the run well.|`|T4YaIHuhaa	He's not a homo, you're a homo.|`|1m4svB6qaa	Lets just agree we're all homo's|`|EeH97vIkaa	We ran for 200 plus yards we didn't need to pass today and it's matt moore

6d81aef448f585c3e0e177b015381d55aa	He was the best player of the cup and I think everyone knows that.|`|AA10690200	Zidane earned the award way before the incident and he deserves the award!|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	He should be stripped of the award and banned for life. The guy is a scumbag!|`|AA10117764	I think the whole fiasco is the most disgraceful episode in the history of the world cup - FIFA, Blatter botched it. Not interested in what they, Zidane, Materazzi, media, or anyone else have to say - FIFA world cup should be abolished. For the good of the game.    (Journalists are among the lowest form of lowlifes)|`|edf9addbac501c4bacf029f75c54623daa	That's a great decision if FIFA decides to strip the Golden Ball from Zidane . FIFA should do it to make an example and send a clear and loud message to those players that think they can do dirty things and get away with it .|`|ee7e9d922fb48594a2e13a41100d57c0aa	That's a great decision if FIFA decides to strip the Golden Ball from Zidane. Zidane is a scumbag violent man who should get criminal charges against him.

Remember that the spirit of the World Cup has been Fair Play for quite a while. What Zidane did was far from Fair Play. And remember that the voting ended at half time. He could easily be stripped of the award. Plus, I think everyone knows that France probably lost b/c of what Zidane did. He would have never missed in penalties, and the guy that replaced him (Trezeguet) missed. So from hero, Zidane became the goat of the tournament.|`|7809ca379d8b1cc04f84e1712b9bb25baa	My problem with Blatter and FIFA is that they have been far from consistent. I know everyone has compared this to the Figo incident, but honestly - if Figo was given a yellow card, and no further disciplinary action was pursued, then shouldn't a red card for Zidane be enough? And to the poster who said that what he did was far from fair play - yes, and he got a red card for it. De Rossi's actions against the US were far from fair, he got a red card and a suspension. Doesn't change the fact that he gets to be a world champion.     Wait for the whole story though, because for all anyone knows what Materazzi said could have been far from FIFA's other slogan, "say no to racism."|`|1367c4801b368e486440971ba390043faa	I think that it would be outrageous to strip him off the award, he played very well and was the best in the tournament, headbutt or not.    I would bet that all of the people who think that the award should be taken from him are Italians!!|`|60d4e2652599efecdf18c3b85fadd7aaaa	Its the "Golden Ball" people.. Not man of the match.  U can't judge him only in the final match ..  See the bigger picture pls..     Yes, its craps frm Blatter..|`|79e1fe6f555bff6da5e24cb7a16f02bbaa	I am not an italian and I think Zizou should be stripped of the title.  He did not act in a professional manner.  I can't believe that only words would drive him to act so violently.  Give me a break.  By the way he was not the best player in the tournament.  Cannavaro was.  They gave it to Zidane only because he was retiring.  He made 1 goal on his own and the others were penalty kicks.  He was overrated in this tournament.  CAMPIONI DEL MONDO, ITALIA!!!|`|b4a90e71cce14b2d33a8aa5afd2395a2aa	First of all, he didn't deserve it.   Zidane woke up towards the end of the WC.  He didn't consistently give an excellent performance, while Cannavaro did.  He should have won the title.        The award should be given to the player that has shown the most outstanding soccer skills as well as sportmanship and Zidane wasn't one of them.
LvkBXhxyaa	I think Vince McMahon was being respectful of the members of the families. It could also have been to distance WWE from the taint of abuse of steroids and to show that WWE is not in favor of Domestic Violence. In addition this is an extremely disturbing tragedy for everyone concerned. Most likely all the major players in the wrestling world are in shock. Yesterday during the tribute on RAW I thought the performers let us see who they really are instead of just being entertaing characters.Their grief was touching and sincere. I cried because I know how they feel. They miss someone who was a friend, someone they respected and loved who represented achievement to them.The family, his co-workers and fans mourn his loss, the loss of his wife, and the loss of their son. As fans we may not know who he was deep down, but we can appreciate him for the contribution he made to the wrestling world. Did this heinous act erase all the good engendered from his life?|`|AA11979089	I posted something earlier, that like 50 wrestlers under the age of 45 have passed away the past 10 years.

jDi063pQaa	Yes, squats are the best thing for you right now. You need to get your strength/weight ratio up. Try to get your max squat to 1.5 times your body weight.

J'en reviens pas qu'il joue sa dernire anne.

Mme du temps o Safin tait numro un il ne gagnait pas de partout. Sur herbe il n'aurait jamais pu avoir de gros rsultats car ni assez dfenseur ni assez attaquant. Comme sur terre o les spcialistes ont toujours t au dessus de lui (Ferrero  l'poque du grand Safin, ou Coria). Par contre il semble vident qu'il aurait largement eu sa place plus longtemps dans les 5 ou dans les 3. Et qu'il aurait pu garnir sa collection  l'open d'Australie ou l'US open. Mais suivre le rythme de Federer qui fait demi minimum  tous les grands chelems depuis 5 ans, ou mme Nadal qui engrange 4 masters par an... Safin n'tait pas  ce niveau-l.
inHkJhsYaa	Definitely, it works on your hand-eye coordination, blocking skills, endurance, speed, strength, etc.  Plus, its a lot of fun as well.  If you have the opportunity go for it.

1VKn2X4Iaa	I live in Baltimore and I am not an Orioles fan. Not because I don't like the team but because, and here is my answer to your question; As long as Peter Angelos owns the team, they will never win another World Series.     The Orioles have some fantastic young talent, but good ol Pete will only invest mid level money on mid level talent that is typically past its prime. i.e. Sammy Sosa, Payton, Hernandez, Segui, etc. and the list goes on and on. The bullpen will be solid again this year. The rotation needs a lot of work.     Sorry my friend, Camden Yards is still a great place to watch a game, but Baltimore will end up suffering through another long season. Until Pete decides to convince the fans that he is committed to fielding a winning team that stands a chance in baseball's toughest division by investing in some star talent, we will just have to say what we say every season:    "There's always next year."|`|yk4S7uuraa	The Orioles need to get a new owner, thats their biggest problem.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	They're in a competitve AL EAST, Yankees, Red Sox, Rays and the Blue Jays are only getting better.

Right now when baseball is about the money and players go to whoever offers the most you have to be willing to offer the money.     Maybe if they tried to increase the money they could spend on players they could get a better chance at being a fantastic team. As for some of the players, Curt Schilling is most likely retiring, I heard Mussina is retiring but even if he wasnt the Orioles couldnt afford him. |`|ba5ed5efc0a430ba83c52b6ed0224188aa	  Don't give up hope but it will take a few years because of the great prospects they have.  Trade Heranadez for some good young pitching.  |`|ak5A435maa	sorry, but no. thats a VERY old team. Moyer's in his mid forties, he's like 45. Schilling is also late thirties or 40s.

TifXvAxUaa	1) BEST THEME SONG(Does this include past wrestlers/stables?!): I've always been a big fan of Edge's, Randy's (both Burn in my Light and Voices), CM Punk's, Batista's, Evolution's and a few others, but I would have to say, without a shadow of a doubt, Lita's theme "Lovefurypassionenergy" by Boy Hits Car is my ultimate fave theme song!!! I guess to sum it all up...  PAST: Lita's!!!  CURRENT: Edge's!!!    2) CRIPPLER CROSSFACE, ANKLE LOCK, SHARPSHOOTER: Definitely the Sharpshooter!!! The Crippler Crossface can be escaped from as easy as pushing ur weight up with ur free hand and rolling back over ur opponent (as seen mostly in 2004), however it is an amazing move and in some situations can be incredibly difficult to reverse or escape!!! The Ankle Lock...well when someone can escape it by simply loosening up your boot shoelace (haha thanks Eddie Guerrero), then Im gonna have to go with the Sharpshooter on this one!!! And the Sharpshooter is a Legendary hold anyways, hence: Survivor series 1997!!!    WWE, TNA or ROH: WWE!!! Although each promotion/business has it's own fair share of amazing and talented wrestlers and entertainers, the fact that I've been watching WWE my whole life does it all for me on this question!!!    PUSH ANY WRESTLER: (Someone said "undertaker ( i hate him!!!)", haha I dont think he understood the word "push")!!! I'd have to give this to Charlie Haas!!! He's been bringing ratings up with very entertaining gimmicks he puts on each week, so why not give him a push?!     FAVE WRESTLING MANEUVER: Hard to choose between the F-5 and the RKO!!!   F-5: "HERE COMES THE PAIN"...enough said!!!  RKO: Style, can be performed from various parts of the arena (such as a Super RKO), quickly performed, etc.     *STARRED*  Nice set of questions, seems people like random!!!|`|ILFUcXSPaa	R-truth wats up  sharpshooter  TNA  Shawn Michaels  shooting star press|`|4Q2IvBxoaa	1.)

WWE or TNA Or Roh? WWE since it has a much bigger roster, more merchandise and better storylines ect.  4.) If you can Push a wreslter who would it be? John Morrison since he is everything that the face of the WWE should be: A great look, fantastic charisma, good wrestling ability and a future with it ect.  5.)

PMSSoTqNaa	haynesworth|`|XLXncQu9aa	I would have to agree with you there.  There aren't any other players that come to mind that rank 3rd or in the top 5 in sacks and have more than 60 tackles.  The thing about James Harrison is that he is a fast outside LB.  It takes speed and fortitude to be in that position and be around the QB, and around WR's and RB's to make that many tackles.  He kind of reminds me of the way Ray Lewis used to play.  Not to mention he still creates turnovers which is essential in a LB.  He creates a threat to the QB, and is able to stop the run.  I think he may have sealed the deal with the way he has been playing.  He is one of the reasons why the Steelers are the top defense in the league. |`|gSgYDAEAaa	Albert Haynesworth|`|StuXqez7aa	Ray Lewis.  He has been better than his old self.  Did you see the 2 picks he had last game against the Texans, who had the  4 offense.    OR    Haloti Ngata.  People can talk about Albert Haynesworth all they want, but this guy has 3 interceptions this year and has been RIDICULOUS at stopping the run.|`|39de4d27076c334630a8108a6bb9b519aa	One of these guys:  Albert Haynesworth  James Harrison  Joey Porter (Do you see how many sacks this guy has??)

I don't see Detroit beating them at all.  Should be a real @ss whipping looking for a place to happen.  Atlanta will not beat them.  Green Bay under Favre, maybe a loss.  Under Rodgers I am not convinced.  At Tampa has to be a win to continue their run at the NFC South title.  I think they will not get beat the second time by those clowns.  Denver has nothing to offer them by way of competition, and the Carolina D will eat them up.  We have seen them match up real well against NY Giants before with the Giants getting held to only 3 points.  The defense this year for Carolina is even better.  I say that will be a bad night for the Giants. Definitely a win over New Orleans that is in the hunt for how to win regularly.  I may be wrong here but who knows maybe they go out and crush everyone they go against because of their killer defense.|`|wkUMmqunaa	vs Detroit - WIN  @ Atlanta - LOSS  @ Green Bay - WIN  vs Tampa Bay - WIN  vs Denver - WIN  vs New York Giants - LOSS  @ New Orleans - WIN    Final record: 12-4|`|8fXlBdtdaa	vs Detroit - WIN  @ Atlanta - LOSS  @ Green Bay - LOSS  vs Tampa Bay - WIN  vs Denver - WIN  vs New York Giants - LOSS  @ New Orleans - WIN    Final record: 11-5|`|kQ6hhXDXaa	it's either going to be 12-4 or 10-6. they'll beat detroit handily. they have to beat atlanta for the division title. They might beat the packers. it will depend how well the secondary plays that game. they also need to beat tampa bay for the division title, but i think the panthers lost to them earlier this season, so anything goes. they should beat denver. deangelo williams and jonathan stewart should be able run all over the porous denver defense. they will lose to the giants. giants dline is too good and their secondary isn't that bad. they'll beat the saints. saints defense is pretty bad. if i had to pick a record, i would say 12-4 because i think they'll beat tampa bay. they'll have loses at green bay, giants. |`|DW7sVLE2aa	I'm a huge Panther fan but I cant forsee a victory against NYG  But still I dont think we will lose to the Packers  I say we lose against Tampa and NYG  12-4

DvBPLP4saa	Because empty net situations are a lot like penalty kills. (The other team has an extra attacker) and AO is a pretty decent penalty killer.|`|VC5mEULTaa	Why not? To be a great player in the league, you need to be great on offence as well as defence.|`|kFaJxEhPaa	Well, he has to maintain with Crosby and Malkin, somehow after missing a few games.|`|Hki3AoL5aa	because the other team has their best players out there too, why cant he be, he can battle on the boards and get the pukc out and score on it if he needs to like he did tonight|`|tW8fh4IGaa	Because he's a great player, hands down. When a team has their goalie pulled they have an extra attacker and having Ovie makes it tougher for them to score against. Plus he's more likely to score on the empty net and give them some breathing room.|`|KyCJOR2paa	Because he is fast and tenacious.  He is a good defensive player.  If I was the Capitals, I wouldn't want anyone else out there.|`|AA11725144	pad the stats!!|`|fQPzqdNraa	Because he has become more defensively more responsible and he is one of the most offensively dangerous players in the NHL.|`|c5isiAT4aa	because he is the best scorer in the game right now.  if you were a coach would you put him on when the net was empty?  i know i would.|`|7ElYvq98aa	needs to catch up on sum points!

We seem to be playing ok but we aren't doing that good. Hopefully things will turn around. But i'm still staying loyal to them.  I make myself feel better knowing were not as bad as the islanders    |`|LwEQVKRwaa	The Flyers. I thought they would have been in at least the 7-8th spot, after last season. Lots o' hockey 2 go.|`|iCKcU6luaa	They actaully talked about this on TH (Thats Hockey) on TSN.      I have to agree that Ottawa is The biggest dissapointment, you all know what they did last year, now they are below a playoff spot.      The sens have been having meetings about there latest non-sucesss. so the sens get my vote|`|XRt8na34aa	Lightning, they suck and got Melrose fired. |`|c4FdQODOaa	I thought the Lightning would be a lot better this season than they have been. Maybe a new coach will get a good feel for the team and lead them in a good direction.
EeH97vIkaa	I agree with you i am a huge panther fan and hope we can make it all the way and be known as a powerhouse team again|`|6TYXWU9saa	I would like to say the Giants again, since I grew up in NY and have been a Giants Fan since I was a kid. But I don't want to jinx them at all. Just a side note: I was beyond happy when my Giants beat those cheating Scum Bags The Pat's. They can't cheat anymore they lose, they lose Brady, they lose more, isn't karma great !!!|`|khGS79Leaa	Afc champ Titans vs. Colts  Nfc champ Giants vs. Cardinals    Superbowl Titans vs. Giants    Winner Giants|`|FCrRso6raa	Titans wont even reach the super bowl because there schedule is way too easy, they will get eliminated in the first round. I say the jets rather than the titans. The Giants will win the Panthers.|`|AA10456571	Panthers will lose in their first playoff game.    Titans vs. Giants|`|EY1KHLxBaa	Giants vs. Titans.  I hate that I just said that.
EYPrtlwJaa	I didn't watch that game tonight. But I have noticed that the refs seem to favor the Celtics. I thought we got rid of the problem with the refs and them fixing the games and calls..... Hmmm....|`|EeH97vIkaa	Did u see that finish that's nba at its best|`|KbbkaGTuaa	The touch fouls were absurd.  Joe Johnson hits the 92nd point of the game gets hit by 2 Celtics defenders.  2 plays later Pierce drives left  to the hoop......Joe plays the ball and they call foul |`|BIyJUmM9aa	yeah, I kinda saw that..............|`|JsVZQkWyaa	yea it was bs and the last second shot was luck and joe johnson got fouled they didnt call it but whe pierce did they called it. boston celtics where bs happens|`|YVr6JJNBaa	of course. David Stern loves him some Boston Celtics    |`|l03yE9sFaa	i know|`|0eMQDINbaa	I heard there were calls like that on Monday against the Raptors too.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say no.|`|AUjTaLvwaa	dallas plays sf and seattle the next two weeks so we'll be at 8-4. then we play bal, pit, ny, phi. i think we could pull 2, maybe 3 wins out of that.|`|p0Nf1ct3aa	No... seahawks had way too many injuries |`|Nc637a6laa	Of Course I Know My Team Will Make the Playoffs They are America's Team    THE DALLAS COWBOYS|`|qov5T21Daa	Im a Niner fan so Im not worried if we are going to make the playoffs. I just hope we can upset the hopes of the Cowdungs. WooooHoooo we kicked @$$ today over the Rams....hey its a big victory for us....so let us niners enjoy this win, even if it is meaningless to the rest of you.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Dallas is on shaky ground I mean this win was sweet but you can't count out the Niners andSeahawks those are what you call trap games so until we are -84 or 9-4 i am holding out on any predictions for my team.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	I think the Steelers will make it...    the rest, I really don't care about.|`|Z8hGA5Tgaa	I don't know if the Chargers can play defense like they did a Pitt then maybe we can win out I mean the Broncos beat the Falcons why not us. The Colts always lose to us even when we try and give them the game like the time Vinny missed the FG or in the playoffs. Then we take care of business at Tampa, KC, Oakland and Denver not that tough but one more loss will hurt and probably eliminate us.|`|kDmVKyQGaa	I think my Giants are going to win it all!|`|sY7g3ttPaa	WE SURE CAN!  My slug-racing team hasn't lost a game sense the winter of '94!|`|5VKBBsA0aa	Yes, I know the Cowboys can make the playoffs. I wouldn't count the Ravens out just yet. They do have a tough schedule but they are a solid team. I actually like how they match up against the Skins and Steelers. We will see how it all plays out. I certainly want to start looking at the match ups in the last six weeks and see who plays who. |`|dKwTyhIAaa	titans all the way to the superbowl. got the tenth win today! |`|V6gpvM5Gaa	redskins got it|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	I have My fingers crossed. LET THE FLUKE CONTINUE!!!|`|kWULp7teaa	Colts are going to win the SuperBowl this year!|`|2U115vYMaa	i love my birde i bleed green, but with that tie today i dont think that they have any chance|`|rRAYbIRjaa	I'm a Bears fan...although we got whooped today, I believe the Bears have a good chance simply because of a relatively weak NFC North.|`|AA11523885	Packers - after today they showed they definately CAN... but whether or not they will is the question.|`|oFNUnM9Paa	I AM A RAIDER FAN! I LIVE AND DIE BY THEM NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS GO!|`|dmbEEeexaa	Yea my team is the Jets in there gonna do more then just a playoffs how bout a Super bowl|`|iEj6EXbMaa	I think the world would end before my Kansas City Chiefs make the playoffs this season      I would say we are having a "rebuilding season" but at this point, im sick of saying that too|`|1oJbGtbgaa	STEELERS ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPERBOWL!!!  I think it will be the steelers and the giants in the bowl this year...steelers should have beaten the giants they were ahead the whole damn game, but whatever i think that the giants are over-rated, along with the titans who play sh*t teams like the jags...panthers are ok but not the best...and the only reason Pittsburgh lost the 3 games they did is because of Big Ben sucking this year because of injuries even though he managed to barely pull off a win against San Diego...defense is what saves Pittsburgh and we  1 in the NFL for defense to prove it!!|`|xJNxXPbZaa	YEHA   THE COWBOYS WILL MAKE THE PLAYOFFS  |`|fqr1y3cAaa	Truth be told, it completely depends on our game with Miami.  History has it that the Patriots always struggle with Miami which is why I hate them.    Without Adalus Thomas keeping the defense together, I honestly think the Patriots will just miss the playoffs.|`|7RziqsDcaa	No, my crappy Bears have no chance now. They need to rebuild.    I like the Falcons and Titans chances, though, lol.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	don't count the chargers out yet they just barely lose every game.  if there luck turns around they can win those easily.    and of course im rooting for the pats to win it all.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Oh most definitely. The Buccaneers will be going to the playoffs.|`|JTSNljLhaa	yes but we shouldv beaten the Jets  i hope the chargers dont make it

If the Jets still can't beat the Patriots, then the trade was pointless for them to make, and that means the Packers got the better of the deal.    Dolphins were unaffected, Chad Pennington was most likely going to be cut whether the Jets got a new quarterback or not, the only benefit the Dolphins got was a little extra time for Pennington to work with them since the Jets cut him earlier than they had planned to.|`|BpeGhqnGaa	packers..they now have a young, decent quarterback who could possibly grow to be another brett favre|`|a20a9b36d311f1bf1a35473449dd65adaa	Farve, sorry but he's the man.|`|RjjJMMRYaa	Jets|`|YCwmCDkUaa	For the moment...Jets    Then Dolphins    Then the Packers    In the end (a couple years from now) it will be...Packers, Dolphins, Jets|`|5RhGnjZMaa	Jets |`|HuslEw7daa	the NFL|`|EeH97vIkaa	Dolphins they had no QB before that trade and they would be really bad without him but the whole team stepped up this year|`|blzTwWnJaa	1. Dolphins 2. Jets 3. Packers    The Dolphins got a solid qb in pennington and that is what changed them into a contender.     The Jets greatly improved with Favre, but Pennington would have done fine.     The Packers improved with Rodgers but their record isn't what it should be.    Great Question    I ranked these on how their records would be.    without the trade, the dolphins would be either 3-6 or 2-7, the jets would be either 5-4, 4-5, or 3-6, the packers would be 5-4, 6-3|`|7AFwvJzbaa	I have to say the packers. It looks like they are going to get a good draft pick back from the Jets and Aaron Rodgers has played great this year with a bad shoulder. The reason the packers dont have a great record is because of there run defense and offensive line.

AA12243350	ammo prices have been sky high for a while now. Between the wars, and China buying up lead, brass, copper etc and add in the huge demand for ammo right now by panicked gun owners, and prices are far from fair. are those prices comparible to others? yes.  Find the cheapest surplus ammo you can for plinking, FMJ is fine. But do not try to hunt with full metal jacketed ammo. it is not intended for that and only wounds an animal leaving it to suffer. Use soft point ammo for hunting. Which brand you choose, should be dictated by cost and intended use.  shoot safe|`|YrxLbfiIaa	I see the price gouging has started......    Those prices are double what others were paying a few weeks ago......    Buy here before its gone --- This is good stuff......    http://www.samcoglobal.com/Ammunition.ht...|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Go with the Wolf. It's only about .25$ higher per 20 rd box than I am seeing around here. Anything less than $6 a box is good right now. I am hoping prices might come down a little in a few months (or not). I always buy the cheapest ammo I can get. As long as you clean your rifle after shooting, you won't ever have any problems.     I purchased my SKS back in '89 and have fired every kind of crap ammo I could get my hands on. It's clean and rust free. Heck, it looks practically new. No worries. Enjoy your rifle.|`|bqmLWTfYaa	go to aimsurplus.com     just FYI i bought5 1000rds of 7.62x39 a week before the election for $179 at Academy|`|PWvS7vqPaa	That is WAY too high for 7.62x39 ammunition.  You should be paying about $190-200 per 1000 rounds including shipping if you buy it online.  Anything over that is just price gouging and a ripoff.    I should say though that it is not all "Dishonesty" on the vender's part.  Many people are just panicking over Obama's recent election and are just acting irrationally.    Russian and eastern bloc weapons such as the AK and SKS can handle cheaper ammo reliably unlike AR-15's.  Wolf, Wolf Military Classic, Seller and Bellot, Golden Tiger, and Brown Bear all work very nicely in them and are relatively cheap.    Also, go to the link below and check out some of the sales from private dealers.

YrxLbfiIaa	At the gun-shop you need an ID and fill out some paperwork --- That's it -- No special permits or anything.......... I see the kids are out of school and are thumbing down the hunters.... Pay no mind to the high volumes of thumbs downs.... Most people here got it right........|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	All the paperwork you'll need is the federal form at the gunshop. It takes about thirty seconds to fill it out.|`|nLPyHkqKaa	shouldn't need any paperwork to buy a rifle.  Just have to pass a state background check.  In kansas they run your name at the gun store.  In missouri you have to go to the sheriff's department and have them pull a copy of your record.  Call the gun store, they will tell you.|`|42qWUbVZaa	You can buy from a private seller with no paperwork.  If you buy from a dealer, you will need your driver's license (or other photo ID).  You fill out a form stating you aren't crazy, a convicted felon, on drugs, etc., then they call in a background check.  It takes from 5 minutes to an hour, most often, then you pay for the gun and take it home.  The regulations are not different in FL for a semi auto rifle than for a pistol or bolt action rifle.|`|mX6aJSSYaa	Well it depends on where you are going to take it.    At your house you never need any type of paper work.    Outside of your house you will need some type of hunters certificate, noting you took some type of rifle course. 
LjR1vbl8aa	I kind of used to hate him. Being a swimmer myself and being in a lot of meets he's been in like the Grand Prix and Trials and stuff... but then I read this interview about how he doesn't care as much about winning, just that he can try and help make swimming a bigger deal in the United States. I thought that that was really cool and from then on I've cheered him on a lot more then I used to.|`|AA11968773	Nope I'm not surprised at all since he's been in the Olympics before and is one of the best swimmers in the world.|`|ewyAvP8haa	dude... i dont care about olymics|`|M4k3935jaa	Whats ur question? And also michael phelps has more things to make him a bigger cheater. i.e.- he has a larger heart, larger upperbody, He wuz born with giant feet, and he wuz born with a thing so he never gets tired.  I hope he doesnt beat mark spitz record|`|39514UKPaa	He is truly amazing!    Well, he is huge, so yeah. Height helps with swimming.    I hope he does well too. I have met him and he is really nice.|`|Dx8RYTYjaa	Michal Phelps won a gold in every event he swam in last Olympics... there is a good chance he'll win again. He certainly is an amazing swimmer. Some people believe hes on his way to becoming the next Michael Jordan since everyone knows his name... doesn't matter who they are or what they so they all know he's a swimmer and a great one at that.|`|QpPzXqIVaa	well he's the fastest swimmer in the world.  so yeah i can believe it.|`|9cboqdGUaa	Of course Michael Phelps is in "da" Olympics.  What kind of question is that?|`|y51J8ySdaa	that is a total waist of points
AA11895041	Most batboys, if not all, are the sons of the coaches or executives.|`|fd4a81393d60954c429dae5247a34f7eaa	interesting question...but i don't know|`|AA10139506	You must be a boy.  Past that, IDK.|`|GdXB6qouaa	you have to have friends in the right places.
hknqb6pCaa	Start Hines Ward this week at home vs. San Diego.  Kansas City gave the Chargers all they could handle in week 10, and the Steelers are a far superior passing team than KC.      And hey, you get a thumbs up for using the word CUNUNDRUM!  You just dont get to see that word as much as you should!      Good luck this week.|`|EeH97vIkaa	Hines Ward|`|1mWmbdmkaa	hines ward...san diego's secondary is a joke|`|cdQryr7paa	I know everyone is telling you Ward, and he is a good WR.  But DeSean Jackson is up against Cincinnati.  Look for him to have a great game.  I think Jackson has a better chance of putting up better stats against the Bengals than Ward does against the Chargers.  |`|ONzPwRKLaa	Hines Ward    Good Luck, and nice WR's
EeH97vIkaa	No i hate them     Go PANTHERS!!!!!|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Nah.  I don't hate them, though.    Gruden has done well lately.  I like his "F-bombs".  He is very entertaining. |`|rNUyV1EYaa	Cowboys fan.    I don't like the Bucs, but I don't hate them, either.    I'm still trying to figure out how Dallas beat them with Brad Johnson at quarterback.|`|dXblgZEzaa	No, I dislike them.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	Sure why not? But Giants are the best :]|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Favorite team.|`|IYm9a3SUaa	(Sarcasticly) Yea they're great. A 3 point win in OT over the chiefs when the chiefs didn't get a possesion with the ball. A loss to the struggling cowboys. They haven't looked that good.|`|Xgy4Pv7raa	NO I LIKE THE REDSKINS     WHAT SON !   |`|sBMUXcAAaa	Nope|`|e85fe4bdb9a336b03f84f561231135f2aa	HELL YEA GO BUCS!!!!!|`|jU5xvjEaaa	YEAAAAAA YOU KNOW IT WOOOOO HOOOO SUPERRRR BOWWWWLLLL CHAMMMPPPPPSSSSSSS|`|h9iUEhvNaa	No, I can't stand them. But the Bucs are my dad's favorite team, so I'm stuck watching them. XD    Go Pats!|`|tze2kQrjaa	yes they are a great team |`|bhfArCrfaa	HELL NO IM A FALCONS FAN THE BUCZ SUCK ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE MOVE TO  2 IN THA DIVISION|`|CgKagbOtaa	yes. your dumb if you dont.   they are the best.  WE GOIN ALL THE WAY THIS YEAR BABY!|`|ilklAOVzaa	no...|`|r1aRL2UZaa	the only reason to like the buccaneers is cause they have a pirate ship in there stadium, but im a ny GIANT|`|d36aPyD0aa	I don't mind them..i love them for beating the Raiders in the Superbowl though.    GO CHIEFS |`|AA11005646	i used to live in Tampa and didn't like them then. I don't like em now either. Go Lions  lol|`|tLxqdON8aa	Yeah, i guess i do. I like them cause of Garcia, he was great for the Eagles (im an Eagles fan) and he is really talented. So yeah but only because they have Garcia|`|vPnNaWQyaa	There ok, i love the Tampa logo it's awesome! 
rNUyV1EYaa	Aside from that Monday night game when they beat the Giants, they have had a season to forget. They probably should have switched to Brady Quinn much sooner.|`|TCehI17kaa	They have had a real rough season thus far that's for sure.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	They are having it rough this year...only thing they did well was beat the Giants on MNF...    Good choice in teams...I'm a big Steeler fan too...|`|8bjYK21uaa	bad season especially with the qb. definitely not the worst tho. the lions hold that title.|`|KJiGI60Laa	Yeah they are good; good at not winning, and terrible at being good.|`|AA10338668	WE ARE GOOD. In my eyes :)  We will beat the Bills Monday, though :P  What makes us good?  We have a spectacular specials team, and a large fan base to love them. Sure, our defense gives off as many points as our offense scores, but we always try to give 110 percent, and sometimes that's not enough.  AND we beat the NY Giants :)|`|zvQHq9bNaa	no. theyre just about the worst team ever. wow they disgust me. thanks for letting me vent|`|JC1arh2faa	they are pretty good|`|EeH97vIkaa	They are decent |`|LJN5BMKuaa	I think they are not as bad as 3-6 rating would lead you to believe. they've played some good teams, played alot of close games, i for one they make it 2 monday night wins and beat the bills this week.
EeH97vIkaa	around 10-15-20 bucks|`|VjAoRpIhaa	you could use the metro, it comes pretty close to the stadium, but you should leave pretty early because it gets really crowded within like, maybe 30-60 minutes before the game|`|58TDAT1zaa	You shouldn't pay more than $20 for parking.  How early you want to get there depends on your goals.  If you want to tailgate then by all means go early, and enjoy the energy of the place before the game begins.  My landlord has season tickets, and rarely misses a game adn they enjoy going out to the stadium about 3 hours before the game starts normally.    Enjoy the showcase of talent you will see on Sunday as they prepare for the Superbowl this season.
93477748ce3f0258a649d546d0692e2eaa	Hockey, period.  If you play hard, you can be exhausted in under 10 seconds.  Play is continuous for minutes at a time, and the puck can go long distances and change directions quickly. In basketball your at a slow jog, the ball goes out of bounds every 30 seconds and a foul is called every 8 seconds.  This question is a joke, you have obviously never attempted to play hockey, or ice skate.  There are few sports that are less challenging or require less athleticism than basketball.  The skill sets are much different also, It takes at least 10 years of practice to excel at skating, puck handling, and shooting, then doing them all at once.  Basketball, dribble, job, throw.  If your really tall, and have some coaching, your halfway to the NBA.|`|9zdodKwCaa	Defiantly Hockey because hockey is constantly moving and is an up and down sport. Each player is somehow involved in the game. Whereas in basketball, players sit on the bench for minutes at a time without moving. Plus skating is much harder than running. |`|WnQ3fhVhaa	Well the answer is hockey. It because you have to do a number of skills well in order to participate. Skate . Have balance, speed, Stamina, hand eye coordination, fast reflexes, Strength, All in order to play at any level|`|9i4Rxqknaa	Hockey. Sure the players are out there for a shorter amount of time, but when they're out they are going hard and never stop moving. Skating takes a lot out of a person, and doing that while getting pounded by other players and taking out other players is exhausting.     And soccer players are out on a larger playing surface than basketball players are for just as long or longer.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	hockey because its harder to skate and all that|`|AA12167030	I think it's apples to oranges here. Basketball players do indeed play longer; they probably have more endurance for long-term play. Hockey players, however, do what amounts to continuous sprints in short bursts all game long. Both are Canadian games; isn't there room for mutual respect among athletes and countrymen?    By the way, I think basketball is deadly boring to watch. I don't mind playing, but give me a hockey game on the old tube any day over NBA stuff. Too slow.|`|N1OnviExaa	Basketball players are on the court longer because they play at a lot slower pace. In hockey you're busting your a$$ on skates to get from one end of the ice to the other as quick as you can. Try it, it tires you out in minutes.|`|8t5vPDnqaa	Actually it's kind of a tricky question.  I think hockey requires more athleticism to play.  The conditioning for hockey players in amazing.  Heck, on my HIGH SCHOOL hockey team, everyone had to run a 5:30 metric mile.  When playing basketball, there are times when you just stand around, but on the ice, you cannot stop moving.     However, I think at the top end of the scale, the most athletic basketball players are more athletic than hockey players.  Someone like Michael Jordan in his prime is more athletic than hockey players.  However basketball also has some real fat players who's only skill is being big.  Hockey's fat players are better conditioned than basketball's fat players.    So I think you need to be more athletic to play hockey, because you have to go all-out every time you step on the ice.|`|UIcItboeaa	Id say hockey, yes, the shift are probably longer in basketball, but its like football: half that time you could very well be standing around waiting for someone to pass to you, which obviously is part of hockey but has to happen faster. And youre totally right about the blade business|`|AA11725144	id say hockey|`|WshIrCo2aa	It's hockey, for a very simple reason.  Put hockey players on a basketball court, they could manage to play the game at some level.  Put basketball players on a ice rink, there would be a bunch of tall guys sliding around on their backsides.|`|ntfaXs9zaa	hockey you have to keep balance and be able to skate good|`|LwEQVKRwaa	Hockey....hands down.  What other sports are there that require you to play on blades, and not the flat of your feet. Basketball players also never have to play on odd man situations such as a 5-4 or 5-3. What happens in basketball, when there is a foul? Everyone gets to rest while one person shoots the ball. In hockey, you have to keep playing....even harder.     Other than football, I think it is probably the second most contact sport. Could you imagine somene like Allen Iverson getting his face smashed into the boards all night long...Don't see it happening,    People think hockey is boring, to me, I think pound for pound, it has the most action, excitement, and drama of all sports

AA11725144	i played through college here is what i would advise...    1st of all start running and dont ever stop    kick yourself in the *** if you miss one day.    start lifting... dont let people push you off the ball ever    lastly    the high school level and the college level are two VERY DIFFERENT THINGS    see if there is a small d2 d3 or junior college near by that will let you practice with them.  you will see your appreciation and eye for the game sky rocket after even practicing at the college level    starting high school soccer playing against the sisters of the poor high means nothing. reach beyond the high school level and truly learn the game and a higher level of play.    you could possibly check into practice with a d1 school but the coach would probably direct you to the club team which would be an awesome option also. focus on what you need to do|`|zp9yieKraa	run alot  train with older guys  get a kick medic and   practice alot|`|3tKwnjNKaa	lol.keep training.|`|hqG2qDh0aa	in this country you will never be good. usa sucks at soccer and thats true. |`|0rgr5CbVaa	Brazil, England, Argentina, and Italy

Good guy comes out,the crowd cheers  Bad guy comes out,the crowd boos.  Thats the extent of the RAW,ECW,SMACKDOWN fans' , passion in regards to the show  TNA folks git INTO it  Madd props to NewJack,Sandman,Tommy Dreamer,RVD,Sabu,bWo,Roadkill,DudleyBoys... and everyone i might have forgot to mention...just because i i didnt mention you,dont think the memories you etched into my brain's hard drive have faded cuz they didnt,and probably wont....  ThankYou guys....|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The "old" went out when talent was getting legit injuries due to the style Heyman had initially stressed once he got full control of the product. Some fans point to the company getting the national cable-TV program as the turning point, but the changes had already begun to keep the contract workers healthy and performing.    When you say "originals," Heyman had deals with WCW and WWE to "share" talent (almost like a Class AAA affiliate) and a number of ECW regulars left because of what I had cited; they wanted to lesson chance of injury and earn more cash.    Don't look at it as a brand name, rather see it as a name of a show. The company needed to find an outlet for talent to work....I think it's clear now that the show is a means to keep people working during their contracts and not be sitting at home - drawing paychecks - while waiting for a call to pick up mid-card dates on tours.|`|hVqGuOOPaa	It got old so they got a new one.....|`|6FjDhPnjaa	WWE Bought ECW.

I think the WWe brought ECW back to gt more young superstars or train them so when they get more popular with the fans they go to raw or smack down. or the WWe needed some thing to fill up the big gap between monday and friday.|`|GLZWFWKOaa	ECW couldn't compete with the WWF/WWE ratings, weren't bringing in enough revenue and a lot of their superstars were jumping ship.    WWE pumped money into ECW, eventually buying it and it's superstars out.  Now it has become a regular WWE show, losing the whole idea of extreme matches and has lost the superstars that made a name for the brand.    A lot of the old superstars didn't want to be a part of that and a lot of fans have been lost.  All about money and ratings in the end.

AA12380065	If the ball is kicked and goes past the line of scrimmage, then no.  If it is kicked and blocked before the ball passes the line of scrimmage and the kicking team recovers the ball, then they can try to kick a field goal again. This happened in a Pittsburgh/Cleveland game a few years back. There was talk of the NFL changing the rules so they couldn't re kick, but I am not aware if they did.|`|AA11766905	if the kicker actually makes contact w/ the ball, no. but if the snap is fumbled, or if it is a fake, then yes|`|abeb2b81d27c7c04a024b601a328fbb2aa	Bennett is correct, if the ball does not cross the line of scrimmage.|`|6493275b78fb39cfbf3028a639777ac2aa	no|`|71993b5bc2dd5ba8b08bf95b38ca53b6aa	no|`|74cd39683ed52c8604716c88c5bfc309aa	Not if the ball is kicked|`|51081d93006cb178f86a83f5a27fd8c4aa	no, if they miss the FG the possession goes to the other team|`|c1003073b8dcb7708c652c6f8a4e1ff7aa	Yeah, but why would they want to do that? It makes no sense unless the clock is running out.|`|afc42810bdc979b4a7c9b7585fd1d78caa	Lol dont listen to anyone who says yes. The only situation they would get another chance is the following ........... alot of times when the weather is bad at a game teams may be in a situation where they NEED a field goal in a situation. Since the weather is bad ( rain snow ect.) the snap and hold may get messed up so they attempt the fieldgoal on 3rd down instead of 4th down ... if you attempt the fieldgoal on 3rd down and the snap/hold is messed up and the kicker dosn't kick the ball then the team may pass or run the ball ( one of the reasons that the holder is usually a backup QB ) ... if you dont get a first down they you may have another attempt to kick the ball. if the snap/hold is messed up in that situation then your team is screwed unless they get the first down by passing/running the ball.|`|6658cfecfeb59d287b7b014a53f3e037aa	Your a dumb a** if you didnt already know that answer...grow a brain

UoT86gbiaa	No to both.  First off, Colston hasn't been that bad.  He's still getting catches, and he does have a TD.  Unless you're in a league with less than 8 teams, there's no way there's a WR on waivers that's going to outdo Colston over the next 14 weeks.    Brees has been great for three seasons.  Bench him, because he's more likely to rebound later than to flop and never recover.

Also the Buffalo Sabres will make it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Sabres will take on the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, moving on to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the semi- finals, and thus heading to the Eastern Finals only to beat the Philadelphia Flyers in a game 7 overtime win. The Sabres will then take on the 1996-1997 Stanley Cup Champions, the Dallas Stars as Jason Pominville scores the last goal at 15:36 in the 3rd period, as Buffalo wins the game 4-2. |`|EeH97vIkaa	panthers and colts i think the colts rebound|`|02VjPegsaa	im with battle b    Arizona Cardinals vs Clevland Browns   and we win

mTGEeCHaaa	Hendrick engine problems caused by bad parts: Hendrick Motorsports officials say a bad batch of parts led to engine failures by #88-Dale Earnhardt Jr. and #5-Mark Martin in Sunday's Sprint Cup race at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, CA. "Both cars had valve train failures that were related to a specific batch of parts from a vendor," said Doug Duchardt, HMS' vice president of development. Duchardt said the parts were not restricted to use by Earnhardt and Martin, whose cars are prepared out of the same building. He said they also were used by Hendrick drivers #24-Jeff Gordon and #48-Jimmie Johnson, as well as lease programs such as Stewart-Haas Racing. Earnhardt finished 39th and Martin 40th after both lost their engines within 25 laps of each other. Gordon finished second and Johnson was ninth, combining to lead 138 of 250 laps. #14-Tony Stewart was eighth and led three laps. "So we're glad it wasn't more widespread," Duchardt said.(ESPN)(2-24-2009)|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Great explanation fluffy..<br>  But it's not unusual to get a batch of defective valve springs..<br>  They catch these problems during testing most of the time..<br>  Sounds like someone opened a brand new case..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	the valves were machined improperly and the spring retainers unseated themselves and a valve dropped.

Roger winning the French would be great to see he really needs to get a full set of slam trophies to complete his collection.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	That's a really hard question for me to answer because the FedEx will *not* win, so... :-P    And I don't know about him wanting it more than Rafa...the guy is determined to make a Career Grand Slam this year (and considering it'll will only happen if he wins the Australian Open *and* the US Open (meaning the "expendable" ones per se are Roland Garros - which I expect to be Rafa's pretty much until he decides to retire - and Wimbledon - which we all know he can win), it has a lot of potential to be an actual Golden Grand Slam! :-)    VAMOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9447ea59c0351320e67d694a57a85105aa	French Open.... I think it depends on the situation on sunday....

He will win Sunday... ;)|`|AA12149254	argh, too many rafa fans answering this question! Well anyways, I enjoy your optimism and confidence in Fed but it's not like he's a guarenteed winner. There are tons of factors to be considered, if roger can maintain his mental edge and strike hard or if the weather produces intense heat. From there it would be a battle of stamina, however in terms of who can last the longest in such intense conditions i would award to nadal.  Although fed has the confidence, the motivation and the greater experience on hardcourts, BUT then the courts have also been slowed down, more to Nadal's liking. So, I see Fed taking it in 5 tight sets. And if he so happen manages to win, like the previous answer, he would instead call Borg    Fed: "Roger: 14, Borg: 11, WHO DA MAN.   And a half hour of that.|`|zN0orpp3aa	He won't have to worry about that because he's not going to win on Sunday. Nadal in 5. And as far as the French Open goes, he'll probably make the final(although that is no lock), but if he even came close in any set against Nadal, i'd be stunned. Remember, last year's final was 6-1 6-3 6-0 for Nadal.|`|F0sQ18MKaa	The French Open?? No. I dont think Federer can beat Nadal in that.

q8dX0MsNaa	every single way...???  add all your answers together. you won't get every single way.    be right back.      here's a few. l copied from one of my previous answers. and this is only worms.    the most popular rig is "texas style" where you slide a worm weight up the line, tie on a worm hook and put on your plastic worm usually burying the point of the hook back into the worm making the rig weedless.    also popular is the "carolina" rig which usually uses a heavier weight and a leader from a swivel to the hook anywhere from 2 to 6 feet long, usually 24".    then there is the "dropshot" rig where you tie the hook on with a palomar knot leaving about a 24" tag end which you run back thru the hook eye to keep the point riding up. the weight is then attached to the very end of the line. either a swivel sinker or a special dropshot sinker. l personally tie an overhand knot at the end and put on enough split shot to give me casting weight.     there is what is called "wacky" style where you hook the worm in the middle or somewhere else other than the head and fish it either with or without a weight.    "shaking" involves the use of a special flat jig head where you cast out and jiggle the rod tip and nothing else. jiggle, jiggle, rest, jiggle, rest, reel in a few inches and start again. you can do it with any of the previous rigs. just stand there for 10 minutes jiggling that rod tip. if you have to wait longer than that, go somewhere else.    these are the main ways of rigging soft plastic baits. just get the correct size worm hooks to match the size plastic you are using.|`|xtdeTwYmaa	http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/fis... or go on you tube and type in your question|`|lECmz3SEaa	Dont know much, but I will try. Use a carolina or texas rig. You basically hook the worm throught the hook and imitate a worm or fish.|`|zcrJzVauaa	There are several, Texas rig is good, Carolina rig is good, you can Wacky Style rig where you just run the hook through the middle of the worm, Finesse rig is great for clear water, and right mow the shakey head rig is the big thing on the circuit right now. Check these out, there are endless images and techniques on the internet, just type in the rig.....i would try and explain each one........but we might invent a new one through poor communication, lol.|`|ICGQ9EBcaa	Beside the Carolina and Texas rig I found a new rig in a copy of Bassmaster last year called the Bungie rig. Take a crappie jig head about 1/32oz and and with wire snips clip the eye and part of the hook leaving 1/8in of hook shank. I use a Zoom Trick worm cut 1/4in off front of worm then put superglue on jig head and stick in front of worm. then tie on a offset worm hook, i use a 3/0 size and thread through center of worm. this is a awesome rig that falls slow and when sitting on the bottom the tail floats and curls over, very natural.|`|TGm36rBWaa	This is really an open ended question isn't it?    Lets list most of the plastics out there.    Lizard - rigged texas w/bullet sinker or weightless on an off set hook    Finesse Worm -or weightless on an off set hook    French Fry - rigged texas w/bullet sinker or weightless on an off set hook    Tube  with a wide gap hook and sinker.    Zoom Fluke - rigged weightless on an offset hook.    Crawdad - rigged on a roller or grass jig    Worm - rigged texas w/bullet sinker or weightless on an off set hook    Most of these can be fished on a Carolina rig, Split Shot, Wacky worm and some can be used as trailers on your favorite spinner.

EvkPOPo1aa	I fish for them quite a bit and you will need 10-15lb. test with a steel leader other wise pike will bite it off with there sharp teeth. The best lure to use is a medium size spoon and I get lots with red and white. You need will find them in weedy beds no deeper than 10 feet deep. If you are using live bait then the best bait would be medium to large chubs (minnows). Yes people do eat them and they taste really good but have a lot of bones. It takes a lot of practice to fillet them and even i still miss bones so that will be the hard part.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Pike are delicious but very bony. They get enormous and will hit almost anything that moves, my personal favorites are spinners.

You have to use top water lures that can resemble anything that looks like a frog to a fish. Worms   frogs, fish, and etc should work (live). I would recommend at least 20lb line and you have to use a metal leader to attach the hook to the line or lure. The ones I caught ranged from 2-3 feet.Fish near plants, rocks, or anywhere were you think they can hide|`|zcrJzVauaa	You can eat them, but they are full of bones.......you can fillet them, put the fillets in a pressure cooker.....this will dissolve all those small bones, themn take the meat and make a pike patty(like a salmon patty or cake). Im from the south, and they dont get real big down here, but up north they get huge......they will eat just about anything, minnows, crickets, worms, spinnerbait, crankbaits......use a stong line though, they are explosive fighting fish, even the small ones down here in the dirty south!!!!!

AA11016927	School Nurse and John M are totally correct.(Thumbs up!)     You CAN do it, but you eliminate your casting distance by 40-50%.     And the "spine" of a spinning rod is designed to bend a certain way. If you continuously bend it in the other direction eventually it will break or one of your guides will pop off.     And like John M mentioned, the guides on a spinning outfit are distanced OFF the rod blank to help spinning reels get that extra distance in casting.     It just doesn't work well.    Would you try to put bicycle wheels on a skate board?       Walmart has dirt cheap bait-casting rods ,(Berkley Cherry wood/Shakespeare), that will:    a. HELP you learn how to cast a baitcaster correctly- (I can't imagine how HARD it would be to learn how to cast a BCer using a spinning rod!!!)    No to mention the fact, if you decide to use a spinning rod on your BCer you are telling every fisherman that see's you that you are an idiot.     Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.....    Good luck!    (PS- School Nurse- You got it. It's called a trigger. I think my wife calls "something else" a trigger dilly.....(lol)....Thumbs to ya'll.)|`|ad2c42b343cc4e589a253613aa5f1a34aa	Baitcasting rods have a little "trigger" dilly on the underside of the rod.  Rods for Spinning reels do not.    A lot of rod makers make both baitcaster and spinning styles for each model so you have to look for the "trigger" dilly.      I wish I knew what that thing is called--lol.|`|lECmz3SEaa	As long as it can fit then yes. However I would not put a reel with 120lbs culpability on a 10lb rod, defeats the purpose|`|zcrJzVauaa	You can put it on there, you dont need a hump on the rod, and the eyes dont matter, as long as it fits in the seat of the rod, then go for it. Although a proper baitcasting rod probally would improve on your casting, you can pick up a cheap on at walmart, shakespere is cheap, but pretty good. I would suggest you spend a little money on the reel though, there is nothing worse in the world than a cheap baitcaster reel. You can find some good deals on ebay, ive owned some high end baitcasters, but right now bass pro reels are the bomb, the more ball bearings the better, and i buy mine used off of ebay....the extreme model is nice...most bass pro models are though. Just try and find one with the drilled aluminum spool. I bought a Shimano Curado......but i prefer my Bass pro Extreme or qualifier reel.|`|xtdeTwYmaa	it will if you have a spin casting rod open or closed bail i got a bait caster on an open bail rod it works but if you buy a bait casting rod it will go farter and if you have on of those rods with the same syze eyes then it will work thats the only diffrence between then the open bail spin caster have big and small holes and baitcaster have the same size holes|`|bkhvdfJxaa	if its a spinning reel rod...then no...it wont perform well...but if its a baitcasting rod it would have a trigger...or a hump where the palm could rest on...and it would work...the reason for it to not work well is because the rings in spinning reel rod have big eyes, or holes for some people, and the action of the pole would be reversed which makes it weaker...

CZYXO1NFaa	HELL YES! First Bulger is hurt and hasnt been playing welll either. Warner is a bit of a gamble, but that's why he is still an option in most leauges.    From what we have seen with Warner he can put the ball on the route and has pleanty of people to throw the ball too. The Card's offensive line has only given up a couple of sacks so he is in a good position to run wild in AZ.    The Card's schedule is favorable the next few weeks too! If Warner is still an option then he is a great buy for an injured QB.    Good Luck|`|3Xy2yWcHaa	Yeah, I'd do it. I don't think Bulger will get back to his usual self this season. Broken ribs take time to heal.|`|C1aFhbUMaa	For this week, you may want to snag Anderson of the Browns.  Against a Miami d he should have another great day.  Warner will play but against Carolina at home he won't put up the same numbers he did against the Rams.  I thought Bulger was hurt?  Eli had a good half game last week.  And of course any time he hits Burress it could be six.  Giants v Atlanta.  It may be a slaughter.  I'll string out the ideas but you still have to decide.

Contento il cavaliere va dalla rana e le chiede: "Ciao, rana vuoi metterti con me?" La rana risponde: "NO! E il pisello gli si accorcia di 10 cm. Contento il cavaliere le pone la stessa domanda. "NO" risponde la rana,e il pisello gli si accorcia nuovamente di 10 cm. il cavaliere decide che 30 cm sono ancora troppi eche 20 cm sarebbero stati pi che sufficienti  quindi pone per l'ultima volta la domanda:"Ranocchietta vuoi metterti con me?" E la rana spazientita risponde:  "Che palle, ho detto NO, NO, e NO!"    Spero ti sia piaciuta,a me ha fatto morire dal ridere!

Un paio di buonissime scarpe sono d'obbligo.

Detto questo, preferisco/vo fare jogging la sera per scaricarmi dallo stress, evito di andare vestita col cappotto perch so che morirei di caldo.

Per quanto riguarda l'abbigliamento d'inverno  fondamentale tenere al caldo le gambe per evitare infortuni: io metto i pantaloni della tuta, senza aggiungere altro, perch non voglio avere troppo caldo durante la corsa. Sopra (sempre d'inverno) maglia della salute pi il pezzo sopra della tuta o una felpa, se fa veramente freddo anche un cappello di lana (ma il pi delle volte se  cos mi astengo!). I vestiti li puoi lasciare nell'auto, insieme ad un asciugamano e dell'acqua (questi ultimi li puoi lasciare anche in un punto al bordo del circuito, a portata di mano, se  possibile). Faccio stretching un paio di minuti prima e dopo la corsa, e durante porto con me solo un orologio e le chiavi dell'auto.

Non bisogna vestirsi troppo perch poi si suda e gli abiti impacciano, basta una tuta con sotto 1 o 2 magliette e uno spolverino leggero per tenere lontana l'aria e magari dei guanti. Io uso come pantaloni dei pantaloni tecnici da runner fatti apposta per correre quando fa freddo, perch sono un tipo freddoloso. Costano circa 70-80 euro ma valgono il loro prezzo perch proteggono dal freddo in maniera eccezionale.    Quando invece  estate vado quando  calato il sole e se sudo pazienza.

bB5d5YVeaa	I have been buying ammo and reloading components for the past 2 decades.    Years ago I found that the best deals on bullets for my service rifles were sold in bulk by Midway USA.  So, I bought them in boxes of 1,000 bullets for reloading.    Another great source was when my local Kmart stores (plural) had an end of the season sale on 12 gauge 3.5 inch super magnum ammo.  Boxes of 10 for $4.00 a box (that's $10.00 for 25 rounds and I can't touch the high brass game loads for that!).  I went from one Kmart store to another, buying every box of shells they had.    Right now I am 48 years old and I have enough loaded ammo and components to last me for the rest of my shooting life.    But...as another poster correctly put it, if things really got "that bad", I am sure some ingenious upstanding law abiding patriots would do what they needed to do to secure more ammunition from reliable sources.  Just look at Iraq.  Most guns are outlawed over there, and people seem to have no trouble finding everything from AK-47 rifles to shoulder-fired missiles.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	What was that movie line, "I'll never tell."|`|QO5uS8gEaa	I don't "stockpile" ammunition. I keep only enough on hand for personal use.    I stockpile water, dry goods, and precious metals (gold, silver, brass, lead).|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	If things ever get that bad, a few dozen rounds will suffice to get me additional stocks. And if you don't have what it takes to do that, all the stockpiled ammo in the world isn't going to do you a bit of good. Might as well just turn it in now.|`|AA10644603	I have 20!|`|AA10102776	honestly......... nun yea|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	I have about 30 guns total so you do the math and if the goverment tryed to take them and the ammo away the would never find them and neither would you!|`|lT8MEI6Raa	I've only got about 30 rounds for each gun. If I had more money I'd have more ammo but I'm a poor, married college student with a kid. Money's kinda tight|`|TBAfpnmgaa	Right after the election, I went to a gun show and saw people buying cases of ammo. One guy had a whole pallet load of .223's. I asked him if he was starting his own army, and he just looked around, and said, "no, but in a couple of years, I'll be able to sell this for enough to out my kid through college." I sure hope he's wrong.|`|K1Zfhmf5aa	I have enough. Personally, I would rather have a bullet resistant home, a personal watersource, a few hundred pounds of food per human, a good radio with a hand crank power source, and all the medical equipment I can get my hands on.     But then, who am I to judge?|`|gRodZRi9aa	Like Mr T,  enough reloads to last a lifetime...and I keep loading...|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	I have always found that if you cant hit the target with one maybe at the most two shots then you better haul butt because you are a bad shot.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	I have 50 rds of 8x56R and about 120 of 7.62x54R.

Can't leave it to chance anymore. Thing is a few of my friends know of my quanities so I had to bury everything I don't plan on using. There are only two people I really trust to the location.    What state do you live in? If your over 1,000 miles away I'll tell you. But I will give you the amount of .22LR I have. I have 8,900 rounds packed away. Plus two bricks which have been dipped into which I don't count.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	i've lost track, but you need to go shoppin'
h2KkiKK3aa	two reasons:  one is to allow good airflow while covering the barrel  two is to cover the barrel so you won't burn yourself after rapid firing.  it was made because in war many soldiers were getting burns when trying to hide during a gun fight, when they'd hide, the gun's barrel would often touch their skin and burn them bad, putting them out of commission.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	A shotgun, especially a 12-gauge, can get VERY hot, VERY fast, even after as few as 3-4 shells, depending on the metal.     I burned myself a little last time I went to the range, and I'm thinking one of those would be a good investment.|`|AA10232540	"Shield", not "disperser".  What does that tell you?|`|KDOIKIq2aa	It is to keep you from burning you finger tips on a hot barrel after prolonged or rapid fire.  It doesn't contact the barrel enough to help disperse heat.    "So you are basically saying that it prevents your hand from touching the hot parts of a shotgun?"  Yes.|`|uARQSXomaa	Shotgun barrels get extremely hot after firing a few rounds in rapid succession. Handling the gun safely can become a problem when the barrel becomes heated, so the heat shield gives you something cool(er) that you can touch without burning yourself.|`|HUQMqdDqaa	To shield heat yes, but they also reduce the amount of distortion your sight picture gets from the heat.
PY6mzX1laa	WWE is boring because they not innovative enough to make a storyline.after that,people kepp asking why are wwe storyline is so bad ? well,because they don't have vince russo.  if WWE was like this in future,they gonna be buy by TNA and then TNA make a book that title "The Rise And Fall Of WWE"  and TNA it's gonna be bigger than anything|`|zPxnxWosaa	It's the same thing every week. Lashley in a handicap match or something close to it, John Cena talking garbage and how he doesn't back down from anyone, Flair and Carlito beating on each other. There's no surprises and it gets boring. They need to start a group of guys like the horsemen or DX again that will make people tune in. I really don't know what they should do but I"m getting sick of watching it and fell asleep during tonight's show.|`|Sb8zD5Bpaa	I agree when i saw Raw i couldnt believe Lashley fighting the McMahons again.The PPV was over so they should try and move on create some fresh stories.|`|yLQLBqVLaa	Mmm, well yes right now it is  between a point of Cena(as a Hero) and bad matches with Khali......    I think what the WWE can do is let the young guns bright more and not let Cena carry all the WWE, because is not fair, for cena fans everything about him is good, but this shows you that wwe doesnt care , because Cena has making ratings, and maybe there is a 30%  than people want something new but this70% wont let things happen|`|d11d158c46b97375580b6a62d5079c5caa	two words:      JOHN CENA|`|PT9spOauaa	Because John Cena, thats why.|`|9eayeUf9aa	two words for you        No Trish|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	Because of John Cena, he is so annoying

He keeps playing his politics behind close doors. This is a reason i dont watch raw or smackdown anymore. After I found out how HHH , HBK, of Flair were putting down stars so they wouldnt lose their spot. Never wanting to make new stars. How many stars has either one of them made?     since the very beginning of 2000 until june 2003, HHH Raw record is 44-29-9. of those 29loses, only 8 of them were singles matches. Out of those 8loses, 4were by disqualification. down to 4 single matches he lost cleanly. the 4 are..:    10-02-00 - Kurt angle def. HHH by pinfall.  1-28-02 - Booker T def. HHH by pinfall  3-4-02 - Kurt def. HHH by escaping the cage.  10-28-02 - Kane def. HHH in a casket match.     so now we're down to HHH being pinned in singles matches only twice in 2yrs. so how exactly did he lose there 4 matches..    10-02-00 - Benoit goes after Steph and HHH attacks, Angle grabs a chair, but steph stops him, Benoit hits HHH, Angle slam, Angle is the  1 contender.     1-28-02 - Steph runs out to deal with Christian. HHH goes over to talk to her down off the apron, and next thing you know, Booker gets the Rollup for the pin.     3-4-02 - Cage match - HHH climbs, but steph charges in, chairshots him, crotches him, and thus ties him up in the ropes before singles handedly dragging Angle out for the win.     10-28-02 - Casket Match - HBK appears out of the casket and attacks HHH. Sweet chin music wakes up the crowd as Kane revives, chokeslams HHH and closes the lid.    So out of those 4 "clean" losses on RAW, 2 were by HHH getting distracted and 2 were by outside interference. 3 involved Steph. and one involved HHH best friend HBK.     That should show you what kind of a fair, apolitical, and vulnerable heel champion HHH really is...|`|1rFYvCIhaa	The WWE Championship Match. They always give Cena the ******* belt Especially at Wrestlemania.
471b0f516164655a2182e6d175d1dfacaa	I guess it is like that, but anyone who watched the Suns play without Nash should not have voted for Dirk.

There is a difference.|`|ASY9aUX7aa	jerry west was great dirk choked in the first rd to an 8 seed dont believe the hype with dirk no heart|`|8b6710f934392e0325e57ac49be335ddaa	Naaah... its like getting a lollipop after you get a wound.    The lollipop is good, but it would have been better if the wound would not have occured at all.|`|FlvSHIbvaa	i disagree. I may be a Laker fan but i honestly have to say Nash would have been much more deserving then Kobe and Dirk. Nash got career bests in scoring and assists. Dirk got numbers that aren't that great. I always hated it when the league chooses the MVP based on team success instead of individual talent *cough Kobe.|`|AA10107263	YES. HIS NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN FROM LAST SEASON. DOWN! NASH'S WENT UP. WHY THE HECK WOULD WE CHOOSE SOMEONE WHOSE AVERAGES WENT   D  O  W  N  !|`|63df8e444393fa4ca063d3004e3afd23aa	Jerry West's case is more painful. West played great throughout the 69 playoffs, especially in the Finals. They just fell short again, with Wilt playing a big role in their failure by asking to come out of the game with a few minutes left because of a slight leg injury. He could have stayed in the game and willed himself to play.    Anyway, Dirk's case is more like Moses Malone's in 1982, when Moses's Rockets fell in the first round. Or just like Kareem in 1976, when his Lakers failed to even make the playoffs.
W7Vdy3OVaa	working on your underwater pulls off the dive and turns can help you drop seconds right away....push off hard and streamline for 3 seconds, pull down hard and glide 3 seconds then kick up to the top.  in the long run think about your hips and using them for strength on every pull.  a good drill is "2-beat (kick)cobra"...hips forward when you pull then hold your position (like a cobra waiting to strike) for 1 second.  then kick and dive down underwater while getting your hips up.  let your feet come out of the water behind you.  then add a second kick with your hands still out in front to get back to the surface. repeat.... modern breastroke is all aboout hips forward when you pull and hips up when you kick.  when you kick with a kickboard, make sure you get your butt out of the water.  for swimming 100 breast, do 150's and 200's in practice so you can have the endurance to finish strong.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	im a breaststroker and my time is a 1:13. i would do hundreds, first kicking, then drilling. then swimming. i would also do pulling, use a buoy do a light dolphin kick with breaststroke arms. focus on ur pull downs and ur turns.. u should also work on ur kick and ur endurance by doing like 200s and 400s. u can work on sprints by doing 50s and 25s. good luck!

iyDXt5d9aa	a lot of it has to do with the racket angle. the grips are semi western continental western...ya can look then up online. For a more controlled hit use a semi western/western grip I think.

AvmX85oqaa	I had the same problem. I figured out it was 2 things- simple things that greatly improve anyone's spike. First, is your approach. Just do it, at first I didn't think you had to do it, but it really does give you the speed and momentum to hit the ball. Second, is the swing. It's all in the wrist. Make sure that as soon as you contact the ball that you collapse your wrist and your whole will follow. Just keep practicing, it'll come back!|`|O1ZCb90Jaa	Just pay attention to the timing. When the ball is at the top of its arc, jump before it starts falling. Make sure you bring your arm all the way back until your hand is by your ear and then when you hit it, snap your wrist.    If you were doing that before, then I don't know what's wrong.|`|AGEeipWtaa	Get your timing down? try jumping higher  PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE THE BALL IS EXACTLY.    just practice practice practice. it'll come back to you dont worry|`|tFwKqMuPaa	hey there!!    you should watch this.. it will help..    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqI0QVgl...    good luck!!...i also made the volleyball team for my school!!|`|Uuq0a7tNaa	Well practice makes perfect so practice allot. As for some tips. Make sure you have you're desired approach. For a beginner i would stick to the 3 step approach (left right left jump) starting at the attack line of course. Make sure your eyes are on the ball at all times and as for body positioning stick your stomach out and legs back when you jump have you're arms follow the motion of (for a right handed person, opposite for left) 1. left arm straight up and out right hand  by your face body turned mostly to the right side 2. as you hit the ball hit it at the highest point of you're reach using the motion of bringing back your left hand to your face and extend your right hand straight out and down to hit remember the higher the jump the more downward force. The specific approach is more so my preference many videos and diagrams can be found online which may also help. Good luck, im sure it will come back.|`|3iGoYk0Saa	Your problem is that you keep thinking that you not going to be able to spike the ball. When the ball is a foot above you, be ready. Keep your eye on the ball and make sure it hits your whole hand. Think positive.
fbghv6VRaa	I want Serena Williams to do the double this year with the doubles and singles. I always root for the Brian Brothers i love their game. Safina will win soon she has arrived on the seen.

Serena Williams is good as well but she has already won it before so i think its Dinaras turn to have a turn just like her brother did a couple years ago.     For the mens doubles i want the Bryan brothers to win it. they have had a terrific start and hopefully it can be a terrific end as well.     Good Luck to them all :D    Go SAFINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

KFpG8QHtaa	This is an awesome question...  Both of these guys have been really heating up with the weather, and they both look to end the season strong and put up good fantasy numbers.    Furcal can contribute plus value in 3 categories (runs, steals, average), and potentially dominate in steals.  His HR numbers certainly have the potential to be average from the SS position, and he won't hurt you too much in RBI either.  He plays for a good offense and could score runs at a much faster clip in the second half than he did in the first.    Kazmir can contribute in 4 categories - he doesn't look to record any saves - though playing for the Rays may hurt his win totals.  He has shown the capacity in the past, however, to wrack up big time strikeout numbers while posting much better than average ERA and WHIP.  He's looking like last year's version over the past few starts and should only improve as the season goes on.    All that being said, both players are very good.  My analysis assumed you're in a standard 5x5 league, but I don't even know that.  I don't know if it's roto or H2H, which would also help.  Most importantly, I don't know what your team has/needs.  If you are doing well in steals and can afford to deal them, while you need to boost your strikeout numbers, this seems like a great deal.  I have 4 Yahoo! fantasy teams this summer, and all of mine are pitching-heavy already, so I probably would not make this deal.  It's also important that you have a good backup SS.  The position is stronger this year than it has been in years past, but it's still fairly thin.  I wouldn't consider dealing a player as solid as Furcal unless you have a viable replacement to stick in for him.  It's easier to pull Ks and Ws off the waiver wire on a start-by-start basis than it is to put together good numbers from a middle infielder.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	In std league you should be able to do better. This looks like an offer from someone who is pitching heavy and offering his least for your best. He probably opted for pitching and thought he was fine with Hall, Lugo or F Lopez at SS.  Fucal (whose numbers will pick up) and Jhonny (whose parents lost a spelling bee) are both injury prone and prone to extended hitting slumps. You may need both to make 1 really good SS.  Kaz's numbers are all over the board and you can't tell a good start from a bad. His K's are up but his BB's are way up as well and that usually means that he is just flirting with the egde but his HR's given are up - that means he is losing patience and throwing the ball down the middle.    The trade sucks - counter with an offer for his 3rd round pitcher choice - I know he took one the 3rd. And since he bailed on a SS it was probably Matt Cain who is struggling right now but is a much better pick up than Kaz.|`|OMw30xHfaa	I would actually say that's a pretty good trade since you got Phelttra as backup SS who's doing very well this season.|`|aKPy4Fixaa	Don't listen to the first guy whatever you do! It sounds like he copied and pasted information from a fantasy encyclopedia, and a bad one if that. But anyway, you should take this trade without thinking. Furcal has been really good throughout his career, and is still a good hitter, but most of his value in drafts this year came about from his 38 steals last year. I have watched some Dodgers games, and he just doesn't look to steal as much as owners would want him to. I think he either leads off or bats second, so you shouldn't count on many RBIs from him. Kazmir has very good stuff. Even though he's on the Rays, he'll still get wins if he pitches well. He has very good strikeout numbers, which can help you in leagues with a lot of categories. In a league with categories like K/9, you should take him. He'll probably have a much better year next year though, he's still very young.

The U.S. team is supported by Nike, which is an American brand and is the greatest rival for the German brand Adidas.

But hope he might come back!!|`|8650c0d70e14754c5e748d0c4e1ac0a6aa	Jurgen Klinsmen has dropped out of the running due to  autonomy issues (speculation).  I think he was the right man for the job because he would have brought a lot to the soccer environment in the US.  It would have also validated that the US is serious about an international sport.  Since Gulati and Klinsmen parted on good terms, there is still the possibility of seeing him in the future.  Gulati just needs to let go of some of the authority.    Bradley, the interim coach has hired Nowak as his assistant which makes it an attractive dou for Gulati to keep as permanent coaches.  Only the next 6 months will determine if they stay on.  My feeling is that the will stay through qualifying and in 2008 or 2009 Klinsmen will be right back in the mix here in the US and take over the team.  That's my take on the matter.

HFgyL7Hmaa	The history of association football, which is also known as soccer, can be traced to various traditional football games played in Europe in ancient times, but the modern game has its roots in the formation of the The Football Association (FA) in England in 1863. At the time, football clubs all played by their own, individual codes of rules, and game-day rules had to be agreed upon before they could play one another. On October 26, 1863, some clubs met in London, to create a universal code, that would allow clubs to play each other without dispute. The impact of the FA was not immediate as football was still very much an amateur activity. The first professional clubs were formed after working class people took up the sport, and entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to make money from spectators coming to see star players. Once professionalism took hold, the popularity of the game became immense and was soon spread throughout the world by British expatriates.|`|8e787e44cd5ef3f5ec7b9a4720bcf219aa	ARGENTINA!!!!|`|gfV7jwyVaa	dont know.|`|YXdID8TDaa	in like the 500s there was a  vague version of soccer played by the egyptians. They played with human heads instead of balls. I just had to say that.|`|94504866dc232fba1a5ad63888755bedaa	It started in Florence, Italy. The rules were added later in The 19th century in England.|`|PY6mzX1laa	Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history. According to FIFA, the "very earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence was an exercise of precisely this skilful technique dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. in China."[3] In addition, the Roman game Harpastum may be a distant ancestor of football. Various forms of football were played in medieval Europe, though rules varied greatly by both period and location.    Whilst football has continued to be played in various forms throughout the United Kingdom, the English public schools (fee-paying schools) are widely credited with certain key achievements in the creation of modern football (association football and the rugby football games - rugby league and rugby union football). The evidence suggests that during the sixteenth century English public schools generally, and headmaster Richard Mulcaster in particular, were instrumental in taking football away from its violent "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport that was beneficial to schoolboys. Thereafter, the game became institutionalised, regulated, and part of a larger, more central tradition. Many early descriptions of football and references to it (e.g., in poetry) were recorded by people who had studied at these schools, showing they were familiar with the game. Finally, in the 19th century, teachers and former students were the first to write down formal rules of early modern football to enable matches to be played between schools.    The rules of football as they are codified today are effectively based on the mid-19th-century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played at the public schools of England. The first ever set of football rules were written at Eton College in 1815. The Cambridge Rules were a code of football rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, which have influenced the development of Association football and subsequent codes.    The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools, but they were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club (formed by former pupils from Harrow) in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.[4]    These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863 which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemason's Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.[5] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting, the first which allowed for the running with the ball in hand and the second, obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby football clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, or subsequently left the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.    The laws of the game are currently determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The Board was formed in 1886[6] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is home to the world's first football league, which was founded in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[7] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and the North of England. The Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[8] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board currently consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.    Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world, and millions of people regularly go to football stadia to follow their favourite team,[9] whilst billions more watch the game on television.[10] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA and published in the spring of 2001, over 240 million people regularly play football in more than 200 countries in every part of the world.[11] Its simple rules and minimal equipment requirements have no doubt aided its spread and growth in popularity.

50ea4c09ec81cd5849460755364909dbaa	Per rafforzare le tibie salta a ritmo sostenuto con le punte dei piedi dritte (normale) poi rivolte verso l'esterno, e poi verso l'interno. Circa 10 ripetute da 25/30 salti per posizione al giorno.  Condiziona le tibie colpendo un sacco di Media durezza con Low Kick e M.Kick, da prima in velocit con serie da 15/20 calci (cos fai anche un po' di fiato)  Poi colpi singoli portati con potenza e di nuovo ripetute in velocit. Dopo qualche mese puoi provare a passare al sacco duro, occhio a non procurarti inutili microfratture che ti impedirebbero soltanto di proseguire l'allenamento.  Se senti dolori, dopo allenamento applica impacchi di Caldo/freddo (alternandoli) e mettendo poi un po' di argilla sulle tibie, in modo da far uscire subito eventuali botte ed aiutare il fisico a riassorbirle in fretta.  Circa 1 ora prima del match comincia a scaldare le tibie con olio Thai "fregando" sull'osso con le nocche della mano. Poi applica "boxing cream" (crema thai) sulla tibia, all'inizio una quantit modesta, e falla penetrare con un bel massaggio. Poi uno strato abbondante, spalmalo leggermente in mododa coprire bene l'osso tibiale (deve essere un bello strato) ed avvolgi tutto con estensibile trasparente (la pellicola da cucina) Ora puoi iniziale la fase di riscaldamento pre-match tenendo questo impacco per circa 30min, toglilo poco prima dell'inizio della competizione. L'effetto dura circa 40 min, poco pi. Ti aiuter ad incassare meglio i colpi e a sentire meno l'effetto trauma.  Consiglio: Fai una prova in una sera di allenamento.  Ciao Ciao|`|8631293bd47dfd0d9a245e0c6e5bf6dcaa	Allenale colpendo un buon sacco pesante, ed evita tutte le storie di colpire pali di legno o simili, ricorda un vero Thai Boxer famoso per i colpi di tibia, non rovinerebbe mai le proprie tibie con cui si guadagna da vivere.  OS!!|`|DEcYfkvOaa	Concordo con le risposte precedenti. aggiungo una cosa, invece che colpire i pali di legno a tempo perso prendi un bastone di bamboo (tipo quelli usati per il kali) e te lo picchietti leggermente (non devi avvertire dolore ma un fastidio) sulle tibie da sotto il ginocchio fino all'avampiede (o collo del piede). Ha il vantaggio che lo puoi fare anche al lavoro (se non ti prendono per matto) o mentre guardi la tv, ecc.  Ciao  Train hard fight easy

qipKvVFyaa	Not really... At thirty-four, he's not looking at a great amount of improvement from here on out. Plus he's subject to quite a lot of abuse in Europe for a below-average performance, while in the US he's regarded as almost a deity of the sport. He's going to lift the quality of the league and the profile of the game a lot, and while he might do more for the league than it may do for him, so what? I wouldn't necessarily call that a waste of talent, in fact, I would imagine it's quite the opposite.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	No, he's on a down swing and is struggling with injuries. His days at the top level of the game are numbered. Can't blame him for trying to cash in while he's still able and the MLS needed a "big" name to try and boost the profile of the game in the US.

Go with Addai and Alexander.|`|dc62279ab6560db8325be6a65f03c61aaa	You have a great problem. any combination should get you some serious points, but I would go with Addai and Alexander.

BFSQtLD9aa	Yes. Make the trade. Bush Should be starting soon, and Benson is going to have a breakout year. Trade Green|`|CZYXO1NFaa	Bush starting soon? No way...stay away from that trade, you are in good shape. Duece McAllister is a STUD and has the size and power to hold Bush as a back up for at least another season. Addai is a machine and will start without having to spilt carries with another back.    Benson is good, but you are fine without him. I think loosing Addai would be a big mistake.|`|e29623d659319d4ce17f3d29be5c4265aa	I would keep Addai.  I think Bush is the better talent, but he doesn't play enough.  I also would hold on to L.Evans.  I have Fitzgerald on my team and would unload him for Evans in a heartbeat.  Keep what you have.
Wuc2lAH9aa	Kurt Warner.  He's not starting this week, but should be back for next Sunday, and has the 3rd-best wideout tandem in the league.|`|CZYXO1NFaa	WOW that's a nice roster of RB's! I would definitely do some wheeling and dealing for a GREAT QB! I would first look around at your league and see who is hurting for a RB...they will be much more likely to let go of a top QB for less than someone who is feeling safe.    The way I see it is that you have three tier 1 RB's and two tier 2 RB's. I would put together a trade offer that included one from each, but NOT 2 of your top players. Keep at least two from Westbrook, Peterson (I'm assuming the Vikings Peterson and not the Bears) and Brown.     LaMont will keep putting up numbers, but he has some name recognition.    Look at QB's like Carson Palmer, and Bret Farve...if teams have Romo and Brady and have decent backup QB's then you might be able to get away with a steal! Possibly offer your QB to sweeten it for them.    It really just depends on what the other teams are looking like, do some research and send some feeler offers and get your QB!!|`|luAzceYZaa	DEREK ANDERSON!!!

Run laps around the court. Run suicides on the court. Run in your neighborhood, just get active. Every year when I played tennis, my stamina and endurance in a match would be what I need to play my potential. To increase that stamina to play to the best of your ability your whole match is to be able to keep a high energy level for a long period of time and running helps you do that. This is from personal experience..not sure if this works for everyone.

That one is a no-brainer.    Oh no look at all the thumbs down I'm getting for expressing my own opinion!!! boo-hoo!|`|U7BkuEU9aa	The French Open, a.k.a. Roland Garros, played on clay courts in Paris during the last week of May and first week of June? Just checking, because the Grand Slam being played right now is the Australian Open! LOL    Well, Rafa will be the champion of both tournaments anyhow! ;-)|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Too far away !   But I'd expect to see Verdasco-Nadal final again at Roland Garros. Nadal lifts the 5th trophy. Vamos Rafa !!|`|8rasqlUgaa	Federer will win the france open. He went to france open final for 4 times. It's about time.|`|AA12034105	Haha do you need to ask this question ? :P  Obviously Rafa's taking home that title again ;-) :P|`|VefSnu0Gaa	rafa.-|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	Jo-Wilfred Tsonga definately has a chance. but he wont win, if aussie bernard tomic is in i have a feeling he will make it to the 3rd round. but c'mon it is definately out of nadal and verdasco, so i would say rafa.  thanks lol|`|mGVEeTeOaa	Obviously Nadal
BOcTVYDOaa	Maybe make a video of yourself and put it on youtube. Or, are there any slope style competitions at your ski resort? You should enter some to get noticed.|`|jTaW3goeaa	in addition to showing your skills, show that you truly enjoy snowboarding and that you're a real snowboarder.  It seems like theres so many people out there that call themselves snowboarders that don't have the slightest clue as to what a real snowboarders are.  Real snowboarders are at the mountain on a regular basis working on getting better at the sport they love doing.  Real snowboarders are not those that come just a few times a year and act like complete idiots the whole time they are at the mountain.      Being dedicated to the sport is just as important as being good at it.|`|Unaaay0Caa	to get sponsored you need to have more then basic tricks. if they accepted them almost all kids would be sponsored. getting some cool jumps would be a good thing to show cause most people are better at rails. also where i go they have snowboarding teams and local competitions. you should try enrolling yourself in that. also it would help to get a group of people that know what there doing & know some people. i also have a friend who is sponsored by a local ski shop so where you live you should ask around|`|hODNT0nZaa	It is tough to get sponsored. Your best bet is to get yourself riding on film. Put together a little sponsor-me video about a minute and half long. Show off your strong points. Whether you are better on rails or big jumps, making sure to showcase your talents. Companies, I'm sad to say, focus a LOT on image these days. There are different companies for different styles. Go watch some videos from different companies and production teams. Figure out where you fit. If necessary you can adjust yourself a little bit but BE WHO YOU ARE. Companies want guys who are straight forward, hard working, talented and cool. If you put your heart in it and you have even a little bit of talent you will find receptive companies. Hit their website and get a contact email or phone number. Call them but don't bother them, they don't want some grom talking their ears off every other day. Go to events, enter the amateur competitions and push yourself. Companies look for guys that go for it, every single run. Even if you don't place initially keep at it. Ride as much as you can and progress your riding. There are people riding professionally that were worse then you when they started getting flow. Believe me, I've had friends riding for companies and I was better on the mountain then they were.     Keep at it! The more events you go to the more people you will meet. The random guy next to you in the food line might be the rep for your favorite company. Talk to people, be honest and network. Knowing someone's name is one thing but knowing their products is a huge bonus. Know your equipment and know your tricks.    Also, go over to your local board shop and talk to the guys there, chances are they either have a team or know who you can get in contact with. Be nice to your shoppies, it's what they do for a living because we love it!|`|xjS2Hdjbaa	moderate isn't gonna cut it at all.  first you need to be really really good and stand out more than anyone where ever it is you ride at.  videos won't really help unless you are blowing everyone else away.  and keep this in mind, it's not what you know it's who you know... that helps a lot more than most people think|`|iT5vnplHaa	be good. get vids of urself and pics and make a profile on sponsorhouse.com. spply for sponsorships there. compete in local comps. place. win. there u go
oMjVp4zGaa	Exactly what bass play said: adding, an angler is only as good as his equipment and I ask you how many world war II fighter pilots are still flying? for that matter how many fighters are still in service? Technology has passed you by so go on line to bass pro shops their rods are guaranteed for a year (I have one which is now over 25 years old) get a reel with the most bearings in it you can afford. here is the page for combos.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	just put it on the shelf with your other important stuff. it is time to retire it. there are many good quality, low priced catfish combos available. time to get one. don't go TOO low priced. you might not get the quality you are used to.|`|zcrJzVauaa	You can go to the reel manufacturer and sometimes they have a schematic parts list, so you know everything is there. If that dont work go to walmart and buy you a 733 zebco hawg.......ive landed 25+ pounders with 20lb. test......and they are usually less than 20 bucks.
oMjVp4zGaa	I learned from a ship captain that when washing down reels after fishing (especially in salt water) never run the water on high volume (high pressure) always trickle it. Do yourself this favor, let it flow easily without pressure as the pressure could push the salt into areas it would have never gotten into. I take out about 100 feet of line as well unless my spool is removable which I drop into a fresh water bucket to soak it in. The grease made by shimano is the best lube grease in the world.|`|zcrJzVauaa	Sure, just wash it good and lubricate good when you get back. Dont waste money on saltwater rods unless youre big game fishing, it takes alot to break poles these days.......
UVYEu5Gqaa	It was INTRODUCED to the legislature, it is not a law. It is still a bill, which means that... it is not a law.    According to the posted wikipedia article, "Bill introduced by Bill Rush of Illinois" Not a big surprise in my opinion, but please realize the difference between a bill and a law.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	No, it's a bill up for vote in the House of Reps. Write your congressman if you don't want it to become law (I did). It's a piece of cake to google who your congressman is send them an email. Tell him/her that your vote depends on them voting against it.|`|C3Jl1ytPaa	I have never heard anything about this law and I check the NRA news every day however looking at the link above it sure looks like it has taken effect hopefully this will not last long the bill we really need to watch out fo is hr 45 it gives the attorney general the power to ban pretty much what he wants and with that psychopath Eric Holder as the AG that would be real trouble|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No * and don't look for it to become Law, but if it would, it would be Unconstitutional anyway, Unenforceable, Disregarded, and Disobeyed. " Guns only have two (2*) Enemy's,  Rust and Politicians." Rust can be removed, and so can Politicians.* " Only a Criminal, Tyrant, or Tyrannical Government is Afraid of the Armed Citizen."|`|vQUb2aT1aa	Yes. It did go into effect on 01/06/2009.

jHJ0W9QNaa	i don't trust ESPN at all... a majority of their so-called "experts" predicted an easy Lakers win in last year's Finals, but look how that turned out. power rankings are useless. the best way to figure out which teams are the best is by watching the actual games and looking at the standings.|`|XrCc85kNaa	I dont read some lame azz blogger's rankings...|`|2dgVkcVAaa	yup|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I couldn't care less about those stupid power ranking polls. Only championships matter.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	I don't even look at them so I don't know and I don't really care what the power rankings are, but to some Laker fans or 'Kobe-holics' they would use that to see who's the number one team or who's playing like they're number one.    But I wouldn't know...|`|Xbid2OG8aa	yes|`|ovBNkYtpaa	uhh, maybe some do. i dont... but if the lakers are ranked at 5th in the west than someones got something twisted.     1.lakers  2.spurs|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Man Cavs are the ones on here whining they deserve  1 annoying.  Lakers> Cavs and you will see it at home when Lakers beat them|`|JBuNJJbkaa	heck no|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I have no clue about last week or the week before because I wasn't even on here.     I don't take them that seriously. I mean if we happen to slip to like 4th or 5th place than I would be kinda pissed with the lead we have right now on the West.|`|m9Zuupv1aa	I'm a Laker fan and I could care less about the power rankings. The rankings are all made by other people and their opinions. All the teams at the top have jumped up and down, except the Celtics... When they went 3-7 or whatever they were still  4 after that stretch lol. When the Lakers lose two games they drop to 5th, but what really matters are the results in June.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	power rankings doesn't mean ****|`|JD5NQxeNaa	standings are useless the best way to determine what team is better is by seasonal match ups and more importantly playoff series. Where anything can happen if a team catches fire.
rTbKXMMpaa	I agree Mo williams should be there instead of rashard lewis. Mo is having a better season than rashard Lewis. He should be there instead. And mike brown coaching should be a big thing in cleveland. Just 5 years ago cleveland was a dump. The team stunk. The one thing that people remembered us by was getting destroyed by MJ. Now our coach is coaching the al star game. We have the best record in the NBA. We are perfect at home and we have probably the best chance of winning a title this year. It feels great being a cav fan for so long. Our break is finally here|`|vzH7f7V5aa	It will be Great to watch Mike Brown Coach for the Eastern All-Stars. But Your right Mo Williams should have been in there.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Mike Brown is not a coach.    EDIT: King Mark - A coach can't coach the All Star twice in a row. It's law.|`|m9Zuupv1aa	I agree with the choice. I think Mike Brown doesn't get the credit he deserves. For some reason he is stuck behind someones shadow... I think Jameer Nelson beat Mo for that last spot and i think Jameer played better, Mo will be an all-star one day.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Great!|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I think he totally deserved it! Good luck to him and the entire easter team.  I think Mo Williams should've made the All-Star game, too. He definitely deserves it.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	yeah,good for the EAST!    he will improve EAST defense just like he did for the CAVS!|`|3teWTOPqaa	Cool|`|l0iCqzlQaa	its not really a big deal at all its an allstar game|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i was shocked when i found out brown would coach East b/c i thought stern would pick Rivers again.|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Great! Grand! Super! Splendid! Superb! Outstanding! Marvelous! Wonderful! Awesome! Cool!
D6Llh23Baa	i know english is a fundamentally sound player, just like roy. both are hardworking, consistent, not too flashy but they get the job done.  i've only watched some highlights about english's career so it's pretty hard to compare the two.|`|LGLnItBcaa	Brandon Roy... best player in the NBA! and that's THAT!|`|Xbid2OG8aa	i agree but my favorite player is dj augustin
3teWTOPqaa	I don't believe, I know.    1.Because the Lakers don't play that well defensively, and LeBron have some pretty good supporting cast this year.    2.How Did LeBron's team in 07, who beat the Pistons in 6 games, couldn't get a single win on the Spurs? (FLUKE!)    3. LeBron handles the ball every time for them, but notice how his stats dipped this year with Mo Williams playing?    4. Celtics was struggling to find chemistry at the time, hell are you are saying Joe Johnson is as good as LeBron for taking the Cs to 7 games? Celtics peaked after playing the Pistons while the Lakers peaked during the Spurs series.    5.How come in the Gold Medal game the ball went to Kobe instead of LeBron, hell even Wade did more in that game than LeBron?      EDIT: do you see my point Alpha? We can sit here and ask those pointless questions or we can accept LeBron and Kobe are the best in the league, they both have their positives, and it would bring peace to the world if we can do that.|`|RBdy17Ahaa	If you say so and perfect timing.|`|KezaxDNnaa	1) They both have 9 losses so you fail.  2) The East was garbage in 07 so you fail.  3) Because LeBron plays more minutes and handles the ball more and dunks the ball more. ( He can't shoot. Notice how Dwight Howard also has a high shooting percentage? They only know how to dunk)  4) Different teams. Different results. Useless comparison.  5) Did you even watch the Olympics? Kobe save them in the final game.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	LeBron plays in the east.    Kobe doesn't get swept.    LeBron plays weak teams his first 2 rounds.    If it wasnt for Kobe, USA might have lost. What did LeBron do during the gold medal game? CHOKE while Kobe made those clutch jump shots.    BTW, who shut down LeBron during the Lakers and Cavs game a couple of weeks ago? oh yeah, Kobe Bryant.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Kobe MVP...http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story...    In the final game for gold when they started to slip  LJ and Wade didnt want the ball in the final 4 mins. Coach K pulled Kobe aside and told him to do what he does. Withou Kobe= no gold|`|stdjB5n8aa	can we talk about something other than kobe, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|D61u7t1zaa	Dude Kobe had no offensive help in the Finals. The Celtics were the better team. If you wanna talk stats, I guess Oscar Robertson is the greatest player because he nearly averaged a triple double.    Let the playoffs decide. Stop hating. They are both playing great ball but wait till the playoffs are over till you ask this question.|`|XTRPSHp0aa	Example   -  Gold Medal game in olympics    Kobe scored 10 points under 4 minutes of 4 quarter   he went  4 out of 5   and scored total of 13 points in in 4th he practically saved team USA's  ASSSS    Lebron scored 4 points  going  1 of 5     Oh yea i believe that Lebron is better    HA   eat Sh*T|`|jTyyl5Nkaa	Why dont you hop off lebrons nut sack? People can think whatever they want. get over it, scrub.|`|m9Zuupv1aa	1. Weaker Schedule? Lakers have beat Celtics and Cavs.     2. West was much stronger back then. Pistons were the best team by far that year and choked.    3. Kobe's team is better. Why would Kobe need to pull down 14 rebounds when he has Gasol, Bynum and Odom all of whom have average 10 RPG throughout a season.     4. Celtics were not playing their best ball, Ray Allen and many of the bench players heated up against the Pistons and carried over to the Lakers. KG, Ray-Ray and the Truth saw they were in the Finals and played that much harder because they were hungry.     5. Who was guarding the best player on the other team? Who was taking the shots at the end of the game against Spain? The only close game...|`|n6514FLVaa	yep he still the best player in the game and you really nedd to get laid!|`|Ev3DzQHLaa	1)cause the Cavs have played 1 more game than the lakers.  (here we go with Down Playing Lebrons Supporting Cast)    2) the east was crap that year.ok an Injured Wizards team,the Nets(damn those were Such Hard Teams) and Lebron was a Beast against the Pistons,but then got SWEPT in the Finals.  ahahahha you gotta Agree that Kobe had the Worst Supporting Cast than Lebron(since  Shaq left)  and you Act like Lebron's teammates were just standing there doing nothing in those Playoffs.  "but Kobe's never been out the 1st round without help?"  another Logic used by Kobe Haters.  so if the Cavs go 2 the second round of the Playoffs its cause Lebrons teammates carried Lebron there,right?sounds Stupid,but why use it ONLY on Kobe.    3)cause hes passes and hes a SF so he should get rebounds,and has a Better FG% cause he goes to the Paint alot.did you watch Lebron against the Magic,brick jumpshot after brick jumpshot.    4)another dumb Logic by you.  i guess the Hawks were a Better team than the Lakers since the hawks took the celtics to 7 games.    5)wow another Dumb Logic.    Look man, Lebron is a good Player (and should win MVP)but i just find Kobe better cause of his Style,he shoots from the Outside and doesn't Depend on driving to the paint(like Leborn does)and he can drive when he wants too.|`|j29eHSDqaa	Great Q.    Now, lets see...    1.-Wrong, Both teams are tied with 36-9    2.-Because LeBrons is playing in a weak conference with only one strong team = Pistons and Kobe is on the Wild Wild West with the Spurs, Mavs & Suns back to the 07 season.    3.-You already answer this... "Kobe has a better supporting cast".    4.-Because the game was already lost at the beginning of the 4qth.    Besides... "Uncle Dave" has helped the Celtics all the way to the championship, it's a fact, everyone knows that.!!!!    5.-Because Kobe was the "captain" of the team and the captain doesn't have to be the best scorer, he was the "leader" and the Dream Team won the "Gold" again.        --------------------------------------...|`|Y46o8CFiaa	Kobe is only good in one thing and that is showing off, players like mj, lebron are always better in team play and that is what makes them good besides their skills, for myself i like wade in miami way more then kobe.|`|LGLnItBcaa	1. well the eastern conference only has two other elite teams (Boston & Orlando)    2.Once again, look at the east compared to the west when Lebron made the finals [but i'll admit he did dominate Detroit]    3. Like you said Kobe has a better supporting cast around him, so dont depend on him to have the ball every possession like LeBron    4. ok... i'm guessing you havent seen the christmas day game    5. This deserves no answer at all... what a stupid question.|`|8M5C8T5Uaa	1. Lebron plays in the east and not in the west.  The east is basically all mediocore teams except for top 3 or 4 the west has 8 or 9 really good teams and the rest are trash.  Cavs only play good teams on west twice where lakers play 3 or 4 and only play east teams twice whereas cavs play them 3 or 4.    2. Once again Lebron did it in the east, secondly his team at least had an allstar in big z whereas kobe had trash of all trash.  Do you know where those teamates are now??   Smush Parker out of the league  Cook sitting on the magic bench with no playing time  kareem rush sitting on indiana bench with no playing time  kwame brown joke of the decade as a draft pick    3. Kobe plays in the triangle offense, where everyone has the same oppotunity for a shot.  Even look at jordan his career high as a bull under phil jackson for assists was 6 he never got above that in the triangle.  All lebron does for offense is run in the middle of the court and throw the ball out.    4. Ray Allen couldn't hit a shot at all against atlanta or cleveland and lebron shot like what 27%?  Are you also saying that Joe Johnson is better than LeBron because he got the celtics to 7 games with a worse line-up.    5.  Did you see the finals in the olympics or are you just reading the stats sheet??  The last 5 minutes when Spain was within 2 points who did everyone on the US team defer to?  Thats right Kobe, he does all the stuff not shown on the statsheet like defense|`|frNinsBjaa	only laker fans believe that kobe is good|`|uxregJ0faa	Another one. Snore. Every time L.A plays all of you show up.      In case you did not watch the gold medal game Kobe made big shots to helps U.S.A win the gold medal. Thought id throw that in
KIOR56r6aa	If they make a stable let's call the stable "Snorefest". Why?    Umaga : A jobber, yet so many idiots want him to face Taker at WM 25    Khali : Enough said    Kozlov : Boring, yet so many ignorant wants to see Taker vs Kozlov at WM 25 in the f*cking streak vs undefeated streak, They believe this will be a 5 star match, but I believe in you, 5 stars out of possible 100 stars.    WQ : Taker owns them all.|`|dfcwNAsOaa	lol    umaga|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	You have style, nice job.      Umaga wins!|`|8Try9VSqaa	it would be dumb, if two of them fought maybe it be better but if it happned to be a triple threat i put my money on khali.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	It'd be like that time umanga and khali had a conversation in 2007.  And I would bet on Vlad.|`|f8cabbb3ae54e2b5465f2c3f517767a2aa	well umaga does speak english very well he just talks like that in the wwe  but i think vladimir kozlov would win cause with all the intense training he has gone though like his work out his training in martial arts ect|`|6LQNK51uaa	Umaga==>Owwqahdbkhjfd samoa..hurra gerts(in short I ll do a hulla dance)    Khali==>Khali bhi nachega(in short let me join u)    Kozlov==>Dublo Dublo E willa seey my Russian dance..tah tah hey     But it would be one of the most hillarious moment in WWE..like when Khali and Umaga talked with each other last year.    WQ-->Umaga is the better one|`|GJQIL0RZaa	kOL|`|nzKo4TFvaa	give some respect to other languages   WQ khali|`|7rpILeYtaa	Kozlov,  he is still yet to be pinned or made to submit|`|NXktxy8jaa	Hahahaha! That Would be hilarious!     WQ: Tough, but Im going on a limb and choosing Vladimir Kozlov. He has incredible strength, and proved that he does when he eliminated the Great Khali from the Royal Rumble match. Umaga has the power as well, and he knows more moves, but the chances are that Kozlov would reverse them. The Great Khali would be a good contender to win as well thanks to his massive size and power, but his speed is very slow and chances are that Umaga and Kozlov would team up and go against Khali.    Winner: Vladimir Kozlov|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the great kahli  the great khali and umaga would join forces and take down vladimir kozlov and the great khali would turn on umaga 1.2.3 winner the great khali|`|smcDn76jaa	That would be hilarious. It would go down as one of the most funniest promos in history. Throw in Kizarny it would be even better.    WQ-Umaga is the best, but Khali would probably win.
Gj8JTJGRaa	To the person who said tyson would win.      did you know that when George foreman made a come back he was offered to fight mike tyson,but when mike was asked about it he said "NO WAY im not fighting that animal"    and correct me if im wrong but Ali destroyed foreman so it would be an easy task for ali to destroy Tyson.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	Ali ,To clever he 'd have just picked him off|`|A3RU9L1Raa	It already happened in '62.. Ali defeated Sonny Liston..a Tyson clone. Ali's footwork and reflexes would keep him well clear of Tyson's 'raging bull' strength..and Ali would have picked him off at will|`|aDDZu9bPaa	It'll cause controversy but I reckon Tyson would've won easy in his prime, the guy was an animal and felt no pain.    He would've been regarded the Greatest had he not gone of the rails but he did and he wasn't the greatest but no one couldv'e beat him at his height, well maybe Frank Bruno could've.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	ali would ko in 9|`|dh48AkbCaa	ali by tko in 9 or 10 rounds      I done wrestled with an alligator, done tussled with a whale  I hancuffed lighting thrown thunder in jail  yesterday I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick  Im so meanI make medicine sick.     muhammad ali|`|6rxhges4aa	they didn't call ali "the greatest" for nothing.    tyson was fearless and strong but ali had a wonderful ability to spot openings in even the most inpenetrable defence and use his speed to exploit it to the full.    he would just duck and weave and when the time was right............|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Ali would have out paced him.|`|amz2nrdCaa	the it would be a case of Tyson who???|`|bad0557eb889b7d5defa8f9ed2532403aa	Not only is Ali a better fighter than Tyson he is a better speller than you!

(Tyson)|`|kg33NLi3aa	Tyson in Rd's if he was at his best but if Ali lasted  to the end of the fight 12-15 rounds then Ali wins|`|u86sLCAZaa	Tyson was Ko'd at 24 yrs old by the immortal Buster Douglas! Ali was only stopped once. He was 38 and his corner stopped the fight.   Tyson would have to Ko Ali. Liston, Frazier, Lyle, Shavers and Foreman couldn't. They were all considered alltime punchers. Only Frazier ever knocked Ali down. That was in the 15th rd and Ali was up at the count of 2.   Also keep in mind Tyson lost ALL of his biggest fights. He was beat 2x by Holyfield and once by Lewis. Both fighters were older than Mike.   (Spinks was a Lightheavy and Holmes was 38.)    This fight would be a mismatch! Ali would beat him faster than you can say Buster Douglas!!|`|vQ75GgNnaa	Ali would have won in the distance, he was fitter and faster and Tyson could not keep the pace.  Big fight though.|`|qCWin81saa	boxing has moved on over the year and people skill range has increased significantly so bearing that in mind id say it would be an easy win for tyson|`|DokumF0baa	Ali would pummal Mike, because Mike gets tired very fast, and Muhammed has his good left arm.|`|uzepqbXIaa	tyson could only ever fight on the inside always walking forward looking to get in close before throwing the bombs.  Ali would move around and have tyson on the floor before he even got in close enough to land a punch.    It would be a mismatch.... think of recent, Jeff Lacy vs Joe Calzaghe.  over 1000 punches landed, cos lacy is just like tyson, and calzaghe knew it|`|F02AJUikaa	Tyson circa '85 could have really given Fight-of-the-Century Ali a run for his money.  What people forget about Tyson is that, once upon a time, he was both a powerhouse AND a skillful, defensive fighter, instead of just the freight-train-in-trunks he turned into later in his career.  I don't know that a young Ali could stand up to those punches long enough for a young Tyson to get tired.|`|ixhatH12aa	tyson would KO him in very few rounds|`|oQILN5tzaa	it would be a classic but ALI would have found a way to win maybe with a late ko however TYSON against foreman liston et al would be something else altogether|`|g6EFgw5Vaa	ALI WINS, but to the people who say tyson was a liston clone or just like lacy are stupid, he was much more talented than those two, tyson had much faster hands than liston better combinations faster footwork and punched just as hard, also when liston fought ali he was reported as 32 but could well of been older, tysons prime was 87-89 when he was what 22- 23?. no tyson was very good and talented but ali was all those things but way smarter and braver than tyson and if bonecrusher smith and tony tucker can find a way to spoil tysons rushes then ali goes a step further and beats tyson on points maybe even stops a tired and frustrated tyson late on, but if i had to say id go for tysons youth helping him see the final bell, ALI ON POINTS|`|GPcOK1M3aa	HEy Packer  If this is truly the case, explain how George Foreman wins the title and/or goes toe to toe for 12 tough rounds with a prime Holyfield, yet Big George was a solid 20 yrs past his prime!!!    Your arguement is beyond weak! Fighters in the past made porportionatly less money. Because of that they made far less money and had to be more active to keep up the cash flow.
3OV4Pl64aa	60 wins they might not have any standout player but that bench could be a starting unit so they pretty much always have decent players on the floor|`|lVPRQj9faa	Those guys are good role players. I think they can win more than 40 or 50 games.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	you don't need all stars to be good and i think about 55 wins great team and al jefferson should be a all star|`|WZvny7mMaa	I would say about 56 wins|`|2dgVkcVAaa	50 wins|`|xBmGtq9waa	58-24|`|i0Igqvroaa	45|`|qJwLCjK5aa	You have a lot of young talented players and some very wise veterans about 55 to 60 wins|`|AA10380012	If they had great chemistry 72+ wins it might not have all stars but it has 2 former All Stars and a bunch of great role players i see your point of either players that are really good players or maybe you think at least some of these people got snubbed. But JR Smith and Sammy Dalembert arent on the same level as any of these other players.

Those are some pretty big numbers.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Did he injure any one this game?|`|WZvny7mMaa	Andrew Bynum played a great game tonight. Bynum has a lot of potential to be a future star in the NBA.

rJMZdp04aa	I can't see it being Matt Morgan.  The ENTIRE idea of the MEM is a Group of Former World Champions.  Jerry & Jeff Jarrett have both stated that , and that they don't want to change that.    Morgan is not a Former Champion , thusly , I don't see it being him.    I do However , see it being a Traitor from the Frontline.  Joe , AJ , Rhyno maybe.  Since Sting Appears to be on his way out of the MEM & possibly Joining the Frontline - It would only make sense to swap a Member.      WQ - Pretty Obviously Sting.  I could see it Being Angle as Well , just for a Twist.  Could be because he views himself as higher than the MEM itself.|`|5oaOOquXaa	I     think       Samoa    Joe     might    join     the    Main   Event  Mafia.|`|UWJinEbIaa	The only person that I can think of is......Ric Flair.   He fits the mold of grumpy old man who was great 20 years ago and "made" pro wrestling the way it is today.  That or they will drag Scott Hall out of the local strip club.|`|SsodRf4kaa	I agree with you about Matt Morgan and Sting. If not then they will probably add Abyss so that he could seek revenge on Matt Morgan.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Matt Morgan fits really good! but after TNA last night it would be a little too predictable.. maybe someone that just signed a conract with TNA.. or even Kip James, if Samoa Joe joins it it would rock!

That would be pretty good.|`|VmoNpWddaa	Matt Morgan fits well. But most of the guys in MEM are older and more experienced. I think maybe Mick Foley. Lol.|`|7BS1L0oBaa	Cute Kip will join    Sting will leave    but i'm more concered on who the next Member of John E Radic's Empire will be     The Snakepit Champion John E Radic announced on his Myspace that there is a new member and it will be announced at the Snakepit event at Campbelltown Leisure Centre  Botanic Grv. Campbelltown  South Australia on the 15th of Febuary 2009    sorry i'm more into local wrestling|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Matt Morgan is a nice fit, and they seemed to talk about him like they liked him. Otherwise, maybe they will bring someone in from outside of TNA?    Sting is prob on his way out, just from his attitude.     Oh, maybe it will be one of the refs into the MEM?
TWQNYhVVaa	Yes I agree,most of the stuff he said to an extent is true,he does the work,and gets cut because of Edge,Hardy gets cut because of drugs and everyone still cheers for him,I like Jeff too but I still like Matt better,and the Lita thing,it got blown out big time,I know she was a heel but chanting **** and having a "Ho sale" for her last match was just retarded.|`|5iFsy1Dlaa	its there job to be hated and they have to deal with it. its not easy for them to sacrifice themselves like that but somebody has to be a bad guy for the fans to hate or it wouldnt be worth watching.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	I agree. Matt was always my favorite. Not just because of now, but because everyone would always love jeff for jumping high. I liked matt's technical skill and hard work.I think this is wrong too.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Hopefully this heel turn will open up doors and avenues for Matt Hardy. As the months progress his character will turn darker and darker and this will probably equal a WWE or WHC (assuming he gets drafted) title shot for him.    When it all boils down, Matt Hardy is hands-down the better wrestler than Jeff Hardy.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Agreeded|`|yb67y0AWaa	agree|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Matt Hardy is living proof of the old saying "nice guys finish last".  A guy who comes to work, does his best, doesn't complain, and looks out for other people always gets overshadowed by the arrogant showoffs and the likable screw-ups.  I know that feeling very well.    What's wrong about this (in the WWE) is it's only when the "nice guy" gets angry, says he's tired of being overlooked, and does "bad" things, does he get rewarded.    The WWE does not reward the faces; the WWE FANS do not reward the faces.  The heels get the championships and the glory; the faces get turned into jobbers.  The fans love the heels because they are more "interesting"; the fans heap scorn on the faces for doing the "right thing".    I don't blame Matt at all for getting fed up with it.  "Nice guys DO finish last".|`|4aPfLJVMaa	lol u started crying, its fake....|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well I know what you mean but it is their job to be hated so that is why they do stuff like turn on their brother and cut all ties to them but just sit back and watch a great storyline unfold|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I agree with you, except about loving Jeff, I don't care for him. Matt is a great wrestler.     Consider this, Matt is good at being a heel that he made you post this. That's how good he really is at his job.|`|RBjJ4lBOaa	well first off its all scripted, so they're really close in real life. i like the fact that matt is turning heel. it adds a new twist to their relationship and perhaps the emergence of christian.|`|Gr7My8FTaa	i think that they should have made jeff hardy the heel instead of matt hardy but i agree with u.|`|HnKKJwnBaa	i agree with you because Matt and Edge are really good wrestlers|`|JwW7j8yYaa	Yes I agree with you, I felt so bad for him. I never understood why everyone loved Jeff sooo much. I always liked Matt better, but not many did. Also, it makes me mad that when a wrestler turns heel, people hate them for no reason. I still like him, and a like a lot of heels, I don't care what thew crowd says. Dood question, it is good to find someone who finally agrees with me.|`|FN9G8hTbaa	exactly.  i dont even like jeff, but the way the crows reacts pisses me off. edge and matt hardy are great people and wrestlers, and just because they are the "bad guy" they get disrespected. i think some people should show some respect to people who could kick their ***
4KTe107Yaa	Lito Shepard. He don't even want to be there|`|J3kfQtViaa	Lol @ brookings, i actually missed what happened because i wasnt paying attention to the game anymore b/c i was pissed. lol.

I think with another bench player we can get a young pro-bowl caliber player such as Mario Williams, Patrick Willis, or Antonio Cromartie. Actually, they don't have to do a combo trade, the team they trade with should give some extra players.    Steelers- I think we should let Heath Miller or Casey Hampton run off. Hampton is troubling with weight (LOL) and Miller is getting much slower each game. Miller could be traded to get a better offensive line because they already have a good TE in Matt Spaeth or could be traded for a young defensive player to up their arsenal. A player like Darren Sharp (another great vet) or Sean Taylor (another great vet) would be great. Hampton should be traded for another DT.    Overall, the Ravens would be very smart to trade off Ray Lewis, even get Joey Porter/James Harrison/DeMarcus Ware type of player, too.|`|GTyFHPlKaa	For the Bengals, either Chad Johnson or Carson Palmer.    Chad because he NEVER concentrates on the game, just getting a laugh.    And Carson because he's just a ***** anyway.|`|c6q3EERdaa	As hard as it is for me to say this, I'd like to see the Rams get rid of Orlando Pace. He keeps getting hurt year after year, and he is aging. The Rams need to get younger (and have more depth) on their offensive line.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	For the Titans, I'd say Lindell White then Vince Young.

xQ84yHcjaa	I ussually would agree with Bluegirl but this time I dont. Ive had those gloves before and they are not great. I personally would have to say either Adidas FS Cup Durables (I have them right now, pretty good), Brine 5x and up, Adidas FS Ultimate's, Adidas FS Al-rounds, or Nike T90 Confidence gloves, (although there are no Fingersaves, the grip makes up for it.) I am a GK for my high School so that is my sources, and I have seen and used all of these gloves.|`|eb7cd5109669ea133aab3557f5ad92feaa	nike is always the best. well i play midfield but i tried my teams goly gloves and it is comfortable and it is nike. i am not sure if it comes in color.|`|7lSiqws3aa	i heard iker casillas uses a four fingered one, he says its key to his good goalkeeping not sure if its custom made tho, could be but you might wanna check em out. its from adidas i think.|`|SjNjtmCjaa	http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...

nooi0ldjaa	30-06 or .270 would be great!    good luck, safe shooting.    please, remember just because you have them in your area, doesn't mean you can legaly hunt them.  you need to check with local fish & game dept to check season's and licneses. and legal areas to harvest a bear.|`|N8AJnAbuaa	shotgun|`|fjT0GoSqaa	Why do anti hunting loons pollute the hunting section with their drivel?

I like a 30 cal for bear hunting but a .270 will work well too. There also have been many bear killed with the old .30.30 and .32 spec.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	crossbow ...dont be a wimp|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Wow, the anti's are out in force tonight.  Hey anti-hunting people, this is the hunting section.  People here kill animals.  And eat them.  If you don't like it, leave.  We are going to keep killing and eating them regardless of what you say.    Now, as for black bears, pretty much whatever you use for deer will work for black bear.  The last time I went out I also had deer tags, so I took a 6.5x55 Swedish mauser with 140 grain spitzers.  I got the deer, I never saw a bear.  I would advise that you take whichever deer rifle you are most comfortable with.  Pretty much anything bigger than a .243 should do just fine.  If you are using anything under .30 caliber, go with the bullets at the heavier end of the spectrum for that caliber.  You don't want to use lightweight varminting bullets.
UoUaO52taa	Pat LaFountaine. Debued in 1984 the yr after the last of the Isles' 4 stanley cups. One of the greatest (argubly the greatest) american players of all time. 6th all time scorer for NY    Oilers. Ryan Smyth. The longtime captain. A gritty guy who was the Oilers for so many years. The deal that sent Smyth to the Islanders was the worst in Edmonton since Gretzky was dealt to LA    Penguins. Syl Alps. A very good player in the 70s, never came close. In a few yrs Crosby or Malkin could own this if they never win a cup. Both are more talented but Alps gets it based on longevity    Red Wings. Eddie Giacomin. Very deserving, never won a cup and didn't deserve to be dumped to detroit by the Rangers    Flames. Jarome Iginla. In my opinion the greatest player in Flames history, the only competors Flurey, MacInnis, Venon, and McDonald all won the cup in 89    Canadians.Saku Koivu. The inspirational captain since 1999 the Habs haven't won a cup in 16yrs the longest span in team history. This was hard    Flyers. Eric Lindros. Love him or hate him no one can deny his talent and what kind of player he was    Edit: The Viktor the heavysoviet part through me off alos refering to yourslef in the 3rd person. Plus the insulting Kimmy seemed weitd. Also the fact I had (or though I had) you as a contact and the contact sign didn't appear. Also there are alot of impersonator trolls on here. LITY, Bob, Spud to name a few. Thought this might be it|`|RnCDov3Caa	im thinking jerome iginla, i no im not taking in consideration long time ago, but jerome is the best power forward in the league|`|r5V3ZNGfaa	^^^^Okay... YOU WIN, Jacoby. Lol. I'll just toss some names in, if I think of some, that may not be "the best players" but ones that I think deserve a mention. Cheers.    Pens -  Pierre Larouche. Youngest player to 50 goals until Gretzky came along.  Jean Pronovost. 1st Pens player to score 100 points in a season.    Flyers -  Pelle Lindbergh. If you don't know why, you might not know what's going on right now.  Jeremy Roenick. NOT the "best player" but I think he deserved a Cup.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1) The best Islander to never win a cup as an Islander.  I have to go with Lafontaine.  He's the highest scorer in islander history without a ring.    2) The only Oiler that comes to mind is Ryan Smyth, but I have issues with calling a guy who averages 57 points every 80 games as a 'best'.  The fact your 'best' player is a 57 point guy is the reason you aren't winning Cups.    3) The best Pittsburgh Penguin to not win a Cup.  This is a tough one because the answer is Rick Kehoe, it was his records for goals (career and season), assists (career), and points (career) that Lemieux broke, and he's still the highest scorer in Penguins history who didn't win the cup as a player.  The key phrase being 'as a player' because Kehoe was an assistant to both Bob Johnson and Scotty Bowman during their 2 cups.  So, he has a couple of rings...as a Penguin....but not as a player.      4) I'm going with Reed Larson.  He's the highest scoring defenseman in Red Wings history from a point/game perspective and the highest scoring Red Wing without a ring.  Former captain and still holds the Red Wings record for hardest shot with a 103.9mph shot in 1979.    5) This one was easy, Jarome Iginla.  No explanation required.    6) This was an easy one as well.................who's the highest scoring Canadiens player since 1993.  Saku Koivu.  See, easy!    7)  The list of extremely good players who never won a cup for Philadelphia is a LONG one.  Propp, Hextall, Kerr, Howe, Lindros, LeClair.................take your pick because you can't go wrong with any of them.  I'm going to take Lindros because his record as a Flyer puts him in the top 10 of all NHL players in history from a points/game perspective, and his 4 straight seasons of 1.5pts/gme or higher has only been matched by Gretzky, Lemieux, Orr, and Esposito.......and 3 of those 4, are in the Hockey News 5 greatest players in NHL history.  You can't get into loftier company than that!|`|axxQzOCHaa	Islanders = Pat LaFontaine (where do I start .. Not just in the NHL but he was also a star player for Team USA in international play. He also has the distinction of having played for all three New York state teams - Islanders, Sabres and Rangers)    Oilers = Doug Weight (Jacoby has a very good point with Ryan, but a friend of mine idolises Weight, so I nominted him for Travis)    Pens = Evgeni Malkin (in my opinion, he's a better all-around player than Crosby)    Red Wings = Gerard Gallant (one of the best players from the Maritimes of all time   (he is from PEI, like Brad Richards) and put up good numbers while on Yzerman's line in the late 80s and early 90s)     Flames = Jarome Iginla (where do I start especially if you're a Team Canada fan as I am)    Canadiens = Saku Koivu (where do I start .. especially if like me you root for the Habs as well as Team Finland)    Flyers = (as the brother of a Nordiques fan I cannot believe I am saying this) but I am nominating Lindros (yes the expectations on him were huge, but when healthy, he put up good numbers)

That's not that hard to understand.|`|wrhqkEiMaa	YAWN.....get over it MJ, they won the world cup fair and square.|`|p1kmZziVaa	Calm down Sherlock Holmes...    edit- so you're justifying the fact that it's ok if other countries are in scandals because Italy has "bigger" ones?|`|7Xridrxaaa	hahahaha i remember that... they looked seas and mountains for articles in goal.com about corruption scandals in other countries to cover up their own hahahaha the fact is that the serie a is no doubt a corrupt league. It is true about every league being corrupt a bit but for Serie A to be one of the top leagues in the world... it shouldnt happen, but i also think you shouldnt translate that into the National team cause all the merit goes for the Italian national team who played a good world cup|`|mvJXPDLgaa	Bella,Fresha$$ , the Calcio and Italy  can all kiss my beautiful a$$!!!!|`|a2ad32848d176ccd23fce84af9334c40aa	Italy won the World Cup, none of the hispanic teams did, so BLOW ME!

p1kmZziVaa	Have you heard of Blagojevich? That's what you call corrupt!    Noooo!! I swear, he was the Illinois governor. He was kicked out yesterday. Big American news.. duh    http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/blago...    Can you ever NOT talk about me. Stupid fat lard.  How in the world is that ignorant? You're so stupid, it still govt. issues that lead up to Obamas seat. Retard. Btw, zizi isnt an Italian word.    I don't want to lower my IQ to your level (lower than s***) so do me a favor and piss off and stop talking about me. Go play in the corn fields.    "hahah " "haha"  you're such a hypocrite. idc if you dont want to know my opinion bc yours aint worth jack to me either. get over yourself and move on.    Shut up for once in your life, you really are stupid. "I dont know how we went to blah to blah" Then shut the f*** up and don't open your mouth. You're the worst liar ever.    Nina - then what was the point of bringing those Italians in it? Only to piss off other Italians. Stop being a biased French fan (if you even are French)  for once and open your eyes.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	When was Moratti caught?    I wished he was. Besides Moggi was not even the president. That is another difference.    And did you get offended by a surname without even knowing who Blagojevich is? Its top American news man, not some small thing. Besides corruption in goverment is a rather more serious issue than sport corruption and not only that.    He tried to sell Obama's senate seat once he became President and has been on pretty much every talk show in the US about it.  @ Rafa: Will you cut it out please. It's hardly her fault if he is not full-on American (which most Americans aren't anyways) and has Serb blood. I mentioned Blagojevich on Simpson's day many of times and it was NOT racist. Jeez|`|7Xridrxaaa	He is prime minister of Italy... he will never get caught haha    Edit: shows how igorant some people are in this place hahahaha i cant believe they are comparing some idiot governor to the prime minister of Italy hahahaha and Italian Stallion is hating on us Hispanics cause he has a small zizi hahaha    @ignorant bit(h: yes mam haha its called mocking haha and oh god have you even heard him talk? your smarter than him for gods sake! I know my politics idiot. You know your intentions behind mentioning the dude hahaha thats what makes you a bit(h hahaha and i love pointing it out cause Blago has nothing to do with Serie A if you ask me    @Marco: at least you try to see her flaw hahaha and try to cover it up. Thats good. Maybe you can convince her to stop doing it    @Imilya : haha wtf? more corn jokes? idk wtf i have to do with corn! I am not a big fan of it if you want to know haha and sure i talk about you all the time if you want to know.... hahahahaha wtf nobody even gives a damn about you seriously if your IQ would be higher than mine you would be smart enough to at least try not make your ignorance this obvious    @Imilya: wtf? ok i didnt want to know your opinion anyway.... idk how we go from corn to your opinions but ok|`|gpNIG15eaa	Moratti owns Inter Milan,Moggi owns Juventus and Berlusconi owns Milan.

Q2S4w8xZaa	I can't wait for Machida and Silva, I agree that is going to be a great fight. I don't think BJ and GSP will disappoint either.     I'm gonna go outside the box though, and say that the first fight of the night will set the tone for the whole evening. Nate Diaz and Clay Guida are going to put on a real show for us tomorrow night. Guida just never stops. He's a cardio machine and he's going to come right after Nate. Nate has quietly gone undefeated in the UFC and has managed to stay out of the spotlight. I think these guys are really gonna bang, and I really can't wait to see it.     Bottom line: We're all gonna win tomorrow night. I absolutely cannot wait. It's been a great few weeks for MMA!|`|ULw1777caa	Bonner and Jones.  Machida and Silva will be a bore fest unless Silva Ko's him.|`|ceGeKMyTaa	Penn vs GSP!!        Bonner vs Jones should be exciting also
reIMLCKkaa	It was a dirty fould, He should be suspended. He wrapped his arm around his neck and slemmed him to the ground for no reason. There was no play on the ball at all. Perkins should have got his *** kicked. The Piston were going to lose anyways so they should Wallace should have allowed him to Punch Perkins in the mouth for that cowardly cheap shot|`|VzkpEp4waa	Perkins isn't good and was getting frusturated that Lil Maxiell was getting all the rebounds from Garnett, Davis and himself.  So he did what any other dumb big guy does, tries to throw them down!|`|uUU6XBhfaa	Yes I saw it. I think Perkins did it on purpose no doubt and the refs called it correctly.     P.S. Maxiell would of ripped Perkins apart.|`|cR7CpgCLaa	jason maxiell should have kicked his asss.  perkins is a fcuking bum!|`|8vF8fneHaa	yea...perkins did a dirty play on Maxiell....But Maxiell did the right thing to push him|`|l0iCqzlQaa	celtics dont play like pussys.

1uSoU8Lpaa	I met Ryan Braun in Milwaukee when I bought a new Toyota. For one day, one hour only he was signing for people who bought a new Toyota. It was cool, I was the last one and talked to him for about 5-8 minutes. I will never forget it. He was extremely laid back and laughed at my lame questions. He left when a huge black suburban came to take him back to wherever he came from. It was in June or July this past year and one thing I asked him was, "How many home runs are you going to hit this year?" He laughed and said, "Hopefully a lot" 37 turned out to be pretty good.|`|3YmVHinRaa	no unfortunately ur luky wat did he buy?|`|SuHwCVDFaa	I just got back from the movies with my friends and jimmy rollins was in the same theater as me.  I went up to him and he said he would give me his autograph after the movie. My friends and I ran out to try to find him after the movie but we saw he was with his girl and we didn't wanna bother him...he seemed like a real nice guy though.|`|a51AvQrlaa	Carlos Lee at the Airport|`|4iQSHyScaa	I met Derek Jeter about six years ago when I was playing in a baseball game at a local field and he paid a visit for charity. I got him to sign a ball for me. He didn't seem too happy to be there or to meet any kids. Probably didn't help that I told him I didn't like the Yankees.|`|Hdc0wxNDaa	I was at the Union Train Station in Los Angeles about a month ago, and I swear that I saw Matt Kemp of the Dodgers walk right by me. I was gonna say something, but I didn't want to bother him..   I asked my friends for backup, but none of them knew who he was...  I guess being a baseball junkie doesn't always go good when your with your girls.   Might I add:  You guys have great stories!|`|K2mZFWf5aa	no|`|413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	While I was working at Disney World in 2006, I visited the Swan and Dolphin resorts where the winter meetings were being held. At one of the restaurants, I saw Lou Piniella dining with some of his friends. I didn't approach him, but it was still a great experience even if it was only a brief one.|`|JSryPP8faa	Bill Doran at the airport after an exhibition between my Mets and his Astros. He was gracious enough to sign my game ticket stub. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Doran  Orlando " El Duque" Hernandez shopped at my store with and interpreter and signed my business card. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Her...  There were a few more opportunities over the year's but those stick out in my mind. And Oh yes, I still have those autographed item's.|`|c3tADklmaa	Lucky you.    It's harder to see an MLB player by being distracted outside a ballpark. I swear I saw Jayson Werth one time in the airport. Same thing with Dustin McGowan on Canada.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Nope, haven't ever met one outside of the ballpark or inside for that matter.|`|UoUaO52taa	Nobut my grandpa once met Sal Maglie at a gym.

I would have loved to know what that guy eats he has quite a temper.Yes i have in fact last month i went to Cracker Barrel i walked in, and as i was seated Marino Rivera was sitting at the next table i almost died i couldn't belive it i was SHOCKED he was eating a big $ss steak and baked potato also buffalo wings and a ton of other food i couldn't make out i was floored it was so unexpected.|`|mqdkcHDFaa	My dad saw Jon Daniels (the Rangers GM) at Central Market.   Lucky for him, I wasn't there.  If I was there I probably would have given him a piece of my mind, regarding our painful lack of pitching and the Michael Young move to third, among other things.    Edit:   Oh, and I've met former Red Sox and Ranger, Luis Ortiz.  He coaches kids from coach pitch to high school now, and my brother takes lessons from him occasionally.  I've actually talked to him ("Hi, Mr. Ortiz!"  "Hello..."  "I'm a big Rangers fan!"  "I see...").  He's totally nice and cool.  Plus, he's played with guys like Nolan Ryan and even said he'd try to get some autographs for us.  :)|`|jKOB7n35aa	I once met Julio Lugo at a Little League game. Some relative of his was on one of the teams, and word got out quickly that he would be there. My mom's friend who owns a liquor store met Larry Luchino when he came in for wine I think in 2005. He came complete with the 2004 World Series Ring and everything. My mom said she heard about it when she went to the store 30 minutes later.|`|AA11467290	I met Sammy Sosa at Peperoni's restaurant in Casa de Campo, La Romana, Dominican Republic.  We were eating dinner outside when he walked by and set down right next to us with an entourage of about 10 other people (his family I guess).  I got up and wished him a great season and he actually said "Thank you, sir" to me.  Couldn't believe he called me sir (as I have no such elitist status).  Was a little shocked that he was shorter than what I envisioned him to be, but he was STOCKY...the dude is pure muscle.  Anyway, this happened about 3 years ago, but I still remember it very vividly...I guess one of those "once in a lifetime brushes with greatness".    BTW, I also visited San Pedro de Macoris (about 30 miles west of La Romana), the birthplace of my all-time favorite baseball player, Julio Franco.|`|RW7qVMk5aa	I played baseball at wells park with dusty bakers son for 3 years and was on his son's team twice, met his dad a few times but i was like 12 so it was like...."Hi, :) "|`|ivbnPxSKaa	david wright, my dad knows him  arod once  and blake and denny doyle  and dale long|`|BQIyhMp6aa	Yes, more than once.|`|MUgs8tKoaa	I saw Jermaine Dye at the mall.

Never really said much to them except for "Hello" or "Excuse me" if they were blocking my way.    Not a baseball player, but I was on the same flight as former NY Giant Ron Dayne once.  So that's probably the most random place I've seen an athlete.
SM6qHDKeaa	i would rather see him compete with some other new guys in the middleweight division of the ufc, not the top guys yet. if he was successful, then i would like to see him against some of the higher ranked fighters|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Cung Le hasn't proven himself enough. He is exciting and obviously his skill is above average as he has defeated many opponents.  But his opponents are mostly unexperienced fighters, and has beens like Frank Shamrock.    Middleweight itself doesn't have many high level contender like welterweight does.    Be nice to see Cung Le fighting the ex-champ Rich Franklin before Anderson Silva.|`|S0N3BRecaa	At 185 He'd be fighting what, Anderson Silva? That'd be an awesome fight, i have to admit. However, i'm getting the impression that if he fought a good grappler, he'd lose. Mirko CroCop syndrome.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	he needs to fight more often. He is very exciting to watch. I don't think too many MMA guys can top him for that. But beating Frank Shamrock in a great fight just makes it that much more difficult. Plus the guy is concentrating on a movie right now. I think he actually has dreams of becoming the next Van Damme or something. He says that he would like a fight with Anderson Silva but not sure where his head is right now.        He needs to fight more often! Hopefully soon. Until then I don't think anybody can really say how great the guy is.|`|gBO908P6aa	He has won all 6 of his MMA fights and is a Strikeforce mid-weight champ.

After the credits Samoa Joe aired a promo with his back to the camera going, "Main Event Mafia...let me introduce you to....the real Samoa Joe." After which he faced the camera and had a tattoo of some kind of arrow on the left side of his face.     Overall the first hour of the show was pretty funny with the Mafia running things and they had more wrestling then promos which was good. The second half was a bit of a let down once 'order' was restored. Overall the show was pretty good.

cRqwANvlaa	I never disliked Mick Foley in the first place, but after reading some of his AMAZING books, they really made me like him that much more as not only a wrestler, but as a person. It is amazing how creative and unique the guy is and the way he tells all of his stories makes them all fun to read. It's tough to combine serious-toned stories from the past with a comedic side to it, but Mick Foley did it.    If or when Mick Foley ever leaves wrestling as a whole, I can really see him getting a long way as an author. It would be interesting to see him come up with his own original story that had nothing to do with wrestling to attract casual readers that have no knowledge of wrestling to read his books and spread the word, and then there are the wrestling fans that want to read his books because they recognize him from wrestling. Mick would really have the moolah piling up then.|`|32AEFhWhaa	But. but it was a book.

BZpF8nSsaa	as a fellow 49ers fan (and an avid one) i am alos a little dissaponited, but i trust singletary andf what he stands for. Singeltary is looking for and OC who has the same philoshipy as him (hard nose, kick *** football). And if singletary thinks this raye guy has it in him, i will back him....    MIke singletary took mike martz and opposed his views on him, so i think he can do the same in this position|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Yeah, I'm not stoked about Raye either. I wasn't happy that they were going after Linehan though. My theory is that Scott Linehan is scared to have people blaming him, so he chose a team that he could not possibly make any worse. This sucks. They get on track, Hill is doing alright, they'll have some cap room, they have a coach that unifies the team, and I have hope again. This makes me nervous and annoyed. Let's just see what they pick up off FA and the draft. Houshmanzadeh could still be available when FA opens. Receivers and Linemen on both sides should be the target.|`|TqXzRr8Aaa	Its the niners..

QTd8MVDjaa	If you're just starting out and just pushing around and stuff, I guess you could. Usually, the bearings on the cheap generic boards are really bad, so you might have to use it for a couple weeks until the the wheels start to roll better. If you find out you really like skateboarding after a while with the cheap board, save up and get a real skateboard at a skateboard shop.|`|wcReKCpLaa	i don't think so cuz i tried them but they are usually cheap and heavier so u would be better off will a decent skate board if one of your friends skate ask if you could borrow their board|`|rnV3jW1Qaa	Well it depends i got a board at target and when i rode it it turns by it self so did all the other boards and if you are going to get into sk8 boarding then get a good board but if your not don't waste you money. Sk8 boarding can be time consuming. And costly|`|SrUGmnALaa	NOoOOOOOooo  well.. you could of course  but if you are just gonna cruse around anyways then might as well buy a longboard or a crusier.. they roll so smoooooothhhhhhhhhhh  hahaha  no joke.. and they are extremely fun to ride and carve in  you could probably buy a CHEAPPPP one.. for maybe 75  but it is worth it.. trust me.. just think about it  because the ones at target will toss you over the front on every crack and bump|`|RwgxhGMeaa	My suggestion is... DONT DO IT. If you want to be a real skater, you need to learn on a real board. Target and Wal-Mart boards are crap. And yes, they are heavier, and the bearings and hardware suck. I'll try not to mention too much that everyone will make fun of you and pick on you until you get a real board.    So save your dollars until you can afford a good board. Talk to other skaters and maybe even try out their boards. Ask them about trucks and bearings and wheels and so on. Try to find out what set-up youll like and be comfortable with most, and fits your style of skating.    And when you do get your board, dont be afraid to fall, cause you will! Its just part of it. You just have to get back up and do it again.    I know you said you just want one to ride around, but I have a feeling you'll fall in love with it like I did (over 20 years ago), and will want to learn more.|`|xMSESsGQaa	I think Nick C gave a really good answer.

nRBC4E5saa	You mean Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters?  The Ultimate Fighting Championships is simply a promotional organization.  Like the NFL or the NBA.    They spend a lot of time with martial arts training.  The particular martial arts they focus on varies, but is usually a combination of boxing, Muay Thai (kickboxing from Thailand), wrestling, Brazilian Jiujitsu (a grappling art), and sometimes Judo.  When they are preparing for a fight, they spend six to eight hours in the gym.  They also do conditioning exercises, like push-ups, pull-ups, various abdominal exercises, sprints, swimming, some weight-lifting routines, and plyometric (jumping and bounding) exercises.|`|3KQRw8sPaa	ufc is crap|`|W7NHuTEkaa	every fighter/trainer has their own preferences I would think.

8b56nyfkaa	Well,  the game before the superbowl was amazing -   when rothlisburger escaped like 3 tackles and still got the ball of to his guy and then he escaped like 3 tackles -     i think it will be pretty hard to sack him.  but i dont really think it will make the outcome of the game different. i HOPE he gets sacked 5 times, but thats just cuz im a cards fan      GO CARDINALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Not if Kurt Warner also gets sacked 5 times.    Warner has a history of holding on to the ball too long, and fumbling when he gets hit, which landed him on the bench. Twice.    One of those times, he bounced around to three different teams before getting another chance to start.    Now, you might say he figured it out in Arizona, but I'd remind you that he got sacked 5 times by the Jets this season. Not exactly an elite defense like the Steelers, either.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I think you bet some money and are wishing, fantasizing, or both. This is one of the most far out questions I have ever read in this section. Enjoy the warm weather out there!    The Steelers could certainly lose if BR gets sacked five times. Any team likely would.|`|s7fUsMqoaa	I think they will lose anyway|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	Yes  Yes  The Cardinals offense is going to go all day against the Steelers defense.|`|rBC2YLdNaa	the steelers will still win.  they will shut down the cardinal o and win the game|`|nXvSpky6aa	Go Cards, NFC all the way!!!  Even more than a Cardinal win, I'm hoping for a great game.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	I am not convinced that the Cards can stop the run...I know the Steelers haven't had a good running game this season, but if Willie can get 3, 4, 5 yds at a time I think they will be able to take control of the game.    As for Ben being sacked 5 times...it's possible if he has to throw a lot...I still think the Steelers will prevail...but, of course, anything is possible...  ----------    did someone up there ^^ say that the Cards had 2 sacks this season?...wow...you were close...they had 31...  ----------    VVV....11 sacks and 11 INT's???...this isn't Madden...|`|tpPO7qehaa	YES,BECAUSE HE WILL FUMBLE THE BALL AND CARDS WILL GET IT.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Yeah, the Steelers OL isn't as strong as they'd like it to be.  I think if the Cardinals rush him and make him throw the ball quickly then the Steelers will have a lot of 3 and outs.  Also the Cardinals corners and safeties are half decent and if a ball gets tipped and winds up floating in the air then it is likely to get picked off.    Edit: Yeah I know he can be hard to find, and he also seems pretty tough to bring to the ground.  It'll be interesting either way.|`|AA12325046	Yeah if the Cardinals defense can sack him 5 times and disrupt their offense like that, sure they can win.|`|CA7O7Iowaa	No.  Defense wins championships.  The Steelers defense will put up beter stats than the Cardinals five sacks.|`|kjGaxBVVaa	ughhhhhhhhh ......... doesnt matter its about scoring , yes ben gets sacked and i hate the steelers , im a ravens fan but as much as it pains me to admit , the cardinals defence sucks , they have 2 sacks this season , which isnt great but i think fitzgerald and the underdogs will win against the team i hate the most steelers|`|XfX57xPgaa	the steelers are gonna lose weather he gets sacked or not. they stink! GO CARDINALS|`|JmYJJqJTaa	No because James Harrison will force 3 sacks, James Farrior with 3, LaMarr Woodley with 2, Troy Polamalu with 2, and Casey Hampton with 1.    Sacks-  Harrison- 3  Farrior- 3  Woodley- 2  Polamalu- 2  Hampton- 1    Ints.-  Polamalu- 3  Taylor- 3  McFadden- 2  Clark- 2  Harrison- 1|`|d7mgKCJ8aa	i stopped thinking|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Yeah it puts them in bad field position and makes Ben turn the ball over if he tries to force it under pressure. Same can be said with Warner. They have way more then 2 sacks judging how KC set the record for fewest with 10. I'm sure Berry alone has more then 2 sacks.|`|Gy1YkHoeaa	No Troy Polamalu will score at least 2 defensive touchdowns. The Steelers will win!!!|`|9kLiiDzVaa	yes,
DnFoaKPqaa	Though I cannot give a price without knowing the years or brand, I can tell you that if they are 16 years old, there is a good chance that they are not worth "too much". Cards from the late 80s and early 90s were radically overproduced and it hurt the market for them considerably. However, if you have a pristine Derek Jeter rookie, or some other key rookie cards, then your collection would definitely be looking into. You can try Beckett.com for a month and put all of your cards on there to get a price.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	My rival is rite...for once|`|h5Jq2LpXaa	I have a giant Baseball Card Price Guide if you can give me the exact years i can give you a price on your baseball cards. Email me at delcherz@comcast.net|`|EUdHcGW1aa	Check ebay, beckett or a card dealer. Is it a Topps set? That also could be a factor.|`|dKh3vqq9aa	i bought a nolan ryan for 3 dollars but don't be discouraged. i'll buy them for more.|`|pQxuivYaaa	Others have said it, but I'll reiterate. 16 years ago is 1993 (so the cards are probably 1992-1994). With 792 cards, you might have the complete set of Topps, or then again you might not. The whole set is worth around $15-20 but you would be lucky to get around $5. Cards back then were just really overproduced.|`|tvy8qFKCaa	There's no way for us to know, you've given us nothing. We need a year, and a company. It sounds like a set, from the early 90s or late 80s, which were all overproduced, you could get about 5 bucks, check Ebay for full sets from that period and you'll see no one wants them because they're overproduced.      You're going to have some buffoons tell you anywhere between $40 and 5000 but it's not true. You can verify this yourself by simply checking Ebay.
AA11729094	Completely different ammo, the 38 from the manila conflict was 38 Long Colt, 38 Special is what your 10-6 is chambered for, is more powerful. The 38 Long Colt was underpowered from it's beginning, the advent of 45acp is directly tied to the stopping power failure of the old 38LC.    Todays modern 38 Special is slightly hotter than 9mm with comparable bullet weights. Those who say 38 special is ineffective as a defensive round know NOT what they say.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	ok, every cartridge from those times have either been loaded with better powders or better bullets, so all the cartridges are better then when they were first produced, with that being said, yes, the .38 cal would be better now then all of the times you said there.  cartridge development is continuously evolving to make better, more powerful, faster, penetrating ammo.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Modern ammunition has one major advantage, it is bullet design and construction.  Jacket bullets can be pushed faster than lead.  Modern hollow points can work at a wide range of velocities and still open as designed.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Advances in technology, both in ammunition and the arms themselves, will of course produce better weapons.     Modern powders are stronger (and more stable!), and frames are tougher to take the higher pressures.|`|vQUb2aT1aa	The .38 special is definitely more reliable than it's predecessors.  With the birth of +P ammo, you can achieve power close to the 9mm.  I myself choose the Smith & Wesson model 642 for my primary concealed carry piece (ammo of choice is Magtech Guardian Gold 125gr JHP +P).  The round is reliable and accurate enough to suit me, and as a LEO I have high standards for my weapons.  To put it simply I will stand by the .38 special's ability in the following manner:  if I ever have to use my smith in a defense situation and I "bite the bullet", then I will stand at the pearley gates and say that I only lost because I wasn't the better gun.|`|cb94f6a414e037c2e4b7b34c414221e3aa	You do your job with bullet placement and the bullet will do its job.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Don't blame the .38 S&W Special for the failures in the Moro Insurrection!    The >38 S&W Special was not even invented at the time.    The cartridge blamed for failure was the .38 Colt, which used 150 grain Lead Round nosed Bullet at 770 fps, where as the .38 S&W Special launched the same bullet at 890 fps.    But don't swallow those old tails of Moro Juramentados dropping like rocks when hit in the toe with a .45 bullet.  Those fellows were stoned to the gills and had their arms and legs wrapped with compression bandages to help lessen bleeding from wounds to the limbs.  Some of those fellows managed to absorb a whole magazine full of .30 caliber bullets from a Krag and still split the shooter's head to the teeth.    But yes, some .38 S&W Special loads are much more effective.  Now days we have jacketed hollow points, semi-wadcutters, swagged lead hollow-points, +P, and +P+ loadings that boost the power of the .38 Special to just a little short of the .357 Magnum.    Doc|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	I don't know about those days but I've never had any problems with my .38. I don't buy the cheapest ammo but it is usually one of the cheaper ones.
1FGWFcljaa	you sound like you are doing really good. keep it up. love to see more girls taking the sport seriously!    make sure you work on your style. the goal is to make even hard things look easy.     also, learn how to go really fast in varied terrains: powder, ice, chunky stuff, trees, etc. when you can ride comfortably in all kinds of conditions, it makes you are well rounded rider.    jump off everything you find along the runs. pop ollies everywhere. this is what makes you are really good rider. and that last advice comes from mark frank montoya (one of the best pro riders out there), not me :-)|`|UpPWXRK4aa	You will probably be awesome when you get older, you are off to a very good start. You are lucky, I wish I started at your age. Congrats and kick some butt girl|`|QTd8MVDjaa	You're alright I guess. Better than a lot of people. You're doing pretty good for how long you've been snowboarding. Keep it up!|`|jTaW3goeaa	You sound decent from your discription, but I'd have to see you ride.  Also don't think that because you are good in the park you are better then other riders.  I'm not the best when it comes to the park but I can take anybody when it comes to free riding, I've gotten lessons from a guy that used to coach snowboard racers.  Having advanced free riding abilities is just as important as being able to do things in the park. I see a lot of people in the park that can do basic tricks yet if you take them down the double diamonds and watch them get down the hill, they can't ride for crap.  But it sounds like you're doing pretty good for just starting|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	well, yeah, for the park. but as the other dude put it, i've never seen you snowboard, so i can't tell. :/ sorry. and sometimes, people are awesome in the park, but they can't shred for crap.    personally, i'm not a park person because i have to play piano, and i can't risk breaking anything right now. bummer huh.     i wish i started snowboarding earlier so i could get it down quicker.     well, have fun :]
OfNTLq3Qaa	At least Matt has technical skills. Jeff just throws himself through a table. I could get a monkey to do that.

eIOFtaz6aa	Dick Trickle my long time hero and wisconsin winnings driver. the guy is a god in wisconsin. well Mr.Trickle has had some rough times over the last 2 years. last year Trickle had open heard surgery but even at the age of 68 Mr. Trickle still talks about racing and once in awhile comes back to wisconsin to race. Trickle is the winnings Short track Driver of all time and has won over 1,200 features races 2 Busch/Nationwide races. has 7 ARTGO Championships and 9 years of racing in the ARTGO 2 ASA championships|`|BGz0xdKyaa	I don't know whatever happened to Dick Trickle, but I always thought he should drive the Viagra Car. lol|`|mc9M9kvsaa	he got some penicillin|`|OnXX13yCaa	i believe that he is still living in the denver nc area. last i heard i think he had a bout with prostate cancer but was doing fine.|`|gUtNtO9Kaa	lmao wow. idk about the guy, but man thats a funny name. i would hate my parents|`|XAhFBgIfaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Trickl...|`|AA10431326	I agree, I have liked and respected Dick Trickle for years, have seen him race and he is a very nice person, too boot.
54lT7R6uaa	first off, glad your a falcon's fan!! they're the best.    ok, you need to practice outside of practice and running a mile almost everytime you run is your best route. that way, when you only have to run a fourth of that, it doesn't seem so bad. (don't complain in your head, cause we run 10 miles in cross country so our 3 miles races seem really short)    when running the mile, i tell new runners to not walk at all. it will just make building stamina harder. running is almost all mental. so by walking you told your body to give up. when you feel like walking, try to shuffle aka baby jog aka run as slow as you can without breaking into a walk. this will tell your body that quitting is not an option. once you can run the mile without walking at a constant speed, then start working on getting faster.    running about 70% of your full out sprint is a good place to start for the first 100-200. after that, gradually drop down to 60% and keep that pace until the last lap. then gradually speed up until you get to the end. by then you should be at a full out sprint.    good luck!!    p.s. ipods help, and drink plenty of water!!|`|KcloaW4vaa	No offense intended, but you need to simply lose some weight along with increasing your stamina. Im not saying you overweight or anything but you need to be a reasonable weight before being able to accomplish stamina. To obtain stamina, though, you need to maintain a great diet so they go together.     What you do is do reptitions of running everyday....  You run at your own pace the first couple of days (a 3 mile run!)  Then each interval of a few days, you try to go a few seconds faster. This is like the only way to do it, practiceing over and over....  So keep running and running along with having a good diet and youll be able to become faster as well as have stamina for these longer distance running for tack.   BTW- how far did you run anyway? 1 lap?   Heres a goal for you for the next season of football.  Be able to do one 400m (a lap around the track) around the track in one minute!!!!!!! This is a great motivational set for you and will make you want to get faster and have stamina all the way through.    Never give up and always try your best or you wont succeed.|`|AyoxEkRTaa	do distnace runs at a good breathing pace. try running upright with your hips pushing out. keep good form and the only way to get endurance is to run more often. your heart will eventually get stronger and your lungs will too, hence, being able to pump more blood and oxygen to your muscles. good luck!|`|j8q1AYmaaa	something simple just practice on your own time everyday and eventually you will not give out as fast|`|pJ2Ew8qbaa	Hello,  I will help you with this a bit. So, you want to have more stamina?  For stamina, i think you should try to run a long distance which you decides, then the next day you increase the distance 10% more than yesterday. Hard to breathe is one more thing that make your times goes down, control your breathing, try 1-2 Breathing, 1 is breathe in while stepping left, then 2 is breathe out step right.. control it.. remember breathe in using nose, breathe out using mouth. I think your leg must have more muscles.. Try lifting weights for your leg such as Leg curl ( which is not recommended by me, use money ). You can run a long distance everyday.. take a day or two for rest in a week.  Dont push yourself harder, remember follow what your body say, if body say Go! Then you Go! If No, means No!    Hope I Helped You Enough.. Thank You.|`|Cv1FhPJmaa	dude just think bout how you could be the coaches favee. if you rann the time limit he gives you oh and just think bout how you could be done if you just runn hard just remember that runnin is 90% mental so that means you could be a seriously big boy and your a lineman you prolly got some extra junk whitch thats good i mean to me thats totally hot look at jason witten hottie n e ways just kno you can do it and you will do it   xoxo       brooke loves you
YsUFozBDaa	well um for starters drink plenty of water first and eat plenty of carbs and for me when we jog during practice it helps that i eat a bar of chocolate before the jogs and sprints. Well i really think the only way to improve stamina is by constantly practicing and jogging everyday but you must remember to always push your limit and never ever give up.i sware it is really hard specially when it hurts just below your chest or the diaphragm but it will get better although the first month or two will be torture it will be worth it when you see yourself not so much as struggling to complete your training...ohh and also try inhaling and exhaling through your nose only only exhale through your mouth when you are really really really tired. and las get pleny of sleep before training it helps:)|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	GO FALCONS!|`|PlhUh1Byaa	all you can do is run a lot. i can see you are no usain bolt|`|kjG2nyvBaa	when u start to feel like u cant go on hold ur breath and keep running den u feel refreshed i guess|`|eOmQbAeNaa	You can't. You have bronchial asthma and you're grossly over weight.|`|iYosSWUCaa	The best way to build stamina for running is more running.
Cb5N6UaQaa	You have to be very careful with your pivot is easy to get confused doing that. But no. no travel there.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	dont listen to them. There was no travel. He kept his pivot foot down and took a step to the basket for the lay up. 2 steps can be taken safely. That was obviously safe|`|n6514FLVaa	nope thats called skillz!|`|dDhTMacAaa	That is a travel in so many ways.    But it's an incredible move and I will try it.|`|onkUcy19aa	That is a travel. Oh, sucks!|`|LGLnItBcaa	his right foot stayd planted until he jumped to score. so no, its not a travel.|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	no that is not a travel. i do that same move and all those retard refs call it a travel. but it is not. if you watch nba games you see that up and under move a lot.watch this MJ video, (only one i could find) before he gets blocked he does the up and under move, kinda like kobe, and it is not a travel. that move is a great one, and completely legal. some people say it is traveling because he took "an extra step", it is not a travel.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhqMuo12e...|`|uxregJ0faa	His pivot never moved no travel. He jumped after the pump fake.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Kobe never travels.|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	depends maybe ure pivot foor moved(kobe's did) and the other guy caught it... u have to do that move quickly so that ure not gonna get caught...|`|vq4DYBGgaa	actually it was a travel|`|lMDy8W0Raa	No. Learn to do it right,or  learn from Ledork and show everyone what a real travel is.|`|reIMLCKkaa	excellent move, no travel|`|Xbid2OG8aa	you guys are stupid   he made his jump stop  slid his pivot foot a little  then took a step  definate travel

Both were coaches on the Steelers when they won Super Bowl XL.  And Larry Fitzgerald graduated from my alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh.  With all these ties it is hard to not want the Cardinals to win.  Besides the Steelers have 5 Super Bowls, and the Cardinals have zero.  Go Cardinals!  But I will be wearing my Polamalu jersey.
y9kic67Kaa	yes you definitely should get track spikes. be sure to get ones specific for your events. the maxcats by nike would be a good choice|`|whGkbN7Iaa	hell no theyll slow u down and theyl hurt the arches in your feet|`|AyoxEkRTaa	you should get spikes for the races. you should oonly use spikes for races and doing some last minute runs threw's b4 the race. never train in them bc you'll get hurt. buy good running sneakers to practice in. tey wiegh a lot more so you'll fly with spikes. go to eastbay.com for teh spikes. and any sporting goods store will have a descent pair of running shoes to practice in.|`|LEWHQtNTaa	No cleats are for soccer... Just get some regular nike's or adidas or something|`|Aky5JKQEaa	i like the adidas they are very lite weight let u dont have any shoes on wich is very good for runners.|`|ZdApm2hLaa	Spiked track shoes are made for rubber tracks. If your track is made out of pavement, the spikes might slip some. You can remove the metal spikes though.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Not spikes, but a good pair of running shoes.|`|y2CzXNTLaa	If your running on a rubber track get sprinting spikes as all these events are sprints. All sprinting spikes don't have much of a sole so you have to be committed to the 100m, 200m and 400m as spikes without much of a sole are useless for anything other than sprinting.|`|ViZyM2AUaa	I personally don't use spikes (because I'm terrible...) but if you are a decent runner, get spikes. They DO help you improve your times.     I personally run track with just running shoes.....

60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	I played with Asics for about a year before switching to Mizunos in the middle of school season last fall, and boy, was that a good idea! The Asics were pretty good shoes, but I had trouble getting them to grip the floor. I'd rub water into the bottom of the shoes, but they'd stick for only a short while before sliding around again. Then I went to tournament one weekend, and after nine hours of playing, my Asics started to rip at the seams. So the following week, on recommendation by most of the girls on the team, I tried out Mizunos. I have the Wave Spike 11's and just recently got the Wave Lightning 4's and I LOVE them! Not only are they great shoes, but they look pretty nice too, and the shoe gives you extra height (due to past injury, my podiatrist wanted me using heel inserts with all my shoes, but after looking at my Mizunos, she okayed for me to use them without the inserts).|`|MWYVwNwcaa	I love the sport too and swear by my sneakers so much that I bought a few pairs in case they ever stopped making them! I would go with the Adidas Womens Vuelo ClimaCool Volleyball Shoes. They come in all different cool colors and are super comfortable.  Depending were you buy them from they range from $40-65. Here's a link...    http://shop.volleyball.com/SKU/020104/ad...      Hope this helped!|`|7TMZhYlQaa	currently i have ascics and they are great and very durable (i have had them for a year and they held up fine except for the shoelaces which needed to be replaced once)  but know i am getting a new pair for the new club season and i am thinking about getting mizuno lightning 4( i think that's the model) because i have heard that they are also wonderful shoes|`|DFUN42S9aa	mizuno|`|68fmDJqIaa	I love Asics.|`|hmXwGhBLaa	I wear converse during my volleyball games. they are comfortable and are easy to run around in.|`|Uuq0a7tNaa	Well, the leading brands in volley ball shoes are currently Mizuno and Asics. These shoes are specially made for the sport come in every colour imaginable and provide the best protection and comfort, as well as much more. However yes, these brands are expensive (ranging 100-200$) and some times difficult to find. So my basic reccomendations are something light weight gel/gum bottems (which heat much more quickly on a gym floor) shoes with low ankle structure, (dont buy shoes for ankle support buy ankle braces !) and stay away from "most" running shoes and basket ball  shoes as these sometimes cause injurys and are not specially made for the sport. Some more afforadble choices are addidas court, and nike court also found to be fairly reliable. Good luck hope this helps :)|`|V68UttIMaa	First i had Asics Hummer, than i bought Asics Tactic, after that i was wearing Asics Sensei, now i'm practising with Asics Rocket (Red), so you must got it already, I reccomend Asics :)|`|qkEPaCQSaa	I'd totally go with asics. There super comfortable, and breath easily. But if your interested in buying some try them on before you buy because there sizes tend to be kind of small.  Hope i helped:)
cRqwANvlaa	Matt Hardy. I know that Edge has been the top heel in WWE for a long time now, but the way Matt turned on Jeff was just wrong. If you remember when Edge originally made his heel turn in 2005, it was a soft turn (Turning heel over an extended period of time) and the only reason was because of the hunger for power and greed.    But the way Matt turned was just cruel, and it was on his own family. His own brother. Just because of jealousy because Jeff was getting the spotlight. And all Matt would have had to ask was ask for a friendly title shot with Jeff, and you know that Jeff would have gladly accepted, but Matt decided to turn on his brother, and that is what brings him down in everybody's book.    But look at what Edge has done. He has the "Ultimate Opporotunist" moniker for a reason. Look how many times he has came in at the last minute and simply beat the champion without even breaking a sweat after they just got out of a grueling title match and wins their title without even caring. Survivor Series 2008 when he beat HHH after HHH had just won his title defense, Smackdown a couple years ago when he stole Mr Kennedy's Money in the Bank title shot and used it to beat Undertaker for the World title. And probably the most unthinkable and cheap one, at New Year's Revolution 2006 where he cashed in his MITB title shot and used it to beat Cena for the title, right after he had been bloodied and brutalized after winning the Elimination Chamber.    So basically they are both great heels in their own right-    Matt turned on family simply out of jealousy AND cost his brother his most prized possession.    Edge is hated by the people becuase of the way he does business- coming in and taking the cheap way out, knowing there is nothing anyone can do about it.|`|8Try9VSqaa	matt hardy|`|KIOR56r6aa	Edge|`|E7TkNO00aa	I would say Edge. He skrews everyone up if they let him. Someone should shut him up as well as Matt Hardy. I hope he kicks Matt's behind soon.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Edge, I mean look at what he's done with Lita and the Hardy's. What he did to Kane. Edge is just a great heel. I never liked him as a face but I do like him as a heel.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	I bet you that most people who answered this don't even know what "despicable" means, haha...(like myself).|`|41WXZPnCaa	Edge      Well Basic Cuz He Always Is On Patethic Storylines|`|Gr7My8FTaa	jeff hardy because he sucks|`|W8SgRKo7aa	Matt Hardy, because he turned on his brother...|`|eX7An0AKaa	Edge. I have said it time and time again Edge is in my opinion one of the best heels ever.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Edge,I mean people LOVE to HATE him...one of the best heels ever|`|AA11044288	matt hardy v.2 lets hope matt facts don't make a comeback|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Edge. He's just so good at being a jerk,you cant help but to hate him.  (Unless you're an Edgehead)|`|Mr2lcNR2aa	Edge, not even close. Think of what he does to everyone. He has cost more than 1 person his belt. He is a hypocrite. Undertaker was champion and when he won money in the bank and beat Undertaker when he was bleeding and then CM Punk beat him when he was hurt and everyone called Punk a fluke. Come on better questions|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Edge!!!!!!!!
dDhTMacAaa	If they were healthy they would have been good.    Why? Because they would have had their playmaking point guard surrounded by shooters and would be running their up-tempo offense every game.    But, Ellis got hurt, they traded a stud shooting big man for their 15th Shooting Guard, and obviously they no longer have Baron Davis or Jason Richardson, players that excelled in "Nellie Ball."    as for this season's seed: I'll say  10 at best.    And if they were healthy,  9 at best. They have talent but the West is packed!    let's see what they can do tonight against N'Oleans on ESPN.    They need to rebuild, and Nelson and possible GM Chris Mullins (I believe) could be gone next season.|`|KOfwamdbaa	They would be better maybe they could win 45 games but as you can see the west is tough. I think they would be in contention for the west 8th spot.|`|KezaxDNnaa	Why are Warrior fans always so delusional?|`|XrCc85kNaa	I hate hypothetical questions....  It is not like we know for real...|`|2dgVkcVAaa	8th|`|Xbid2OG8aa	10th cuz they are good but the west is pretty good
Tsv6zyawaa	1)Yes, i think he will know edge,he'll probably be behind all the bad stunts that happened to Jeff.  2)I wish Cena cursed and dissed and was the funny rapper dude again.  3)What?  4)He beat them cuz wwe scripted it.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	1.  Since pretty much everybody knows about Edge and Christian's tag team and the titles they won together, it would be ridiculous for the WWE to try to pretend it never happened.  They will definitely know each other.  RAW has a bigger roster of big-names, so I think Christian would be put on Smackdown.    2.  I believe Cena was on The Rock about him doing movies INSTEAD of being in the WWE.  Since "going Hollywood" The Rock has publicly stated that he wants nothing to do with wrestling or the WWE any more.  Cena, along with a few others, do movies while continuing their wrestling careers.  The Rock basically turned his back on the WWE and the fans.  Cena was on The Rock for forgetting where he came from, where he got famous, and who made him famous.    3.  I'm not sure what TNA is hoping to accomplish with the Suicide character.  It seems to be more a plug for the TNA video game (in which Suicide is a character) than to introduce a new wrestler to the roster.  It's also odd that Helms returned to a decent fanfare but hasn't been seen on TV in a couple of weeks.  Perhaps Helms' TV segments were sacrificed to have more time for the Jeff Hardy/Matt Hardy/Edge saga?    4.  Yeah, Khali screwed up The Pedigree.  But despite that they still finished the match as planned.  Khali in the Elimination Chamber would have been disastrous.  Triple H is a veteran of the Chamber and will obviously be in this year's.  Kozlov will probably qualify next week or the week after.|`|ZK3x8pbBaa	Chirstian will know him.  And will DEFINITELY be on SD.    Yes he did.   But hes not a hypocrite.  Cena does movies and is still in WWE.  Rock left WWE for Hollywood.   Big Difference.  Kinda like what Ken is doing.  Hes in a movie, but at the same time, hes still a wrestler.|`|4aPfLJVMaa	1. same brand  2.dunno  3. dude under mask of suicide (kaz) got injured, but now its christopher daniels taking over until kaz is good.  4. lol valandor?|`|E7smxUOZaa	4. whos valandor??? i watched that match and im pretty sure its VLADIMIR.

He does rap an his good at it, an his a good actor its up 2 him what he does, maybe his changed his views on 'dropping the wwe' but cena ain't 'dropped wwe' his still here.  3.

wp2mIqTcaa	practice you toss and swing, but when you swing, catch it where you would hit it.     go outside and find a side of the house with not a lot on it and take an older worn-out ball and serve to that side.     do push-ups; they give you more arm strength to serve the ball harder and farther|`|XdBbAHbbaa	only have a few answers to all of your questions:    1. for tossing, throw it with a strait arm, right above your head, then swing  2. since your house is brick, practice by hitting it against the side-it's what I do all the time!|`|Uuq0a7tNaa	Practice in serving is probably the best way to strengthen the service arm. Practice and practice Allot, as for your serve just making it over, its not always a bad thing either. And although my guess is that you're looking for power in your serve, perhaps a better option would be technique first power later. For example practice a floater serve or maybe even a jump serve. Good luck :) happy playing.|`|THRzWjCyaa	UMMM...  i am  also a young volleyball player.  I am even worst than you, i keep serving INTO the net  all i do is to practice doing push-up at home  about 10 per day  if u can do more  then do it until your muscle is shaking  that's the best way to get more power on your arm    on tossing    practice tossing the ball the same height above you every time  if your tossing is not in the same zone above you , you will hit different part of the ball every time  if you hit the bottom of the ball, it will go all the way up then land before it even past the net.   if you hit the top, it go stright to the net.    Hope it help

Womens: S. Williams vs. Safina          I'm routing for Safina but most probably it'd be Serena winning in straight sets. She's playing very well.|`|mhgMQBo6aa	i think its too far away to make a prediction because they still have the whole season ahead of them...someone could get hurt or something   like what happened with novak djokovic this year in the aussie open...he was the defending champ but retired during his match in the quarterfinals against andy roddick...I didnt expect that at all  Also, based on the aussie open, Verdasco and Juan Martin del Potro seem to be up and coming hard court opponents.  I wouldnt count them out of the semis and final of the US Open this year.      On the women's front, Serena Williams and Dinara Safina will probably be the front runners.  I also wouldnt rule out that australian whos name escapes me (Dokic, i think?) anyhoo, everyone still has a lot of time.

The Wimbledon final was number 1 v 2 in the world, 5 sets at the home of tennis and Nadal winning with just enough light left in the day.    last night was a game for the ages, but i wouldnt call it the best ever.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	prob the best i ahe seen, i only saw up to 4th set thpugh, other than that ist was sooooo good, go rafa|`|MuzBDfawaa	i think it was one of the best !...... i was cheering for verdasco hoping he's gonna win but there's always next time for him. HE IS A MAN TO WATCH!  He will get his Grand Slam very soon... trust me.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	Absolutely it was one of the most magnificent matches I've ever seen and was notable not only for the tight scoreline but for the high standard of play throughout.  There was very little to choose between the two of them and it is a testament to Verdasco's new found commitment to fitness as well as his mentoring from Gil Reyes, Andre Agassi's former trainer.  Verdasco is the surprise of the tournament and the fact that he took out Murray, Tsonga, and almost Nadal is nothing short of amazing given his dismal slam results in the past. Absolutely incredible match that I stayed up all night to watch.  BTW, if anyone can recover from something like that to beat Federer, Nadal can!|`|3P2YS7KJaa	it was a good match but it wasnt one of the best mostly because it had no hype and it was a semi final if this was the final between federer and nadal and this score happend it would be talked for years     no hype because verdasco was a suprise|`|JoSl67nIaa	I don't think it was the BEST ever match, but it was definitely amazing.   Honestly, I thought Nadal would beat Verdasco in straight sets, so the result and high quality of play was very unexpected.   I first wanted to Verdasco to win, thinking it'd be an easier competition for Roger, but then of course he was almost just as good as Nadal.   As much faith as I have in Roger, I'm quite nervous for him. Hoping Roger will win the final. =)|`|9zX8FIrGaa	I don't know, but it was absolutely a good match! :)..|`|mhgMQBo6aa	I think that it truly was an amazing match...definitely a milestone for Verdasco and probably a memorable one for Nadal.    I thought Verdasco played so well against Nadal and I was really impressed with most of their points.   I think the final score says it all really|`|gWLhIoIiaa	nah there were much more exciting from 80's and 90's|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yeah it wax|`|gCGbbIMcaa	yeah it was one of the best matches ive ever seen. amazing and nerve racking.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Yes, definitely one of the best mate. But I have seen better. The last 2 years' Wimbledon finals were easily better than this.    Last night's match was of really high intensity. Neither player refused to give up. Verdasco was amazing with his 95 winners but Nadal won the match with his great defensive play.    Anyway, I hope it will be good contest on Sunday. I will be rooting for Federer as always. Hope Roger can keep doing what he has done for last 2 matches....absolutely magical. Please dont crucify me if you are a Nadal fan.

My recommendation would be to look around at several martial arts places and find one that you really like. Here are some things to look out for in a martial arts school.      1. Look for someone who is a good teacher. When he/she is teaching, they should be in complete control of the class. They shouldn't have to yell often. If he/she does then you will not want to learn from them. however, they shouldn't let people just walk over them.    2. Depending on what you want out of the school, ask whether he runs a mostly sporting school or a more traditional one, or whether he runs a school geared toward self-defense.    3. Ask how many belts they have. If they have more than ten belts, ask if they have a testing fee. If yes, be wary. Also, beware if they have things like "camo belt" and "ninja belt." yes, I have seen a school like this.    4. look at the rank of the teacher although this isn't necessary so much. Joe Lewis was only a second degree until four other grandmasters cornered him and forced him to take a tenth degree. and he was a world champion!    5. Check out the facility. see if there is proper safety equipment such as a mat and also see if sparring gear is used.    6. be careful of those who use trophies as selling points.    7. Avoid those who try to sell you their service. the best teachers will make you want to train with them just by their presence and charisma, not by haggling for hours.    8. remember, the true leader is not who has the most students, but who makes the most leaders. Watch his students for a while- make note of what shape they are in and how they interact with each other.    9. more expensive doesn't mean higher quality.    10. see if they allow you to take a trial period (usual is one or two weeks) before signing a contract. This way you can see what the classes are like and find out if martial arts are for you.    11. talk to the students. Make sure that theyre respectful, and ask what they think about the school. If its a good school, someone may come up and greet you as soon as you come in. this is a good sign.    16. Ask how long has the head instructor has worked at the school.    Lastly, congratulations on taking the beginning steps to martial arts. Less than 2% of people in the world are martial artists, so you're about to enter an elite group. Learn all that you can, practice with dedication, and may all your goals be reached.|`|cILeS32iaa	I think first you have to find out what martial art school is near you.    We might be able to give suggestions but I don't think you might be able to find some martial art style near you.     How old are you right now and do you exercise a lot? Some form of martial art is pretty hard to learn with you needing to make sure you have the flexibility and all that.    Like one above poster said it really depends on what you like like grappling, kickboxing and the likes.    I recommend Wing Chun since their focus in combat is pretty good.      http://wingchunmartialartkungfu.blogspot...|`|5bzJUmh4aa	I typed your question into the "search for questions" box and got 21,348 results.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	depends on why you want to do it.

I love watching female MMA matches... most of the time they are more intense than male fights. As far as a discipline to study, usually MMA fighters train in more than one martial arts style and often blend multiple disciplines into their own. One of the best female fighters is Gina Carano, she is predominately a Muay Thai style fighter combining Boxing and Kick Boxing techniques as well. I would suggest trying to find a Muay Thai dojo near you and start training as much as you can, you may be able to find some good sparring partners there as well (once your at that level). Basically train hard....train often and follow your dream...I hope to see you in the ring one day...Good luck    dP has provided an excellent answer also.|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	Find an MMA gym they are all over the place now. The three key ingridents to becoming a good MMA fighter is having knowledge in striking, clinching/ take downs, and ground fighting.    Some commonly seen arts(but not a complete list) are    striking: boxing, muay thai, kickboxing, various forms of karate like kyokushin karate, san shou.    clinch/takedowns: judo, wrestling, muay thai(strikes in the clinch), san shou  to a lesser degree: brazilian jiujitsu    ground fighting: brazilian jiujitsu, sambo  to a lesser degree: judo, wrestling    Some of the styles overlap such as Judo tends to have a heavy focus on takedowns however they do learn to fight on the ground though not as intensively focused as brazilian jiujitsu. While brazilian jiujitsu you'll focus on ground fighting with some takedowns though not as intensive as judo.    Most MMA gyms are going to offer: boxing/muay thai for striking, aspects of wrestling and judo for takedowns, and brazilian jiujitsu for ground fighting. Though this is most common you can take a different route if you want.    The beauty of MMA is that you use any styles you want and make it a part of your fighting style based on what you like to do. If you want to use punching aspects of wing chun go for it, or kicking techniques of taekwondo do it. Do what you feel comfortable doing, but it is also important to train realistically in a manner that is direct and to the point against a resisting opponent.    Home strength training exercises can be anything from various push ups and sit ups, to chin ups, lunges, calf raises box jumps etc...    Female MMA fighters are cool. Since I am into martial arts I think it is kinda hot(Gina Carano). Well as long as they are decently attractive in the first place.
ttbho89Vaa	well it takes about 10-15 minutes but sometimes at my rink there is a line of skates and it takes like 30-1 hour! so i would just go there and ask the guy or girl how long it will take.usually after my practice(not every practice) i go to the pro-shop and ask them to sharpen them and they keep them there until the next week.|`|eXvwU3yCaa	only  ten - thirty minutes|`|cj41sj6Eaa	I figure skate, and it really depends on the size on the skate. Also, it depends if the sharpener is there or not. If he/she is, then it should take no longer then 20 minutes.|`|mzTJarucaa	Mine usually takes 15minutes! Besides the availability of the sharpener and the man who sharpens your blades, you also consider the condition of your blade. If it's really blunt, it could take longer than 15min.

D2CC2t0kaa	Ok i'll do it:    If you love the game alot and really have dedication for it, then yes, you should play Jv as a Junior. If you work hard maybe you will get moved up to Varsity      It is common to see Jv Juniors. My school has 7 on the Jv and 4 on the Varsity. The 7 arent good enough to make Varsity tho so they deserve it. Just play and you never know, you could get moved up to Varsity if the coach is impressed. Take a shot at it and see how it goes. And ignore anyone who makes fun of you b/c i garuntee there will be some teases about it. But if you love the game it shouldnt matter.    Good luck|`|LGLnItBcaa	well as long as yor on the team then you still got a chance to prove that your good enough to play for a varsity spot... well JV doesn't necessarily mean that its only for 10th graders; it's really for the players who didnt qualify for the varsity team and/or haven't played for the team their first two years. But 10th graders usually make the team therefore they can prepare for varsity next year...|`|Xbid2OG8aa	i think its weird unless you are just awful
XZTwrn2Qaa	DO IT! I PLAYED ON JV AS A JUNIOR AND I MESSED THOSE LITTLE KIDS UP.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	My sophomore year, we had two juniors on our JV team.  One was an OL, the other was a WR.  The coach decided they should play JV because there was too much senior depth at their positions.  It was actually kinda cool, cause they got to actually see the field, while giving us a heads up as to what Varsity would be like.    It might be uncommon, but I would enjoy it.  It'll definitely give you a learning curve, and make you more prepared for your senior year.  As the "elder statesman", this will give you a good opportunity to learn or refine your leadership skills, without getting pummeled day in and day out while not getting any real game experience.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	Since you don't have any previous HS FB experience it would not be that weird for you to try out for the JV team. You have to start some where, and who knows, if you are especially gifted you may make the varsity team. When I played HS FB, there were a couple juniors who dressed and played JV and varsity both, though they didn't see much field time as varsity players.|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	Play JV football.  Yes  Uncommon  20|`|4wcMrNijaa	Playing JV is nothing to be ashamed of. All it would do is make you better for your senior year. About half the juniors in my school were on JV. It is not whether or not you are good, it is whether or not there is a senior in your position. There are very few softmores who play Varsity. Playing against other peole who are stronger and more athletic will make it harder for you to become better as a player. Considering you didn't play freshman or softmore year, you should probably play JV.

The Cardinals would be an interesting proposition, but they already have a number of good outfielders.    Otherwise, the Mets do present an interesting scenario.

BnetTGCkaa	What kind of camping are you doing?  Point to point backpacking or car camping or cabin camping or serious climbing?  Your best bet is to think of equipment groups: Sleeping, Eating, Shelter, Clothing, Toiletries, and Navigation come immediately to mind.    Buy a box of gallon zip-lock bags and divide your gear into groups that will be used together.  For instance, I put underwear and socks into a single bag, then pull out a new bag each night.  My mess kit goes in another bag.  My Toiletries go together (although my TP and trowel get a separate bag, since I keep them in an outer pocket).    Who are you going with and what are they bringing?  There is a lot of stuff that you don't need to duplicate, like tent and cooking gear.  Also, if you are going with someone who has gone before, they will know the weather and terrain.  Talk to them.    Don't go alone your first time.  If you don't know anyone, talk to your local outdoor shop.  Many areas have clubs where you can meet potential companions for a trip.    Minimum, IMHO, is a good pair of well broken-in boots, matches and tinder, a good sleeping bag, a sleeping pad, two days worth of weather appropriate clothing, one more days worth of underwear than you intend to use, map and compass, poncho or other foul weather gear, first aid kit, and some sort of soft sided bag or back pack to carry it all.    If you want more detail, try http://backpacker.com/checklists.  They have checklists for just about any type of outdoor experience.    Last suggestion: If you are going in any kind of cool or cold weather, stay away from cotton clothing.  You will get wet and cotton takes forever to dry.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	session?  how are you getting there?  ATV, car, backpacking?  how far is it?  these factors make a huge difference in what you bring while camping, if you have a vechicle, you can bring heavier items that add to the comfort aspect, if your backpacking, your looking for lighter, more multi use items so you can pack lighter with less things.|`|9e1a0e459c90e3a8eb8741a8fb042e12aa	It takes me less than 5 minutes.

It's part of capitalism.  A salary cap would be unfair to players (I know they make a ton of money, but they make a ton of money for their teams) and revenue sharing only works if there is an incentive for all the teams to spend the money they get on the team (or lower ticket prices, anything beside the owner pocketing the money.)    The thing that doesn't get mentioned, and that might be the way to address it, is the anti-competitive way MLB restricts teams from moving to a new market.  Teams get to boycott any move that would put another team in their back yard.  In a pure capitalist market other teams could move to the best market.  Eventually that market would get saturated and things would even out.  Of course, a lot of small markets would lose their teams.      The big argument against expansion (aside from diluting pitching) is that there aren't many markets big enough to support a team that don't have a team.  If a new team could start up in NYC or Boston it would draw off some of the big teams revenue and they would be more like small market teams.  Remember, NYC used to have three teams instead of just two.  Cities don't want this though, since building the infrastructure for a big league park is pretty substantial investment and they don't want their teams relocating every couple of years.|`|QASHySUbaa	They are one out of two baseball teams from New York|`|Cr0wCMzlaa	Idiot !

u3FqxhY8aa	You are only 15 don't go on a diet.  Just eat within reason and use your common sense.  Going on a diet while you are still growing could actually be more detramental (the possibility of growing 2 or 3 more inches is much more helpful over the long run than losing a few pounds).  You probably already know the basics of dieting just follow those, that will probably be the healthiest thing for you, and excercise is probably just as important so don't forget to do your physical training which may be more important in high school tennis.

Trade Briere and Nitty to Anaheim for Giguere?  JS is pissed right now with the time share and the fact he is getting quick yanks while Hiller is being allowed to tough it out.    Hedberg might move, maybe Dallas as a rental backup, as they obviously don't trust Tobias, as evidenced by them playing Turco no matter how he does.    Maybe they can get one of those  "Slap Chop"  for him|`|rvE7gyuUaa	I don't see the Flyers making a goalie move.  I think Homer is focusing on making an upgrade in defense (even though we have 8 back there) and also maybe a slight upgrade on the wing somewhere.
u8GHTJEEaa	I saw Andre the Giant (R.I.P.) in person several times in his younger days and he was a legit 7 feet 4 inches tall. As he grew older and his health worsened, he lost some of his bone mass and stood several inches shorter (his actual height was listed by different sources from as tall as 6 feet 10 inches to as short as 6 feet 8 inches) at the time of his death.|`|CK45Qeulaa	I think so|`|DxsRO6EOaa	wwe were just exadurating it...............i've seen that tape many times cus wwe wont stop god dawm playing it!!!!!!  he was like 7ft i think|`|B0BNboXEaa	no he was only 7.1.5    kane is 6.7 and undertaker is 6.8    they like to lie|`|EA7oEQwMaa	not sure

If he get's All-Star MVP, it won't matter if the Cavs and the Lakers make the Finals, he will give the championship trophy to him...

So the All-Star game MVP is nothing compared to that.|`|sulB8fwkaa	a mad one|`|yWcPOTsAaa	He'd win if it was a flopping contest|`|TjCUwheSaa	that would be stupid & crazy ill be piss|`|7t7XzXsVaa	No one will pass the ball to him lol.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Wouldn't care.

I wouldn't mind if he deserves it.|`|KYaM65gzaa	its been a number of years now that Uncle David (good one hehe) has just been organising the winners he wants. Im not gonna slam anyone that actually believes Celts and Lakers were the two best teams in the league last year but I will raise an eyebrow or two. All-Star game is less than meaningless. at least in the 80s and 90s the players actually cared about who won and not who did the "sickest" dunk. the dunk contest is a joke too. i cant believe weve reached a point where something as boring as the three point contest is more interesting than the dunk contest. Stern needs to be fired if one cant see that he is full of favouritism for the celts and lakers then one needs glasses.    PS Paulina Pierce is an immature child|`|BiMkowVMaa	I would collapse to the floor, then get lifted into my wheelchair and get dragged off into the bedroom. But once dinner was ready I'll spring back to life!!!    IT'S A MIRACLE!!!! I CAN WALK!!!! GIVE ME MVP...

AA11488609	They say that every off season will be full of trades, and most of the time, we don't see too many of them. Last year was one of those years when many teams made moves, and only one team, the Lakers, got better out of the move.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes....  Apparently there are going to be quite a few trades...  Thats what the rumor people say though....|`|2a3a337e777a7c75d398bb5edd3f008aaa	The latest and dumbest is Raef Lafrentz and another player (Sacramento wants Bayless) for John Salmons. Don't ask me how this could possibly work salary wise but it's all over the internet. Check Hoopshype.com for the latest rumors|`|QdK6qLjOaa	A big rumor is that a deal is in the works that would send Jermaine O'Neal to Miami for Shawn Marion.    Also Chad Ford had a column i read on RealGM that had a list of players and their probability of being traded.    Shawn Marion 80%     Mike Miller 65%    Wally Szczerbiak 60%    John Salmons 55%    Vince Carter 45%    Marquis Daniels 40%    Allen Iverson 25%    Josh Howard 20%    Lamar Odom 15%    Corey Maggette 10%    Tracy McGrady 5%|`|cfWKju4naa	I've heard Howard and Stack for Shaq and Barnes. Would work out moneywise for both teams. as a dallas fan, I'm all for it.|`|m3b9tL6Faa	There are actually a decent amount of trade talked for the NBA.    1- Shawn Marion to the Raptors for J.O'Neal. Trade talks keep coming up but it dies then it gets brought up again. The problem is the Heat want J.Moon in the mix but i dont think Raptors want to give up Moon    2-Keith Bogans of the magic is on the market, Magic "need" a PF. In which the Nets are offering Eduardo Najera. Not 100% sure why they need a PF when they have a C.... Howard!!!!    3- Another one i just read about which is def. a rumor is Jason Kidd to Portland. I know, it is probally not true. But i jsut heard about it.    4-Brad Miller and Kenny Thomas to Miami for Shawn Marion??????    5-Blazers have offered a draft pick and Raef LaFrentz's expiring contract for John Salmons of the Kings    6-Allen Iverson back on the trade block???    7-All of the suns on block excluding Nash.    8- Bobby Simmons for Larry Hughes    im sure there is more i cant really think of anymore tho.

Upton. The guy has blazing speed, cannon for an arm, excellent fielder, hit for power, and hit for average.     His brother Justin has potential to be even better.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	There are a few Siezemore, Rollins, Curtic Granderson, Carlos Beltran and watch out for Nate Mc Louth|`|3271d55c05b22f144699a128e1626d80aa	Hamilton for sure.....he is the man!|`|g9P7oWyeaa	Hanley Ramirez first comes to mind.

a0b2fe29949cc72e3bea4e32380a37baaa	In the NHL? I'm thinking the refs would sit back and let it play out longer then a normal fight. That's a franchise problem, not a fairness problem. Great question!|`|76nTvO4iaa	I saw it happen at a junior game last season.    A bunny was playing players off against each other.  Adolescent male hormones being what they are, things got out of hand.    The ref blew the whistle.  There was a delay of game penalty called.|`|J4xsLrnoaa	on your TEAM !|`|2OoSK35xaa	The scenario to my knowledge has never played out in hockey, other sports it has though.  But the game shouldn't be stopped unless both teams were involved.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Yup, blow the whistle.  A fight distracts everyone's attention, holds up the game, so the whistle would have to blow.    Has a fight between two people on the same team ever happened?  Well, if you think about it...A fight erupts for three reasons i) An overly-hard body check/spearing, ii) Reaction to a 'sucker punch', or iii) Done in defence of another player, typically a goalie.  Hard to see how two players on the same team could thus be involved...That leaves the only reason for fighting as a personal vendetta, and would it be worth it to do that against someone in full hockey gear?|`|64LZW2y8aa	I don't think the refs would do anything, but the players from that team would get involved and seperate the two men. Then, the referees might hand the team a penalty for delay of game.|`|QQqhzuNDaa	The creeps in the stands would enjoy the violence in any form it takes.|`|paZQs0PEaa	A friend of mine played hockey a while back in Canada and said he witnessed two of his teamates having a fight.  The play was stopped and the team was issued a two minute minor delay of game.|`|KnPff3JQaa	Haha great question.  This has happened with my team.  My goalie and another player from my team got in a fight with each other one the ice, and my goalie ended up getting a roughing penalty.|`|9vNeOUBUaa	I've gotten in to a fight with my own teammate at practice but I've never witnessed it in a game lol good question....the closest I've ever seen was one guy on my team said something to another guy on my team that pissed him off and he slashed him pretty hard during play lol  ( I think he was telling him what to do )
P8j4vgs1aa	You get called for Delay Of Game (2 minute minor).  You only get called when you touch the puck with the broken stick and if you let go of the stick you can then still continue play ... meaning you can hit someone as long as you drop the broken stick|`|z7JsVzcnaa	http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule45.html    That's the official rule on broken sticks.|`|gEZDw6Oyaa	they haven't established a name for it yet so they just call it delay of game for now until they think of a name|`|VC5mEULTaa	I believe it is simply called broken stick, or playing with a broken stick.    I'm not quite sure what you mean in the last part(a little confusing to understand). But if a player realizes his stick is broken he must drop it or else he would get a penalty.    Rule 10.3 states "A player whose stick is broken may participate in the game provided he drops the broken stick. A minor penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule."    ****Thanks. The rule above answers it I guess. If the stick is broken he has to immediately drop it.|`|J4xsLrnoaa	playing with a broken stick

WZvny7mMaa	I am a Laker fan and I know that Shaq was the best player on those championship teams. It is only the Kobe jockers that don't give Shaq credit.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i agree with you 100%, but these Kobe jockers were too young to remember when Shaq was on their team. without Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant would be just another Stephon Marbury.|`|KYaM65gzaa	team effort just like any other title or finals run (barring 2007 cavs), but Shaq was the main guy. much as they dont like to believe it, lakers fans are bandwagoners, just not to the great extent that celtics fans are bandwagoners they spend all their time calling each other fake fans even though theyre all fake. well all the celtics ones, not all the lakers ones but the vast majority. celts fans were chanting MVP for Kobe two years ago LOL  they just dont like Shaq cause he left. Shaq took every team hes played for to the finals (not phoenix who hes only played for for nine months). i hate him as much as any of you but he knows how to win in this league|`|2dgVkcVAaa	true shaq got LA those Rings and not Kobe back then.|`|reIMLCKkaa	All true lakers fans from that era and before will give Shaq credit. He lead us to 3 rings. People are just defending Kobe. Everyone says it was all Shaq but it wasnt. Kobe won many of the game when Shaq was out and Kobe showed up after court and gave 110% everynight. No one is bashing shaq they just dont agree that it seems Kobe is underrated for his part on that team, Even Shaq will say Kobe was his best teammate and hi best 1 & 2 combo player he ever had. Kobe was Better than Wade to Shaq. He says it all the time... I loved Shaq in college, Orl and I have always been a lakers fan but Shaq made me a Magic fan aswell. When he came to LA i was happy and will always be greatful for him and Kobe|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I don't know, I suppose some Laker fans don't give Shaq credit, but if they do they don't know anything about the game or there just plain ignorant. To me it was how Shaq left the Lakers that put a bad taste in my mouth. And he did the same thing in Miami.|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	nope we do... I do believe that we always say that Shaq and Kobe led the Lakers to 3 championships...|`|xt00f5Qoaa	Shaq is the reason that Kobe has 3 rings. besides that Shaq is just a beast.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Whoever said that Kobe was the mastermind of the Three-peat dynasty was blind...    I give total credit to the entire team from 2000-2002 (Kobe, Shaq, Fox, Fisher, Horry, etc...) and Shaq was the best player on the team. He's dropping points that Kobe is dropping today. Shaq is one of the greatest players of the 90's and 2000's and he was everybody's worst nightmare at that moment.|`|kzAgfqhyaa	Because most Laker fans are biased and stubborn. They dont really think outside of the box. All they know is Kobe is one of the best players in the world right now, so he has to be the best player of all time right? He has to be better then MJ and Magic right? He led the lakers to finals all 3 of thos times even tho Shaq put up better numbers and was the Finals MVP right?  Not all laker fans, but the extreme ones are all stubborn.|`|AA11488609	They aren't Laker fans.  they are Kobe fans.      But in my opinion, as a non Laker or non Kobe fan, which is pretty objective in my opinion, Shaq and Kobe needed each other to win those ships.  Shaq couldn't do it on his own and neither could Kobe.  When he won the 2006 title, he needed Dwayne Wade or the Heat wouldn't have made the Finals, and vice versa.|`|uxregJ0faa	???? Shaq was the dominant center at the time what are you talking about. Shaq and Kobe were the two main piece in those 3 championships. All we are saying is that Shaq could not have done it without Kobe and Kobe could not do it without Shaq.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Shaq is my second fav. player...  So I think I do give Shaq the credit..    The reason Lakers fans might discredit Shaq is because the Kobe haters always tend to say that Kobe is nothing without Shaq......  So in order to defend Kobe....they have to discredit Shaq....    You are going to discredit Lebron too when he leaves for NY....  Thats just the way it is...    EDIT: the perfect example of MY example is "Tarzan"..

sO14BlN0aa	I sword fight a lot and its always good to train your biceps and lower arm muscles for maximum leverage and ease when wielding your weapon. :) usually it depends on the sword and how your fighting style is.  Also depends on the weight of your sword.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Forearms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    I have done a lot of sword fighting. the truth is every thing on your arms get sore but nothing like your forearms. Honestly though, the part of me that got the most sore was my gluteus muscles.

Most of the strength you exert......like while kicking, punching or even sword fighting...you exert your force from within your core.  So, if you've got a strong core, you can probably handle everything.    I will refer you to a website on which you can see how to strengthen your core.......  http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do...|`|oTb67zNYaa	mostly the forearms and wrists as far as arms are concerned      also I would like to add that fencing is real sword fighting in that it teaches many things that any swordfighter should learn if we assume that both fighters are unarmored it all starts to look like fencing the emphasis on thrusts mostly because a stab is faster and more lethal in most cases than a cut|`|3BGJETHYaa	You need strong shoulders to be capable of keeping your sword up.  Cut, split, and carry wood.  Its honestly great exercise for the muscles you need.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	swords are not that heavy, the majority of swords use in past and present were less then 5 lbs    as for muscles, forearms, upper arms, shoulders, back, abdomen.  you use your entire body when sword fighting not just a few arm muscles.|`|55nophEPaa	you only need enough muscles to weild/ swing/ stab the sword. the rest is just skill. comes with practice.       p.s. sword fights dont usually last more than 1-3 moves.

I mean, i think hes good friends with The Rock.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	The Rock is half-Samoan half-Black Canadian and apparently he is one of Austin's real-life best friends.    He's also good friends with Bill Goldberg who is Jewish and Jim Ross who is part Native American.     So I doubt it.|`|QqDkjCAzaa	no|`|lrS8UXnYaa	No|`|GJQIL0RZaa	ROfL|`|947f4523822b8ab2652a16c0a6cd278aaa	he is a bald white redneck from texas and he seemed pretty comfortable saying the "n" word in the longest yard. or maybe he is just a good actor.|`|gOLUlRP9aa	No. He's just badass.
XrCc85kNaa	Yes...  It does  count and it is fair...    If they are gonna count it if you make it.....why wont they count it against you if you miss??  ------------------  I actually did answer the question perfectly...  --------------  How the **** does that not answer the question??  Stop trying to be a smart azz  --------------------------------------...  I know....  But IF it counts FOR you if you make it....  Then it SHOULD count against you IF you dont make it....  That is FAIR!!!!!!  I am not trying to call u names or anything but I dont get how my answer doesn't answer your question....|`|dDhTMacAaa	It does and it;s fair.    A common joke is actually said after a player attempts a buzzer beating half-court (or further) shot.    "Man, your hurting your shooting percentage!"    lol|`|K1iUzewyaa	yes... but it is the chance you take when you release the ball.. either it goes in, or it doesn't.. but if you make it and your team wins by 1 or 2... ahh.. priceless....|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Yes. It all depends if you get the shot off before the buzzer though.   But, yes it counts as a longgggggggggggg three.|`|X1mEeYyfaa	Yea it does, I don't really think it's unfair. If it's a potential game winning shot, I don't think the shooter would be worrying about their field goal percentage dropping from ONE missed shot. If they're throwing it up for the heck of it, that's their decision. It's one shot, big deal. Can you imagine a player holding the ball instead of taking a game winning shot because they didn't want to hurt their FG %? I can't.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	yes it does count for your field percentage since you released the shot in regulation period.|`|frNinsBjaa	Yes every shot count against your FG%   even when someone foul you and you shoot it
bpqv4O2Aaa	I might just watch it in HBO when it comes out.  The Marine was OK but I dislike Cena too much since he's the one who lead the WWE to the new "PG era"  His acting is good and so is his moves in the movies but he''s still disliked by many traditional fans like me. Sorry.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	I don't think he can wrestler.. and i also think he's a bad actor.. but this new movie actually seems pretty good imma gonna check it out..|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	i watched what a year ago oh no that was the marine same crap|`|9ijwrcTZaa	No....even if I liked him I wouldnt see it.  His movie, "You Cant C Me"    I dont like that kind of film.........|`|7ACBEowxaa	no, his acting is a joke|`|t5ZrMtkLaa	hell yea im gonna see it, im a big time cena fan, and i thought the marine was ok so im thinking that 12 rounds is gonna be better|`|FJO5wqsvaa	i would, i hate cena, but it looks good|`|eX7An0AKaa	No. I see Cena enough as it is. :) JK.  The movie doesn't seem at all appealing, if it did i would go see it regardless. Being a fan or not really doesn't matter to me. I'm a fan of Mr. Kenndys, but there's no way i'm watching his movie. :)|`|RiFtRVs8aa	Yeah I guess. I hate Cena but I would watch the movie.|`|NGcqjv1Faa	Yes i will see it. Because, i don't like Cena the WWE character but, i have no problem with him in real life.|`|334JQ9ACaa	no way, the movie looks horrible in the trailer|`|mSCjQizVaa	No, I see him enough, he's a sucky actor, and it looked kind of dumb so...no.|`|Agsp62ttaa	No, it doesn't seem to be a movie I would want to watch.  If it seemed alright I would see it, even though I don't particuarly like Cena.    But it just doesn't appeal to me.
GuGFzOUnaa	dude there was no chris benoit.....that dialogue was said by edge,shawn michales and rey mysterio........so maybe ur were just thinking about benoit and then u thought u say a glimpse of him|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I think it was just you,you must of saw someone who looked kind of smilier and your eyes were playing tricks on you.But the wwe won't show anything with Benoit because that is just an invitation for the media to start attacking.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	I don't recall seeing Chris Benoit in it. Maybe it was JBL and you saw it wrong?|`|b7U8izC2aa	i didnt see benoit at all|`|AA12022123	no the ones they showd in order was shawn michaels to rey mysterio to edge and then i think big show
4l0yGuE9aa	Well they wave a yellow flag and turn on yellow lights around the track and this lets the drivers know there has been a wreck. They also send a car out that keeps a slow pace that the race cars line up behind to insure that they are traveling at a safe speed while the wrecked cars are removed. If the wreck is really bad and/or there is a lot of debris on the track then they might stop the race. This will be indicated by them waving a red flag and NASCAR also tells them over their 2-way radios. Once everything is safe they allow the drivers to pit, fuel up, make changes, and get new tires and they resume the race.|`|vrXiRA94aa	^ ^ ^ ^ ^    You make me proud to be a NASCAR nation member, ICE. Well done.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Nice answer Ice!  He said it all for you.|`|sx8WSLlgaa	When there is a wreck the other drivers try to avoid it.|`|osN2GFY9aa	Depends on how serious the wreck is.  A caution (yellow flag) will wave, drivers have to slow down to "pit row speed" while the safety safari or clean up crew will clear the wreckage.  A wrecker will haul the wrecked car(s) away.      If it's the "big one" they may "red flag" the race - meaning the drivers will stop their cars on the track.  Drivers are NOT allowed to get out of their cars.|`|JSryPP8faa	The man from ICE know's best.|`|iT8CNh6paa	They flagman throws the caution flag and the cars slow as the safety crews approach the car. if they need serious help or a lot of debris they will throw the red flag and stop the race.|`|qJrTQaGAaa	Well the other drives have to slow down cause the yellow flag is thrown out  but it really depends on how bad the car accident is but i seen in nascar other drivers get out to help if they were in the accident themselfs but the only time nascar races get stop if the crash is blocking the track off then they throw the red flag out to get it cleaned up|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Sometimes if the crash is bad enough....it's called a red flag condition.  But mostly they throw yellow flags called a caution period....then the other cars must slow down to approx 50-60 mph the speed of the pace car and slowly proceed around the track while safety workers attend to the driver(s) involved. Drivers have helped others in the past again if it was a bad crash and looked as if safety workers couldn't get there in time. Marvin Panch in the 60's was rescued by Tiny Lund. Kyle Petty in 1991 crashed hard at Martinsville and knocked out...Geoff Bodine pulled him out. So again it depends on the severity of the crash.    Just an opinion as always.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	^^^unless your name is Sterling Marlin^^^    lmao|`|OnXX13yCaa	in the old days guys like david pearson and dick trickle used to light up a smoke and relax.

The only way I see it happening, is if they build a dome in Seattle, and even after that, there's only a small chance.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Too cold, only if they had a dome stadium or played it during the summer.|`|Ah5KDMALaa	maybe if the nfl has any brains|`|LpR9sLSlaa	it's really cold n wet in Seattle in Jan/Feb    so probably not  at least not outdoors|`|TN1j7oL1aa	YES IT ALL TAKES TIME|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No because of the climate.|`|P93I8CHtaa	since over in the northwest rains often,i doubt it|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Not likely.

CBVlu3Gvaa	Since height is not a measurement used in determining lie angle its impossible to give you the specific answer you are looking for.  My best advice would be to go to a Club fitter and have him determine the optimum lie angle for you and make the adjustments to your clubs if necessary.  Normally this is not an expensive situation to fix if needed.|`|7mhqRhJKaa	A Custom clubmaker can check your physical measurements and also check the existing lie angle on your irons.  He will then be able to make recommendations.  Most, but not all, irons can be adjusted slightly.  The clubmaker will be able to tell you, and make the necessary adjustments for you.

iD3XXaMOaa	I will be rooting for Federer as always. I will give him a 21 gun salute if he wins & equals the great Pete Sampras.    The kind of skill Federer has displayed in the last 2 matches (with Del Potro & Roddick) was amazing. He was simply toying with Del Potro....the head butt winner was proof enough. I agree Nadal is a class above all these players but if Roger can play like that he will win. On the fast hardcourts of the Australian Open, Nadal will have a tough time running down Federer forehands.    Nadal will do well simply to recover in time after the marathon epic 5 hour+ match. But knowing the bull fighter he is, he will be ready and ready when the final gets underway.|`|4xmYRPaHaa	watch out here    http://sportsp2p.com/|`|qyR1TLWxaa	surely 100% the winner is ROGER FEDERER .No doubt about this.He is the king in the tennis.......|`|P6AeR7Fwaa	Go, Rafa, Go!! you can do it!!  Federer is amazing, but I'll say all my prayers for Rafa Nadal to win the Aussie Open.    The whole Spain is with you.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	federer|`|onkUcy19aa	As usual, I will bet all my marbles for Nadal's victory. The guy is awesome, although Federer has the technical skills, Nadal's over-all moves could see him through with a close win.|`|cs7qQ1Wyaa	Both look in great form but federer especially and also we dont know how nadal will backup that great contest vs verdasco , im going for nadal but federer will probley win.|`|a6CxaY2baa	I think people know Nadal is in trouble physically. Nadal will be there mentally, but physically as well? I'm not sure that I'm buying that. I think he knows that he will lose to Roger this sunday in 4 sets maximum, or in 3 close sets. Now, if Nadal wins it, than I'll say he's truly the  1 because it will be a Hercules effort to come back from a 5 and 1/4 hour match to then beat Federer for his first hardcourt major - the australian open. I do got to say that had both semifinals played on the same day, maybe the quality of the men's final on sunday would be of more of quality despite the long 5 set epic Nadal had to face because both would have equal amount of 2 days to rest though Federer would be more fresh. It wouldn't be nice for me to see my favorite player crushing Nadal because he was worn out. If Federer wins, which I want him to, I want him to win in the right away earning it, not by winning because Nadal is too worn out to play because I'm a true Roger fan. So...Allez Federer!|`|iS4oVr7caa	Federer, obviously, had way more experience than Nadal. Yet, since the past months, Nadal has proven to be a better player, and hence taken the  1 Rank.    It could really go either way, you know. They both are awesome players (:
OfNTLq3Qaa	Use the force Jedi...It's scripted!|`|7rpILeYtaa	its scripted|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Scripted.|`|EUdHcGW1aa	It's all scripted.|`|m3b9tL6Faa	scripted it all scripted.. everything in the wwe is script.|`|1UKAho1iaa	All of the story lines are scripted.  To the person above me: people aren't necessarily saying that wrestling is fake. We realize that a lot of the moves the wrestlers take are real and real injuries do occur. We're just saying that the story lines are scripted and the outcomes of matches are predetermined.|`|QqDkjCAzaa	real|`|pE7pG9pPaa	LMAO!! They're scripted storylines, just like everything else.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	LOL lol LOL Lol|`|zc95NVITaa	i want to know, why do people think wwe is more fake then real?? has a wwe wrestler openly admitted that its fake?? or the fact that their bones that get dislocated are fake???!?!? or the choreographed moves are fake??? wwe is not that fake, i mean wwe wrestlers do get nervous when they are lifted 6 ft above the air and some do get scared when a guy belly flops them. if you had a one on one with snitsky in the wwe ring i swear you would crap your pants my friends!! so don't judge and just enjoy!!    p.s- i don't care about the storyline, its probably real anyway.
OfNTLq3Qaa	He's good but the best heel ever was Ric Flair during the glory years of the Four Horsemen.|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Yes, he is. Out of all heels ever, he is probably the best. i mean he's been a heel for practicly his whole career, and he rocks at it!!|`|7ACBEowxaa	i wouldnt go on saying he is the best ever, he is one of the best,    Triple H was awsome heel    The Rock    Hollywood Hogan    they were better than Edge.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Not the best but I think the best today,to those who say RKO is better,I gotta say he gets cheered a lot and I hear RKO chants all the time..|`|Gr7My8FTaa	no matt hardy is|`|77uc2xXUaa	Ever?  No.  I think Ric Flair was.  The dirtiest player in the game!|`|7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	Edge is very good, but RKO may be a hair better!|`|FY8YYZgBaa	No, though he's definitely up there!|`|a5X1sHHpaa	Right now Edge is the best heel in smackdown  RKO for raw  ECW is just effed.    but Randy is the best heel EVER!  hes getting hyped as a heel,pushed as a heel, dang he is a heel.    Stone Cold was a Good Heel but his fan respect makes him a Tweener .|`|ABRPsjwBaa	He's totally a great heel,but not the best.There are far better heels than him,in my opinion.Eddie Guerrero,Steve Austin,The Rock,etc.,just to name a few=)|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Totally, he rocks!!!  He deserves to be champ and one day, he will become the best champ in history! :)|`|b7U8izC2aa	I got to admit he is one of the best heel but i Orton is the superior heel in the entire wwe. That is my opinion. 2009 is the year of Orton.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Greatest|`|6jewV8lZaa	He is one of the best heel ever. And I am glad he won the belt back.|`|cD3Ej7GGaa	Not if you like him that much|`|ZK3x8pbBaa	Is he a good heel?  Yes.  Best heel ever... HEEECK No.  Even Y2J ATM is better then him.|`|6e88e6122f96ab00e51f25de52859bcaaa	Edge is getting there...although he's got to match villains of the past like Ric Flair, Hollywood Hogan, the original Sheik, Abdullah the Butcher, and General Skandor Akbar to earn the title of best heel ever.|`|XAdiOhMpaa	no roddy piper is

Kobe is so overrated he is the reigning Most Valuable Player.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Why dont YOU make your argument on how Wade/Lebron is better than Kobe...  After all.....you are the one asking the question...    Kobe aint overrated...  If you believe so...give me some damn stats...  or get a grip!!!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I can't because he's not overrated. Case closed, end of discussion.|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	kobe is overrated coz he made the finals 5 times without getting swept. Kobe is overrated coz he scored 81 pts in a game. Kobe is overrated coz he shut down LeBron during their game. Kobe is overrated coz kobe doesn't need the media to be great *coughs* LeBron *coughs*    Kobe is overrated coz he doesnt need Shaq to make it to the finals *coughs* Wade *coughs* Kobe had 5 straight 50 pts game and is leading the best team in the league right now... u don't see LeBron and Wade doing that...     Kobe is overrated coz he doesnt need Nike to be good and most and importantly kobe don't use Steroids...|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I don't think kobe's overrated. He has rings for gods sake. Why do you people hate on the guy. He has rings, scoring titles, all NBA teams, alll defensive teams, and now an MVP award. he wasnt even drafted  1 overall. Please explain to me how kobe bryant is overrated.
OfNTLq3Qaa	It's not bad for a first version but I wouldn't buy it. Wait until they put out a few more.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Six|`|8Try9VSqaa	don't get it, it not that great of a game, its just like smackdown vs raw, same controls, but then again its got few good matches like six sided steel cage and the thing were u climb on the ropes above the ring, its just ur opinion wheater u like it or not, get it if u interested.

Depending on the condition and the serial number it could be  $1000 or up. If he has one already, try searching for one with a serial number that is very close if not adjacent in the series.

Last year, I made a deal with my wife. I don't pick out her shoes, and she doesn't pick out my guns. Seriously, a gun can be a pretty personal decision, and he may have his sights set on a particular one (pun intended), but doesn't want to spend the money on it. If you buy him a gift card, ot take him to the store, he'll be able to pick out just the one he wants, and you'll have the pleasure of knowing that you got him something he really liked.|`|C1fBdw95aa	A kimber 1911 would be nice.

xt00f5Qoaa	i would get rid of O'Neal he is done Robinson is doing so much better than him|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Neither and why the **** would you want Nate. I am a Knicks fan and love what our team is becoming and yes Nate is athletic and he can score, but can do no more and has terrible fantasy value for the following reasons. He is a terrible % shooter before a couple a games ago he was shooting 15% spanning a 3 week period. He does not defend, does not get assists, does not rebound. The only thing he does good dunk - he does not do in game play cause his height exposes him to rejections. He also has terrible basketball IQ and makes very costly plays because he forces the action. If you want a real baller on the Knicks you go for David Lee, Wilson Chandler, Chris Duhon, and Al Harrington.    Mike Dunleavy is a hell of a scorer exceeded Nate. Last, year Dunleavy was a 19+ PPG scorer and this year can get it to that again. JO gives double-doubles, and you will be foolish to give up All-star talent in RJ for Nate.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	Mike Dunleavy|`|D6Llh23Baa	i'd drop jermaine o'neal for nate. mike dunleavy is one integral part of indiana's offense. he gives you decent stats. richard jefferson will have his stats boosted because of redd's season-ending injury. expect jefferson to have more ppg, apg and 3pts.  i love nate robinson, he might seem inconsistent but remember, d'antoni loves using him. so he will get 25 to 30 minutes a game. expect decent points, assists and 3points.  jermaine is a very injury-prone player, so i'd choose nate over him.|`|frNinsBjaa	Richard Jefferson

Nate comes off the bench and is similar to Dunleavy|`|XzhjWTA2aa	maybe jermaine, but everyone else is producing better than robinson,  dunleavy will only get better, and jefferson should pad his stats more with redd out for the season.|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	Richard Jefferson|`|G2QNxy6oaa	No way he is not that good he is just cool because he is 5'8 and can through it down
bb5100070c97a382ec014551035edff9aa	There are many places on the Internet where you can find answers to this question,  Please read the chapters of my coaching book on the Internet that describe the equipment you need and the steps.  The link is below.    I've shaped boards since the late 1960 and can give you a few suggestions. Very few shapers will teach you to shape so you will mostly need to learn on your own.  Also, shaping is only 1/2 the problem.  You also need to glass.    First step, buy two blanks so when you destroy the first one you will learn from the mistakes and can shape the second one better.    Depending on if you buy a first or second, the blanks will cost you about $80 each.  You will need a planer ($100), surforms ($20), sanding blocks and you will need to make a strong shaping stand.  You will also need light so you will be able to spot uneven lines.  The blanks will cost you about $80 each.  Then you need to make a template from a design that you like.  There is a section on this in the book ad well. Shaping with no experience will take you about 3 hours for your first board.    After you shape your board, don't let it get dirty before you glass it.  Again, there are many sources on the internet besides my book on how to glass.  Look in the board building sections of my online library.  Curing relates to glassing, not shaping.  Also, unless you mix the resins correctly, you will distroy what you shaped very easily.    The glassing material will run around $90 to $100 with the fin boxes running another $30 depending on what you get.  Just search the internet and you find the closest source of materials.  Many shops sell kits for board building.  Glassing takes around 4 hours total not counting curing time.    Before you sand, make yourself some finbox templates and mount your boxes.The last suggestion is sanding.  Since you don't know what you are doing, hand sand only and spend some time.

KDOIKIq2aa	It depends on how the law is written and passed.  Historically a banned item is banned from new production.  Those made, sold and in your safe are said to be grandfathered under the law.  But that's not saying what will happen this time or next time.    Don't wait till this happens, write, call, e-mail your elected officials and tell them you do not want a firearms ban of any kind.  Make sure you tell them your vote in their future depends on their actions now.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	They will make you register it, presumably paying an annoying fee, and you won't be able to buy parts or magazines.|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	it would be grandfathered in at that point...all they can do is stop you from buying new guns and they cant take away what you already have|`|AA11850523	nothing happens  you are grandfathered in to be able to keep what you already own|`|h2KkiKK3aa	they'll send a message out by every form of communication like TV, radio and newspapers to bring the guns to a certain drop off point like a police station or a gun shop, ect, before a certain date.  if you don't give them up before the due date, they'll come into your home with warrants and search for the firearm, no matter what, you'd be charged with possessing a illegal firearm and get thrown in jail.  but it'll never happen, he doesn't have the authority or the man power to ban any form of gun, because the second amendment protects your right to own that firearm, the government is already doing illegal things behind the american peoples backs by banning any form of firearm from civilian possession, the 2nd amendment even allows you to own a cannon or a full auto gun and they have nothing to say about it, also, restricting the public by forcing them to get licenses and having to pay taxes on their guns is also illegal because it's a restriction of your right to bear arms,   the american people should rise and step out this government from office and bring in fair laws that their fore fathers died and worked for.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	" Guns only have two (2*) Enemy's, Rust & Politicians."..

Later on, the Fed Gov can pass a registration law requiring anyone who owns an "Assault Rifle" to register it. This is not in violation of the 2nd Amendment as several states already do it.    After that, they can ban ownership of "Assault Weapons" as they have no legitimate "sporting" use. This would not be against the 2nd Amendment as several states already do ban them.     Neither of these actions would deny you the right to bear arms, only certain types of arms.    Later on, they could expand a registration or ban to include any semi-auto firearm (rifle, pistol, shotgun).    Don't think it can happen? ALL the top Democrats; Pelosi, Reid, Clinton, Biden and Obama, have clearly spoken and voted in the past to eventually reach that goal (and some even further).    If it looks like that is going to happen, I expect there will be a rash of gun sales (Sorry, I sold those guns...Nope, I don't remember their names.)    Better wake up.|`|taXN33w7aa	The ban would only prevent the buying of the weapons. If you already have one, you can keep it legally. They can't take away your gun unless you use it in an illegal way.

CnNAOoWgaa	Yes, tennis is very tough on your back and can lead to serious back pain.  I had a chiropractor ask me the same question when I had a back ache and he told me that the force of swinging your racket puts alot of pressure on your back and can throw it out of place.  He suggested that I switch from a one handed to two handed backhand and with more balance in my swing and two hands on he racket, the strain on my back was reduced.  Swinging a racket hard with one arm can throw your back out of kilter so I'm not surprised that your chiropractor was concerned about this.
5xAu3RAZaa	in order from best to worst:  running outdoors  running treadmill  running in place      running outfdoors compares to running in place because u make better strides and a good form, since u actually have to move  runing in place is basically just jumpnig from one foot to another.  and treadmills aren't as accurate, and you can't really get your own pace, unless you constantly change the speed,        so honestly, its worth going outside in the cold to run outdoors.|`|Cv1FhPJmaa	well running outdoors is toally better 4 me bcause you can see scenery round you and look at things that are totally beautiful and you get to smelll fresh f'n air|`|55nophEPaa	i dont exercise much but my friends who do say running in place and on a treadmill  puts extra strain on your joints and is bad for you to do in excess. running in place gives you the least productive workout. running outside is the best: less strain, more production, less bordom....
poEJEuwNaa	The best explanation (with pictures and all) I have ever seen of all the grips can be found at http://www.tennis.com/grips    The extreme one you were using was most likely either western or maybe semi-western. Nadal uses the western to get that incredible topspin. Your best grip doesn't really depend on left or right hand, but what style of game you play. If you prefer to stay on the baseline, then an extreme grip is not a problem. If you like to come to net, then it is more difficult to change to a volley (continental) grip.|`|Om4oZd3Vaa	Lefties are the same as right-handed, as far as I know.    If you're a beginner, hold the racquet like you're shaking hands with it, as close to the base of the grip as is comfortable.    If you gain experience and want to add top spin, twist the grip so that your index knuckle (the knuckle connected to your hand) lines up with the flat part of the wider sides (they line up with the racquet face).    Probably doesn't make much sense if you're not holding a racquet...

You may need to try a few to get better accuracy, but again, if you can put 5 shots within 3 inches at 100 yards be happy with the factory ammo. I Zero at 200 yards, so your 100 yard group should be 1.75 high to be on at 200 yards.  EDIT: Always try to get a BONDED bullet for deer and other big game.    EDIT: I have groups of 5 shots from my Browning A-Bolt that I can cover with a quarter at 100 yards just using a sandbag rest.

There is no need for that. There is no need for a big wound or hole.  A .223 has plenty of velocity and doesn't cause a huge wound wasting a bunch of meat.  Core lock light as you can find will travel fast and and do all you need it to. Distance, wind, altitude and many other factors contribute to the difference in need for different bullets.  100 or 200 yard shots don't have to be that big. Take your time and wait for proper shot placement.  Technically a bb double lunging the animal and nicking the heart would be best right?

6Mpi3Bgjaa	I give Curry the benfit of the doubt...    1...He is working with a group of Veteran players who seemingly hasn't listened to a coach since being under the tutelege of Larry Brown, Curry in fairness may never have the chance to put his stamp on this particular group, because I imagine after the Chauncey trade that Curry will have a revamped roster to work with in the coming years as the Pistons wheel and deal in the free agent Markets of 2009 and 2010    2...The players aren't really playing hard, I know I've read some reports that the Pistons group aren't to fascinated playing with Iverson as he is prone to throw up wild shots instead of working the ball for a better shot with his upgraded teammates....This Pistons team is not the same group that we've come to know since the days of 2004....They lack that defensive effort and have grown complacent, the last player who exemplifies this attitude is Rasheed Wallace (Chauncey did too by the way which is why I don't mind him leaving)....expect the Pistons to be quite busy this offseason as they move on with life without Rasheed and AI    3...Let's also not judge the Iverson trade until 2 or 3 years down the line and we look at the free agent acquisitions that the Pistons can possibly get with the money of Rasheed and Iverson coming off the cap...|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	The coach IDK why they fired their last coach... he brought them to like 3 or 4 eastern conference finals...

6Mpi3Bgjaa	Physically...Melo has a lethargic approach, especially to the defensive end, he give absolutely no effort defensively except when it comes to rebounding, and even then he has the benefit of playing with Nene' and K-Mart which draw alot of attention on the defensive glass....Melo also is not adept to running his offensive sets effectively, which is partly why he is the only player with the Nuggets who hasn't adapted to playing with Chauncey Billups (his field goal pct is down to a paltry 43.7%)....plus he has a lazy release at times on his shot....Melo also will settle for a bad jumpshot many times and he even will take bad shots, perhaps wanting to give effort to be on that next level...lastly Melo doesn't pass the ball, and in turn he averages as many turnovers as he does assists, which means he forces the ball alot, he doesn't give it up and he can be turnover prone on occasion...    Overall Melo's biggest flaw is his mental toughness and leadership, he seems very soft in these areas and unfortunately these are qualities you hope players learn with time.....fortunatley for Melo he is still in his 6th season and we know he has plently of basketball left ahead of him so we'll see how he develops|`|52oWf2xMaa	All around game,look at lebron he is more of a triple double guy and even gets steals and blocks just like wade, bosh can score and rebound while Carmelo can just score, defense, team defense, I dont see it yet, maybe the thought of being the franchise player hasnt sunk in yet.|`|cdpW5aajaa	Who is Carmelo Anthony?|`|Xbid2OG8aa	speed and knowledge of game  other than that he is great  if he was faster and smarter he would be unstoppable  earlier this year he had 33 points in one quarter  most points ever scored in a quarter|`|uxregJ0faa	Where is his Defense at.

He can dunk and lay it up, even if he is fouled. However, while he does all this, he refuses to pass! Every time I see him get the ball, a shot goes up. Also, he's lazy on defense. He just stands there and waits for the shot to go up so he can go back on offense and score.

nAtBuBRhaa	Let's go through the first round...  1. Mario Williams - Thought he was a bust, turned out to be alright.  2. Reggie Bush - Most overrated player in the league, injury prone.  3. Vince Young - Just another player in the league, back-up.  4. D'Brickashaw Ferguson - Bust, another player in the league.  5.

Donte Whitner - Bust.  9. Ernie Sims - Lions Linebacker...need I say more?  10. Matt Leinart - Gonna have a good season, but not any time soon.  11. Jay Cutler - Thought he was gonna be a bust, now he's one of the best QB's in the league.  12. Haloti Ngata - Great player, underated because he is on that defense.  13. Kamerion Wimbley - Bust.  14. Brodrick Bunkley - Bust.  15. Tye Hill - Just another player in the NFL.  16. Jason Allen - Not that bad a player.  17. Chad Greenway - Bust.  18. Bobby Carpenter - Bust.  19. Antonio Cromartie - He's a really good corner.  20. Tamba Hali - He's alright, not the best.  21. Laurence Maroney - He had some good years, been overshadowed by Matt Cassell and Randy Moss.  22. Manny Lawson - Bust.  23. Davin Joseph - One of the best guards in the league.  24. Johnathan Joseph - Just another player.  25. Santonio Holmes - Gonna play a big role in the Super Bowl.  26. John McCargo - Bust.  27. DeAngelo Williams - Really good back, probably might be top 5 next year.  28. Marcedes Lewis - Bust.  29. Nick Mangold - Great player.  30.

Mathias Kiwanuka - Bust.|`|rC6RD8Wcaa	Colston had an injury year this year but is still solid and yea those other picks look really dumb now, everybody said Texans messed up when they took Mario ( I thought they couldnt go wrong with either Bush or Mario...I was wrong..... Texans were right)    your right those guys were viewed as players who were going to come in and be stars pretty quick and now Vince Young and Leinart are backups! Reggie Bush gets injured every year and is still just a punt and kick returner (and both their team played well this year)    Some other good players out of that draft that were drafted lower but have made more of an impact   DeMeco Ryans   Owen Daniels (Pro Bowl TE)  Mathias Kiwanuka   D'Qwell Jackson  Marcus McNeill|`|eIOlBzm8aa	What Hester and Washington do as much as Bush aka not much except return a punt. Leinart not really he dropped in the draft and he is still playing behind Warner. Bush is a bust and so is Young. Mario Williams is a stud.

No one said he was going to be good anyway.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	I agree with most of that besides Marques Colston. First he was a 7th round pick so that was a steal. Second he is better than average.

Laurence Maroney- Always injured  Jason Allen- Dolphins DB, never heard of him right??  16 pick..      However there are many bright spots    DeAngelo Williams- possible MVP??  Marcedes Lewis- One of the better tight ends in the game right now.  Joseph Addai- Great consistancy and overall fun player to watch with the ball in his hands  Haloti Ngata- Key d-lineman for a great Ravens D.  Antonio Cromartie- Shut down corner, next big name DB.  Nick Mangold- All-Pro center for the Jets.  Greg Jennings- All-Pro caliber WR for young Packers team.  Elvis Dumervil- Undersized but continuous motor and sack machine for the Broncos  Cortland Finnegan- Great 7th round steal for the Titans, we see what they did this year.  Marques Colston- Enough said, then again I could catch balls from Brees.    Overall it was not a bad draft, plenty of talent came and will continue to come from the 2006 draft. As a Raider fan I urge you to watch a young OLB by the name of Thomas Howard over the next year or so...

Proof would increase the cost of the item, as well as th condition of the ball.    But are people here saying that there won't be any scums out there that wouldn't pay scratch for it?    There are bums out there that would actually by it for a hefty price with no authentication of any sort. However, if you want to find a true value, get it authenticated. And don't sell it, keep it. It's an item everyone wants to have.|`|FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it on ValueJockey.com. It is free and a great place to find out the value of just about everything. Include a picture in the listing, it helps a lot.  http://www.valuejockey.com/|`|tvy8qFKCaa	Wow! Rare correct answers here.    You need a cert of authenticity otherwise the ball is worthless.     If it's verified, there is no one here who can tell you its worth, trust me. You'll have to have it valued by a professional. If it's real and certified, it would be in the thousands (but not millions like some people here have guessed in the past).

When we do all-nighters at my uncles property, i take that with me, and have a little kit filled with grips, scopes, extensions, sights and even a silencer.

NvaK57Phaa	just keep practicing. for hand strength, things that you can use are hand grippers, or you can just squeeze the football with your hands constantly. squeeze the football with both hands 20 times full strength for 10 seconds, and then do the same thing but with individual fingers on each hand (i.e. left thumb and left index finger, right thumb and right index finger at the same time, then switch to middle finger and thumb... etc.).     another drill you can do is called ball hunts. first, you hold the ball in one hand. without looking, spiral the ball up in the air, and catch the ball using your peripheral vision. do it 20 times on each side of your body. after that, do the same thing, but instead of using your peripheral vision, do a 360 spin as fast as you can and catch the ball before it hits the ground. soon, you should get good enough at this drill to be able to spin 2 times.    also, you can do some ball snatches. you toss the ball up into the air, and snatch it out the air with one hand vertically coming down on the ball before it hits the ground. do this 20 times each hand. fingertip pushups will also help    GOOD LUCK!|`|30LMCJrAaa	First hold your bong with your left hand and light it with your right. Then, switch off, hold you bong with your right and light it with your left.

ViZyM2AUaa	You can't really predict how much time spikes will take off of your time. It can't really be calculated because it differs between people.|`|AyoxEkRTaa	spikes take off a ton of time. just make sure you get distance spikes and not sprinting ones. they took off about a 45 seconds for me my first time using them.|`|M65Lu1GFaa	I would actually get flats. Spikes are good for  the rubber track, which usually lasts 1-10 mins but flats absorb the shock of an xc race, which usually lasts 15-2omins.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It is very difficult to say how much time spikes will improve your performance on a cross country course.  For the same reason road and cross country courses are only course records and not applicable to other courses is because they are different.  All you can say for sure is that spikes will improve your time over the same race without spikes.|`|Mya9LUxuaa	spikes can help but they don't run the race.   A great runner is great in any shoe.  That will be some feat if you break that time and if you do reach that level i don't think it will matter what kind of spikes you wear. good luck.
Y4mz8BShaa	@shattnerpossum: Faster target acquisition.    Yes. You need a mount on the side of the lower receiver, and a rail which attaches to the mount.    Without a mount, electrical tape?|`|U0Rvsabdaa	You can't mount it without a rail.     Personally I'd advise against buying one. A red dot won't really do anything more than your iron sights will.    Dmitri: I've never had any such problems with my iron sights, in airsoft or reality. If anything, I like iron sights more because they are easier to adjust.

5RgGnwiCaa	dont eat food or drink water like 45 minutes before you run  Im a junior in high school and i run cross country and track...when you run really hard sometimes you might just feel like puking.  you cant really stop that its just natural, it means you working really hard! good job!    and youll do fine on your pe testing! good luck!|`|oeHpTgRSaa	Well, if u DIDNT puke then you must already know how to anwser yourself. JK, don't eat much like within 2 hours of the run, drink water or gatorade (NO SODAS!!!). I run the 400m dash and mile relay and I usually eat alot in the morning or afternoon, at least 2-3 hours before my event. And whatever I do eat I try to get out asap. This works for me :D|`|FaqsLRJEaa	Don't over eat in the hours leading up to the run.  If you are hungry, try a granola bar or fruit.|`|AyoxEkRTaa	haha. my coach used to say that if you puke after your run, you know you ran it hard. try not eating anything an hour before your run, but just keep hydrated. running makes everything bounce and you get overheated and your stomach will eventually become upset. once your used to it , you wont throw up anymore.|`|bYmezw3Saa	Try not to eat or drink that much before a run|`|ZYVDj18Qaa	If you already ate within 45 minutes of running, than just press your tongue on the roof of your mouth as hard as you can. This keeps the throw-up down and works every time.     But you should avoid putting yourself in that position by not eating soon before running.|`|AA10241450	Great runners learn to run relaxed so practice letting go for instance of your clinched fists, biting your teeth or breathing hard - your lungs should have deep slow efficient breathes.  Also try to run the mile at the same pace or let the other kids lead the first three laps and then pounce at the end - preferably the last 200 meters.  Drafting off the other runners will save energy - let them fight the wind while you relaxed. If you don't want to puke the best way is actually to run some miles to get ready next time for the test.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	don't eat before hand
zcrJzVauaa	Im no expert on saltwater myself, i live maybe three hours from Charleston, but have never been.I usually like to fish the rising tide, from low to high, this brings alot of baitfish in. And where there are baitfish, there are bigger ones trying to eat them. The best way to learn is to find a good bait shop, there are guys who love to run their mouth in bait shops.Usually the owner will give you advice, and spill the beans on the hot spots. If you have any local piers, give them a call and see whats biting. They will have everything you need right there for whatever is biting. Im just not sure what runs anymore at what times, i mostly freshwater fish. But a day on the pier can be productive and there alot of people there who know what they are doing, and most love to share their wealth of knowledge. As far as the crabs go, they will eat about anything. I know when we used to live near Wilmington, N.C. we would just tie a raw chicken leg or neck to nylon twine, maybe a little weight, and throw it out in the water, periodically slowly dragging it in so not to lose the crab. You may want to check and see if that is legal down here.....some laws are different here than back home. Im sure if its legal, you can catch some nice blue crab with a little raw chicken in the traps. Be sure and leave the skin on and you can usuallly find some cheap thats about to go out of date. Dont worry, crabs dont care about freshness, lol.|`|0R46pYb3aa	Here's an article that might help:  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...
gBfPkdroaa	For sureee, i REALLY think that st. Louis has a good amount of potiential with Steven Jackson as their HB, i mean have you seen that guy run!? (i know you have) hes a beast when hes healthy.    2-14..psh i think they could be 7-9, or hopefully better.    it depends on who they draft, release, resign, Free agents, etc.    i hope tha rams do get better though.|`|c6q3EERdaa	They can't be much worse. I think Spags will be a good head coach, and if we get the right coordinators in place, I think the Rams will eventually return to their Greatest Show on Turf days. I'm only hoping, though.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Chris Long will be the greatest defensive end ever.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Yes. They must upgrade the offensive line and fix a defense that was generally porous; but they have the young talent on hand to improve. I was especially impressed by receiver Donnie Avery.    The Rams can win 7 or 8 games in 2009-perhaps more.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	One would have to believe they would.  If you look back at this season, the lost the lead in 5 games in the last few minutes and in two other games they had turn overs on thier final drives.  So its concievable that they could have won the NFC West just as easily as the Cardinals.  I can see 9-7 next year.|`|LtOxnF0kaa	No.Im from KC and I think that the chiefs will be better than the rams.The Truth.

7X1H2AfWaa	Suns already have jrich, nash, and grant hill, so why do they need ben gordon and larry hughes. both sides get good deals, but then robin lopez of the suns will have to step up at power forward, which will greatly effect the suns. because amare is a power forward, he and gooden can one of the best (maybe not as good as rashard and howard of the magic or gasol and bynum of the lakers) and amare can at least take them to the playoffs. they have a great bench which is effective. best part of trade goes to the chicago bulls.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	The Suns arn't that stupid.|`|lVPRQj9faa	The Suns would never trade Amare|`|amfGFzz7aa	This trade would just send the suns back in time to their old playing style, a style that fits Mike D'Antoni, not Terry Porter.|`|ziPiHdcHaa	Are you joking, The suns would have no big man thats good Shaq is to old to lean on that hard

Practices makes perfect. It might seem hard in the start but you will see improvement if you work hard. Also practise with a friend so you will know what to do when a 'man' is on you if you practices with a partner.    3.

Mo's good but he's not up to that all star level.  Melo should be starting over west. melo is sooooooo much better than west, that's y he was selected to play for the u.s. national team. the only reason shaq starts is because he's popular. al jefferson should start over him. he averages 25 points per game and 11 rebounds. shaq gets 17 points and 9 rebounds.

NFL football is played on sunday.|`|Bw5ZwYtPaa	In the past the most common day for football was on a Sunday, the day of rest, so guys sit back and watch the game as part of their relaxation. As more and more teams joined the league, they had to move some games to different nights, but as Sunday was the original day of football, it makes sense to have the Super Bowl on Sunday.    I think they should just make Monday a national holiday - everyone watches the game, even if they don't like football. :)

1jmXT4Vvaa	Last year I bought a 750 Kawasaki Brute Force.  I have been very pleased with the quality of the Kawasaki.  I can't think of a single complaint.  Top notch quality, and less expensive than a lot of the other companies out there.  For a 13 year old, a 450 is an awful lot of four wheeler.  I hope he has a lot of experience.  I would not let a 13 year old ride a 450 without very careful adult supervision.  It will have a top speed of about 60, and that is really hauling on a four wheeler.  I would look into maybe a 250 or there abouts.

One girl for our tryouts, wore a bikini and the coach immediately dismissed her before she even got in the pool. So it's not really a good idea, a firm one-piece with cap and goggles are your best bet.

sPiwb8Hraa	Live entertainment similar to the theatre.    Interesting and exciting to see humans challenge one another in a contact sport.

Interesting to see many different ways of running plays keeps the game exciting.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	1) You can enjoy watching it with only basic knowledge of the game, but there are so many layers of complexity in game planning. It's as much a chess match as it is a brawl.    2) With so many ways of catching up (onside kick, 2-pt conversion...), it rarely seems impossible for a team to come back until the final two minutes. The Bills coming back against the Oilers after being down 35-3 in the third quarter stands as proof.    3) There are great rivalries between teams in the same division or city. Aside from the Yankees and Red Sox, most of the biggest rivalries in professional sports are in the NFL. There are some teams who really hate each other, and their fans hate each other, and that just builds intensity for every game.|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	1.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...    Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com

RX5t6x6Haa	you got two different type tanks for a reason, co2 is for co2 only, HPA is the way to go although it might cost more, your gun'll be more accurate, and more air efficient,    co2= co2 tank  HPA=HPA tank|`|xfRwel49aa	Get compressed air a 72/45 tank can get you around 1500 rounds|`|X5W3leICaa	Co2 shoots co2 only.

s4VzPulYaa	Most likely no, if you are on a ASA team, usually they have all the equipment that you will ever need.  It does depend on the team, but I have never seen a team that didn't have "team bats" or bats that everyone can use. On the other hand, I have seen a few teams that get their own helmets so they don't have to share, and because it keeps the helmets a little nicer, but not very often, most teams have "team helmets" so that way everyone can use them.  Where I play softball, we have to wear the "team helmets" because they are all purple and black, so we all match when we get out to bat.   I'm pretty sure though, that your team will have extra equipment, and even if they don't have extras, someone on your team will probably let you use their helmet, or their bat.  you WILL need your own glove though.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	Try calling the organization and ask....all leagues are different....it really just depends which league you play for.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	I don't know that league in particular, but most baseball/softball leagues have helmets and bats that everyone uses.  Usually you bring your own glove.

Check out amazon see if you can find a headphone in your style, you don't want anything two pricey so that when you fall and break them you don't hate yourself. They also make some pretty sick helmets with headphones in the "ears". Good luck

WUuO6wbAaa	I don't know if ''respect'' is the word. If it were his choice, and he weren't involved in this whole mess, I'm sure he would prefer not to be involved. Honestly though, because Barry Bonds is so hated for juicing up, not to mention his demeanor, has allowed people to at least not hate this guy the same way how I'm sure Barry does. Does he deserve respect though? No. Just as someone mentioned, if it weren't for Barry being a multi-millionare, he'd give him up. Has Anderson been offered complete immunity? Would it prevent him from being sued by Barry if he gave him up? Anderson chose to take a stance, and for not going down, I can respect that. But the fact is, the position he's put himself in was too irresponsible on his own behalf to say I'd have respect for him.|`|nxymxSUFaa	Of course not.  The man is a fool for letting Bonds run his life.  Do you think for one moment that Bonds gives a crap about Anderson?  To do time for someone else's crime is down right insane.  Anderson should have come clean on day one and let the chips fall where they may.    Bonds is a liar and a cheat and needs to go to jail for his crimes.  No hall of fame for Bonds either.  His stats add up to "zero".    How can anyone respect absolute stupidity?|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Nope|`|wmYnJd2jaa	No. Spend a year in prison to protect Barry Bonds' reputation? That's stupid, not respectable.|`|lBhkWpDoaa	money talks baby.........or does it?       get it|`|fHxpycJSaa	I have absolutely ZERO respect for him. He won't have to work a day for the rest of his life when he gets out of jail, and in effect he's a drug dealer. Anabolic steroids are illegal unless prescribed and administered by a licensed physician. Greg Anderson is a dirtbag, just like his buddy, Barry Bonds.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	I think he's made it clear that he is NOT going to testify no matter what, and the more pressure the prosecution brings to bear, the more effort and money will be expended for nothing but more silence, a truly diminishing return. He's not gonna crack, so they're looking increasingly desperate as they keep trying to crack him.|`|gPtvKPqBaa	I have no idea who Greg Anderson is.|`|7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	I wonder if he would still keep his mouth shut if Bonds weren't a multimillionaire?
XUUDRM7yaa	First, get results that will attract attention and get your name in the spotlight.   Downhill is totally different than xc riding in about a hundred ways, so you'll need to learn how to do it safely and...fast.  Start winning races and getting podium finishes and pay attention to your times.....then compare them to the times of other pro racers and champions.  Lots of people kick the crap out of local competition and then get their butts handed to them when they compete at national events.....you really get to see how hard the competition is!   If you're successful and have the cash to travel around the country to races for a few years, then maybe someone will pick you up on their team.   A few companies are doing entry-level grassroots programs, too, so you might check into those.    http://www.sponsorhouse.com is another option where you can post a profile and see if anyone comes knocking.   But you have to start with race results.  You might visit the websites of bike companies you're interested in.....most of them have links (or FAQ's answers) to their sponsorship requirements and/or application forms.    There's a bunch more to it, but I'm not an expert on it by any means.   I guess one other very important aspect that you should keep in mind is that sponsors want you to represent them in the best light that they prefer.  Being professional, friendly, focused, and results-oriented will go a long way to being wanted.  There are people who are GREAT racers with hella skills, but nobody would want them as a company representative because of their crappy attitudes and/or questionable public behavior.       As for how long, nobody can tell you.  I mean, you have to develop your skills and results, and that takes time.  You could luck out and get some small level of sponsorship right off the bat, or you could be fighting courses for several years before someone chooses you or has an opening.

r6SMD7Qeaa	Yes, girls can play football, but just dont think that once you get out on the field that it will be a cake walk.  you will have to run, sweat, and hit with the guys.  Practices are tough, and injuries are going to happen.  Not trying to discourage you, if you want to go for it, but make sure you weight lift like crazy in order to be ready.  And, um unless you are like the kicker, injuries like mine in high school are possible.  I completely crushed by right index finger so it overlapped with my pinky finger, and finished practice, then had surgery, and was back in 4 weeks and finished the season with a full hand cast on my hand and had to snap the ball with my left hand.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Yes they can play can kick a$$ too|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It's not unheard of in high school, and I think there was one woman who kicked for a college team at one point. It's unusual though, and many schools don't allow it for safety and liability reasons. It's up to the school.    (edit:) Yes, it's technically discrimination, but they can give other reasons.|`|tlmBEAx4aa	depends on your school but if ur asking if girls can girls be able to play football and yes they can. girls rule!!!!!!!!!!|`|sZhTwzh4aa	yeah. you won't see many girls on the guys team-football is *obviously* a male-dominated sport, but you can totally do it.|`|7uYAus8laa	yes|`|EvDoLydgaa	sure they can|`|b14c397ce149f42761d8e20f0c575b9eaa	Yes they can, it is hard to do but they can't deny you|`|6KIsnVB6aa	yes you can. in my high school we had a girl play a few years back.    i also played tackle football in 1st grade and a junior high school team!|`|IqqciSgcaa	They can play flag football.|`|eKIyVGBmaa	I say go for it. I know a few girls who went out for football on the guys team  (and they were better than some of the guys)   if it makes you happy just do it and don't worry about what other people say.|`|oCYx6mWmaa	Well at my school they can't. Cuz its "to Dangerous". But at my neighboring school they have a powder puff league where we get enough girls together and play all the teams and have a tournment. Its fun.  Best bet is to just check it out and ask around or just go ask the coach!|`|yVnQ513Daa	It just depends on the high school, but one of my friends did play on the football and she was a great running back....    BEST WISHES..AND GOOD LUCK ON THE TEAM=)|`|qWNdhGVXaa	I'm not sure if they'll allow that.  I'm sure you can play, but the guys on the other side would probably have problems tackling a girl|`|AA10420446	Boy , girl doesn't really matter these days at least not in my home town. If you got the Talent than you can play. If you don't then no..|`|3onacSoxaa	i do not think so, but you can try|`|LXoM2p5paa	Yeah you could play football.Here where I live,there was a girl who played football for a high school,and she was pretty good.    The coaches cant tell you that you cant play just because your a girl.That's discrimination,and schools can get in trouble for that.    So give it a try.|`|oXMrr0ggaa	of course girls can.We have played it a lot with  other guys! So go ahead and play girls.

EDIT: You didn't mention range, but since ethical hunting range for a 30-06 is 400 yards, you really don't need an amazing super scope. If you were target shooting at 1000 yards you would be interested in a totally different type of scope and price.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Go here for best buy.*  Traditions.com.....|`|NN4lnWYEaa	I bet you can hardly zero your rifle @ 100  yds with that 1.5-4.5 rifle scope anyway i recommend Nikon coz it's got the best clarity in it's class no doubt but i would recommend bdc reticle coz 30-06 can shoot 500-600 yds so why not get the one that can help you push your bullet up to that range as well as cover short range too without any mathematical correction.There will be wind correction on longer ranges but a simple study about wind correction should fulfill your   30-06 performance.and if you want to get the regular scope try to avoid the one with fine crosshair reticle coz you will barely see your plus while aiming at low light conditions.Good Luck !!|`|uWpwXn6paa	I have a Trophy Bushnell scope that is good for the price, but if you want a very good one I recommend a Leupold. Tasco and Simmons are the cheapest in more ways than one.|`|BFBEOJsvaa	A Burris scope will fit in your price range. I have used one for a few years on an ultra lightweight magnum rifle and it has held a zero. It is also made in the USA, not Asia if it matters to you. You can check them out at http://www.bearbasin.com/|`|5b7326092beef0175c7b5933a2d6540daa	Bushnell's are good|`|YexYU5LRaa	Nikon buckmasters and the Leupold rifleman scopes are very good for around $200 bucks.
Cb5N6UaQaa	I find the article to be very offensive and unproffesional by his part. You shold not threat your media brothers like that. You can critize all you want but he was straight up bashing them. I will not go into detail defending each case but some one should go after him after that.|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	I agree with most of them but not all.|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Just agreed on his comment with Dookie Vitale, guy is nuts about anything Duke basketball.

Those people are proffesionals for a reason. The Blogger can say what he wants, it's opinions and will get views and talk out of it, but it's just opinions.
H3nbC71eaa	It was better than his others, but all he really did is calm down in this promo now that he's a heel, he wasn't as hyped up, or trying to be like he was as a face. But it worked, the things he was saying, and saying them at the pace he was made his promo more dramatic. I'd say better, but we'll see in the long run how his heel promos progress.|`|T13xM9iJaa	I think that his promo was really great and is just showing how dark and evil he could be his accent even sound different|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I thought he did fine. I always said he was better as a heel.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Better his promo this week on Smackdown! were good and nice.|`|1ead85402698581b0818d3b4314aeaf9aa	Way better than Jeffro's.|`|aWVZb2Pgaa	Awesome!

zr4tfa8Aaa	depends what you or someone else is into|`|onkUcy19aa	I agree with you. If a no holds-barred fight is done, an MMA fighter could easily beat a boxer.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Good point. I think a basketball player will beat a football player in basketball and a football player will win on the field|`|ujT5teZgaa	Considering 99% of MMA fighters take a form of stand up I wouldn't be to sure. Whether it be American Kick-boxing or Muay Thai or just boxing.|`|S0N3BRecaa	Actually there's a lot of star studded boxers gone MMA in the UFC. Some of the fighters in the UFC could beat boxers.|`|L2UUj2hjaa	Thanks for spreadin it.|`|ewlVffW1aa	a critisism with a lot of mma fighters is that with their footwork they could not beat a boxer[ not that boxing champions care they are fine in their world]   this argument  on both side has ppl into mma because all these mma ppl try to say that they have complete combat and everything so they thus state it is better then boxing[ in my oppinion it is] however we must bear in mind boxing does not claim to be total combat it is 9its own sport and fine one in that respect\|`|FpJ2qvrCaa	being that i am a huge sports fan and I love MMA and Boxing its pretty annoying to compare the two disciplines because they both have too many differences. I do think that in a street fight an MMA fighter would whoop up on a boxer just for the simple fact that they are more well rounded fighters the fact that they know how to do kicks, punches, elbows, knees, submissions, and takedowns would give them an automatic advantage, even though the boxer would have a punchers chance. That being said people should still respect both sports and take it for what it is.

I think its hella funny to see a new profile but kinda is getting old. so yea i hope i helped
AA11694178	When you put the words "cheap" and "Barrett .50 cal. rifle" in the same sentence, you form an oxymoron.  There is no such thing as a cheap Barrett rifle.  For current prices, check out www.barrettrifles.com or www.gunbroker.com.  You will find that you will have to pull about $9,000 out of your mattress in order to bring one of these babies home.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	$7000-$10,000, nowhere's cheap, especially for the M82,  since it's being bought out of production by the military, private sales are few and far between.  your better off getting a Grizzly big boar .50, around $2000-4000 depending on demand and dealer. a lot less threatening looking to the cops and still a very fine rifle, it's actually the one that's used on the tremor movies.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	I know where there is one for sale.  It isn't new, but has never fired. includes case and four additional magazines (five total) for $9,500.|`|AA11729094	You're a gun collector and don't know what prices barrets are going for?    REALLY???????    You realise airsoft doesnt count as guns right?  Neither does nerf, water, or paintball.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	well on the Barrett website they're listed for $8,999 base w/o a scope.  Cheap...try a gunshow i guess, or gunbroker.com|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Well, there is no such thing as a Barret sniper rifle, in any caliber.     There's a Barret .50 caliber anti-materiel rifle, and that goes for about $8000-$9000, last time I checked.     Check your closest farming cooperative or sporting goods store.|`|dpSr0icwaa	$8,000|`|9QHwLQEraa	I've seen a Barrett m107 on gunbroker.com for $15,000. Hope this helps|`|TBAfpnmgaa	You can find them for around $10,000 if you want a real one. But I bet a real gun collector like you would prefer the Airsoft version.

Also Mexico's players are not doing so well especially their strikers and some defenders are injured. So USA should defeat Mexico. No offence (on Mexicans) i think they will play for the tie yet i just hope it be a great game!|`|JKs0lkRgaa	many Mexican play in big club in Europe, i think they'll win the game|`|9eb33211855ac6b8bfc95a8961dc3f76aa	U.S. 3-1

I'd even take Osorio before him.|`|4ETDsRu6aa	yeah they should take him instead of players from chivas|`|AA10372216	i think he should kuz he is a great defender....all u ppl sayin that he shouldnt kuz he made us lose FRIENDLY  GAMES stfu! kuz everyone makes mistakes|`|jlyznmwSaa	Me ests oyendo, intil?|`|TT3q5an1aa	no he cost us the goal against Sweden by trying to juke a forward instead of clearing out the ball from danger|`|rU7wkGp4aa	Nope, he's sucked when he's been given the chance.

e7uUfLsqaa	stretch stretch stretch!  There are many ways to stretch, but you can start my going into the best split you can do, and hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds. Then do other side.  Take deep breaths and as you exhale, relax even more into the stretch, that helps alot. (make sure your front knee is pointing up, don't twist to the side, you could injure yourself)    Look online for other kinds of stretches, too many for me to list....    But do at least 3 times per week - muscle memory has a short lifespan :)    good luck!|`|SiPGcBnYaa	do lots of lunge stretches every day. slide down as far as you can while holding your back knee straight and hold for at least a minute. you can also use a resistance band tied to your ankle and do kicks while lying on your back. if you do these exercises consistently you should get your splits in time.|`|1ZuRzD5Faa	take dance  or acro  or gymnastics of some sort  or at least just do half split (all 4 sides), middle oversplit, right split, left split, frog stretch, butterfly stretch (be sure to push your knees down all the way), and other similar stretches every night (or morning)  as a matter of fact just do the splits whenever ur not doing anything (like when youre watching tv, sit in the splits. doing homework? sit inthe splits against the wall, it gets you used to the position)|`|5d69a2b5acd5128b7f6ba155c12e4e78aa	Buy the book, 'Relax into Stretch'. The author teaches you how to learn the splits safely and effectively!|`|SjNpWwSfaa	When you are young your bones are soft, so you can easily do it. Oh yeah Practice a lot so it won't hurt that much|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Stretch Allot Then After You get Really Flexible It Should Be Easy|`|73380f4f046c754e124ea1369d29812faa	Everyday stretch till you hit your limits, do this for a week. Then the next week go down 1/2-1 inch lower, hold this till however long you can. Go down 1 inch more every week till you can do the splits.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	you know how you stretch? like spread your legs apart as far as you can. and keep going down by sliding until you can't go any further without it hurting. then you put your hands on either side of you to support yourself and bounce for 2 minutes. do this every day twice. and you should be going down further and further. (: just like stretching.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	A lot of stretching and taking it easy as not to hurt yourself.    http://cheerleading.about.com/od/gymnast...  http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Split|`|ZinT6tkZaa	yea...u should buy the books|`|jOZhUTMWaa	The only way you can get down in all three splits is to STRETCH.  stretch  when you watch tv..when youdo your hw...when you talk on the phone. wen ever you have free time, and youll  be surprised how easy it will come, trust me.   (its also important to hold a stretch for atleast 30 seconds, or else your muscles nd whatev act as a rubberband---if you pull them nd then let go right away, it snaps back even tighter..but if you hold it, it will stay stretched out)|`|VOVjebIoaa	I know this saying gets totally old, but practice really does make perfect. Every night hold each of your splits for at least 30 seconds each. If you do it for a shorter amount of time, the stretch is worthless. Good luck! Just keep stretching and they'll eventually come. Be persistent!|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Stretch. I couldn't do them before but now i can. Try to do them by stretching your muscles. DON'T OVERSTRETCH! Stretch a little more everyday and eventually you will be able to do them.|`|YJcd8OAeaa	you dont really learn as you do practice. split ur legs as far as you can without hurting yourself/ barley hurting yourself. then once youve done that enough go lower and practice there. so on and so forth. eventually, youll get there.
AA11441385	It can't be.  Look at the people who have already succeeded.|`|VSqk5zpnaa	It depends on how determined you are to learn it. For example, I went snowboarding for a week at some resort in Vermont or something like that it was 3-4 years ago. I have been skateboarding prior to snowboarding for about 6 years and it did not really help me at all. I took the lessons they gave at the place but I was pretty pathetic but it really depends how much you put into it. A lot of curving and stuff which is kind of tough for me.|`|N3qc36Ataa	Yes.|`|7otyLHwCaa	Depends, really. Some people have a hard time getting the feel for it, and some people, like me, just picked it up very quickly, for whatever reasons. This could include other experience you have in surving, skateboarding, etc., that could help you get used to snowboarding easier. Other than that, it's just practice, practice, practice, and some advil, I guess. You WILL fall, most likely a lot, everyone does, so it's not a problem, it's actually part of the learning. When you fall, you learn what not to do, and remember not to do that thing again, or make sure you work on that skill more. Snowboarding may be uncomfortable at first and frustrating in the beginning, but once you get comfortable with the whole deal (which shouldn't take more than 4-6 days of riding), it will be very easy to get better and better, and then you'll have loads of fun. So keep with it, it's definitely worth it. Good luck dude!|`|Fl1MqgJRaa	well, like everyone is saying it depends... if you are a quick learner, then you should be able to at least grasp the concept. Snowboarding is one of those things that has to "click". One thing that you have to rememeber is pressure is good. Your edges are your saving grace and pretty much how you do everything on a board. If you just slide your board you'll get no where. You have to lift up and use pressure.    Also, you can't give up. It's very frustrating, and you will fall... a lot, but once ya get the hang its a lot of fun and definately worth your time and effort. =] have fun and keep going at it|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	practice makes perfect.  its not hard you just need to spend time with it, and u will get good.  i did both skiing and snowboarding skiing was harder for me, i switched to boarding 2 yrs ago and i like it so much better, but i think snowboarding was easier for me only cuz i really wanted to do it and i had skiied before.|`|Unaaay0Caa	yes it is very hard at first. i've heard from a lot of people its harder then they expected but honestly stick with it and its worth it. my first year was just learning the basics. my second year everything just clicked & i was actually going up to the park. your first time you are going to fall a lot, trust me lol. you just gotta be determined to get right back up and try again. you should invest in some lessons. they really help teach you the basics. also it all depends of your time and effort. i go up almost every weekend & only go in the lodge for lunch and bathroom breaks so that could also be why i picked it up quick. another thing is your natural athletic ability if you play certain sports & are balanced that could help contribute. another key thing is dont get mad or scared it just messed you up. you gotta realize it will take time but it the end its well worth it. i love snowboarding now, if i go a week without boarding my life feels incomplete haha    heres actually a funny video of someones first time =) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsPdZAHYm...|`|AyoxEkRTaa	yea. the first time you'll be on your face the whole time. the second time you'll have it down though. like you dont want to go fast, but it is way easier to board when you've got some speed. just dont give up your first time.

r6SMD7Qeaa	I would suggest having it checked by a doctor.  its better to have it checked and be able to play later, than never again. trust me, I completely crushed my right index finger in high school during practice, I made myself finish practice cause I just had been brought up varsity my sophomore year, but found out that it was a 5 weeks injury and needed surgery.  I am now playing in college.  so yeah, it could be a bone bruise, that has never healed, or it could be a stress of and actual fracture. Its not a ACL or MCL cause that is in your knee, not your thigh.|`|4EN1srnVaa	This exact same thing happened to my friend. He was a quarter back and got sacked by a guy that was like 245. but anyway ended up he had a torn ACL. its an important muscle in your leg. But if you dont get it looked at it could be bad. and your leg will be weak for a long time. my friend injured his in the fall, rounded a base in baseball in the summer hit it wrong and it almost tore it again thats how weak itll make your leg.so i would get it checked out.|`|ZE8Bm4Deaa	I dont interested to suggest u.  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|LGD4mTrYaa	Best thing to do is well obviously let your parents or guardian what's going on. If you are afraid to go to the doctors or something just know that if you don't go and you did do something to it, it's only getting worse and if it gets really bad then you may not be able to play sports again.
