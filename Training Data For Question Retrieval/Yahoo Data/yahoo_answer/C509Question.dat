20090220220154AA1zMN2	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I'm being laid off and I have 1 mo. of health insurance left. I have an HSA. How do I use my $1,100?	My health savings account has $1,100.00 in it, and as I read it, you need to use the money for health related causes. Now, I could buy $1,100 worth of vitamins at the drugstore and resell them, but that doesn't seem practical. I've already been to my primary care physician, even had a blood test and a chest x-ray for a cough, but how to I get to that other $ without it going to waste?

I've been experimenting with tampons and pads, and I like tampons a lot better. Anyway, this afternoon I put a tampon in and it was kind of difficult to put in, kind of like it was dry. So about 4 hours later I take it out and there is little blood on it. I put a pantyliner on and no blood for hours. But I go to the bathroom and after I peed a huge amount of blood just spilled! I was so frustrated! I thought it was over with! And I put an overnight pad on 30 minutes ago and it's already filled up a lot! Does this usually happen first-time? Please help! Thanks!

I'm not pregnant, I've taken a test, so that rules that out. I'm positive it's not an STD, but I did awhile ago have an ovarian cyst on my right side...it's around the time of my period, but no blood, only dark brown discharge...only when I have a tampon in though...I'm scared it's something serious, but it's only hurt the time around my period, nothing else. I went to the ER last month for a sharp pain in my upper right hand side, and everything was normal, they said the cyst may have just burst (I didn't know it was so painful!) They said blood tests were perfect and nothing was wrong. Also, about 6 months ago I had a pap smear done and everything was normal. A little less than 6 months I guess. Could it be just another cyst forming, my mother and grandmother have had issues with them, and they said I'm bound to get them....?! Please, any advice. I just get so worried about it being cancer or anything like that. i havent had nausea, no fever, no random body aches, nothing of the serious sort, just pelvic pain around my period time, different from cramps though...it's hard to explain...please help me...i'm honestly scared I won't be able to have kids..please.

I just dont want to waste time, money, most importantly life for something i am NOT in love with . I am not sure if i have a passion for music or if i want to so bad because there is no one else i can turn to for support. Am I forcin myself to like music I dont know but I feel so DEEP intertwined with music. I love it. When I listen to Music the sound of a piano and guitar makes everything in me shutters. when I get in my vulnerable mood I can write poetry forever to express myself. Music puts me in a place i cant explain. I often compare myself to other artist and find I am very similar personality wize. I am very insecure and find my self often thinking are you serious you think you can make it as an artist and I almost laugh at myself. when im in the mood nothing could shift my mind from beliveing I belong to the public. I belong there because ive never belinged to anything or anyone else. Should I try and pursue My music?

I had a helmet on and I am an experienced rider but I've never fallen like this before. I fell and slammed the back of my head on the snow. It felt like I didn't have a helmet on that's how hard I hit it. I got up and went back to work because I had to. I was still dizzy at 5ish but the blurry vision went away.  My mom took me to first aid. They suggested going to the hospital but my mom said no. I went home and slept from 7pm to 7am. My ma woke me up. Then i fell asleep till 5pm tonight.      All I want to do is sleep, my head has not stopped hurting since I fell. I get dizzy after walking a long time. I think I have a concussion but I don't know because my mom wont take me to the hospital. Im 16 so I cant drive to it and its in Albany an hour away. I don't wanna go to work tomorrow but shes making me.       So, is this normal? Do i have a concussion?

I looked it up online and more specifically, I'm experiencing 'subjective vertigo'. (When objects around victim appear to be moving, even while the victim may be sitting or standing still). I get these at night, sometimes before dinner, sometimes in the afternoon (around like 2/00) and every morning after I walk like half a block to my bus stop. When I stop walking, the road looks like it's growing towards me. Other times, things appear just to be shifting, like I'm on a boat or something. (Right now my head just feels very heavy and a little numb and I'm getting that 'boat' feeling again.) This has been going on for a little over a month now. Now I'll be honest..I haven't been eating. I eat lunch and dinner, but no breakfast. I just never thought it would have this much effect. But I'm not blind, I can see that now. I just wanna know exactly what to eat and how big my breakfast needs to be. Last time this I did this, I started fainting after like 3 weeks and as often as 2x a week. I ate breakfast for about two months and that was only because my Mom got up with me..to make my breakfast..to make sure I ate! I don't eat breakfast because I am grossed out by the idea of eating right when you wake up for some reason (Well after you shower and brush your teeth of course, haha). And because I just do not like eating in the morning. It has nothing to do with my weight. My real question is; What exactly should I eat in the morning so I don't feel this way? And does it have to be big? Thanks in advance!

20090220171027AAmEDtq	Health;Mental Health	Do you think I'm going insane?	I can't sleep until very late at night.   I dream about weird and obscure things.   I sometimes hear people (involved in my life) saying random things to me, even when they're not there.   I can't stick to rules or routine, I actually find it impossible.   Sometimes I'll be walking down a street or lying in bed or watching TV when I all of a sudden think that life is just a dead end or that I'm failing at everything.   No self-confidence at all.   I can't help but feel that people are talking behind my back.   I can't ever seem to do things right and when I **** up I get angry.   I sometimes feel the need to punch something.    I impersonate people and repeat certain phrases to the point of being sick of it (my friends actually challenged me to not impersonate a certain person for just a half hour and I failed after 12 minutes).   I always wake up late.   Sometimes I feel compelled to just leave the house and walk for a few hours, even in the middle of the night.   I like to obsess over pointless details.   I can't help but feel that I'm often ignored by people.   I get a kick out of being uncooperative and watching people suffer.      All of these signs make me sound so weird but I feel fine. My life is pretty good most of the time. I don't know why I do these things. It's not that I hate myself or my life. I may feel like everything is fine but maybe it's time I got a second opinion. Maybe I'm just having a bit of a mental crisis where sometimes my mind will battle with itself and then other times I'm perfectly normal. Oh I don't know. Someone please explain what I'm thinking.

20090220175747AAuZEeQ	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Severe pain not being treated, unethical?	I am a 24 year old female. I have experienced excuciating back and leg pain since August of 2008. In December 2008, a CT L-Spine showed a disc protrusion in L5-S1 narrowing the left nerve root foramen greater than 50%. Despite conservative measures, the severe pain continues. An MRI in January of 2009 showed multi-level degenerative disc disease and "significant neural foraminal narrowing on the left, with near complete obliteration of the foramen."  My GP and a pain management doctor have failed to prescribe me any narcotic pain medications at this time; despite any valid reason not to. Don't I have a right as a patient to relief from this incapacitating pain? How should I handle this matter? I feel I am being treated inhumanely.

20090220194657AAy9A4E	Health;Diet & Fitness	What's Wrong With Me?	Okay, so the day before yesterday, I was running and started getting a cramp. My legs were a little sore, but on my right side right above my hip bone, I began getting pangs of pain. I figured it was just like any other cramp. After track, it became harder just to walk. I was almost like limping, but it could've been my legs being sore. Either way, whenever I lifted my right leg to take a step, the right side of my waist hurted a lot. Massaging it helped, but I can't go around massaging it all the time. The day after that, I was limping a little. It hurt to walk and get up or make sudden movements regarding my right side. Track after school wasn't too hard, it hurt a little, but I was able to run alright. And now, today, I did my warm ups, and I ran a whole 350-Meter lap. I felt alright after, and rested for about 15 minutes. Then I got up to do more running, and my side hurted like hell! I began to sprint and my side hurted so much I almost knocked myself over. I really can't run now because it hurts sooo much!         Some notes to take:   > I'm in track, so for the past four weeks I have been going to 2-hour practices five days a week. The past weeks, I was doing fine even though I felt really sore each practice.       > I haven't really ate lunch for the past few days... could this be the explanation? I didn't eat because I was too busy to think about eating.     I ate probably hot cheetos or some peaches, but not a lot like I used to before...      > I'm not on my period so is it correct to describe it as a cramp?      What's wrong with me? And if you know, can you give me tips? I really hope it's not anything serious! It's been getting better, and I stopped limping today, but sprinting was what really killed me. I could NOT sprint after I sprinted the 350Meters (which didn't hurt). Please help!!

Usually people who lack social skills are highly intelligent to compensate. I am not good at either. I am failing all my classes.       Why am I horrible at everything I do? Why am I not good at anything? Will I ever fit into society?

20090220185716AA7cKqJ	Health;Mental Health	Klonopin for anxiety?	I have social anxiety and have difficulties in social situations. My anxiety isn't so bad that I'm unable to live a normal life. I am able to, but it's just during social situations like going to dinner with a group of strangers, or speaking up in class, etc.       I heard really good things about Klonopin and how they feel calm after they take it. So, I got a prescription for it and tried it for the first time today. It was a relatively low dosage.       But instead of making my feel calm or whatever it is suppose to do, it made me extremely dizzy and nauseous. It worked within half an hour of my taking it. When I took it I was sitting down at my desk, but when I got up an hour or so after taking it, I nearly fell down. It was like I couldn't stand or walk straight for the next few minutes.       Is this normal? Should I continue taking it? or stop? It really wasn't a good experience at all.       Has this happened to anyone else taking this medication?      Thank You

20090220194502AAGzO8J	Health;Mental Health	I feel like I'm the only one grieving for her.?	I guess you could call me a care giver, i work with young adults who are medically fragile. Let's call her Sara. Sara was 25 years old, she died last week of pneumonia, she had developmental problems from a young age, (Rett Syndrome) so she looked like she was 12, and she had the mind set of a toddler, also didn't have the ability to walk talk or eat. (fed through tubes) She was a beautiful little girl, bright blue eyes, adorable smile, and I felt like I had a special bond with her I could always maker her laugh, I was helping to take care of her for the last two years along with other staff members. I seriously loved her like a daughter, i know that sounds a little strange. When she passed away I was devastated, couldn't stop crying.   But it seems like everyone else at work doesn't care...they carry on as if nothing has changed, they just gathered up all of her things and set them in her room for her mom and family to pick up this weekend. (She lived in a house with three other medically fragile adults)...   I feel like I'm not allowed to grieve for her...like it would be unprofessional or something, but i feel like i'm dying on the inside, like a piece of my heart was torn out and i don't know how to deal with it.   Any advice?

20090220182911AAMaBxt	Health;Other - Health	Why do I wake up paralyzed?	7 years ago I began sometimes waking up paralyzed.  I sometimes wake up, unable to open my eyes or move or speak, no matter how hard I try.  It's quiet terrifying waking up paralyzed especially when I'm lying face down so am unable to breath properly.  But, this is where it gets weird, well it used to, anyway.  Because the first few times this happened to me,  I thought that I had a demon on my back.  Now, I'm not a religious person or a superstitious person, but the first few times it happened, I thought that a demon was siting on my back and rubbing and blowing my back.      When the paralyzing effect wore off and I was able to move again I looked and as you would expect, there was no one there.  Also, the very first time this happened as well as thinking there was a demon on my back I thought that I could see a demon across my room.  He or it was about 7 feet tall, after a little while, that image just faded away.      Some time after having these experiences I watched a TV show in England, called "The Richard And Judy Show" and on that show they were having a discussion about people from hundreds of years ago(I think maybe Medieval Times, although I could be wrong about the time)and they said that some of the people from that time reported that they had woken up paralyzed and believed that demons were sitting and doing things on their backs, the exact same thing I had experienced.  What on Earth would make people experience something like that?      Nowadays when it happens to me, I don't imagine demons are on my back or in my room, I just wake up paralyzed, which is terrifying enough on it's own.  What causes this?

20090220191201AApTM5r	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Should I see a doctor or a chiropractor?	I am 25 and have a very physical job that requires heavy lifting, and standing on a concrete floor.  Recently I have began having joint/muscle pain.  My knees, hips, and shoulders ache constantly.  Also my lower back to the point that my legs ache and tingle and it feels like my hips are separating.  My body feels tense even after a full night sleep I do not feel rested.  If I sleep on my side I wake with my shoulder and/or hip feeling separated to the point that it takes 20-30 minutes for the pain to stop so I can be comfortable enough to go back to sleep.  I feel like old people who always complain about their aches and pains must feel.  Should I see a chiropractor or a doctor for x-rays or the like?  I know physical labor takes a toll on your body, however 3 years isn't really enough time to totally wear down all your cartilage is it?  The only thing I can attribute to the sudden change is that I worked through my entire pregnancy, but the pain didn't start until after I returned from maternity leave and that was 6 months ago.  Any suggestions?

It's also made me really focused on my physique, I probably have anorexia, but it's made me lose 30% of my body weight, so now I'm really thin. It's making me strive to look better, and behave better. I realized that even though it makes me feel really crappy, it makes other people like me more as I'm trying to become better. Is it really normal to feel like this? The way I see it, there's so many upsides and downsides, but I can't seem to find the proper way to go. My doctor called me anorexic today, and it freaked me out for a while, but everyone is saying I look a lot better, and have a great personality which makes it all worth it. I've also noticed that I actually try to bring on waves of depression more frequently, as in a few times a day, because they kind of motivate me? How normal would this be?

There were 63 in my area (Sarasota, Fl) so i try to narrow the results..      I can choose either a gyno or a gyno-ob. Would the regular gyno be more likely to be poorer quality since they aren't also an ob? (I'm 18 and not planning on being pregnant anytime soon.)      I can choose "Board Certified" and/or " Recognized for a Commitment to Quality". I get no results for the latter choice.

My mother has been ill for about 3 months or so now,  i noticed a rash on her thigh about the same time ago  and she has seen so many doctors about many symptoms she has gotten so far. , she got the flu , joint pain in the knees, tingling in the hands pain in the arms swelling in the feet and lots of water retention, she also complained of anxiety and palputations which doctors blamed on the many meds they have been giving her.    She has so far been diagnosed with...carpo tunnel, rheunatoid arthritis, depression, shoulder to hand syndrome,  congerstive heart failure due to a possible clot, chronic fatigue, and has been given a whole array of meds including steroids and vit D which i think help the bacteria grow.  I live in the philippines where no one seems to think that Lyme is present, i have made so many calls and no one seems to believe me, i  really think she may have lyme disease, but no one listens, i need to find a specialist that is willing to  consult, plese if u think this is lyme,  could u point me in the right direction. She is normally very healthy, so i dont believe she can have all these symptoms without a more plausible explanation. thank you

Does it make any difference from anyone else that I can remember things CLEARLY from when I was 2 years old, but not be able to remember anything about yesterday? Not even if I try really hard - I've asked people what happened the day before, and even after they describe it, I won't remember or be familliar with anything they're saying. Yet I can tell several things that seem to me to be not so long ago...for example I had a memory that I was replaying to my mother, and when I said "Yeah...wasn't I like, 9 when that happened?" She said "Um, no....you were 2."      Does this mean anything, and if so, what should I be saying to my doctor, or looking for? 'Cause it really sucks when you can't come home and tell your mom how your day went.

20090220191032AAR8mDf	Health;Women's Health	Telling Boyfriend You Have PCO?	I just recently a few months ago found out that I had PCO. Since then I've kinda ignored it and not thought about it so much. My doctor put me on Yasmin birth control pills so I could regulate my periods and also help the hair growth. My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now. He cares a lot about me and we even plan on marrying each other and having children hopefully someday. He knows that I'm taking birth control pills but isn't fully aware why. He thinks I'm just taking them because we're sexually active. When I found out that I have PCO I told him that my doctor put me on birth control and I can't get pregnant but if I want to I have to take other pills..I feel like I'm hiding this from him. And can't go through dealing with this alone anymore. I haven't told him yet. And seems like I take my anger out on him that I have this lately. He's confused and thinks he's done something wrong since I just keep getting mad him about the littlest things and then apologizing after. It's an easier solution than telling him why I have all this anger but it's not right.       That's why this weekend I plan on telling him. I just don't know how he'll react and I'm a little scared he'll leave me. But I'm positive that he loves me and will accept it. But at the same time how do I bring it up and explain it to him?

Okay, so it went away after that. Now, on Valentines day, I was with my boyfriend in the city about to go out to eat at Chevy's, and I had another episode. I felt like I was taking a hot shower and the water just turned ice cold, and that feeling of being able to breathe but in a gasping way, just came to me. It didn't stop. I was feeling weak, I was stumbling and I felt like I was gonna faint. My heart was beating so fast, and I felt like I was in another world. Everything felt so unreal, my boyfriend was so scared and he called my mom. These episodes last for about 2 hours and always happen around midnight.   It happened again last night.   I went to the hospital.   They said it sounds like an anxiety disorder, and they said I should see a therapist. I know for a fact that it's not this, I don't know what it is, but I know it's not this.

Okay basically I have been doing 5x5 workout program for a month or two now and it seems as though I can not really add 5 pounds to my lifts anymore so I thought I would change up my routine.  I need to gain some lean hard mass to move up in hockey and since it is just spring hockey right now I have more time to hit the gym and I also felt kinda embarrassed tonight when my grandpa was talking about how was a 6'0 190 pound football player and I'm nothing near that.  And he was lean too but any way's here is my program now.  I just am mainly going for strength but looking bigger wouldn't hurt either but I can also not gain fat with this because I play hockey and need to be in shape.   Monday: 5x5 bench, 5x5 military press, 5x5 barbell rows   Tuesday: cardio (so I don't gain fat cuz of hockey)   Wednesday: push ups, sit ups dips, strength stuff   Thursday: Cardio   Friday: 5x5 deadlifts, squats and leg press (making good gains with these so maybe should keep it   So does any one actually have a program to help me gain much needed strength?  BTW I do NOT want to be a bodybuilder so a split routine will probably not be a good option.

20090219104754AA6KWu7	Health;Other - Health	How can you get rid of no see ums/can't see ums in the HOUSE?	An older lady at the mother's morning out that I work at is being driven crazy by something biting her and her husband in their house. Since the fall she has had little bite marks on her skin...everywhere. This morning the crease and inside both forearms was one basically one giant pinkish purplish rash and looked very inflamed.      She went to the dermatologist a few weeks ago who said yeah, these spots all over her body are inflamed and he gave her some $80 cream to rub over her body which hasn't helped. She said they are EVERYWHERE in her house..sort of a light brownish tiny bug which she showed me a few weeks ago. They have had the house fumigated twice, used all kinds of bug spray and powders, you name it. She washes her clothes in hot hot water and dries them on high heat...hasn't helped. She managed to catch a dead one and gave it to a friend who works at the agriculture dept, but they can't really look at it now b/c of the peanut butter thing going on here (in Georgia). Exterminators can't kill them and think she's crazy. Her co-workers think she's crazy (except me). Her primary care doc and the dermatologist thinks she's crazy. She's assuming they are can't see ums bugs. She has lost weight since the outbreak in her house and thinks her kidneys are acting up. I guess she was told by someone that the bugs/bites can affect your kidneys. She said she vacuumed last night which she thinks stirred them up and she got bitten worse last night which caused the huge inflammation on her arms I saw today. I told her to go to the hospital but she said she'd wait to go to her doctor again tomorrow (who already thinks she's crazy)      Can anyone suggest a way to get rid of them in her house?

Mid-day snack: An Odwalla chocolate protein bar   Lunch: Salad w/ no cheese, minimal dressing   Dinner: Steamed vegetables w/ fruit juice      I am a vegetarian. My exercise has consisted of 150-200 sit-ups per night, and plenty of physical activity on my mother's ranch chasing cattle on foot, building fences, etc.. (Around 2-5 hours a day.) I am very strong physically. My legs look GREAT and my butt is very toned, but my breasts and my stomach/abs are very.. flabby.

Could someone please tell me anything I could do to improve myself, or maybe offer some explanation as to why I can't drop the pounds? Thanks,      Devon

They set me up with another appointment to actually see the psychiatrist, which isn't until the beginning of MARCH... and they said the therapist would call between that appointment and the psych appointment and I haven't heard ANYTHING>>> it's been like 20 days now since i'm supposed to hear from a therapist to set up an appt...

20090424154838AAdsdki	Health;Dental	PLEASE HELP - Will my mother be okay?	She had a partial denture put in on Wednesday. Yesterday a swelling red bump appeared under her left eye and the whole area around her eye is red. The dentists reassured her it was bruising because there's one tooth on each side that goes high up to the eye area and that can cause bruising later. However, today, the same red mark is forming on her other eye (however, now there is no swelling on either eye) and she doesn't seem to be in much pain (at least not from the eyes). She got aan antibiotic on day 1 and she's been taking it on time for the most part. Is this just bruising, could it be a side effect from the antibiotic/pain pill??

Sometimes it only hurts at the beginning then gets okay for awhile but still doesn't feel very good and then hurts again near the end. Other times it hurts the whole time. But it literally always hurts and I'm so sick of it. I can't do certain positions at all because the pain is so bad, I've never even come close to having an orgasm from sex, and I'm just fed up. I used to think I was just young and doing it wrong and it would get better but it HASN'T! I always have normal Pap smears so it's not like a condition or anything. Am I suppressing a fear of sex? I feel like I want to do it. It's just physically awful. PLEASE help. My doc always just says use lube but that doesn't help a whole lot.

20090203102226AARdZGR	Health;Mental Health	Unsure about seeing a therapist?	First off I know for a fact that I'm a little unstable. When I was 17 I was raped, the only people that know this are my boyfriend and two of my close friends. After that happened I started getting picked on in school, like severely. It got to the point where I didn't want to go anymore, and I used to enjoy school very much. That same year I tried committing suicide 13 times, all of which were failures. Not because I was too scared to go through with it, but because someone always came to "save" me at the right time. (I'm very thankful for them.)       During that time I asked for help but no one helped me. My parents turned the other cheek and I was left to cope by myself.       For the past 4 years I've been in a relationship with a wonderful person, he's a good guy, he has his faults but I still love him. However within this last year I've been going, what we deem "psycho" on him more than once. We gotten into some really bad arguments, and I'm very grateful that he's an understanding man. I'm kind of scared that the things that happened to me in the past are still lingering on me both mentally and emotionally. I've been thinking of going to therapy on my own, the University I attend offers it for free.       The thing is, I'm really scared about it, so I'm not really sure if I should go. Anyone out there ever been to therapy? Can you offer some advice?

Yes I have my mom, friends, a pet and God, but I need the other relationship. The one that MIGHT lead to something more someday. However, even when I put away my sorrow, I receive nothing. I just want to have happiness that comes from being with that special someone. The love that you CANNOT receive from family members or pets of JUST friends... but the Love. I have told my mom about my plan... I have told my school counselor... and I am (on and off) receiving help. But they are not working. I ave a job, but I have been working there for almost two years so the issue cannot be about money. I am intelligent. I have taken showers and properly groomed myself with deodorant and/or cologne but still nothing. Why am I alone even when I am trying.   I need serious help before my time is up
20090220223138AAVzQD9	Health;Other - Health	Uhm...What's wrong with me?	For the past couple days, I've had a teeny bit of pain, between my hip and ribcage on the left side of my body. My immediate thought was Appendicitis, but I always thought your appendix was on the right side of your body, thought I also read it can feel like it radiates from the other side...       As of today, the pain is consistent instead of off and on. So /then/ I stopped thinking 'Appendicitis' and started thinking 'Pancreatic Cancer', because my mind lives to be negative. I'm not really showing any of the symptoms aside from pain, according to the thing I looked up...      ANOTHER THING. I was kind of subconsciously kneading the tissue there, since that's how I automatically react to feeling pain. I pressed down and could have sworn I felt something pop...      PLEASE tell me someone has the slightest idea about what's up...

20090220234636AACzhNb	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is my diet healthy and what else should I do? Have I plateaued?	I used to weigh 280lb, I started exercising and in about 4-5 months I lost 27lb, went to 253 and now weigh 255.5.      I think the exercise has done all it can without me changing my diet much, so a few days ago I went on a 1500'ish calorie diet and started keeping logs of my food consumption and weighing in every week.      Here's what a normal days worth of meals looks like for me as of now.      Breakfast: 300-400 calories   Kashi go lean vanilla oatmeal   Banana       Lunch: 300   Tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread   some veggie potato snack things      Dinner: 300-500 calories   Chicken noodle soup   Diet soda   More veggie snacks   Maybe half of a sandwich or some vegetables.      It has been varying, but usually I stay 100-200 calories below my 1500 limit bringing my average to about 1350 calories a day.      I drink a gallon of water a day religiously.      I run three miles three times a week, going to bump it up to four in the next couple of weeks.      My goal weight is 200-210 pounds.      I weigh myself weekly on Sunday, usually right before bed or as soon as I get up and record the weight. The reason I think I have hit a plateau is because my weight now fluctuates between 253-259 and my pant size has comfortably settled at 38 waist.      Is my diet healthy enough, and what else should I do to give myself a little boost with the weight loss and motivation.       Please do not recommend any cleansing/detoxification diets or alternative medicine, and please be above 18.      Thanks.

20090221003008AAoQ81C	Health;Mental Health	I really need help, but dont know what to do?	ok heres the story: i started feeling sad and crying for no reason, i cut myself and became bulimic, then i heard about depression from a friend, so i did research and asked my parents for help.  but they said itl pass. but it only became worse, then i did drugs.  my mom got diagnosed with bipolar, so i did research on bipolar, but still paper says alot of things but what u feel is very different.  then i started acting out, by doing alot of drugs, sneaking out, staying out till late, fighting with them. now they hate me.  they really hate me.  my mom is friendly sometimes but other times shes really mean. my dad touches me, luckily he hasnt gone down there yet, what goes on in his head i think is pretty sick.  then i met a guy, we had everything in common, we were best friends, i had sex with him, after a few months he started fighting with me the whole time and became really self absorbed.  he didnt care about me anymore, the only time it really looked like he loved me was when he was in fantasy world.  and he lied to me alot.  so i asked on yahoo for advice and got told his a sadist, so i did research on narcisism, and discovered my dad is one, thats why my mother cant get away from him and then i made myself not love him anymore and then things became ugly.  everybody thinks his a good guy, but i got to know him and his different.  so now every body thinks that im the crazy one.  i can no longer be in this town, i feel like im dead, i wake up in the mornings thinking about hanging myself in our yard.  my mom is so out of it now shes lost it permanently. my dad twitches like a drug addict.  my brother is starting to become like i was once, he is really sad and i dont know what to do about it.  my parents know we are hurt, but thats exactly why they keep on doing what they do, because now that were hurt we are vurnerable targets to their control. then i met a guy, he told me hes had a childhood disorder forever, so i geussed its adhd, so i did research and discovered my brother has adhd, but my problems just became worse.  my moms attempted suicide 4 times.  then i turned 17, everything became worse.  i have to stay alive for my brother, because if i die then his alone.  but im already dead inside, im becoming angry.  then after a while a light bulb twitched in my head and i read on adhd in girls and finally got my answer, now it finally makes sense why i shoplifted for 5 years since i was 7, why i went into a sex craze at seven and why i dont forget the bad times and why school has never worked out for me  and why people tend to reject me.  but now its really complicated.  my parents wont get us help and they continue with their ****, i dont know if they love me or just want to use me for relieving their emotional baggage, cause usually i sit there and listen to everything horrible in our family, but theres never any happynes.  i swear im going to die, theres nothing right inside me anymore, i really need help, but i dont know how.. im 17 now and my brother is my twin..

My period is due to start today, I am having terrible pain under my navel and the pain is within an upside down triangle area. I haven't had period pain for about 4 years now.      Or is it stomach ache? At work yesterday, half of our fridges and freezers broke down overnight and had to chuck out a lot of raw meat. Some of the packs of meat were spilt due to the weight of other meat on top of them and I touched liquid from various different types of meat as I was disposing of them. As part of the chucking out process, I had to bag them and had to wet my fingers with my saliva to open them. I dread to think I have early stages of food poisoning as the meat was out of fridges for about 10 hours when I was working with it.

20090218231308AACqY8e	Health;Men's Health	Effects of masturbation and dating?	I remember in the movie "something about mary" it's suggested that you masturbate before going on a date. I always thought this was a good idea because then you would have less sexual urge, and appear more independent or less needing of the person you're going on a date with. Which is more attractive to a woman than someone who is desperate and lonely, for example.  But, would it be better to not masturbate? What does testicles full of sperm tell my body chemically and how would it affect my behavior around a woman? would I be more confident?  I know this is kind of silly, but I'm just interested. I have a big date tomorrow. haha

I went to the doctor yesterday after being sick for 2 weeks and he said i have a prolonged Upper Respiratory Infection.  I went because I had been coughing constantly and for about a week i was coughing up green phlegm and wasn't gettin any better. He gave me an antibiotic and robitussin with codine.  I took the antibiotic yesterday, and there are 4 days left on it.  Last night, i began having really bad pains in my side whenever i cough.  Now I am having pain in my ride side whenever i breathe, cough, even move my arms while driving.  It also hurts in my back.  It feels like the pain is around my ribs.  I am still coughing up green phlegm.  I know it's only been a day of antibiotics, but this pain REALLY hurts and i just wanna make sure I'm not getting worse.  Any advice?

In the past year or so I've gained about 25 pounds but it's not a huge difference in my weight. I started my period when I was 13 and ended up getting on birth control pills to help regulate it. I stayed on the pills till I was 16 and then quit taking them afterwards. I didn't have a period at all in four years, till I was 21, and then had one for two months and quit and then didn't have one for another year in a half. No, I'm not on no pills, or the shot, or anything of that sort. I've been to doctors and noone can explain to me, why my period is like this.      Well I started my monthly cycle about 3 in a half months ago and have been on it every day since. Hasn't been that bad up until now. In the past hour I have been through 8 tampons and about a whole pack of pads. I called the emergency room but they said to call my doctor. So I called my doctor and she said I can come in tomorrow.      How can I ease the blood and the pain until I can get in to see her?

20090219132254AANNJlA	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why do people think that showing their bones and being muscle heads look healthy?	I don't like muscle heads mainly because their all jerks and look at themselves in the mirror all day. Plus all that muscle is just gross it makes them look plastic. I don't see why women think showing their bones is healthy because it doesn't look healthy. Why does the media ruin the way people should look so much? Healthy is just a little extra love handles I think not skinny or bones showing it looks like they are starving on purpose or something. Does anyone else agree? I just don't see how anyone finds that attractive.

20090219123109AAHduzV	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do you get your body out of 'starvation mode'?	So during the summer I went on a healthy, exercising high and lost 20lbs and 10% body fat. At my leanest, I was 110lbs with 13% body fat. However, I had the mind set of an anorexic: I was burning 600~1400 cals or more a day from exercise alone and I was finding myself extremely afraid of 'bad' food, crying when I accidentally had some not-diet soda. I also experienced horrible binging phases (eating an entire tub of frosting in the middle of the night). My boyfriend was considering leaving me because I had become a nightmare to deal with.    After I had my epiphany, I tried to change my ways and started eating more. However, I compensated my increased calorie intake with over-exercising and I found my body constantly exhausted..and the scale started creeping up at alarming rates: about 2lbs a week!   Although my "net" calories (calories burned from exercise minus calories eaten) was very low (around -200~600), I was still gaining weight rapidly.    I did ask a doctor and she simply told me that I'm exercising too much and that I needed to cut it down. So instead of 2-3 hour sessions, my sessions are about an hour and a half. I haven't gained weight for over a month, which is nice, but I haven't lost any weight either. My measurements have dropped just a little.      How can I go back to losing? My body fat is still relatively low (19~20%) but now I'm 132lbs and 5'4". I would like to be 120lbs (lose about 5% body fat). I currently eat 1300~1600 calories a day with 6 days a week of exercise (3-4 days a week is a weight circuit; I burn about 650-700 cals a day). My diet is relatively healthy minus the occasional sweet. I've found on not restricting so much on what I eat (just how much) my mind has recovered from it's anorexic mindset and I'm much happier.   It's frusterating because I lost 10lbs and got to 120lbs before without exercising one bit! And now that I exercise so much more and I eat so much healthier, my weight simply won't budge. How can I get my metabolism back to normal?
20090219125604AACfQzl	Health;Diet & Fitness	Some people tell me that I'm not eating enough....?	...and others are saying that I'm eating really healthy. Which is it?

I'm trying to lose 20 pounds. I'm 5'5 and 135 right now. What do you think?

20090219112735AAgOlXC	Health;Women's Health	Vaginal Yeast Infection Question?	Ok today is Thursday and I woke up with a horrible yeast infection on Monday.  I am positive it is a yeast infection.. I am 32 and have had a couple and bv and I know the difference.. Anyway I bought Moinstat 3 ovule and used it Monday night. Woke up the next Morning and OMG I could not walk or sit.. very raw, itchy and swollen. So I called my ob/gyn on Tuesday and she prescribed me 3 diflucan. I took it Tuesday and  I used the Monistat Tuesday night and was some better Wednesday morning. Then Wednesday night I put the Monistat external cream on after my bath and I itched so bad I thought I was going to throw up, so I did not use the final treatment last night. My question is.. my yeast infection is better.. but I am still a little raw and itchy on the external part mostly the labia area. Do you think this is normal? Or should it all be gone by now.

It is 5:30pm now and still I've had now bowel movements, though I did experience cramping last night at around 1am.     I've been taking laxatives about once a week for the past 4 weeks, so this is the fourth time I've taken them and the first time they've taken this long to work, though each week it seems they've taken longer.   I told the doctor about this, but she said to continue laxative use and hopefully things would start to get normal again, then to come back and get my thyroid check.     They did not get back to normal.   I haven't been feeling constipated in a painful sense, it's just that I simply don't have anything that tells me I need to go to the bathroom.  If I try to force something out, it just feels hard, incomplete, sticky, etc.   I have been on a diet for about six months and have lost over thirty pounds, however I am by no means starving myself.  I eat plenty of fiber.  I am in my late teens.   Any ideas on what is wrong/what I should do?   Thank you.   -Victoria

20090219110646AAiv9nJ	Health;Other - Health	Tactile/Aural Sensitivity?	I can't seem to find an answer to this question anywhere.  Everything I've found points to Asperger's, and while it matches some of my other problems, I don't think it applies.   I've always had sensitivities to certain touch sensations and sounds (i.e. nails on a chalk board), but for the most part, I think that's pretty normal.  However, over the past few years my sensitivities have gotten more severe in reaction and in number.   When I hear/touch/think about touching bricks, paper, card board, concrete, chalk, chalk boards, rough metal (just about anything porous) it stops me in my tracks.  I can't move, think or deal with it at all.  I have to get away from it as soon as possible.  I didn't used to have reactions like this to so many things.   It's gotten to the point that it's effecting my life and work.  When I tell people at work that I can't touch the shipment boxes they either think I'm lying or being difficult.   Has anyone ever heard of this problem and are there actual reasons behind it?  I also have pretty bad anxiety problems and tactile OCD (if I scratch my left arm, I have to scratch my right) which also got worse within the past few years.

Anyway, so when we hook up it only consists of him fingering me and me giving him a handjob or head. Last time we hooked up, he did it harder than usual.. and now Im really sore. Half of my vagina is swollen and it burns really badly when I pee. So that's when I started to freak out. So I check myself out down there and there is a sore in the opening of my vagina. Is this an STD?       Im not lying when I say that both of us are virgins - we went to the same high school. We were each other's first everything (aside from kissing, and we haven't had sex yet).

20090219122529AAlEdKP	Health;Diet & Fitness	Am I considered overweight. I'm 16yrs old 5'5 and weigh 139. How can I lose weight?	I started dieting and exercising about a year ago and lost 16 pounds. I stopped exercising in September due to large amounts of school work. Whenever I try I can't seem to get below 132 pounds. I know this is probably because I stopped exercising but even before I stopped my weight stayed pretty much constant after losing the original 16 pounds. How can I lose weight? My goal is to reach 110 by July so that I can wear a bikini again. Can this goal be accomplished in this amount of time?

I was just taking Syntha-6 with milk post workout and NO Shotgun with water pre workout. I just bought some glutamine powder to take as well and want to know where to fit this into my schedule.

Can someone help me out with this equation?
20090219122631AAOYvhO	Health;Women's Health	Yeast Infection or something else?	BEFORE you start in with the "go see a doctor" responses, let me preface this by saying I am out of the country until mid-March and I am in no position to go see a foreign doctor due to where I am currently staying (literally in the middle of nowhere).       Anyway, here is my situation (and i apologize in advance if TMI)       I have been having LOTS of clear, watery discharge (way 'runnier' than normal and often a warm 'gush' will come out ... trust me it's NOT urine! almost feels like a period starting!?) there really isn't much of a odor to it, but at times it has been slightly fishy smelling.       I wasn't too concerned until this morning when my husband and I had sex. When he withdrew, his penis had "chunks" of white/yellow thick, curd-like discharge on it (much like I would expect from a yeast infection?!)       My only confusion with it being a yeast infection is I have literally no symptoms -- no burning, itching, redness, swelling, etc.       Has anyone ever experienced something similar? What was it?       Again sorry for TMI :)

20090219124100AAnHj9n	Health;Diet & Fitness	Have I consumed too much caffeine?	Ok I'm kinda concerned for myself! I'm 12 and I had a major addiction to Monster Energy and Relentless... so, I drank at least 2 on weekends... but when it got to the holidays it was like 1 or 2 a day.   I've been to the doctors for panic attacks and I had to get my blood tested and my heart thingie monitored (I can't remember what this was called I think it was an ECG)    I got my results back and my ECG was fine and everything was fine but I had something wrong with my thyroid.   Also, my blood pressure was sort of low but nothing to worry about.   I've just read that a man aged 33 died of consuming 3-4 a day and 8 cans within 5 hours. This has worried me I'm kind of a hypochondriac I worry about my health all the time.   I'm going to stop drinking energy drinks all together because I took the "how much caffeine could kill you" test... I put in my weight and my favourite energy drink and it said that 35 cans of monster can kill you, but I'm pretty sure I've had more then 35 cans in my lifetime.   Is there anything that can help me like drinking lots of water and eating a lot etc that will get this god damn caffeine away so I can be normal?   I've also started drinking Dandelion and Burdock as my favourite drink? Will that make it worse?   Thankkkks

Were you in pain when you woke up from the surgery?      How do you know if you are bleeding too much when you are at home?      anything else i need to know!!      im really nervous!!      thanks
20090219165612AAjB8L1	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Any advice for someone suffering from anxiety?	im not sure if i can handle this on my own. i always worry about things in life and over analyze it that i cant think straight anymore. my first anxiety attack i felt like i was going to die and pass out. i then searched anxiety and i had experienced all those symptoms. i know its bad to self diagnose but i really want to get rid of this problem. its not a good feeling at all. now that im at the end of high school, im seeing that my life is going backwards. how am i supposed to go forward with feeling like **** everyday? i really try to put an end to this, i went to the doctor a couple of times for this. all they do is prescribe me more asthma medication and say its just normal worrying. but i am not myself as i was 4 years ago, im unmotivated, and starting to notice social problems now. if there is any tricks in getting rid of this without going to the doctor it would be great. thanks

20090219152840AAAB7mC	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can i lose weight like this?	Okay so Im pretty fit but I have some chest and stomach fat that I want to get rid of. I have been dieting for the past week but I really have not been exercising that much (because I just had surgery on my foot) besides push ups and walking around school. Will I get the same results if I just eat right and burn more calories than I eat or do I absolutely have to do cardio to lose weight?

20090219165511AAnyQ3V	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	Something WRONG WITH MY RIGHT EAR.?	Ok, so I don't know how to really explain this, but when I'm popping my ears, left ear is popping fine.   But my right ear pops, but it doe something extra, everytime I pop my right ear, something MOVES into a spot and when I release the popping motion it goes back.      This thing is also making my right ear feel full.      And I can do this repeatedly, multiple times, it goes out and back in to the same spot.      This is REALLY annoying and I'm scared that something is dilodged.      P.S., it doesn't hurt, but I'm afraid it's a prerequisite to something bad.
