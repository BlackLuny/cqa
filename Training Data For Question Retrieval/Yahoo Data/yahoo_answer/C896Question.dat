20090225023550AALJBCa	Business & Finance;Insurance	Auto Accident Settlement?	I was involved in an auto accident in August of which I was not at fault. I was hit by a commercial van with a lapsed policy. The claim is against my Insurance Co. Uninsured Motorist Policy which has a cap of $50,000. My insurance Co. has taken care of the damage to my vehicle as well as PIP of 2,500 towards my medical cost. I suffered a lumbar herniated disc as well as "soft tissue injury" to my mid-back and neck. Excluding my PIP my medical cost amounted to 10,500 including MRI's and Xrays. I decided from the beginning to not get a lawyer. When I felt I did not need continous treatment I called my insurance co. to settle. The initial offer was 7,500 to settle and by the time we were getting of the phone it was raised t0 10,000. This still did not cover my medical or any future medical cost. I spoke with them today and they offered 11,000 and said it was there max offer. Again, I said no that it did not cover me at all for future treatments. BTW I was treated for 3 months for my injuries and I am still in a lot of pain if I move the wrong way or try to lift things. Since the accident I am not able to do things I was able to do prior. In the last month I have spent 1,000 to make repairs to my home I would have done my self.      ***** My questions: Is this a fair offer? If not what would be a fair counter? Or should I just get a lawyer?      I am not looking to get rich! I know this was an accident. However, I do not want to pay out of pocket for future treatment or just that fact I can't do what I used to.   8 hours ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   When the say final offer or the max for my claim is that true?
20090225024106AAPhcKz	Business & Finance;Credit	What will happan if a credit card company wins a judgement against my dad for an unpaid credit card bill?	My dad currently owes $35,000 to American Express, and they sent a letter to our house yesterday saying they're sueing him. He was paying them for a while, but stopped paying about a year ago. I was wondering if he could go to jail for this? & also, if they could take our house. Our house is worth about $500,000, so can they take it for an unpaid credit card of just $35,000? & if they're not going to do either of these, than what will they most likely do in the state of California? Also, is it a sure thing that my dad will lose?

Hi,      I live in the South Loop of Chicago, and desperately need a job, even if its for 7 dollars an hour. I don't have a degree, and I'm taking a break from school. I'm 21, and can work full time, nights weekends, whatever. I have mostly worked in retail/restaurant positions.      I've checked craigslist, monster, chicagojobs.com. I have applied to every temp agency, I have submitted a resume/application to over 40 employers, and called nearly 200 locations, ranging from retail, to restaurants, to warehouses.      None of them are hiring, and only a select few are accepting applications for spiring hiring. I've seriously been looking for a job since december, and was previously laid off from a retail store.      Before this year, I've been employed by every job I ever applied for. I know its a recession, but I spend all day calling places, and going places, but no one is hiring. I have a car, and can work in the suburbs, but haven't been able to find anything out there either.      Does anyone know of any place hiring now? Any suggestions besides the obvious (craigslist)???      Any help is appreciated

20090225051218AA87cCD	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	Really annoyed, job interview rejection.....?	I went to a interview for a job that was just down my street (literally it was a 5 minute walk from my house), doing EXACTLY what i did at my last job, i have 7 years experience in this field and similar. Anyway, went for the interview, i thought i did really well and was silently hopeful. I gave it my all. Well as interviews go, i didn't get it. Apparently 14k jobs go to people with more experience they told me, but i was really great and it was a hard decision etc etc. Really bigging me up even though i didn't get it.... Desperate times means i have to take a pay cut in a field i know about and they took someone more experienced, (do you need a phd for a lousy office job?)       Long story short, today i got an email from another job agency about this same job. They called and said would i like to apply and i said no, i already had and was unsuccessful. Now the part that's pissing me off is that they told my other agency that i was great etc etc. Interviewed really well, knew the company, knew the job role, experienced.... then they chose someone else. Fine i can live with that. But then the job role opens again (a mere month after I applied) and they don't look back through past applicants? If i was so great why did they not re-consider me? Why the hell did they say i did really well if i obviously didn't in their eyes? Hard enough finding a job and i would of appreciated the honest feed back. Yet they lied. Why? What do they have to lose by being honest? It's pissed me off because now i don't know about my interview technique. Am i usually rubbish at interviews? Is my experience not as good as i assumed? Are my qualifications not enough? I have half a mind to call the job up and ask....

My mother and father applied for and got a grant from the council to do their home up,new roof etc,rewiring,in 2000.It took a few years to pass.The grant was accepted and the building works etc and signing off that the work was completed was May 25th 2005(all jobs had been finished to the correct standard).      My mother has all the documents and contracts signed at the time.It is her understanding,going by the REGULATORY REFORM ORDER 2002--SUMMARY OF GRANTS DOCUMENTS she was given then,that has long has she lives in the property for 3 years after completion,May 25th 2005,it is ok to sell.   My father passed away November 2005,so now,has far as my mother is concerned the condition of the grant has been met,May 25th 2008.With my father passing away,my mother no longer wants to stay in the house,she wants to sell and move back to the West Midlands where all her family live.      Does she have to inform the council of her intentions to sell the property(which by the way is privately owned by my mother,low income though being pensioner).   Will she have to pay back any of the cost of the grant/refurbishment etc.      Any help would assist greatly,because if my mother had to pay back any costs from the sale of her house(terraced),towards the grant,she would not have much money  left to by another in the midlands?

20090225042920AA5ijYz	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Budgeting but still enjoying life on a low income?	I am on a very low income, and because I love animals and want to work with them, I probably always WILL be (because things like vet and animal physio are pretty much out of my reach). I have to reconcile myself to the fact that I'll always be skint, but I would like to be able to own my own home at some point, and there are other things I would love to do with my money that seem a bit out of reach at the moment. Its partly through lack of budgeting on my part...I always overspend because I do want to get enjoyment out of life as well as paying the bills. Basically I should have been born with a silver spoon in my mouth lol.      So how do those who are skint find a way to make ends meet whilst still being able to enjoy themselves? I need to find ways to economise and save, and most importantly budget, and maybe earn a little extra in other ways than my 9-5. I should probably shut up and get a better paid office job, but I know I'd go out of my mind within a week.

We are in Indiana and my fiance has around $10,000 in debt (student loans and med bills). What would be his guidlines for filing bankruptcy? His student loans have such high intrest that $45 out of each monthy payment only goes to intrest. On that specific loan he can only manage to pay $60 pre month and he has 3 seperate student loans. The others are the same way so it's just taking money out of his pocket and into theirs. Going at this rate it will never get paid off. He wants to just file bankruptcy.

He wants to give me money through PayPal, but in Pakistan, PayPal isn't supported. He eagers for PayPal. I got no option left. Even though I had worked hard on his project. People had bid on an average of around $100-150. I made him for $20, I was job less and got no earning, that made me go for $20, so as to maximize the acceptance of Bid approval, he although was shocked to see the bid of 20$. I saw 2Checkout website, but it requires 50$ one time sign up fee, I think it's not wise to spend 50$ to recieve 20$ minus some processing fees.   The only option left to me is to forget the money, there seems no alternative. Do you have any idea?

The only things that I can find are large salons that cost a LOT of money and is more than what I want, need, and can handle.      I am trying to figure out how much it would cost, and how difficult it would be to convert a building into a small 2 chair barber shop.      It dosen't matter to me if it's free-standing, or a store front.      The main problem would be getting the sinks.      A barber shop by law has to have a sink and a wall mirror.      Wall mirror not difficult but putting in a sink may be.      So basically I have two questions.      1) How much would it cost to put in two sinks in a building? (If I hired someone from the phone book)      2) How difficult would it be.? (I mean, can I just get a couple of friends together and do it or do you need a licensed plumber or something)
20090225060034AAqwNM3	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Pay off bills or put in savings ?	I recently received both a large tax refund and an annual incentive check from my employer. I owe a decent amount on my credit cards and would love to pay it off. I know under NORMAL economic conditions, paying off high-interest debt always takes priority over putting money in savings. However, the industry I work in is at high risk for layoffs right now so I'm thinking it may be more prudent to put the money in savings to have an emergency fund to live off of for a few months in case I get laid off. Any thoughts or advice as to which way I should go with this ? I also recently received a pay increase that will allow me more money to pay each month on my debts anyway, and I am no longer using any of the credit cards in question.

COULD I POSSIBLY GET A DECENT CAR FOR $2000?	im 17 years old, and because of the financial situation im in im attending county college next year.    the college is about 30 minutes away, so im going to need to buy a car to commute to and from class.   my mother is basically broke, so she cant help me out with buying the car, so my ABSOLUTE max i can spend is $2,000   ive been looking around everywhere, and have found some decent cars.   but my mother just said that she thinks it would be a good idea to take out a loan, and buy a better car.    she thinks all im going to find are 'hunks of junk'   ive found not so bad deals (98 honda, 98K miles, for $1000) (dodge neon, 82K miles, $1200) which makes me think i wont be buying just a piece of cr*p      BUT heres the problems with loans...   to qualify for a loan, i have to have a full time job.   i couldnt be full time until summer, where i would need the car to get to that full time job, therefore id need the car FIRST   also, im going to be a full time student, i dont think i can deal with being full time student and have a full time job   after attending county do want to attend a 4 year college, and i know financial aide is nottt going to cover the full tuition to attend there, so ill have to take out loans for that.   i know more money equals a better car, but i really dont want to have to start owing money NOW when ill have to also owe later in life!      my questions are...   do you think i can find a decent car, that wont need expensive work on it, and wont cr*p out on me in the next 2 years, for under $2000???   should i just listen to my mom, and take out the loan???      honestly any help would be great! im so confused as to what to do!!!
20090225053023AAO2UNO	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I put my entire tax refund towards my loan?	I have a motorcycle loan (among a personal loan and a student loan) that is close to being paid off.  I owe 1700 on the bike.  Out of all my loans, this is the highest at 168 per month.  I'm getting 895 back for taxes.  If I use the tax refund towards the bike, then pay 200 a month I will have the bike paid off in June, otherwise it will be paid off (if I pay 200 a month) in October.      The problem is that I am broke as hell.  Me and my girlfriend haven't eaten at a restaurant in months.  We stay inside and can't hang out with friends because our heating bills are high and due to our loans we don't have much money.      So should I use the money as a safety net to make sure that if something happens I have some cash?

20090225062619AACvoZC	Business & Finance;Credit	Sallie Mae ran mother-in-law's credit?!?	My husband is 25. We met in college & have been married 2 years next week. For his freshman year of college, his mom co-signed his student loan (through Sallie Mae) because he couldn't get a loan on his own & couldn't go to college otherwise. They have not helped him or us financially beyond that point.      In January, my husband decided to go to grad school b/c he can not find a job with just his bachelors degree. Believe me, he's looked! Since June, he has applied for like 65 jobs in various states & only had 2 interviews & didn't get either job.       His student loans are supposed to be differed as long as he is in school (as long as he's at least part-time status). So Sallie Mae told him he needed to submit a few forms through the university & have them sign & fax it back to Sallie Mae. On January 2nd, he did all this. Classes started January 19th. He called Sallie Mae to make sure they'd gotten it & they got an attitude with him & were like, "Yeah. It's around here somewhere. We're busy. We'll get to it when we can." Then 2 (not one, but TWO) Sallie Mae employees told him he did NOT have to pay in January. They were like, "Don't pay this month. We'll fix your loan differment since it was supposed to already be done."      Well, Feb. 1st rolls around & his mom calls & leaves him this hateful voicemail about how Sallie Mae ran her credit and she accused us of taking out another loan in her name. We had no idea what she was talking about. We were in the process of buying our first house, so that was stressful enough!      Then yesterday, my father-in-law over-nighted us these papers from Sallie Mae showing ALL of my husband's student loans (for 5 years of school, 4 of which he did not use a co-signer) and the letter said that he was behind in his payments & that his parents had to pay for them!      WHAT?! He's never been behind on ANY payment! He's in grad-school now & he submitted all the paperwork & called several times to check on the status of it.       What should we do? Now my in-laws think we're "in over our heads" in debt  can't pay our bills & that's simply not the case. We're fine. Not behind on any bills!

Term:   Nine months   Amount  20,000.00   Maturity Date   2/20/09      Rate Information:   The interest rate for this account is  3.70000% with an annual yield of 3.75%.  This rate will be paid until the maturity date specified above.  Interest begins to accrue on the business day you deposit any non cash item (for example, a check). Interest will be compounded every 3 months. Interest will be credited by adding back to principal every 3 months.  The annual percentage yield assumes that interest remains on deposit until maturity.      Now, I think the bank owes me 740.00 but the bank is telling me they only owe 564.80.  Who is right and why?

I am 51 years old Internist making about $160,000 a year in a very stable group practice.      I have about $400,000 in SEP IRA and regular IRA when I used to be self employed.  Most of it are in Vanguard Target retirement fund 2025.      My home is completely payed off and worth about $280,000.      I contribute max to my current 401K, and have about $300,000 in cash.      I have no kids and divorced.  No alimony.  I have zero debts.      How am I compared to other 51 year olds?      Will I be OK for retirement when I'm 65?  I'm planning to keep working part time after 65 as well.      Thanks for any input.  Current economic condition has me a little bit scared.
20090225055236AAq34e7	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can I claim the first-time homebuyer's tax credit AFTER I've already filed?	I did my taxes on-line last night at HRBlock.com. I qualified for the first-time homebuyer's tax credit for $5600. It is not really a credit but an interest-free loan, which I would have to repay over the next 15 years for about $375 a year. And if I move out before it's paid off, the whole thing would be due immediately. I freaked out at incurring another debt and filed my taxes without claiming it. However, after I've thought about it, I'd be foolish not to take advantage of it and make some home improvements. Even if I move before it's paid off, the home improvements I make with it should raise the price of my home so I can pay the loan off.      Long story short, can I claim it now even though I already filed my taxes? I have an hour of free consulting with an H&R Block representative, which is how I'm assuming I'd have to ammend it.

20090225061815AAdJ3VE	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I'm going to live alone after I find a job?	I am about to graduate from college. And soon I will go find a job, but I don't want my family and relatives be involved in since if they do I would have no freedom the next long period of my life, just like I used to and I am now have little freedom.   My parents are concerning about too much all the time. If I go out I should always tell they whom I go with but I am now 23. If they don't like the boy I am with they'd urge me breaking up with him and they don't let me go out with poor boys or some migrants. So I rarely go out, I think I didn't even have more than three dates. I can't go out even in valentine's day.    I am sick of it even some think they are just caring of me, but it's really is controlling. So I decide to live alone after I find a job in another city, I may not go home or rarely go home. I can have fun with strangers, like sex, date. And I think even if I can't make much money I will not go home, I'll rent a house and live alone.    Besides, I don't need their help because I think I need to feel all the hardness of life by myself and then I can find a way to success. Otherwise I think I am put in some place to work and I don't know anything but I am ordered to do it.   So do you think I am right? Maybe it's not simply right or wrong I am asking but some advices or encouragements you can give me! THANK YOU!

This may seem dumb but this is our 1st full year with 401K so I am not sure if I understand correctly or employer made mistake on W-2.      We filled out to put 10% into my husbands 401K at work. To my understanding that is taken off the top, of gross. So on his last pay stub as well as on the W-2 it says 5047.       So if we pay 10% into it then shouldn't his income have been 50470 or pretty close to it?      I ask because his income was 44160. His 40 hr pay is 42848 and he works avg of 10-20 hr over a month. I am thinking his w-2 is wrong but not sure.      If it is wrong what do I do, I have already filed my taxes and wasn't until now that I realized it.

20090225052239AAn0vJl	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Really annoyed, job interview rejection.....?	I went to a interview for a job that was just down my street (literally it was a 5 minute walk from my house), doing EXACTLY what i did at my last job, i have 7 years experience in this field and similar. Anyway, went for the interview, i thought i did really well and was silently hopeful. I gave it my all. Well as interviews go, i didn't get it. Apparently 14k jobs go to people with more experience they told me, but i was really great and it was a hard decision etc etc. Really bigging me up even though i didn't get it.... Desperate times means i have to take a pay cut in a field i know about and they took someone more experienced, (do you need a phd for a lousy office job?)      Long story short, today i got an email from another job agency about this same job. They called and said would i like to apply and i said no, i already had and was unsuccessful. Now the part that's pissing me off is that they told my other agency that i was great etc etc. Interviewed really well, knew the company, knew the job role, experienced.... then they chose someone else. Fine i can live with that. But then the job role opens again (a mere month after I applied) and they don't look back through past applicants? If i was so great why did they not re-consider me? Why the hell did they say i did really well if i obviously didn't in their eyes? Hard enough finding a job and i would of appreciated the honest feed back. Yet they lied. Why? What do they have to lose by being honest? It's pissed me off because now i don't know about my interview technique. Am i usually rubbish at interviews? Is my experience not as good as i assumed? Are my qualifications not enough? I have half a mind to call the job up and ask....

20090225055153AA6YSAq	Business & Finance;Small Business	Converting business to a Barber shop?	It is difficult to find a barber shop or salon anywhere in my area that is for sale.      The only things that I can find are large salons that cost a LOT of money and is more than what I want, need, and can handle.      I am trying to figure out how much it would cost, and how difficult it would be to convert a building into a small 2 chair barber shop.      It dosen't matter to me if it's free-standing, or a store front.      The main problem would be getting the sinks.      A barber shop by law has to have a sink and a wall mirror.      Wall mirror not difficult but putting in a sink may be.      So basically I have two questions.      1) How much would it cost to put in two sinks in a building? (If I hired someone from the phone book)      2) How difficult would it be.? (I mean, can I just get a couple of friends together and do it or do you need a licensed plumber or something)

20090225050630AAP3ZFx	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	Tax arrears advice please?	Anyone who works, or has worked for the Inland Revenue - or who knows the answer to this question? I have tax arrears of around ￡4500 which I have offered a repayment in installments, but IR say that they cannot accept my offer as it is too low. I want to know what I can do, or what they can do.      They can take me to court, which I don't mind as my credit file is already bad. I am self employed and have lost quite a bit of work - that is why I cannot pay my tax off in full.      I am not a home owner so they cannot try and secure the debt on my home, or make me sell it as I do not have one   I do not own a car so they canot seize that.   I live in a furnished apartment so have no goods they can take if they send bailifs around.   I have no stock or assets in my business, all I have is my computer that I work from - and they cannot take that as I would not be able to carry out my work if they did - so they are not allowed to touch it.   I have no assets or money put by.   They can freeze my bank account if they wish, but I get the cash first then pay it into the bank so I would not use my account if they did - when I get paid by cheque I often use a cheque cashing shop to save on clearance times - so nothing to loose out on there.   What are their other options if I cannot pay what they are asking for? What else can they do?   They can declare me bankrupt if they wish - nothing to loose and I can then write off all my other debt at same time, so probably better for me.

I have a credit card with a bank, that I spoke with and agreed to a payment plan and that same day they filed for small claims court because the different departments in the bank do not relay information.  They filed because I was $9 short on my December payment, and my January payment was 10 days past due, after already agreeing to receive a payment in 2 days in full, they still filed.  Are they able to do this?  I thought once you agree to payment terms you were protected.  The same day I was to make the payment, I received notice of the small claims action against me.  They said they couldn't stop the suit, so now I have to go, but is it worth me trying to fight it?  The debt is true, I am not arguing that, but how they handled it is what I am very upset with.

By illegal I mean I live in the basement under my landlords and they incl all the bills in the rent which is now 1050. per month. We moved in Jan of 06 the rent was originally 950. per month so my fiancee and i gave them 1900 in total that only covered the 1st and last mo rent no security . After we gave them the 1900 my landlord asked if instead of 950 to make it an even 1000 so we can use their cable service. and he gave us a cable box to use their cable. Since the beginning of 08 my landlords have been acting very childish and nosey go into the apt when are not home they go into our bedroom when we were there (i know this b/cuz i set them up with traps to catch them) also there have been floods and some damage that they caused with out any repairs. Basically i can take a hint they would like to see us leave with out telling us upfront so we would like to leave by march 1st because we can not take their crap any more. My question is can my land lord gives us a problem if we talk to him today and let him know we will be out by mar 1st and just to use the last months rent we paid in the beginning? with of course an Additional $100. since we originally paid 950. and the rent is now up to 1050.? PS this is just a month to month rental no lease with apt taht was signed nor documented

20090203143324AAM3oeP	Business & Finance;Investing	Need info on value of silver coins?	I have about $300 in silver coins that i found after my parents died.  They separated them into quarter/dime/nickels and had them all put into coin rolls.   I remember when they stopped making them into pure silver, (around 1960's) that my parents saved all they could find.   I will be dividing the total between my family equally.    Is there a site we can find if any of these coins are worth a lot?     Is there someplace that just buys bulk for a set price?   ie; $100 for $200?    I know that the condition, ie mint or avg would change the value, but what else should I know or look for.     Also, I know that certain years maybe worth more than others. If for instance, they say, years 1950 to 1953 have little value, but years 1959 to 1962 are more valuable, would save time and look for specific years.    Or, stated differently, what "scams" or "tricks" that we can fall prey to or avoid?

20090225064226AAEtLlQ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	Two jobs - same pay - which one should I choose?	Got two IT job offers.  Both with the same organisation I have been contracting with for the last year or so. One job is the role I have been filling as a contractor.  I know the job and I’m very good at it.  However, it can be rather boring and repetitive.  I’ve been told by my manager than if I stay in this role they can see me progressing quickly to the next level and to a job I’d much prefer to do.  The job is easy and I get lots of spare time to mess about doing stuff on the internet etc.       The other job is quite hardcore.  In reality, it should be a much higher band that it currently is.  It is essentially taking on a whole lot of responsibility and work. Once out of the period of transition, I would be on my own.  There is a team structure, but I would be expected to be this fountain of knowledge on a particular system.  Total accountability if something goes wrong.       I’ve never had a job which required me to be pro-active.  I’ve got a good education – hold an MSc (in a totally unrelated subject).     Both jobs pay the same.  The current one is easier to get to travel wise.  The other would give me great experience that could be translated to other jobs in the future, but I would lose my technical back ground – which I quite enjoy.  If I was to continue with an IT career, I would prefer it to be a technical role rather than a management role.       On top of that, I have another job interview next week for another organisation.  I don’t really want any of these jobs, but have chosen to stay put to personal reasons and I can’t get the type of work I’m like to do where I currently live.       Any advice!?

It makes sense to me that I cannot claim it but I was wondering if anyone else has encountered this...

I've asked my brother but he doesn't seem to be able to answer it.

If you could answer or just help give me a little more insight that would help answer the question, that would be great.    Please and thank you.

20090203143114AAVQQM1	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I refinance my car loan?	I have NO idea how anything works relating to credit, refinancing and I'm not even sure how my car payment works.    I got my car last year after an accident with the old one.  I still owe about $14,000 on it and have until 2014 to pay it off. I had little credit history at the time and got stuck with a 15.50% APR. Right now my credit history is between good and excellent.  So far I've paid about $2200 in interest.    Car is a 2008 model and according to kbb.com it's worth more than what I owe.    Is my best bet to refinance (and if yes, where?), should I just keep paying as it is, should I make large payments: what would be the best and cheapest way to tackle this loan? I don't mind paying a bit more every month or shortening the time for the loan.    Thank you in advance!
20090203142718AAJQB3p	Business & Finance;Credit	How can i get an unauthorized charge that was sent to collections removed from my credit report?	In the Fall of 2006, when I was still in college, a roommate of mine contacted Charter Communications to schedule cable/internet installation. My social security number was given to Charter (instead of my roommate's).       I eventually spoke to my roommate about this issue, and indicated that I did not want my information to be used. I then called Charter myself to notify them of our decision to not have the cable installed.       Apparently, a representative still came to our apartment in an attempt to install the aforementioned services. No one was home. Nothing was installed. However, approximately one month later, I received a bill in the mail from Charter for this attempted "installation."       I called Charter immediately, spoke with a representative and then a supervisor to dispute this charge. After about 30 minutes of explaining the situation and arguing my case, I was told that the charge would be taken care of, and that I owed them nothing.       A few weeks later, due to an unfortunate suicide across the hall from our apartment, my roommates and I relocated to another apartment. I returned a couple of times shortly after to check for mail, but hadn't received anything from Charter, and was not expecting to, given that I had seemingly resolved the issue over the phone.       After I graduated from college and moved to the New York City area, I received a batch of mail from my mother, one of the pieces of mail being from a collections agency, Afni Collections. This was the first time I found out that Charter had continued to bill me, despite our conversation, and that they had sent their claim to Afni.      We were in the apartment for a total of 1-2 months, nothing was ever installed, and my information was given to Charter Communications without my permission. When I called Afni to pay the total amount (I had no other choice), they claimed that neither they nor Charter could make necessary changes to my credit, and that I would need to contact credit reporting agencies directly. When I called Charter after speaking with the collections agency and spoke to a representative, he told me that they kept no record of the matter after they sent the charge to the collections agency.       I spoke with a representative from Experian today, and she told me that Afni would had to make the request to have it removed. I called someone from Afni BACK and she said that they had no power to remove anything from a credit report. I'm getting a different story from everyone.       A friend has suggested that I get a copy of the payment and a letter from Afni stating that everything has been paid in full, and then send all of this with a letter explaining the situation to each credit reporting agency. If I send it through certified mail, I have proof that they received it and can use it in my uphill battle. On my credit report from Experian, it states that the matter has been resolved, but it is still on there, and will be for another 6 years, negatively impacting my credit, all because my SSN was taken from a copy of my lease and used without my knowledge.       What do I do? I am actively pursuing this matter - it has no place on my credit report.

20090225063537AAhtpHi	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does My Landlord Owe me?	My landlord knowingly over-rented an apartment located in WV, as I attend WVU. The City was surveying the house and they asked how many people lived there, we replied 8. Then the officer asked if any of us were related, and we said no. Apparently the house is only suitable for 7 people, unless tenants sign a release form saying one or more is related allowing 8 people to live in the residence. All 8 of us recieved subpoenas in the mail to appear in court. My landlord requested a later date, when no one will be in town to argue against him. Having no knowledge of this prior to the incident with the code officials I believe my lease was voided. I moved out, with my landlords acceptance. However, he still hassles me for money on the lease; when in fact he leased to me illegally. Can I request to settle with him privately for money back? Or bring him to court if he won't settle?

20090203150253AA65VBt	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Was my realtor in the right?	When me and my husband had to sell our house do to being relocated, the market was not good and we couldn't really afford to stay. My realtor suggested we try to short sale our house. At the time, we both had jobs, clean credit cards and 401ks. He put us in touch with his short-sale specialist and she told us to do the following: take what money we had in the bank out, liquidate all assets, (credit cards, 401k, etc). So, we did that. We took out our $ from the bank, we charged our credit cards up and we liquidated our 401ks. Our realtor then took our application to the bank for approval. He stated he had a "investment company" interested and we signed a contract, pending the banks approval. After talking to the bank, they stated we need to evacuate the property. So, we did that as well. All this just to short sale our home. Then after all that, the bank DENIED us!! Our house was foreclosed on after that, because we had moved and couldn't afford both payments. We are in debt to our ears now and our credit sucks. I just feel shafted by our realtor and just wish we would have let it foreclose on us, at least we would still have our credit cards and 401ks. I would like some opinions if you think I can or should have done anything..

20090203095947AA2zSHI	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	For those whose 2008 tax return/refund was delayed from Februaruy 3rd to February 6th to February 10th:?	Filed and accepted on January 16th through Tax Brain and accepted by the IRS on January 17th. Requested the normal 2 week refund and paid for it.  Expected date from SBBT was January 30th. Checked irs.gov three days ago and it said that expected refund would be February 6th. Checked yesterday as well as today and now it says February 10th.       After endless answer searching online I still could not find a plausible answer. So I decided to go through the expected nightmare of contacting the IRS by phone and speaking with a machine...errrr...robot.....errr some form of life that speaks. After a 20 minute wait my call was answered. I was not told anything about a glitch or error. What I was told was that I would NOT be receiving my refund tomorrow.       ****ANSWER I was originally given: I was told that the IRS had to make a minor correction to my return and that is what caused the delay. He could not tell me what the correction was(the system does not tell him), only that it was minor therefore the IRS did not need to contact me to make the correction.****      Prefaced by "its not set in stone", he said I should receive my refund on February 10. I went on to ask what could have been possibly corrected seeing as I used the same certified website I have used the past 8 years which uses software to prepare the return and I have never had this problem before. Again, he did not have an answer. He concluded with the IRS company line of "check the website next week and you should see new updates".      PLAUSIBLE ANSWER THAT I NOW BELIEVE TO BE CORRECT:  After endless hours searching I believe I have found the answer while reviewing an answer to a similar Yahoo question provided by user Meshee: " Meshee stated "we did our taxes on TaxAct and did not realize we had to keep going back and adjusting the rebate amount every time we entered a dependent, etc. so, the IRS had to fix our returns due to this and now we have to sit and wait."      As noted above I used a similar type of tax service(Tax Brain).  I pulled up my return and sure enough Tax Brain had inserted a dollar value on my 1040A Line 33 that should ONLY be entered if I was entitled to a Child Tax Credit.  WTF?  I never instructed Tax Brain to insert that so apparently their software is in need of an update.  I guess the IRS CSR was correct in that there was a minor correction that needed to be made resulting in the delay after all.  So all the answers in theory that people have been giving on Yahoo Answers such as your being audited, the IRS is in shambles, etc appear to go right out the window.  This truly does seem like the MOST LEGITIMATE answer to this question.  I just hope I won't be asking this question again on February 10.
