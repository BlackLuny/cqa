20070420115407AAsryMr	Business & Finance;Investing	What is your opinion of Investools?	I went to a seminar.  It was a very nice seminar about how to use Investools and the training available and a brush over what you need to do to be a smart investor using their site.  During the presentation, I was led to believe that their software is somehow linked to Yahoo software.  I mention this because I have a hard time using the Yahoo Finance from time to time, getting malware or other bugs apparently that freeze up my screen and or mouse and I have to reboot.  The portfolio part of Yahoo finance does not sort for me.  I am concerned that if Yahoo Finance doesn't work from time to time, I might expect that Investools might not either. They want $1999 to use their tools  and site and train for it.  If it works like they say it does, I would see no problem....if it makes way more  than or proves itself forward testing with paper trades and then with real money trades.  But back testing, people can make many things work.  I think they prove the back testing in the seminar.

20070611075410AAVRD1w	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I Rent Or Buy In My Situation?	I don't think owning a home is for everybody.   I owned a home for 12 years and most of that time I was married working towards the "American Dream" in a career I loved.   Then she left me and owning a home wasn't fun anymore. It was a burden and I was so ready to sell, even though once I loved the house, neighborhood, etc.   Now I am on disability and have lived in a one bedroom apt. for nearly 5 years.   I am comfortable here, but maybe too comfortable.   To subsidize my income, I have a couple part time jobs that help some, but by no means am I where I was. And I'm limited to things like yard work, etc. Something I use to enjoy doing.   So given my situation, I wonder if I should stay where I am or buy a small home.   Most condo's are too expensive in my area so I've already looked into that.   So am I doing the right thing by staying where I am?

I was also disappointed because TurboTax saved me about $20 versus doing it by hand, but the software cost me $50, so that's a net loss.

I am a 27 year old male and recently obtained my Bachelors Degree in Psychology with a minor in Marketing. I live in Michigan and good jobs seem hard to come by.       In addition to this I'm am really just not sure what I really want to do or what types of jobs are truly right for me. I have tried several different career assessment tools (things such as Myers-Briggs ect.) and haven't found many to be very useful.      What I value in a career:    -I need to make at least $30,000/yr (Ideally $40,000+)   -Little to NO direct supervision   -Minimal required interaction with general public   -Good Hours (mon-fri) or Flexible Hours (Work at Own Pace)   -Occasional travel involved   -Fun work environment ( a "zoo" vs. an "office" )      I do not have any post-graduate work experience to speak of and the majority of my past work experience is customer service oriented. I possess excellent interpersonal skills but I am definitely not a "people person." What I mean is that although I am capable of it,  I do not particularly enjoy having to socialize with the general public on a daily basis.       My interests consist of:   -Hunting   -Fishing   -Travel   -Music   -Movies   -Motorcycles   -Consumer Electronics      After reading about my education, career values, and interests what types of career/jobs would you recommend?

At present he lives in a flat with his Dad who has about ￡11k (if not more) debt outstanding, most of this being rent arrears. He has been told to pay nearly half his monthly income towards rent and the rent arrears, but he has now got a CCJ and gas and electric are on a meter to claim further arrears.   His Dad is currently awaiting an assessment for mental health and it's quite clear he is struggling, to the point he is teetering on the edge of eviction if he fails to make one payment.   I've never thought of this possibility before, but it may save them from homelessness if his Dad signs over the lease, however how does he go about it and where to? We're in the UK.

Okay here's my dilemma: I was working for a company by the name of MobileLife. A little after Christmas they told me that they had to let me go due to job reduction. They also told me that I would receive all of the money that they owed within 72 hrs. Okay after the 72 hours was up they still hadn't paid me. Keep in mind now they owed me close to a 1000 dollars which was a hourly check and a commission check. The 72 hours was up on a Tuesday after that I contact the store manager and she told me that the corprate office said that I wouldn't get paid until the regular pay day which was that friday after. Well when friday came they only sent me a hourly check. So I called the store manager and she told me that I wouldn't get my comission check until the next pay day. The week of the next payday the store manager called me saying there was a rumor going around that we weren't going to paid commission. So I called the operations manager at the corprate office and he told me that I wouldn't get my commission check until Jan.30. So the 30th comes I go to pick up my check and the store manager tells me that everyone in the corprate office was fired and we didn't have any checks, she said that she had called the guy who used to be the operations manager and he said that we would get checks on the 31st. So the 31st comes and everyone who still works there got a pay check but me and the other girl that was let go didn't have a check there. Do I have grounds to sue and if so would I win?
20090131100034AAOmEua	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can my boyfriend claim my child on his taxes?	My boyfriend and I have lived together for 4 years. I have 3 children from a previous relationship and my boyfriend has no children. I do not receive any child support from my kids biological father. My annual income is about $25,000 and my boyfriend's is about $70,000. He provides more than half of the support for our family. So can he claim my children on his taxes?

20090131100226AAtXFcJ	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How do I figure out what I owe on my taxes for shares shares sold on an online trading account?	I started the account in 2008, and made total deposits throughout the year of roughly $2800.  I did a little day trading, and made money a few times, but ended the year down - I now have about $1800 in the account, and have never withdrawn money.  When I imported my info from the account into TurboTax, it caused my refund to go down by over $1000 for Federal and $300 for State, meaning I am being taxed roughly $1300.  But what am I being taxed on, when I have a net loss for the year on trading?   Please help!!  Is there a manual way to enter the info?  Should I be taxed at all?   Thanks in advance for any help you can provide on this!  I can provide additional info if there's not enough here to answer.

20090131104805AAFjNoZ	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	In DESPERATE need of advice!!! Can we break our lease?	In October, my fiancee and I were both working and making about $8000.00/month combined.  We were living in a very small one bedroom apartment ($900/month).  He has a little girl (3 yrs old).  We decided to upgrade to a very cute and cozy 2 bedroom that we fell in love with.  The rent is $1150/month and at the time we signed the lease we could afford it.  We wanted his daughter to have her own room and were very excited to set it up for her.  Anyway, I got laid off and his hours were cut almost in half.  I have been desperately seeking a job ever since and had some hooks but nothing has remained permanent (i just had a great interview yesterday and they are supposed to make me offer by this Wednesday so I can start on Thursday. So hopefully things will be looking up). Anyway his truck note is behind and the REPO guy was at our house this morning. Thank GOD he picked up extra work today (Saturday) and wasn't home for them to take his truck.  I was so scared and have never been faced with that before.  We always pay our bills.  We literally do not leave the house unless we have to to save money. And do not buy anything beyond gas and food.  What is the point of us living in this house if we can't enjoy the rest of our lives.  We signed your standard lease, but are seriously considering having to move somewhere cheaper or move in with relatives (if we can).  Can we break our lease?  What are our options legally?   I do not want to hurt the owner of the house in any way financially, but we just simply can't afford it.  I know their are people worse off than us.  And I know the rest of the country is feeling the current economic downfall too and I pray we can all stay as positive as we can be.

In that lease It does state that all stipulations of the lease will be valid after the lease runs out and am on a month to month basis. In the lease it also stated that they needed a 60 day notice before moving out. it also stated that we can not move out between November and February cause its hard to rent out during the winter months. we gave our 60 day notice on September 14th 2008, we were completely moved out and in another home on October 30th of 2008, he said sence the 60 notice doesn't end until Nov. 14th we have to pay for Nov through Feb. now he wants to take me to court cause of that 14 days difference. I asked him for the original copy of the lease with my ink signature and he said he didn't have it, he gave it to me. can you find any laws to help my case?

In my city there is a job offer available for an unarmed security guard at a distribution warehouse. It doesn't say where and what kind of warehouse on the job search engine. Why would anyone need to hire an unarmed guard at a warehouse? Is it in an unsafe part of the city?

I'm not in shape at all and kind of short and don't want to fight anybody, so is this the job for me? The pay is $18 an hour and would be good to work around school. Any information will be helpful.

I have roughly 1300 dollars in credit card bills, I have a Suzuki GSXR motorcycle that I owe 8500 dollars on. I have good credit, but I show no income.

No the check is 100% real as far as I can see (real watermarks, security scans etc...) I called the number on the letter and talked to a lady about this and she said all I need to do is deposit the check of 2950, once that is in my account I need to call her and she will give me the info on who I need to send the 2950 to. Once that is done a date is scheduled for delivery of the full amount by UPS, FedEx or DHL. She let me know that once that time comes I must be present with my ID in order for them to release the check to me. She didn't state the need for any "fees" or anything I would have to pay out of my own pocket either. Please help me with this or if you know someplace I can call or email for answers please let me know. I don't want to be scammed and I don't want to miss out on the real thing if this is in fact it!

20090131141828AAvqyjp	Business & Finance;Investing	My financial advisor did not inform me until it was very late that I was losing money in a stock, what do I do?	I lost over 7 grand in a stock that fell 80 points since I bought it, my financial advisor told me he was going to sell the stock since it was at rock bottom. I am really upset that he didnt tell me when it fell at least 50% and I was investing that money with intentions for putting it into upkeeping for my home. I know the economy is bad right now but I am upset because I put my trust into him to watch for these falls. What can I say to him and I am really concerned that this is going to happen again in the future? What can I do?

20090131143024AAOcXIf	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	First Time Home buyer?	I am a first time home buyer and just have a couple questions.      A little information about myself is that I am 22, and a senior in college(graduate Fall 2009).  I am a server making $30,000 a year, but that will surely change once I am out of school and have more time to work.  I currently have $3,000 in credit card debt, but will probably pay that off this summer.  My credit history is good since I have never had a discrepancy or late payment in my life.     I also have a girlfriend/fiance who is looking to co-sign with me.  She is a junior in college and has no debt/makes $15,000 a year currently.  My parents are also willing to co-sign and have excellent credit.  Problem for me is that I have little money for a down payment.      Given the current financial climate do you believe it will be difficult for us to get a loan?  I know this is a question more suited to a mortgage broker, but I am just beginning my quest into buying a house and just wanted a little feedback as well as some advice for a potential home buyer.
20090131143125AApWFcK	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	My landlord had construction done and now I have two flat tires. Can they be obligated to reimburse me?	A different landlord did reimburse me ten years ago when I was in a similar situation, but I'm not sure if they were obligated to do so or if they were just being nice. Considering that it was a large management company with complexes containing hundreds of units, I doubt that they were simply being nice.     Is there any requirement for them to reimburse for damages caused by their actions (or rather, the inaction of their agent who didn't pick up all the nails)?    I am in Columbus, Ohio USA

20090225090724AAAZzP6	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Never signed lease with new landlord?	About a month after I moved into a new apartment on a month-to-month basis, the building changed hands. I was never approached to sign a lease with the new landlord. I was promised new carpet and other upgrades by the previous management, but the new landlord refused to do them and does only the minimum as far as repairs.       Also, it may be some discrimination going on - they gave new tenants a parking space when they knew I was on the waiting list and was told I couldnt have a pet but tenants that have moved in after me has them.       I put up with this for 3 years and now Ive had enough. My question is, can I still get an eviction on my record if I move without giving a 30 day notice? Technically I dont have a lease with these punks, and Ive decided Im going to fight if they take me to court. I dont feel I owe these slumlords any respect & I plan to leave the apartment the way I moved in - dirty & torn carpet & soiled walls. I live in CA. Thanks!

20090225093720AAHTN4Z	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can I be claimed as a dependent?	I graduated in May 2008 as a full-time student and started work in late June, maybe early July.  I was 23 by the end of the 2008.      I grossed 16,000      While I was at college, I was not living in the same physical address as my parents (my college is not in the same state as my parents).      While I was in college, my parents paid for everything (took a loan out for the tuition, books, etc.).  The school loan, however, is in my name, though my father pays the monthly rate.      After college, my parents are still paying off the loan on tuition and the car.  Otherwise, I support myself and live in a completely different side of the country.      My wrinkle is that I don't know what counts as 1) Full-time student or 2) "support."  If I had to guess, the support is right around 50%, but I'm afraid of choosing the wrong one and getting audited.  It seems that we would do better as a group if my father claimed me as a dependent, but i want to make sure I qualify.  Thanks for the help!

I'm disciplining myself, and am restricting use of the cards to meaningful purposes like renting a car.  Because the limits are so small, the price of the rental usually maxes out the card, but I send payment of the total amount charged directly to my credit card company the very same day.  Is this hurting my credit score?

I fully support him in this. Please read on for more info about how you yourself can help influence society in a positive direction!!!         Fund Raiser   The Fund Raiser I am setting up is to help parents with Special Needs Children. The problem I find that I am running into is it costs a lot of money to get a babysitter to watch Special Needs Children. I have had to quit my job because after working an 8 hour shift all I was paying for is the babysitter, no money left over for rent, food or bills. So I’m setting this up so the families who want to work, have that option.   I for one don't want to be on welfare because all you get is the bare essentials. No toys or treats for the little ones.   With the help from this Fund Raiser me, and others like me, who don’t want to be on the system can have as close to a normal family life as possible.      If you are interested in helping or donating, please call me and we can discuss it, thank you for your time.   Email:tandsreid@shaw.ca
20070802110821AAuJcuT	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I pay for my a/c?	I have lived in my apartment for 12 yrs.  The landlord who has owned it the last 2 yrs has decided he now wants $25 for each month I use my air conditioner as per lease.  I haven't had a lease for 11 yrs.  We went a total of two weeks without heat in the winter (not altogether just in total) and I didn't ask to be compensated for the money that's included in my rent to pay for heat.  Not too mention he has work he should be doing on my apt and others.  Besides putting in a railing and cement slabs that he thinks is fixing up the place.  I haven't had a washer and dryer in two years, even though he said he would have them by the end of 2006.  He says they are two different issues.  I have put off paying him June and July but he asked again yesterday.  If it's such a big deal to him he should have put it in the rent increase.  Why would I pay for something I don't have a lease/contract saying I have to --- Just his say so.  Any opinions?
