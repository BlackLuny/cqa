Hi there, I ordered my Jasmine by Takamine S34C NEX Cutaway Acoustic Guitar (  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Jasmine-by-T...  ) and got it today. I opened it up and started playing immediately and was thrilled by the quality (It's a really nice guitar for the price). Anyway, I went to make an F chord and i notice that every string sounds fine except the high e-string. I then realize that the 1st fret is making the same note as the second fret (F#). Does anyone know whats wrong with it or how i can fix it? I would hate to have to bring in my guitar to the shop already so early in it's life :( . Thanks!

Here it is:      One day I woke to the crisp air of spring   And saw a robin simply sitting there   Before I’d blinked he raised a friendly wing   And took off soaring into the cool air      On the road to work there stood a deer   With eyes as big as the far-reaching sea   She stared at me, her gaze so piercing clear   I had to wonder: how much does she see?      When I returned, as always, I was met   With admonishing words, a bitter face   My wife lashed out; I’ve never pleased her yet   My children wanted only licorice lace.       (Yes, I know my iambic pentameter isn't perfect, but never mind that for the moment.)      I don’t yet know exactly what to say or how to say it in my couplet, but I would like it to give the idea that the narrator has noted that animals are easier to live with, and that they at times seem more human than people.   ^^If you can think of a couplet that sums this up, PLEASE tell me!   Also if you have any other recommendations as to how I could improve this sonnet, let me know.

20090219181959AAcYT9q	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poem...please critique Thanks!?	I would post this in R&P...but I can't post anything there :(         'm happy, I'm happy, I swear to you that I'm happy,   I say these in my dreams as my Mother catches rain drops down to me.   I wipe away my frown and replace it with a porcelain smile,   It's easy to crack but when it's there it is so beautiful.      I want you to know Mom that I am doing everything I can to smile,   I'm picking apart my emotions and only putting the good ones back.   I'm off the liquid that used to flood all my veins every night,   I'm now the man that you wanted me to be so long ago.      I sent a letter to my Father so that he could know I'm doing ok,   It was sealed with good intentions but there was still pain in the way.   I'm not trying to rekindle any friendship that I had with him,   I'm just letting him know that I still exist.      I often wonder at night if he will ever write back,   But that's like asking God for a second chance at life.   I'm paving my own road now that's going to make me ok,   I've walked alone too long down this road that leads astray.      As waves crash in the early sunrise I go for a surf to calm the nerves,   I wish I could pray every single night but I lost my faith long ago.   Mother I'm still here and your up there just singing along,   Well won't you sing with me this one song I wrote for you..      It goes,   'Happiness is virtue and virtue is a disguise for hope,   So when you lie to me I can the truth shinning on'   Shine on you crazy diamond, shine on shine on.   You really did love Pink Floyd didn't you....
20090219180616AAO8qXF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My character's name? Is this ok?	I have this name I wanted to use that I thought of. I looked up the name but it's a not-well known singer (not known to me anyway). The first names are spelled the same way but the last names aren't. The last names are spelled differently but sound the same. Would it be safe to still use it? Or should I search for another last name?      Thank you.
20090219184911AAhr9Hx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What Young Adult books are left for me to read now!?	I read a ton of Young adult books.

"The functionality in each version of the organization's systems has been brought up "one function at a time".      The organization knows what the organization structure was a the time a function was brought up.

20090219190046AAvO6Ux	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is love fundamental in life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one.  I'm probably asexual.  I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone.  That being said, I only have one or two friends.  It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me.  So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem.   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?

It is more than that, but I want to make sure it wouldn't scare people away from the story. Some of it would be very descriptive, though none of it sexual... It would mainly be physical, things that would cause pain. The character would not be wimpy, she has very strong morals and opinions that almost no one can change. There is also a hint of romance to the story. There's more too, but this is the only thing I'm concerned about at the moment.      What do you think?

20090219185549AAK4jeA	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of these poems?	Anger Death and Despair   Anger is where fear revolves nothing   Where tears devour and destroy everything.   While unstoppable fury   Lays waste to pure Peace and Sanity.   While death lies waiting   Peace dwells still crying and craving.   Whilst it’s said also that despair treads everywhere   Where love once stood, but stands no more.   While alls said to become aware   Succumbs to Anger, Death and Despair      A New Beginning    With love comes anger   With passion comes love   While they divide    They must subside   For when one comes   The others follow   Reeking chaos havoc to disorder   So subside they must   To bring love back   From within the womb in which it came   So shall follow anger and passion   With them gone once more   Shall be the beginning of love   In which it began   And shall begin again

20090219183212AAjT8KF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Another poem, titled, Reality and truth?	This abyss is in my soul forever,   Suffocating the walls of solitude,    Swallowing the sorrow of the past.    This abyss of my life is like the panting;    The panting of canine breath,   Always struggling to find the air.    But, alas, I am the chosen son.    My father has my faith wrapped up,   With all the sparkles filed up in white.    The folder of my likeness took,   The knowledge never gained, never believed,   Not known to be written in any book.    However, no matter the graveness,   Imagination gives the power of gods.    Had I to believe in such despondency   I would love the lord, savior, and chosen one…    But what is there to believe, but you, yourself.   Am I just another page to be burned,   Or the product of family times wealth?    I do not want things to plague my existence.   I do not need the white fences, white walls,    Nor any sort of picket fence, Truth!   Give me truth and I will show you me;    Give me lies and I act like the stapler,    Squeezing your lips together so tight.    The words spit blood, not to come out.    I do not need your empathy, or good grace,    Give me honesty and originality,    And I will show you my truest face, I say!   But where is the light in this abyss?   I still see these shadows piling up the sides,    As they sing, “Hello Child, Here we are,   Hello our leech and food for all.”   I their food for all the lonesome nights,   Fidgeting madly, never asleep, never here,   Never there, never anywhere, but dead…   Dead with the numbness I do have, joy…   Joy to knowing, I be safe, Safe in the caverns,   Safe in my longing, longing for truth,   Longing for what’s real in this terrific place.

Just wondering if there's a good source out there for purchasing electronic versions of books, OTHER THAN through the Kindle or Sony Reader.      I'm basically looking for a literary equivalent of iTunes, a one-stop shopping location, where I can purchase a book, in a non-proprietary format, and let it reside on my laptop computer. I really don't see any need to add yet another electronic device to my life, so I'm trying to avoid something like the Kindle.      I know Project Gutenberg has a lot of titles in the public domain, but I'm more curious about modern/contemporary titles. Say I just want a Stephen King or Anne Rice novel, in something like a .txt format. Is there a good resource for things like that? Or does Amazon pretty much have the market cornered right now with the Kindle?

20090220225027AA6IECJ	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Can acting 'the part' cause real emotions between actors?	I'm not really an actor, but I dabble in my high schools drama club.   For a project, we have to choose a piece of Shakespeare to perform.   A girl who I'm close friends with, asked if we could do something together.      Someone suggested the 'Taming of the Shrew', which I liked, by all means its a clever and fun comedy. Yet we ran into problems, she couldn't slap me. Whenever the scene came for her to slap me, she couldn't, and the whole thing is fake slapping also.      So, we remedied this by bringing in a another guy to Play Petrucio.   I'm fine with him taking my part, by all means, I dabble in acting, but it still bugs me that she could not 'playslap' me. We are very close friends who would never hit one another really, and sometimes I feel she likes me more than a friend. Yet it is acting, its all fake emotion.      The bottom line of the question is, Do you feel that acting can bring 'fake emotions' to real relationships? and she has a reason to not want to hit me?

20090220230143AAZ3ygK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Lestat or Edward which is the better vampire?	So, who do you think is the better vampire? I gotta say Lestat imo, he is much more developed than Edward as characters go plus Anne Rice wrote him as such a complex individual that he is believable as a person/vampire. And sparkly vampires, there's an oxymoron if I have ever heard one. So people who do you prefer? I have to know if other people out there still remember what a good vampire story is like or if Twilight has completely caused all good literature to be forgotten and replaced with vegetarian vampires and body glitter.       PS If you do not know who Lestat is please go read Anne Rice, it will rock your Twilight warped worlds.

I'll help sell tires and sometimes   I'll help them change their oil.      Remember that Jim Croce song?   "Working in the Carwash Blues?"

So they'll come back to change their oil   In another three thousand miles.

Though thriftless Nature poach my sweet love's parts   And strew them all about this glorious room,   My merchant mind shall scour her foreign marts   To spirit back the undistilled perfume.   If this world's yield of majesties confound   The showy principal of Nature's flower:   If fragrant half-lives sweetly uncompound   My partner-rival's interest in an hour;   O love!  Let Nature's jangled M&A   Float IPOs like bottles on the tide;   Her permutations of her DNA   May bubble, may buffet her leeward side;   But your perfume, seeping through the universe,   Calls options Time cannot but once rehearse.
20090220232652AAuI67o	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Could you comment on my thesis statements?	Students are constantly misinformed that everything changes. Does everything change? Can you identify and prove that x = x if the things by which everything is identified do not remain the same? Can you identify and prove that x ≠ y if the things by which everything is identified change?  One could identify and prove that “every constant is a variable” if the things by which everything is identified do not remain the same.       This writing is to refute the statement that everything changes. One who attempts prove that “everything changes” can identify nothing and prove nothing thorough search and research. You can never identify that which you search for if nothing remains the same. No one can ever prove that which can never be the same.        The statement “everything changes” is set to impeach the first principle of science that “the total energy of the universe remains the same.” Nothing can be changed except the order in which those which can neither be created nor be destroyed exist. Every thing except the order remains the same. Everything except the order can never be disordered. Nothing can be conserved if everything changes.    The statement “everything changes” is set to impair one’s ability to search, identify, classify, relate, question, study, describe and explain the different things. The ideas with which one searches, identifies, classifies, relates, questions, studies, describes and explains the different things remain the same. Students may find this writing useful in discerning the ideas with which one searches, identifies, classifies, relates, questions, studies, describes and explains the different things.       You are encouraged to reedit and redistribute this writing if you find this can be presented in a better manner to the benefit of humanity.

Thanks =]      P.S somethings might look spelt wrong, but this is in NZ English. :]   ______________________      The nightclub was full. I should not be here, I am underage and they only let me in because of my clothing – or lack thereof. The music was thunderous and the lights were blinding. A laser show performed overhead and a thousand people danced to the awful pop.      Why did I come here? I still do not know. I think it was peer pressure. Lila can be incredibly persuasive. My sister was evil, really. She had dressed me in a miniskirt, a tube top and put make up the equivalent of Dame Edna on me.      Lila led me up to the overhead VIP section. She carelessly sat down next to some of the people already in the booth and they immediately started flirting with her. Someone was trying to talk to me, but I waved whomever it was of with half-truths. They soon got the picture and later headed down to the floor to dance.      I watched the people below. Some of them danced as if they thought they were the hottest thing alive. These people still had desires. They still had hope! I wondered if they realise there is always someone watching from above, watching them as the insignificant ants they were.      There was a woman down there, wearing fewer clothes than I; dancing through a crowd of men as if she was a cabaret dancer. I could not believe that this sort of behaviour was condonable. Well, I suppose it is a nightclub, and I am underage, so I should not be judging.      “Hey babe, wanna dance?” I whirled around to find an overly cocky twenty-something-year-old ogling me.   “Not really.”   “Oh, come on,” he urged. Just at that moment, Lila returned to the table with a drink that some unknown had bought her.   “Come on sis, go have fun.”   “Yeah, sis,” the man was mocking me now. I stood up swiftly.   “Alright then.” I grabbed his hand and led him down to the dance floor.       We found at spot and started moving to the music. I was not enjoying this, so I put little effort into coordination. I bumped into many people and stepped on my partners toes many times. He did not seem to care too much, but his mind was obviously elsewhere. He soon tried to grab me. That is when I slapped him.      Bad idea. He grew enraged and I ran towards the VIP section. I began to run up the stairs and that is when it happened.   The multi coloured laser show paused on red. The music stopped completely and my pursuer was no longer on my heels. I turned, to see what had happened.      The dancers on the floor below were in suspended animation. Some peoples’ hands were up, as part of their dance. One person was stationary in the middle of the air after leaping from the counter.   What had happened? Why had time frozen? I checked my watch – the second hand was frozen. My stomach lurched, and that is when I saw something completely unexpected.      There was a big man, in dark clothing standing over a smaller man. The bigger man’s back was to me, so I could not read his intentions on my face, but from their position, I could tell they were not good.   The smaller man was cowering in fear, his eyes wide in horror. I took a step forward, in an attempt to see the scene better. I must have caught the smaller man’s attention because he looked up at me in shock. The bigger man looked over his shoulder at me.      Run little man, run, I thought. He could not – he was obviously too stunned to move. The bigger man growled something and then began to move through the immobile crowd towards me.      My heart pounded. Run, yelled my instincts and I obliged. Unfortunately, my fear had made my normally imperfect balance worse and I tripped up the stairs. The bigger man was now walking up the stairs towards me as I attempted to get up.

20090220231017AA09ZKP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please let me know what you think?	here is a poem i wrote about 5 years ago. please let me know what you think!      Harsh Beginning         A tragic ending to a short-lived life   Brought on by a single impulsive act.   The harsh beginning of a long nightmare.         Unable to see the light in the dark   Not knowing that his life had an impact.   A tragic ending to a short-lived life.         A rope swinging carelessly from a limb.   Friends and family are left to mend the cracks   The harsh beginning to a long nightmare.         People say whatever comes to their minds.   The lies are what get people to react.   A tragic ending to a short-lived life.         Friends are left behind without any answers.   Trying to sort out the lies from the facts.   The harsh beginning of a long nightmare.      A casket is lowered into the ground.   On top all the flowers are placed and stacked.   A tragic ending to a short-lived life.   The harsh beginning of a long nightmare.

20090221004345AAG78Vh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Book has slightly yellow pages?	Okay, so I bought this book, "Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System", and for some odd reason, the pages seem slightly yellow-orange-ish tinted. They are definitely not bright white. It might possibly be the lighting, but this drives me insane when the pages of a book are not stark-white.      It says somewhere on the pook that it is printed with "acid-free" paper. I read about it on the internet, and it says acid-free paper is supposed to keep it staying white, not yellow.      My question is: is it possible that another exact same copy of this book would have bright white pages, and could the case be made that it should be given to me for no charge, since I paid the same price for lesser quality?
20090221013001AAUh7oi	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I read a book and don't know the name!?	It was over ten years ago but goes something like this:      A girl's grandfather is the guardian of the second dimension, the one just below ours, and stores it in his closet. The creatures in this plane have no height and are, indeed, two-dimensional beings with only length and width. The girl can move into the fourth dimension, the plane just above ours, and invites a boy from school to go with her. They're captured by two fourth-dimensional beings, one of whom makes a special pair of glasses for the girl so she can decipher that reality with her three-dimensional eyes.      One of the two creatures possessed the ability to move into the fifth dimension and her bodily features were completely reversed, as a result. The other being thought she was hideous and tells her (it was a her) constantly.      What book is this?
20090221011548AAEyrMx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Obscure book I cannot recall?	I once read a book nearly ten years ago that I cannot recall. This one in particular was a paperback novel. The cover I believe had "scary eyes" in darkness peering sinisterly at you but this could, of course, be incorrect.      The gist of the book is something along the lines of a race of cavemen who live among us but we don't realize they exist. The hero of the story discovers his wife is one, and his son is a whole new species neither caveman nor human. The cavemen have highly adapted telepathic powers, very strong intellectual capabilities, and have strange dreams to "remind them of their primal roots".       I remember a strange section where the hero keeps having a reoccuring dream that he is a caveman lying face-up in a field of grass with an erection in the sun. He is feeling neither sexual nor ashamed, but simply basking in his body in the warm sunlight.       I believe the title of the book is one word and this word is what the term for the "cavemen" is called throughout the novel.       I assumed it was a bestseller but I haven't found any type of lead anywhere online. Help if you could, thanks for your time.

20090220234349AAGfenF	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Can anyone play octave double stops on the violin with the 2nd and 4th fingers?	I used to play the violin as a hobby at the beginner-intermediate level when I was in high school.  I haven't played much in the last 15 years except to play some of my old music every now and then.  Now that I am trying to encourage my very young kids to become interested in music, I decided to bring out the violin and start playing some.  It's not easy restarting because I find that after not practicing for so long I'm struggling just to control the bow and to play in tune. It will probably take me at least several months to review my old music and regain some of my former skills.       What made me ask this question is that I'm trying to look ahead. At some point in the near future, I will want to explore new music that I've never played before.  Now with YouTube, it might be possible to watch others play the music in order to coach myself.    I really like the Ave Maria by Schubert.  But the version I got has the octave double stops.  I can play octaves with my first and 4th fingers.  I will need to work to play the octaves with the first and 3d fingers.  But what really intimidates me is playing octaves with the 2nd and 4th fingers.  I'm 5'8" and don't have small hands, but it seems like literally a stretch to do this.  So I'm wondering if this can be done with the proper training, or if I should just find the other versions that don't have the octaves.      I am guessing that there are scale books that show you how to play octaves with different fingering.  I would probably need to learn to play the low notes with the 1st and 2nd fingers and then the high notes with the 3d and 4th fingers all in tune.  And then try to put them together with perhaps ear plugs at first and then without the ear plugs.  Then do this very slowly and ultimately speed up a little.         Am I on the right track, or do people just play the double stops they can handle?      Thanks.

I'm pretty confident with the post processing side, but from all the tutorials I've read, there was very little in regards to the actual settings and conditions for taking the picture. So, my two questions are:      a) How do I properly set white balance? I read that it should be done with the filter on, but when I try to set it (using the 'measure' function & a white card) it says that it's unable to be set. Presumably because it is too dark.       b) Exposure time. The meter is obviously not working correctly with the filter on, so how do you determine your exposure time?      Anyone who could simply tell me their step-by-step for taking an IR picture would be much appreciated.       Btw.

20090203113843AAomT85	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this plot good? wud u read this?	ok so two girls (probably late teens) they share a flat together and are freinds but also kinda hate each other in a way. for now lets call them stacey and keeley.      so stacey likes this guy a lot (lets call him joe, for now) and talks about him all the time. but then they go out to a nightclub and joe is more interested in keeley and dances with her all night and stacey gets realy annoyed but keeley is really drunk so she doesnt care, and she sleeps with joe.      keeley continues to sleep with joe for 2 weeks and brags about it to stacey. keeley decides she is in love with joe, and becomes convinced he is in love with her (but he is probably not).       then the next week keeley comes home early to the flat and finds joe with stacey. the two girls scream and shout at each other and throw things at each other. joe tells keeley he does not actualy love her. so keeley packs up some of her clothes and runs away.      keeley goes round to the flat of her ex-bf who is a drug-dealer and asks if she can stay there coz she has no where else to go. so he lets her stay there but she refuses to date him again.      the next day keeley finds out she is pregnant to joe and she is shocked. she texts joe telling him but he says she is a liar and she should leave him alone cos he likes stacey.      keeley goes out to the club with the drug-dealer, and sees stacey and joe there (who are now a couple). and when joe leaves keeley goes up to stacey and asks why she is dating joe and calls her a *****. stacey says keeley is just jealous coz joe does not love her. so keeley tells her she is pregnant to joe. and this makes stacey really angry and stacey punches her and hits her with a glass.      and yeah its MEANT to be trashy and a bit ridiculous. its not meant to be amazing literature or anything.

I know I could look this up, but I'm engaged in some heavy work and won't have the time for the next several hours.    So on to the crux...  I'm looking into purchasing a good macro lens, but I'm a bit conflicted.  Which would yield better results for true macro photography?  A shorter range telephoto, or a slightly longer range zoom?  And while on this topic, how about a brief explanation of the primary difference between the two?    I believe it has something to do with the true focal length, but I'm not positive.  Thanks for your time and answers, I'll be checking back in later.

20090221014913AA1vdWi	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Advice: when you don't remember the Title/Author!?	This isn't really a question..I've seen many people ask here if anyone has read a book (and they give a description), because they have forgotten the title/author. In this case, not many people know. I have a simple solution for you.   When i started reading (6 years old) i started a diary, a notebook, where i would write the title and the author of the book. I did this so I could count all the books i read in a lifetime:).. and because i usually forget very fast and i was scared not to read a book twice:)).   besides these advantages, it helps knowing what books you've read recently, you can easily reccomend some others to your friends or remember to be on the look-out for that awesome writer you loved.    People forget. You remember the plot, but you need to know the title and the author. this notebook is the right sollution;) never disappointed me. what do you think? is it a good idea?

It seems that the late 1980s and early 90s saw a plethora of books and article produced regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy; all of which either point to a conspiracy of some sort, or just blatant scaremongering.     Do you know where I can find books written on the assassination that were published between 1965 and 1970?

20090221014040AA3vcLz	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	I need help with finding a picture. Have you seen it (read more)?	I really need help with finding a picture.      i'll describe it to you,   it might not be overly accurate cause i havent seen this picture in a while but here goes.       its a picture of 2 little kids, a boy and a girl planting a tree.      then theres another picture beside it of teenage boy & girl kissing under a somewhat bigger tree. (but the same tree)      then theres another picture of the same boy and girl under the tree with a little baby. ( think, i dont know for sure about this one)      and then theres a picture of the man standing under the tree with a cross beside him (the girl had died)      It was kind of like a timeline type thing of these 2 peoples lives.   And it isn't clear picture its more of a silhoutte type thing taken from a distance.      I'm pretty sure its a drawing and not a photo.      I originally saw it on photobucket but ive seen it other places to.      Please help, i really love this picture.
20090221014118AALjVPA	Arts & Humanities;History	What Effects did the Maori land wars have on British?	The British have this thing about always saying they didn't win but everyone knows they lost which is kinda sad to try and cover it up in nations less versed in Aotearoa History, so why the cover up? The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1835, 5 years before the Treaty of Waitangi. which was the end of war. Anything after 1835 would be considered a "New WAR" - so why do they try and hide the fact they signed the document and celebrate the Waitangi Day over the signing of the Declaration. In 1910 there was Influenza epidemic, Bronch. in around 1907, Bird flu killed 100 million people , the number was so bad it wasn't even accurately countable.    The Maori Wars took on the British alone, why were the British so ineffective? In fact it wasn't just Maori, they lost in the Americas, they lost in Africa, to the French, To the Irish , then to the Germans, in fact they started signing Treaties every where after people started kicking them out- South Africa and Australia was about the only places, and both only small communities were there with family- no military, no established government. The Maori and the Settlers faught together against British Imperials, so why do British have to fake the funk?
