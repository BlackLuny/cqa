ff03cd5287f1d62367e5f228fb2ec763aa	Ive got a witchitty grub station up here in the north west, with 60000 head of grub.  To start you will need to buy yourself some breeders.  Your local breed society should be able to help.  Contact ABRI in Armidale NSW.  Then let them get to work.  Keep statistics on the offsring, and sell off those breeders that are not performing well.  Look for characteristics you admire, like carcass girth and length, and cross breed between grubs with good characteristic to improve the lineage.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  PS Ants taste good.  Build yourself an ant farm, like the ones in the comic books back in the olden days.

VFmmVHGVaa	You might check the screen on the check valve in the well if you have proper water level it may be clogged.  t|`|MJpDjGeUaa	This is what you don't do. When living in Virginia we had a drought and a friends well went dry. After a day of brainstorming and several cases of beer we decided fracturing the well with explosives was the solution. Being in construction I had access to explosives and detonators etc. After setting the charge and getting ready to set it off, the owner decided the the blast would merely shoot out the casing like a large roman candle. He proposed a cork. So into the woods he went with a chainsaw, returning with a 6"x5ft.piece of locust. He tapered one end with a hatchet and drove it into the well pipe with the bucket of a backhoe. 10,9,8,etc. BOOM.!! The noise cleared our collective heads of beer and realized there was a 75 pound log hundreds of feet overhead. Everyone scattered but I dove under the engine transmission of my truck. DUMB, no one heard the log return to earth but the well worked.  RScott|`|DR138ethaa	Is your well a driven well...a 1 1/4 or 2 inch pipe coming out of the ground versus a dug well or lake pump.      If it does look to be a driven well then based on my experience It almost seems that your well point may be clogged.  The well point has a screen inside a stainless or brass perforated pipe.  It is possible that there is enough water seeping in to get the pumping started but not enough flow to keep the water flowing.  As the pump works a vacuum may be building up which sucks the water down.    Try this.    Take the pump off the pipe.  Get a small fishing weight and tie it on to a string.  Lower the wieght into the pipe until you hit bottom.  Pull the string out and see how much of it is wet...should be between 2 and 5 feet.    If you have water...which you should have...try this.    Take your water hose from your house and fill up the pipe...take a bucket full of water and pour it in....if the well point is in the water bearing strata then then you should be able to run water into the pipe quite fast...probably, in my experience, as fast as you can run water into the pipe.    Running water may also loosen up any fine sediment or clay film that has built up on  or in the well point.    If you have water in the well and can pour water in the pipe as fast as you want and the pipe empties quickly then you should be able to pump water.    If you achieve the above then you may need to take a look at your pump.  If you have water and water flows into the well easily but the depth of the water is beyond 15 feet you might want to look a pump specs.  Some of these pumps can't draw water from deeper than 12 or so feet.      I've driven my own well for irrigation, helped my neighbor drive a well, and helped my dad drive several wells.    My website has a link to a pamphlet on installing shallow driven wells.  http://www.redbayfarm.com/Voting.html
256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Are you sure there aren't  6 more meters somewhere else?  They can't lump it in, apartments that don't have individual meters normally pay for the electricity out of your rent and charge a higher rent to cover it.    Ask your apartment manager which meter is yours.  Then prove it to yourself.  There could be a little spinning disk that you see the edge of as you look at the meter - go turn on every burner on the stove and see it spin way faster.  So, with the TV and everything off but your alarm clock it should spin very slowly.  If not, start unplugging things.  How old is your fridge - older than about 15 years and that could be the problem.    The spinning disk shows consumption rate - the little number dials show how much has been used, but you really don't need to leanr to read them.    I'm not sure what the newer digital ones do to show consumption rate, but I bet you can figure it out.    And consider the calculations.  Your consumption is 481 kilowatt-hours - a kilowatt is an instantaneous measure of flow rate and a kilowatt hour is a measure of that flow rate integrated over time.  Your plasma tv might pull 500 watts (you should be able to find this info) 500 watts is half a kilowatt - so if you watch the thing for 4 hours then that's 2 kWh right there.  You watch the plasma for 240 hours a month and the electric bill starts to make sense.  A 60 watt light bulb is .06 kW and burns .06 kWh for each hour you leave that light on.  Your stove is probably 5000 W per burner and so 5 kWh per hour of boiling water for your mac and cheese (which you are on because the electric bill is eating you alive).  Work it out, is 481 really outrageous?|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Go read your meter yourself. Verify that the numbers are close to what the electric company says they are. What happens is the electric company will only read the meter about every 3-4 months, the estimate what you may use by comparing previous occupants of that location.  Ask for an actual reading if the numbers are way off. They will then adjust the reading rate and the cycle of the readings for the location.  This is quite common with all long term residence meters.  Also a TV will use a lot of power as will a computer and your water heater.  Good luck.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Every appliance uses a 'set' amount of electricity.  Therefore, you COULD do the math and add up the KW hours that your appliances run and multiply it by the rates (peak hours) that Pg&E charges for each KWhr.    Your mom may be on a special-rate plan (if she qualifies).  Since your household income is much more than hers, that's probably the difference.    I've heard that LCD and plasma tv's use alot of electricity and your mom may not have one??????|`|C7Q0bdsXaa	Every apt. should have it's own electric meter and fuse panel. If you can get the apt. manager to help you, go to the meter and fuse box.  First shut off the main breaker and look and see if your meter is still turning, even just a little bit. If it is then there is a miss wiring at the meter. If that checks ok, then tun the main breaker back on, unplug everything in the apt. turn off all lites. Then then check the meter again.If it is turning then there may be a problem with the inside wiring.  If you leave all the little electronic battery chargers plugged in all day, they are always using power, even when not being used. try these things and see if it helps.

8apA3Rffaa	If its a medium grey cement looking product, it probably is  a backer board. You don t know how thick it is and if it was put down properly.. It may not have been and the previous tile failed..I wouldn t chance it and I put all new in and do it to tile codes and specs.(ATC and TCA guide lines)    Self leveling compound isn t that hard to do but , if like you said, you mess up and it will leak to below. This stuff pores like thick water but will set up hard as a rock when done right. Any questions you need just e mail me thru my avatar, where you ll see my qualifications , and I ll answer you right back   GL|`|J4W68owgaa	I would put in a new backer board. Self leveling products aren't as easy to deal with as you might think. Not only that,but if there is damage to the backer board, you run the risk of the floor shifting in spots when you step on it. Any about of "give" in the floor is going to lead to cracked grout and/or tiles.|`|AA10758468	Pull it up and put new a new backer down so you have a good foundation. It'll be less work in the long run.|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	I agree with the floor guy. Since I also installed for 20+ years. BUT, the simple fact is that backer board runs 15 a sheet at the cheapest, and Ditra-Mat is far easier to use but expensive too..So the question is...Did you have any cracking tiles or grout before you started? If not then jump up and down a little bit and see if the floor has a lot of movement. If not then go ahead and grind down some of the high spots without getting into the backer-board, and then flash coat it with some mortar. Put a good thick coat on it, because one little high chunk of old mortar is enough to give you lippage on a tile. Give it 24 hours to harden then go walk on it, if it cracks you have to bust it all up. But that is just a few dollars more than than tearing it out if it is salvageable. BUT remember that by doing it this way you are going to raise the height of the new tile above the height of the old tile by as much as a 1/4 inch. It all boils down to time and dollars. And although you wouldn't want a guy to do this if you were paying him, you aren't. It is a perfectly acceptable way to do your own home,and you can still get great results. I wouldn't do it to a customer, but I would do it for myself, because I know that it can be done with careful attentive prep work. AND FOR GOD's SAKE WEAR KNEEPADS.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	You wouldn't have to worry about the self leveler leaking through but, the water if you don't get a good seal. It's better to take the backing board off and replace it with Green-board then put cement board over this, the the self leveler for the tile. This would be the proper way to do it.

6d743df6f2311d9c048596d7d1910abcaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I live in Spain and each summer, in low-lying parts, there are a huge number of mosquito-type insects which swarm around houses and offices in many towns.  <br>  <br>  The traditional 'stagnant water' hazard is well known and steps are taken to ensure this is not normally a hazard.  A couple of years ago (in 2003) we were informed by the Spanish Health Authorities that household drains, where the water lies in 'bottle traps' or 'U' bends can be a serious cause of these annoying and potentially dangerous insects.<br>  <br>  We were advised to flush each drain daily with a hose and pour bleach down overnight fairly regularly.  This seems to eradicate the vast majority of the insects and a daily hose is not much trouble.<br>  <br>  Obviousy some drains DO have organic materials, but the 'organic' part is, apparently not needed for these insects to breed well, what they need is 'still' water (or just damp conditions), so a good 'flush' will eradicate the vast majority.<br>  <br>  Good luck getting rid of them...I've already started flushing, as the temperatures here are in the 80's and 90's already.  So far I haven't seen a single mosquito...though now I do live in the mountains, where the problem is less anyway.<br>  <br>  Now...if someone can tell me how to get rid of houseflies!...<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  BobSpain|`|VWwdWI8uaa	Do you have live plants in your office/building?

lwMmZY4Xaa	I assume the balusters are square top and bottom. I would use baluster screws( double threaded course threads) Coffman part   C-3203 you should be able to get these at a local lumber yard. Screw theses into the bottom of the balusters and then into the bottom rail or tread if no bottom rail. The top rail should be a plowed rail and have fillet that goes between the balusters. You can do this two ways the best and right way would be to remove the fillet strips and start over placing a fillet strip in first nail it in place a baluster nail it on the side that you have no fillet yet. place the next fillet strip and repeat. If you do not want to remove the fillet after you have screwed the bottoms in go back and nail the top of the balusters in on the high side of the baluster. Also go to Coffmanstairs.com  they should have a installation section that may give you some tips.|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Sounds like the bottom rail has sagged down some - the balusters are supposed to be too tall to fall out.  If you measure the distance between top and bottom rails at the ends, near the newel posts and then measure it at mid span is there a big difference?    I would glue them - not on the ends, on the sides o f them where they will be touching the insides of the holes.  Carpenter's wood glue will work, Gorilla glue might be better if you have the right solvents round for cleanup, and "chair lock" might be a good choice.  As soon as they are all back in their proper holes with a reasonable amount of glue use a couple of strap clamps - like the web straps that you use to hold stuff down on the back of a truck - or even a bunch of bungee cords - to pull the top and bottom rail closer together so that the balusters can't fall out.  Clean up the glue squeeze out right away - with a wet sponge for the carpenter's wood glue (rinse often) or for gorilla glue a cloth soaked in paint thinner.  Let the glue cure for several days before taking your clamps off.  And put down a drop cloth so you don't drip glue on the stairs, wall below, etc, etc.    Edited.  Gorilla glue (or any other brand of polyurethane glue really will hold way better.  But, it works best on damp wood.  A little spritz with a spray bottle of water in the hole and on the baluster before putting on the glue is all you need.  And it foams as it cures.  So, if you clean up the squeeze out quickly and then go to bed you may have more squeeze out (foam out) in the morning and it will have cured and you'll be trying to cut it off with a razor blade and cursing the day you ever took advice from YA.  Fair warning.|`|3e1bae13ddaf48151fe483e2b7b738b9aa	sound like they dont fit  get a joiner on the job|`|BjUdtT3aaa	are the pieces between the slats still there?try to put them back in and use some small nails to tacke in place,if ther are any cracks left use wood filler and fill in so it can hold them back in place.
mwDuaWTFaa	Tinted paint aquires its color as it cures.  The curing process involves evaporation of the carrier (water in the case of latex paints) and a chemical reaction.  Most of the change takes place in the first 24 hours or so, but the process will continue for 14 - 30 days depending upon the paint and environment.  The effect is more evident in brighter colors (especially reds), but can be noticeable in lighter colors.<br>  <br>  By coating over the paint with poly, (which is OK, as long as the products are compatible), you have slowed the full curing process.  You may see some variations due to differences in the surface being painted.  Also, the amount of time the paint cured before it was topcoated could make a difference -- even half an hour could make a difference.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you did a proper prep job.  If you are using a water based poly over water based paint, it will probably continue to cure out and come to the same color over a period of time, but it could take a couple of months.  For future reference, if you need to poly over paint wait at least five days after painting to apply the poly.|`|1affa83ad0745f49e382a8f368114f59aa	Did you apply a coat of Kilz (primer that prevents colour seeping through paint)?

gBmhP2SIaa	You need to contact a mover or someone who has access to rollers, they use these to bring the two halves of double-wides together.  You can only get them so close with the truck but you have to use the rollers and jacks to slide the haves together.  The same would be with moving a single-wide in a tight spot, such as the one you have described.  Also if you are going to go with a mover he may be able to wench the home out of the tight spot.  Some of the movers have what is called a house cat (a remote control machine) that can do amazing things in very tight spots.  If the mover has a trans-lift (another piece of equipment that is amazing) it can literally pick the home up and move it perpendicular, this would be the route I would take personally.|`|181d3969ab21d94cd6dcf1295e2caf80aa	if you put steel ibeam under the trailer and jack it up you can slide it sideways. there should fuul lenght frame rails to lift the trailer,then a combination of chainfallscan be anchored at the end you want your trailer to move if you add teflon or kids crazy carpets on the contact points or even grease or oil will let it slide easier make sure you crib blocking to prevent the ibeams from falling|`|mwDuaWTFaa	It is quite possible with the proper equipment.  The trailer will need to be raised a bit.  After it is raised, something will need to be put under it to allow it to roll the direction you need it to go.  Normally, large dollies would be used.  These look like to freight trailer axles with a platform on top.  <br>  <br>  Since you only have to move out a bit, you may be able to use two lowboy trailers or maybe even some heavy duty flatbed trucks.

Expect to pay a bit more, but I would try to get quotes from at least a couple given the unusual circumstances.|`|opPBRdI7aa	there are several things you don't say but since you say that there is room to hook up a truck then there would also be room to hook up a very short little crawler tractor made specifically to move trailer buildings. the little guy is probably only 8 feety or so long and is infinitely more manueverable than a truck.  look for it at a mobile home mover's place. the other option would be to contact a regular house mover who could slide some beams under it assuming that there is room on both sides of the trailer to work. slide the beams in, jack up the trailer, set one end of the beams on a special built beam dolly, the other end will hook up to a prime mover for the lateral transfer. the unknown things you don't mention are whether or not the axles are still under ir or if it is on piers, both will influence the time, effort and expense.  since the little crawler is so short it's possible that he could pull it out with very little manuevering
mwDuaWTFaa	LVLs are Laminated Veneer Lumber.  A type of wooden beam that is very strong. <br>  <br>  The instructions provided are for nailing two pieces of LVL together to make a single beam.  3" OC means 3" on center, or simply one nail every three inches.  <br>  <br>  There should be a bit more to the instructions, standard practice is to place one row of nails about 1 1/2" from the top and another about 1 1/2" from the bottom.  The staggered part means that the nails in one row should not be directly above or below the nails in the other row.  You would start 1 row 1 1/2" from an end and nail every 3", start the other row in 3" and nail every 3".

mwDuaWTFaa	I don't know of any way to take the paint off by itself.  You will need to take a bit of wall with it.  Not as bad as it sounds if you have drywall.<br>  <br>  I would try for  a bit smaller piece -- about 1" x 3/4".  It doesn't sound like much difference, but it is much easier to patch up after your done.  Call the store you are taking the sample to and make sure, but all of the machines I have seen can handle this without a problem.<br>  <br>  Pick a spot in the room that is not real noticeable.  A corner, near the floor is usually good.  Stay about 8" away from the corner, 12" off the floor.  Closer to the corner you will get into the compound used to finish the corner, which you don't want.<br>  <br>  Clean the area well with mild soapy water and dry completely.  The sample must be clean for a good match and you will not be able to clean the sample once it is removed.<br>  <br>  Using a sharp utility knife, score the surface around the sample.  You need to cut just through the paper, not into the core so much.  Use the tip of the knife to slide under the edge of the sample and pull it up.  It should come off without too much effort.<br>  <br>  Use a bit of spackling compound to fill in the hole you created.  You should do this as soon as you take the sample so it can have time to dry before you get back with your matched paint.  It may take a couple of applications to get it level, sanding between and after.  This is where the smaller sample size helps.|`|jipKf0f2aa	If the closet is painted the same as the other walls, get your swatch from the closet.

The second longer answer has some good advice too about cleaning the area first etc...  It really isn't a big deal to remove a 1 x 1 area of paint like one of the other answers was making it out to be. If you want to match the color, then do. Just remove the piece using a utility knife and a putty knife or maybe even a butter knife just to carefully get under the piece to remove it if you don't have a putty knife. Patching the spot will be no big deal.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other questions in Yahoo Answers that talk about matching wall texture for when you want to patch the tiny spot, but really, don't worry about it, you'll do fine, and it won't be noticeable.<br>  <br>  Also, as long as you're careful while removing the piece from the wall, it shouldn't break. The paint will hold it together, especially if there are multiple coats of paint.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1vF7FRtmaa	Go to the paint store sherwin williams M.A.B. and ask for a color fan it will have thousands of shades of everything you will be able to match it this way leave the walls alone when you find the closest color go back to the store and they will mix a small amount so you can take it home and do a test sample and they can also darkin it or lightin it for you for a perfect match !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|TxgEdiyTaa	You might try scoring it with a utility knife and lifting it off with a putty knife.

469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	Unless you're using Benjamin Moore Aura, you need a primer. I've painted over a dozen times with dark red, and it is unlike every other colour you will paint with. It won't cover, it simply WILL NOT, without a dark grey or dark red primer - no matter what any supposed expert says. And I've had experts tell me I should be able to cover with two coats, and doubt either my honesty or my intelligence when I say it doesn't. Trust me: unless you're using Aura, it won't. <br>  <br>  But you only ever need one coat of properly applied primer for any paint job. If the primer is either dark grey or exactly the same colour as the paint, two coats of the top coat will be enough - you might even get by with one coat and touch-ups if you're using dark red primer. If the primer only has a bit of the tint in it (and sometimes they do this - they try to give you pink primer, which makes no sense to me), you need to go back and get it retinted to either dark red or dark grey.|`|4WbGOmaEaa	One coat of primer should be enough. The primer helps hide any spots you miss and helps you apply less coats of actual paint. <br>  <br>  That said, still need 2 coats of paint. The primer will be lighter than the paint. Since the primer is tinted, you will miss spots with your first coat - and you wont notice until dry. The second coat will help this.<br>  <br>  Without the tinted primer, 2 coats probally would not be enough. Happy painting!|`|AA12211963	depends on the existing paint. if it is Gloss or Semi-Gloss I normally rough up the surface with a light sanding first.place 1 coat and check for even coating. if not taking fully coat again.  Flat Paint needs only one good coat of primer and allow to dry thoroughly. Normally we ask what is the existing color but -- you are using a dark color so it almost does not matter|`|AA12163578	Mostly one coat of primer and 2 coats of paint. Red is a hard color to paint. Good luck.|`|mwDuaWTFaa	In reality, zero coats of primer, two coats of paint properly applied will handle this.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know you see advertising that you should prime to mask color and that certainly is the general public impression (even some professional painters) of proper method.  From the advertising standpoint, it is a way to increase sales.  Others don't know any better.<br>  <br>  The chemical makeup of a good primer is designed to do a specific job.  It should "soak in" to the surface being primed and provide a consistent surface to apply your finish paint to.  Some will fill slight imperfections in the wall, others may not.  The main point is a primer needs to soak in.<br>  <br>  If a wall has been previously painted, the surface is already sealed and the primer can't penetrate.  The result is it will not get a good "grip" on the surface.  What this means in terms of your paint job is that your finish coat will be less durable -- when something rubs against it the primer may give a bit and allow the finish coat to develop microscopic tears in the finish surface.  Most people will not recognize the cause of this sitiuation and write it off as normal wear and tear.<br>  <br>  Sealers are a bit different, they will grip to most surfaces and not cause a problem.  Many of the "primers" available today are actually sealers.  Most will not do any harm, but you really should not need them.  <br>  <br>  Both primers and sealers present another problem when tinted to a shade of the final coat.  Neither offers any durability, but when you apply a topcoat of similar color it is hard to identify places that you have not appied the paint thick enough.  If the paint is not thick enough, it will not have a sufficient film strenght to provide a durable finish.<br>  <br>  For some colors, a "masking" coat is helpful, but it should not be a shade of the final color.  For instance, if you were trying to cover your dark red with another color, you should use a masking coat in a shade of green (the opposite of red), but in a similar type of paint as your finish, not a primer.  You should not need a masking coat to cover a neutral color -- white is neutral.<br>  <br>  So, the short version would be two coats of your finish, skip the primer.  If your primer is really a sealer, you can use it without degrading your finish.  Do not skimp on your finish paint.  Your first coat probably will not turn out the full darkness of the red, but it should not look blotchy.  If it is, you have applied it too thin.  The second coat should develop the full color, but it may take as much as two weeks.  Paint will darken considerably as it cures -- especially magentas. <br>  <br>  Sorry this got so long.  I just get frustrated seeing the myths and misinformation spreading about, especially since it has hit advertising (mostly from a primer/sealer manufacturer).

Yes, it certainly would have been better to clean up properly, but exposure to a single bulb should not be a big deal.  The amount of mercury is small, and although you did not ventilate properly the vapor tends to dissipate rather quickly so the amount actually inhaled would be negligible.  There is a certain amount of mercury in the air you breath everyday from pollution, this should not add enough to cause a problem.  In fact, you probably ingest more mercury from a single serving of tuna that you would get from this situation.<br>  <br>  Follow up by wiping down the area with soapy water.  It sounds like you have read the EPA recommendations, you should note that a vacuum cleaner used to clean up a fluorescent bulb should be discarded.   I would have to think about this a bit, because the amount of mercury in the vacuum has to be very minimal.

I would remove the fixture for added safety and to make it a bit easier to get to the parts to clean.<br>  <br>  After the breaker is off, use a small piece of fine sandpaper to clean the small button in the center of the bulb socket until it is a bit shiny.  Also clean any white residue from the sides of the socket.  Blow out any particles left behind with a bit of canned air. <br>  <br>  You should be good at this point, but the problem may come back.  If the problem recurs quickly, you need to replace the fixture with something that will hold up to the conditions a bit better.|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	sounds like faulty wiring. check your wiring and or connection|`|ELSKfMpxaa	Sounds like it keeps getting loose as you say you have to keep tightening the bulb.Are you screwing it in nice n tight or just until it turns on? and is it in a ceiling fan by chance? they have a habit of shaking the bulb loose over time especially if the fan isn't installed properly.|`|M0I56rVTaa	Check the switch.

pfOc5KH7aa	Kilz primer should stick to anything.  If this is peeling down to bare plaster, you've got a moisture problem.  <br>  <br>  If you've got a Harbor Freight in your area, you can get a moisture meter designed for wood for about $20, which will also work on your plaster walls to determine the moisture level.  <br>  <br>  Or-- you can just go ahead and rip out the plaster on the assumption that there's a leak (betcha a nickel there is), and that even if there isn't one, you've got a paint problem that could be easily fixed by putting up new drywall.<br>  <br>  For drywall around a shower/tub, use "green board" - it's specifically designed for use in damp areas (standard drywall turns to mush if it gets wet).  And obviously, identify and fix the source of the moisture before closing up the wall.  It could be the plumbing, but it could also be a roof leak, or even a condensation issue if this is an exterior wall and the house is poorly insulated.|`|mwDuaWTFaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you have a real problem.  It sounds like an earlier layer of paint has not bonded properly.  Adding additional coats of anything will not help and will in fact make the situation worse.  There is no product that will work through the existing layers of coatings and make that bad layer stick.<br>  <br>  You have two options, neither of which is fun.  The first, least expensive option would be to remove the paint down to the layer that is not sticking.  Depending upon what is under that layer, this may actually be easy.  Could also be rather time consuming.  I would try this first -- if it doesn't work or turns out to be more trouble than you want to go to, you can always move on to option 2.<br>  <br>  At this point, you will need to determine why the paint is not sticking.  If it is simply a glossy surface - either gloss paint or coated paneling - you can paint it after proper preparation.  After the offending layer is removed, clean the surface well with 1 cup tri-sodium phosphate per gallon of water, rinse and dry.  Apply one coat of a shellac based primer sealer (BIN by Zinser), allow to dry and paint.<br>  <br>  Moisture getting behind the paint could also cause this kind of peeling.  If this is the case, you will need to address the source of the moisture.  If the walls are in otherwise good condition, you can prepare as noted above and paint once the moisture problem is dealt with.<br>  <br>  The second option would be to put a new wall surface up.  Either a new layer of drywall, some kind of bathroom paneling, maybe even tile.  You will still need to address any moisture problems.  Also, you will need to mechanically fasten anything that you put up with nails.  If you try to glue it, it will also pull the offending layer of paint loose and cause the whole works to fall down and go boom.<br>  <br>  Moisture from inside the bathroom can be a problem, but it should not cause this particular problem unless the moisture is working in behind the wall surface.|`|jh5GqpZvaa	Man  that's is no fun!  Question is your bathroom damp? if so that only adds to your problem of peeling paint.  Scrap off loose paint, prime with latex, coat of clear shellac, allow to dry completely, plaster any uneven surfaces, sand , prime again, and paint with a really good bathroom paint.  Adding a fan to exhaust excess humidity might be a good idea.  If you have questions contact me.
mwDuaWTFaa	If budget is not a concern, LEDs are the way to go.  Good color, very low heat, and dimmable.  Kills the budget.<br>  <br>  Second choice is xenon.  Better color than flourescent, no flicker, dimmable.  Xenon over halogen because the heat output is less and the bulbs are not as fragile.<br>  <br>  Either way, strip lights are much better for under cabinet than puck lights.  Puck lighting tends to be spotty.|`|36a784abd8b1d6f4f59ca8d94a207b5eaa	actually, flourescent would be better than the both of them. While your choices give off plenty of light, it is a centralized, and very hot light. Meaning you have a couple of areas of intense light, but also with an intense amount of heat being given off. Flourescent lights meanwhile, give a more even lighting, generate almost no heat, and are extremely cheap to operate. In fact they require so little power that there is actually little cost in leaving them on around the clock!|`|AA11314177	I would use a compact florescent light. Not only is it very energy efficient but runs cool. Halogen is power hungry and most of the energy goes to the heat being expelled. Xenon requires a ballast due to their high voltage requirement to light and would not recommend it. Today's compact florescent light has more of incandescent hue in color and draws about only 30 watts for equivalent light from a 100 watt incandescent bulb.

Water on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  the spots are likely blossom end rot, caused by a calcium deficiency in the soil.  This is pretty common in container growing because most potting soils do not contain adequate calcium for tomatoes.  Add some garden lime to your soil next time you water.  This will help the end rot.|`|8BdaqPO0aa	Sounds like blossom end rot.  You can put epsom salt or sprinkle a bit of lime in the soil and water to prevent this from occuring.  Also, putting your used coffee grinds in the soil will add nitrogen to the soil which will help growth.  Always water in the morning and make sure your pots have a hole in the bottom.
mwDuaWTFaa	If the finish on the deck is not keeping it from staining, then it is a penetrating type finish and anything that will remove the "stain" will also remove your stain (your finish), or at least dull it a bit.  You will need to use the same product to fill back in, or maybe even clean the whole deck and start over.<br>  <br>  The "stain" should come off with a solution of bleach and TSP.  Gallon of water, quart of bleach, 1/2 cup TSP.  Brush on, scrub a bit with a medium bristle brush.  Let is soak for 20 minutes or so.  Rinse with plenty of clear water.<br>  <br>  If for some reason that solution does not work, a product called oxalic acid (also called "wood bleach") will.  A good home center will have it.  Follow the directions on the box -- although I like to mix it a bit stronger than what it says.|`|193f5b367932b72c7956f5a737554ebeaa	You can't sand pressure treated wood.  It will release toxic dust into the air.  This is a tough question to answer, but quite frankly if your husband is going to get upset with spots on the deck he should never have constructed it from wood.  In a year it will be spotted everywhere.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, however, I would try a pet stain remover from the pet supply store.  I personally use Simple Solution.  Pour it on the spot, and I mean pour so that it is soaked.  Let is soak in and dry out.  I did this w/ cat issues on wood subfloor and it was amazing.  After 24 hours you couldn't even tell there was a stain.  Don't know about pressure treated, but it's worth a try.|`|uECmEkVoaa	You are definately going to have to sand the area. You can then apply matching stain to the same area as which can have a protector in it. A Water seal would be great to apply.

mwDuaWTFaa	If your ridge vents are properly installed and there is no damage, it is not likely that they are the problem.  The fact that they did not leak when installed somewhat eliminates them as the culprit, again assuming no damage.<br>  <br>  This kind of leak is often difficult to track down.  Look for spots in your attic that have been wet, but you may have to get up there when it is actually leaking to track it down.  Although you are seeing water on the ceiling in one spot, many times the water will come in at one point on the roof and run along the sheathing or structural members and come through the ceiling somewhere else.|`|gJf54lOYaa	Use rubber silicone around the vent to prevent leaks. If the man had done the Job right to begin with you would;t have any leaks at all. I've been doing home repairs for 5 years now and not one come back yet.<br>  When I remove the shingles and slide the plate in you just tack on the silicone for extra protection.<br>  Who ever did your vent must of either cut it too wide or didn't remove the shingles properly before installing the vent.|`|9LEHpSSFaa	I wouldn't thinks so either. But if you have an attic i would get up there and see if you can find some water makes. if no attic it very hard to say what it could be without seeing it. water travels so when it comes in one place you could see it on the the other side of you home that why it hard telling. good luck
mwDuaWTFaa	No real answer for you, just some things to think about.<br>  <br>  First, is the shared pond really a pond?  It is becoming common for developments to have a pond on site as part of an erosion control program, which is mandated by the EPA.  These are generally not deep and are often not maintained after the lots are sold.  Make sure you are getting what you expect.<br>  <br>  It is obvious that buying property and building a pond is going to be more expensive given just the cost of the land.  Your 2 acres will cost $42,000, the 4 acres just for the pond would be $40,000.  You do want some extra land to build on, right?<br>  <br>  There are so many variables in the cost of a pond that it is impossible to even guess what the cost would be.  You need to find an excavator with experience building ponds in the area the land is located and ask them to have a look.|`|1pvtJSn2aa	My thinking would be, which place do I like the best and do I want to share it with other people.  I would like being out and using it for myself rather than having to worry about everyone else.
mwDuaWTFaa	Plaster will not cling to wood properly.  You need some kind of "lath" to hold it on.  The most common kind now is diamond lath, an expanded metal sheet.  You nail the lath on then plaster over.  The plaster works through the holes in the lath which allows it to hold.<br>  <br>  The sheets are 27" x 96" and should be available where you buy your plaster.|`|b559fe0a942682ba4527fc5cc46fe362aa	yes you can, sand first with 40 grit paper.|`|m0uqURUBaa	not bare wood
mwDuaWTFaa	The heat from a heat gun is not controllable enough to remove it without causing damage.  Use an iron, the kind you iron clothes with.  Best to use one without the steam holes, but with the holes will work.<br>  <br>  Use a layer of newspaper between the iron and the Formica.  Start with a medium temperature and adjust up until you get the desired effect.<br>  <br>  This is the method that I use to remove sections of laminate from a top if it needs to be replaced due to chips or scratches.  Takes a bit of time, but it should come off clean.<br>  <br>  You will have some adhesive residue left behind.  Lacquer thinner will cut it.  I use it on the backer, if you are cleaning something else you should test to make sure it will not damage the surface.|`|d04ad6c4a178cbc68f3124c780e907a5aa	take a razor and run it along the top of the backsplash to score the wallpaper.|`|78d1fa64e3f5cf69f85929b4e1dc8decaa	Remove the 4" back first!

mwDuaWTFaa	Well, I haven't heard that one yet.  Why would they be banned?<br>  <br>  There is a code issue with some nails, but it has to do with the type of nail, not the brand.  Angle "stick" nails for some time were made with clipped heads.  In order for the nails to fit together in a nice tight stack, part of the head was notched out so the next nail could rest in the notch.  These clipped heads have less surface area, so they are slightly more likely to pull through the material being nailed.  Many companies made their nails this way.<br>  <br>  These nails have been banned in some places for several years.  In response, the nail companies started making substitutes that have offset nail heads which allow the nails to stack but have the same surface area as a standard nail.|`|GBCMJePhaa	The way I heard it was that nail guns that took a black-powder type charge (Remington, etc.) were going to require a license to operate.

mwDuaWTFaa	An anti-oxide grease compound may be present in your fuse sockets.  It keeps different kinds of metals from chemically reacting inside the panel.

mwDuaWTFaa	Coating your existing aluminum windows will help absolutely zero.  To be effective, you would need a thermal break between the aluminum and the heated portion of your house.  Unless you have aluminum storms applied directly to aluminum windows, you should already have some kind of thermal break.  At the end of the day, the aluminum is not really costing you much in terms of energy loss.<br>  <br>  Adding any kind of coating to the storms does not help because it is not between the aluminum and your heated area.<br>  <br>  I can't think of a way you could do this anyway.  Aluminum is incredibly hard to get a coating to stick to and I have never seen a product that would be suitable for this.|`|AA11372747	Plastic coating will not stick to aluminum well.

mwDuaWTFaa	This material can be painted, but it will be a lot of work to do it properly.<br>  <br>  The covering is not vinyl.  It is a glaze made from several chemicals including silicone and teflon.  Those are two of the hardest things to get paint to stick to.<br>  <br>  You will need to sand until all of the gloss is gone.  Every bit of the paneling, including the indented lines if you have them.  You should not sand away the entire coating, just take away the gloss.  I would go with a 100 or 120 grit paper.  Anything heavier will leave marks in your finished paint, lighter will take much longer to get done.  I would consider a vibrating sander for this, not a belt sander.  If you use a sander, do make sure you go back and get the indented parts.<br>  <br>  If there are any spots where the coating is gone, prime with an oil based primer, thinned just a bit to where it is rather runny.  Exterior oil primer will be fine if you can't find interior.  Do not prime areas that still have the coating with this.  The oil primer will need to dry several days before moving on.<br>  <br>  Cover the entire area, including any areas you primed with the oil primer, with a pigmented shellac.  BIN is probably the best, other stain block products will work as long as they are shellac based.  Dry overnight.<br>  <br>  Topcoat with a good latex of your choosing.

Technically, the paint contains latex, which is the base material for many types of rubber.  The latex in paint is usually synthetic.<br>  <br>  Alkyd paints are synthetic oil based.  Cleanup and thinning requires mineral spirits.<br>  <br>  Acrylic is a synthetic plastic resin used in some paints.

As long as you pay attention, I would not be worried.<br>  <br>  The bigger hazard would be from dogs, angry customers and such.  <br>  <br>  $12.00 per hour does seem a bit low but the per meter bonus could add up fairly quickly.  Changing a meter should not take more than a few minutes, unless you have to deal with the aforementioned dogs and/or angry customers.  Your drive time between will impact the amount you are able to get done.  In a rural setting, you may have a few minutes drive between meters, but in an urban setting you should be able to change 6 - 8 per hour.  That could add up.<br>  <br>  Also, are you furnishing your own ride, or do you get a company truck?  If you have to furnish your own, do you get paid for mileage?  This could make a difference as well.|`|AA10416911	all they do is just plug in but you are working around 'hot' or live electrical wires better be careful as you wont be able to turn it off
mwDuaWTFaa	The time to shop around and compare prices is before you sign a contract, not after.  Certainly not after you are 1 year into the project.  You are out of luck so far as the money issue is concerned.<br>  <br>  Material and workmanship defects are another story.  I assume you have talked with your contractor about these things, you need to put your concerns in writing.  Make a list of all things that are wrong and ask him to present you with a written plan to deal with them including a time frame.  If material defects are an issue, you may need to get in touch with the manufacturer to make a claim against their warranty.  Do so soon, as the manufacturer may try to point back to the contractor in which case you need to stay on him to get it resolved.<br>  <br>  Is the project complete?  Your question does not make this clear.  If not, your contract should allow for a payment of the final balance when the project is complete.  The project is not complete until these issues are resolved, so it would be proper to hold part of the final payment until they are taken care of.<br>  <br>  If your project is complete and you have problems, do not hesitate to contact the Better Business Bureau in your area.  They can't force a solution, but they are often helpful in resolving issues.  If that fails, you may have to sue the contractor which is not fun, but you will have much better luck if you document things now.  Documenting would include the list of items you present to the contractor and his response (or lack thereof).  Also take pictures.|`|AA10274310	you contact your state's Contractor's License Board you can file a complaint with them - you can also get their bonding information - and you can even file a bond claim against their bond. feel free to contact me if you need further assistance.|`|zr8iFvqPaa	Unfortunately, you should have done your research and price comparisons prior to signing a contract.  As for the defects, you may have to retain an attorney.  Always get at least 3 bids, ask for references and check those references out.
mwDuaWTFaa	Exterior grade oil primer.<br>  <br>  Make sure the lumber is completely dry before painting.  The treating process puts a significant amount of water in the wood, it can take a few months to dry out.  Also, it is common for manufacturers to put a water repellent sealer on this type of product at the treating plant.  If present, it needs to come off before you paint.<br>  <br>  After priming with oil primer, you may paint after completely dry with an oil paint.  If you are using a latex based paint, you will need to wait at least 2 days for the primer to dry completely.  There is no problem with latex over an oil primer other than this and it is much easier to deal with.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you cover all surfaces of the fence when painting for best results.  Don't forget the bottom edge of the pickets.|`|d5a25fdc6fb2ab11185662388b3b3b75aa	the new latex based exterior primers are excellent. If they stick to the fence like they do to my skin and hair then they should do the trick. Oil is always good, but I think that these days the latex based are just as good if not better. For the average do it yourselfer the latex is probably less irritating to use also. Good luck and may you never have to paint your fence again. Remember 2 coats of finish is always best. Take your time and use top grade products(that is brushes, rollers and paint) They may be a little expensive but will make your job go easier and last longer.|`|AA11122932	do not use any latex based primers on pressure treated lumber. USE OIL BASED.  With latex the material used to treat the lumber will bleed through and caused yellowing.  Use a high quality oiled based product.  I use oil based exterior KILZ...it is cheap and fast drying...1 hour.  Then use an good quality oiled based paint as topcoat.  Do this and you will be happy with the results with smiles and grins as wide and bright as a rainbow,
mwDuaWTFaa	Several problems here.  <br>  <br>  Treating products used up through the 1990s (maybe even into this century, can't remember the date) used chemicals that can break down and leave an arsenic residue.  Arsenic is certainly not good.<br>  <br>  If the house is really built from landscape timbers, I would be concerned about the structure.  Landscaping timbers generally are not designed for structural use.  Often material that has structural defects is used for landscape timbers, so it is never a good idea to build anything substantial from them.<br>  <br>  The biggest risk comes with a fire.  If they burn, the chemicals certainly will create some health problems for those fighting the fire.  Given the quantity that would be involved, may cause some problems for the neighbors as well.<br>  <br>  I would not want to live there.|`|AA11603761	Termites|`|AA11799144	Depends on the age. Up until just a few years ago they were primarily treated with arsenic, and I know a guy who built a very elaborate and huge gazebo in his back yard, he got sick, and they could not figure out what was wrong with him.  Eventually they discovered he had absorbed a lot of the arsenic from the treated wood. Ended up having to have both feet amputated since the heavy metal settled there.|`|PgiKU8gdaa	The danger could come if you use treated wood for your fireplace, or compost pile. If you burn it, the process could release arsenic and other toxic materials so you should not use those ashes in your garden.
mwDuaWTFaa	If there is any plastic on the inside of the window (not between the glass) such as grilles or a glazing bead, the extra heat could be a problem.  Also could be a problem for vinyl windows due to the extra heat trapped between the blinds and the window.  It should not be a problem for the glass units, they are designed to take a fair amount of heat.
Nk0J93dVaa	I replace about one hundred lamps (bulbs) a week and about five ballasts. It is not uncommon for me to get as many as six lamps in a box of 30 that are just plain no good. <br>  If you know that the lamps are good then the ballast is the culprit. Almost all of the modern fixtures are quick start and dont use starters. <br>  The most modern fixtures use electronic ballasts as opposed to electromagnetic. Many fixtures are as cheap as the replacement ballast. What this means to the average person is that its worth replacing the entire fixture in most cases where the old one is over five years old and accessible. Sometimes the fixture is installed in a way that it is too big of a hassle to change out. In these cases replace the ballast with one of the newer electronic types. They use less power, generate less heat and are more reliable.The ballast is not hard to change and it even has color coded wires with (most of the time) a wiring diagram right on the part. <br>  This will be an easy and rewarding project that will help you build up some confidence for the next larger project.<br>  Good Luck.|`|mwDuaWTFaa	Most likely the ballast has malfunctioned.  You can buy a replacement ballast. Remove the cover from the fixture wiring trough.  The ballast is a black rectangular device with wires coming out.  There should be a sticker on it with all of the required information.  Write down everything and take it to a home center.<br>  <br>  Replacement is a matter of cutting the wires going to the ballast and connecting the wires of the new ballast, color to color with wire nuts.  Not too difficult at all.<br>  <br>  Do keep in mind that you need to turn off the breaker or remove the fuse for the circuit any time you will be working on a light fixture.  Turning off the switch is not sufficient to provide the needed level of safety.<br>  <br>  Also, check the price of a new fixture.  You may find the fixture is cheaper than the ballast, especially if it is an inexpensive fixture.|`|FYjgmJ6Taa	change BOTH the bulbs at the same time. <br>  <br>  or change the ballast.|`|53df783623fcbe02d3e217231acfb0cfaa	First check your wire connectors to make sure the blue, red and yellow wires are connected. Typically this is the problem. If not then change ou the ballast. With the world turning green you should upgrade to a T 8 ballast and T8 lamps which are 32 Watts and put out more light.|`|e6fb73e95b70d4c27831434733f0e07faa	Check for supply voltage in the fixture.  If voltage is present and all wire connections are good.....then you need a new ballast.  I recommend going ahead and replacing that ballast with a T-8 ballast rather than the old T-12 style.  T-12 bulbs are on their way out due to the high mercury content.  They are not that hard to replace and most of them have a schematic on the ballast.  It can be a little confusing, but take your time and use your brain.  You cut the wires from the old one and use wire nuts for the new one.  Do not try to replace the wires at the tombstone (the part where the end of the bulb slides in to the fixture....looks like a tombstone).
mwDuaWTFaa	The reason for wattage limitations with traditional bulbs is the risk of heat from the bulb causing damage to the fixture or fire.  You are correct that the CFL will produce significantly less heat, however CFLs have a bit different reason for specific limitations.  <br>  <br>  A traditional florescent fixture uses an external ballast to provide energy to the bulb at a higher voltage and frequency than standard line current.  In a CFL, the ballast electronics are much more compact and are included in the bulb base.  If the ballast becomes too hot, it can malfunction.  CFLs have a heat sensor that cuts power internally if the temperature becomes too high, so when operated in a fixture that does not allow for sufficient heat dissipation they will go off.  Some will come back on when cooled, others will not.<br>  <br>  This situation is a bit worse with a dimmable bulb as the ballast is different.  The extra electronics required generates additional heat and is more sensitive to heat.<br>  <br>  I doubt using these bulbs in a recessed fixture would cause a fire but would not guarantee they would not.  I would expect to see them fail prematurely.|`|9i8pKpvgaa	CFLs create too much heat to be used in an enclosed recessed fixture, although; CFLs can be used in outdoor recessed fixtures if the package says that the buld can be used outdoors, if not don't use it.

98iua0mOaa	Gas will be cleaner to run ,but cost between oil and gas is not to different. Plus with oil you can chose where to buy it from. Heat Pumps are only good for Florida states and work not too well in severe cold temps(below 32 deg) and are no way better than gas or oil heat ! The electric bill will kill you!`|`|mwDuaWTFaa	If you have to replace the AC, you should certainly consider a heat pump.  The heat pump equipment would be installed in place of the AC unit.  Both the outside unit and the coil inside would need to be replaced.  Usually the unit can be fitted into your existing air handler (furnace).  The cost difference for a heat pump vs AC is minimal vs the benefit.  Heat pumps are not efficient as the outside temp drops, but a heat pump can carry the load on cool days for considerably less expense than a traditional furnace.  Your furnace will heat on colder days.<br>  <br>  If the furnace is that new, it is probably fairly efficient and there is no reason to replace it.  People that are used to oil or gas heat usually are not happy with electric as the air is not as hot coming out of the ducts and it just doesn't feel warm.<br>  <br>  Both oil and gas prices will continue to go up, it is hard to predict which will out pace the other.  Not sure what the electric regulation situation is where you are, but electric prices may be a bit more stable.  Switching would be a gamble at best and you really would not gain much in the way of efficiency.<br>  <br>  If you really want to get away from the oil, you may want to consider a geothermal system.  It is a sizable investment on the front end, but the cost is usually recovered in 10 years or less.  These systems also have a fairly warm output temp, so the perceived warmth is not an issue.  There are some places that they simply will not work due to space limitations or soil conditions, but you should at least check with a dealer if you are determined to change your furnace.  The geo would handle your cooling needs as well.|`|783c5048fb1231430dec2c582ea9ec8caa	If you are going to replace the A/C system, definitely put in a heat pump. The oil furnace can stay and the heat pump can be installed with the existing furnace.<br>  Have the thermostat replaced with a dual fuel thermostat, which is programmable to run the heat pump to a programmed outdoor temperature, then turn the furnace on when it gets really cold and the heat pump becomes less effective to run.<br>  Being that the oil furnace is relatively new, it would probably not make sense to install gas. Unless there is a gas line very close to your house, the gas company is likely to charge a pretty penny to run gas up to the house. Plus you'll have to have a plumber to run the gas line to your appliance(s). These expenses plus the cost of installing a new gas furnace will probably not make sense as your payback will take several years.<br>  It would probably be preferable to have gas because of the extra maintenance needed for oil furnaces, but if you had a heat pump with the oil, you would be much happier with using less oil.<br>  I did this for my parents some years back. They have a 2500 square foot house and barely use a 275 tank of oil in a heating season and with the high efficiency heat pump, they have been happy with their bills.

After a couple hours you can return and get some fresh air down there again.|`|m5YbvzHLaa	Yes,eventually.

mwDuaWTFaa	BIN will stop the bleeding.  You should be able to paint over the latex, you just need to make sure it is cured and adhearing to the surface well.<br>  <br>  First, let that latex cure well.  It will be dry to the touch fairly quickly, but will continue to cure for as long as a month.  I would wait at least a week to allow it to build some more bonding strength.<br>  <br>  Test before you use the BIN (or anything else, for that matter).  Buy some utility masking tape -- the old fashioned  white tape -- not blue, not painters tape.  You need something with decent glue.  Width does not matter so much, 3/4" or 1" is fine.  Place a strip on the wall, 3" or so, bend a bit of it under so you have a tab to grab onto.  Let this set up for an hour or so.<br>  <br>  After the tape has set for a bit, grab the tab and pull off the wall with a firm motion, keeping the tape as purpendicular to the wall as you can.  If the tape comes off clean, you are in great shape.  If you get a bit of paint, wait a few more days and try again -- it may get better.<br>  <br>  It is important to let the primer cure fully -- not just dry -- because the BIN will slow the curing process considerably and may break the bond between the primer and the wall.  The primer will also be a bit softer until it is cured fully, so your finish coat will not be as durable.  Again, the curing will slow a great deal once the BIN is on.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you should be fine to put the BIN over your latex.  It will grip to the latex, you just have to make sure the latex is gripping the surface well.  Just be patient.|`|FpmnYeknaa	Also, keep in mind that BIN is a shellac, not a paint.  Use it for spot priming the areas that are bleeding, since it is more brittle than latex and can easily crack under stress.  <br>  <br>  You may want to try Bulls Eye 1-2-3 from Zinsser to prime over the entire surface.
mwDuaWTFaa	First, I really wonder if the chalking you are seeing is coming from a previous layer of paint or if it is coming from the actual wall surface.  Are you sure the walls were ever painted?<br>  <br>  Drywall should not chalk like this, but old plaster, left unpainted for years, can develop conditions that will cause it to chalk.  Corrective action would depend upon the type of plaster, age, and the cause of the chalking.  If this might be the case, you need to address stabilizing the plaster before you think about paint.  You will need someone familiar with plaster to take care of this for you, as it is impossible to properly assess this without physically inspecting the wall.<br>  <br>  If you are sure it is paint chalking, then you should be able to do this yourself.   The TSP is the right way to go.  You need to get as much of the chalking off before you go any further.  Your TSP should be mixed to the strongest concentration listed on the box, I would go a bit stronger.  Do not use a sponge for this step -- use a stiff, natural bristle brush with a handle (often called an acid brush because masonry contractors use them with acid to clean brick).  Start at the top and work down.  Spend a little bit of time scrubbing, you need to loosen as much of the chalk as you can.  <br>  <br>  Don't forget to rinse.  Rinse while the wall is still damp with the TSP solution -- don't try to wash it all then rinse -- small sections at a time.  Do use a large sponge for the rinsing.  Again start at the top, wipe down.  Wipe, rinse your sponge, wipe again.  The sponge should come off fairly clean when you are properly rinsed.<br>  <br>  After washing and rinsing, you should be ready to prime.  The surface should be dry, but don't wait too long as you don't want to give the surface time to chalk.<br>  <br>  This is one of the few situations where it is necessary to prime a previously painted surface.  Again working with the assumption that the paint is chalking, not the wall surface, the previous paint is having problems.  The chalk you see is actually the pigment in the paint coming unglued from the wall.  Could be because of really cheap paint, over-thinned paint, defective paint (it does happen somtimes), or the wrong paint for the application.  Ceiling paint on a wall will do this sometimes, but I have never seen it as bad as what you are describing (based upon your previous questions as well).  The important part is the pigment particles are not properly glued to the wall.<br>  <br>  Selection of the primer is important here.  To make sure it sticks, you need something with good gripping power but also some extra binders (glue) that will absorb the loose pigment and bond it to the wall.  Your previous attempt used a primer that has good grip, good blocking, but not a lot of extra binders.  <br>  <br>  I would look for a good PVA primer.  You do not want something with a lot of pigment, you already have more than you need.  Many primers that are marketed to consumers as being the best have a lot of pigment so they cover well.  If you look at them in the can, they tend to be thick and cover as well or better than paint when applied.  You want a more traditional primer, which will look translucent as you apply it to the wall, a bit thinner than normal paint in the bucket.  I have never touched any of the Behr products, but my guess would be that their primers will fall into the heavy-bodied category.  You will have better luck at a paint store.  Also, do not add any tint to this primer.  It can help with color clarity, but in this case you want the least amount of pigment in the primer possible.<br>  <br>  As you prime, pay attention to your equipment.  If there is still a fair amount of chalk, you will tend to pull some off into your roller as you paint.  If you notice the consistency of your primer getting a bit thicker as you go, stop and wash it out.  You will waste primer, but it will minimize the amount of the chalk that you are putting back on the wall.<br>  <br>  Wait a bit longer than the instructions dictate before you try to do anything after you prime.  I would give it at least two days before you touch it to give the primer the best chance to cure.  After a couple of days, do the tape test and see how it looks.  If it is good, go ahead with your finish coat.  If it pulls off, take the chip to the store where you bought the primer.  This is another good reason to find a good paint store.  The store can send the chip to the manufacturer for an analysis, which will identify what the material is that is chalking and give you another clue toward solving the problem.|`|ENJdSv9faa	I'd just try a damp soapy sponge and dry it when you're done. It'll be easier to clean up if the wall has glossy paint.
mwDuaWTFaa	The sale of propane is not regulated like other utilities often are because there are several suppliers in most areas -- you are on your own to shop around a bit and get the best deal you can.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of things that effect the price you pay.  First is the tank.  Propane tanks are fairly expensive.  Generally you can either buy your own tank(s) or have the propane company supply them.  If you buy your own, you can get propane from one company for one fill then have another company fill the next time.  This gives you the advantage of shopping for the best price every time you buy fuel.<br>  <br>  The other issue is the cost of the tank itself.  If you buy your own, you have to pay the cost when you get the tanks.  If you get your tank from the gas company, you still have to pay for the tank.  In this case it is either added to the cost of the fuel.  Under this arrangement, you generally have to buy a certain amount of fuel per year to keep the tank.  This will cost much more over a period of time, but you don't have to come up with the money to buy the tank all at once.<br>  <br>  An issue not related to the cost of the tank is your price cap.  To get a cap, you have to agree to buy a minimum amount of fuel.  When you do this, the gas company will buy propane futures or options so they don't suffer losses if the price goes up considerably.  Basically, they are capping the price they will pay as well.  This is usually done over the summer.  You will recall that prices were high this summer (propane trends with gas), so the prices that were established over the summer were higher than the market now.  This situation is not good for you now, but if prices had gone up -- and it looked likely that they would -- then you would be benefiting substantially.  If prices had gone up as expected, some of those neighbors would be paying $4 a gallon or more while you would be paying 2.849.<br>  <br>  Short version, if you want the best price, it is best to buy your own tank.  A contract to cap the price is usually a good idea, it just didn't work that way this time.|`|iam79Xpzaa	Supply and demand|`|7oYUan7zaa	propane nightmares init ;)

In little things for decoration, and to brighten the room up.. make it smell nice..<br>  <br>  Actually, a great thing is to put oil in the potpourri, it just really "grabs" the fragrance and it smells pretty..

First, you must have a large glass bowl or jar.  Then, string Christmas lights into the jar/bowl.  As you do this, pour the Potpourri into it (mixing it while you string in the lights).  Then, after all is through, turn on the lights and the heat from the lights will cause the aroma of the Potpourri to fill the room.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to place it in a decorative bowl and put on your toilet seat in a bathroom.  The small area of the bathroom will allow the aroma of the Potpourri to help with "unwanted" smells.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you could put the Potpourri in a sock or underwear drawer after sealing it in lace bag.  This would enable nice smells to come from a drawer when opened.|`|DeoDkG1Waa	Whilst it would look pretty, I do not think the suggestion to put it with Christmas lights in a vase is a good idea.

c2858b4ba147f1d5865446a625e5722faa	This is a serious problem; do NOT let it sit there, it will only get worse.  (People who rent out those "Moon Walks" for parties complain about this a lot!)  <br>  <br>  Answer:  use WD-40 (the spray lubricant, sold in every hardware store).  Let it soak in for 10 minutes, it'll turn gummy and easy to rub off. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, use "Goof Off" or "Goo-Gone Cleaner", which are solvents (you can buy them at Home Depot, Lowe's).    This is more toxic, so use it only if WD-40 doesn't work. <br>  <br>  Other products I've seen recommended include 3M's Wax and Adhesive Remover, and "DX440" made by "PPG" -- both available in auto paint supply stores.  I haven't tried them. <br>  <br>  But try the WD-40 first (cheaper, less toxic).  <br>  <br>  Silly string is especially bad on plastics (like toys), vinyl (like moon walks), and car paint.

I always wash on 60deg Centigrade to kill dust mites.  Incidentally, if you shake your sheets after using them do not do it in the bedroom, do it outside.  The reason is you will just shake the dust mites all over the bedroom.  If I were rich I would have clean sheets every day.

mwDuaWTFaa	100 cans of spray paint is not nearly enough to get a deal from a manufacturer, or even get one to sell to you for that matter.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is a local paint dealer.  You may be able to negotiate a discount for this kind of quantity.  Probably have better luck at a locally owned establishment than one of the big boxes.
mwDuaWTFaa	The most likely culprit is a toilet.  If the flapper in the tank does not seal perfectly, water can run into the bowl very slowly.  When the water level in the tank drops to a certain level, the fill valve will open for a bit to top it off.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to see a small leak like this, a good test is to put a few drops of food coloring in the toilet tank and wait a few minutes.  If any color gets into the bowl, you have a small leak and your flapper needs to be adjusted.  This is not at all uncommon for a new fixture to need a bit of adjustment.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is your water heater.  The tank has a pressure relief valve that discharges water if the pressure exceeds a safe level.  If your water heater temperature is high, the relief valve may be relieving pressure from time to time, indicating that you need to set the temp a bit lower or have your heater serviced.  It is also possible that the valve is defective, opening at a pressure lower than it should.<br>  |`|HIvDN7T0aa	Do you notice it when you're in or near the kitchen?  Do you have an automatic ice maker in your refrigerator?  5-10 seconds sounds about right for filling the tray.<br>  <br>  |`|FIVykMAgaa	i agree, its probably a flapper. they warp over time and wont seal properly. when this happens, after the tank level drops 1 to 2 inches, the fill valve will come back on and fill the tank again. flappers are very inexpensive so i would replace them all.

mwDuaWTFaa	You seem to have the right general idea.  A few notes:<br>  <br>  Double check your wire size.  If the circuit you are using is on a 15 amp breaker, 14 gauge wire is fine.  If it is a 20 amp, #12 is required.<br>  <br>  There is no need to cut and nut the white wire in the junction box.  Just run it through, leave a bit of slack in case you need it later.<br>  <br>  Grounding depends upon the switch.  Some have ground connections, some do not.  I would buy one that is grounded given a choice.  If yours has a green ground screw, you will need to cut the green wire, cut a 4" pigtail from a scrap.  Tie the two ends of the cut ground wire together with one end of the pigtail with a green nut or other ground connector.  Attach the other end of the ground pigtail to the switch.  If you don't have a ground connection on the switch, simply run the ground wire through with some slack in the junction box in case a replacement switch does have a ground.<br>  <br>  The ground wire should be connected to the light fixture as well, either to a green grounding screw or a green or bare wire.  Porcelain and a few other fixtures might not have a ground connection, in which case the ground wire should be attached to a metal box.|`|DhdLNxQBaa	That will work.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Or you can run the black white and green straight to the light.  Hook the white to the white on the fixture.  Take another section of the romex and hook the black to the black and the white to the black on the light fixture (mark it with black tape).  Run that section of cable back to the switch and hook the white and black to the 2 poles on the switch (again mark the white wire with black tape).<br>  <br>  It's just breaking the hot (black) wire in a more convenient location and eliminates the need to wire nut the neutral (white).This way is sometimes easier depending on how you have to fish the wires through the wall.<br>  <br>  Hook all of the greens to ground.

A screw can be thought of as an inclined plane (another simple machine) wrapped around a cylinder.<br>  <br>  The lower end of the device is put in the water, and the screw is then turned (usually by a windmill or by manual labor). As the bottom end of the tube turns, it scoops up a volume of water. This amount of water will slide up in the spiral tube as the shaft is turned, until it finally pours out from the top of the tube and feeds the irrigation systems.<br>  <br>  The interface between the screw and the pipe does not need to be perfectly water-tight because of the relatively large amount of water being scooped at each turn in respect to the angular speed of the screw. Also, water leaking from the top section of the screw leaks into the previous one and so on, so a sort of equilibrium is achieved while using the machine, thus preventing a decrease in efficiency.<br>  <br>  The "screw" does not necessarily need to turn inside the casing, but can be allowed to turn with it in one piece. A screw could be sealed with pitch or some other adhesive to its casing, or, cast as a single piece in bronze, as some researchers have postulated as being the devices used to irrigate Sennacherib's Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Depictions of Greek and Roman water screws show the screws being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece, which would require that the casing be rigidly attached to the screw.|`|2abf7c9aa2a4522ef7b180b3d4ac6e43aa	Look at the following web page and you will have a complete parts list and operating instructions.<br>  <a href="http://www.thefarm.org/charities/i4at/surv/handpump.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefarm.org/charities/i4at/su...</a>|`|AA10923152	a hand pump? well for a simple pump you'll need an intake and outlet valve and a plunger so when you pull the plunger up, the intake valve is open and water is brough into the chamber and then the intake valve closes and the outlet opens and when you push the plunger back down then it pushes the water out of the chamber and out the outlet.

The more you shake it, the fluffier the Flokati gets. <br>  <br>  You may also lightly spritz the rug with cold water, using a sprayer such as a plant mister.<br>  <br>  To give the rug a softer feel and texture, you may comb your Flokati with a wide-toothed plastic hairbrush or pet brush. Brush the pile from the center of the rug outward in four directions. Some wool fibers may come out in the brush. However, this is normal and not harmful to your Flokati.<br>  <br>  After brushing, shake the rug one more time.

0b634d44436884ecec919bd12b9ac69daa	I asked this question myself, but for a pair of trousers. My trousers had that unmistakable iron marking but did not actually have any brown burn marks. Yahoo answers helped to diminish this mark considerably. One idea was to rub the mark with ice - I did and it showed some improvement. Another idea was to rub the mark vigorously with vinegar (testing in a hidden area first). I used white vinegar. This really helped, although my trousers were a bit whiffy! I have washed them and the mark has really diminished and I don't think that anyone else will notice it now. I'm not sure which worked best or it might have been a combination of both.

Use gloves and eye protection as the TSP will burn if you have a cut or get it in the eyes.  After you have cleaned, if the problem is solved, finish with a good quality urethane.

Therefore, Silk Road and its staff cannot be responsible for the results you achieve. The suggestions below are just that: suggestions.<br>  Coffee & Tea<br>  Remove fresh stains from cotton and linen materials by first rinsing in warm water then pouring boiling water from a height of 2 - 3 feet onto the stain. Follow by washing in hot soapy water. If a trace remains, bleach white garments in the sun, or with a diaper wash/sanitizer container sodium percarbonate. Tea stains on cottons and linens can also be removed by soaking in borax and water (1 Tbsp. borax per cup of warm water).<br>  <br>  Stains on wool and silk or any fabric may be sponged with lukewarm water, then apply glycerine, rubbing lightly between the hands. Let stand for half an hour. Rinse with warm water.

There are no recycling factories there, there is one city who LIVES off of, and actually AMONGST, all this garbage. It gets dumped off of ships, then thousands of people empty the bags by hand. Garbage is everywhere. No face masks, no shoes,... moms, dads, kids all live their lives sorting this garbage. Babies crawl through this stuff while moms separate old pasta bags from water bottles. Boys and dads spend 14 hours a day in cellars where they produce plasic hose from old plastic.
