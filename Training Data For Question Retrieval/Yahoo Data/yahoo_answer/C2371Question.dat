I would love to work abroad helping people/animals/the world  for a charity. The only problem I have is that I don't have the money to pay the large fees that a lot of these companies ask for.      Apart from that I am a very creative person I love designing things and drawing, but I always doubt my own talent and think I am not good enough, but back when I was in school I was one of the best in my art class. But since being out of school my confidence has faded. I love music, its my main passion in life, but so many people study music and there are very little jobs in it so I don't see the point in studying this.      The main problem I have is drive, I cant seem to stick college courses because I always have to work to support myself and the job and getting money usually ends up taking priority.       I just have such a hunger to travel the world and help people or animals ... god that sounds so hippyish!! But money is an issue for me. I am due to start a college course for Teaching English as a foreign language. I am very excited about this because there are plenty of job oppertunities working abroad, I guess I'll wait and see what happens.      But yeah theres my background, any career ideas would help.      Thanks in advance.      No internet scam websites please

I am currently taking a BSC International Business, Finance and Economics course at University, well into my second year, after completing a Business Diploma at College where I achieved a DDM (the equivalent of AAC at A-Level).       However, I am really not enjoying the course. Deep down, I think I have picked the wrong course for me. The trouble is, i've already put a lot of money into it and it'll seem stupid of me to drop out now. My grades are hovering between a 2:2 and Third on average, and I am finding it difficult and often feel quite scattered with it all.      I think I want to go into Accountancy, would it be possible to get a decent job within that field without a degree?      Has anyone been in a similiar predicament? What actions did you take? Surely dropping out isn't the end of the world? Maybe I could transfer course going into my final year to see if I can achieve a higher degree? Presuming your final year are the results that really matter?      Any advice would be great. Thanks in advance.

Ma l'insegnante che aveva scelto questo metodo per fargli capire di aver sbagliato, è stata denunciata dai genitori del giovane e ora rischia due mesi di carcere.       Il pm Ambrogio Cartosio ha infatti chiesto per la professoressa una detenzione di due mesi, pena sospesa, per abuso di mezzi di correzione. La risposta della docente di Lettere, trent'anni di insegnamento alle spalle, sarebbe stata infatti sproporzionata rispetto al comportamento del suo alunno dodicenne. Un ragazzino vivace che, all'inizio dell'anno scolastico, aveva impedito a un coetaneo di entrare in bagno coprendolo di insulti omofobici.

20070522023617AAAeNd3	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Perchè nemmeno i laureati in lettere sanno più parlare italiano corretto?	Sembra paradossale ma è così, ci sono laureati in lettere che non azzeccano i congiuntivi, che usano vocaboli dialettali, che scrivono la H dove non va messa e la scrivono dove va messa... come è possibile? Non dovrebbero essere i depositari della lingua italiana corretta, persone che hanno letto molto e di riflesso hanno anche imparato a scrivere bene? Colpa della scuola che non insegna più una cippa di buon italiano e di conseguenza lo studente si porta all'università le cattive abitudini prese dalla prima elementare in poi? O colpa delle famiglie che non parlano nemmeno loro buon italiano? Delle chat, degli sms, della tv? Della scarsa propensione alla lettura di quotidiani? Non parlo di libri perchè per laurearsi in lettere bisogna leggerne parecchi...

She could hear her parents discussing her punishment all the way from upstairs.  “Her grades are dropping” “She might not pass.” “This is the third call from Principal Spokes this marking period.” Sammy heard the bits of conversation about her and her school.  She pulled her pillow over her head and let out a huge sob.  Then she heard her parents’ footsteps coming closer and closer to her room.  “Sammy, we need to have a discussion with you.” Sammy braced herself for the usual speech.  “We’re transferring you to East High Elementary school.”  Sammy just stared at her parents in utter disbelief .  “We think at East High you will improve your grades and study skills.” Her parents met Sammy’s stare and glared at her.  “Now stay in your room and start studying.”  Sammy grabbed her cell phone and called her best friend Amanda.  Amanda picked up on the third ring, as usual.  “Hey Amanda, it’s Sammy.”

20070518080213AADfqZ7	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Were you born to design? (A general question for all u architects, industrial and other designers out there)?	I was recently reading an article on the relationship between one's birth order and their education and professional successes. The article implied that many things including personality and range of success can be greatly effected by the order in which you are born.      This lead me to wonder, is a love of design something an individual is born with or is it something the pick up in their youth? Many things influence us as we grow from our parents personal interests to new fashions and the media. However it is true that some of us have a particularly sharp eye for great design. Take the talents of such great architects as Frank Lloyd Wright or Frank Gehry - can their level of design talent be taught or was it simply apart of their genetic make-up at birth?      When considering this, also analyse your own design traits - what comes easy for you and what doesn't. Were you born to be a designer or did you just fall in love with the field?

20090227102233AAWtKLC	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Does anyone know about...?	Tornadoes? I need help on a project. Here is what I have so far. needs to be 3-5 pages.      Tornadoes across the U.S         I picked this topic because after watching the movie Twister and watching Storm chasers on the T.V. I became interested in tornadoes. The sigh of watching a tornado on the Discovery channel is overly amazing to me; this is how I picked my Geography paper. Also the intense feeling I get when I watch Twister for the first time. I really think it's amazing to watch tornadoes but horrible to find out that people have died in Tornadoes storms. Tornadoes are nature’s disaster. Tornadoes occurrence is in March through May, some during late February. Also in northern states some tornadoes occur during the summer. Tornadoes are most likely between 3 and 9 P.M but have been known to occur at all hours. Sometimes there is more than one tornado at one time. Sometimes there are three touch downs in one state. Tornadoes winds speed can be up to 318 MPH or 509 KM/H. Today in 2009 on February 18, 2009 at least three tornadoes touched down in central Georgia. One person was killed and at least 16 were injured. At least 10 people were injured and as many as 100 structures were damaged in Jasper County. Two other twisters touched down in Taylor County and at Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins, south of Macon. There is much different type of Tornadoes. Some are big, small, and extremely big. Some are called Funnels, twisters, tornadoes, dust storms. I learned in July 1643 Governor John Winthrop described a sort of wind gust that could have possibly been one of the first recorded tornadoes in history. Also here are the Top Five Deadliest US Tornadoes: Number one: The Tri-State Tornado on March 18, 1925. Death toll: 695, Injuries: 2027. Number two: The Natchez Tornado on May 7, 1840 Death toll: 317, Injuries: 109. Number three: The St. Louis/East St. Louis Tornado on May 27, 1896 Death Toll: 255, Injuries: 1000. Number four: The Tupelo Tornado on April 5, 1936 Death Toll: 233 Injuries: 700. Number five: The Gainesville Tornado on April 6, 1936. Death Toll: 203 Injuries: 1600.

He wears his wings in his bag,   Dreams and reflects on someone,   But in the picture he has to live    Very severely in someone's short coat.   He's searching for a girl who doesn't forgive,    Doesn't betray and doesn't let go,   This girl exists, but I don't know her   And can only promise that...   I'll learn to fly to heaven with you   Where stars are talking about love with their bodies,   I'll surely meet him there,   Burst into tears and won't even notice   His lips kissing not my hands.      I didn't know how to express my happiness with short words,   Couldn't even utter "Hi!"   But now I'm even with you:   Just look at my lipstick, shoes and dress.   I don't need to speak to you,   To forgive and begin loving again   And I'm the princess here just because I promised that...   I said I'd learn to fly,   I so much lacked courage, foolishness or height,   I was bursting with tenderness, but no one could hear it-   I eventually had been taught but not in the way you wanted to,   But I'm closer this way,   Look!

"Internet media has been growing steadily over newspaper media and may soon become the paramount medium of news, current events, and information."

20090225093235AAGpkCd	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Reporting GRE scores LATE?!! Please advise!?	Georgetown contacted me today saying they want my "GRE scores faxed/sent ASAP" the thing is, I still haven't taken the test and am scheduled to take it for the first time next week. I am scared that if I tell them this, they won't consider me given that "for some reason" they haven't processed my application since it was incomplete and after I reminded them yesterday, they asked for the GRE scores. What to do? How to be pragmatic without put my chances (if I have any) at risk? I was told (by a friend) that they already started interviewing.. So?? What do you think?

I took a year out from university, as I had quite a few health problems, and it was causing an unbelievable amount of stress. I don't return until Jan 2010, but on reflection I am starting to become really worried about fitting in and making new friends. I was quite close to my friends that I studied my first year with, and Im worried about the cliques,and the groups..    Its a London university too, so its not one of the friendliest ones...       I know its a long way off, but I have no idea how I will settle in. Has anybody else been in this situation?
