20090219230340AAnJ1hK	Social Science;Sociology	Is it not a social evil?-?	Genital-genital sex.sometimes referred to as GG rubbing, is generally understood as sexual intercourse in a narrower sense, and among samesex partners vanilla sex. Sex by mutual genital rubbing is sometimes grouped with 'frottage'. However, other terms like 'non-penetrative' or 'outercourse' are heterosexist in reference and misleadingly assume a penile-vaginal context.   how it is satisfication yielding to participants?is it a sort of addiction?   is it not a social evil?      Frot or frottage â€“ two males mutually rubbing penises together

20090219225921AAM0mPs	Social Science;Psychology	Why did it feel so good to wet the bed?	Im 19 , female and always had weird sexual thoughts. When I was little I would hide under a blanket and pretend that my dollys were having sex any stuff even though I never knew really what sex was I only knew a boy got on top of a girl and then bla bla bla happens and a baby is made I was as young as 6 when I did this and it would sexually excite me and I even thought about kissing and having sexual thoughts about boys in my grade 1 class thats how young I was when I got into this stuff but I never did anything. Well accually I had always been interested in deliberately peeing my pants and even peeing in odd places and every couple years I would go from trying stuff like this out with myself when I was alone to forgetting all about it.       Then I stoped purposely peeing my pants sense I was 11 or 12 years old. My parents never knew I liked to wet myself of course and I always took care of any mess I made so they never knew anything.       Then a little while ago I woke up after having dreams about sex but theses dreams of sex involved wetting and peeing on each other and stuff. So I was in a frisky mood and decided to pee my bed for the first time in my life. I never even accidentally wet the bed even as young as 4 I never wet the bed but I was about to do it willingly now.  I only decided to do it because I only had to go a little so I only wet for half a minute. I thought I could head out for the day and it would be dry before I went to sleep but it was still damp when bedtime came around so that really sucked. I must have peed in bed more then I thought. So sense I had to sleep on my bedroom floor anyhow that night I was bursting to go so I crawled in bed and wet it really badly and masturbated afterwords sense I was not in a hurry this time.  It was one of the best moments of my life and nothing compares to it.       I am a virgin so I cannot say it would be as much fun as sex but I could get down with a guy if I wanted because I have boys asking me out all the time except I do not want any children before I am done university.  So judging my life story. lol   Why do I have this need?  I dont want to behave like a child when I wet and I dont want to buy diapers I just like the naughty feeling of doing something I should not do plus I have always had an attraction to pee type activities.  When I was younger I peed into a cup and tasted it so theres really nothing I have not done in that sense.  I guess I dont know whats going on?
20090219232343AAixdrQ	Social Science;Psychology	I've been feeling strangely...happy, lately?	Technically, this should be a very stressful time in my life. All my friends are stressed out, we have tests coming up soon, I have a plethora of projects and other activities I need to get done, and yet, I'm not stressed.   Just a couple weeks ago, I would begin freaking out over things, and now I'm very, almost creepily, calm.    Nothing really irks me as much as it used to, anymore. In fact, I'm starting to get a bit worried.   Lately, I've been looking at the big picture. So big, in fact, that everything else seems kind of obsolete. Tests, quizzes etc, seem just that, tests and quizzes.   I feel that my 'happiness' is somehow suppressing my work ethic. As I don't feel particularly time-pressed, I think I don't force myself to study as I should.   And before anyone mentions it, no, I'm not in love. Nor has anything of particular interest happened to me lately.   Is something missing? Shouldn't I be worried?

Its been 6 days. I know he's busy, he's in the process of moving to another state but he's done this in the past where he'll call for days straight and then stop calling all of a sudden.       Thoughts on this? Why go on a calling spree and then just stop? Especially for this long? Its driving me nuts.       I texted him last night, and he didnt respond.
20090220002423AAjwPXn	Social Science;Psychology	Are people who do evil always miserable inside?	Or in other words, would a person hurt another because they themselves are hurt?      I personally never want to hurt another. But the last few years a couple of times I became angry and depressed and I wanted to hurt someone somehow. Just had that thought/feeling. And I think in some ways I did. But I never felt any kind of happiness doing it. Revenge is different though. Not getting into that one now. But hurting other people to me was because I was upset and it never brought me pleasure. I was still miserable. But it happened very few times in my life.      Do you think that those who do bad to others, even if they smile while doing it, are actually miserable inside?

20090220000322AAnkQdq	Social Science;Psychology	How can I stop thinking excessively about everything related to her?	At my workplace there is a girl who works with me in my team. I proposed her 8-9 months back and she said NO. I am fine with this and we are still friends and we work together. We respect each other and we have nothing else in our minds except friendship. But after that, I have developed obsessive thinking about everything related with her. I analyze each and every single thing which happened between us like speaking, writing, working, walking etc. I am sick of thinking too much now. I am not expecting anything with her. And my over-analysing and excessive thinking is killing me. At the moment, every single person at my workplace likes me and I am friends with everyone and I sincerely mean EVERYONE. But I don't want to think excessively and obsessively about anything related to this girl anymore. Can you suggest me what can I do? Thanks. I need serious help to stop thinking. I am already going to a psychiatrist and my thinking has come down a lot than before but I want to improve more.

20090220001942AAR8gNO	Social Science;Psychology	Can a man with madonna whore complex be treated?	I've been dating a man for almost 4 months now and we still haven't had sex. At first he wanted to wait to get to know me better and I thought that was great but now he says he loves me and has somehow put me on a pedestal as the best woman who has ever come into his life and therefore can't have sex with me because it would degrade me. We kiss and he's very romantic and I have fallen in love with him but would like to move our relationship to physical one. He started seeing a sex therapist last week and I'm just wondering if this can be treated or am I putting hope into something that will never progress. If anyone out there has any answers or suggestions I would really appreciate it! Thank You.

En realidad no me dijo que se lo haga, sino que usara mi juguete en el. Un poco tengo ciertas ganas, pero otro poco me da cosa y me hace esto verme como una aprovechadora. Tal vez por el tema de que soy catolica y todo eso del pecado original. Ustedes que creen?      Alguno o alguna ya lo probo? O tuvieron fantasias al respecto? Yo se que es mas propio de las lesbis y yo no lo soy, pero si tengo un juguete que a veces le pido a mi novio que use conmigo. Tambien lei sobre el Punto G en los hombres y se dice que es una zona altamente erogena muy sensible. Asi que tambien me pregunto porque desaprovecharla si el no es gay? ?Tendria que hacerlo solo porque es una zona tabu en nuestra society? ?Porque no incursionar en su sexualidad y darme a mi misma el permiso para hacerlo?

This interests me!" It's not exactly a survival instinct - if anything, survival would be telling us, "Get out of there! Be afraid!"      I'm thinking both about genuine curiosity, like a kid poking a spider, and our hobbies, like what makes us enjoying studying what we do at university.      Thanks in advance!

20080927113335AA86Ext	Social Science;Psychology	How would you explain this persons behaviour in your opinion?	I value others perspectives. This man who is now 30 led a stereotypical "normal" life until he was 28. He worked full time, had a lovely partner and came from a well off family. He made the conscious decision that he wanted to experience the seedy side of life. He though the people that we usually pity or avoid led exciting and interesting lives of great variety. he packed his job and girlfriend off and started taking class a drugs, living with a  prostitute with one leg who was on heroin, fighting, getting arrested and shop lifting. He views it as a real life full of excitement and does not want to come back to the other side. so, from the age of 28 until now at 30 years old he has lived this life through choice. This baffles me, what do you think?

20090203120938AAr2CwM	Social Science;Psychology	How Can I Talk My Husband Into Marriage Counseling?	My husband and I have been married for 2 years and all of a sudden he wants to divorce. It came out of nowhere and he never talked to me about it before. He moved in with his dad and we separated. I tried to make things work, and he said he would too, but then he went back to saying he wanted to split. I still love him, even though he's put me through hell for the past three weeks. My head is telling me to just stop trying and try to move on, but my heart won't let him go; it's telling me to fight for him. I have loved him for almost 8 years now, and yes we're young, but when I told him I would marry him, I meant forever and he knew that. He asked me twice and he picked the date (which was sooner than I actually wanted, but I wanted him). He's hurt me so much, and I know that I should just stop and give in, but I just can't. Not until I've done everything that I can. I would like to try marriage counseling, just for a while, and if it doesn't help, I'll sign the papers. But I'm sure that he's not going to go for it. Not with his dad (who is on his 3rd or 4th wife and is a male chauvinistic pig in some cases) and other family members telling him how to handle it. I would like to just be able to sit in a neutral setting and at least try to work this out. I love him and I just don't know what to do. How can I talk him into going to a counselor? Really talk him into it?

He died hours later from internal bleeding and cardiac arrest...      Chris Calbi had been paying Linda $3,183 a month until her incarceration, and may be saddled with that amount when Linda is paroled.       The father now has to raise the surviving son, Dean, age 12, on his own. Is Linda being asked to pay child support? Isn't Chris' ability to provide for Dean negatively impacted by having to pay alimony to the noncustodial parent      I bet she request vistation rights when she gets out of jail.

20090220031859AA840St	Social Science;Psychology	Brain Sync, Kelly Howell, Brainwave Therapy and Subliminal Messages?	Hi there; I've recently downloaded a Kelly Howell's mp3 to improve my positive thinking. Its efficacy it's supposedly based on two points: brain waves of music that correct the electrical behavior of the brain and subliminal messages (positive messages spoken so low that only your subconscious mind can hear them) that are designed to improve your attitude.      So, people, what do you think about this? Have u ever tried it? U know something on this 'brainwave' subject?      I can personally get to accept that it may be good for my health, but... who the hack is Kelly Howell? Should I trust her to whisper subliminal messages to my brain? Maybe instead of positive thoughts she is uttering: 'Buy my whole set of products right now, baby!' XD Yep, it's hard for me to trust something I can't check... Is there any audio program that lets me analyze the subliminal messages in my purchase?      Thank u people.

20090220025302AAjdOWF	Social Science;Psychology	Can you just suggest me how to really enjoy my life?....plz read below.?	Hell, I'm in class 12 giving my board exams this march. First mistake i did in my life was i came home with a report card which said i am gud at studies. From then on i was expected better and better each time which i did. I forgot how it feels to taste icecream cones after school hours. I grew up with books, teachers and mentors. And now i'm in class 12.   People say i stand a very gud chance to get into the IITs but even if i reach there it will be expected of me to get a very gud campus selection or go on to get the best MBA college. And then i feel i will miss those class bunkings, flirting etc.   Even if i get a job i'll be asked to perform better and on and ?n.....help me eh.
20090220031943AA41dL1	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had two dreams which I'd like some help interpreting ...?	Ive been wanting to move to Canada desperately, and people told me to pray and ask God to tell me if moving to Canada will result in good things, and I had two dreams ...      One a few weeks ago, in which I was a at park babysitting my mother`s best friend`s children (who are also Canadian). After a while we started to go home (to MY house in the dream) and when we got there, out side the house, there was a large tree and my aunt and her daughters (Im very close to the two of them, they are like sisters) were sitting underneath it. I asked where my mother and my mums friend was, and they said up in the treehouse. I climbed up and my mums mum was also there, with my mum and her best friend. Then my dad came home and he got everyone down off the tree and took my grandmum to see the house. He asked her if she wanted to live with us and she said Definitely. Thats when the dream ended. What does this mean      the second dream I had just last night -- I dreamt my family (this time my mothers brother and his wife, as well as his four children: three boys and one infant girl, who is very close to me. also my parents) were all inside the house. my cousin from my dads side drank somethign which apparently was poison. She felt ill and the dream sort of told me that she was dying, but wouldnt ACTUALLY die. My baby cousin drank some but was extremely hyper and went out to play in the yard. Then, everyone told me to go get some groceries. I went out into our frontyard, and my cousin (the infant, lets call her Emma) was playing there. I waved to her and told her I was going to the shops but she wanted to come., The two of us went to the shops and on our way back, she felt ill, like my cousin. I got the same feeling: that she was dying but would pull through.      my mother has told me that these are good dreams, as seeing people die means they will have a long life or something like that. Um, help me interpret it please.
