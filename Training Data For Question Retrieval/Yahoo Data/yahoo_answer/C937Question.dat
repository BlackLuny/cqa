20090226160700AADh6nz	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I lost a lot of money in an online casino, what are my chances of getting my money back?	I started gambling at an online casino and won a very large sum and got it into my bank account. I continued playing but after some time I was hit by a losing streak I kept depositing with my Visa debit card and losing more and more funds until my card stopped working. At the end I had lost all the money I previously earned and on top of that my bank account was overdrawn by an amount I can't afford to pay back.      1.What are the chances of getting my money back by disputing the Visa charges and claiming they were unauthorised ?      2.If I don't succeed in reversing the transactions, am I being at the risk of being prosecuted by the bank due to the unpaid debt and be put in jail ? the overdrawn account is located at an offshore bank at a different continent.

20090226160628AAs1icJ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What are our chances of getting a home?	My boyfriend and I are currently renting an apartment, which has had a leaky roof since december. We let things go for a while, but after our second matress was destroyed when it started to leak again, we flipped. The apartment managers proceeded to inform us that we'd had complaints of teenagers running in an out all day (we both work 8-6, so this was impossible). Accused of destroying the lock on the front door (which we have a key for.. our car has already been broken into, why would we make it easier for someone to get into our apartment?), and told that when management had been in our apartment to inspect the broken light from the leak (after a month) our apartment was not up to cleanliness standards because there was clothing in the living room and a matress on the living room floor (clothing, because I'd had to get it out of my soaked bedroom, and we'd been sleeping on the floor for the same reason). So now, we've received a notice of eviction.      I tend to ramble, but my point being: I have bad credit. It's about a 481, mainly because of my stepfather when I was young (which I won't report because I refuse to get my mom in trouble), and a two credit cards (both with a balance now of about $500) that I was irresponsible with at 18. My boyfriend has a car payment that has never been late, but it's only about a year old. His credit is 587 according to one credit place, and 541 according to another. Combined, we make about $42,000 a year. We can scrape probably $2500 for a down payment if we absolutely need it.      Anyone know our odds of getting a house? And maybe where to start? We are trying to get pre-qualified, our bank said no, another guy recomended by my moms real estate agent friend is working on it also. We have a dog, it's hard to find apartments that allow them around here, we were lucky to find this one (up until december anyway). And we'd rather not rent again anyway.

20090226161307AAnyvr2	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Apartment is a safety hazard, what are my rights in Georgia?	Hi all,       I have a question about my rights as a renter. Last month the apartment that I am renting had 3 separate natural gas leaks, and last friday we awoke to a house full of smoke and a fire in the furnace due to faulty repairs to the above mentioned gas leaks.      We later found out that the person who did the repairs to the heating/air system was a plumber that the landlord contracted and had no experience with this type of work. After the fire someone who was certified came out to fix the problem and he stated that we could have been killed from the bad repair job.       I no longer feel safe for myself or my family here so my wife and I found a new apartment to live in yesterday and will be out this weekend.  When we told my landlord that we were moving he said he wanted next month's rent.      Do I have any rights as a tenant to refuse paying this due to these safety concerns?

20090226162639AA6rY1k	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Hired, then fired on same day?	My husband went through an employment agency for a job. He was set up an interview with a local company that specializes in his field of work. He was told at the end of the interview that his resume was impressive due to 25 years experience and that he had the job and could start next week. They also said he would be scheduled to take a drug screen tomorrow and would be in touch with him. He received a call from the owner (not the person that interviewed him) and was told that they would not be able to employ him because the employment agency required payment from them since he was hired. Then the employment agency called my husband and said that since he was under contract with them, he could not legally apply at the company on his own until 6 mos. from now. The employer has scheduled another person to interview tomorrow morning for the position that was supposed to be his. We know this because it happens to be a friend of ours that worked with my husband that had called them today inquiring on any open positions. Imagine our shock when we found out it was the same company he was interviewing with. My husband was told he could sue them for breech of contract but he never signed anything to start employment. He was only told verbally that he had gotten the job. He had not even done the drug screen yet. I was always under the impression that you aren't legally hired until after you fill out the tax forms. Personally, I think when the owner realized someone was coming in that was NOT through an agency that requires payment, he decided to back out of hiring my husband. You can't tell me this guy didn't KNOW he had to pay an agency if they hired one of their applicants.       Question 1: is there anything my husband can do legally?      Question 2: Now, I understand WHY the agency doesn't want him to go apply on his own but can they stop him legally?  Please advise!

Yea...yea I was stupid but I learned. So the names got changed on the title; I called the number and was told to find out the month/year when the title was changed and file a notice of liability release. What does that do? Will I get my refund if I provide all the proof? And how can I prevent it from hurting my credit?       It's been almost a whole year, I completely forgot when it was changed, I am not sure if I still even have the original copy. What can I do if I cannot find it? I asked the person if I will be refunded back and she was hesitant about giving me an yes or no answer.       I am really frustrated because I work so hard as a full-time student and employee. I am barely living life as it is with all the paper work and emotional distress that comes along with all these complications. I feel like I'm never going to have a break.

20090226191516AAwdauP	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	My boss has my coworker spying on me?	I believe my boss has my coworker spying on me.  They are good friends, my boss is always in my co-worker's office which is next to my office.  I had to change my work hours and come to work a half hour earlier than I normally did because of family reasons.  The first day I started my new schedule my coworker started coming in at the same time.  I'm not being paranoid because she doesn't even leave at the same time I do, she leaves at the normal time.  Then she gets to take 2 days off every other week or so to balance the hours because my job doesn't pay overtime.      I also think my boss is even having my coworker track my hours.  'Someone' told my boss that I left earlier than I actually did.  I can't even take a restroom break without someone having to know about it.  I have a condition that makes me use the restroom a lot, and guess what my boss said?  That if I'm having stomach issues to tell her when I'm going to the restroom. How crazy is that?  I have to walk past my coworker's office to go to the private restroom so she had to have told.      I don't know if there is more than one coworker spying on me, but I have a good feeling it is just that one person.  My boss is constantly in her office gossiping about who knows what.  Of course, they can hang out, talk, and get away with it, but I can't even go to the damn restroom.  My best friend works there too but her office is on the other side of the building.  I guess they assume I'm there but all they have to do is walk past her office and see that I'm not.        What should I do about this situation?  I don't want to keep running away from jobs because of crazy coworkers because there are annoying coworkers everywhere.  I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with it.

20090225120653AAuYZlC	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Long Interviews Wait Times?	I have a slight issue with a few companies that I've put in applications with.        The first one is a company called Convergys.  Not sure if any of you have heard of them but here's what they do.  I put my resume in with them some time ago and about a month ago they call me for a phone interview.  I did well enough to be told that they were gonna go ahead and schedule me for the next step which is an in person interview.  Again, that was a month ago.  4 weeks later the guy finally calls me saying he's ready to set something up.  But before he does that he says, "opps, let me put you on hold for a minute to check something."  2 minutes later he comes back saying he'd have to get back with me because the scheduled times were like at 12 AM.  I asked him why such a long time in waiting to see someone?  I then ask him is it gonna be another week before I hear from me again and he tells me he's in Chicago and he doesn't know much about when the local office would be needing people.  I'm in NC.      Next thing is this.  Apparently I put in an application back in August of 2007 and a few weeks ago I get a call from company with a voice recording saying they had been reviewing resumes and applications that they had received in the past week.  Thinking to myself I hadn't put in any resumes or apps in the past week I held on to speak to someone.  When the girl finally came on the phone she told me they were a 3rd party company doing the interviewing process for another company to schedule interviews and that I had applied with this company in '07.  I asked who the company was and she told me she didn't have that information.  I was like, "you work for a company who schedules appointments for people but you have no idea who you are working for."  She said, "that's correct"  The next thing she said was that she would submit my information and if they liked me they'd arrange a meeting.  2 weeks later I've heard nothing from them.  I guess they didn't like me.  I was sort of snippy when the girl couldn't tell me who she worked for or who they were setting up appointments for.      Has anyone else ever experience this type of behavior while looking for a job?

Now, in 2008, the sewer company is calling her and telling her she owes them $2,000, because she didn't call them and tell them she switched to public water, so they're charging her for years worth of sewer bills.

Please do NOT say medicine, I've been considering this career for years and am very serious about going into it, but I'd just like to know if there's any other career where you help people and make good money. By a good living I mean 6 figures (like 500,000+). Please don't judge me, my parents both worked really hard to give me the life they did and I would like to be abel to continue the life that I have while suppourting myself. I'm really passionate about helping others and that's what I'd love to do. I'm putting this under Law because people have told me I'd make a lawyer. I've never considered Law school or anything in the proffession. My parents went through a nasty divorce that was a battle fought through lawyers and I could never see myself being a lawyer after it. I know not all lawyers are divorce attorneys, which is why I'm asking the question. Are there any types of lawyers that really help people (prefferably children) and make good money.

20090226190912AAFib7U	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Another nursing career question...cna certificate?	I've been hearing some negative comments from people working as cna's, but I feel like this might be something I wouldn't mind doing for awhile - despite pay (And it would be better than nothing, especially in this economy where there are hardly any jobs available).       I hate to say that I don't have the best focus - but thats the truth. Accomplishing this would make me feel good and driven. It would be a motivation factor while pursuing the nursing career step by step - even if having the certificate isn't all that grand.      With that said would it be a wise idea to :      1.Take the cna course in my community college and obtain the certificate.   2.Work as a cna part-time (if that's a possibility)   3.Get my associates in nursing at community college   4.Followed by bachelors in nursing at university   5.Which could then possibly (and hopefully) result in a dream of going to third world countries on church missionaries and offering some of medical services...      ?      I've also heard that a cna certificate has to be renewed...does that mean you'd have to take the program over again?
20090225120553AAzS7YR	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What should I do about my husbands boss who is constantly late with his pay checks?	it has been over a year since this situation has be brought into out lives.  We know that his boss is good for the money, it just takes a month or so (each time) for him to pay us.  I'm tired of living out of our savings (and having to stress out about being paid on time).  His boss has also been late on payments to the insurance (by law the insurance company has to contact us if he is over 30 days late and this has happened 3 times in the last 6 months) but luckily we still have insurance.  My husband HAS been looking for other work for the last 6 months, but hasn't been able to find anything (due to the fact that he is exhausted from work by the time he gets home and his work responsibilities often run into the weekends - something that makes me even angrier because he is on salary).  This financial stress is also putting a stress on our marital relationship.  It's not that I think my husband is an idiot (which he accuses me of thinking), I just become a little obsessed when the pay check is over 15 days late (and so I remind my husband to ask his boss when we will get paid).  I guess I should be grateful that he has a job but when he's working (and working) and not getting paid (at least not on time), I get mad that his boss is taking advantage of him (although his boss is this way with everyone).  Advice is appreciated.

20090226183548AAlxPJ4	Business & Finance;Small Business	I am starting a Video Production Service in Western Kansas. Can anyone give me tips?	I am a Media Studies-Video Production Student who graduates in December looking for any advice that I can get to start my own video production company. I did not find any internships at production companies in my area. So I decided to open my own business. I have bought a cheaper used DV camera to use only for a little while until I make enough money to buy HD. I have set aside 3K for start-up. This will allow me to buy basic equipment. While I only have a little bit of equipment thus far, I have loads of passion for the work, confidence in my success, and support from my peers. The good news: I established a shoot with my my first client in April. I am looking for tips on shooting at weddings. My advisor at school said it would be a good idea to shadow a fellow company that is shooting a wedding in a non-competing location to get a feel for the format. I agree. Does anyone have any tips or contacts in Colorado, Kansas, or Nebraska that I could shadow? Thanks. I look forward to your advice.

Ok so I am insured under my dads employer by kaiser, but I moved out of my house and live with my fiance, I am still under my dads insurance though because I am a student.

Medi-cal only covers my pregnancy though so I have both kaiser and medi-cal. Nothing was ever said about it but now medi-cal has sent a letter to my doctor saying that I cannot be insured underr both. Is this right? Does this mean that my dad has to drop me from kaiser? Is there a way I can keep kaiser but use medi-cal for my pregnancy related stuff?

20090226181724AAxQZKl	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	During the winter of 1973-74, a general system of wage and price controls (including a price ceiling on gasoli?	During the winter of 1973-74, a general system of wage and price controls (including a price ceiling on gasoline) was in force in the United States. At the beginning of 1974, some oil-producing countries imposed an oil embargo on the West. In the spring of 1974, price controls were abolished.   16.    Refer to Situation 3-1. Before the oil embargo, the price ceiling on gasoline had no noticeable effect on the market. What is the most likely explanation for this?       A. The equilibrium price of gasoline was close to the ceiling price and probably below it.   B. Twenty years ago, the demand curve for gasoline was quite different from today's.   C. Twenty years ago, the supply curve for gasoline was quite different from today's.   D. The effects of price ceilings are dependent upon the benevolence of the government imposing them.   17.    Refer to Situation 3-1. An economist would predict that the oil embargo imposed in 1974 would result in a       A. leftward shift in the supply (curve) of gasoline.   B. rightward shift in the supply (curve) of gasoline.   C. leftward shift in the demand (curve) for gasoline.   D. rightward shift in the demand (curve) for gasoline.   E. both a and d   18.    Refer to Situation 3-1. If no price controls had been in place, the effect of the oil embargo on the equilibrium price and quantity of gasoline would have been       A. an increase in both price and quantity.   B. an increase in price and a decrease in quantity.   C. a decrease in price and an increase in quantity.   D. a decrease in both price and quantity.   19.    Refer to Situation 3-1. Because price controls were in effect at the time the embargo occurred, an economist would predict that       A. the amount of dollars one would need to pay at the pump for a full tank of gasoline would increase sharply.   B. the amount of dollars one would need to pay at the pump for a full tank of gasoline would decline sharply.   C. long waiting lines and black markets would appear.   D. a surplus of gasoline would result.   20.    Refer to Situation 3-1. An economist would predict that once price controls were abolished in the spring of 1974,       A. the price of gasoline would decline sharply.   B. the surplus of gasoline would vanish.   C. the shortage of gasoline would vanish.   D. the demand for gasoline would decrease.   E. both c and d

20090226172405AAsrkg8	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Any advice on what to do about this guy at work?	He isn't my boss but is always yelling at me for not doing my job when I'm sitting at the front desk busting my @ss. Today I got angry with him because he transferred a client to my phone. This client had questions about a bid this guy was supposed to put together for him. I knew nothing about it so I couldn't answer the client's questions. When I went to his desk to get some answers he was sitting there jabbering with a friend in Spanish on his personal cell. I don't speak it but understood enough to know he planned on having someone else clock him out at his scheduled departure time so he could leave early. About 2 yrs ago my employer replaced the card punch time clock with an electronic one because of this was a constant problem. While I was standing there waiting this guy gave his timeclock code to this other guy who happens to be mentally handicapped and tells him its the new gate code. I also double as the IT person so I knew better. The code he wrote down is also the passcode for his computer (employer prefers these codes to be the same). According to company policy, having someone else clock you out is grounds for immediate termination for both parties. I'm really pissed at him for leaving me hanging with that client call AND having someone else punch him out so he could leave early. I want to report him for violating policy but he has a new baby at home. In this economy I would feel bad if he was fired for it and couldn't afford to feed his family because he couldn't land another job. Should he be reported anyway?

20090226180755AAmFTEP	Business & Finance;Insurance	How can I protect myself from liability?	I am soon to start teaching a small group of children (6-7) Chinese Wushu (a performance variant of Chinese martial arts).  I have plenty of teaching experience, however this is my first time teaching outside of an established school.  It's a fairly casual affair, but I would still like to protect myself from any liability suits by having each parent sign a standard waiver.  I've found many waiver forms online that I figure I can adjust the wording to, but how effective are these?  What is the best way to protect myself without going through the costly and time-consuming process of having a lawyer put together a waiver/contract?  I'm certainly not going to have these kids doing anything dangerous, but there is inherent risk in any physical activity...and I know that many people are still sue-happy.
