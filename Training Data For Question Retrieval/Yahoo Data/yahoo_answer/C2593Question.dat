20090307210436AAVCrMy	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is the reason my engine is smoking and how canit be fixed?	I have a 1995 Ford Probe and it has bad valve stem seals. They would only leak causing smoke after sitting over a cold night, but when its warm they were fine and didn't leak. Well I changed my oil the other day and I used the same motorcraft 10w-30 synthetic I have always used, but this time I substituted 20% with Lucas oil stabilizer. I made the mistake of putting the Lucas in first. Afterwards I found out i should have put the oil in first and lt it warm up then put the Lucas in and drive it for a minute to let it mix good. Well since I did that now the car has a rough idle and smokes upon start up when its been sitting over night even though its not cold anymore where I live. I also occationally hear a ticking noise now when reving it up and i didn't hear it before. What can be the problem and how can I fix it. I am considering using sea foam to decarbon the engine because the compression is higher than it should be, should I use Lucas engine stop leak when I change the oil instead of oil stabilizer.

Hello I am a young female that knows very little about cars but i knw when somehing is wrong. I usually consult my boyfriend about these matters but he is currently incarcerated. But yesterday and today when I tried to crank my car it didnt crank but it DOES crank when i press the gas a crank it and it makes a big REVROOM noise and goes fine. It was not doing this when I first left the house but when I make about 3 or 4 stops it starts at like the 3rd or so. Yesterday once i got it going i thought it was fine but i planned on shopping at about 6 or 7 places today and it started messing up at like the 3rd stop so I went home once i got it Reved up and going. One of my mechanic friends said that my fuel pump may be going bad and that this happens when there is frequently little gas that cools the pump. I feel that this may be the problem because I often ride until i am on the light until i get gas not knowing that it was bad to do that. I just need someone to tell me if this like the issue or not?? Also how long can i keep going my just doing that big REVROOM and reving it up; is that going to mess something else up??? Btw it is a 95 ford explorer (old i know) and about HOW MUCH will this cost?? And last i was told it GOING BAD so is there a difference in the repair from if is TOTALLY BROKE or GOING BAD???

It passed a mechanical repair shops inspection with a clean bill of health, but when I first took it driving when it was raining I had a problem with the wipers.  At first they were fine and then they started lightly hitting eachother about once every few minutes.  Finally, they hit enough where they got entangled and I had to pull over.  When I brought it into the mechanics before I ultimately decided to buy this used mini van, they did say that one of the windshield wiper arms was slightly bent, but I didn't think that was a big deal because the windshield wipers still seemed to work fine and, in the grand scheme of buying a used vehicle, that seemed like a minor repair to have to make down the road... Now I am just wondering what to expect as far as what needs repair on the vehicle... Could the windshield wipers be off and made to hit eachother because of the slight bend in the arm and just need bending back or what are the other possibilities as far as the cause of the off timing in the rhythm of the wipers?  Also, if you have any possible diagnosis, please let me know an approximate amount of money the parts plus the labor on this fix will be...Thanks so much in advance!

20090307214856AABqnUf	Cars & Transportation;Safety	What do you think causes accidents? Speed doesn't kill?	Do you think more accidents are caused by drivers not paying attention, talking on the cell phone, failed to yield right of way, weaving in and out of traffic, excessive speeding on a 2 lane road or residential streets, drunk driving or on drugs or medication, prior health conditions, driving too fast for conditions (rain, snow, fog, traffic), or are people just bad drivers? In my opinion, speed always gets a bad rap as causing accidents when it's more likely the driver was distracted. What do you think?

However I have a 351W that was casted in 1988. I have headers and have header mount mufflers that extend 3" past the cab.       The problem is that the inspector refuses to pass the vehicle because it has no cat converters. By law I have to go to that inspector to get it passed, because he didn't pass it the first time.       I was under the impression that if the vehicle was made before the emissions law went into effect, your vehicle was not required to have cat converters. I've asked the DMV, and was told that I don't need cat converters, even if the engine is a '88, because the oem engine didn't require cat converters.      Yet, the inspector won't pass it. What do I do?

Do my parents know what high schoolers will think when i pull up in the parking lot in that piece of crap. they told me to look up cars and prices and milleage. all the ones i found had like 90,000 miles on them and were for like 6000. so what do they do? buy me a stupid little hybrid that has 113,000 miles on it and has a broken cd player for the same amount of money. I have had it up to here i honestly want to hire a hitman.

We had four people trying to remove the headrests in order to fit a child seat and none of us could manage it.  Is it some sort of misguided safety feature or are we just a bit thick for not managing it?      The manual was no help, before anyone tells me to look at that.
20090227120143AAkyrKl	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Waiting time for motorcycle license?	Ok i live in Pa and im about to get my motorcycle permit. Now i read the operators guide and it says that if you take the 15 hour beginner's safety program and successfully complete it your permit is immediately upgraded to a license.

20070430174831AAB6Rro	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car won't start sometimes.?	My car won't start sometimes but when it starts it's just fine while driving. When I turn the key the battery seems ok because everything turns on well, like the radio, headlights, and interior lights. When I turn the key to the right to start the engine, I hear the subtle sound like 'wooooz' perhaps some sound of the electricity(sounds normal) instead of the engine firing up. I'd wait for a while, then it starts fine. When it doen't start, I tried holding the key position at the very end for a while. It starts sometimes this way. This problem becan to occur after installing the Daytime Running Lamps requirement in Canada. It was required to set my car to automatically start the headlight with the start of the car. I did the installation thru Canadian Tire. Their technician say the battery is fine and rules out the possibility caused by the installation. If the installation is not the problem, what would you say the factor is? (new spark plugs, Hyundai Elantra 2005)

Salve a tutti, vivo nella citta' con maggior densita' di scooter 50cc e altri (LIVORNO) ed essendo un adolescente noto soprattutto che molti "elaborano" i propri scooter con marmitte di ogni genere...dalla sp3 alla 4road...sinceramente non ho mai avuto la tentazione di mettervene una sopra il mio sr sport 50cc dato che sapevo che non erano omologate e quindi nel caso mi fermassero, erano guai...solamente che proprio adesso "spulciando" qualche sito di marmitte (vedi leovince etc...) ho visto in una scheda tecnica di una marmitta ( LEOVINCE TT PER SR50) che vi e' scritto che e' omologata...come e' possibile??? rispondete in tanti tanti!
