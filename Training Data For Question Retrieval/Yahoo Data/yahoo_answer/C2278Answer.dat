(BY THE WAY: all this is free)   for internet go and click internet then u have to have wireless internet in/near ur house and then go to Scan>manually>(the internet connection discription has to be "none")click on the connection and there yah go    (**note** the internet connection has to be 60% or more to work properly!**)|`|OFPaqKDvaa	You need to have a CFW, or custom firmware, which basically means, you need to hack your psp.  IF you really want to do it, google search or youtube search "PSP CFW 4.01 M33".  That way you can also get more customized backgrounds, download movies and even download games without needing the game umd.|`|pFsqFeDCaa	LIMEWIRE|`|rZpJoHuXaa	first of all you need a dvd rip put in the dvd rip then convert the file to a psp format. fix the mega pxiels on the video for sharpness use a audio sync so it comies on sync. and go on the internet ? are you serious u dont no how!?!?! use a access point...(aka wireless interent a router)... wow... you are so dumb with technology... what are you lke 11?|`|NX7HZmNYaa	You have to set up your wireless browser, and you need to convert your video files and put them on the card.|`|q9yQwOecaa	Make sure your videos are in a format the PSP can recognize. Plug it into your CPU, go to "my computer", and open up the PSP device. If there is no file for videos there already, make one yourself. Create a new folder called "VIDEO" It has to be in all capitals. Then just drag and drop/copy and paste MP4, MPEG, etc. into the folder.     To use the internet navigate to the home menu of the PSP. (the one with music, vids, pics, etc.) There is an internet browser option all the way to the right. You need to have a wireless signal in the air in order to browse. It may say to turn on some switch, this switch is on the PSP (on the left side for black PSPs, up is on). I dont know where it is on white PSPs.|`|wRgg1mEKaa	Ok so number 1 u don't need a haxed psp.

M4L3QY3gaa	Ignore people asking you what game it's for. You do find Gible in Wayward Cave, in BOTH games.     But there is a second entrance that is hidden under the cycling road that you must find. It will lead you to an area where there are Gible aplenty!    Alright, first you go where you normally would to the entrance to Wayward Cave. Then, you've got to 'feel' around the mountainside hidden by cycling road, you should eventually enter the hidden area. Have fun with your new Gible!    Click on the second link, and where the fragmented blue line is, is where you should go in order to access the hidden cave.     The first link shows you a complete layout of both cave parts.|`|NVaNSxTVaa	what game is this say what game it is|`|3aTM6pawaa	You can use gameshark for diamond in Gamefaqs...|`|UjG8hBAMaa	I haven't played pearl in about a year but i don't think gible is in  diamond so trade or use a cheatcode

WXi033Kxaa	It's an amazing system for being portable! It's similar to the PS2 graphics I think..in my opinion. You can watch a few videos on Youtube if you're curious. I would suggest buying a cheap or used memory card to get started with anything if you decide to get the system. The sound is great.     I love my PSP. It's like a mini computer.|`|KWypsVPDaa	PSP is a hand-held system from Sony. They have good graphics but are a little expensive and easily take minor damages (such as control sticks falling off) I am quite sure that there is only one kind although there are different colors. They are not to be compared with systems like the Wii PS2 or X-Box 360 which are not hand held systems but i personally prefer my DS.|`|PtGXzyYuaa	the only thing better is the 360, unless you want some games where its interactive you should get the wii, and the ps2 is junk now. the psp has an internet browser on it and the games are cheaper. the downside ,however, is that the games are a little repetitive due to the 1 analog stick. i have a 360 and psp and i have played a ps3 and wii. i prefer the xbox but for online play, you have to pay per month, 3 months or a year.|`|lute9nGtaa	If your son likes party, puzzle and fun interactive games then get him a DS. If he likes bashing, crashing and a bit more skillful games then get him a PSP. I'd rather get a hand held console since there so popular these days, because you can take them anywhere!  Ds has more battery life than PSP. PSP can download games with custom firmware and memory stick. DS doesn't need memery stick.  Get the PSP thats big the other ones break easily. The DS Lite if you want the DS. DS also has R4 which is a download game thing whoch you can dowload games on to memory stick.  Have Fun with the new consoles. :)|`|N78T2oR4aa	look,I'm not a tech girl and i only have a psp for the music but i know one thing:  don't get him the newer ones , because they break really , really ,really easily (and i am not exaggerating) and cause they r older , they r less expensive

k13V3Xj8aa	Think it as designing a character in a play or a movie.    What does it like?  Maybe it loves cats?    What does it hate?  Maybe it hates dogs?    What does it dream of doing?  It might want to     What are it's goals?  Maybe it wants to travel someplace?    What are it's faults or weaknesses?  Like maybe it is obsessed with chocolate or hates gnomes?    Where is it from?  Does it want to go home?  Does it like telling you about an imaginary place that it's from?    Making it real is knowing "who" it is and what it wants, needs, has, or even shouldn't get.    How does it talk?  Is it a high pitch voice?  Does it sound British or French?      Even picture how it moves... Does it bounce or walk or zip around.      Some people writing stories write pages and pages of "back story" on each of their characters, then knowing that characters history and personality they know what they WILL do and HOW they will respond. With that effort it almost becomes easy.|`|jM3BSbYyaa	Believe!      haha how corny.|`|O8ZtdBIIaa	Talk to them, imagine that they're talking back to you and play with it and treat it like you would to a human being

eNHGiEvGaa	You will not face any risk of arrest or prosecution.  The only people taking a legal risk are the companies that process the money cashout/transfer.      Your risks are mainly financial:      A) there's the risk of losing the bet     B) there's the risk that something could prevent you getting paid (but this is unlikely).  Bodog will definitely pay.  There have been times in the past when, in the face of new legislation, a company such as Neteller has had its funds frozen, and players had to wait many months to finally get paid.  But I've heard of no such problems lately.    C) there's the question of whether to report your winnings on your taxes.  Any time you make a transfer in excess of $10,000 U.S. Dollars, you can attract attention.  Smaller withdrawals are generally not seen.  But in technical law you can be prosecuted for concealing financial activity by dividing your transfer into smaller amounts.  This would be a very unlikely legal case, unless you were targeted for other reasons as a money launderer/drug smuggler/terrorist.|`|u2slnVCoaa	Its not illegal at all. However there are better choices than bodog like the listed in http://www.bettingwise.com/usagamblingsi...|`|BwyRLFrhaa	If you use bodoglife.com they won't let you plunk down $10K because they are a rec book.  Even if they take your bet it will be like pulling teeth to get them to payout without the check bouncing!  I've received numerous reports of just that happening over the last year with them.  If you use a reputable site then you won't have any problems.  If you win, just take your payouts in increments of 5K or less and they won't be flagged.  Of course, you are required to pay income tax on any profit, but you can deduct losses against that number.  If  you are looking for a reliable site, then check out the recommended sites at http://GamblingReviewsSite.com  They offer truly independent reviews that are certified by the GPWA.  You won't have any problems getting paid quickly by any of those sites.  Also check out the free sports picks and message board for some good chat and picks!  Good luck!
PwZZJh1taa	next time your near a large bookstore like walden or barnes noble go to the collectibles section and there you'll find refrence books matchbox cars comic books dolls etc there is also a book on avon collectibles i'm quite sure 100% positive. you can also listit on ebay and set a high reserve and you can see what the market will "bear" obviously it wont sell due to the high reserve, but you will know what the highest someone was willing to go for it. should you decisde to sell list it just a bit higher and wait. i like auctions because guides tell you a price, while an auction will tell you what it is worth now realisticly. remember it is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. if it is a family heirloom i'd keep it unless you need money.

bkMb4Ppcaa	It will arrive in a long thin box, likely around 3 1/2 to 4 feet long and just wide enough for the sword to fit.  As for a signature... short answer: no.  Long answer:  They will likely use UPS, but it depends on the service they used to ship whether a signature is required.  It costs more for the company to require a signature, and MOST residential deliveries do not require one unless you chose express shipping.  If you live in an apartment, one will likely be required by someone at that apartment, a landlord or front desk.  If you live in a bad neighborhood or UPS has had many thefts, they will likely require a signature from someone as well.  If no one is available to sign (it does not have to be you), they will leave a note telling you where and when to pick it up.

Those where the absolute basic equipment for most jewellery projects and you can get very fancy when setting up. I tend towards the woven pieces (think native American beadwork) which also requires good quality beading needles and non decay thread.  heres a website which sells all the equipment you could possibly want as well as providing the most comprehensive tutorials and instructions anywhere I've seen  http://www.firemountaingems.com/    Actually, I'm suprised someone hasn't already given it nearly every question on this topic somebody will supply it in an answer|`|zYAQrnjcaa	It's pretty easy for me. I've sold a bunch of jewelry I made on Ebay. I guess it depends on the person though because some people don't have the patience for it, especially with seed beads. I usually just buy all sorts of beads from craft stores or even walmart. I'm not really sure of any kits though.|`|29dVhqXUaa	There are a bunch of fancy things that are involved in making jewelry, but it is really quite simple.  You will NEED:    1. A pair of jewelry pliers.  You will need these for crimp beads, bending wire, and much more.  They look like ordinary pliers, but the ends are small and perfect for grasping little things.    2. Crimping beads.  These are used in all jewelry.  What you do is once you are finished with a necklace, you put a crimping bead on the end,  take your clasp and string it onto the wire, and tuck the extra wire into the crimp bead.  You then take the pliers and grasp the bead with them, then squeeze really hard and it will squish down and hold you clasp.     3.  Beading wire.  this in really the only thing you can use for jewelry as it is pliable and durable.    Bead stores carry a variety of beads and would be happy to help you out,  you can also probably take a class or just watch some videos online.  Be warned, beads are VERY expensive.  Good Luck and have fun!|`|ad89O2nCaa	I make alot of jewelry and i find it easy to do but you need allot of patient to make jewelry also i depends what you plan on making if you plan on using wire that brakes easily if push to hard.Also if you use hemp string make sure the hole in the bead is big enough to go on the string.

Don't waste your master ball on it. Buy loads of ultra balls. My brother got it with a poke ball. If you're short of cash, go to the route south of hearthome city (where the pokemon mansion is) and the people there give out loads of money when you beat them. Use the vs. seeker to battle them many times, and use the amulet coin (if you have one) to get double prize money. You may also need some hyper potions if you're pokemon are weak. Dialga is very strong.    PS. The blackout doesn't mean anything. It's just an excuse to stop you passing. You dont do anything to get it fixed. Once you have caught Dialga, the road is clear.|`|AlK42wXDaa	You have to catch or defeat(you can still catch it afterwards) Dialga or Palkia Depending on which version you have.

Integrated graphics are not recommended for the Sims 2 games. <br>  The flashing red and purple walls are not 'stupid' errors, they are caused by the fact that you are playing the game with unsupported hardware, and probably on a laptop.<br>  If you cannot play Pets or Seasons there is no way you'll be able to play Bon Voyage, which has even higher graphics requirements.

bx7qmKbGaa	It took me forEVER to get this right. I couldn't figure it out for the life of me! Here is my little guide on what to do:    *First, get the foal to a walk. Jerk the controller and nunchuck to the left. If the foal shakes his head, try giving it a carrot(which you pick in the garden) using B.     *Once you get it moving, look at the radar at the top of the screen. It shows you when the next block will show up. It can be at three possible distances, and you might not be on the right line. To move the foal farther out, throw the controller and nunchuck down and away from you. Do the oppisite to bring it closer.     *Once you are near the checkpoint, slow the foal down to a walk by jerking to the right. When you are very close, Jerk to the right again to stop him.    *Do it again 9 times.     ****TIPS*******  *Make sure you are stocked up on carrots before you start.    *It takes a LOT of practice to get it down, so don't feel bad. :)    *Try riding in races too to earn some extra money until you get it down.    *Once you have enough money to build the therapy center, you can earn money that way.      Good luck! Hope I helped you!

VkXv4RInaa	try updating the driver for your GFX card. AoE2 should work with XP without having to set any compatibility issues, so dont worry about that.
zfiBHtbVaa	Hmm, since you did not specify what game console or system you are using, this will be difficult.    The Warcraft games for the PC are very good, Warcraft III is one of the best strategy rpgs on the market.  Also for the PC there is Baldur's Gate, I recommend the Shadows of Amn one.  Microsoft's Dungeon Siege is good if your looking for a straight forward RPG game with allies and boss fights. Has a good story line too.  There is also Morrowind and Diablo, all installations are good.      For playstation there are a huge selection you can choose any of the Final Fantasy games (I suggest 7 or 10) There are also the .hack sign games which are very good and i recommend them. You can also try Disgaea: Hour of Darkness for the playstation 2.    For Nintendo, there are few Final Fantasy Games for the DS. There is also the Golden Sun series for the gameboy which i HIGHLY Recommend if you have a gameboy or DS.    Most of these games are 4-6 years old, so their prices now are cheap.|`|1472ff1512afec30a1ddbab9ff3dfd5faa	runescape? i like it its fun and its free online no download if you do play it add me user garidorn and email me if you decied to to it email bmxrider1997@yahoo.com|`|xq6dnRuhaa	It would be good to know what console(s) you have or if you want it for PC only. Also, I will take into account that you are a girl and you want a good cheap rpg, so I'll disregard expensive stuff or very crappy stuff.    For ps2 I would recommend Xenosaga episode 1 because that one can be bought from amazon for less than $10 total (you will need a credit card to buy it or just someone who buys it for you) and the protagonist is a young woman so you will probably like that. Plus not just that of course the story is good and cinematic, it is a good rpg.    For PC, I recommend Septerra Core Legacy of the Creator. It is old and it is a good PC rpg. It can be bought from amazon from here:    http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_vg?url...    and the LOWEST priced one ($1.74, total should be no more than $5.90) is good enough. That is the one I have and that can be installed and works on Vista, even if it says windows 95/98/ME only (that's the one I have and works on Vista so... that one is good enough)  Also, guess what, the protagonist is a woman again. This one doesn't have the wow graphics but it is interesting and has a great cast of characters. I recommend it only if you are patient though because getting stuck in this game was something common..... just check a faq from gamefaqs and that won't be a problem, also updating this game with its lastest patch is a must. Overall it is good, and cheap, and not too intense either; but well not the best rpg I have played either, but since the main character is a woman and it fits what you want I am recommending it, and no it ain't bad at all but it is not a wow either. I would give it an 8.2/10    Last, would be Snes rpgs, such as Final Fantasy 6 (aka Final Fantasy 3), Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, and Seiken Densetsu 3. Probably the one that fits what you want better is SM RPG, it is not intense but it is good for sure, and ALL these are very good anyways. Use the emulator Zsnes to play them. Download its last version from zsnes.com   Then go here for the games:  http://oneflyride.wordpress.com/2007/06/...

bC2EgShAaa	If you're thinking of BUYING GOLD, Invest in Brain Kopp's 1-70 guide. It's actually really good.|`|do7i1Inuaa	Addons my friend. Get Carbonate or Questhelper to levelup; they are really helpful. Also, don't do instances. You should only do instances if you have like 5 quests there. It takes to long to find a group and run themwhich usally takes an hout with lowbies. To get money, you should have gathering professions (herbialism,mining,skinning). Look at your local AH to see what is in demand. I personally have found out that herb and mining are the best. People love there ore and pot...i mean potions.     Work on your professions first since your are a Death Knight. Get them up in a weekend or something then when you are in Outland you dont have to wastetime traveling back to pre-BC locations.     Once your profs are high you should level your profs and yourself at abou the same time.     I have found out that enchanting is decent at making money. Plus,with the resent Motorcycle mount that a really rare item to havemade for you. So engineering is an idea.     Oh, and don't have the same professions on different alts. Get a foothold in all professions so if one market goes bad you can always go to a new one if needed for money.     SOOOOO.... a little recap. As a DK you will not be able to lvl both fields at the same time. Get your money making up then level. While lvling dont do instance and get addons like Carbonate and Questhelper.     Good luck! FOR THE HORDE!|`|Ta8UiKVwaa	Do not buy gold, it is a waste of money...  To get to Northrend you only need to be 68 and when you are there you can earn over 1k in the first few levels.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  1. Rome: Total War was set in a time frame from 270 BC - 14 AD (284 years). Each turn was 6 months, so you had 568 turns in total. However, this was ridiculous and didn't provide a challenge to any player. Consequently, a reform was made in the next title.<br>  <br>  2. Medieval II: Total War didn't have 800 turns. It started in 1080 AD and ended in 1530 AD (450 years). But each turn was 2 years on this occassion. That makes a much more interesting and detailed 225 turns. <br>  <br>  3. Empire: Total War is similar, as it begins at the start of the 1700s, and concludes at the start of the 19th century (100-120 years). Each turn is now back to 6 months, so this will roughly make 200-240 turns.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  There's no need to worry, Empire: Total War will be the perfect length, but it will also contain far better gameplay in physics, dynamics and options.|`|U98rlS8qaa	What a pointless question! Who cares, just play the game lots of different times with different factions!
pYj8KZUNaa	If the DSi is using a different Card etc. for games than the DS lite will drop in price because Nintendo will want to sell off the last of the stock and focus on the DSi but if the card stays the same then the price drop will be minimal or non-existant.<br>  <br>  in that case, you will have to wait for maybe one quarter of the financial year for the price to drop.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|t0GFbGGxaa	no because the dsi price is more expensive so it will make the ds lite look cheap.  So i think the ds lite is staying the same|`|7v1pBZWwaa	yes i would wait because once the dsi come's out the price of the ds lite should drop it wont be alot at first but give it time and it will|`|pLnKK6KJaa	I think the DS lite will drop because it will be older|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No because the DSi is 169.99 while the DS Lite is 129.99.  Once the DSi drops to 129.99, then the Lite will get a price drop.
eNHGiEvGaa	Here's the basics:    The player rolls two dice.  If he hits a total of 7 or 11, it's an instant win.  If he rolls 2, 3, or 12 it's an instant loss (crapped out).  Any other total is his "point."    If the player rolled a point on his first roll, then he must continue to roll the dice until he hits his point again (winner!), or rolls a 7 (loser!)    Example:  I roll 33 for a total of 6.  Roll again.  I roll 54 for a total of 9.  Means nothing, roll again.  I roll a total of 10.  Try again.  I roll a 24 for a total of 6.  Yeah, I hit my point!  Winner!    There can be various ways to bet.  In a private game, one player might put up a bank of money and other players can have turns to "fade" as much of that bank as they like, by betting against the roller.  He either wins and collects from all, or loses and pays all.  Or, in a casino, players may choose to bet either with or against the roller, with the house covering all action either way.  In such a case, they typically rule that one of the "crap out" rolls, such as a 2, does not pay the bettors who bet against the roller.    There are plenty of other ways to bet.  You can treat any roll in the sequence as if it was a new come out roll, betting that the player from that point forward will either "win" or "lose".  Check wikipedia for more ways to bet.|`|oK2sp9W7aa	After you learn the basics, there are approximately 40 bets than can be made at a craps table.  This can be a little daunting but once you realize how the game goes, it is fairly easy to keep up with.      There are a few bets that you should never make because the house edge is skewed in their advantage. There are some though with as little as 1.3% house edge which is better than most other casino games.    Here are 10 basic categories the bets fall into:    Pass Line  Free Odds Bet  Don't Pass Line:  Field Bet  Come Bet  Don't Come Bet  Place Bets  Buy Bet  Proposition Bets  Hard Ways    There is an explanation at each in the source site below.
BMpcXxrOaa	Me too! I'm only 14 and i'm 4'11 so very shoort. And the tallest i'll grow is your height!  I want to be a face character so bad.  But cinderella has to be in the height of 5'6-5'9 or something.  The height requirements we fall in is the 4'10-5'2 which is Wendy darling from Peter pan, Alice in Wonderland, or I'm pretty sure a pixie hollow fairy.    Work on your accents if you have a character with one, dance, acting watch the movies of that character etc..  I think there's stuff about the college program here,, and much more about the auditions and videos, and a lot more!    http://corporate.disney.go.com/auditions...    Hope i hellped  :)|`|AQhJJT91aa	First thing to remember is no GOOFing off and get your DUCKS in a row.|`|CCUGKYi5aa	Dancing is a big part of the characters that perform in the parades. As far as the characters that walk around the park and take pictures with people, take acting classes, specifically improvisation classes because that will be a part of the audition process. There's usually more than one Cinderella, one for parades and another for walking around the park (not always though depends on who is working, who is trained for what, etc).     Another HUGE part of auditions is the look. For a face character, meaning no masks, you have to look EXACTLY like the character. You have to be the right size, have the right look, everything. For characters such as Mickey or Minnie where you can't see their faces the specifications are less strict. You just need to be able to fit into the costume and to be able to act the part.|`|wKo5P7ueaa	hmm.. i always wanted to work there too! :)

B17VheFgaa	Rockband has better graphics, gameplay and music.  GH has very poor quality parts (My drum kit snapped) and the graphics on it are very "8 Bit" ish.. You can see the pixels and can tell it was poorly done.  On top of that, the GH drum notes dont align with the music (I.E: they are random and dont even come close to the real beat, I am a drummer) and the cymbals on the GH kits move up and down so much that you can do 16th hi-hat notes easily.      Rockband also has a lot more downloadable content and is gaining more interest to the public.     To all GH fanboys:  Harmonix, the company that built Rockband, was also the founder of Guitar Hero.  They left after Gibson and other companies wanted more power.  When rockband released the separate cymbal kit, the GH guy went crazy because they "copied" him.  My response:  Who started the whole "band" thing anyways? You have no room to say anything about copying, especially because they were the ones who started your business and have brought you into loads of cash.    Thanks.|`|tJa60S4Taa	I don't know, Rock Band 2 is a better party game, while GHWT is a better solo experience (in my opinion). All else is pretty much equal.|`|Z7RiriL6aa	Ok. I have both games, and let me say, with the exception of about 5 songs, the setlist is EXACTLY the same for both games. However, Rock band 2 uses these annoyingly small squares instead of circles, like Guitar Hero, and Rock Band's notes are cramped together also, which makes solos harder to play. Guitar Hero WT also has a song-making feature, and a touch-sensitive slidebar on the guitar controller that is way cool. GH also has alot more downloadable content, as in songs. I sold my Rock band back, and I say buy Guitar Hero, its worth every penny. Plus, all the tracks in Guitar Hero are master (real) tracks, not copies.|`|SvoukfsBaa	doesnt really matter... both have the drums and everything...|`|7QN9wetGaa	i say guitar hero world tour  is dope =]  i have it nd is jst ku nd you can also download songs  nd stuff  the drums is fun also wit the bass nd guitar as well as vocals  get it|`|UnWOkO6paa	Rock band 2 all the way man!|`|PxV1znXQaa	Get them both, you could buy the whole set of Rockband 2 and get just the game of Guitar Hero:World Tour because they would most likely be compatible search on Google "Rockband instruments compatible with Guitar Hero:WT on Wii" if they aren't, you should get Rockband 2 because it has an awesome party system.

We've had guitar hero in the past, but we find the Rock Band design and band tour modes more fun. The real selling point for us though was that Guitar Hero has songs from the bands you love but not the songs you want, whereas Rock Band has some great bands, some you don't know so well, but every song is awesome to play and I've loved them all. Also, Rock Band has like every song available for download for a cheap price, so if you do want to play particular songs, Rock Band is your best bet.  We were told that Guitar Hero had a better drum kit-like that it more closely resembled actually playing the drums, but we decided that since it was a game anyway, we weren't too fussed about that. The drums are extremely fun to play, I've never played real drums properly lol so I don't know whether they're realistic or not, just that it's fun.|`|UjG8hBAMaa	that's a hard one rock band2 is fantastic but guitar hero world tour would be more realistic due to cymbals but you could buy a drum with symbols for rock band2 so i'd say both but if i had to choose one it would be guitar hero world tour overall guitar hero is better in my opinion|`|dmvm98M8aa	Rock band is good and all, but Guitar Hero World Tour has better drums and better guitar. But this is only my opinion so do what ever you feel like doing.

Maybe you should just try to uninstall it (use the uninstall that you find if you click on Start and then on the game, don't try to uninstall it using add/remove programs cause that messes up a lot of EA games if you uninstall it that way) and then try to reinstall it.  Hopefully it won't mess up the second time.    Oh, but maybe rinse the disk under water then carefully wipe it dry (not in circles -- go from the center ring outwards instead) with a lint-free cloth before you try to reinstall it.

mTNz8GHGaa	It sounds like you missed getting a Small Key before you entered the area with the hand that grabs you. These hands are called Wallmasters, and if they get you, you're transported back to the beginning of the temple.    Wallmasters seem to come with no warning, but they do have some signs. The first time you enter an area with a Wallmaster, Navi will stop you and say "Beware of the shadows that hang from the ceiling!" This is your first clue that there's a Wallmaster nearby.    The second clue is a sound, like fast-moving wind, that comes just before the Wallmaster descends. You'll also be able to see a growing shadow over where Link is. When you hear/see it, RUN! The Wallmaster will drop to the floor, but miss you.  It'll look for Link briefly, but ascend again when it can't find him. The time it spends looking for Link is best spent running away to get through the area.     Also, Wallmasters cannot grab you if youre on a ladder. If you hear the warning sound and know theres a ladder you can climb nearby, run for it! The Wallmaster will quit its descent as soon as you get on it.     Here's a walkthrough for the Forest Temple:    Go forward and kill the two Wolfos, then go to the side and climb the vines there (after taking out the Skulltula with your Hookshot. Aren't those things ANNOYING?!). At the top is a bunch of branches and a chest, in it is a Small Key. Drop back down and go through the door, the hall, and enter the main room of the dungeon. After the cinema showing the Poe Sisters, go forward and through the doors. Kill the Flaming Skull by bouncing it off your shield and then hitting it as it bounces around, helpless. At the end you'll find two Stalfos! Kill them with your best swordfighting techniques. Just remember that you can't block their lunge with your shield, so do a backflip (back and A while in Battle Mode) to avoid it, then do a lunge of your own to really hurt them. After they are dead, break the pots, one of them has a Fairy if you need it. Your prize is another Small Key. Exit back to the Main Room.    In a tunnel nearby is a blue block, destroy it by playing The Song of Time. Go through the door it was blocking. Climb the wall to your right, but you might want to kill the Skulltulas first, but one will still be left because it's out of the Hookshot's range. So when climbing, go slow and quickly go up when it looks away, since it won't charge if it can't see you! Go through the door in the small alcove...Kill the Blue Flaming Skull to receive the Map in a chest. Go through the next door. Look to your left; see that white target? That's a Hookshot target, if you can hit it with your Hookshot you'll be pulled towards it! Do so, then hit the switch that is there. It will drain the nearby well. Drop down into the water (if you hit land it will hurt you) and go inside. After a long path you'll get another Small Key! Now climb back out, then return to the Main Room through the door that brought you here.     Go through the locked door that is in front of you, across the chamber. Go through the hallway with the Giant Skulltula, then into the next room. Climb the ladders, then pull out the stone block so it fits the little area. Push it, following the arrows painted on the floor. Go to where the block originally was, then follow that path to find the block again. Now push it into place! You'll hear that chime that means you got a secret. Use it as a stepping stone to the above area. Alright, pull the red stone as far as it will go. You can't pull it all the way out, however, due to the lack of space. Go back to where the blue stone originally was, there's a ladder. Climb it, then turn right to find a little fence. In the wall, to the right, before the fence, is a small alcove where you can push the red block totally out! Now return to the red block via the blue block and push it into place! Whew...    Follow the path to the end where you will find a locked door, un-lock it then go through. Run across the twisted corridor, at the end is an area with another locked door. You have one Small key left...well, guess what to do next! Now you'll fight a lonely Stalfos. Note that although he can walk over the hole in the center, you CAN'T! When he's dead the hole will be covered and two more will warp in. Unlike the last one, if you kill one it won't disappear, it will just fall to pieces. If you take too long (trying) to beat the last one then it will re-assemble itself! Even if you're new to the game this shouldn't be THAT hard (ok, I admit I had some trouble with this, but...). Dispatch them and you'll receive the Fairy Bow!! Woohoo! Now you're really dangerous...exit the room.    See that Poe in the painting? Shoot it from afar with your bow. After doing this to three different paintings (if you get to close, however, it will go away to another painting) it will come out. Z-target it and hit it with a bow! Then it will disappear. Get out your bow. If it starts spinning wildly simply sidestep. When it re-appears, hit it. Do this until it dies. An even faster way is to do a lunge with your Sword...It will give you the Compass. Return to the Stalfos room, then go through the next door. You'll repeat the same process, except this time the Poe is red! Also, it will give you a Small Key instead.     Now, go back to the Twisted Hallway. Actually, the room BEFORE it. See the eyeball above the doorway? Peg it with an arrow, the resulting effect will un-twist the twisted hallway. Now go through it and drop to the floor, open up the purdy chest and you'll get the Boss Key. Now drop down into the hole in the ground. Kill the Blue Skulls, then go through the un-locked doorway. The best way to defeat the giant Deku Baba is to stun it with the Hookshot, then use your sword (do a lunge for one hit to kill! It's A in Battle Mode, duh). Go in the door to the right...Now you must kill a Floormaster! Z-target it a|`|Ez4svBtXaa	first grab a spider bomb then throw it in the mouth of the monster|`|dhw6ls0vaa	I've played that game... past that part, bt sorry I don't know the answer... look up cheats on google|`|UjG8hBAMaa	k sorry for being stupid but i haven't played the game in years so is this the place where you go inside the tree at the begining of the game or after the zora level where you get eaten by the fish|`|ys26TNwMaa	Forest Temple - Small Key Guide  As you explore the Forest Temple, you'll require five Small Keys. If you come to a locked door as you follow my directions to the Boss Key and other items in the Temple, use this guide to determine which Small Keys you may have missed.   Small Key One - From the Temple entrance, climb up the vines on the right and get onto the tree branch. Use the Hookshot on the treasure chest to reach the other tree with a treasure chest. Open the chest for a Key.   Small Key Two - From the Temple entrance, go forward through two doors to enter the main room with the unlit braziers. Continue forward across the room and go up on the ledge. Walk up the steps, enter the next two doors and defeat the two Stalfos Knights to make a treasure chest appear. Open it for a Key.   Small Key Three - From the Temple entrance, go forward and enter the next two doors. In the main chamber with the unlit torches, follow the left wall to reach a large block. Play the Song of Time to remove the block and enter the door in the corner to appear in a courtyard area with water and vines. Follow the right wall, go up the vines in the corner and enter the door. Go through the next door to reach a balcony in another courtyard area.   Use the Hookshot to reach the next balcony and step onto the red floor switch to lower the water in the well. Facing the switch, get on railing on the right and drop down to the water below. Get out of the water and go to the alcove to the left of the only door to reach the well. Climb down the ladder in the well. Walk to the other end of the ledge and open the small treasure chest for a Key.   Small Key Four - In the room where the Bow was found, go through the only door which doesn't have swirl above it. Use the Bow to hit the Poe Sister ghost, Joelle, when she's trapped in a picture. Hit all of the pictures to make Joelle appear, then defeat her for a Key.   Small Key Five - Go to the room where the Boss Key was found and fall down the hole. Defeat the two enemies and exit through the door. Go to the right, enter the first door and defeat the Floormaster. Open the treasure chest that appears for a Key.     those are all the keys and where/how to find them|`|7FAZYMy3aa	Ok when you're walking around and you see your shadow grow, run away, then look back you should see that the hand has failed to kidnap you. Kill it! You'll get like 5 blue rupees.    If you haven't already shot the eye with your bow go back to the door and do so. The hallway wont be twisted anymore and you can jump into the hole on the floor.    For additional help go to http://www.zelda.com/ocarina    I actually just got past the Forest Temple Yesterday|`|tFhrnchBaa	Those hands I think are called Floor Masters? They try to sneak up on you from above, so when you see their shadow coming down, jump out of the way at the last second then attack it.    Sorry haven't played the game in a while so I don't know about the key, just keep trying and Good Luck!

J08K6Fqeaa	With the short time you'll be there, you'll want to make every minute count! Buy "The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2009". Read it, study it, and use the touring plans in the back of the book. My family and I went in July 2008, a very busy time of the year for Disney. We never waited in line for any ride more than 15 minutes!     In short, its difficult to answer you question in a small paragraph. The above book is an easy read and will answer many questions that you'll have on the way.|`|4jk4VdwEaa	definatley ride the hulk roller coaster and go to the dr seus thing. lol|`|I2frHIj1aa	Don't miss out on Rock N Roller coaster! Its short but my fave by far. That's at MGM. There's also the new roller coaster at animal kingdom the expedition Everest one, or how ever you spell it- you cant miss it its a huge thing the looks like a mountain. At Epcot theres Test Track. I found I really like the show at MGM called "lights motors action", its pretty neat, the cars do tons of stunts and they show how they do stuff in movies. Also at MGM theres Tower of Terror, ive never been on it because I don't like big drops, but my brother loves it. These also some other rides like Toy Story 3-d shooting that sounds like it would be for little kids but its fun!  And yes, magic kingdom is more for the younger kid, but you'll still find good things to do there like space mountain and splash mountain. If you can you should see about going to universal if you like roller coasters. Universal and Islands of Adventure are awesome!  If you still want to know more go to www.disneyworld.com and you can see what each park has for rides. Have fun! hope I helped.|`|dOjKgZ2naa	you need to really go to island of adventure if your into rollercoasters and fast rides. located in orlando next to disney world . unless u just want to take pictures with a mouse and a dog then you go to disney. or for that matter just sit home and watch some tom and jerry reruns .|`|z2cvfmdRaa	The Tower of Terror and the rockin roller coaster.  i thought i would hate tower of terror but its so awesome!!!!!!  These are at MGM while there check out the lights motors action stunt show really really neat.  as for the magic kingdom, i only went there for like an hour to watch the parade since my old teacher is/was in it. More towards little kids.  Also go to EPCOT great food and great rides.  The test track is awesome.  then there is one called high flyer ,i think, fun ride.  Use any search website, like google, and search disney parks for a lot of info.

3e2c9d9fa72fdfbc932f0b8af223560faa	There is no best, it is whatever you enjoy playing.  Personally I switch it up all the time.  I raid with a lock, but my arena whore is currently my DK(used to be a rogue), for BG it's a tossup between my hunter and DK, and for farming Lock, DK, hunter whatever, depends on the mobs.  Also, a class that is currently top on DPS may find itself in the toilet come a patch day, just ask my hunter.  Top DPS comes and goes, but pick something you enjoy.  Start a few classes and give them a while for a few days then pick which you like.  Many of the classes don't really come into their own till late in the game, but you can get the gist of them in a few days.  In the end I can't stress enough,  pick what you enjoy playing.|`|YO2U1BCEaa	You can change your Profs  to be anything, I love Shad priest and Jewel crafting/mining    Rogue//leather working/first aid    meh w/e|`|RmNVL1RWaa	hmmm... let me guess,   you wet yourself if you watch a movie for too long ( a rated r one)  you'd bag your own poo if it didn't go down the drain  sometimes, rainbow colors are okay to you      if you said yes to ANY of the following, youre a geek!|`|5Bf0oFEQaa	This is part of a ring of accounts used to give themselves best answer points and get free advertising by spamming their website.

MWpPzqGnaa	I work with a summer teen group and here are some of the activities we do:    Human Knot:  - everyone gathers in a group in the center of the room  - everyone sticks their right hand in the air, and grabs onto someones hand near them  - repeat with the left  - using team work, have them un-knot themselves, allowing "breaks" in the chain if it seems impossible to untie  - once un-knotted, everyone should be facing alternate directions    Human Obstacle Course:  - have some people stay to the side (and out of sight) while the rest of the group creates an obstacle course using objects in the room AND their bodies (ie- someone laying on the floor, someone in a bridge, someone laying across chairs, things along that line)  - take the people not in the course and break them into teams of two. have 1 person be the leader and the other the follower  - blindfold the follower, and have the leader take them through the obstacle course, leading them only with their voice (ie- "take two steps to the left" " crawl on your knees" "duck your head")  - after each follower has gone through the course, have the obstacles change and then switch leaders and followers  - keep switching so everyone who wants to gets to be a leader, a follower, and an obstacle    Square to Triangle:  - everyone hold hands and stand in a square  - have everyone close their eyes and try to make a triangle    Snowball (this isnt team building but its a lot of fun):  - have a circle of chairs set up. enough for everyone but 1 person  - that one person stands in the middle and says an "I never" such as "I've never ridden in an airplane"  - everyone who has ridden in an airplane stands up and switches seats, while the person in the middle tries to grab a vacated seat  - one person should always end up standing  - if the person in the middle says "snowball," then EVERYONE gets up and switches seats  - make it a rule that you have to move to a seat that is at least 2 away from your current one (if possible)    Hope these help, I know I've had a blast playing them!|`|AoDwbpTxaa	Manhunt is great, its a mix between freeze tag and hide and go seek.  -Split everyone into two teams, hiders and seekers. they don't need to be even, as long as there are less seekers than hiders if it's uneven.  -Make a "jail", it can be anything like a chair or something kind of big and easily seen, and tell the seekers to count to 20 or so while the hiders hide.  -After 20 seconds, the seekers will seek the hiders, and if one of the seekers tags one of the hiders, the seeker takes the hider to the jail, and they stay there. This is when it gets fun.  -When someone goes to jail, one of the other hiders can run up to him in jail and tag him so that he becomes free, and can run and hide again.  -When the seekers have everyone in jail, they win, and you can restart but switch the teams. I hope you have fun too :D. The first answerer's games also sounds like a lot of fun.

Im not to sure about HD for the Playstation 3 but you can ask someone at Best Buy. You will need the red, white, and yellow cords and the blue, green and red cords for the HD. And yes you plug them in by the color.|`|GmnsPmNMaa	You must have an HDMI cable.<br>  <br>  The colored cables you speak of are RCA cables.  They will not provide HD video output.<br>  <br>  You must buy a separate HDMI cable.  PS 3 doesn't come with HD cable.
ajnGHNr8aa	There are viewing areas that get you underwater with the animals and get some great pictures. They are located at the end of the dolphin tank and at the backside of Shamu's tank. Shamu is not always in this tank so you may have to try a couple of times. The Shark encounter has a moving sidewalk that goes through the actual tank thea holds the sharks. The penguin encounter allows you to watch the penguins as well, but you won't want to stay because the smell is horrible.<br>    If you want to actually interact with the animals it will cost you extra money. The Dolphin exhibit allows you to feed the dolphins and pet them. You might get lucky like the previous poster did and one will swim up to you outside the "feeding zone". There is a lunch/dinner show with Shamu but is expensive. The Sea Lion exhibit does not allow you to get too close to them, but you can feed them. You cannot get close enough to the Dolphin Nursery tank to really see them so it kinda stinks. The touch tank for the sea rays does not cost money but I would recommend spending the $5 to feed them as it is cool how they suck the food from your hand.<br>  Have a great time.|`|Zo7IQX3raa	yea|`|632BbbUtaa	you can get up close to dolphins and manta rays and a few other small animals at sea world in san diego. you can also get close to dolphins in the wild in san diego. la jolla beach to be exact. ive been in the water with dolphins swimming near by a few times|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	Now i am not sure about every Sea World in the US/world but i know that in Florida, you can see dolphins really close and if you are willing to buy special food, feed them.

9tQSBMAQaa	Card counting is only illegal if you are using a device to do so.  If you are doing it in your head, it is not illegal.  Casinos have about .05% advanage in black jack.  Card counters can sway this advantage to about 1% in favor of the player.  Casinos can refuse service to anyone, so if you are suspected of card counting, you will be asked to leave.  Sometimes forcefully.  Hope this answers your questions.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Yes, it's illegal you can get kicked out of casinos for life. That take it very serious. The pit-bosses will watch for it.|`|mKIA6V4Saa	Since the casinos make the rules, I guess both.|`|fscgp7iFaa	No its just frowned appon|`|At7WLduQaa	No there is no law against it, your aloud to count cards.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Unless you are using a mechanical device (or are in collusion with someone that is) then it is not illegal.    It is using math to turn the odds of the game into your advantage.    Casinos,  however,   can ban anyone they wish for any reason.    They tend to lump big time blackjack winners as card counters (and they consider it cheating,  but the law doesnt),   and will kick you out if they catch you doing it.    A good counter knows not only how to count the cards,  but how to hide the fact hes doing it.|`|vm5TgsQwaa	It pisses people off. Its cheating. If they find out your doing it- the angry gamblers will hurt you|`|vVUzDh8Caa	no it's not illegal but casinos reserve the right to make you leave.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	it's illegal and unethical and if they suspect you of counting cards, they will kick you out.|`|1oCUMOW7aa	no its not "illegal" but casinos will throw you out if they catch you doing it.|`|G3HxgCmvaa	Counting cards is by no means illegal. However if you get caught counting cards the casino owner will tell you to leave because they consider it cheating and are losing money fast.|`|hCiy0CF4aa	Don't worry you don't have the talent. Yes it is illegal|`|462fed2fe3ce1f4bcba1e73bb0da97adaa	its not illegal because all your doing is keeping track of the cards in your head. Your just using pure brian power. But casinos dont like it because you drain them of there money dat way. They want to sit at the table for hours and waste your money. If you notice there are no clocks in any casinos, thats because they dont want you to know how much time is passing by there for you just keep sitting there wasting money.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	Its an advanced playing strategy, you simply place bets and play out your hands using a very complex strategy, the result is a legitimate way to beat the game of blackjack.    Casinos use "inn keepers rights" to remove ANY person form their location weather that person be an obnoxious drunk, a beggar, or somebody who can effectively beat their games.    This is not true in atlantic city, where "players may not be barred for reasons of skill" courts in nj ruled that barring players for being able to count cards was in a sense discrimination, and they must be allowed to play    To answer your question, "the casinos just don't like it".    Iv been doing it for years and i still haven't gone to jail.|`|ND5KncX0aa	your cheating a company out of money. im not sure if its illegal but i know it will get you kicked out of the casino|`|aOQZ2ZAOaa	technically its not illegal...but casinos don't like it. if they even think you are they'll kick you out and hurt you badly.  watch 21 haha|`|RW72apDwaa	It's not illegal - you won't go to jail or anything for it - but in most places, casinos are allowed to kick you out if they suspect that you're counting cards. If they're not allowed to kick you out due to the laws in the area, they can force you to not vary your bet, which is the way that you gain an advantage when counting cards.|`|M6vMmafJaa	It frowned upon
AA11850311	After you got the sims from thesims2.com they would be in Sims2Pack files, which have round blue icons.  Just double-click on that icon to install them.  Since they are in Bodyshop, it sounds like you did that.  Now in order to play those sims, when you go to Create a Family, set the sim that's being built to the same age and gender as the downloaded sim you want.  Now click on the sim bin icon, it looks like 6 sims stacked together.  That will show all the pre-made and downloaded sims of that age/gender combination.
1Ad7jJgwaa	The Ultima Dragon is pretty badass. Definitely have only one of those. (There can only be one). Bone Dragons are indispensible, because they're made of bone, but they're tough. Collect a whole set in your graveyard. Fire Dragons, because dragons are known for their fire, and you gotta have'em. Mix it up, get like a few Rainbow Dragons, so you've got your bases covered. They can do everything. I'd definitely get a Flying Goblin Metal Dragon, because they do some serious firepower and they've got some cool special abilities. And lastly, get 2 Golden Dragons, because they make really good food.|`|3J0utfJXaa	Light and Darkness Dragon ^-^

You will be able to cut down the numbers by taking out  Despair from the Dark, double coston, and Patrician of Darkness . Zombie mammoth is nice but do you really wanna take the damage? As far as the traps go i would focus on the ones that kill/control your opponents monsters such as trap hole,Compulsory Evacuation Device, Torrential Tribute etc. GL!!!|`|LoRVjAYsaa	like the others said, try get Il Blud.  another card that's really good for zombie's is castle of dark illusions, it's a powerfull boost for a zombie deck!  also get some mezuki's, you said that you special summon alot, so why don't you use mezuki's? you can remove him from play to special summon 1 zombie type monster, what do you want more? it's like a monster reborn in a zombie deck!  the idea of 46 cards isn't that good, use only 40 cards, you will be able to use your combo's much quicker!|`|mHWsuqjZaa	just keep trying to get IL BLUD. It's a really sweet card. Plus it's really not that hard to get. You have got a 50-50 shot at getting it. Other than that I do not really like it, TeleZombie is the way to go! They are pretty sweet *** decks! They are also abit cheaper than TeleDAD, and they are just as good.     And your reason for having 46 cards in your deck is kind of dumb. Ok, put it this way what if the next 6 cards from your pile of 40 after you drew your 6 could get you an OTK. I usually keep it between 40 and 43, no more than that.|`|xB0vOgSwaa	its ok...youve got the basics but an il blud would help...theyre really cheap and easy to get so just trade for one or two....honestly im kinda tired of helping with zombie decks because honestly a normal zombie deck isnt that strong anymore...go with tele zombie or zombie synchro (my fave)

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Several things:    More freedom:  Programmers should be allowed to do whatever they want instead of copying what is successful.  That's why we see so many sequels and imitations and no new ideas.    More time:  Programmers have only a certain amount of time to make a game, and that's not good enough.  They work under a deadline, and if they don't make the deadline, their job could be in jeopardy, so many of them just keep making what works.    Gamers need to buy games that are different instead of buying the same old games over and over again.  If more people were buying LittleBigPlanet or Katamari, then there would be more original games, but gamers keep buying Halo, GTA, MGS, so programmers keep making those games.      Gamers also need to support independent game makers.  There are a lot of good games made by independent game makers on PSN, XBL, and VC, but very few people are buying them.

I recommend you give them your real one because this is easier for verification. If you give them your spam one you might accidentally delete it. The site doesn't spam you its all the offers you will be doing that send the junk email.<br>  <br>  They also ask for your address. Don't worry too much about this all they need your address for is to mail you prizes.<br>  <br>  After you signup they will send you a confirmation link to your email address you entered. Click the link and you're done. The email should come pretty quick (usually instantly). And make sure you check your spam folders.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Complete Offers<br>  <br>  Once inside you can check out the prize list.<br>  <br>  To earn points click on "Available Offers". There you will see a whole list of offers and how many points you'll get if you complete that offer. When filling out an offer you don't have to give your real home address or phone number. And make sure you use your spam email account because believe me you will be spammed. Also, be sure to check your email occasionally for those offers that require email confirmation otherwise you won't get credited for completing the offer properly.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips for filling out offers:<br>  1. Read the offer carefully so you know exactly what to do to get the points.<br>  2. Delete cookies before every offer<br>  3. Complete offer with realistic information<br>  4. Use a browser that accepts cookies and turn your security down<br>  5. Let each page load completely<br>  <br>  Also remember that even though most of the time you'll get the points 5-10 minutes after completing the offer, some may take up to a day or more (depending on the offer). So don't worry if you don't see the points just keep going they will appear if you've done everything correctly.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Claim Your Prize<br>  <br>  After you have enough points you can now go to "Available Prizes" and see what you can cash those points in for. This is the fun part. =)<br>  <br>  They have a ton of prizes. You'll see stuff like consoles (Xbox, PS3, Wii), video games, iPods, etc. There are Xbox Live cards in the "Xbox" section and will be emailed to you. Physical prizes like iPods and video games will deliver so make sure your address is correct before you claim a prize that requires shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, something many people don't realize is that if you don't see anything you like you can actually send a request for a custom prize. Just send support a ticket with a link to what you want from amazon.com and they'll let you know how many points you'll need. Basically it will be a point for every dollar. <br>  <br>  Thats it!<br>  hope i could help.<br>  message me, if you have any questions.|`|uul3Wt3Caa	you can go to gaminglagoon.com  <br>  they really do give you free stuff.  i myself have gotten 1600 points in the mail and a 25$ itunes gift card.  if you decide to do the surveys, make up a fake e-mail address because you will get a ton of spam.  you usually dont even have to enter in real information.

M7G3MZb5aa	the high/lo system is THE MOST popular card counting system in exhistance, in fact, in recent survey taken on the web by 129 card counters, 48 of them (37.2%) used the high lo system. The next most popular system was the KO system    the point values for the high/lo system are....  2-6 (+1)  7,8,9 (0)  10/ace (-1)    The count represents/measures change in the house advantage as a result of the cards seen being removed from the game, this is why the point assignments are backwards in some people's minds because positive numbers are actually assigned to cards that when dealt hurt the players odds, but when REMOVED FROM THE GAME have the opposite effect, when you are in a positive count it means an excess of cards of this type have been removed form the game.    Since the count measures change by removal of cards, and at the begining of a freshly shuffled deck, there are no cards removed, and no change in the odds, you would start at 0, as cards are dealt you add them to form the RUNNING COUNT (RC), and keep track of it in your head at all times, anytime a card is removed from the game you add its point value to the RC, wether it be a card dealt in the game, a card that falls on the floor, a card thats in your pocket whatever, if its removed from the game, you count it.    ****THE RUNNING COUNT IS OF LITTLE SIGNIFIGANCE****    You then must convert the RC into the TRUE COUNT (TC) by dividing the RC by the number of decks left undealt, to figure the number of decks left undealt you look at the discard tray and see how many decks were dealt (visually) and deduct it from the total number of decks in play (which you must also know)    TC=RC divided by number of decks remaining to be dealt.    ****THE TC EFFECTS ALL PLAYING DECISIONS****    The tc will be almost directly proportional to....important concept here...."the change in hosue advantage as a result of the removal of cards from the game"    ******FOR EVERY POINT OF TC THE HOUSE EDGE IS EFFECTED BY ~0.5%*******    ^------Not considered by vary many card counters who place bets erronously    If the count is positive, it means the odds have shifted in the favor of the player, if its negetive they have shifted in the favor of the casino.    To determine if the player has an edge, you must add the change in the house advantage as shown by the count to the EXHISTING HOUSE ADVANTAGE, which varries based on the rules of the game.  Use this link to figure the house advantage of the game you are playing.... http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/house-...    Once you detect that enough cards have been removed and the player has an advantage, you can sit down and place a bet!!!! heres the catch though, in order to win money, you must play PERFECT strategy, not only that but you must play ADVANCED PLAYING STRATEGY, which is a step beyong basic playing strategy, fist you need to learn basic strategy, use this link to find the strategy for the game you are playing because it also changed slightly based on the rules.... http://www.blackjackinfo.com/bjbse.php    Advanced playing strategy is what results form the card counter modifiing playing strategy based on the **TC** by using what are known as indexes, index are different for different counting systems so these numbers are only for the high/lo...ONLY FOR THE HI/LO SYSTEM!!!    When a ***TC*** is at or above an index with a positive number assigned, you make the play for that index, however if a negetive number is assigned, you make the play when the ***TC*** is AT opr BELOW the number.    16v10 +0 stand  16vs9 +5 stand  16vs8 +8 stand  15vs10 +4 stand  15vs9 +8 stand  12vs2 +4 stand  12vs3 +2 stand  12vs4 -0 hit  12vs5 -1 hit  12vs6 -0 hit  11vsACE +1 double  10vsACE +4 double  10vs10 +4 double  10vs9 -1 hit (no double)  9vs2 +1 double  9vs7 +4 double  8vs6 +2 double  8vs5 +4 double  A,9vs6 +5 double  A,9vs5 +5 double  A,9vs4 +7 double  A,8vs6 +1 double  A,8vs5 +2 double  A,8vs4 +3 double  A,8vs3 +6 double  A,2vs4 +3 double  A,3vs4 +2 double  10,10vs6 +5 split  10,10vs5 +5 split  10,10vs4 +7 split  9,9vs7 +4 split DAS  9,9vsACE +3 split DAS  7,7vs8 +2 split only when DAS (double after splitting alowed)  3,3vs8 +4 split only DAS  2,2vs8 +6 split only DAS      And lastly, no matter what hand you have, you take insurance on it when the TC is above 3, or in multi deck games 3.1 is acceptable. But 3 works for reasons known as "risk aversion", im not explaining      There a lil more than that, but thats enough to make money at the game.|`|y822j5h5aa	At certain times in blackjack the card count will go up or go down during the course of playing a shoe.     When the count goes up, it is the time to increase your bet, as a general rule. Counting the cards is one theing, knowing how to bet is another, and more important thing!    Here is a link that explains the HiLo system and provides some information on how to use the information to adjust your bets, whether the count is high or low.    http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/bla...

PxV1znXQaa	To make a guild, it takes a lot of mesos. First, you need 1.5million mesos and 6 people in a party. The leader of the party is the one who will be making the guild. Then you head to Orbis. Everyone in the party need to be in Orbis or the guild won't be made. Then you need to talk to Heracle and he will ask you for the money and then for the name of the guild. Be original. Then you can make an Emblem (the picture in front of the name of the guild). This is 5million mesos. So total is 6.5 million mesos. Then if you want to expand the guild, you need more money. For the first expansion (5 people), you'll need 500k. The second is 1.5 million and is 5 more people. The third is 2.5 million and is 5 more people again. The fourth is 3.5 million but it is an expansion of 30 more people. Only 100 people can be in a guild. Also, if you decide to get rid of your guild, you'll need 200k for that. Like I said, making a guild is very expensive and hard to keep all the member. Be careful who you choose to be Jr. master because they can mess up your guild when you are absent.|`|1hegS9YBaa	you make a guild in orbis.

IfXJk1qoaa	There is no set distance.  You and the person you are playing set it up as you so choose.  You can lump it all in the center, keep it around the table edge, or evenly disperse it throughout the table.  Use different set-ups; you'll be surprised at how a game will turn out with the terrain set-up just slightly different.    To keep things even when setting up terrain, both of you roll a die.  Highest roll selects a piece of terrain to place and places it anywhere on the board.  Then the other player places a piece of terrain.  Continue until all terrain has been placed.
zSdeMhvAaa	i always think teliphone is fun. or a BIG game of spoons! or there is a game called ive never... someone is in the middle and they say something they have never done. anything at all. for example i would say i have never been out of country! (people sit in a circle all around on  s. if there is 20 ppl then there is 19  s cuz 1 person is in the middle.) everyone then who has done what i have never done gets up and quickly goes to another   and the person in the middle finds a   too! the person who doesnt get a   has to be in the middle    Another game is the one where u have someon tell 3 truths and 1 lie! everone has to guess wat one is the lie!|`|AoDwbpTxaa	Try manhunt. It's the same as hide and go seek except a big change: theres JAIL. This is how you play:    First, you split into two teams, one team is the people it and the others are hiding. They don't have to be even. The people that are it go counting to 20 at the base or w/e number you want, and the hiders hide. Then, all the people that are it go and try to find the people hidden. If they find you and tag you, they take you to jail where you sit there until one of the other hiders tags you, and then your free. It's like playing freeze tag with hide and go seek, except theres a jail where all the people tagged go to. TONS of fun, good luck!|`|nIjQ6skxaa	SARDINES!!!!!    It's like hide and seek, only more fun!    How you play is someone is "it" and goes and hides somewhere in the church, They have 2 minutes to hide. Everyone goes to find them, but when they find the person, they HIDE WITH THE PERSON THAT IS HIDING. The game is over once everyone has found "it". The first person that found "it" is the new "it". It can go on and on!      OOPs lol i didnt see that last paragraph.

The only way to win the lottery is to buy a ticket, check your own numbers, and claim your prize.    In the US alone there are over $50m in unclaimed prizes.  No one bothers to check up on you and make sure you claim.  If you don't claim, you lose the prize after 180 days.    Unless you have a ticket that you have purchased, and have verified the numbers on the official site, you have not won.  Plain and simple.
i5QONmV5aa	Do every quest you can using your skiller's skills, then get 20 strength and attack(for mithril) and train your defense, until it becomes too high, and inefficient for training, then train your strength and attack to 50, and your defense to 99.    The key is keeping your HP low though, remember that, if a quest has HP experience do NOT do it.

4owr19vCaa	I have ordered from them several times and not had an issue, it has been painless every time.       In reading your details, it sounds like it was not a problem at all and you were simply a bit impatient with the lack of immediate response on their part from your first order and decided to place a second order, then got confirmations for both orders.    If it has not shipped yet, I am sure you can call their customer service and they will cancel one of the orders with a credit for the amount.  They do have excellent customer service, I will be very surprised if the do not do that for you.      cheers|`|xEI2sXKMaa	it's just a poorly made website,  id find another one.
9ECwMzZXaa	Savage Lands is considered as a Black, Green and Red land at the same time.     Because it is not a basic land, the 4 card limit per deck still applies.

VpGfonpqaa	Both are fun, with WoW you have to pay a monthly $15 in addition to buying the game. With guild wars, you only have to buy the game and there's no monthly fee to play the game.    Guild wars is strictly fighting, there's no trade skills your characters can have which makes it a bit difficult to get a large amount of money. WoW has fighting and trade skills which help you earn gold for your character and allows you to not rely on vendors as much as you would have to do with guild wars.    If you have a lot of time on your hands and can afford the monthly $15 fee, then get WoW. But if you don't have much time on your hand and just generally want to play the game for fighting, leveling up and don't want to pay any money besides buying the game, then get Guild Wars.    If you're still not sure, download the trial of WoW and play it, then download the trial of guild wars and play it. Decide which one you like better and go get it.|`|do7i1Inuaa	I have played bothand I would have to say Warcraft. It has better support, community, and content. Granted I have to pay a monthly fee but that goes to supporting a fun game. It is just like the Xbox Live and PS Network (or whateveritiscalled) debate. Xboxlive is better than PS but the PSN is free. The monthly fee is the trade off of having support or not if anything bad happens. Also,WoW is rapidly growing in population. I think it is up to 11.5 million! I don't have numbers for GW but it is nowhere close.    All-in-all, i have had a bettertime with WoW than GW. On a side note get the 10-free trial for WoW. If you like it buy a 2-month subsciption at Walmart or Target. It is cheaper than the 1-month.     FOR THE HORDE!|`|oihouY7Naa	Both are good. I believe in Guild wars you don't have to pay monthly where in WOW you do.

9ceFtYSQaa	It depends what kind of horror you are afraid of I own Dead Space and it is a messed up game it's so brutal and bloody I love it, but if you don't like games with pop outs this would not be a good game for you because the monsters pretend to be dead and then stand up and slice you. I suggest if you got scared during resident evil 4 you should NOT get Dead Space. I've played a lot of scary games and this one is DEFINITELY the scariest.|`|wrhRjwKaaa	I still haven't beat RE4, I got scared in that game, and never want to go back to it. When my roommate rented Dead Space I saw how sick the graphics were and had to try it, He jumped several times, and he wasn't even halfway through the game. I wanted to just go ahead and try it without the lights on, so I played the first 4 chapters without the lights on, and only jumped like once or twice. So it depends on the person, I am usually scared, but I wasn't, and my roommate does MMA, and he jumped a lot, and he had his lights on.. so IDK|`|S0feEphSaa	well u might get freaked out by dead space. it's usually dark on that game and it's quiet when you're walking through the levels especially when you're in a vacuum then u can't hear the monsters coming cuz ur in space. they put eerie music on when there is a necromorph nearby and hate to tell u this but yea there are lots of suprises in this game. things will pop out at u from no where but u just gotta remember it's a game. i'll give u some tips always peep around corners on that game and watch out for vents because thats usually were they come from.    it was kinda scary to me but it's also fun u should still get it|`|418ea9bc9f77352bba734f45cd41ebe8aa	Download the demo and see how it is, but for me it wasnt that scary things do come running at you and sometimes they lie on the floor and you think they are dead, but there not

Honestly the most effective halo players, especially those north of level 40 use a sniper BR combo as much as possible. If you can get good at the snipe, scoped and no scoped, you would be pretty set. a one shot with the snipe followed a quick BR draw and 1 shot to the head is the preferred method. This is the best way to get kills and not die yourself. most people in close to medium range engagements tend to run towards each other. with the update, they both end up dying from melee hits on each other. and if you don't your probably easy left overs. so the sniper and BR offer a good distance between you and others. My advice: get good with a sniper.

2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You have 3 choices of where to go right now, and 2 of them are fairly close. One is westfall as the first two answerers mentioned. The second is Loch Modan, just east of Dun Morogh where Ironforge is located. If you get tired of Westfall, take the tram from Stormwind (the human city) to Ironforge (the Dwarven city) and then walk along the road headed east. You'll go thru a couple of tunnels and emerge in Loch Modan, a really nice area with monsters and quests up to about level 15.<br>  <br>  Alternatively you could leave the continent, go back to the continent you started on (Darnassus is the city there) and do quests along the area called "Darkshore".|`|4oyDKNHAaa	go to westfall, it should be towards the south, there you will find some missions and creatures closer to your level|`|WalnRzfGaa	you are in a low area for your level head over to westfall which is west of the area you are in. you will find creatures level 11-18 there and there is also a dungeon you can do there ( Deadmines).

The better you do on the levels the more clothing you will get (example if you finish the tundra level you get the neon skin (it glows in the dark)).  Some custom clothing jobs have been done (probably the Sonic costume). There are community levels and YouTube videos that will show you how to do that.

There's some info about epoxy resins and polyurethanes on these pages at my site:  http://glassattic.com/polymer/other_mate...  http://glassattic.com/polymer/finishes.h...    It might be eaiser though to put something inside the boot that would actually contain the money but perhaps be hidden lower in it ... like a jar or some other kind of container, etc.  That structure (or perhaps stuffing around it) would also stiffen up the whole boot.    Or you could just glue something cylindrical and sturdy to the inside of the boot to give more support...perhaps a cardboard tube, PVC pipe, etc.    Not sure how you'd want to make one bank from a *pair* of boots though, if that's what you meant.

EzPYcgQgaa	answering your main question i have never played it|`|P61fL9F5aa	The best website I've ever found for hints is www.uhs-hints.com. It is a website of walkthroughs but it is organized so that you get the answer click by click. Just type the game into the search box (or click the letter it begins with and scroll through the page) then choose the level or area you are stuck on. From there you can choose which part you need help on and since each puzzle is divided into many hints, just how much help you need.

zfiBHtbVaa	Asking girls to contact you is dangerous nowadays    If you were offering your Wii Friend code or an avatar name in an MMORPG, this would be different.

I recommend just going to buy it and than if any of your friends have any of the expansion packs (eg. Sims 2 Pets, Glamour Life, Sims 2 Seasons, etc.) ask your friends for the expansion packs and than you can download their expansion packs onto your Sims 2 game. But you have to have Sims 2 AND you also have to have an expansion pack that you own. When you download expansion packs you HAVE TO put in the CD that you last downloaded so YOU would have to own the CD. Most Sims games have come down a lot in price. I got my Sims 2 at Wal-Mart for around $50 and now I've seen them around $30. If you really like Sims 2 than try getting Sims 3. I have'nt heard any reviews about it but from what I've seen, It looks really good.      *Hope I helped  If you have any more questions feel free to message me|`|PxTLTTxSaa	Any place you can download it for free is illegal. If you want it, you should buy it like everyone else has to.
rMcgCAN8aa	I don't exactly remember but I think it was because they stole the design and Ideas from some other company|`|SUKdrAkGaa	i remember reading an article, i think on yahoo.  if i remember correctly, the maker of bratz used to work for mattel (the maker of barbie) and now mattel is suing because bratz are too similar to barbies|`|pN0Xiz7naa	Ummm.. i belive beacuse of the Bratz Babies and how they are like wearing thong type things as underwear and a little showing clothes.    HoPe I hElPeD!|`|Zzg0wQTPaa	In addition to the guy's answer above me, barbie was modeled after a swinger, it's possible they're being sued for being too perverse.|`|0U27Xg2daa	First poster is almost correct.    Mattel sued the maker of the Bratz line (MGA) because it turned out that the Bratz doll was designed by a former employee of Mattel while that employee was still working at Mattel. Which means that the Bratz doll was designed on Mattel time which in turn means that Mattel owns the Bratz design. Anything you design on company time belongs to that company.    Mattel sued for $100,000,000 and won. Mattel now legally owns the Bratz line. They then ordered a halt to all Bratz doll production.     Good riddance to the slutty whore dolls.

eHXZRohxaa	defiantly the idle speed. It's a screw that needs to be adjusted but i'm not sure where it is on the warhead motor because every engine is set out differently. i would take it to a hobby shop near you and they will tune it up BUT stay there with them and get one of the guys to run over the engine with you. this is a good thing to do because when ur out their you may need to adjust the motor ur self because things change depending on the temperature of the day eg. hot day - needs to run richer, cold day - needs to run leaner. if you can learn about your motor and what to do then you enjoy your car more because you will feel as though you can actully fix it/adjust it yourself. The best way to learn is from the pros at ur hobby shop.  g luck|`|VhR7QaKYaa	Nitro Cars aren't desghned to be messed with, Take it to your local Hobie store and let them fix it and then leave it alone and enjoy it

The needle pulls the thread from that alignment in the bobbin.  Obviously other machines may work differently and you didn't mention a brand.|`|AA12042448	For most machines with a removable bobbin case, hold your thumb down on the bobbin in the case, drag the thread sideways through the little slot and pull it toward the little square hole.  You should hear a little 'snik' sound when it's properly seated.    For drop-in bobbins, things are a little different.  Drop the bobbin into the case (it's fixed in the machine, and looks like a small hole where the bobbin goes.)  Check around this area to see if there's a little arrow.  If so, make sure the thread comes off the bobbin in that direction.  Find the slot on one side of the bobbin case.  Put your thumb on the bobbin itself and pull the thread through the slot in the side of the case.  Again, you should hear a little 'snik' sound when it's properly seated.

AA11850311	Yes, http://modthesims2.com is all free!  Everything there is scanned to be virus and hack free, unless of course it specifically states that it is a game hack or mod.  It is the only site I trust 100%  When you set up your account, you can have the site show you only items that are compatible with your configuration of expansion packs.  If you download and install the custom content correctly 99%+ of the items there will work.  The basics are as follows  Only get items that are compatible with your games.  If the item requires Pets, but you don't have Pets, don't get it!  It can seriously mess up your game at worst, or at best, just not show up in-game.  Custom Content must be placed in the correct folder    My Documents / EA Games / Sims2 / Downloads      Putting CC in your Program Files or on your desktop will not work.  Custom content must be extracted.  Putting .zip or .rar files in the Downloads folder will not work, you must un-compress those files.  Most files when uncompressed will be .package files, but sometimes they will be Sims2Pack files.  Sims2Pack files will have a round blue icon with a person or house in the middle.  These are most often complete sims, or lots.  You must double click on the blue icon to get those files to install.  Sometimes custom content requires a separate file called a mesh to be downloaded as well.  Creators should make a note of that, and provide a link.  (Custom content showing up as the same default clothing or hair style often means you did not get the required mesh)  The guide below has more complete instructions on installing custom content.  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...|`|J7o7FtZdaa	You might have to turn Custom Content on in your Sims game. To do that, go to options. I'm not sure which subcategory it's in, so you have to look around until you find the one that says Custom Content then click "on" or something similar to that. Then it should show up in your game. And yes it's free.
