20090227051447AAyNZGl	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Driving Instructor Applying Brake A Lot ?	I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with my driving instructor .   I'm booked in to take my test in 2 weeks & after I've been in the car with him I feel less confident about the test .      My main problem is the dual control pedals on his side . I was always told they shouldn't use them unless it's an emergency or you've done something very wrong or illegal .      We were in a 50 km/h zone & the light about 150-200 meters ahead had just turned orange & the next car was about that distance away & he started braking for me already .      Another time we were at a stop sign , a car just passed & I was safe to cross , then when I lifted my foot off the brake & onto the accelerator & the engine revved & I realized his foot was on his brake . He said to me " you're free to go thru " & I said " I know but your foot is on the brake " , he followed with " oh , sorry about that " .      Then lastly , I went to go around a corner - no cars in the street behind me , in front or in the street I was turning into & halfway around the corner he puts on the brake & said I should look more , but I was sitting there for the recommended minimum 5 second .      Is it right for him to do this ?      Sorry , this is so long .

The truck doesn't start to make a noise until I drive it for a few minutes.  Then it sounds like the noise a fully worn brake pad makes.  BUT I already changed the front pads and right caliper.  I also bled the whole brake system.      The real interesting part is that it only makes the noise going forward and at slow speeds (I probably can't hear it at fast speeds due to road noise).  Finally, it still makes the noise coasting in neutral and is speed related (ie squeaks in relation to tire rotation).

What it takes to manage a company, how to manage it right, finances, etc. I'm currently a junior in high school and I'm thinking of majoring in Business in college.      However, my parents disagree because they feel that Business is something vague and that anybody can do it. They told me that any guy can go open up a business and make a lot of money, like a dry cleaner or a flower shop or something. They want me to be a doctor because a doctor has to study for many years and takes a lot of hard work, and that business doesn't really have anything special because you don't have to study like anatomical terms and stuff like that. But I'm talking about big business, not small stuff. Investing, real estate, managing a big company, etc.      What are your thoughts? Do you feel anyone can do it, or do you feel it requires special skills?

20070502152241AAVa8vM	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	I ask again - is it not possible to boycott one oil/gas company per month?	I got a couple of interesting responses - by the way jojo5050, I have a job, I'm a deacon in my church and I have 4 children. We have a minivan and s.u.v., - when I am in the market, will be replaced by more fuel efficient cars.  My oldest son, however, has his own vehicle which he drives to the train station and has had only two delays, and they were on his return home.      I am not saying we should all use public transportation exclusively.  I have a family and realize that would be imprudent and impractical.  I will rephrase myself and say that for those who can, whenever possible, use public transportation.  If your family size permits, get a smaller, fuel efficient vehicle.  Such actions would be our end of responsibility.      If we boycott a gas company per month, it will be felt.  Consider the fact that frachise fees will not be able to be paid. Yes,companies will wholesale out to others, but they have franchise stations who pay fees.      If I am mistaken, I accept logical answers.
20070113094326AAVVNgv	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Peugeot 106 washer problem?	Hi, I have a problem with the front and rear washers on my 2002 Peugeot 106. The washers do not work at all when the engine is running or with just the ignition turned on, the usual sound of the motor can not be heard either. The weird thing is that just after the engine is started if you are quick the washers will work fine until you release the stork and then they wont work again, well, occasionally they might but only about 1/100 times which isn’t good enough really. I’m guessing bad wiring, my dad thought it might be a blocked hose but as the sound of the motor can not be heard I don’t think that’s the case      Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated      James

I have a 1991 Buick Park Avenue, weird things been going on the tranny, when i first start it up and put it into gear sometimes it will take right off and sometimes it acts like it slips or something it just wont move, BUT if i was to put it into reverse or first gear first then put it back into drive it takes off perfect and i wont have ANY problems at all with it.  So to me it cant be a worn band i wouldnt think cuz it would just not work any of the time right?  I was wandering if there are sensors or solenoids that could be causing this.  IT never slips at any time after i move it initially.  And it will ALWAYS move if i put it into first gear or reverse first.    Thankyou

20070502161833AA9VD4m	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is it possible my car can still have an alignment problem after the alignment has been "fixed"?	First my car pulled to the right when I let go of the steering wheel. Going around 40 mph, it would practically change lanes for me, it was that bad. Then I got a flat tire (front right). After putting the spare on, the vehicle began pulling to the left. I bought a pair of new tires, and the vehicle still pulled to the left. I took the car to a local alignment place (highly recommended by a friend), and they said they fixed it, and charge me $45. Upon leaving, I noticed the vehicle still pulled to the left. So, I went back and told them this. They said they fixed it (again) and when I left it *still* pulled to the left.   Is it possible that there is something else messing with my alignment that an alignment place wouldn't check or fix? I don't know much about cars, but my front left shock (I think) might be damaged. The car sometimes makes a squeaky noise from the left front wheel area when I get out of my car. Could this have something to do with it? Please help!

Now the issue is, I want to buy a car from GM so I can keep my pmt. down and not worry about miles anymore, and I am even willing to "downgrade" to a less expensive car.  The dealerships are not willing to help me, they all are charging me MSRP according to what I have seen online. Then adding in the $2200 into that, making my payment outrageous.  How do I get them to stop giving me run around and help me?!  I'm getting so frusterated.  Last time I went to buy a car I went through this too and ended up finding one nice guy to help me after months of looking.  He doesn't work there anymore or I would just go back to him!

20090227054525AAqHmAB	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my car burning so much fuel?	Hey guys   I'm just wondering why my car is burning so much fuel, this is the information that i have.      About 2 weeks ago my check engine light came on. I checked the gas cap and that wasn't the problem. I bought a code reader, and the error codes were P01701 which is a System too Lean (Bank 1). I know this could be a contributing factor to the bad mileage but I hadn't seen a change since my last fill up (2 days ago at lunch).    I can usually go about 500-600 km on a tank of gas, and right now my odometer reads 150km and I'm almost at half a tank ("first half" being biggest).    My question is do you think the system too lean error could be a major factor in this? and what else could it be?   I'm almost sure I don't have a fuel leak   Any answers, recommendations or anything else would be extremely helpful      p.s it's a 1998 Honda Accord, and it's going into Honda on Monday for diagnostics.

20090304075804AAEqovh	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	How many altimeters feed into an autopilot system?	Just been reading the news about that plane crash at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on 25th February 2009.   Having designed safety critical systems myself (not avionics), I was staggered that something as fundamental as engine throttle would rely on a single source altimeter. I would be looking at putting three pitot-static instruments in and taking a consensus reading of the devices. Not only that, but they also use ground-radar altimetry and GPS altimetry on board aircraft as well. Any failure of consensus should result in a fail-safe, surely, i.e. do not adjust the controls.   Does anyone know if any aircraft use consensus readings?

I have my subs chained to my floor in my car. It's very obvious. I probably couldn't get them out myself. LOL      So..my question is: If you were to steal subs. If you saw that it was obvious that it would be alot of work, would you leave my car because of that?      Or should I spend the extra money to have the tint put back on? If I did that you could NOT see into my car.

20090304083643AA3RHDw	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	I want to learn how to ride a motorcycle (female)?	I have wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle almost all my life but my parents always talked about how dangerous it was/is. Obviously, I never learned.      A year ago I started dating a guy who has been riding motorcycle/dirtbike for 11 years. His whole family also rides motorcycles...yes, even his mom. Before his mom sold her old bike my boyfriend took me out to try and teach me how to ride but I had so much fear in me because of my parents. I fell off twice because I was nervous about the gas and the brakes...I stalled it.      What can I do? I'm going to take a course this summer but my fear of getting hurt/crashing scares me so much. So I have some questions I would like to ask anyone out there (WOMEN TOO) about learning how to ride.      How long does the fear last?   How long does it take to get comfortable riding?   What is the best bike I could get for someone my size (5'5)?   Is it hard to learn?   and   Anything I should know about/safety tips?      Thank you. I'm asking here instead of asking my boyfriend because I feel he's less likely to understand how scared I am. He'll just say, "you can do it, there is nothing to be afraid of" and that's not what I want to know.      :)

20090304080952AASM3kj	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2002 dodge neon check engine light on yes i have asked this question but did not put make of car?	Took the car to autozone and they said the check engine light was on because of a fuse.      So I took the car to the dodge dealership and wanted them to change the oil and transmission fluid, look at the brakes and see why the check engine light was on.      They said there was basically a short in the wiring.      They took it all apart and fixed the short and now they told me the car won't crank.      They said that right near the wheel where there was a dent when it wrecked there was a computer there, it was dangling and in pieces and that is why the car won't start.      I drove the car up there. It had no problem cranking whatsoever. It was driving really good.      They are now telling me to get the car running again that computer has to be replaced which is going to cost 1500.00 and then they will charge 900.00 to put it on....      Is it just me or does it sound like they put 2 wires together that wasn't supposed to be together when they were trying to fix the short and possibly blew the computer? Or is it even possible that the computer was hanging there in pieces but still running and driving just fine but decided not to run after they fixed the short?      I don't know what to do. I just bought the car and I don't have that kind of money to fix it for that much especially since I think they may be the one to blame. am i wrong?

When i start up my car it makes a knocking sound for about a minute and then it stops. and after that it won't do it anymore until i've let my car sit overnight. it has been cold overnights if that has anything to do with it. i have a Honda del Sol. and haven't done anything special to the engine. it all started when i went to Canada for vacation and it got really cold one night. Thanks

Well apparently they won't fit because of the bolt pattern. In fact the bolt pattern is rare so they only carry one rim that fits. Just wondering if there is a black rim out there that will fit the bolt pattern

20090304090454AAJpFwg	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is it a wise idea to mention a rebuilt transmission when selling your car?	I just seriously overpaid for a complete rebuilding of my 2002 dodge neon SE's automatic transmission. The torque converter,pump, drum kit, master kit, and solenoid body needed to be either replaced or rebuilt. The car has about 82k miles and doesn't have any other major problems. The work done will come with a 1 year/ 12k mile warranty.      If I were to sell this car, would it be a good idea to mention the completely rebuilt transmission or not say anything at all? It's nice to know that the transmission is rebuilt but it might trigger suspicion of other possible mechanical problems and lost confidence in the potential buyer, wouldn't it?   Lastly, if I were to mention the rebuilt transmission, what price amount range,if any, could I be able to add to the car's value.?   Thanks
