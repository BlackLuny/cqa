20090129040344AARNXEz	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	NEEDED: 2nd, 3rd, and even a 4th opinion.?	I have a mechanical/engineering question for all you engineering experts out there, that I would like a 2nd, 3rd, and even a 4th opinion on. This is a question about a knuckle press. Start with 2 ea, 24" long steel arms, brass bushings and pins on each end. One end is pined to a solid anchor. Two ends, one male, one female, are pined together to form a hinged (knuckle) joint. The last end is pined to a movable object (guided ram), and the whole system is then mounted in a vertical position. A hydraulic cylinder is attached to the hinged or knuckle joint in a horizontal (90 degree) position. When cylinder is fully retracted, the total length of the two arms, which when in a straight line is 4', is now reduced to 3'6", which causes the lower eye to raise the attached plate (or ram) a total of 6". Now the question(s). How many tons pressure is required to push on the side of the arms to obtain 150 tons downward pressure in only the last 1" of the downward travel. Remembering that there is absolutely no resistance in the fist 5". The last 1' is where the ram will come into contact with the piece to be pressed. At this stage the two arms should be straight in line, and hydraulic cylinder should be fully extended. 2nd question. How much stroke is required in the hydraulic cylinder to raise the ram the required 6", and still fully close the ram ?     WHEW!!!!

Then I realised that the sun is also moving, around the centre of the galaxy... Then I realised that the galaxy is also moving, etc.      I can't get clear in my head what shape is the path that the Earth is therefore making through space... It clearly can't be a circle or an ellipse...      Now I'm wondering if the Earth has ever been in the same place twice...      What's the answer???

My 5 and 4 year old share a room, and lately have been complaining about the lights flickering on and off. This never seems to happen when I am there. My boys have called me but as soon as I open the door it stops.   It can't be the electrics because the house was re-wired when we moved in and the trip is very sensitive, it may be the light bulb but that dosn't explain it happening only when Im not there.   You might wonder if the boys are lying but I can assure you they are not. Both are TERRIBLE liars who smile and giggle as they do, but last night my middle boy was frightend and almost in tears and told me to turn the light off so it wouldn't do it again.       Any ideas??

20061214074008AANDxk9	Science & Mathematics;Geography	Was timbuktu ever situated on the niger?	Today timbuktu is situated about 18 km from the Niger river. I found that the great explorer Ibn Battuta (1304-1368)  said that Timbuktu was 4 miles from what he believed was the upper flow of the nile. If this is correct than it could be that originally the town of Timbuktu was indeed founded on the banks of the river Niger and that the river through the centuries changed it course and left timbuktu in the desert. Then ofcourse the question would be: why hasn't timbuktu moved with the course of the river through time? after all most houses are built of mudbricks.   Can anyone shed some light on mysterious Tombouctou?

What is the component of the pine cone's impact velocity   (a) parallel to the ground   (b) perpendicular to the ground?      For (a) I'd like to say the velocity parallel to the ground would be 9.3/sin[22] =24.83 m/s      How can a component be larger of what it's a component of though?   So it can't be right.

20090128212252AAu80yR	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	What are some examples of pneumatic and hydraulic applications?	I am a field service electronic technician and am doing a number of interviews across the country right now in pursuit of a more stable position.  On a lot of the job descriptions for my upcoming interviews it says they would prefer someone with 'electrical, pneumatic and hydraulic experience'.      I have plenty of electrical experience, but have never really worked with pneumatic or hydraulic systems specifically before.  My current position has me working on electronics systems on tractors, so I know there are obviously hydraulic actuators on them and whatnot, but I really haven't worked with these much more than making sure they are set up correctly electrically.      My standard answer on an interview is to say that I have a theoretical understanding of how pneumatic and hydraulic systems work and have talked about the strategy behind using one or the other in school, but I'd like to be able to go a little further than that.  Are there common applications for pneumatic or hydraulic systems that I may come across in my normal day (outside of work, preferably) that I could cite having experience in using?      The examples I can think of are car brakes, and also I think a CNC lathe I worked with in a position had a hydraulic chuck, but that's about the only examples I can come up with off the top of my head.

20090129090513AAt3ye7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	The Conservation of Mechanical Energy Questions?	1) A gymnast is swinging on a high bar. The distance between his waist and the bar is 1.1 m, as the drawing shows. At the top of the swing his speed is momentarily zero. Ignoring friction and treating the gymnast as if all his mass is located at his waist, find his speed at the bottom of the swing.       2) The skateboarder in the drawing starts down the left side of the ramp with an initial speed of 5.4 m/s. If nonconservative forces, such as kinetic friction and air resistance, are negligible, what would be the height h of the highest point reached by the skateboarder on the right side of the ramp?       3)A particle, starting from point A in the drawing at a height h0 = 2.5 m, is projected down the curved runway. Upon leaving the runway at point B, the particle is traveling straight upward and reaches a height hf = 4.1 m above the floor before falling back down. Ignoring friction and air resistance, find the speed of the particle at point A.

20090128210528AA7yQMs	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Should I major in Mechanical Engineering or Architectural Studies?	So, I've been to college for electrical engineering, and it sucked.  Not that I wasn't passing, I just didn't really like it.  I like math and science and I'm good at both.  Its the electrical stuff I didn't like.  So I also have an interest in art and design.  Right now I'm in a huge dilemma.  Of course I realize I would probably make more money as a mechanical engineer, but for some reason, I feel like I would be much more eager to learn and willing to make the grades in Architectural studies. So in my mind I'm thinking, "major in mechanical engineering and I'll make some money or major in architectural studies and do what I would have more willingness to learn".  Another thing that pulls me towards engineering is the fact that I have 2 years worth of credits in electrical engineering, in which most of that is also in mechanical engineering.  Based on this description, give me your opinion or what you would do in this situation.

They're my favorite animal, and I would love to have a low-content wolf-dog someday, but I've noticed that a lot of people seem to really hate or fear them. I can't understand why, considering they're such intelligent, beautiful animals and are the direct ancestors to "man's best friend". This wolf video on YouTube is also one of my favorites:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SWz2Gf_...  I've also read that people stand more of a chance getting struck by lightning multiple times than getting attacked or bit by a healthy wild wolf. I know some people, under certain circumstances have, but even though it's very rare, people still feel a need to fear or hate them. I once read someone's website that called it "Little Red Riding Hood Syndrome". What could be some reasons why this poor animal is so misunderstood?

If I see a question here in the math section to which someone's already given an answer identical to (or better than) the one that I would give, I give them a thumbs up and move on.  If I do add my own two cents, I only do so if I have a clarifying remark or some additional insight to add to the discussion; in any case, I make it clear the which response I advocate so as to encourage the asker to select or the voters to vote for the person who supplied it.      Quite frankly, I think this is the obvious etiquette for this nook of the Y!A woods, especially since most of the questions asked here have flat-out right answers and, often, flat-out best ways of solving them.

20090129080934AAs9pBx	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Why do Black Holes have such a strong gravitational force?	Hey. This puzzels me deeply as my science encyclopedia doesn't explain it clearly. When a death of a star comes to pass and the creation of a black hole occurs why is there a massive change in gravitational attraction? Yes a star has a relativly impressive force of attraction but what caused the formed black hole to have such an attraction force that it is able to engulf and compress the atoms of light etc? Should the original star have the same gravitational force than it's later formed black hole?       Has this got something to do with escape velocity or more importantly the Law of Inverse Square(distance and mass)? Could it also have something to do with the curve of the spacetime fabric and the infinate density created? All comments are very much appreciated.

If it was found by SETI that a planet outside our Solar System was home to to intelligent extra-terrestrial life and valuable and unknown substances would earthlings wish to take control and conquer?

20090129074226AARvpHi	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Astronomy homework i need help plzzzz?	When discussing distances across the solar system, astronomers use a unit of length called the astronomical unit (AU), which is the average distance between the Earth and Sun:    1 AU = 1.5 x 108 km = 93 million miles    To talk about distances to the stars, astronomers have two different units of length. The light-year (ly) is the distance that light travels in on year:    1 ly = 9.46 x 1012 km = 63,240 AU    Physicists often measure interstellar distances in light-years, because the speed of light is one of nature's most important numbers.    Many astronomers prefer to use another unit of length, the parsec (pc), because its definition is closely related to the stellar parallax method of measuring distances to the stars. The distance at which 1 AU perpendicular to the observer's line of sight subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond, is defined as one parsec:    1 pc = 3.09 x 1013 km = 3.26 ly    From the Star SIRIUS at a distance of 2.64 parsecs it will take   years for light to trravel         From the star ARCTURUS travelling at 11.25 parsecs it will take   years for light to travel         From the star VEGA travelling at 7.76  parsecs it will take   years for light to travel         From the star BETELGEUSE travelling at 131 parsecs it will take   years for light to travel         From the star SPICA travelling at 80.4 parsecs it will take   years for light to travel     From the star ANTARES travelling at 185 parsecs it will take   years for light to travel

A weight will drop to ground level and the switch needs to get turn on once the weight hits or touches the switch and the motor needs to wind the weight back up but another switch needs to be able to turn the motor off once the weight is at the top. Maybe a relay of some sort? Something that stays open while the motor is running and then closes when the weight has reached the top? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
