I have an HDTV with built-in tuner.  I've heard that watching HDTV over an antenna can actually be a better picture, because they don't compress the signal like cable or satellite do.      Most of the major networks broadcast from a cluster of broadcast stations about 25 - 30 miles away.  If I have a portable indoor antenna, do you think I'll be able to pick up most of those stations?

Its rather inconvenient, so I was thinking of restoring my Ipod to its factory settings (or formatting it, whatever you want to call it).    Now, I know this will erase everything on my Ipod, but what will it do to my itunes songs? will it delete them too since the only way to format the ipod is through the itunes program?     If it doesnt delete everything on itunes, i can format the ipod, and resynch it with itunes and put all my songs right back on it within 5 minutes and eveything will be ok. but if it does delete the itunes songs...well, i dont feel like digging out my CD's again...

20090203161437AAn1jPM	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Which iPod is for me?	Hello everyone,      My previous iPod Nano (2nd gen) was stolen. Now I'm planning to get a new one. My budget is up to 200 dollars. I don't have too many songs (around 300, but constantly growing). I like the idea of putting some movies on my iPod since my older 2G couldn't do that.      Personally I think the Nano 8GB is the best choice for me. Should I go 16 GB? or a classic?   Which is best?      And if you have a suggestion that is not an iPod, please tell me, I'm wide open to all suggestions here, as long as they are backed up.      Thanks in advance.
20090203161624AAo2nfM	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Questions About IPOD I Just Got For Christmas?	I got my very first IPOD for Christmas.  Its an IPOD classic.  I love it!   But I have three questions.   Number one, I bought an episode of a TV show and had it on my IPOD.  I watched it one night, and then the next time I went to watch it again, it was gone from my IPOD.  Its still stored in the memory of my computer, but I can't get it back on my IPOD.  Why?  How can I get it back on?   Number 2, I've been using ITunes.  I've heard there are other sites that have cheaper (or free) downloadable music.  Any suggestions as to the best?  Reasons why would help.   My final question - my room mate wants to download all of my music onto his Blackberry, and my friend wants to download all of my music onto his I-Phone (I have over 2,000 songs so far stored on ITunes).  Is this possible?  Is it legal?  How do we do it if we can?   Thank you to all who answer!

20090203161406AA97Hlt	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Resident Evil 5 a huge disappointment? ?	Recently the Resident Evil 5 demo has been out on the PS Store. I have been one of those people who have downloaded and played it. And after playing it I was disappointed. This game, the one everyone waited for turns out bad? Here are the bad things:   1.Camera is terrible, It's hard to get around because of it.   2.Combat is slow because if you aim you can't even move.   3.AI is stupid.   4.When you equip something else the game keeps on going which means enemies can still attack, and you have to find the ammo.   5.Online co-op feels just like the single player. I mean it's like you're with a computer AI. You don't even see the players name. And you know how many times I got ERROR when finding a match. I barely went into a match.      Just to let you know this is the first Resident Evil game I've played but I think we can agree that this is not that great. 3 of my friends agree it sucks.

20090304183700AACnEzo	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Help!! This is annoying...?	I recently purchased a Samsung Saga w/ Verizon. I downloaded the Mobile Email client (Publisher: OZ Communications) from VZ apps and it was working with my Yahoo and Windows Live e-mail accounts and was later told by a Verizon rep that the program is not compatible with my phone. I fully removed the program; however, now everytime I receive an e-mail to either of those accounts I receive a text to my phone which reads: "OZ Mail CI=76155849AC4A29AEF542FD83DC29516 MC=1" As you can imagine, I am receiving this very useless text ALL DAY LONG. I can't reply to the text to stop them in any way.      Does anyone have a clue how to stop this?    P.S. I have already done a soft reset of my phone multiple times to no avail.

20090304194550AA7K09q	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Is there a way I can charge my mp3 player other than plugging it into my computer via USB?	 http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Sansa-Clip...       ^ That's the one I have. I'm specifically looking for any type of working wall-charger I can buy for it. The only computer (it's a desktop/family computer so I can't move it to my room) in my house is downstairs and my room is upstairs. I'm usually using the mp3 player throughout the day or I forget to charge it during the day which makes me have to charge it at night. I usually fall asleep before I remember to unplug it and I'm tired of getting scolded for leaving the computer on at night for my mp3 player charging. It only has two ports I can plug into it.. the USB cord port and headphone port, so I'm not sure if I can buy it's own charger. Any ideas are appreciated! Thanks.

I would understand if I was a trouble maker and my grades were bad, but I've been 16 for less than a month, and in that time, I applied for my first job and got hired, and am the youngest person to work there [chic fil a]. I got my driver's license , first try. And I'm keeping up a steady 4.0. I've provedr that I'm responsible and I truly do need a phone. Yet, my parents believe a cellphone is just expensive and a waste.       Since I have a steady job, I was wondering if it would be possible to buy a cellphone + plan without my parents. Even when I hand the money to them, they won't do it!  That's my best bet, to do it myself.      So can I just walk over to Best Buy and sign up for a phone all by myself?
