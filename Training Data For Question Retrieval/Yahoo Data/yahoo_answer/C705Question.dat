20090128210845AADrL1u	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Alcohol at the reception.. Your opinions please  ?	We've played around with the idea of having alcohol. Nothing big or like an open bar just a cocktail, or champagne, or spiked punch (it'd be CLEARLY marked). Problem.... I'm 20 (My family believes over 18 should be allowed to drink) and 3 of my maids are 20 or 19. For the most part they will be the only ones under 21 aside from maybe 5 friends I'll invite that will be under 21 and the 5-10 children that might be there. My husband to be is 25. I'm sure if I asked my friends they would be fine with respecting our wishes and drinking the sparkling white grape juice we'd provide for toasting for the children and guests who don't drink. If there was alcohol there I would take a sip to toast, probably no more because I'm not into drinking.      I want alcohol there because most receptions without don't last as long as those who do (I co-own a DJ business and it's always like there at the receptions and parties we've done) and we want to spend a lot of time there and truly celebrate with dancing and just spending time with our friends and family (who aside from my parents and his grandparents ALL live out of state) My fianc√© doesn't really drink anymore either so he wouldn't drink that much either, but agrees with having it there.      Thanks for your opinions
20090128210848AATA9qE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Complicated situation. Please help. What's the best possible way to sort this out?	When nothing goes your way and your completely pissed off, all you want to do is let out the rage you hold within yourself. I do it sometime by writing poems and ignoring. I had been trying to ask her how is she doing. But she is not responding. Well, we still love each other like hell even though we broke up long back more than 3 years back. She keeps on doing things like checking my profiles, checking our mailbox(we have created an account on yahoo long back which we share and it's meant only for us),giving blank calls from unknown numbers and several other things. We had been friends 2-3 times after that but we broke up as friends too as we fought. We've been single ever since we broke up. It's a very complicated story and even if God comes down and tell this to any one of us that we don't love each other, we are not believe Him. I do write her poems. She's a complete tomboy.We know at the end of the day we are going to get married since we really love each other. I do write her poems which she reads and loves. You can check them at my blog. The thing is she doesn't admit she still loves me though she really does. That's because at times I act a little desperate. So what should I do get her back and make her admit that she still loves me? I'm ignoring her currently. Do you think this would work? Since I've no other choice. She's not responding and this had worked in the past. The reason being, she starts missing me. But when I keep on texting her or contacting her, it's just me who misses her and I don't let her miss me because she feels am around her always. So shall I go for it or do you have a better suggestion or an idea? Am completely pissed off and missing her a lot. I love her to death and I know she loves me too.
20090128210825AApS89W	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do when your faced with this ?	Okay people i have something to ask,It's alittle odd but i wanna know others point of view     Okay my sis. came here last year during the winter time with her son. She was on hard times so i thought that i would help help her out. Being my little sis and all i never turn family away nor should anyone. Well my Bf and i  and his Bro. was sharing a house. i told them that i wanted to bring her up here to see if she could get her life back in order. They was okay with it. Mind you she was only 18.    Well long story short i only let my sis use my phone after 9pm. Now when i was not there My bf's brother let her use the phone even during the day. I told him NOT to let her use the phone cuz his phone was part of a family plan he had with his mom. and i did't want her to rack up a big phone bill for them,and the fact that she is 18 and i know how it is for teens and a phone. Now he  told me that it was his phone and he will let whom ever use it if he wants too. Okay i left it as that. time went by and we moved into our own house,My bf and i with my sis. His brother calls me one day and tells me that he has a $300.00 phone bill and his mom is not paying it. I Told him that i told him so and i would bring my sis by and they would have to find a way to fix it. Well in the mean time my bf  jumps in and pays is ,Saying his mom can't pay it and someone has to be the adult.....I said i told him and he didnt hear a word i said and said what he said to me so i feel that it's there problem not mine. so now hes all mad at me. I dont get it i did nothing wrong but said maybe this is a lesson that they both have to learn.....was she wrong .....Yes she was but i warned him and he did nothing but said its my  phone so am i in the wrong?

20090128214106AAnlP3p	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pretty detailed sex questions, please read?	The following questions are pretty graphic and personal, you don't have to read them but i would appreciate some serious answers to satisfy my raging curiosity, thanks.      So i have been friends with this girl for a while, and she has had sex lots of times with a couple different guys, but i have never had sex. Ive done everything except sex, like oral and what not. Ive been waiting to have sex with some one for a long time and now she wants to with me, and we have a complicated relationship and all but its nothing shallow what we're doing so don't worry about that part.   First of all, for the last few months i have been getting a lot of oral sex and i have been masturbating quite a bit more than i used to. I think it's because of this that when i am getting to the point of climax, i barely feel anything, my penis has lost a lot of its sensitivity and i was wondering if there was a way i could correct this as fast as possible, or whatever it takes.   Not only that, but even though i feel less of the sensation before ejaculating, i seem to finish a bit earlier than i would like. Any fixes for this as well?   And for lasting longer, and being harder, would it be better for me to not masturbate or anything like that during the time leading up to the day I'm going to have sex? Which is most likely in about 10 or 12 days.   Just want to make sure i last as long as possible, and perform best as possible.   Thanks a bunch, serious answers only please.   And go into as much detail as possible, and feel free to add anything that might be helpful or some little tips for the things i mentioned.   Thanks again.

20090128213243AAQCpmD	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents are so over-protective! help?	alright so my parents are INCREDIBLY over-protective. i can't even have my door shut for more than 10 minutes without them asking what i'm doing. the only way they let me have my door shut is if i'm getting dressed or singing.    im 14 years old, turning 15 in a few months. i need some privacy!   my parents dont even let me sleep with my door closed (i find it more secluded and i fall asleep faster) because they're "afraid of a fire". my mom even comes into my room in the middle of the night and checks on me. she has a problem that makes her go to the washroom a lot, so basically she gets up to go to the bathroom, then feels the need to come in and see how im sleeping?! i find it creepy and totally unnecessary.   my friends are having sleepovers every weekend- i've been to three sleepovers in my entire life. and the funny thing is- i went to a sleepover when i was about 10, then when i was 12, and 13. but now that im older, they wont let me.   i'm not allowed to go anywhere that includes boys, not even in a group to the movies or bowling or anything.    it's getting me so mad! i've considered running away.   what should i do?!
20090128213401AAi9aXB	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my dad ask why we never hang out, but then when we do he just gives me crap about my decisions?	My dad always comes into my room and asks me to go golfing, or go to the gym, or just hang out, because he feels like we don't spend enough time together.  The first couple times we hung out he gave me crap about everything I was doing. And he still asks to hang out. Why does he want to hang out if all he does is criticize?
20090128213118AAwurXk	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i just being paranoid?	okay. so i was molested by my grandfather for several years until i told someone.

20090128213453AAEf51T	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you call your grandparents?	I was wondering what different people call their grandparents. The usual grandma and grandpa are used way too much,[[at least in my opinion]]. I'm from new orleans louisiana and i'm creole. Not creole from haiti tho. Maybe more like mulatto. So i call my grandparents Mawmaw and Pawpaw [[pronounced muh-maw and puh-paw and the two syllables kind of run together quickly and the emphasis is on the second syllables]]. So i would like to know what you call your grandparents and the origin of those names. I would really like answers from people who have family that originate in other countries like countries in europe or africa or somewhere exotic. Thanks for your answers!!! =]

20090128214431AAAa3he	Family & Relationships;Family	Is she just a negative person?	i am staying with my cousin until i save up enough money to get an apartment and move. the thing is that lately she has been getting me very mad with the comments that she makes because i feel that she is just being negative towards my goals. For example. last year i got a very decent refund. so when January came around i was very excited for tax season because i know that i would be able to have the money to move. so i come home from work on day and say , ohhh taxes are coming that means apartment is near, she responds and says. well you better not tell anyone because it wont happen. then i joined weight watchers, and the gym and was really excited because i was finally doing something proactive for weight loss, so tell her that  i put a post it on my desk at work that says , if i lose X amount of weight by feb 27 i will reward myself with a meal at mcdonalds ( my fav)  so she says " oh now its not going to happen because you have that post it. so this week  they mailed out the w-2's so i asked the people at my job if they had received there w-2's and they told me yes , so i called her to ask if mine had arrived and she says no then follows with a sarcastic kind of  evil laugh and says " see i told u not to tell anyone now its not going to happen" so we got into a huge argument  because i am tired of these remarks , it as if ever goal i set she has something negative to say . today she comes up to me and tells me " you better be careful  i told my friend at work who works for h&r block part time how much you received as a refund last year and she said a single person is not suppossed to receive that much , so i would not be surprised if the irs comes looking for u " i was so mad , i did my taxes with a very respectable accountant , who had been doing taxes for 20 yrs.  its not like i received 10,000 back .   i mean is it just me or is she just negative?

20090128220354AA5zktL	Family & Relationships;Friends	How hard is it with a triangle friendship?	First off, I'm the kind of person who goes with the saying 'the more the merrier' kind. I like to hang out with a group of friends, and its always nice and fun.    What gets to me the most is when there's only three people, including me, and I sometimes feel left out. My two female friends are fashion and jewelry freaks. Whenever we go to the city, they always beg me to go to the clothing stores with them. I would shrug and say "sure, why not?" We go. Worse part is they spend there for hours, looking at clothes and jewelry. I really don't have the fashion sense, and I don't really care, but my legs and feet always hurt. By the end of the day, all I think of is that I just want to go home and not see them sometimes. I usually like hanging out with one or the other. If they're together, they'll talk about clothes. It makes me wonder if I should invite them out next time.    Worse case scenario, my other friend, Emily, is a very quiet person. Christina is my longest friend that I've known since middle school. When we're all together, its more like Emily and Christina instead of me and them together. We go to the movies sometimes, and they always sit next to each other. I sit on one end just being the listener instead of the talker.     Oh, they don't forget about me though. That's not what I'm trying to say. But, it does sound like I'm being alone though. Ha...    And, for my little birthday adventure in the city, I invited my other two friends, but I don't know if I should invite Emily and Christina (by the way, they're the fashion freaks). I hate for a whole day for just waiting on these two. I don't know what I should do.    And, maybe next time, should I just cancel their invitation and save myself from anymore suffering? In case if they want to go to something like an antique place or clothing place, should I just cancel? Or should I just go and have fun?    I like to know your experiences with friendship triangles please. And, any advice would be helpful as well.
20090128215700AAxcVW8	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i tell my friend that i don't want to be BFFs?	Ok so I'm a guy and I'm moved to a new school this year and i had a hard time making friends, but one person reached out to me (ill call her H)  and we started hanging out a lot and she was pretty much the only person i hung out with outside of school.  I got my license and a car in november, and where we go to school were allowed to go off campus for lunch and the two of us started going every day.  Lately we have had a third or fourth person come along, and i am starting to like one of the girls(we'll call her J)  but its a little hard because H just assumes shes invited and always rides in the front seat.      I would like to take J to lunch with just me and her, but i dont know how to tell H that.  I am also becoming friends with more guys and im really sick of chillin with girls all the time, and every once and a wile id like to hang with the guys at lunch.        One last problem is that people think H and I are a couple because were together so much, which makes girls who would otherwise be interested in me not really talk to me.       How do i tell H, who was the only person who went out of her way to help me when i was new to the school, that i want to be friends, but im not interested in being BFFs, and that i would like to be alone with J?

She's been through a lot,  from an arranged marriage, to living in a foreign country where she knows no one, to a divorce, to being a full-time working mom who spends all her money on her daughter (me) and my studies, "investing" in my future (for example if i study hard and learn a lot from my tutors, i can become successful and stuff), and moree..    her  1 wish is to buy a house, not a very big one, just a decent sized house where she and i can live before i go to college and get married. her other wish is for me to become successful and have a wonderful life, opposite from the one she has now.    she says i'm her only reason she's living to this day, the reason she wakes up early in the morning, goes to work, and comes back late, late at night. she's the most hard-working person i've ever seen. however, aside from making me food and taking care of me, i see sadness in my mom's eyes. she is so tired from working that she just sits in front of a TV all day when she's not working, for she's saving her energy for yet another week of work.. she reaaaaaaaaally loves me and i reaaaaaaaally love her. she's the best mom in the world and i'd die without her. i'm 13, by the way..     i just want my mom to be happy and get what she deserves - a house, the louis-vuitton bag she always wanted, my successful future with a great job, a husband i love, and many kids of my own, AND most importantly... her happiness.    because she works so much, she doesn't even have time to meet her friends, which deterred her from even making new ones. her social-life is bad (couldn't find the right term) and.. i just want her to MEET HER FRIENDS and HAVE FUN, even go CLUBBING or whatever i don't care! i want her to have a boyfriend and get drunk. i actually WANT her to. because she has no joy in her life except for me and like a mechanical robot just works her life away.     How can i make her happy?

I was as surprised to see her as she was to see me. After freezing for a moment, I closed the door and ran to my room still in shock of what I had seen. As i looked down at my boxers, I noticed I was pitching a bit of a tent and was aroused at the thought of my nude grandmother. I have only pleasured myself once to the thought of her naked since it has happened and I just wanted to know what other people think of this. Is it weird or I am just over reacting?   Thanks in advance for your responses

20090128215502AAPzkN6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend planning suicide over weekend?	There's this guy I know, and I kinda like him, but my friend dated him for a while and it ended badly between them, so on Friday he said he would kill himself over the weekend. I told him not to, and I'm really scared he will. He wrote marker all over his arms. He wrote "Cut here" with an arrow on his wrist, another thing that said "I'm going to hell" and before he left he told us he couldn't drown himself because his bathtub was broken so it was obvious he was thinking of ways already. I am so scared. I dated him for a really long time once and I don't want him to die just because my friend and him broke up. Please help!!!

20090128220439AAO6Fhd	Family & Relationships;Family	What is wrong with my mom? She doesn't treat me right.?	I'm 16 years old. I'm not the perfect daughter or anything, sure there are times where i talk back and give attitude, but my parents are something else. They treat me like i'm just as bad as those kids on crack. I have excellent grades and when i go out, I always ask and never come home later than what they ask of me. My mom is 38 btw.      Well, brace yourself guys, because this might be fairly long. & i'm really sorry for that. Let's just go to the basics. I used to be a cutter.   I never really had a strong relationship with my parents. So i never told them. One day my mom found out and she said that i need to get counseling. I refused because the main reason i cut was because of the way she made me feel.       I don't cut anymore, but whenever a problem comes up, my mom always brings it back to me not knowing what i'm talking about. Literally, she says, "You think you know everything, You think that i have issues, but look at you. No matter what i went through, i was never stupid enough to cut myself." I don't get it. Do normal moms tell their kids who used to cut that? I DON'T THINK SO! I tell her that it hurts me when  she says those things, but all she says is that I'm manipulative and stubborn.      Another time, we got into an argument and she said," I hate you. I can't wait till you're 18 so you can get the f*ck out of my house." With that she purposely knocked over my table and broke some of my things..       On my 15th birthday, she stormed into my room while i was sleeping. She asked me where her eyelash curler was and i told her that i didn't know. She got mad and said, " You want me to be ugly huh ? That's why you hid it from me!" Then she went to my vanity table and emptied everything and threw it on the floor. She said, "When i get home, this better be clean!"      I have a boyfriend. And when i go out, she always uses him against me. She says "you're going to get pregnant.blah blah. You were with your friends ? NO you weren't. You were out with your boyfriend doing god knows what" when i really was with my friends. I don't lie to my mom when i go out. i always tell her the truth. But she accuses me.       Then just a few minutes ago, she got home from her friend's house and started talking about her friend's problems. I was doing my homework and i told her that i was busy. Then she said,"I don't know why i talk to you! All you care about is yourself and your stupid boyfriend!" i don't understand how my boyfriend was tied into this whole thing, but she managed to connect it.      She also hits me when I say something against her. One time she kicked me and i left a bruise on my back.. She never listens to my side, she thinks she always right! It's so frustrating. And then she makes it seem like i'm the bad guy cause she'll tell my dad i was talking back and then he gets mad cause she starts crying. I don't get it. Someone please help me ? & no. I am not going to turn her into police or anything like that.         Don't get me wrong though. She doesn't drink or do drugs. She works and provides our family with a comfortable life. But she never listens. she always wants to be right and she'll never give way. She also manages to use my weakness and stab me where it hurts.. Do other mothers do this ? Cause if i was a mother, i'd never so any of these things to my daughter.

My best friend decided Saturday night that she is in love (Btw we are 15) with a guy that she has liked for 2 years and he also has a girlfriend. He likes her too, just not that much.   Well, she decided to tell him on Sunday that she loves him.   Me and this guy are friends and we go to martial arts together. Well, today, after class we were talking about my best friend when he asked me If I was with her on Saturday. I said yes, I was with her all weekend.    He goes so you were with her when she decided that she loved me? I didnt know that she had told him. I had to hear it from him.   I asked him when she told him and he said Sunday.   Now, I know this is lame, but I am pissed that she didnt tell me.   But that is only because yesterday we were talking about it, and she didnt tell me.    We tell eachother everything even the smallest things.    It shouldnt upset me. I am the one that said maybe she might love him,    I know how she flirts with guys and the way she flirts with this one is diffrent. Like she actually cares about him.      Do I have the right to be mad? Or should I drop it?   Should I say something about it or let her tell me on her own? (I was talking to the guy on MSN and told him not to tell her he told me)

20090128224915AAvK4jB	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm unhappy and underage, how can I call an adult and talk to them about it?	I just had a physical and emotional fight with my dad and my mom was dragged into it as well. I tried calling a police station to tell me if there was any therapist I could speak to but they didn't know of any.    I called a friend and made sure I let out the emotional stress.   It's 10:44 where I live, and I'm sure that no one will be awake to speak to me now, but I was wondering if there was any mature person I could call and talk about my problems to without having to pay?  (No I'm not asking for numbers of random people)    I'm just so depressed right now, I'll do anything to just have someone instruct me on what to do in a time like this.    It was a serious fight over a serious matter, that keeps worsening.  Please.  And thanks
20090128230759AANJzya	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I give up on a friend of mine?	I feel like I've been a great friend to this one girl. I've let her stay in my dorm room twice when she had nowhere else to go, I always help her out without so much as a second thought, I comforted her when a loved one of hers died a few months ago, and I've always done her little favors whenever she asked me. I did all these things because I figured that's what friends do.     Yet, lately we haven't talked as much and she seems different. We go weeks on end without talking and then I'll ask her to go to lunch or something. We'll have a good time at lunch but then weeks will go by again without any communication and the whole process repeats itself over and over.    I don't get it. Why would she do this? I feel like I've been a great friend and she doesn't put in any effort. I don't wanna lose her but I can't stand by and be taken for granted. What should I do?
20090128224133AALZWAg	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What is a courthouse wedding like?	Hi! My fiance and I have been considering having our wedding in a courthouse. We'll only be inviting around 40 - 45 people or less because our families are small and we want to invite some of our closest friends and not go all out because we believe that weddings are too commercialised and you don't need a lot of money to get married and have a good wedding and reception. We also can't justify spending so much money on one day when we can spend it on our new life together.    Anyway, we are thinking of having our wedding in a courthouse because it serves a dual purpose. One, because as well as devoting our lives to each other, we're lawyers and we're devoting our lives to law. We'll be having 40 - 45 guests, and there's not much point of having a whole chapel to ourselves.    I'd like to know of people's experiences, what it's been like, if you have got married in a courthouse, how much it costs, what sort of attire is suitable for a courthouse wedding and things like that. Thanks in advance.    Kelly
20090428161007AAsNIwN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does This Mean I Like Him?	I've always "liked" by my brother's friend, Anthony. He's 18, and I'm 16. Well, I felt like something could of clicked last September between us, but that's all. If you need me to explain I will, just ask. I think I saw him 1 time after that, and he was sitting on the couch working on his computer with my brother. Then today, I saw him, and I didn't know it was it who came into the house. After he was here for a while, I peeked around a corner, to see who it was, and it was him, and when I saw that, I quickly just moved back so they couldn't see me, and I felt like I was hit in the stomach. Like I stopped breathing for a second.      Does that mean I like him?      **all names have been changed**

Aunque en realidad solo quieren decir "ama a sus hijos" o "ama sus estudios", puede algo asi convertirse en adiccion? Y cuando algo se convierte teoricamente en adiccion, puede seguir siendo positivo para la persona o la gente a su alrededor?
20060713094927AAbp524	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Problems with the in-laws!!!! Help Please?	I have been married for almost 5 years and everytime I think I am making way with my mother in law, we run into some problem regarding one of my husbands ex's.

I am very hurt by this, I feel as though she is not execpting me as the wife. The ex I am talking about cheated on my husband a number of times and caused him to feel inscure and we ened up in counseling because of what she put him through it began to affect our marriage. Now my husband is upset with me and my mother in law is upset with us and I do not know what to do but this really hurts me?

20061023162834AAuiop4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My issue, or his?	Last night my boyfriend told me that I need to get a life, and some friends... because I'm crowding his space. Well, I work a full time job and go to school nights, is it to much to ask for him to spend time with me when I have the time to spend with him? I don't have friends because I don't have much time, and I would rather have no friends then be a bad friend to someone that doesn't deserve it. I love my boyfriend very much, but I'm completely heartbroken that he would say something so harsh to me! What is his deal, and what should I do? We have been together for 3 years, if he thinks I am crowding his space, why didn't he say something sooner? I've decided not to give him any of my time and see how he reacts, am I doing the right thing? Is this my issue of being so called "needy" or is this his problem?

20060825080843AAsL2gn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't my girlfriend wanna meet up with me more?	We're real close and we've been together for a month today, but we were best friends for 3 years beforehand. I love her more than anything and she makes me so happy, but I get the feeling she likes to make little (or no!) effort to ask me to meet up with her.      I feel like I want to see her at least two or three times a week (is that so much to ask?) but it's just not happening. It's the summer right now, so we should be meeting up a lot, and she has no other friends so there's no reason why she can't.      Every single time we've gone out, I've had to ask her. She's always happy to come out when I ask, but she has never (not even once) asked me. Sometimes she'll even just decide to go out with her mom or stay at home when I ask her to meet up. When she goes shopping, would it really hurt to ask me to come along now and again?      When I asked her about it, she said "I was gonna ask you out today, actually!" I feel as though she'll hate me if I try and discuss it all with her again.

Has he liked me all that time? If so what should I do? I really like him!!!

Ok so my ex and i somehow i ended up talking sex a few days back, then yesterday i msgd him asking ''will you be horny tonight?'', to which he didnt reply and then i again asked him that if you dont wanna talk just tell me, to which he again he didnt reply, then i called him to ask what is up with him and he said ''i have not paid my bill so i cant reply and i also dont feel like'' and hung up. i felt a little angry and msgd him "i was just looking to pass my time with you, and i have no interest in having sex with you, i already lost my virginity to a guy i like"      The next day he replies back ''go and have sex with your guy''      I said ''as if that bothers you''      He says ''why did u talk sex with me?go and have sex with your new guy''       I said ''i dont want to''      he said "its ok if you arent interested"      i said "intersted in what"      he said "f'ing"      i said"fiking who"      he said "your ex ....or who?"            He says ''tell me are you attracted to me?like me?have feelings for me? or just wanna talk sex?'''      I said 'i feel sexually close to you, that is all" and he gets angry and calls me names.      Can anyone tell me what is going on with him?

Is he just not interested in me anymore or does he still have feelings for me?

20090128224504AAneKi9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can i help a friend who is depressed and wants to leave?	so first i will give a little history of me and this guy who is now my best friend.   i was friends with him as a baby and we went to separate middle schools so we grew apart. i reconnected with him last year and we ended up in a romantic relationship. i really loved him and i'm sure he loved me. we were in love, i told him every aspect of my life and he told me every aspect of his life. something happened and we agreed (more me than him) that we would work better just as friends. that was the beginning of the school year. so in august, he told me he would never stop loving me but he would like it if we were friends. so we have been best friends that can always count on each other for the past months and now he has this idea that his life is terrible and he wants to go to England to boarding school and he thinks his life will be perfect there. i would be unbelievably upset if he left and i've let him know this many times. for the past few weeks i have been trying to get out of him his real reasons for trying to leave and he just says his life is terrible here and he isn't happy. he said there is a deeper reason than that but he didnt want to tell me until he leaves but i got it out of him last night. he said that he still loves me like he used too and he wishes i would love him back. i was unaware that he still loved me like that so this was a shock. we had an extremely long conversation and i was crying because it was so sad. we talked about how he thinks maybe he will get over me and be happier if he isnt with me every day. i feel guilty because if i could just love him back maybe he wouldnt leave. and also i feel guilty because if he is unhappy here i shouldn't want him to stay, i want him to be happy..thats all i care about and so i should support him wanting to go to england if that will make him happy right? i dont want him to leave though because i couldnt live without him!  what can i do??

20090225154047AAizZ4l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I screwed up everything with the boy I love, now I'm grounded?  Please help I'm desperate!?	So I'm in love with this guy, (we'll call him Canada) but he has hurt me emotionally in the past and I've never really gotten over it.  So a couple weeks ago he stops texting me for no reason, which he does a lot, and I tried calling him but he didn't answer so I decided to just wait and see when he would text me.  But on Valentine's Day I met this other guy (we'll call him Peru) who I now kind of like, I hadn't been that happy in a long time and I thought that I had finally moved on from Canada, but I was wrong...eventhough I kind of like Peru he is no match compared to my love for Canada, but somehow Canada found out about Peru and he was furious.  I was and still am confused, I didn't know whether to choose Peru who has never hurt me but I don't like him as much or to choose Canada who isn't very trustworthy and has hurt me many times but I still love him.  But because I sorta like Peru, Canada has now lost interest and won't talk to me anymore.  I don't know what to do, I was never going to leave Canada just because I like another guy and I told him that but he still thought that I was going to leave him so he just lost interest and doesn't even care anymore.  I'm heartbroken, so recently my mom found out about how sad I am because of this and instead of comforting me she grounded me and took my phone away and now I'm not allowed to even look at either of them!  Also, I'm no longer allowed to date or have a boyfriend at all because she doesn't trust me anymore and the only time she talks to me is when she is yelling at me to do something.  I'm so sad and confused, is it really that bad that I love a boy?  Why is she acting like this, I'm so hurt right now and I have no one to turn to for advice, especially now since I'm grounded and I can't get out of the house or call anyone to talk about it since my mom just yells at me... So now I've lost the boy I love and my mom's trust for no reason, what do I do?

I really think that if I could just get away from my parents for a little bit -maybe just a week or something- I could get a job and put my life together. I mean, I know that blaming your parents isn't helpful or anything, but they act in a way that i guess you could say is abusive, not that they're bad people, but it just makes my life kind of harder. Aren't there programs or something that can help me get away or help me get a job or help me move out? I know that it's kind of pathetic that i can't get out by myself, but I've tried before and I haven't been able to do it. I just need some help. Thanks

As the english representative from my class, last week I collected money from those who wanted to buy books.

I'm not going to tell how much I lost, but believe me, I am SO regretting my stupidity! >. <      How am I supposed to explain that I lost the money to my friends and teacher? I'd feel so embarrassed (serve me right, I know) and my teacher would never trust me again. I have savings only to cover 1/5 of the amount that I lost. What do I do?

20090128222935AAsqGCO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it rude to invite people to your wedding when you know they probably won't be able to come?	We are planning a wedding in Kansas City, but have friends and family all over the U.S.  Most people will have to either drive at least 4 hours or fly in to attend.     We understand that not everyone will be able to make it, but we want to send them an invite out of courtesy.  However, we also don't want them to feel obliged to send us a gift just because they were invited.   What's the etiquette on this?

Isn't an assembly line a little tacky now adays? I am a little clueless and any suggestions or personal experiences wil help.

20090225154037AA4ltMm	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I be concerned or I am overreacting?	Here's the deal...      Me and my fiance are getting married this October 2009 after dating for 4 1/2 years. I do not like his place of work. There are many girls there that are single and like to party. And it sort of rubs off on my fiance. He has a problem with flirting. He sees no problem with it, and thinks I am overreacting. There is this one girl he works with who is infamous. Especially through a trusted family member.  But I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Well the short version is basically she gave him a book to read about intimate relationships. A book I happen to have and that he would never in his life read. They both claim that it was just to borrow for us to read. But I thought this out of line on her part. She is not a close friend of his and no friend of mine. After this, a family member confided in me about this girl, and I got upset. I told my fiance my concerns in confidence. And what does he do... tells the girl everything I said. Causes this whole circle of drama. And then lies to my face about telling her. Then he admitted it and said he felt like it was her right to know. He was not sorry and did not feel like he did wrong. He took her side over mine and my family's. And he's tight with my family. He eventually apologized and said he was wrong. Ever since that time (which was this December 2008), he has been constantly hiding things from me. And when I confront him, he gets defensive, we fight... and then doesn't come home after work. Doesn't call, nothing. Oh and clears out our bank account. And keeps choosing these friends he has only known for months over me. THROUGH ALL OF THIS, he claims he loves me with all of his heart and wants to marry me and on top of everything, start a family with me. BUT he is willing to give it all up whenever I confront him, and he doesn't like it. He NEVER used to be like this. We were best friends and happy and loving and perfect for each other. I mean there were fights, but nothing we couldn't get through. He said in response to that, this is the real me, this is how I am. I told him I would endure this phase he is going through because I love him so deeply. Maybe that was a mistake? I feel heartbroken most of the time. And what really gets me is after we make up after an argument about these situations... he really makes me believe that he knows what he did was wrong and is willing to change and do anything to make it work. And we'll be awesome, on top of the world for a good while... until he slips up and I find something out that he has been deliberately hiding from me. And I feel so betrayed and used. Like he acts like nothing and the whole time he is sitting on something that would break my heart. The most recent fight was today. He recently joined a Shufflebowl league at a bar (despite us trying to save money for our wedding). For three weeks, he has been hiding the fact that that particular girl happens to be on his team. How am I supposed to feel? I'm crushed. I confronted him about it... he says he's sorry for hiding it from me, he knew it would make me upset, but if I knew she was on it, I wouldn't let him be on the team. He says he should be able to have whatever friends he wants. Girls, guys. I disagree. If we are married and have kids, I know he wouldn't be happy if I was spending time with a man. He got extremely jealous when we were first dating of guys I was friends with... angry, didn't trust me. So out of respect for him (because I was head over heels)... I chose him. And he chose me over his best friends, EASY. Friends of 14 years! Now he says that was a mistake on his part and he shouldn't have been so upset with me with having guy friends. And now he is choosing some co-workers over me. And he says if I can't trust him, we shouldn't be together! I'm crushed. How can he say this? We have a wedding booked and paid for.       So my question is... should I be concerned? Am I overreacting? Is this like a quarter life crisis or phase that I have to ride out? Is he just not ready to be married? He says he doesn't understand why we can't go out and have a family.... what! I like to do my share of partying, but once I have a baby, that behavior will be slim to none until the kids are older. I don't think a good Mom is dropping off the kids to the grandparents so I can get plastered. And he keeps saying he wants a baby right away! I don't know. I'm sorry for this being so long, but I am desperate. Please help :o( I don't know how much longer I can take this.

20090225154244AA83jzo	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend seems to treat me differently from everyone else...what to do...?	One of my best friends acts so happy around all my other friends when we're all together. She talks a lot, and she laughs and everything. Usually, when we're in class, we would always talk and joke around every time we get the chance. But at the moment, she goes completely silent when we're together in class. When I talk to her, she makes a simple reply. And she adds no enthusiasm or anything whatsoever. She just sounds like she‚Äôs unhappy that I'm talking to her...but when another friend talks to her, she gets enthusiastic again. And so I get annoyed and frustrated. An example is that before we were to leave for dismissal, I was trying to start a conversation, but she would reply with simple answers, and not joke around like usual. Soon the bell rung, so we all go up and left. But when we passed our other friends, she then sounded a little enthusiastic and replied to them with emotion.       This has been going on for about three days now. And she only acts like this towards me, out of all of our friends. She acts happy around everyone else, but with me, shes just so quiet and everything. And with her emotionless answers, I‚Äôm getting pretty offended. >__> Be aware that we are best friends. We‚Äôre so close, that we‚Äôre pretty much sisters. I know nothing is bothering her, since she still acts happy around everyone else, and I usually know when something is bothering her, but I don‚Äôt see any reason in why she would treat me so differently all of a sudden, especially since we didn‚Äôt even have a fight. Heck, we never had a fight. So now I don‚Äôt know what to do. >__> I want to ask her, but then I would feel guilty‚Ä¶I feel like I would sound selfish. What should I do?
20090225155423AA1aeQo	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think my friend is being a copycat to me.?	I am getting really annoyed with my friend now, It started off really simple but now its just everything I do, she is doing.      It started off as Music, I said I love visual Kei and Jrock and she said she loved it      I baught a guitar she said she wanted one and she baught one,       I am saying I want a bass now and she says she wants one,       I have a drumset she wants one.   And it doesnt stop at insterments and music      She told me she will never start waring makeup, so I ware a LOT of eye liner and she starts      I buy a shirt and outfit she buys the same one, I got to homeschool she wants to go to homeschool      I really dont want to sound like a ***** but I really dont like it anymore, and what ever I say to her like "Yea SID is my favorite group, Mao's eyes are so cute!" She will go to her online contact and say that to them and say that I copyed it from her,   Once my friend from my old school came over, and my 'copycat'' friend came down and started talking like she new all about visual kei and all that when she was just saying what I talk about, And when my friend went home my 'copycat' friend stayed and when I talked to her online, my friend took her e-mail and now I think she is saying stuff about me on it,      Im sorry its so long and I sounds bitchy but I just cant handle it anymore, Im on the verge of braking the friendship (note: I tried talking to her about it, it didnt work)

20090128230147AANLEse	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I have a fatal flaw?	I am 32, on my 4th really serious relationship in my life.  I have lived with 2 others before, now I live with my third.  The first two didn't work out, well they just weren't supposed to.  This one I thought would take, but I am jumping out of my skin being in his house.  I moved an hour and a half away from my hometown, which I know doesn't sound like much, but I grew up my whole life there, my whole family is there, and I miss it.  I don't know anyone here except for him and his family.  Don't get me wrong, his sister in law is awesome, and I have met some others through him that are good people.  Whenever we go out he knows everyone and I am left standing alone.  He introduces me to everyone, but I am a bit shy and he is Mr. Outgoing, so he expects me to join in the conversations.  I do my best, but I always end up feeling very out of place.  I haven't had any luck finding a job here, well because I really don't want to go back to waiting tables, but with the economy the way it is I have to.  My last restaurant was a place I was at for 8 years, everyone was like family to me, and now it is very strange walking into a whole new enviorment.  So, I pretty much get jobs, go to them for a few days, and make up some lame excuse like "I didn't like the manager".  I know why I am putting this off, I don't think this is going to work, so why should I start a new job here?  I don't care about anything, I sleep all day, stay up all night, I am eating the whole house and drinking and taking too many pills.  I am stuck I feel like and can't get myself up.  I just don't know how to pull myself out of this and put yet another relationship under my belt.  I don't want to keep doing this, I want a family.  I feel like I am letting everything slip away.

The main thing thats gunna make this difficult is that were both kinda in the same situation where we haven't really dated much and only had like 1 bf/gf before so from what I could tell were both gunna be kinda nervous so its gunna be hard to be myself around her when it will be just as hard for her

20090128231641AAZbMVx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I have her father's permission (yes!). Now, what ring?	Hi there. I have my girlfriend's father's permission, but now I'm not sure what type of ring I should get her.      Her ring size is a 6.5, but I'm not sure what diamond cut would look good on her finger. Her fingers are fairly skinny, and not too long if that helps. Whenever she goes into a jewellery store, she always looks at princess cut diamonds or solitaires, but I really don't want to buy her something that looks too big, or way too small. She also doesn't like white gold or silver with diamonds. She has told me that she wouldn't care whether it was a cheap $2 ring - it's the meaning behind the ring, but I don't want to get something tacky.      Does anyone have any advice on carats, cuts and if possible, some links to those types of cuts. Thanks.
20090128231735AAcWxQL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Going crazy emotionally?	okay to make this clear im serious enough that i'm afraid i may hurt and/ or kill myself if i do not solve this problem. no jokes people.      i have just quit a job that was too stressful for me to do while also attending college and now i cant afford my tuition or my bills. eventually i will run out of my savings. now this part is easy for me to solve. just be patient and find a new job and be more diligent working.       but since i was little all i really know is work. i wasn't given much chance to choose things for myself so my social status was crushed. i have really good friends i admit but when it comes to relationships i dwindle like a stick. i know playas, pimps, chill guys, hot girls, etc.... but it feels like i cant get another girl. like i wont have the chance to ever share in that. help

20090128233132AA3yTCD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding opinion please?	Hello! Sorry it's so long!      So this is probably a weird question, but me and my bf are going to las vegas next month and were considering getting married there. The thing is, i have always wanted my wedding to be a huge thing. We were thinking about getting married legally in vegas (no ceremony beyond what is legally required) and then having a wedding later. We would just tell people we are "engaged" (we arent currently) and tell them our wedding is the later date we decide. (Our parents would know though hah since i have to get off their insurance of course) For example i would wear an engagement ring after the legal ceremony and the wedding band after the wedding. The main reasons to get married sooner is that 1.we feel we are ready 2.i will be moving into his house soon after that date and he would just feel better about it being married (i dont really care about this but he grew up more religious than me) 3. he could get medical and dental through my work for $15 a month and he has NONE right now and i dont like it and 4.religious reasons...we'd just be better off married. I would not change my name or anything until after the wedding, we would just do all the other legal stuff now. The thing is, i feel weird about it- it sounds like an ok idea to me but if people find out we did that would they feel cheated, like we just had that later wedding to get attention and presents? Would they hate us for saying we were just engaged and it is technically a lie? Is this idea just ridiculous? Do you think the wedding day would not be special since we had a certificate already? i just need outside opinions on what you'd think if this happened. I also like the idea of eloping while still getting a wedding like i've always dreamed of.

What kinds of strange things do you and your family hear coming from your neighbors house,did you think that they might be Satan worshipers because of certain kinds of clothes that they wear or because they display Satan symbols out side their house or only come out during the night,   we never fully know who are neighbors are,my family's neighbors could be vampires or witches or satan worshipers.   but my old neighbors moved away because they didn't like my family and we would always hear them having conflicts and I would sometimes try and spy in their house(I was much younger then,a kid)

20090129014519AAICv5E	Family & Relationships;Family	A little about teenage mothers..?	I am so tired of hearing rude comments about teen mothers. Yes we are young, yes we don't have the full knowledge and education that adult women have, but i think before you say teenage mothers can't do this and take care of a child, remember we are ALL different. there are teenage mothers who have just drop their kids off with someone and don't handle their business, and that's them. Get to know some of the teenage moms and you might be surprised of how responsible now and how much they have learned because of their little one. I know I have, and my daughter is well taken care of by me and daddy and nobody else.   Stop judging because of what society tells you and you might be surprised.   Thanks.
20090128233030AATNpG0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being a shallow guy or am I making the right decision?	I usually consider myself to be a really deep and spiritual person. But there's this very flirtatious girl at my job that's been continuing to chase after me even though I only play it "cool" and flirt back. Also, she's five years older, has a daughter, and recently broke up with her boyfriend. Unfortunately, being my stupid self, I let her take advantage of me one night, and now she thinks we have a chance of being boyfriend/girlfriend. In all honesty, I AM not interested in w her, she drinks all the time, flirts with other guys as well, and is too sexually promiscuous with me.  Yet, for some reason she claims to want to make it work out despite the age difference, and I hinted to her that I would make a bad boyfriend because I'm always either working, doing college homework, and don't want to risk ruining my future by getting into the same things she does (mainly smoking and drinking).      Am i being too shallow, or am i making the right decision? Either way I don't want to be with her at all, so can you also help me figure out a way to tell her that I do not want to ever have a romantic or even physical relationship.
20090129000641AACYJkB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really miss this girl I used to work with, how can I get over her and learn from my experience?	We're in our late teens. Her a senior in highschool, me a freshman in college. This is what I honestly thought of her:      I loved the way her eyes would get all small and chinky whenever she'dgrin. I loved the way her imperfect, yet beautiful teeth looked when she smiled. I loved the unique way her hair looked  when she thought she was having a bad hair day. I loved how so damn cute her laugh was compared to every girl I knew before her. I loved the sensation I felt whenever I would touch her soft hand. I loved the way her legs moved when she walked around the store. I love that she knew what she wanted in life even though it may not be the most prestigious thing.      Unfortunately, I always place women on a pedestal, and as a result I started turning her off when she got to know the real me, and one day she just literally dissapeared. I deleted her number from my phone the next day, and a picture she took of our legs together..As you can tell I idolized her, and still do. But now it's really getting to me, I STILL dream about her and think about what could've been whenever I'm on the bus or about to go to sleep. With previous girls, they either rejected me or I found something I didn't like in them, but with this one, there was no complication, she got fired and I never knew if she still liked me or not. How can I just get over her and stop being such a wuss when it comes to being emotionally involved with women?

20090128233455AAqpUQ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I approach this girl?	So there is this girl in my engineering class.       Anyway I want to try and be friends with her. If it leads to an actual relationship then that's fine but I'm just looking to be friends right now or to at least know her.   I complimented her on her vest last class it really looked good on her. She said "thanks" and smiled. She has the best smile I have ever seen. That was the first time I ever talked to her. I couldn't get a chance to talk to her more because it was a lab and we can't really waste time.      So how can I approach her with out creeping her out because I think I already did? At least that's what my friends told me.

20090129003620AA1i8nS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if a guy likes you, or is just being nice?	There's this guy I have a crush on.. He opens doors for me [made me attracted to him in the first place], sits by me when he can. walks really slow when he passes by lol, stares at me, pays attention to whatever I say--even though it's about boring school work. Sounds like he likes me, right?    BUT wait, there's more!  He's nice to EVERYONE. He's the most un-shallow person there is, and he's really, really good looking. I would say he's hot, but he's too good for that word. lol. I could never tell whether he likes me, or is just being nice for the sake of his personality.    Does he like me or what?  I already have a huge crush on another guy, so if this guy doesn't like me i'd like to know asap.

20090129004510AAvf9ZE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married almost 3 years and Husband acts like he hates me!?	My husband and I have been married for 2 1/2 years and the last 9 months or so he moved me an hour and a half away from everyone I know and like to be around.   I recently started some self employment trying to help with the past debts and such and between this and the move it seems as though he has gotten more distant.   If he does talk to me, I am only cussed at and or screamed at and the last night, he slapped me for screaming back. (Last night, I gave him a black eye.) He has never hit me before or anything physical. As you can see, the fights have turned physical. I am usually the one being physical.   Today, all he could say was "I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry." He took my van with my kids' carseats and left and he hasn't come back. No one we know has seen him, I've called all the bars, and he shut his cell phone off. It's almost 3 o'clock in the morning and i still can't get him on his cell, but I've stopped calling other people.   Do you think that this is it? What should I do? That was my only vehicle with all the carseats (I have 3 little kids). He's the one with the black eye, I have no marks. The van is in only his name. My self employment is all that I have and its not enough to support my family yet. What do I do?      If you do not have any honest advice... do not answer.

20090129022119AAadGiw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you like me (be honest) ?	So, I feel that I'm not that pretty. I would not call myself pretty. No one, besides family, church members, and my best friends, have ever called me pretty.    I'm chubby, I have acne, and am diabetic. But, I'm only 14. I have a bit of a larger chest area than any of my friends. I was rated once, on a scale of 1 to 10 by a guy friend, and he gave me a.....6 1/4. Interesting, right?   Now, here's my personality:   I love reading, making art, cleaning (what a surprise), and talking to people, like getting to know them. I enjoy comedy a lot and have a pretty good and positive personality.      So, what do you think of me, and be honest. I am open to criticism, so be not afraid. Do you think anyone would like me? Like, relationship wise?      Thanks so much!

20090129021409AAUDuoZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like a total idiot that this happened..?	Yesterday I was visiting my friend at her place,   we were laughing and joking around playing cards and eating hot dogs.Unfortunately I didn't   see her bite into her hot dog,I did one weird voice for her that always make her laugh,then she   started to choke on her hot dog.I had her to try to   cough it up on her own,however she didn't cough   it up so I told her that I would help her.I went   behind her to preform abdominal thrusts,instead   she managed to indicate she wanted chest thrusts instead.(she tapped her chest) I asked if    she wanted chest thrusts she nodded yes,so I did the chest thrusts on her and saved her life.   After she recovered she thanked me for saving   her.After that I got quiet and didn't say much.I told her I felt like an idiot for making her choke,   she told me not to worry that she was fine,and    that she had a doctor's appointment the next day.   she phoned me and said there was no injury to her breast bone.Even though she forgave me for making her choke and is grateful that I saved   her life then why do I still feel like an idiot? She   still wants me to my voice impressions for her,now I don't know if I should I'm confused and   scared it will happen again to her.Please help.
20090129011733AAKmDuo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get over feeling like this?	My boyfriend and I have been going out for a year and a half.  He just broke up with me.  I kinda knew it was coming and I don't really feel bad that it ended, but I feel bad about how it ended.  We were SO close and I told him EVERYTHING.  I really thought we were gonna be together forever.  All of a sudden he just sent me an e-mail saying that he loved me, he wasn't mad, and that he had to break up with me because he was tired of hurting me.  I tried to phone him so I could say goodbye but no one in his house would answer the phone, and I know they were all home.  So that made me feel like crap.  And he had a best friend that was a girl, and she apparently didn't like me and I didn't think he was very impressed with the way that she acted so he stopped talking to her.  But the day after he broke up with me he started talking to her again.  I just feel like I didn't know him at all, and that he lied to me.  My problem right now is that I feel wierd, cause he was my first boyfriend.  We never actually had sex, but we did some stuff that's just making me feel gross and stupid now.  Is it okay that I got that close to him?  I feel like I should have known better, he was kind of a momma's boy and I ended up comforting him more then he ever did for me.  The only reason that I got as "friendly" with him as I did was because I really thought it was gonna last, that we could work anything out.  Now I just feel dirty and stupid, how do I stop feeling like this?  I'd talk to my mom or my best friend but I don't want to tell my mom some of the stuff we did, and my best friend is a guy (I think he has kind of a crush on me too...), so I can't tell them, and I don't have any girl friends that I'm close enough to.  Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!

20090129014406AAzPP10	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Can I Tell If This 17 Yr Old Guy Like Me (I'm 20)?	I met him in november 08. Well we've had sex 4 times. The 3rd time we had sex I wouldn't drive him home afterwards and the next time I text him he told me to leave him alone. Well the 4th time we had sex I lured him out the house by saying I had some weed, but in the end my friend and I bought coke and weed from him (she did coke not me). This time though he kept saying no to us having sex, but eventually he gave in.      He told me before that he knows I'm a ho and that I pick up random guys and have sex with them because my ex called one time when he and I were together & my friend played his voice message to me outloud. He's really confusing me.       If he told me to leave him alone then why is he still meeting up with me? Why is he trying to hold sex back? Oh I'm a female BTW.

My boyfriend of three months never speaks to me when he goes to his apartment home and whenever i ask him why? he gives me very vague answers.He have baby boy who is 3 years old with his ex according to him.I asked him many times if he have feelings for the lady but he always tells me no i dont love her and she is my ex so stop asking me that questions again. He switchs his mobile phone off whenever he steps to his house and the reason is unknown to me but my sixth sense tells me that he might be with that woman and he is having me on the sideline (that is just my gut feeling and nothing sure).

20090129010143AAiKL1S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl I met, then found on myspace: Should I contact her?	Here's the story.  Snowed really bad here in Seattle a month ago.  On the bus to work, this cute girl sat next to me.  Made some small talk about the snowy situation (city in chaos, bus extra crowded and taking forever, us having to go to work regardless).  Said bye and got off at my stop.      Fast-forward 3 weeks or so, and I see her at the restaurant that I work at.  I stop by her table and say hi, ask for her name, which I didn't get the time before, and talk for a minute.  There was definitely chemistry, but I felt hesitant to press it further and ask her for her number because I was at work and it's a little unprofessional.  I caught her looking around the restaurant as she was leaving and I immediately regretted not doing so.      I asked one of my co-workers if I should try to look her up on myspace to get a hold of her.  She said no, that it would be a little stalker-ish.  (strangely enough, she said to go online and look at her profile but not to contact her, which sounds more like stalking to me)      So this was about two weeks ago, and tonight, while sitting around bored, I searched for her on myspace, and surprisingly found her immediately.  Kind of amazing considering there's probably 500+ girls with her name in my city.      Should I try getting a hold of her?

20090128204206AAN5aHQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was my boyfriend being sissy?	My boyfriend's parents, especially his father works VERY hard to raise his family up. He really appreciates his father's efforts.   The other day, we were just chilling at my place and we happened to talk about his father. He said his father's feet are all hard and cracked, literally, because he works 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. He told me that he choked as he was applying vaseline on his father's feet. And as he was saying that, tears started to pour down on his eyes. All I could do was to give him a big hug.      I've dated him for three years and it was the very first time I've seen him crying. He was never a little crying baby type. He is rather a silly and outgoing guy who loves to make people laugh with his goofy joke.      He cried probably because he cares his father a lot, and may also feels sorry at the same time. I think that's so nice of him. Many 20 years old guys nowadays don't give a rat's @ss about their parents, you know. It's also a good to know that he isn't afraid to show his true emotion to me.      My girl friends, on the other hand, think it's a sissy thing for a guy to cry.   What's your opinion?
20090129021300AAhStJT	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding invite mess. Need opinions?	I'm 40, getting married for the first time. (yay!) I'm the wild child that no one thought would ever get hitched. My friends are thrilled.    But...      I invited a couple that I've been friends with for 20 years. It's always been hard to catch up with these two because they're always "SO busy". I figured my wedding would be an important event. They declined, saying, "Sorry, that date's no good for us."       Hurt, I e-mailed them and asked, just out of curiosity, what they had planned that day. (thinking that there could be a logical excuse like a prepaid trip or something) They wrote back, totally miffed and appalled that I could even ASK such a question. (and still gave no reason why)    They asked me, "Why do you have to make this about YOU, and not think we may have other plans on your wedding day?"      Needless to say, I'm hurt. I thought the most important day of my life would be worth attending by someone I've known for half my life.       What do you think? Am I being selfish about this, or are they just blowing me off?

Sex question?	i've never hooked up before. this guy i've known for a few months asked me to hook up and i said yes only because it's getting pretty pathetic that i never even kissed a guy! (yes, i'm ready for it) he asked me if he could feel me up and i said "maybe". i like when a guy touches me but if he grabs my chest or @$$ i might regret it. i want him to feel me up because im curious. do i make out with him as he feels me up or do i just awkwardly stand there?   Also, if he does grab at my chest, i don't feel like there's anything to grab! im a B cup...   (and yes, im not 13 or 15 years old, so i pretty sure im old enough to know the consequences)

I love him, but I dont think our relationship will be longterm. But what happened is: My camera went missing when he came over. And he has never stolen from me in the past, but im still worried. Because my old boyfriend stole my ipod. i got it back (eventually) but we immediately broke up. so im worried that my current boyfriend did the same thing. what should i do?? And should I stay with him? He lives across town, plus i just started a new school, and there are a few boys that caught my eye ;D

No female has ever been interested in me... which is disappointing to say the least...      I suppose I shouldn't care or should I? Is this my problem, or is it society that deems Middle Eastern cab drivers with useless degrees unattractive... aw hell... thinking about that makes me feel like crap... I mean it brings the image of a smelly old cab driver with a beard... which isn't true because I don't have a beard... and I don't think I'm smelly... I'm young and full of life and funny stories... that was irrelevant... but I just had a few beers so...      Let me hear from you... wiseman and wiseguy answers are both welcome
20090129005300AAtYKkC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I need to get divorce?	I am an Indian and Hindhu. Do I need to get divorce if I want to marry another girl as there is no proof for our marriage. My wife is living seperately and I never cheated on her and abused her in anyway. I tried my best to save our marriage. But it seems she is not interested.  I know she is happy without me & I love her so much, so I don't want to disturb her. She only put the word divorce in our relationship and I begged her not to do that. But she told she doesn't have any feelings towards me.

I think i feel the same way, but after talking to friends and other people, all the signs point to no, i shouldn't get back with her. She lies, she flirts with other boys, and yet tells me that she likes me. I even had the audacity to ask her whether she wanted to get back together with me, and she replied yes. however, at the same time, i get this text from some guy, and he tells me that shes flirting with him. I ask her about it, and she says its nothing, its "natural" for her and she can't help it. This has happened for some time, yet for some reason i still like her. I know i shouldnt, and i was so confident that i was over her...but apparently im not. I want to get back with her..but i know i shouldnt...what do i do?!

20090128235556AAUuNGz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, Does this kind of thing work?	So, I found a girl that I like. I'm a Freshman in college, and she's a senior at my old high school. We still live in the same city and everything. She was in this play at the school. Kind of lame, maybe. But I was active in my school's theatre department, which is more or less how we met.      Anyway. She asked me to bring her flowers because she knew I was going to see the play; more specifically I was going to see the play because she was in it. I got a seat right up front, and at one point I caught her eye while she was onstage, and I smiled, and she blushed a little. And it was magical. We continue talking, and spending a little time together. We texted like mad-men. But, when I asked her out (somewhat reluctantly, but whenever I reported her activity to any of my friends, they told me that she was 100% into me.) and she shot me down.      You know that "one special thing" that really makes or breaks your chances with a person? Well, apparently I didn't have it for her. But we still want to hang out, because we're both kinda smart and poetic, and we make good friends.      So, my question is kinda this: If I sit it out in the "Friend-zone" (You do not need to tell me, I already know that once you are in the friend zone, there is no escape to my knowledge. ) and just stay with her for a while, is there any chance that she'll warm up to me more? Or is she trying to spare my feelings by using the "you don't have that special something" line?      Note: I'm not suggesting that I focus solely on her and forsake all other girls that I'm interested in. As of now, there's no one else I'm interested in. I guess I have kinda high standards or something....

First of all im 17 and a virgin... i was good friends with a girl who i know is not a virgin and we slowly got closer and closer until i got the courage to ask her out.       Ive found out that she has had a ton of relationships and her longest one was only about 2 weeks long... Ive only had 2 relationships both lasting about 7 months +      I have decided that i really like this girl and want to keep her as my girlfriend but i just have a feeling that she is not going to want to be my girlfriend for too long... I really really like her and think she might be the girl for me       We have been dating for only about 4 days and i feel that she is not very close to me... she gives me hugs and held my hand once when we sat next to each other but im usually just the one trying to get closer to her      What im really asking is im pretty much a complete amateur at this and was hoping someone could help me out with this by just giving some friendly advice... im really shy and bad at dating so any advice would help. Thanks in advance!
20090128233253AA7Dy70	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does This Scorpio Guy Like Me?	I am so confused right now.      I met this Scorpio man in the bar I work at. I was immediately drawn to him. We had converstion but nothing in depth. I later saw him sitting alone looking unhappy. I asked him if all was  ok and he unloaded his problems on me which were pretty intense. We exchanged numbers and he said he'd be in with friends. Next night he's in and acting shy. Caught him looking at me. My shift ends and I sit with him. I am exhausted and not my usually animated self. I tell him I just want to rest my head on his shoulder and he says that is ok go ahead. We kiss good night at closing and go our ways. He wanted me to hang out but.... I had a boyfriend who I was done with but was still living with until he found a place. Since I work in a bar I sometimes drink si my ex was coming to get me. The Scorpio knew of my situation and that I was really done with it.      Over the next couple weeks plans are made to get together a couple of times but nothing happens. I decided he was a flake and gave up. Then he starts pursuing me relentlessly. We finally get together about three weeks later. We're hanging out and talking and he starts talking about his woes again. He even cried in front of me. We had a great time. Lots of laughing and even finishing each other's sentences. Things got out of hand and we hooked up. Really hooked up. Shouldn't have but it happened. Spent the night together. Had plans with my child the next day. He wanted to come but I said no. I have to protect my child.      The following night I am down in the dumps and he calls me asking me to come out. I reluctantly said ok. I had the most fun I have had in years. I spend the night again but left in the morning feeling silly. I hate doing the "walk of shame" and haven't since college. He sends a message saying he had a really good time and hoped I did too. I said I did but felt kind of bad.       After that I didn't hear from him for a couple days. I asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said he was busy. He really was but I took things wrong and didn't contact him the rest of the day. He sent me a message ten hours later saying he was sad. I called to see what was up and we talked a few minutes he had to go but called me back and sounded better.       Then everything just stopped. No calls. No messages. Nothing. He'd respond if I messaged him. I was having a hard time and he was a shoulder to cry on so to speak. I am the one to initiate contact now but he always responds. If I imply that I am done with it. He sends something to hint that I shouldn't be.      I am so confused. He had expressed concern over getting hurt due to the ex factor. I don't know whether he is waiting to see if that is reallt done or if he has lost interest. Thanks in advance for any insight and I apologize that this is so long.

20090128233758AAqpVir	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Freeze up every time!!?	I recently went on a date with an incredible girl, it may very well have been the best date of my life, yet when i dropped her off, i didn't kiss her goodnight, it was our first date so i know its not that big of a deal, but this is a seemingly re-occurring thing with me, i sit there next to her (another awkward part i didn't want to just be smooching her all uncomfortable in my car) and though she looked amazing i didn't find myself with the innate desire to kiss her, i know she (and other girls i've had this issue with) want to, but to me its just happenstance. Why do i freeze up like this? What am i waiting for? Is not kissing her going to be a turn off even after such a great night? its like i don't want to mess it up or embarrass myself, i don't know. please please please chime in with advice

I recently got into an argument with my 3 best friends (all of them against me) i know, pathetic :(        and now i have NO ONE 2 hang out with @ lunch. i have other friends, but it would be awkward 2 hang out with them because they are all in other groups and i dont know their other friends. any advice??      thanks in advance!!!  :D         p.s. actually i do kinda hang out with this one group but its obvious some of the people are like "why are u suddenly hanging out with us? go away!"       im a mess
20090128235932AA0T84V	Family & Relationships;Friends	IS SHE A TRUE FRIEND, OR NOT?	I have this one friend who is REALLY popular. We have been friends for 3 years now. Whenever I pass her @ school, she acts like I'm not there. After school, she calls me every hour and tells me secrets that I know she doesn't tell anyone else. It's annoying because I think she's just using me as someone 2 help her relax. Sometimes I ignore her phone calls because I hate talking 2 her.    any advice? thanks in advance :D
20090128235519AAedIiN	Family & Relationships;Friends	I FEEL LEFT OUT AROUND MY FRIENDS?	Ok, so last year I only had like 5 friends at my hebrew school. Actually, they weren't really my FRIENDS, just people i knew well enough that I can talk 2 them at the hebrew school.           There's this one girl who is my ENEMY and is really bitchy to me. The problem is, she's friends with the people I talk 2 there.           There is only 2 classes. After the first day of THIS YEAR, i told my mom "I DONT HAVE ANY FRIENDS IN MY CLASS!!!" (they arrange the people in the classes by which class and days they went last year) and so my mom told me how she called the office and requested 4 me 2 not be in the same class as my enemy.                      I was soooo mad that she did that without asking my permission. Because of that, I feel VERY left out around my friends and barely talk 2 them and i NEVER see them.                      My mom said that she could put me in the other class, but I don't want anyone 2 ask "why did u switch?"      and i wouldnt be able 2 say that my current class has 2 many people, because we have less people than the other class         any advice? thanks in advance!!  :D

20090128235030AAmK2ld	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I not let the things my Boyfriend says affect me negatively?	We have been going out for 2 years, he is my best friend. Lately, we have been clashing like crazy! I've been telling myself it happens to all couples around this time in a relationship because you see more of what the other person is like and you are more likely to get annoyed easier (duh). Anyways... my question is my boyfriend told me tonight over the phone that everything ive been doing has been annoying him. He said that it was probablly because he never tells me that hes annoyed and that its just all adding up. I cant help feeling like im doing everything wrong if hes getting so annoyed at me. We worked it out, we are DEFINATLY staying together, but my question is, how do I not take things like that personally? I want to be able to hear his complaints about me and not feel like I'm a horrible person and I'm letting him down blah blah blah. The funny thing is... I think I'm doing it to myself and I'm not sure why! He never puts me down, he'll just tell me when something I do annoys him. I'm tired of feeling like I'm a failure and letting it get to my self esteem. Because I feel so bad about myself I get meaner to him and more defense and very nasty. I don't want to be like that anymore! HELP! How can I fix my mindset to look at it differently?!
20090128235918AAL0gaH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend doesn't want me hanging out with his sister!?	When my boy heard me n his older (22 yr old) sister talking about hanging out, he said "I don't want you hanging out with her" I was like "uhhh okayy" and asked him later that night on the phone why. He said its because she has alot of problems he doesnt want me to deal with or find out about. He said he was trying to protect me, and he sounded very sincere and serious. He sounded very sad and like hes been burdened with whatevers going on for a while. It made me sad but at the same time me n his sis already kinda made plans to go out to dinner next week and idk what to do now! Do I make up a lie not to go out with her, or tell my boyfriend its too late now and it will only be this one time?!      I'm confused! I've been going out with him for 2 years and this would be the FIRST time me n her have hung out!

20090129003321AAysea0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Come on. Click on it now?	This guy's a year older. And i really like him. So i was wondering if he feels the same way too.      One time in school, both my friend and i were standing at a corner talking when we both realise that he keeps walking past us. I decided to get a drink while my friend went off to find my other friends. When i turned around after buying my drink, i saw him standing nearby and he'll keep looking away when i look at him.      Another time, we happened to be at the same stall, so my friends knew what was going on and decided to "help". my friends were calling my name. So i decided to face the back and pretended i was talking to another friend as i was really embarrassed. My friends then told me he was looking at me the whole time even after they stopped calling my name.      I once talked bout some stars which i think are really cute. He started criticising them saying that they were ugly and those stuff.    He also asked me who i liked. He even decided to ask my friends bout it.      Once, i was online and was waiting for him to talk to me first. I soon got impatient and started talking to him first. He replied really fast and had lots of things to say.

20090129005904AAN3VRC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's going on?i feel so confused.?	My friend knew i was single and told me she had the perfect girl for me so she set me up with one of her friends on a blind date.   We all went to dinner and a club afterwords,i ended up spending the whole night talking with the girl,dancing and holding hands/making out(i don't usually get so close to people i don't know) and everything seemed to be going pretty well,we both ended up trading numbers and discussed plans for our next meeting.   Everything seemed great and all our friends said we seemed to make a love connection and at the end of the night she told me to call her,well we've traded a few texts and voice mails but now every time i leave a message for her she never even calls back.   Now i'm left wondering if i should just forget about her or what?.   friends have said she likes me and i realize she may be busy so i don't want to bother her and i certainly don't want to call her over and over.   is that just her way of saying she's not interested???.
20090129012309AAIDgNH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls just blow me off!?	so in the past few months i've made a few good connections with girls i thought would be cool to hang out with.   I don't usually ask just anybody for their numbers but with those few girls i decided to put myself out there and just go for it,each and every time they gave me their number and said call them.   Whenever i call i get voice mails or if i get them they say they'll call back and never do,i've left messages/sent texts with no responses.   why do girls give you their numbers and never get back to you?   if you're not interested why give a person your number?   is it girls just can't say that they're not interested?

In basics, the girl I like at the moment appears to have taken alot of interest in me, her friends tell me she really likes me & that I should ask her out and such.   I talked with her over it a little bit but she said she was torn between me and her ex. (4 weeks ago)      4 weeks later, she shows more affection to me and tells me that she needs to forget her ****head of an ex boyfriend as he keeps coming back to her and hurting her feelings. Although now she wants to do (sexual) stuff with me, but hasn't really admitted many feelings towards me even though I have towards her, aswell as this, I noticed she was questioned about 'getting back a past relationship' and she said yes..      I can more or less tell where this is going, I just wanted some advice on what to do or say to her next :/

20090129021655AA5zVBe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's literally begging. How can I say no?	My boyfriend and I recently broke up. We were very happy, but he moved across the country to a different state and the distance was just too much of an issue.    At first, I agreed to transfer to a school in his state (since I have the means to do so, he does not), but after being accepted, I went to visit (yeah, kind of backward) and absolutely hated my experience. So, we were left at a stalemate for a while, and I finally decided to stay put, so we ended things.    But it's been a week or so and tonight he called and asked me how he can make things work, why can't we be together, etc. It was really heartbreaking and I didn't know what to say, so I told him I'd think about it and let him know soon.    Basically, the only options I have are to go to a school I hate in a state where I know almost no one but be with the person I love. Or stay where I am and try to move on.    I really love him, I'm just scared. So many things could go wrong. I've always promised myself that I would never go somewhere or do something I didn't want to do because of a guy, but it's so different once you're actually in the situation.    Any advice would be helpful, thanks.

20090129022937AAf45SA	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you tell someone you love them?	I was sat there talking to one of my best friends a couple of months ago and she told me she loved me.      I‚Äôm hoping she meant it in a friends/motherly way. I think she did, she‚Äôs quite alot older than me, about 35 years. We have a mother/daughter relationship‚Ä¶ anyway that‚Äôs not the point. The thing was, I couldn‚Äôt say it back. We seem to have become very close very quickly and it frightened me. Shes a very intense person. But now, I feel like I can trust her enough to say it back. Only problem is I don‚Äôt know how too!?! I‚Äôve never said it and meant it before.      I think shes become wary of me, due to me not saying it back and rejection is her biggest fear. I‚Äôm scared that she doesn‚Äôt feel like that anymore and if I say it, she‚Äôll reject me (We are VERY similar in some ways). She‚Äôs very low at the moment, her husband has just filed for divorce and she feels very rejected. I think if I tell her how much I care and that I love her too, then she will stop pushing me away.      She needs to know that she isn‚Äôt alone and she IS worthy. I want to help build her self esteem up, by pointing out all the good things people say.      Oh and I‚Äôm her lodger too, I rent a room off her. So we spend alot of time together.      I just think saying it back will take out this barrier from between us and I wouldn‚Äôt be saying it purely for this reason. I mean it!!!! I just needed time to adjust to it.      What do you think I should do?
20090129024519AADwqIU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the secret of being smart?	I'm just curious
20090129024526AArXGaa	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	The worst nightmare of the man I love?	the man I love is 64 years old and he is 23 years older than me. I am 39. he used to be extremely self assured and arrogant person when we met, believed that he had figured out life in its fullness and enjoyed the fruits of his "hard" work. he was married three times before me and believed that marriage is a union of the similar intellectuals, a team, like an enterprise, a company. when he met me he believed that the only purpose of my life could have been to follow him and his ways and being so assured  in that he did everything in his power to make that possible. he looked at me as a beautiful sensual sex obsessed young woman, not particularly bright or ambitious, with a terrible self-esteem. Whatever, we fell n love somehow with the obvious divine intervention since neither of us were allowed to see the other with our eyes opened. only in the process of running away from each other we were allowed to have a glimpse of our true personalities. It turned out that we were both deeply wrong. He appeared not so smart as I believed and I appeared not so stupid as he believed. His intention was to come to the bottom of my dreams with him to see what it was there or maybe to see how to make me happy to the ultimate.My intention was to compromise to the highest possible degree because I believed what would have been MY ideal scenario would have been impossible to have with HIM, considering his age, his job, his family, everything about him. So, my intention, I repeat was to cast away the "ideal" scenario of "happiness" because it was not a scenario of happiness with him and I loved him, I wanted POSSIBLE scenario with him, not an impossible dream, or possible reality that would destroy the person I love. So, in this process of discovering the bottom of my soul for the purpose of keeping me at all costs and giving me what I ultimately want, he forced himself into the depth of my soul completely disregarding the fact that a dream without him is not the same dream and that by doing this he is killing my love for him by force and without me having a say in it. No matter how much I tried to keep it real and POSSIBLE he went further and further obsessing deeper and deeper into problems that actually dont exist at all in reality. My belief now, after everything that I was exposed to, is that he was actually running away from me, but didnt want to say it to me (we were too deeply involved for him to just say - I cant go on like this, you are in this hell alone now, I am leaving, he is too much of a gentlemen for that) but he forced me into giving up on him. clishe, I know, that is why I said I didnt expect him to be this stupid. His worst nightmare is that he walks around with a woman 23 years younger than him, gorgeous and radiant of happiness for being with him and getting him finally, deemed by the most men in his environment either goddess from the other world or the incarnation of sensuality and womanhood in its dangerous form, having her constantly on his mind following her around from the grocery store to

20090128204047AArUw5q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in love, what do I do?	The whole relationship began three years ago, however we were never at the right place at the right time. Three years ago, we began flirting and talking more, however at that point I wasn't interested in a relationship. The next year, we continued to talk and flirt, and spoke of starting a relationship together. However, I ended up dating someone else, and then he did also. After my relationship ended, his ended a few months after. So last year we began to hangout. We would cuddle and kiss, but there was so much more than that. He was the most understanding guy in the world, and once he even said "if you want to wear sweatpants that's fine, as long as i'm spending time with you". But we connected on such a deep level, we would talk for hours, and every night we would talk until one of us fell asleep. However, since i'm such an idiot I decided to end it. I have no idea as to why, it was just I took it for granted and thought I could do better. But now I realize that i'm in love with him, and not the stupid little five year old love, the man I could imagine a future with this guy kind of love. But the problem is we barely talk anymore, only on occasion. What should I do?

20090128204905AAjC6mz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I turned down sex with a girl that I really like....( Girls, help? )?	For one, what the hell was I thinking?!?  I don't know why I did it, she was laying in bed naked and I was there and I just didn't want to have sex with her. It was our first time hanging out and I didn't feel as if I should have done it, I didn't want to degrade her or anything of the sort.. I was trying to be a gentleman. But now she's a little put off at the fact that I didn't capitalize on the deal, and I'm HATING myself for not hitting it. I mean, I hook up with girls I don't care about but I don't why I did this. I can't get her out of my head now and she's not really getting back to me when I try to talk to her. Girls, what would you think if this happened to you and the guy explained the situation to you? And should I just stop trying to talk to her anymore and simply give her space?
20090128205103AAQvrYw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DOES HE LIKE ME OR NOT SHORT???????	I ignored a guys request three times to hang out because I wasn't sure of his behavior, if it was genuine.      On my Aim Status a few days ago I put: "Empty sentiments -- Do I look stupid?"      The next day he puts on his status: "I will never forget you, I can't."      I know it's not about any other female because he said that to me directly a few weeks ago. We've been friends for around several months.      His last girlfriend he lasted four days with. They broke up because he tried to kiss me and I told him not to do that because of the obvious reasons. He phoned to tell me personally he broke up with her.      Now that I feel I am ready to draw closer to him, he seems a bit distant. What gives?      I tried calling him last night but he didn't answer.

20090128205216AAoUjQs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	From a previous Question?	Quick summary:  12 years together ending.  My fault.  Wife not responding after 2 1/2 months whether relationship's over or not.  Asked whether it's over or not, no response.  I've been advised to give an option of getting together one more time to talk.       I'm thinking about emailing her, texting her and leaving a voicemail of the following for my last communication:      I'll make it easy for you since you don't want to tell me for yourself.  If you would like to talk about things, then come to dinner at my place on Friday night.  I'll be cooking for you.  If you show up, we'll have a good conversation about how to deal with the issues we face.  If you don't, that will be your way of telling me, since you can't actually tell me, that you're done with me.  If your choice is not to show, I will do my best not to contact you again, other than for joint financial matters.  I hate that you refuse to talk to me after 12 years, you don't know how much that hurts me.  I really hope to see you for dinner.

20090128212558AAbpXDc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So, was I a bit too mean to my ex?	My fiance dumped me a few days ago. I have been really hurt by this, but I am more angry now. He started harassing me via email and text, saying I blew it with him basically, so in turn, I said out of anger, well your d*ck was small,you never made me feel good and may I recommended extenze. I sent this via email. He hasn't emailed too much back since that. So, from a guys point of view, did this hurt him even more? Did it hurt his ego at all? I felt he deserved it. We were engaged. We broke up over his spending habits. He did not like it that I "nagged" about him buying stuff he did not need when he did not have a job. So, he chose to leave me and not compromise. To be honest, was he bad in bed...NO. He was wonderful. But with the anger that he has given to me, I felt that he deserved it.

Now, I will do whatever it is I'm asked within my capabilities and beyond them if possible to any bride who asks me to be their bridesmaid; however, when I am a bride, I want bridesmaids, but all I want them to do is stand up on the altar with me.  I want them as bridesmaids because they are important people in my life.        Will it be strange if I tell them they have no responsibilities, just show up, be there, hold the bouquets, and accompany me?      Is that out of the ordinary?      Is it wrong/rude?      Are they supposed to have errands?      I just always envisioned asking people to be my bridesmaids as a way of saying "hey, thanks for being there my whole life, I'd really like you to be a special part of my wedding" not "look, I don't have time to do this so it's your responsibility."

I know this guy through my family from years ago, we were friends until two years ago, we were both in relationships, soon after that I had a car accident and my world fell around me (I was a dancer) I gradually started to gain lost of weight, I mean 70lb (35kg)      anyway he got in touch with me again and we have been talking again, and he wants to meet, he says he loves me, and I'm this huge girl with a scar on her face, I wasn't even slim to start with, I want to meet him, But I don't think rejection will help (since I'm recovering from depression caused by the accident) I told him what happened, told him I gained weight, he said he doesn't care, he saw (My face) on the cam as well, But then again the weight is not on my face, Please tell me what to do? I told him to give me till the end of March, he agreed, But it's frustrating, I hate myself for being so fat (288lb) and it's stopping me living.

20090128211116AAZiPrV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Which would make you feel worse in a relationship: abandonment or being smothered?	Which would make you feel worse: being abandoned in a relationship (your partner is less affectionate; friendly but subtly a bit more emotionally and physically distant; more interested and energetic in work/other relationships)      OR being smothered in a relationship (your partner is very affectionate and wants to spend alot time with you, is quite clingy, insecure and needy, need of attention and reassurance, easily jealous)?
20090128230641AASb3WP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I dont want to assume that he talked to her but..?	ok so I was talking to my friend online, and she used to date and sleep with him, well, I told her how he was being kind of mean through a text, and how I wanted to hang out with him alone for the night and talk to him about something I told him I wanted to the day before, without any friends coming over, but he had a friend with him, so that didnt happen, but we dropped his friend off and hes like so you had something you wanted to talk to me about the other day, I told him it was nothing and not to worry...But I kind of what to think that she said something to him, and he said he wasnt trying to be mean through the text...

20090128214011AAUjsZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think I am overreacting?	My bf and I have been together for about 3 years, and have lived together for just over a year. Lately we've been arguing quite a bit. (we've both been pretty stressed) Today was his day off and we always hang out, today he got invited to go play some games with some friends (which is fine) and all I asked was that he not stay out super late because we have been fighting a lot and I want to spend time together.    Well, I decided to be super sweet and get all dressed up (wink wink) for him to show him I'm sorry we've been fighting. I called and asked when he was going to be home..(its 1030 pm) and he said around MIDNIGHT. We always go to bed at midnight.    I know that he didn't know I had gotten dressed up, but I feel like he should have called or something.   Am I overreacting?   Thanks!

20090128230642AAE8b01	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my ex do this for me?	For my 21st birthday i invited my ex to a party i had at my cousins house, we've been broken up for more than 2 years and he has a gf. He brought his gf with him to my birthday but later dropped her off and came back. Prior to this, we just barely starting talking again after being broken up. I got drunk and the whole night i was really really mean to him. I told him "i dont even like you" "your not a friend" "go away!" i kept asking "what are you doing here". Basically I was MEAN, but yet he stayed and took care of me even though i had other people already taking care of me. He cleaned up after the party, he made sure i drank water, took me out to get some air, he held me in an intimate way as others described and helped me walk and basically took the initiative to take care of me. He even came to my house after to take care of me still until i unknowingly kicked him out because i started crying and told him that he hurt me. Why did he do this? He really could have just left. How much can an ex still care for you and just because he cares does that mean there's feelings involved to? That night/morning he kept texting my friend who was also watching me to make sure i was ok over and over again      2 days later he IMed me and told me everything that happened and i apologized for everything and he kept saying that i shouldnt be sorry. And then he said that I put a smile on his face that day. He admitted that he was scared to come because he was afraid my cousins would hurt him, but regardless he still came through.      thanks in advance

20090128225334AA1vsLo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you deal with this?	I found out today that somebody I really care for is moving. Well from 3rd party is who I heard it from. Where their moving to is pretty far away. I'm not taking this well at all. People have seen me cry today more then my whole life. I know I need to ask him straight out if it's true. I plan to the next time I see him. Which who knows when that will be because I don't see him as often because he's been keeping to himself lately. (not with just me, but with everyone) . I know people move, but he's more then just a friend and I didn't really know how much I cared about him til this was dropped on me today. How do you go about handling something like this?

20090128211502AADVjAl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please give me some ex boyfriend advice or some encouraging words, I am hurting pretty badly.?	Here is the deal. My ex boyfriend broke up with me back in August, and left for someone else after over 4 years together and being engaged. This girl he left me for is 27 years old and has two kids living on her own, he is 25 and still lives at home. I told him he was going to regret being with someone with two kids because he didn't even want his own, and isn't independent. Late December he told me he was having doubts about dating her because of the kids, and January 3rd, they broke up for about two days. He ran right to me and called me telling me they had broke up, and we hung out. Then he went back to her, and didn't even tell her we hung out. He still tells me he has doubts about the kids and is confused about her and I, and still misses things with us. I miss him too, although that is probably stupid. Four years is a long time, I cannot stop crying and remembering endless memories, he was my everything. I built my world around him. What does all of this mean, what do you think will happen? I am hurting so bad, I just want some advice and relief...

20090128210234AAGfmTz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you help me out please? What's the best possible way to sort this out?	When nothing goes your way and your completely pissed off, all you want to do is let out the rage you hold within yourself. I do it sometime by writing poems and ignoring. I had been trying to ask her how is she doing. But she is not responding. Well, we still love each other like hell even though we broke up long back more than 3 years back. She keeps on doing things like checking my profiles, checking our mailbox(we have created an account on yahoo long back which we share and it's meant only for us),giving blank calls from unknown numbers and several other things. We had been friends 2-3 times after that but we broke up as friends too as we fought. We've been single ever since we broke up. It's a very complicated story and even if God comes down and tell this to any one of us that we don't love each other, we are not believe Him. I do write her poems. She's a complete tomboy.We know at the end of the day we are going to get married since we really love each other. I do write her poems which she reads and loves. You can check them at my blog. The thing is she doesn't admit she still loves me though she really does. That's because at times I act a little desperate. So what should I do get her back and make her admit that she still loves me? I'm ignoring her currently. Do you think this would work? Since I've no other choice. She's not responding and this had worked in the past. The reason being, she starts missing me. But when I keep on texting her or contacting her, it's just me who misses her and I don't let her miss me because she feels am around her always. So shall I go for it or do you have a better suggestion or an idea? Am completely pissed off and missing her a lot. I love her to death and I know she loves me too.

I hear a lot about guys cheating on their wives for thrill and ego etc. etc. and what usually happens with their cheating partners after some time. But what if the situation were reversed and a single guy was cheating with a married woman would it be the same? Do guys feel the same way women do after awhile? (used) Or do you just roll with it as long as it suits you? Would it bother you that the husband does not know or would it be empowering? Ever been in this situation? What happened?
20090128211417AA4hN5y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help I could really use it?	This happened about a week ago   So Im 14 and I really like this guy, who is 16, and he is my best friends brother. I spent the night at her house the other day and we were playing capture the flag with a few of our friends and him, it is when you hide an object and the opposite team has to find that thing, and it gets a little rough some times. So I was guarding him trying to make it so my friend could run to the "winning spot" and I took him down and I was on top of him, btw we were playing in pitch dark, and he flipped me over, with his hand touching my bare skin under my shirt, and we just stayed like that until my friend came in screamin about how we won, what does this mean, does this mean he likes me, if so what should I do about it without hurting my friend?   does he like me? What could I do to take things farther along? should I have kissed him?
20090128231947AAeL7Qu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did he not ask me if it was true?	Me and my bf and his friend hung out on Sat. well my bf seemed not himself but every time I said I should go home, he was like no don't go. So when I did go home he texts me that he doesn't feel the same way about me. I said I didn't really understand and that I loved him, and he said he was sorry but he lost his feelings.       He never stoped text-ing me on Sunday, and I kept telling him why do you care. He wanted to know if I wanted stuff back that I gave him. I just said your a great guy but if were not going to be together then I want you to leave me alone, this is killing me and your ripping my heart to shreads.       By Monday he said he maybe made a mistake. He wanted me not to flirt or be with anyone, and I was like your a fool I'm in love you I only want you.      On Tuesday he says that he was a fool to let me go, and he was sorry.       Ok so I find out from his best friend that his best friend told him I kissed him (I punched him, and told him to never even look at me again).       So why did my Bf not even ask me if it were true? (totally not true)   Should I be mad at my bf too?

Please don't say its because the father is prolly a deadbeat, I understand in those cases the women should have full custody.

20090128220511AApSfMW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is two months too soon to say good-bye?	My best friend and boyfriend, who I dated for about a year, left for a two year mission. During this time, he cannot call me, txt me, and can only email once a week. He's been gone for about two months already, and, although I still miss him, I've been getting closer to another one of my guy friends. I've liked this guy friend for a while, and now, with Kyle, my boyfriend, so far away and with such little communication from him, I want to be with him.    Is it bad to dump Kyle after only two months of being gone? I mean, I know that when he comes back that I'll want to be with him, for sure, but I can't help but wonder what could happen in these two years. I don't want to crush Kyle, but I don't want to let time pass me by either. What do you think?
20090128210127AA7mTtN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i break up with him ?	So me and my boyfriend have been dating since august but we have known each other for about 3 years. In October his luekemia returned, we always knew it could so to us it wasn't a great big surprise. But since then its been really hard... we barely get to see each other because of his low blood counts and everything . So a couple of days ago i figured out that when he was able to have a vistor he didnt tell me about it and instead he invited hes ex girlfriend to see him instead and she has been going to visit him ever since he was able to start having more vistors. Im not sure what to do becasue i really dont know what they are doing but its just bugging the hell out of me that he didn't tell me about it until i found out myself and he didnt ask me to come instead of her. I'm not sure if this is jealousy or i should really break up with him. WHAT SHOULD I DO ?!?!?!
20090129023446AAguK1U	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	LADIES... How much does size matter?	I am married to an amazing woman who is like 20 times better looking then me.  But she loves me and thinks the world of me (and I don't know how I am so lucky!).  I know alot of guys out there get insecure about this, but I have wondered alot if size will eventually become an issue for her (as I am small in my opinion, she seems to be pleased with my size at this point though).  So, my question is, will being a smaller size have an impact on our relationship in the long term?  I'm guessing women prefer to be with well endowed men for the long haul.  What do you ladies think?

20090128231142AAeqHvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I better off with her because of this?	Okay so this girl and I like each other (alot I think but im not sure how much)... We've known each other over a year and just recently got together... she's known I've liked her for quite some time now. I know alot of people mention the "want what you cant have phenomenon", but she KNOWS that im basically wrapped around her finger. My question is this: Does the fact that she knows she has me when she wants me and that I like her a ton yet still is with me and close to me a really good sign? In other words, she knows she can have me, but that didn't make her lose interest in me.... so its not a "only want what you cant have type thing"... how well does this bode for our relationship/future?

20090128212949AAP5aUF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would it be a turnoff for women to date a guy that's a virgin?	Just wondering, I'm a 20 year old college guy.  I'm fairly good looking, 6'7" 240 lbs in great shape.  I've had my chances with drunk girls before but haven't been in a serious enough relationship to have sex yet.  I might wait until marriage, but if I'm with a girl that I'm in love with and she wanted to have sex I'd consider it.  So for women that have had sex before would you date somebody that didn't want to have sex until the relationship became very serious?  Or would it be a turnoff?

20090128212414AABpbsK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When you move on because someone is taking you for granted, why does that make them want you even more?	Wouldn't they see what was in front of them, and be smart enough to know you were going to leave?   Or, do was it that they kept pushing it to see how much they can get away with?   I have never understand this.   I treat men good when I have them, and never fail at keeping them. But its the other way around with the guys I date. They start acting up, thinking they have me where they want me. They take my kindness for granted, don't take me seriously and get a lil ego over me liking them so much. Slowly but surely I start talking to other guys, find a better man as a replacement and leave them. Even though I told them time and time again I was unhappy, they don't understand why it didn't work and why I moved on.

20090128205257AAyf5pS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help me see my kids again?	THE UK GOVERNMENT KILLED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN WITH OUT ANY REMORSE?   i am a US citizen. My ex wife is British citizen. I have two children. Several years ago, my ex wife's father passed away in the UK, and SHE WENT TO THE UK to mourn her father's death. She went back with my children with a return plane ticket for her and my children. My ex-wife stayed in the UK for over a year, and I thought she would come back to the USA. She did not and instead filed for divorce in the UK and got remarried. Her plan was to leave me for her boyfriend back in the UK when her father passed away because our marriage was an arranged marriage. I went through the USA children's affair and got legal representative . My ex wife would battle me with everything and she would do everything to prevent me from seeing my children. Las summer, the judge said there may be a possibility that the children can come to the United States to only visit, but my ex wife was adament against that. She got a cascaff involved in the case. The official UK male bashing organization against men. After battle the UK courts for 5 years, the UK judge rendered an order stating that I can never see my children again and I can not speak with them over the phone. He also said I can not appeal this decision. The basis of this decision is that the mother has manipulated my children to tell a UK CAFCASS social worker that they never want to see me again, and the judge complied with this. My son is 10 years old and my daughter is 7 years old. My ex wife married a fundamental muslim who is brainwashing my children, the UK courts just relinquished my of all human fundalmental rights as a father, and I feel my country the United States has betrayed me and has not done enough.      I pleas need help and I am in immense grieving pain. I feel as though the UK courts told me to think of my children as being dead because they wont let me call my children.       I never did anything to hurt my children and prior to this I had visited them several times through a court order and I was extra gentle and kind with my children , so this social report is fabricated with lies and deceit.      I need help from any American's that can help me bring back two American citizen children back home and unit them to there very sad father.      I am deeply hurting that I have not been able to get out of bed the last 48 hours. I am feeling really depressed , betrayed, hurt, and lied to. I do not know what to do and how can a judge do such a thing.      I m going to post this everyday until someone can help me...Ive called the media, an attorney, the district attorney's office, and left a message with my congress man. I am not giving up and I hope maybe someone reading this will give me good advice to get my children back      TO ALL WOMEN THAT HATE MEN OR SOMEHOW RELATE THIS STORY TO WHAT EVER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT PROMPTS YOU TO LEAVE VERY HURTFUL AND NEGATIVE POSTS....I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE NEVER TO TAKE AWAY MY CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER..MY INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN..I STILL STAND BY THIS... BUT THE EX WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AND WILL LIE AND DECIET ABOUT EVERYTHING...SHE IS TELLING MY CHILDREN THAT I AM NOT THE FATHER AND HER NEW HUSBAND IS THE FATHER....I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY...MY CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN TO MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER IS LOSING HIS SIGHT AND I JUST WANT HIS TO SEE HIS GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE HE LOSES HIS SIGHT...

My guy told me that he loves me on New Years Eve and had suggested that I should think about leaving a couple of things at his place the next time I stay over. He told me to think about it and I havent given him an answer yet.      Im having problems at home just now to the point that our family home may be repossessed. He noticed that I was feeling sad, asked me what was wrong so I confided in him. He told me that If I needed a place to stay, I could stay with him. Without giving it much thought I said no.      I would LOVE to move in with him but am a bit apprehensive as I dont want him to think that i've only told him about my situation so that he would offer. Is this something that he really wants or is it out of sympathy he's offered?      He's also invited me to go on holiday to Florida in May with his family, whom i've already met a couple of times. How do I go about telling him that I would have love move in if it wasnt for my current situation? Is he even wanting that? My head is all over the place and I dont know if im coming or going!

I've mostly been in serious longterm relationships with strong emotional connections. I'm very passionate and have a lot of love to give my gfs. I've mostly ended my past relationships Except my Last one which was kinda forced upon me. Sadly enough she was the one who I had the strongest attraction to, I never got tired of seeing her face and I loved her soo much. Now I feel so empty, numb, emotional, and then a lot of hurt inside, specially betrayed. Like Loving too much = Hurting so much. We broke up a while ago, but I'm still "scarred" by the situation.    I used to be optimistic about love, now i'm not. I've fallen in love 3-4 times, so love is fleeting. I'm so hurt by her that I find it really hard to trust women in general and feel like it's getting in my way of dating again. Like I see the big picture and ask "what's the point?" if I fall in love agian, only to be hurt again...So I'm just depressed and bitter, and don't know how to alleviate this.    And No I don't like 1 night stands or short term gf to ease my pain. I'm not motivated to date again. When I fall for someone I put all my eggs in 1 basket. But I don't know if I can do that anymore. How can I overcome these feelings so I can move On with my life  ?? It's effecting my outlook

Again whenever i ask him why is his mobile off he gives me very vague answers and i try to play the dumb so i just wanna see were this will lead to.He lied to me on numeruous occasions and i tell him yeah ok but i dont understand why would he act this shady with me.First day i met him,every word he told me about his personality is 100% different.He told me he is calm and honest,what i have seen for the last three months is loud and lying person. I love him unfortunately but dont see why i should ignore all the signs.What advice would you give me?      Im 26 years old and he is 35      I want some good advice and what do u think of the situation.
20090128232436AA2yec3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	TMI question, sexually experienced peole:?	Ok usually when me and my boyfriend have sex he'll orgasm pretty fast and then he's done and I'll have a little left to go. I ask him to go a little longer to make me orgasm because even though I can do it myself I love it when he does it. I don't mind him using his fingers because then its faster and stuff but he still won't and he'll be like "Do it yourself" and he'll get up and go do something else. Why can't he just take like 10 mins to do it for me? I really don't take that long at all..          Sorry for the too much info but I really needed to ask!       Thanks..

20090128212835AAPrXxc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS! how to fix my 4 yr on and off relationship w/ my boyfriend?	hello:    i need some advice on my 4 yr on and off relationship.    im 22, my boyfriend is 23. we are in college in the same city. we had decided to move into an apt together a couple months ago, but since i have been unhappy, i left today.    See, he is very sleepy all the time. he sleeps like 13 hrs sometimes and i really get pissed off when he does bc i feel like he could be spending some of that time taking me out, or spending a good time with me, even having sex? but no matter what he says or what i do, he sleeps in alllllll dayyyy long. sometimes even skipping class.   he also never gets motivated to intern or work for a law firm (he wants to be a lawyer) he says he isnt qualifed! but he wont try!   he rarely helped me clean up the apt. so i got really tired of being the only clean one around!   and he is not very in-tune with his hygine sometimes he skips showers. and he wears the same clothes three times in a row.   BUT when he is good and attentive to me, its really good. and its a great love.  he can make me feel so great sometimes. but he has a temper and he smokes a lot- im asmathic- but he just cant seem to quit longer than a day.   TODAY I just was really unhappy bc he didnt walk his dog - again- and he was yelling at me bc i woke him up at 11 am to remind him to get up! so he told me that if I stayed at my moms that I had to take all my things with me- isnt that disrespectful?   i just want to know if moving out will motivate him to try harder? he says he is the only one trying (just bc he made dinner last night).   what do you guys think i should do?

20090128224953AASPrVR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is counseling my only option left?	I am a 32 year old mother of a 9yr old girl and two stepdaughters 12 and 10. I love my girls and my husband whole-heartedly. The girls are all very intelligent and have their own beautiful personalities. I'm finding myself with a very short fuse here of lately however.  No violent outbursts, it just seems like my patience is running thin.  Even over little things with my 10 yr old stepdaughter.  In matters with her I find myself getting onto her frequently about the same things over and over with sharing with others,caring about others feelings, and mainly controlling her anger. Recently a 7 month pregnant family member of mine slipped on some ice on her front porch and hurt her back and my 10 yr old found it very amusing. It's always situations like these that I try to explain to her to have respect but she laughs until she gets into trouble.  My 10 yr old physically, verbally and emotionally harms the other two. I know that she is her own person but it always gets to me. A main problem is her biological mother. Basically she has no problems with me until we're no longer in contact. Many times when my name comes up at their house, the girls have to listen to screaming and cussing of things their mother do not like about me. I've tried family meetings to solve the fighting and disrespecting but their mother would get them home and repeatedly tell them "they are fighters not lovers" and encourage them fight who they want to.......any help is appreciated!

20090128211030AAOXzQO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you regain trust and can your hurt feelings go away?	I'd like to know whether it's common for feelings to get really, really hurt in a marriage, and whether people put up with lying.  Say that you know a person well enough to say you're pretty certain they'd never cheat on you (because they were cheated on before and never want to do that to someone else), but they lie about certain things that really bother you (pornography).  I was really hurt and told him that was enough, and he said he'd never do it again, but then he did.  This happened more than once, and it was pushed past a limit and then past another limit.  What if you feel like the person has hurt your feelings so much that you don't love them as much any more?  Is this common in a marriage, and can the love and trust ever be recovered?

20090129023402AAhdZTE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me with this boy? I don't know what to do!?	Ok. So there's this boy in my class, we're friends, and I really like him. At the end of term before Christmas I gave him a letter, it told him how I feel, asked him out and gave him my mobile number. I left before he opened it cause I'm really shy and I've never asked a boy out before.      Since the Christmas holidays we have been back at school for weeks, he is in a lot of my lessons and sits next to me in double Biology. Also in English he has sometimes come to sit by me when we've been allowed to sit where we want. But so far I have been to shy to say anything about the letter and he hasn't said anything either.      Do you think he thought I was joking? Or is he just too shy to tell me his answer? I mean he is really NOT a shy kinda guy. I don't know what to do!! I really want to know before Valentine's Day, I know it might sound kinda lame but I really want to know where he stands in time to get him the right thing, or nothing, or whatever. i know I should speak to him but I'm too shy! I mean I talk to him about other stuff but... I guess I'm kind of scared in case he says no or whatever.      Help?!

I mean during the actual act itself.      A certain female friend of mine is a virgin, and I want her first time to be something extra special. As best as it can possibly be. So my question to you ladies, is what is the best time to do the actual act? For instance:      Is it better if you lose it right as you orgasm? How about right before or right after? Is it better to get it over with quick, or take it slow? Etc Etc      I know that for most women, the first time is painful, and for her, I want it to be as amazing as it can possibly be. What advice would you give for this situation?

20090128230747AAOmC8a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I get a womans point of view?	I've known her for ages. Shes a good kind girl, friend of the family, Lately we got pretty close, went out few times, had a good time. It showed that she liked me (picked flower from ground gave it to me, affectionate..etc) so I was good to her, and I asked her out, she says she already has a boyfriend but haven't told her family because he's been divorced once and has kids but keeps on mimicking me like subtly copying what I say, copy what I do..etc.   She mailed me recently and ends it with see you next time.      If she wanted my attention she had it when I asked her, but why tell me she has a boyfriend and keep doing it?
20090128210255AA8P4Mv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's going on (guys help)?	Ok so long story.....I'm making it a bit short. A  friend from high school and I hooked up, he didn't call me after this so I just figured it was a one time thing..... Even though he kinda in a way confessed a major crush on me from high school and all and seemed very serious about starting something new. Now he called me and asked me to hangout about a month from the first hook up... He questioned why I never called and I simply said guys usually call me and if they don't I just kinda move on.... he said I should have called him but kinda in a rude way! Like he was appalled I didn't call him. He wants to hangout but just at his house.  I suggested we get coffee, but he never answered yes or no. Does he just want to hook up? Or does he want more?  I am kind of confused I hate feeling like a "booty call" if that is what this is.  My guy friends told met to let him go, but I actually want to hangout and see how it would go if we were more than friends.

I really dont know why, but she does. She hurt me horribly, and I still do want to be friends with her, but I dont know why she keeps doing this.      So why would she keeping coming in and out of my life at random moments, and what is she trying to say, if she is trying to say something?
20090128222516AAPOYyC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me, or just more comfortable round me?	So there is this guy, and I have liked him for two years now. He knew, but was told a bunch of crap bout me that was not true by people, and were just friends.   In Oct I went out with a different guy so he prob thinks I am over him.   Anyways him, our two guy friends and our two girl friends were over (one of the girls likes him, we all know) at my house today playing guitar hero. I was sitting on the right side of the couch and he had the rest of the couch and was laying across and was propped up beside my shoulder just a few inches or so away, so I asked if he wanted a pillow or something, he said no I'm good so I said ok.   One of our guy friends came to sit on the couch too and made him move, so he's now in the middle with his legs spread under the table with his shoulder and practically head (I'm smaller then him, shorter, and he's much broader) leaned against me and so I asked are you sure you don't want a pillow? He kinda turned his head and said No, you're my pillow and kinda laughed.   Also I left out a few things like the day before he texted me off of a friends phone on his bus. Not saying much except pretending to be her and asking whats up, also at one of our basketball games (my team played first) i gave him and the guys my cell and ipod and the whole time he had my phone. Also today, when we all left my place to go back to the school (me and the two girls had basketball practice). Him and one the guys took the road while the girls took a trail so i took the road but i was behind like 10-20ft. not even, i was taking my sweet time haha, but he kept looking back and a few times told me to hurry and catch up.   So do you think he kinda likes me or is just more comfortable round me cause he think's I don't like him anymore?   Any other time he'd hate to sit that close to me, usually he'd make sure there was space or even something between us.   Sorry its so long and so descriptive, I'm just trying to give as much info as i can..

He was always faithful, never abusive, and always treated me with respect and love. I miss him and am considering taking him back, but I just don't know if he is the guy for me after all this, and even in the short time we were apart I've begun to grow and change. I'm going to make the decision for myself, but can anyone offer some guidance?
20090129024014AAF0gwJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why does the groom have to ask the bride's father for the bride's hand in marriage?	My fiance did that, and even though I love him, I think that it's a really messed up tradition. I mean, like I need to be passed from the hands of one man to another in my life.      I just think that kind of thinking is really, really outdated.      And I was wondering where it came from, and what other sort of sexist traditions are out there?
20090128220838AA6GFQQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls and guys, what you think about first impression?	I am very understanding and non-judgmental. I will give people the benefit of the doubt until they destroy it. In other words I give every girl a chance.    However my problem is that I don't try to make a good impression. I don't try to impress anyone when I meet them. I'm interested in a girl I just met, but she would have no dam idea because I don't want her to know. If anything I made a bad impression, but that's good because if she can't get past that and like me then I wouldn't date her. In other words I would think she's shallow and not worth my time. Do you guys judge people to be datable when you first meet them? If they make a bad first impression do you associate them with not good? Or do you put all aside until you really get to know the person?

20090128223910AAunYCe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Difficulty forgetting fling with a Mexican Girl. What should I do?	This the second time I'm asking this just for maybe a little more feedback.  Hello everybody. I just got back from Mazatlan, Sinaloa, in Mexico. I had the best time of my life. There are a lot of cheap drinks, beautiful beaches, everyone is very nice and hospitable and in good spirits, plus the women are extremely beautiful.  Now I have a bit of a problem. I met a beautiful 22 year old Mexican girl named Janet at a bar called Joe's Oyster bar. I bought her a drink and danced with her for hours. We had a lot to converse about and had a good time with each other. I was really attracted to her and her to me. She spoke pretty good but not fluent english. After our first meeting we met up several other nights. But the last night i was supposed to see her but never got a chance to. I feel stupid and a bit depressed that I didn't get any info other than her first name. She mentioned her first name but I don't remember now. What should I do? Should I forget about her or is there anyway to find her because I know she has a facebook and has pictures with me. I would appreciate it if anybody could give me any suggestions. Honestly I'd love to find her even to just find out if there was more to whatever feelings I have.
20090128231641AAiHk87	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When a player says, "I'm a one woman guy"? Should you believe him?	I am 22 and he is 27. He has been pursuing me for 4 months but I haven't allowed things to progress into anything further (even though I am secretly falling in love with him).      I found him flirting with another girl through text messaging last week... he said to some girl, "hey baby I miss you where have you been? stop riding your motorcycle you can come ride me anytime you want."      Anyway today I was talking to him about his past and he said he used to be a player and all the girls loved him. I joked around saying, "I reckon you still are a player."   and he said, "no I'm a one woman guy, and you are my only girl."...      I don't know if he means it or not. Should I be convinced with all his sweet-talk?

20090128214042AApzspV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There's this guy. . . I think I'm too MEAN.?	There is this guy I met at my college a few months ago.  We ride the bus together, that's how I met him. We would walk to the general area our classes were after we got off the bus.      Lately I feel like this guy has become too attached/clingy to me! Now I don't talk to him on the bus as much.  I dont ignore him, I just don't initiate conversations with him anymore. Plus, when I get off the bus I walk directly towards my friend and start talking and walking with her. Either he will leave us alone or he will chase her away by not wanting me to wait for her.      I feel he hinders my relationship with my friends. I can't talk to some of them on the bus because he tries to keep me to himself.       I tried introducing him to people so he can talk to other people, but when I introduce him he never wants to talk to them again.      Should I try a different tactic? Am I being too mean to him buy not talking to him as much?

20090128225100AAJwhMC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with me.Why don't guys i like ever find me attractive?	Hey you guys it's official every single time i like a guy they never like me back.It's happened to me all my life consistent rejection from men. I'm tired of dating guys that aren't my age that aren't that attractive and lying to people saying i'm blown away by their personalities, yes i do love guys with personality but even they reject me. Or they'll flirt with me and decide not to commit to anything with me, or play games. Loads of people have said that i'm a pretty girl, i'm an extremely likeable girl, i'm popular most places i go.I'm tired of people talking **** to me saying maybe it's like my lack of self esteem, my lack of confidence, but i've got a best friend who isn't that confident and even on her lower/her lowest days she still gets guys throwing themselves at her. I've had boyfriends of mine/guys that supposedly liked me and 'respect' me, try and chat my friend up right in front of me.The guy i was head over heels in love with told me that he thinks she's sexy, she's like smoking hot he said even though he knew i liked him. There must be something about me that men don't find attractive, something about me that makes me so unattractive to these guys out there. I've given up, i'm not even gonna bother dressing up when we go out or anything. No matter how glamorous i dress or good i look, i always get passed over for one of my friends. Ignored, looked at strangely when i even smile at a guy. I'm tired of being approached by old African men that just like me because they think because i have less attitude than the other black girls out there, and i'm not horrific looking i'll do. Or guys that call me up because they need a counsellor and everybody knows i'm easy to talk to.Ofcourse there's the other side of this fabulous coin, goodlooking guys that use me to validate themselves and their own ego. I'll get the vibe that they like me or their interested and as soon as i reciprocate any warmth, their gone. Guys who basically like my attention but not me.   I don't want to change myself, i'm tomboyish, i love wearing trainers, i love expressing my intelligence, i barely wear high heels, i don't really like wearing high heels. I'm just comfortable. Why should i have to change myself, to get a man to be endeared to who i am isn't that being fake? This hurts, growing up and thinking your equal to all women, then coming down to Earth with a bang because if you don't have this breast size, this bumsize, you don't look like this or walk like this.Your suddenly not enough. And all the qualities you have that you'd like to share with others, doesn't count for nothing because superficially your not who everybody wants you to be.

20090128215010AAZVxLq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy single or not?	Ok, so.  I saw this guy at my school's talent show (lame, I know..hahaa) and he's really hot :DD   Anyways, I found him on myspace, and now I'm thinking he might be going out with this other girl from my school.  His status says "Married," jokingly.  The girl's says "Single," but there are superpoke stuff and everything saying "___ has cuddled with ___" or ___ has held hands with ___"...they're both each other's top friends.  I know it's a stupid question, but it sure would be rather awkward to flirt with a guy with a girlfriend xD   So what do you guys think?

20090128220629AAGuM32	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend likes to wear skimpy clothes that im not comfortable with am i in the wrong?	My girlfriend and i have been going out for over a year and we had a fight regarding the clothes she wears in public. I was over and told her that i really liked the skimpy dress she was wearing. then over the phone shes telling me she wants to wear it to school. The dress is above mid thigh and im uncomfortable with it. I told her it doesnt matter if she thinks its long enough that if i have a problem with it that should be enough. Then she turns it around and says that it should be her decision and that i should care how she feels. Whos wrong here i think its her because ya she can make her own decisions but when it comes to sexuality i think i should have a say.
20090128232408AAxwbcE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A PLAYER kind of guy being mean to a girl? what do you think?	ok so I work with this guy who is kind of a manwhore. he screws around with random girls quite frequently. he pretty much is really foward with girls and sweet talks them and wants them only for sex then moves on..      the strange thing is hes obsessively mean to me and loves to annoy and insult me constantly. every joke he says is at my dispense. hes constantly insulting me whether its about my looks, personality, voice etc i have to admit its quite funny but its rediculous how often and to what extent to he does it to. so i do end up laughing alot. everyone thinks that hes like secretly in love with me but doesnt know how to say it or whatever. hes constantly telling me about the girls hes met or screwed and how he just sweet talks them for sex. its so strange. I just find it crazy considering that he is very upfront with girls and is such a manwhore. i dont understand why he would be shy, if he did like me and would resort to acting mean? why cant he just act normal with me. i think its bizarre
20090128235210AAkgMJf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help! I have a crush and Im married?	I've been married a while now, and I love my husband more than anything in the world. Now, when I was in highschool, I was best friends with a boy. I developed feelings for him and we started to date for a while. When I met the man I married, we hit it off and the chemistry seemed to be alot better with him. So I broke it off with the guy I was dating before I cheated and we fell in love, had a baby, and got married.       Its been about 5 years since I saw the man I left for my husband, and he showed up at a bar me and some friends were at. He is still friends with them and they invited him. He ran up to me and gave me the biggest hug, paid for my dinner, and we pretty much caught up right from where we were since we last saw eachother except for the romantic part. It was so weird to me. He got my number from my friend and has called me a couple times since then. Now obviously, my feelings for him came back after I realized how great together we really were, and I know I can't really do anything about it now, So my question is what should I do? Be mean to him and never talk to him again so I don't slip up? Or just be cordial and have those feelings rush back every time I see him? Do you think they will eventually fade?

Well, I noticed, he's nicer to me than other students. He's cold and expression-less to them but smiling and kind to me. Grades me better.

20090128212203AAqrEFt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women married to Indian(India) men? ?	I'm 18 and I'm a white American girl. My fiance is born and raised here in America, but his family is from India and they're all Hindu. He's very Americanized, polite, funny, caring, loving, affectionate(extremely affectionate : D), completely selfless, and extremely respectful of everybody, especially me. He is also joining the Army in June.      I love him with all my heart and I know he's the one. Call me naive or whatever your heart desires but we're both very mature for our ages. We both want to get married. We go to the same college. I hinted like crazy to him that I wanted to be with him forever and the next day he proposed and I said yes! We want to get married in about 2 years or so right before he gets sent off to war.       I've only told my mother about it and she loves him so she said she's fine with it. I haven't told my father yet but he likes him too so he'll come around soon enough. His mother will most likely disapprove of the marriage(or so my fiance says), but he already told me he doesn't care and that he'd throw away everything to be with me.       But my question is, what is it like being married to an Indian guy? Let alone a Hindu guy? Neither of us are religious at all by the way.

20090128231406AAWjc3U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have this friend....?	And I was pretty intimate with him. We only first met (parents are friends) for the first time a few weeks ago on a saturday. We talked a lot on msn beforehand and really liked each other; like...really! Lol. Anyway; we got to know each other in person and had heaps of fun and sorta kissed and did things. (Not sex though). So; we continued to talk etc. and then he visited my place instead about 2 weeks ago and we had another intimate meeting (again; not sex; just...fun things). He asked me to come back to his house with him and I didn't feel ready to stay over his house so I said sorry but not tonight. He didn't seem to mind. So the next night I text him with the usual stuff like hi how are you and he never replied. And I know he uses his phone all the time cos he uses it for msn so he must have seen the msg. So I talked to him a few nights ago on msn and asked him if he had gotten my text and he said no. I'm not sure but he seemed very distant. We didn't talk as usual and his responses were very short. His name said something like this: If ___ don't reply I'm busy or I don't like you or don't want to talk to you coz you're annoying. Etc. I thought it may be to other people but then I felt as if it applied to me. Then as we 'talked' some more I asked him if he wanted me to come over on Feb 14th (valentine's day/ a saturday) and all he said was Nah. I was so shocked! One moment he wants me to come round and then when I say do you want me to come round he says Nah! Actually I was quite devastated (even though I shouldn't be). I said oh ok then and he said sorry. It said its ok, but its not. A while after I said g2g and went away for a while. When I came back his name was F*** OFF I wanna be far far away. I mean; what the...?! Is that to me?! I still don't know and haven't talked to him since. I'm not going to. He can talk to me if he wants. I try but I can't stop thinking about him. I don't feel the same way about him as before, but I still like him. Please; I need peoples advice.

20090128210540AA3DyCm	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I tell my mom that she needs to discipline my brother?	I'm 16. I have a half-brother who is 5. He throws crazy temper tantrums, hits, bites, screams, punches, pulls hair, kicks, breaks things, and a whole lot more. My mom and my step-dad don't even tell him to stop. He is really big for his age and I'm pretty small. He is physically hurting me on a daily basis and he doesn't get in trouble for it. I know that when I was that age, I would have gotten my butt beat and stuck in the corner. I never acted like that. How do I tell my mom that she needs to control him more. She doesn't even make him go to school anymore, he only went to Pre-k for 3 weeks and since he cried everyday, he got to stop going. I had to go to school when I was 3. My parents expect me to take care of him all of the time, but if he does something bad, I can't even to tell him to stop without being told to stop mothering him. Why can't I mother him, his mother doesn't, so somebody has to. How do I tell my mom that something has got to change without telling her what to do and getting myself into trouble?

20090128213132AAbT8YK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think?? More opinions the better?	So there is this guy.   There is quite an age difference. But I'm trying to figure out if he likes me.   Keep in mind that he does have a significant other already.   -He stares at me   -He does things to make me mad (in a playful way)   -If im upset he will like stroke his hand across my back   -He wont hug anyone else except for his significant other. But when no one is around, he hugs me.   -He brags about me, to his girl, to other people, saying that im a great person and he misses me because im not around as much.         So there you have a few signs. What do u think?

20090128205232AA6WHvL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I Be Upset With My Ex and My Best Friend?	Here's what happend. My boyfriend an I have been going out for about six months now. He tells me the most rediculous thing I have ever heard two days ago. He said, 'We should date other people but still go out.' I said 'Um, no I don't do that. It's called cheating, and it's over.'        Now, I set up my best friend with her boyfriend of one week. My boyfriend and hers are best friends like we are. Yesterday, I found out that my [now ex] boyfriend liked my best friend so I asked him and he said yes.        About three hours ago, I got a text from my bestfriends boyfriend saying 'I guess it's over concidering she told your boyfriend to ask her out.'         I was furious, because according to her he was 'yucky'. I texted him and asked him if this was true. He said, 'Yes, but we didnt want to hurt you so we were going to wait to officially go out until Friday.'  Again, rediculous. She did all of this behind my back. :[        When I get worried+/stressed out I regurgitate so I wasnt in very good condition. I asked him why he wanted us both anyways, he said 'because our relationship is getting boring, I never see you, and she and I are alot more alike.' EVEN THOUGH, I go to his house almost EVERY weekend, we have fun:] and they HARDLY know each other. I really liked him and he still wants to be friends, and so does she. I called her a whore and said the only thing they had in common was that, because I was mad :C           I dont know if I should put any trust in either of them or even be friends with them.
20090128221715AA8cIye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can i say to someone who I basically stalked to get contact details?	I've tried to get to get as many different views on my situation as possible by wording the question in different ways. I met someone i really want to get to know but she lives very far away and to give myself any feeble opportunity at contact i typed her name into myspace and got her hotmail. Is this stalking? If not, what should i say to her because she is unlike anyone I've ever met. She lives around 2 hours away and she has a boyfriend though so I feel I'm screwed anyway.

20090128212216AAJmRZq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to try again... but does he?	Earlier this fall, I started hooking up with a guy friend of mine.  At first, I was only just physically attracted to him, as I knew that he had liked a girl for a very long time without letting her now.  Time passed, and I started to develop an emotional attachment to him, as he did to me.  Well, a few weeks later, this other girl expressed interest in him.  He decided to go for it.  I was understandably upset, but I understood.  Well, about a month later, she broke up with him.  We still hang out, but we haven't hooked up since. There is a bit of sexual tension there for sure though.  I wonder if he still has feelings for me.  Even when he was "exploring" a relationship with this other girl, we would talk, and he told me that if it hadn't been for this other girl, he thought we would have still been together.  I still have feelings for him, and he and this girl have been broken up for about a week now.  I would like to try again, but I don't know if I should make the first move.  How do I get him to make the first move?

20090128211737AAbIBO4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me? Mixed signals?	Sorry for the length, but it's all part of it.  A few months ago, I got out of a 5 yr relationship.  I did not talk to this girl for the 5 yrs because I almost dated her. (And my ex knew and hated her for it.)  We didn't date because she liked someone else instead.  About a month after my break-up, I got in contact with her and planned to meet.  We have hung out several times.  The first few times I tried to kiss her but she would shy away.  Then she text me one time after I tried and basically said she didn't want to be just a "rebound".  We talked and she explained that she wasn't really looking for a relationship.  She has trouble getting close to men because she has a 2yo daughter that she doesn't want to get attached to someone just for them to leave.  She's also dealt with several men that are jerks to her.  After the text, we hang out more as friends and I haven't tried to kiss her again.  She also was sorta seeing a guy when I first started seeing her, but she broke that off a few weeks ago because "he was getting too close."  I have asked if she wanted to go on a date a few times, but I can never get a straight answer.  It's in limbo between "Not at the moment" to "we'll see".  I'll admit that I have been sorta clingy with her because I have fun with her.  I would also describe myself as a very nice guy.  Which also make me doubt how she feels because I feel like she doesn't want to be rude to me because of it.  I really would like to start something with her, but I keep doubting how she feels about me.  So I wanted some opinions from others.        BTW- I am 20 and she is only one month older.  In case age plays a part in somebody's answer.      If you want to know more details, ask them and I'll edit this question.

In high school i had a fling with some guy for over a year, but we werent officially together. Ever since that Ive been by myself. In high school and college I think there were 3 guys that i thought kinda liked me, but they never said anything to me, they would always just CONSTANTLY stare at me (they were all white). I think im a really cool interesting person and im  not ugly. No one ever comes up to me to talk, they always go to my best friend who's tall, skinny, white with long brown hair. Im not tall, skinny or white, but im not fat or short. Im average size and black. When im with my best friend and some guy comes up to us it's usually because that guy just wants to talk to my friend. IM trying not to get jealous of her, but it just really hurts. Im so freakin lonely. I know i shouldnt need a guy to make me feel better about myself, but not having one makes me feel like ****.   Can somebody PLEASE explain to me why i dont have a bf and how i can get one.  Im more attracted to white guys for some odd reason, but i really dont have a preference. I would date any dude of any cultural background.

We have become friends and everything and I think she likes me and I like her too...I guess this is my first time falling in love, but I don't know. I'm sure I like her, but my friends keep making fun of me in school and teasing us. Other people know that she likes me too, but I'm not that sure because...well either I'm a complete idiot, or a super feeling detector. I'm sure if I'd ask her out, it won't end up the same because then people will know that I asked her out, and it wouldn't go well.      I am a bit timid...yeah who am I kidding...I AM TIMID... she also denys that she doesn't like me and everything but i just have this feeling...sooo conflicting!      I've already asked her to go to lunch with me and we went, but I just want to be sure.      We also share a lot in common. Any pointers would be great...

20090128221525AARua1i	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Wet dream, does this make me gay?	Last night I had a dream that Jesus and I were on a cruise together, having a good time. When we got back to our hotel room he became persistent on trying to get some action that night and it was hard to ignore his attempts as we were sharing a twin sized bed. I finally gave in as he began by caressing my body and he kissed from my neck all the way down my chest to my tented boxers...   At that point I woke up with my boxers drenched and a raging hard-on. Does this make me gay even though I couldn't help this experience or is it something I should just forget about?   Thanks in advance for all responses
20090128211740AA0pSDe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Umm, a little (lot) of help please ?	(this happened two months ago)   So i like this guy ALOT, and my guy friend is really close to him, so I asked him totell the guy I liked about me a little and to also tell him that I though he was hot, so he did.   Later he came and informed me that the guys get really neverous and didnt want to meet me. The reason was because my Stupid, Idiotic guy friend told his WHOLE lunch table and the poor guy got embarassed. :/   He wasnt embarassed because It was me that liked him, he was embarassed because my friend told everyone!!   I was pretty embarassed myself.   SOOOO then my guy friend kept on bugging him about me liking him and he got annoyed and doesnt like me.   But the thing is,    I still like him and now he thinks I'm some phsyco freak. :[      What do I do?

Ok...so I really like this guy and at one of our school dances he danced with me and his friend who is my friend told me that he said he really liked me. I then asked him out like three times over the next few months and he said no 3 times and called me fat and ugly. He texts me a lot and is really sweet in his TEXTS. At school the next day he acts like he never texted me. He talks to me sometimes but I have to encourage it. I asked him if he really thought I was fat and he said he was just joking. Then I asked him to rate me from 1-10 and he said 3 1/2. THEN I asked him why he wouldn't date me and he said because I was a friend type. Oh and when I talk to him at school he mostly never looks at me in the eyes. When he does look at me in the eyes he blushes. Boys are so confusing! SO does he like me? or am I wasting my time?

20090128220956AADRNpG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my boyfriend ask: What do you do when your garbage cans are full?	He first asked me this in a text message, and then told me the correct answer was "You use your neighbors." When I asked why he was talking to me so much about garbage cans he didn't respond. Later he said something vague like, "You'll know what it means when your hero is in a hospital bed." He's in the Air Force, but I can't image that he would be laid up in a hospital bed anytime soon.      About a month later he quizzed me on the phone by asking the question again. When I responded with the answer "You use your neighbors," he said, "good." He refuses to tell me what this riddle means, only that when the time comes I will know. I need to know now. Any ideas?

I know guys his age go through a stage of where they don't seem interested in anything, but he is taking it out on me. I mean for almost a year we haven't had any "fun" in the bedroom. And its driving me nuts, I mean I would bend over backwards for him and all I get is the occasional kiss and "I love you." And I know he isn't cheating because we 1. Live in the same house and 2. He never leaves home. So I just don't know what to do anymore. It has me upset and confused.

(sorry if you already saw this in singles & dating, I'm just looking for more opinions)       I'm 18, he's almost 20.....    I've known this friend for some years. He has helped me throught some hard times and he means so much to me. We live a fair distnace apart so we hardly ever see eachother. Last summer he went to LA for a few weeks and when he came home he hardly talked to me. Since then we haven't talked a lot and haven't been able to hang out. There have been some times when we could almost, but something comes up. Tomorrow I am going to his town for a Farm Show and I asked him if he'd show up for a while so we could hang. He has to work at noon, and doesn't want to lose sleep (since he goes to bed so late for w/e reason). I'm in tears right now, am I not even worth two hours of sleep? What happened? We were best friends, and it's not like he only talked to me in hopes of dating me. We had talked about dating and concluded it wouldn't work but we're still great friends. Why can't he give up two hours of sleep for me? Does it mean nothing to him of how much he means to me? I don't understand this. Why do guys do this? Do I even try to hang out with him again? I didn't tell him how upset I am about it cuz I'm a quiet person. Is he even my friend? What does he see me as? i don't understand. Somebody please help me, I hate losing a best friend      If I tell him  we used to be great friends and i just want to spend some time and I'm hurt that he cant lose freakin 2 hours to say hi me... is that acting like a cry baby? Will I just seem immature?

20090128205240AA5EuoY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy friend but apparently he's doing drugs?	So I've been friends with this guy since elementary school but we just sort of rediscovered our friendship like a month ago when we finally started talking again.  I have started to like him and I think that he may like me back.      The problem is, according to his best friend, he's recently started doing pot and he hasn't told me about it so I got this information secondhand.  According to his best friend, the best friend told the guy that I like that he couldn't be his friend if he was doing pot and they haven't spoken in a week, so I'm pretty sure that the best friend is telling the truth.      Also, thrown into the mix, the guy friend just broke up with his girlfriend (who he admitted to me he still loves) and she hooked up with one of his other friends.  I honestly don't know what to think anymore.      Please help!

I'm 22 and I've been going out with my girlfriend who is 26 for about 8 months and I was wondering.. since i have never been in love before, how long does it take before you should know you're in love with someone?      She's breaking up with me because I'm going overseas for my job for a few months and apparently i haven't showed her that I care about her. I do like he I just don't know if I love her.

This is the longest relationship i've ever had and I don't know what to do.

20090128210334AAf3kFq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm just upset about this whole thing. ?	I'm very upset about the upcoming holiday coming up, Valentines day. Its also my birthday. Every year I keep waiting for that big special, I'll never forget birthday/valentines day, and it never happens. This year I was suppose to go to a fancy restaurant and go to build a bear with my boyfriend. I down-graded the restaurant for him from a 4 star to like a 2 star to save him money. I was also hoping for my dream of have long stemmed red roses sent to my work, because I never get flowers from any guy unless I beg or buy them. This guy I'm with now is good to me, but I understand under some circumstances that he has to move so suddenly, he can't afford to do much of anything for this special day. :( I'm know it's EXTREMELY selfish to be upset about this, and wrong. So, I've decided I might send the flowers and try to do the whole ordeal myself, and  I also want to try to do something special for him. Perhaps I should make it about him. It's Valentines Day after all? What should I do for him I guess. Sorry for the rant, no rude comments please.

20090128210121AAWVBtD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i break up with my girlfriend?	so, im 17 and my girlfriend is 17. we have been dating for almost 2 months. I lost my virginity to this girl and i really thought we would be together forever and around the 1 month mark of our relationship, my girlriend started to get real flirty with others guys. she is a flirty girl by personality. and i told her that i didnt like it and she said why dont you like it and said that maybe she doesent need a boyfriend. so i didnt do anything because i really love this girl. then a couple of weeks later, i see her commeting guys saying they are hot and cute and all on myspace. she always gives out her number to anyone. she posted a bulletin on myspace about how she has been talking to this guy on the phone about her life and everything and how he is so cute. and everytime i try to call her she has said that she cant talk. i really do love this girl and all my friends and family say that i should break up with her and that i deserve better. i have done nothing in this relationship to make her cheat on me, we always have the best times together. so what should i do, i mean i really do love this girl. Thank you and God bless      P.S. she is my first real girlfriend
20090128210147AAzjM7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need advice, not sure what to do ?	Ok, here goes. I met this (supposed) wonderful man and we hit it off like I have never with anyone before. We talked 3 1/2 hrs during our first phone conversation, 5 hrs (yes, really) our second. Then we continued our long conversations for days before meeting for our first date. Our first date was wonderful. The connection was there on ALL levels, he couldn't take his eyes off of me & vice versa. Great conversation and overall chemistry. He even told me (before he asked me what I wanted) that he wanted to pursue something with me (and only me). That he saw this possibly developing into a relationship. We did not have sex, he kissed me passionately many times, but was a perfect gentleman. He asked "when can I see you again" twice as he walked me to my door. Then literally the next day we were texting and he said he felt things went a little fast and he felt weird about it. Then he said he is not sure what he wants but that I am "amazing". We agreed to be friends, but he has yet to call me (it's been over a week now). I am confused b/c I really don't think he was lying when he said that he wanted to pursue something. I am not sure if he got scared (b/c he has been hurt before) or what. Any thoughts or advice?

20090128210352AAuOW1w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you feel in this situation? ?	So my boyfriend and I have been going out for 16 months now.  around 6 months he met this girl at a party. so long story short they are now like best friends. he recently told me that she liked him in the beginning until she saw how much he loved me. I've never met her. I dont have anything against her as a person or anything. but when I say best friends I mean BEST friends. he does things with her he doesnt and wouldnt do with me.. and it hurts. and I know for a fact thats she's really pretty& "hot" I guess. every time he says something about her its like being in a ice bath. I freeze. I honestly start to get really cold..   it feels like she's perfect for him. they do the same sports and activities and everything too..   I feel like she's everything I'm not to him.  I trust him and i've talked to him about it. he assures me I'm the one for him.   but I still feel the same    how would you feel in this situation?   any advice?

It was only one time but I have never told my husband and he never told his wife. My husband and him and I have always been great friends and this was just one time when we both needed comfort and took it too far. I don't know wether I should keep this a secret forever or tell him. I feel so guilty but I don't want to tell him out of my guilt and selfishness. His friend also feels like it would devistate him and has begged me for years not to let it slip. I have never said a thing yet, but now I don't know anymore. My husband and I were going through a tough time and now we're really trying to work things out. What should I do.

20090128212602AADxtYk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problems with my girlfriend?	Ok, i have been with my girlfriend for 2 years now. Everything was ok for bout the first year, then we broke up for about a month or 2, in which time we explored other relationships, her more so than me. We now live 3 hours away and are pretty dedicated in talking on the phone all the time and telling eachother everything. But the problem is, whenever we visit, which is quite often, she holds us breaking up and me getting with another girl over my head and will throw fits about it, and she also will pay little attention to me when we are together, tho on the phone she says she wants to see me and cant wait and you know how it goes, im very confused in this, because it seems all we do is eat, sleep, fight, and have sex whenever we are together. Also, i find it unfair, in the sense that i have given up basically everything in my life so that she can feel comfortable with it, because she is paranoid about anything i do, i cant hardly visit my cousin without getting a tantrum, and it is completely opposite from me to her, she is free to do whatever she wants in my eyes, but if i were to try to stop anything that she wants, another tantrum. Is there any way we can fix this? I have never had any feelings for anybody like this before.

20090128212803AAoJO9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When will my broken heart heal?	Ok, I've gotten rid of all his pictures, cards, gifts... even his old t-shirt I used to sleep with just because it smelled like him. My friends said the pain would go away if I got rid of these things. But it's been months, close to a year even, since he broke my stupid heart (told me he changed his mind and didn't want to marry me). So why does it still hurt? Why do I spend every waking moment thinking of him? Every day that goes by that I don't hear from him, is one more day thrown in my face letting me know that he's moved on and doesn't want to be with me. When do you stop asking the "what-ifs"? Please don't tell me  I "need to let go" or I "need to grow up." I wish I could, but it still hurts. Is there hope? :(

20090128213257AAvPLJh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I like him? Does he like me? ?	Okay, so me and this guy have known each other since kindergarten. He lives in the same neighborhood as me (it is a bit far of a walk but it's still manageable) and he's in three of my six classes. He's really nice to me, he says hi to me every time he sees me (especially in English because he walks by my seat to get to his, but it's not like he has to say anything), and I feel like I know him really well. I don't really know if I do like him or not, it's one of those things that I keep going back and forth on because if we do date it kinda messes up the friendship we already have and we can't go back to that (trust me, I've tried this already), but I do see him as a potential boyfriend. He's a nice guy in general, so I don't know if he's going out of his way to talk to me or be nice (sometimes it seems like he's doing this and other times it's up for debate). He's not really the kind of guy that texts or talks on the phone a lot, and he doesn't really use the internet besides researching for homework assignments. We ride the bus together, but I don't see him after school because he doesn't have a seventh period so he leaves early. I'm not really getting my hopes up very high because I've learned that if you do that and you get rejection, you fall a lot harder. I'm honestly not even sure if I like him very much that way (I know I'm attracted to him, but I'm not sure if it's much more than a "crush"). I have a lot of other options, I know that; I just wanted an opinion that wasn't biased because you know me or anything like that. I like another guy for sure, but I hardly ever see him except at church, so I dunno. *shrugs* What do you think?

20090128215539AA3Iwsc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Everybody hates my girlfriend. Why?	Just about everybody hates my girlfriend. I used to be a crazy partier, but I pulled my life into the slow lane after 6+ years college so that I wouldn't be a pathetic 30 year old raging alcoholic. I could not have done this without the assistance of my lovely girlfriend of 4+ years, who has been there for me through the tough times and has saved my bacon more times than I can count. If I hadn't met her, I'd probably be in prison.       She is well educated, attractive, super sweet, and always wants what is best for me unconditionally. Her influence has turned my life around and made me a vastly better person, but she is a little quirky, and can be pretty boring. Basically, instead of going out to bars, we stay home and watch movies, but we do some cool weekend trips and we get out of the house enough.       But the hatred; my old drinking friends want to kill her, my parents dislike her, my extended family chooses to throw around racist Mexican comments though she is half Irish, half Spanish, and many of my friends refuse to even get to know her. One of my oldest friends who is also my roommate makes up lies about her and thinks he has her all figured out, but he hasn't uttered more than a sentence to her in over 4 years.       I just don't understand... The only person who seems to see that she is good for me is my sister, while it seems everybody else wants me to fall back into drinking myself to vomiting and unemployment. Why does everybody want to see me fail, cold and alone?

20090128215855AAtn1i8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Tell me the truth! does he like me?	l'll start from the begining, at first i caught him staring at me so i stared back, then we glanced away. A couple of minutes later i looked back to see if he was still staring at me and i think he had the same idea and glanced at me. From then on we shared quick glances for a while although he would never talk to me and he would avoid me.This lated a couple of months. Sometimes we would walk past each other and not look at each other although people could tell we were ignoring each other, now he makes a effort to talk to me when theres no way we can talk (eg, he would say "hey" when i would be rushing to class, he would say hello to the people im talking to and try and get in on the convo, he would talk to the person sitting next to the person im talking to, if my folder is on the table in class and he is handing out sheets he stares into my eyes and then say "dr who??" and looks towards my folder where theres a dr who pic, etc) and im not sure if he likes me or is being nice to me becausee he thinks i like him??

(bad way to start this out, I know) I've met him three times. I know he isn't a creep because he is one of my sister's friend's friends, who is also my friend. ANYWAY. I'm fourteen, and he is seventeen. He will be eighteen in half a year, then he will be illegal. I act much older than a fourteen year old, look much older, and, feel much older. I really like this guy, and he really likes me. He knows I'm not going to do anything sexually with him, and he is absolutely okay with that. I never can find someone who really gets me.. and, well.. he does. I just need to know if it would be a really bad idea to date him. All I want is someone around, and so does he. He hasn't asked me out but I think he might.. and I just don't know what to say if he does. help me out, please?

20090128222207AAh9IkA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Its about a girl. (serious answers only please!)?	basically, theres a girl at college that i am interested in having more than just a friend status relationship with, but i recently found out that she just broke up with her boyfriend a couple weeks ago.my concerns are as follows: is it too early for her to start a new relationship and does she still like him (which most signs point to "no"), i know for a fact that he does like her and wants her back. Now i would also like to clear up that i am a nice guy, a guy who has known the face of rejection and betrayal in the hands of women, but a guy who has also experienced  the pain that is felt when you like someone but are not liked back. that being said, I dont want the be the cause of pain for somebody, i dont want to be the person who brings upon the same pain that i have experienced in the past. what should i do?

She has two kids that I get along with and we always do stuff with them too, which I pay for.  We have been texting each other lately but not as much and all she does is complain about her life and never asks me about my day or how things are going with me.

20090128232709AAbQ1mC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex Girlfriend?????Will we get back together?	My ex girlfriend broke up with me 4 weeks ago.  She said she was confused, young, and wanted to not be tied down.The first few weeks we talked to each other at least once a day, sometimes her calling sometimes me calling.  Early on me calling, later on her calling. We went out on a couple dates as well.  No sex though, I made this clear.   Occassionaly we would hold hands on our dates and kiss and tell each other I love you.  On 2 different occasions she called me more than 10 times in 45 minutes but I ignored them.  4 days ago I was tired of being in limbo so I asked her if she was thinking about getting back together.  She said no, she had been thinking about me but not the relationship.  So I told her it was too hard on me to keep talking to her and just be friends so I iniated no contact. Well since then she has called and texted and even used facebook to try and get me to talk to her each day.  Usually things like whats up, how are classes (we r in college), telling me good job for studying so much and she told me that she knows that it is hard for me to talk to her but she hopes I will talk to her soon and that even though it's tough on me that "it's possible"  whatever that means.  So my question(s)   -Do I keep ignoring her and doing no contact? and if so for how long?   -Does she want to be friends for good, friends until we get back together, or is this her way of telling me she  wants to get back together?   -If it is that she wants to be friends should I be friends or not?  It's hard on me but we started out as friends before we started dating.      **2 facts I forgot** She is not dating/ seeing anyone else and we dated for 2 years.

20090129023229AA10gsX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship etiquette, what is the norm?	I have a friend who expects to correspond via sms or now via facebook.  As I don't see her often I expect a phone call if she wants to catch up, or meet.  It seems to take weeks to actually get together and we spend more on the texts than a call would take, and a lot of wasted time.      I have always called her to catch up, but since I stopped calling expecting that she might actually call me for ONCE!!!! she finds a cheaper and more annoying way to get in contact.        Is it just me, or is this rude?

However I dont see her that often because we go to diffrent colleges, but when we all get together and hang out it always turns into me and her talking all night. Now heres my question...She knows that I like her but we never bring it up to eachother....she tells me that she dosnt like it when guys seem to needy and overbearing when trying to go out with her....we text back and fourth every one in a while, but I want to start talking more to her...do you think if I start to text her more often just to say whats up and talk about small stuff she will think Im being needy or overbearing? And do you think that it might seem wierd if I suddenly start texting her more? Thanks for the help!

When I met him he owned his own business, set his own hours, and led me to believe that he could make at least half of my income.  Now, he doesn't work for days, sits around and reads novels all day, and refuses to help with housework.  Now he's lying about his delinquent bills and won't answer phone calls from the bank.  Whenever I get on to him about his income, he starts acting like he's getting another job but never actually does.

20090129033533AA2993V	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My fiance is being an absolute cranky pants!?	ok, i know he's stressed.. i know he's been working a lot, and misses his kids more because of it. i know he's been having a hard time dealing with his pain in the neck father... i know he's got a lot going on... but lately, he is getting pissy about EVERY little thing...       now, normally, i am good about "picking my battles" with him... i know not everything is worth fighting over... he is not, but usually, its not this big of a deal.. but lately, its been an every night thing.. he always finds SOMETHING insignificant to get angry about with me.. its a bit much. he lets it go by morning, but i cant take it anymore...       i've talked to him, but he keeps saying that he's getting mad because its me who keeps insisting on whatever it is i need to know or do... like, here's an example - 2 nights ago, he said his daughter had a project she needed to work on and since she was going to be home with me that afternoon, i was trying to get more info so i could make sure she was doing it correctly... there was a note sent home about it, but it went to their mothers house... i asked him what she needed to do and when he didnt give me a full answer, i mentioned that there was a note but i thought it was at their moms, and he didnt remember the note and started getting mad cause i wouldnt stop asking questions. i figured he'd say, "ok, i'll talk to their mother in the morning and find out." but no... well, whatever, so i quit, and didnt do the project with her. she could do it at her moms the next day... last night, we fought over who farted.. he kept saying it wasnt him, i said it wasnt me, and he got mad cause i insisted it wasnt me.. it was SO STUPID!       this morning, i said very nicely, "babe, can we please stop fighting about every little thing. we fought over a fart last night!" he says he got pissed cause i was insisting, and it was like he was starting the fight all over again.. if i hadnt shut down and stopped talking, it would have gotten him mad again.. and the weird thing is, last year, at this same exact time, the same thing was happening, we were fighting every night about the stupidest stuff for about 2 weeks... it got really bad.. i dont think i can deal with that again... what do i do?

20090129040042AAgBxaX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm somewhat confused... help? ?	Mk. So.      This is about a guy named Austin.    He's an eighth grader, and though I'm a year younger, he always acted like we were friends.      On the second week of the school year, I was in the car loop. He was there, though I didn't take much notice of him. Sam, my friend, was there too. Austin randomly jumps up to her and screams, "I'M GONNA ASK OUT THE FIRST SEVENTH GRADER I SEE." Sam screams back, pointing a finger in my face, "Oh my god! She's a sevvie!"       That's the first time a cute boy really asked me out, but I know it was just a joke. xD So I laughed along. "Emily, this is Austin, my cousin," Sam told me. I said hello hesitantly; he seemed really weird. He screamed "hello" back in my face and bounced off to the chorus room.      There was a powderpuff game not too much later. I was in the carloop with Austin; we weren't really good friends, but we were friendly and we talked some. He randomly turns to me and asks me if I'm going to the powderpuff game. "Yeah, but I'm going home, first," I answered. He suddenly whirled on me and begged me to stay at school with him. Surprised, I decided I would.       We spent all the time before the game just ransacking the school, looking for crap and disrupting play practice, chorus practice, track practice... Like, everything. I've never had so much fun.      Much later, I found out he was spreading a rumor behind my back.   Calling me Rosie O'Donald - because he thought I was fat.   I was furious, but I did find it in my heart to forgive him.      Now, when we see each other in the halls, I say hi, but he doesn't say it back. Usually he's with his friends and his girlfriend, so I don't mind. I'm assuming he doesn't hear me; too many people are crowding around him and talking to him. He doesn't say hi to me, but I still think of him as a friend.      His MySpace has an album of pictures that people made dedicated to him. Rhianna made a picture with her holding up an "Austin <3" index card; so on. I made one about him, and when he saw it, he commented:      I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it!            Thank you[:   Thank you[:      I'll make you one when I get a new camera, it broke today.   xD      So soon..      I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it!""      Yeah.   We still talk in the car loop; a couple times I would sit down and he'd jump on my lap and cling to me.   I remember saying, "Would be hilarious if my dad walked up and saw this guy sitting on my lap."   He got up after that, but we couldn't help but laugh.   His friends are slowly becoming my friends.      But sometimes I wonder if he really values me.   He doesn't say hello in the halls anymore; he never invites me to go anywhere with him.   But...   I don't know.      Help?

20090129035212AAgw1jS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why doesnt the csa ever listen?	Why do they never take notice of what the non resident parent has to say  .They all arent all dead beat dads .Some of them are caring and have had their children taken out of their lives due to the mother and her actions .So why doesnt the csa believe what they have to say .Mothers making stories up of how the fathers dont care and have never paid a penny when they have   or declaring that the children are working. Mean while the NRP keeps paying through the nose and is sometimes forced into giving up their homes as they cannot afford to rent The csa just seem to ignore the all the rules they put in place each case worker uses a different system unless its for the parent with care   the whole system is WRONG  .

20090129035028AAxg8XI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I Out Of Order or should I Tell her?	I met  man and  we seemed solid apart from the fact he could only get over to my house two or three times a month. After 17 months he admitted he had a wife, no children and a full other life. I was gutted but couldn't find it in me to leave as he had been there for me when i needed some one. ( i miscarried his child )      last week, he broke up with me, telling me "His wife found out and threw him out, he doesn't want me in his life, he wants her back" she read the texts messages he sent me telling me how much he loved me and about how he was planning to leave his marriage as it was "dead in the water".       he has played games with my head, now i want to find his wife and tell her what shes married to, as she found out before he had cheated though thought it was a one off and not a ongoing thing thing so took him back am i out of order?         **i loved this man for years and he waited for until he knew i wouldnt want to leave him, before tellin me he was married, he lied and filled my head with rubbish about how he and his wife where fighting all the time and barley speaking, and sleeping in seperate beds**      If you where her would you want to know? or speak to me? would it be easier for her to know the full truth?, i hold my hands up i should have walked away when he told me about her, i was outta order then, or would you want to be left alone?
20090129035952AAYDQ01	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just need some answers on this one thanks:D?	So, one of my ex's and I broke up like almost 3 years ago now, we didn't speak for about 2 years during that time. During that time, I slept with one of his best friends because I really hurt after the break-up and this guy also cheated on me with my " so called" best friend while we were together.   Anyways, he just found out around Christmas time that I did sleep with his best friend, but he hasn't brought it up to me I found out by one of his friends that he knows.   I saw him at Christmas and he was just really distant with me and not really talkative!   I feel really bad for doing this, because I am not that type of person at all... I don't like to hurt people and even though he cheated on me it hurts me to know that he has found out about this.

20090129032552AA6z9oF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband say we are done just because i chatted to learn Arabic.?	Okay, he and i are both so busy so i took it upon myself to chat so that i can learn Arabic. Arabic is his mother tongue and to be honest i am sick of hearing, " wa ...spit.... ha and kha ..... halas" and other choice sounds and words with no clue as to what he is saying. I have learned to say some words and can pick up on any of his conversations at about 20 percent. But at 20 percent, he might as well be talking Martian too!. I just think his language is beautiful and want to learn it. Well,  today i learned some words and text'd some to him. He flipped out and said that we are done. That is insane. I told him what i was doing and he had no problem with me chatting. I even told each person i chatted with that i was married and that i wanted to learn Arabic only. Now im under so much anxiety and stress. I can't learn from the internet and books only. I even took a class and i am no better in Arabic. I believe in dealing with real people to learn what i can't get from a dead site ,  book or structured class. According to him the words that i learned were not appropriate. But it was really innocent like i want to hug you and such. One word maybe was aggressive but i wanted to learn that  word. Now he hates me and i am confused. Do i leave since we are done as he claims? My husband is from the conservative Arab world so i understand where he is coming from. But really! ...im getting tired of not wearing this or that and let us not get into my whole social life that was revamped! Help, I would like some suggestions from anyone on what i should do. I am really fustrated because i can't take this anymore.

20090129033527AAJzRO2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think that he wants?	We ended our almost relationship because he said he couldn't give me what I wanted. So now I'm trying to get over him, however every time I see him he constantly strokes my face or my arms. This does not help me, and to top it off he made the comment in an argument that I don't pay him enough attention to show that I'm interested and then laughed it off, even though he ended us. That comment did not come from nowhere, but he doesn't want to talk about it.    I'm scared that he doesn't know what he wants, what should I do? I still care for him, but if I have to move on, then I should.
