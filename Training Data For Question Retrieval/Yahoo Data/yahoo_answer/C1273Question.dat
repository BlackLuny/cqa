20090307182231AAJnSsZ	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	I did 2 ecstasy tablet's.. help.?	I done it exactly 2 weeks ago.   So I was in my room And I took them both at the same time, because it was apparently low mdma. Not even 40 mins I felt the high. I was very happy happy happy.. happiest and nicest girl on earth. I was lisin to my ipod and lying on my bed. And seeing everything as beautiful. After 2 hours Im still that happy person, and I was looking at my ceiling and I see stars.. then some flowers and stuff, it was blue, and stuff. I was like wow.. hallucinating, how can this be. I warned my self its just the ecstasy, chill and have a good time. But my heart was pounding so fast .. I couldnt control my emotions. I wanted not to be scared. I was like why am i even scared of, be ******* happy! I couldnt be happy, so i went on the computer to just chill.. and.. I was still scared and my computer looked small and the door looked small. I was freaking out. I could hear my heartbeat. It was crazy touching it. I thought Im dying. I decided not to tell my mom anything untill it gets worse. So after 5 hours I got the chills and I wanted to vomit and just die. My heart was still pounding fastfastfast. And I was so irritated. Everything was irritating, even music was. Eveeerything. Closing my eyes I wanted to vomit. I was grinding my teeeeth so badley. I couldnt feel it though. So I was sick for about 7 days exact. And even now.. if i gaze at something for 30seconds I can see it moving . Its creepy. And I do feel very depressed! And right now, I dont feel as if.. Im alive.. Its like im asleep. SOmetimes i still freak out.. thinking im on the ecstasy- bad trip. How can this be?

20090307185320AA39vJl	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Integration question about cylindrical revolutions?	The function is y = x^3. The question is asking me to evaluate its volume at y = 2. The other information is that the curve is bounded by y = 1, y = 8 in the y direction and x = 1 and x = 2 on the x direction.       I know that by revolving it will produce a cylindrical shell with circumference 2pi*x, thickness dx and radius of 2 - x. The other bits of the information seems unclear to me. There are two y values, 2 and 1 and then there's the function itself y = x^3. I know that I'm supposed to subtract one from the other so is it safe to say this:       ∫ 2pi(2 - x)(2) dx - ∫ 2pi(2 - x)(1) dx... Evaluated from 1 to 2

20090307200931AA6qYFR	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Dreamed of car design, studied architecture, but now I want to do mechanical engineering.?	Hi, my dilemma is a difficult one. After being out of school for a year, and working for a few months at a job/taking some time to job hunt, I realized that I should go for mechanical engineering, something that I was always scared of but I can't ignore it because my passion lies there.      I was always interested in cars, and wanted to be a car designer. I realized it's quite difficult to get into it, so I tried the next thing: Architecture. I was into it but didn't love it. So much so that for my thesis I did it on buses and subways, and not on buildings.      My question is, is there anyone who finished architecture and then applied for mechanical engineering? Obviously these don't share any ground except some basic math and physics. Could someone share some experience/advice?

I recently was watching some kind of Chinese discovery channel out of boredom, and came to a scenic show which I thought would be perfect to complement my meal for McDonalds. Turns out it was a discovery channel on butterflies.      Interestingly enough, it showed a type of butterfly (I now know is the Maculina rebeli (Large Blue I think) butterfly) who's caterpillars mimicked ant larvae, and got the ants to feed it.      However, at one point there was some kind of predator (a wasp by the looks of it, but I'm not too sure) that invaded the ant nest, caused mass confusion and inner conflict within the colony, and found the caterpillars, which it then injected something into them.    When they completed their metamorphosis, the infected pupae actually turned into the wasp instead. WICKED, but what's the wasp/bug called?!      Thank you!

20090307215004AAe5nAB	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics problems help?	1) In 1990 Walter Arfeuille of Belgium lifted a 281.5-kg object through a distance of 17.1 cm using only his teeth.   (a) How much work did Arfeuille do on the object?   281.5 kg(9.8 m/s^2)(0.171 m) = 471 J   (b) What magnitude force did he exert on the object during the lift, assuming the force is constant.      so, is it F = work / displacement = work / height = 471 / 0.171 = 2754.3860? I typed in 2754 in the box on webassign but it says Your answer is off by a multiple of ten. Oh yeah and the unit is suppose to be kN. What am I doing wrong?      2) A 7.80-g bullet moving at 650 m/s penetrates a tree trunk to a depth of 5.0 cm.   (a) Use work and energy considerations to find the average frictional force that stops the bullet.      I know how to do part a. the answer is 32955 N.   (b) Assuming the friction force is constant, determine how much time elapses between the moment the bullet enters the tree and the moment it stops moving.      I can't do part b.   Momentum change = m*v   Impulse = F(avg)*Δt   Δt = m*v/F(avg)      Δt = 0.078(650)^2 / 32955 = 1? Am I using the right equation?      3) Find the height from which you would have to drop a ball so that it would have a speed of 5.2 m/s just before it hits the ground.      I'm not sure how to do this one.      5) A 42.0-kg projectile is fired at an angle of 30.0° above the horizontal with an initial speed of 103 m/s from the top of a cliff 128 m above level ground, where the ground is taken to be y = 0.      (a) What is the initial total mechanical energy of the projectile?   the answer is 275474 J   (b) Suppose the projectile is traveling 85.0 m/s at its maximum height of y = 240 m. How much work has been done on the projectile by air friction?   the unit is in J but I don't know how to do this one.   (c) What is the speed of the projectile immediately before it hits the ground if air friction does one and a half times as much work on the projectile when it is going down as it did when it was going up?   the unit is in m/s. I'm not sure how to do this one either.

20090307214943AAVtpmV	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Parapsychology	Freaked About Telekinesis?	Ok... SO, I completely and totally out of the blue, decided I wanted to try telekinesis. What better thing to do than go to the internet!? Well, that's what I did. I found a page, ready through it, and saw that the easiest form was of telekinesis was maneuvering a candle flame. It said meditation helped, so I googled meditation, and found an instructional audio, which I listened to. After this, I felt incredibly relaxed. I then went to the kitchen, got a candle, lit it, brought it to the living room, and then sat myself and the candle on the floor. It was dimly lit, and the scent of the candle also helped to relax me. I did as the website instructed, and stared at the base of the flame, attempting to establish a "telekinetic link" with it. I sat there for about 5 minutes, making sure my breath did not hit the flame--it was completely calm. My eyes became defocused, and mind my went almost blank staring just below the flame, but I was still concentrating. Then, I felt a tingling sensation throughout my body--my arms and legs felt slightly weaker. I refocused my eyes, and say that the flame was literally jumping up and down. It was going crazy, and I honestly started freaking out. I tried to keep my mind open about the subject before I had started, but I really didn't think anything would happen, at least not so soon. Anyway, I tried to blow it out after a couple seconds, because I felt very weird, and was pretty scared. However, I couldn't blow--I noticed I hadn't been breathing as I was concentrating so hard. I took a breath, and made another attempt. It went completely out, and then a second later, burst back up as I felt the sensation again. Then, I blew it out, and looked away. It stayed out, and I no longer felt any connection to the energy.      Now, all that I wrote above is completely true. And I'm very logical and scientific, so things I can't explain scare me. I'm asking if anyone else has had such an experience, because it's really freaking me out. Give me something please!

20090307225511AA4ERNn	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Is time travel possible?	Here is what I believe. I think thats its impossible for time travel to ever occur for one reason. Let's say that I invent a time machine in the year 2039. I go back and visit myself here in the year 2009. I go and tell myself that Im myself from the future. We talk and such and then I go back in the time machine back to 2039. Hypothetically in the years from 2009-2039 I cant die. If i tried to kill myself, i wouldnt be able to because if i did kill myself then how would i have been able to come back and visit me from 2039? It just wouldnt make any sense if time travel existed. Also another reason is that we never see  people from the future...Please give me your ideas on time travel. Im very interested and i will read all your comments no matter how dumb they sound.

20090307232451AAjNsXl	Science & Mathematics;Biology	BIOLOGY!!!!*please help* multiple choice?	1) Which of the following would be a position held by an adherent of the punctuated equilibrium theory?   a. a new species forms most of its unique features as it comes into existence and then changes little for the duration of its existence.   b. one should expect to find many transitional fossils left by organisms in the process of forming new species.   c. given enough time, most existing species will gradually evolve into new species.    d. natural selection is unimportant as a mechanism of evolution   e. most speciation is anagenetic.       2) The camera-type eyes of octopuses are very complicated and have many of the same features as the camera-type eyes of vertebrates. Yet, the eyes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not homologous. This situation is an example of   a. misalignment of sequences   b. homoplasy   c. substitution mutations    d. gene duplication   e. homogeneity      3)The four-chambered hearts of birds and the four-chambered hearts of mammals evolved independently of each other. If one were unaware of this independence, then one might logically conclude that   a. the common ancestor of birds and mammals had three-chambered hearts.    b. birds and mammals are more distantly related than is actually the case    c. early mammals possessed feathers   d. the common ancestor of birds and mammals had a four-chambered heart.   e. birds and mammals should be placed in the same class.      4) Phylogenetic hypotheses (such as those represented by phylogenetic trees) are strongest when   a. they are based on amino acids sequences from homologous proteins, as long as the genes that code for such proteins contain no introns    b. each clade is defined by a single derived character.    c. they are supported by more than one kind of evidence (such as when fossil evidence corroborates molecular evidence)   d. they are accepted by the foremost authorities in the field.   e. they are based on a single putatively homologous DNA sequence.      5) Over evolutionary time, many cave-dwelling organisms have lost their eyes. Tapeworms have lost their digestive system. Whales have lost their hind limbs. How can natural selection account for these losses?   a. natural selection cannot account for losses, only for innovations.   b. it can account for these losses by the principle of use and disuse    c. under particular circumstances that persisted for long periods, each of these structures presented greater costs than benefits.   d. these organisms had the misfortune to experience harmful mutations, which caused the loss of these structures.   e. b and d only

Ok so I have a six inch stainless steel rod (3/8 in diameter) and 100 ft of  insulated 20 awg threaded copper wire. I want to use a computer power supply for my power source. In order for my vote of best answer, you must at least answer each of the questions.   1.  Will stainless steel be sufficient or will it be such a poor core that it is a mistake?   2. If I want a strong magnet, should the core be shorter?   3. When I wrap my coils, should i wrap them tightly or leave an air gap?   4. Is threaded wire inferior to solid copper for this task? If so, relatively how inferior?   5. For this scenario, should I leave only one layer or many layers of wrapped coils?   6. As long as I insulate the wire from the rod, can I strip it to bare copper and wrap that tightly? or is it bad for the coils to interact?   7. How will drilling a hole through the core parallel to the length help or hurt strength? Same question with a series of holes perpendicular to the length?   8. What power setting should I use from the power supply? +/- 12v or +/-5v?      Thanks so much. The most important question is why? Sources are great. If you have a book or publication that answers these questions a summary with citation gets best answer ASAP.
