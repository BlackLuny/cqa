Company is doing okay so far....|`|7jNYqtWOaa	I'm not so much afraid of losing my job, but if too many jobs in my community are lost, EVERYONE will suffer.  More unemployed means more crime, more taxes, more stress and everyone is expected to do more with less.  And when this situation spreads--which it has-- then that means more people in many more countries are in uproar.<br>  <br>  My ultimate fear is that this global discontent erupts in WWIII, much like Germany did starting in 1932 as the global depression was winding down.|`|biPiIIeMaa	I'm not too concerned about MY job as a soldier. My mom's company is actually continuing to produce enormous profits, and finished 2008 27% higher than anticipated. My dad is an airline pilot, but is too senior in experience, so he has several hundreds if not thousands of employees below him that would go first. In fact, the only people I know of personally that have lost their jobs are workers in the auto industry, which is almost entirely the industry's fault for making crummy vehicles that people are now realizing they don't want to have to replace every three to five years while paying hefty fees at the pump at the same time. And a lot of competitor-type businesses, such as Circuit City had to close down, but everyone I know had preferred Best Buy over them anyway, so it was inevitable.

But could it be to fill a void, like a lack of attention from your parents.|`|Ml8n0rqMaa	Too much structure & strictness.  You need an outlet (a release) that is safe.  A hobby, activity, club, sport, etc.  Something that won't get you into trouble.<br>  <br>  Example:  Skydiving|`|58a280b909e38ffa527544e0e898256eaa	it might be because of restriction or rebellion but i strongly advise against it don,t become unclean in the face of your family they will be rather upset.|`|2C1C3Zfyaa	i think your parents must put too much pressure on you and try to hold you down. Most young people act out that way because of overprotective parents or pushy parents. But it could be your way of exploring since your young. Almost every young adult does things like that, it's the one's whose parents have kept them on lock that take it to the extreme. But still, normal process no matter how pissed your parents get at you.|`|85Co7zE8aa	i think you are bored.<br>  it's not really that you want attention per say, but based on the straight-a student thing, i think life is just too easy for you. so you find ways to make it harder, so you feel more emotion.

If they make a comment just take it lightly.  If you get upset they'll see there's something wrong about your thinness and they won't stop making comments.<br>  <br>  why would you hate yourself?  Are those comments really that important?  If you are tired of them, ignore them.  Don't let other people decide what makes you valuable.  Your body is the only body you have.  Whatever happens to it can scar you physically and mentally for the rest of your life.  Don't listen to comments that make you have negative thoughts about yourself.

Maybe you should find someone for him to talk too, someone to help him figure this out a close uncle, or male friend of the family if not a psychologist.  You might want to keep your involvement quite for the time being so he's not angy with you.  Good Luck I wish you and your boys the best.  I wish someone would've helped me like this when I was they're age, I was the same way.|`|85Co7zE8aa	it doesn't sound like anger management issues, it sounds like oppression or paranoia. i mean, i'm no psychologist or expert, but it seems like he's really perceptive, like if there is a flicker of hatred or annoyance he notices and magnifies it. it could possibly be that he feels like secretly people hate him, so he's paranoid about them showing it, and he does everything in hi power to stop it, including being violent. <br>  so maybe talk to a psychologist?|`|Mejzhipyaa	Sounds like my daughter, and she is bi-polar.

n3Rx3PYyaa	.<br>  Thought provoking question.  Was not aware that people who've experienced trauma and abuse evolved to work mostly from the right brain.<br>  <br>  Reason for that might be that people who've experienced trauma and abuse strive to see the "big" picture.  To think "outside-the-box".<br>  <br>  Right brain is more-so creative, empathetic, etc.<br>  Left brain is more linear, logical, "by the numbers".<br>  <br>  The mind knows that trauma and abuse is not logical, not right.  The right side of the brain is what messages that awareness.<br>  <br>  Many of the most "creative", artistic, talented people in life have come from backgrounds of abuse, trauma, hardships, limitations of body or life events...i.e. philosophers, inventors, comedians, theatre performers, writers, scientists, artists, discovers, explorers . . .<br>  .

ZYp1AEspaa	Not really. Women got to be secretaries, girlfriends and gofers. A noted Black activist (not sure who, maybe Eldridge Cleaver or Stokely Carmichael, when asked what position he saw for women in the movement, replied, "prone." <br>  <br>  This was the state of things in all the radical groups around that time. The way women found themselves sidelined in these supposedly progressive and revolutionary groups certainly fueled the frustration and resentment that kick-started the women's liberation movement.|`|FUIBscKGaa	All of the movements stemmed from the feminist movement.  I'm surprised that people don't know when it started.  It started with the suffragists, and the origins of what we know as Feminist Theory, predates the Civil Rights Movement.  The feminists theorized that if they could secure their own rights, that the other groups would follow.  My parents were heavily involved in the feminist movement, as well as all of the intersecting movements.  The movements helped each other, as everyone was fighting to be free from the same thing, which was all white male rule.<br>  <br>  Of course there were many black women present in the whole movement.   (was it Nataly?  Sorry, I can't see who) linked to a site that shows many.  The whole movement consisted of a whole bunch of different small community action groups working towards the same goal.  Pretty amazing when you think about it.|`|AA11962853	Hey Woman...why don't you strap on a bomb and run into Patriarch Belch?

Even if gender could have changed, they were still black. Same thing today. Yeah...what if I become a dangon man? Won't my dangon skin color still be the dangon same? Not that I'd want to be a flipping man, though.

YUEVhOxsaa	Laughter is an extremely common defensive mechanism for people under stress. It's your bodies reaction to your stress and it's attempt to ease it by clearing the lungs, reducing the  hormones that produce stress, increase muscle activity and circulation, release endorphins and helping to produce a calmer state of mind - All things that laughter can do for your body.|`|sPbOz2Xtaa	That is a great way to react to stress.  I'm just in the process of re-learning how to react to stress (which is/was mostly in negative ways).

It should have happened to you and not her.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	I think it shows a strong improvement on Turkish views on honor killings and their desire to make an example of criminals.  As long as each individual was tried separately, I'm glad to see that people are being held accountable for these horrific crimes.|`|gYbe3BNeaa	I believe you.  These women have been brainwashed by the culture, they know nothing else. They are ignorant, supersticious peasants who know nothing of the world outside the parameters of their own village.  The men are just as stupid.  All Turkey can do is wait until their generation is dead and gone.<br>  **************************************...<br>  Each convicted person would have been tried individually (of course) and found guilty or not guilty and sentenced.

I'm grateful for it.<br>  <br>  Instead of complaining about women getting educations and good jobs, maybe these guys should start asking why so many women want to get a no-fault divorce now that the option is available.  It's a reflection on the spouse and the quality of the relationship.

I see how we kick men to the wayside and just use them as sperm donors, just a provider that's it but I see that every male could be my son, and every female can be my daughter and I hope that someone out here may treat every person with respect and kindness because it may be your family out there.<br>  You may have all the education in the world, it is not a guarantee of success or wealth and having education does not give you the intelligence to be a respectful person who can  make wise choices.

Looking at lawsuits, school board hearings and private correspondence between textbook editors, Ravitch, a professor of education at New York University, shows how publishers are squeezed by pressure from groups on the right (which object to depictions of disobedience, family conflict, sexuality, evolution and the supernatural) and the left (which correct for the racism and sexism of older textbooks by urging stringent controls on language and images to weed out possibly offensive stereotypes)-most publishers have quietly adopted both sets of suggestions. In chapters devoted specifically to literature and history texts, Ravitch contends that these sanitized materials sacrifice literary quality and historical accuracy in order to escape controversy. She also discusses how current statewide textbook adoption methods have undermined competition and brought about the consolidation of the educational publishing industry, leading to more bland, simplistic fare. There is no shortage of colorful examples: a scientific passage about owls was rejected from a standardized test because the birds are taboo for Navajos; one set of stereotype guidelines urges writers to avoid depicting "children as healthy bundles of energy"; editors of a science textbook rejected a sentence about fossil fuels being the primary cause of global warming because "[w]e'd never be adopted in Texas." Readers will likely disagree about whether, on balance, anti-bias guidelines do more harm than good, but Ravitch's detailed, concise, impassioned argument raises crucial questions for parents and educators.

oTwymgpIaa	I think your viewing this incorrectly, let me explain. Shortly after blacks were given rights it was very difficult for them to find employment due to racism. This created a situation where they became dependent upon the government, it is also the reason many blacks are bitter. Indians are treated like Gods in this country, but the black man has never received any type of compensation other than laws being passed to prevent discrimination and slavery, and those laws aren't very effective, this is hardly compensation for what whites did to them. The welfare system is designed in such a way that it keeps people dependent, how does this help anyone? Blacks deserve to be angry about what this country has done to them if you compare what we did for the indians. It isn't a false claim, it is a true claim, but if you really think about it, does welfare really help the majority of people who use it? I don't think so, I think it was designed to keep people stupid, uneducated, dependent, powerless, and living in poverty while being looked down upon, discriminated against, and disrespected by the majority of society. I know this because I received welfare for about six months, and I've never been treated so badly in my life, and this ill treatment  came from the welfare office. 73% of all money intended for welfare is eaten up in admistration costs, did you know this? How could anyone see this as being beneficial? We should get rid of the welfare system, get rid of the perks for indians and everything else, and begin teaching people to be independant, because this is the only way we will ever accomplish true equality. These people that rely on welfare have no idea what it feels like to succeed, they are diminished on a daily basis and are basically treated like dirt by everyone and forced to live in poverty where the crime rates are the highest, while being investgated and threatened by the government, the welfare office and social workers on a continuous basis. It is much easier to go to work than to deal with the welfare office, trust me. It is really terrible. As much as I feel blacks should be compensated for what happened to their ancestors, the truth is our country can't do it with out destroying itself economically. You have to see things realistically and get over the past so we can better the future for everyone. Education is the key, not government handouts. ;-)|`|LpEzlBQCaa	Well, considering that 90% of the American population is white, the highest group on welfar would naturally be whites. Only 10% make up the other races, so considering that, that's sure a lot of black people on welfare for that small 10% population that make up of in America compared to the 90% of white people.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	Source?<br>  <br>  Sorry, but those statistics imply the complete opposite.<br>  <br>  The percentage of whites and blacks on welfare are almost the same, with whites slightly higher. However, the number of whites in the country outnumber blacks by a factor greater than 5.<br>  <br>  That means that for every 1% of the white population on welfare there's more than 5% of the black population on welfare.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	Because Blacks generally live in a more concentrated area in the an area in the city. There are more people that see these areas as a negative stereotype... Many whites live in rural areas where it isn't by metropolitan people.   <br>  This is my theory... there is no research I know of that will support this.|`|tyuxbdrnaa	What statistics?<br>  Post your source, darlin.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  38.8 whites<br>  37.2 blacks<br>  WOW.<br>  Yeah that was  a huge margin, worth posting!

8RLGcshUaa	Well your asking a hard question! I think you are a little too much introverted. I am a little like that myself, but my cousin was very much like that. But with time, you might break out of that shell. Don't you feel lonely at all? My suggestion to you, is to see if your mom (dad) have any friends at work with people your age. They could invite their family over and you could get to know someone that way. You could fine someone at school that seems to hold themselves back as well, and try to strike up a conversation. I moved to a new highschool my junior year. I had no friends, and I decided to hit up a girl that nobody talked to. She is/was the best friend anyone could ever have asked for! I don't know how anyone woudln't want to be her best friend. And it turned out she was nothing like I thought her to be. Also, maybe you could go to a few school sporting events or functions. Or join a small club at your school where everyone has a common interest. I think if you try just a little, you might be surprised at where you will be! Good luck and I hope you find a date for prom! (High school is a weird part of life, everyone changes afterwards. You will not necessarily be the person you are right now in 5 years.  I promise it will more than likely be for the better!). :)|`|kqXQA2ILaa	being an introvert is cool.|`|A82eeFRXaa	ok, so here's the thing, a lot of people do not like high school.  A very great many of those whom I've spoke with (and me here included, in the opinion), have said that when they got to college they've experienced a completelly different way of life, education, etc.  Knowing this, that might give you some comfort.  I kind of wanted to go to Prom as well, but didnt.  I don't look back on it, or is there any regret.  It's just another thing that happened.  You can't do everything.  And knowing what it's for, how it's structured, well, what is prom celebrating?  Expensive costumes?  Hair well put.  Pairs dancing together.  A facade of happiness, music, etc.  Would you enjoy it, if it's not really your crowd?  Im sure that there are a lot of people feeling the same way you do.  What it takes is this will and energy to go and get to know them.  If you go to college, your life will be different.
6GmtcZteaa	Gift or a curse ? Ain't that a tough one to find out. I have similiar incidents. But I mostly HATE MY SELF for it. I don't know why I choose to see it as a curse. I guess it is because we would much rather let life take its own course without us interfeering. I think it scares us to know we can play an effect on the future. I think you have to spend time alone, concentrate on your feelings, rediscover yourself , find out about you more. because I think before you can see into the future...you have to see into your ownself. I suggest you have to put more faith in it before it comes back, and believe more in it. Try to view it is a gift that you can control whenever you choose to and not neccisarly a curse. Tell yourself you can do it and see. Use more imagination. try to be more creative. Find peace, make a routine for yourself - follow that simple routine for a couple of days. Make sure you dont meet alot of new people in that time-negativity might sometimes influence the clearance of these visions. Live simple. eat healthy, go to the gym. sleep early. Really these things are simple but youd be suprised on the changes they can do to our minds and selfes. Really. Try that. and be more creative and trust that you have this ability.<br>  P.s : When did you find out about this ?<br>  <br>  Edit : I know like you have lost a part of your persoanlity right.<br>  Like you were really dependent on it and now you don't know how to do without it. Well you just have to remember that alot of people live normal lifes. without this. and normal is living your life without depending on this. Then mabye it might come.

In order to fix a problem, you must first understand the cause, and even the most knowledgeable economics experts are baffled. Blame has been assigned to everything from greed, a godless economy, corruption in business and government, the production of bio fuels, the free market and deregulation, oil prices, and poor mortgage practices, to name just a few. <br>  <br>  We are confused because we are looking at symptoms, rather than causes. Until today, societies functioned by exploiting others for self gain. The rich took advantage of the poor; developed countries used the resources of the undeveloped world; the strong preyed on the weak. <br>  <br>  In today’s global world, all facets of society have become so intertwined that even the broadest political and cultural boundaries have become virtually meaningless. We have become a single entity called “humanity,” where each part depends on the health and proper functioning of all the other parts. <br>  <br>  Our best option is to dedicate ourselves to understanding and conforming to this new globalization and interdependence with positive communication and interaction with upholds all of us rather than just one part.. This will create a world of mutual caring for one another for the sake of everyone’s survival. By doing this we will discover vast reservoirs of untapped potential within and around us, thanks to the new and healthier connections between us. <br>  <br>  Here is a MAC vs PC parody about the better option which takes you to a more in depth video on what caused our economic crisis and how to remedy it.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jw9aVMtfQY&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jw9aVMtf...</a>|`|QqY8YgGDaa	If you want solution so as to help poor ,there are self employment without investments<br>  --You can read information written by yahoo answerers and you know how to write e mail messages to any answerer  here ,by clicking here in profile picture|`|mpfqoLCVaa	We need to prevent further leakages to our respective economies. Leakages to economies happen <br>  <br>  1)when people just save money without investing that money productively as to cause new employment and jobs. Investing in the secondary market, where shares are sold and purchased, does not create new employment. Such investment only affords liquidity to the share market through the stock exchange. <br>  <br>  2) When government collects taxes and does not spend the same for public welfare<br>  <br>  3) When Imports exceed the exports. As far as possible, we should stop outsourcing jobs to other countries.<br>  <br>  Thus if each country in the world looks towards tackling the aforesaid problems, Inshaallaah, the situation can be brought under control.|`|hfDohxp5aa	Your question is a bit like asking why a 16 yr old teenager is so messed up, it started when he was born.

I think self sufficiency is key to all these problems.  Do not you think we are stealing other people's jobs, maybe because of the money advantage and labor advantage. If our governments had taken step towards self sufficiency from the period of independence i do not think we would have had to face this problem.  Hai do you think currency will do everything.  It is food which matters.  Our people had been become lazy and mislead by imposing the idea that city life is much happier, people from poorer sections have been leaving the villages and now they are ultimately the sufferers, i know i am talking nonsense, but i felt like saying this.  Why are we depending on the other countries.  Is it because of the currency rate difference,  if our currency had been equal to theirs, do you think, our people will be depending much on other countries.  My idea is self sufficiency, then we do not had to think about financial crisis.  Hai people in india are very much interested in white collar jobs only, they are not interested to make their uniforms dirty,  i think if they change their attitude we can over come all these problems.|`|6eWA5TYyaa	People need to spend and banks need to loan money.  Right now people are worried about spending because they can lose their job at any moment and banks don't want to loan because most business show losses on their books.

It never is a good idea to zero in on the negatives and thinking whats the use am going to die anyways, as if you keep doing it, you have not lived, not have been happy and your life was a total waste.<br>  From what you say, i think you would benefit frm counsellings. They can teach you HOW TO HAVE A REASON TO BE, how to see an other human being, how to co-exist with others, helping each other be a better person<br>  In order to understand others, first of all you have to understand yourself, you have to belive in something, you have to create a meaning to your life|`|5333d46492264491fa413a6a461619f6aa	What plant do you just land from!

Qyue0Ykgaa	Blue eyes naturally turn grayish silver, however the dream would suggest that you are a spiritual person and like to daydream so to speak about having special powers sometimes. The L shaped room would suggest that you had a bond with someone in your life, and had how to say, gained immunity, invincibility to stay there, like no one can do anything to you, cuz you know its your dream, and you drew a picture of orange-red and aqua that would symbolize a leverage between hot and cold, possibly you were imagining a place where you are in the middle of two seasons, if you went with the white room, it would be snow land, and if you went in the green room it would be hot Forrest spring, and through that you may have felt that you are assigned by some sort of guardian angel to help people in your dream, like some sort of family that would help humanity, cool dream.

This is solely for the child.<br>  Instead of creating jobs to handle garnishments, I think it would be better used to find these run away dads to get the monetary support OWED to the child they fathered.<br>  <br>  As far as the economical crises we're in, people should quit living excessively and above their means.<br>  When I look back on my upbringing (my dad was Navy), I guess we didn't have a lot. But my mom was a homemaker. She was always there when we came home from school.<br>  Now a days, both parents work and kids are latch-key kids and pretty much get everything they want.<br>  <br>  So, no.<br>  People should learn not to buy what they can't afford or can't pay in full when the bill arrives.

a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	wow, so many people have been asking questions like this ever since that show first aired, but whatev, I wish I was just like them too. idk if social psych would be the best one to get into, although I recently asked a similar question and gave somebody the best answer who said social psych. but anyway, I think that since body language - since body language reading is the main premise of the show -  is an unconscious process, then cognitive psych would be the best one to get into because most cognitive processes are unconscious as well. Social psych focuses more on the psychology of social interaction and such. Clinical psychologist, however, often have to determine if somebody is lying or not, but that's probably just a skill they acquire over the long academic road to becoming a clinician. Cognitive psychology seems like the most logical answer to me. Please let me know if you find something different though; i'm really curious about the field myself.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I dunno, but i LOVE that show!

Listed below are many other types of agencies and settings. In all of these, in various sections of the country, persons with bachelor's degrees have found interesting and challenging positions which utilize their knowledge of psychology. <br>  <br>  Community Relations Officer: works either for business or government in promoting good relations with the local community. <br>  Affirmative Action Officer: works for recruitment and equal opportunities for minorities; employed by business, industries, schools and government. <br>  Recreation Worker: plans and supervises community recreation facilities. (Increasing number of opportunities available for therapeutic recreation workers, often requiring course work in therapeutic recreation.) <br>  Urban Planning Officer: deals with city planning, renewal. <br>  Personnel Administrator: works with employee relations, selection, promotions, etc. <br>  Advertising copywriter: researches audience and media, writes text of advertisements. <br>  Media Buyer: researches product and audiences to select most effective media for advertising. <br>  Health Educator: gives public information about health and disease. <br>  Vocational Rehabilitation: counsels persons with handicaps and illnesses in preparation for new vocations (some states require an M.A. degree for this position). <br>  Psychiatric Assistant: administers routine tests, helps with patients under supervision of psychiatrist. <br>  Director of Volunteer Service: responsible for volunteers--recruits, supervises, trains, and evaluates volunteers. <br>  Public Statistician: collects and interprets data on health and disease and community relations. <br>  Customs Inspector: serves at international borders and airports in investigations and inquiries. <br>  Probation and Parole Officer: persons with psychology backgrounds are often preferred for such positions, especially with adolescent parolees. <br>  Newspaper Reporter: social science, psychological interest areas. <br>  Technical Writer: researches and writes material dealing with social science and psychological knowledge for magazines, newspapers and journals. <br>  Sales Representative: major publishers of psychological books often seek out undergraduates with psychology majors for these positions on college campuses. <br>  Opinion Survey Researcher: does opinion polls and interprets results. <br>  Daycare Center Supervisor: supervises and coordinates activities of preschool children with working parents. <br>  Research Assistant: assists in the collection and analysis of data for major investigations. Positions usually available only in large hospitals, businesses, and government. <br>  Laboratory Assistant: psychology background preferred for students working with animal behavior research, especially primate laboratories. <br>  Scientific Instrument Salesperson: opportunities in sales and development for companies specializing in psychology apparatus. <br>  We have not listed the numerous kinds of "counselor" roles that are available to many students with a bachelor's degree in a variety of social work service and mental agencies. Opportunities of this type are most abundant in the inner city and rural areas. Usually you can find out about such opportunities through contacting your local community service agencies, e.g., half-way programs for alcoholic or drug addicts, former prisoners, former mental hospital inmates, and former institutionalized retardates. Many of these programs while they often times do not have much of future as a career, for a beginning post bachelor's position they can be quite challenging. <br>  <br>  I will site the source:<br>  <br>  psych.hanover.edu/handbook/bachpsy2.ht...

For example at night I think what if somebody reached their hand threw my window while I was sleeping and grabs me or what if I when I get on a freeway I accidently drive up on the side of the guardrail and go flying like hundred feet down off the highway. Maybe it is normal or we are just weirdos haha.|`|PX0yK5gkaa	i feel the same way|`|hZplqDPBaa	The first part states you have a super overactive imagination, are very negative, a worrywart, and think about things that aren't possible.  To this I would say you're insecure, possibly depressed, with a little self-sabotage going on.  I would also suggest you watch less TV and find something more constructive and positive to do with your fine brain.<br>  <br>  The second half states that you KNOW you do not have the mind of a "normal" person that you question everything about life and understand life more than others.  To this I would say questioning everything about life IS very normal - and questioning is how we learn.  Most folks don't pay that much attention to things outside themselves so you probably do understand life more than others.  Does your own intelligence frighten you?  <br>  <br>  You don't need help - you need to find people on your level.
dTVewWz8aa	I found it pretty useless. There was no clear direction throughout the course of my therapy -- I didn't feel like I was progressing towards anything. I was just encouraged to talk about what was bothering me at any particular point, while the therapist sat there and kept an eye on the clock, not actually doing anything except "empathizing". This approach was problematic because I already worry about my problems constantly, and the more I think about them, the more depressed and overwhelmed I feel. I also found it really irritating when I would talk about something that was upsetting me, and the therapist would say "it sounds like this situation is really bothering you". Like I wasn't acutely aware of that already... <br>  <br>  So to summarize,  I found PCT to be a frustrating experience because I am already aware of what my problems are, and being encouraged to focus on them every session without actually taking steps to change the situation made me feel worse. I was hoping to learn some coping skills or at least have some objective feedback about my situation, but it didn't happen.
NAGiNKFWaa	I have seen Conan on the Martha Stewart show several times, I think they live near each other.  He appears to be a very nice, social person.  I think some people behave one way when the camera is watching, and another way at home.  It is like your boss can be a real jerk at work, and yet be a very nice person when he gets home, and vice versa.  Jerry Seinfeld and his wife, Jessica, are very active in promoting healthy child nutrition, and I believe they also raise money for children's charities.  Jeff Foxworthy also raises money for Children's hospitals.|`|zZY3JX30aa	It's TV....it isn't real. It's "acting". If a child was up late enough to watch the show, one would hope they were intelligent enough to understand that it isn't what it seems. Not everyone is concerned with the examples they set, nor do they feel a responsibility or obligation to act, be or think the way other individuals would have them do.<br>  <br>  While there may be a setting to increase the brightness, which may not work as some would have it, there are other settings, such as a channel selector or power button that usually do work.<br>  <br>  Why is what a child watches the responsibility of the people on the TV and not the person that is raising them to control what they see and hear?<br>  <br>  <br>  Then I would suggest you read up on dysfunctional behavior and personalities; being a "clown" is often one of the "roles" they adopt growing up in a dysfunctional family
366b29cd4263cf59b2a3e76ffdd1674caa	ask him why he does this; is it something he cannot control? do you think he does it for attention?

Find bigger reasons to love him and yourself and you'll be much happier.|`|3405bffe0ffef8b148fdd01c607026daaa	Just rememeber that we all have our faults.

4wtLW9yTaa	Wow, only 4 hours left on this question.... I am glad I could take the time to read and hope you get my answer. <br>  <br>  I believe the answer to this matter is painfully simple, you need to believe in yourself.<br>  <br>  A lot of times in life people do not agree with the way we do things or the path we CHOOSE to walk on, but we must find our OWN way. It is an impossibility to please everyone. If we try to force ourselves into what only someone else wants then we have failed ourselves. Your sister and mother will be so proud to see you happy, even if they don't see your good intention. <br>  <br>  It sounds like they are also putting a lot of stress on you as a man in the family, and with the economy being this way money can make people very impatient and insensitive.

Great for mowing down zombies.<br>  <br>  A vehicle would be tough... It really depends on what the plan is for survival. I'm not going to go all out like I do for other zombie answers, but I'll say this...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1) If I'm planning to Stay where I am, a Venezuelan Guerrilla Warfare-modified APC with mounted machine-gun with spikes and barbed wire would be perfect for a stationary defense against zombies. This APC is similar to "La Rana" from Mercenaries 2. It doesn't sacrifice fuel efficiency for speed, and I don't need to get anywhere fast. Plus, if I can't get the zombies, at least the zombies can't get me.<br>  <br>  check the second from the right pic on this website.<br>  <a href="http://www.pandemicstudios.com/mercenaries/vehicles.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pandemicstudios.com/mercenari...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  2) My plan of choice, If I were to follow my planned zombie plan (simply heading from my house and heading to the mile-away walmart and use complicated fortifications, then migrating when low on backup supplies), I'd need a quick location-jumper to move between Guerella fortresses, one that could get there either relatively quickly, or slowly but safely... Most likely an armored SUV or Hummer with re-inforced steel windshield and removed-but-replaced-with-steel windows... That way, when I needed to migrate to a new base-of-operations, I could do so safely.<br>  <br>  3) If the plan were escape (which is pretty unrealistic... to where?), as hard as takeoff could be, I'd say a modified 4-man glider with a huge storage so I could glide in the sky and stay there as long as I had the supplies... Then, when I ran low, I could land outside a city, hunt for supplies with my fellow survivors, bring them back to the plane, and ship off again. Of course, we'd need to "clear" a runway of zombies before we shipped off...<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope you enjoyed reading... email me sometime and we could have some zombie-debates.   :)|`|YCUJMvWQaa	yeah but  what happens when you run out of ammo I'd use a sword and an axe and crazy weapons I'd go SPARTAn on their asses hah.  :)|`|6zFh04HTaa	Well me personally, my handgun of choice would be the Browning 13 chamber semi-automatic 9mm with explosive tip bullets.

5RZ5tfRYaa	This is called precognition -- <br>  <br>  "a form of extrasensory perception wherein a person is said to perceive information about places or events through paranormal means before they happen."<br>  <br>  Rather than having the dream, forgetting it, then being reminded of it several months later by the events in the dream taking place, it is more likely that you were overcome with a SENSE of the dream having happened, a feeling as though you remember (or in fact do "remember") having a similar or identical dream -- as a result of the current events being perceived incorrectly or being irregularly categorized in your memory.<br>  <br>  To determine the validity of your "precognition," you can try to write down every dream you have, the instant you wake up. As events occur, you can reference back to your cataloged and dated dream journal. <br>  <br>  If you can determine that you've genuinely predicted a future event through a dream, then you must also remember the distortion created by selection bias: <br>  <br>  "[...] the human memory naturally has a tendency to remember coincidences more often than other non-coincidences and thus individuals tend to remember more frequently when they were correct about a future event and forget the instances when they were wrong."<br>  <br>  People generally have 3 to 5 dreams every night, up to as many as 7. If you had 5 dreams every night for a year (1,825 dreams), it is not statistically unlikely to "pre-conceive" a single variable in an everyday event.<br>  <br>  Check out the links below, it's really interesting stuff!|`|87af67fae00282c9a730a508a8a5b528aa	Not surprising; it happens to me too.

You see our bodies act under the influence of chemicals. <br>  <br>  To make it understandable I will simplify it.<br>  <br>  Lets say you have only ten chemicals for happiness. One chemical is released and your happiness if of level one. Tenth chemical is released and you are fully happy.<br>  <br>  Similarly every action in our body is driven by chemicals(on the receptors). Think of your body as clock and every cog is a system/cycle of a particular type of chemical. Now if you know when one cog will move you know what the others will do and thus you can easily GUESS the movements of the hands.<br>  <br>  Now can't it be possible for God to MAP those chemicals and their cycles so as to guess the future, at the time of your birth? <br>  <br>  And why not show all the dreams at one single moment? Why wait and show them at different times? Could it be because a certain future of your's has become inevitable due to your's and rest of the universe's chemicals?<br>  <br>  It could be some kind of memory repetition but ask yourself, how is it that it gets SOO precise at times, because repetitions can't be that different from each other as they REPEAT.<br>  <br>  Test dreams.

I'm so proud of her.  She knows they're mean, usually believe they're beautiful but guys like them because they're easy.  My daughter is in her school theatre troop and she's been taking dancing lessons for 8 years.  Yes, she's probably considered a bookworm but she is involved in many committees and go out almost every week-end.  Nothing like parties but they love to watch movies and talk.  I used to be young and a bookworm and one day I met a girl who used to be in the popular crowd.  I thought she didn't even know who I was, we were in our 20's.  She stopped me and told me she wanted to talk to me.  She looked old and tired.  She told me:  You know, we used to make fun of you when I was young then I started drugs, had a baby, got married to the father, he cheated on me, we're divorced and I'm drinking and smoking.  Look at you, you look young and beautiful and I would give anything to be in your shoes.  I said that I never knew they were making fun of me and I didn't but I also told her that if she wanted, she was still young and she could turn things around.  She wasn't ugly, just tired and looked older because of her bad habits.  Well, I don't know if she changed but I know I'm glad I wasn't in the popular crowd.  Too many of them turned the wrong way.|`|OKKfyLnlaa	I think about this sometimes, and I think if you knew the answer and could bottle it up, you would be rich!<br>  <br>  I believe it starts with being attractive and works from there.  In my high school, the popular people were all athletes and decent students who also happened to be attractive.  I think if you are in the popular group and not attractive, you have to be the "funny one".  I bet the fat guy you speak of is the funny guy in the group, and I bet none of the girls actually date him, just hang out with him.<br>  <br>  I was "socially awkward" in my first years in high school, and later "popular" in high school, and the only thing that changed about me was my looks.  It is pretty shallow but true, b/c I think my basic personality did not change.  I was good at sports and was an excellent student, but apparently a late bloomer, because once senior year started I got asked out all the time.  The only thing that changed was my older, popular, much better looking brother sitting me down one day and telling me if I was going to visit him in college and go to college myself the next year, I was not going to do it looking like that!  He made me get a hair cut and made me start buying my clothes at Abercrombie and J Crew.  It really did seem like overnight I was invited to all the parties, dating the best looking guy, and I was voted the prom queen that spring.  It was totally shallow, and I knew it at the time and still giggle about it.  It is pretty sad what a little window dressing will do!  My conclusion is that in high school, looks matter the most.  Thankfully they don't matter as much after high school!!!|`|vV4svNCkaa	usually popular kids are extrovert meaning they are outgoing.  they love to hang with their friends play sports and such...i wouldn't really say "popular" but more like a cool personality. like their nice...but kind of bitchy...fun and yeah. <br>  oh and there can be "popular" guys that are druggies...<br>  and some "popular" girls are slutty...<br>  <br>  losers or social outcasts or whatever tend to be introvert...like shy and book worm type... they usually dont play sports and they just look awkward...they probably have an annoying personality or maybe their just gross...idk...

I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. - Mohandas K Gandhi<br>  <br>  <br>  Since the Russian revolution, the world has been broadly divided into the socialist and capitalist sphere. However, with the demise of the USSR, the communist ideology has been thrown in the ‘dustbin of history’ by many theorists- Francis Fukayama being the most prominent. However, evils of liberal hegemony are also coming to the forefront- increasing inequality in countries embracing capitalism, huge balance of trade deficits tying up developing countries to western corporations and WTO/IMF norms leading to crisis and bankruptcy in many countries. In such a scenario, Gandhi and his ideas on the economy are being hailed by many as the ‘Third Way’- a suitable compromise between the leftists and free marketeers that ought to suit all classes. However, if we scrutinise Gandhian attitudes towards economics, we find a lot of similarities with both liberalism and communism. For instance, through the Swadeshi Movement, Gandhi advocated rejection of western textile and home spinning of cotton for Indians- this amounts to very much left wing protectionism which Nehruvian India adopted for over 35 years until under Dr. Manmohan Singh, India began its journey to free market economics. On the other hand, Gandhi backed small and decentralised form of government which sided very much with Liberal views. This, however, was rejected by India ever since independence and a huge bureaucracy was established under Nehru, the brunt of which is still borne by India. Thus, Gandhi held a very idealist view of economic globalisation where states would be self sufficient on most accounts but mutually dependent on some. His view negated the cornerstone of the principle of succeeding in modern economics- rapid industrialisation. Self sufficiency can only be maintained by maintaining a competitive edge in today’s world of free market. Without unique selling points, domestic industries are bound to be overrun by a foreign competitor. Gandhi’s views rested on the principles of co-operation and understanding- today it’s more about competition and profit making. However, Gandhi’s desire to safeguard peasant rights seems valid even today, where one of the most heated debates on the WTO is between the US, EU and G20 led by India and Brazil about agricultural subsidies. <br>  <br>  <br>  A major part of Gandhi’s criticisms towards industrialisation was geared towards preserving India’s rich natural resources. As globalisation has progressed, so has the tendency to try and exploit every possible resource in the country to increase the GDP. Rapid deforestation has occurred through out the developing world and serious environmental hazards are faced by most developing countries today. Moreover, corporate power has undermined governmental efforts at curbing environmental loss, as the American withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol vividly depicted. However, conservation processes led by the UN and also at the national and even local level, are gradually gathering speed in the second phase of globalisation, i.e., whereby most of the evils of globalisation are now being questioned and checked. Gandhi is the precursor of the modern Green Movement. As early as 1970s, the Chipko Movement in northern India was a Gandhian movement aimed at stopping the mindless felling trees for industrial purposes. Related to this movement, is the issue of women’s role in society and Gandhian perspectives on this issue. Interestingly, women like Gauri and Ganga Devi were at the forefront of the Chipko Movement. Globally, women have come to the forefront of developments in a much greater proportion, although they remain highly under-represented in the legislatures of most democracies, despite now having universal suffrage and rights as men. In India itself, the Women’s Bill remains stuck in parliament to this day. Gandhi clearly defined the roles of men and women and defined women to be the dictator of domestic affairs while the man being the one to go out into the public sphere. This view has not only been overturned in the west, but also in India, whereby women are increasingly coming forward as equals of men in every sphere of life. <br>  <br>  One of the fields where Gandhian philosophy has been totally rejected is that of global spread of violence. Through out the post WWII period when globalisation was maturing, numerous conflicts outline the Cold War. To this day, bitter conflicts exist in numerous parts of the world, notable ones being in Africa, Middle East, Chechnya and Kashmir. Post 9/11 has also seen international terrorism coming to the global arena with new and hideous dedication towards violent means. This spread of violence can be directly linked to the globalisation process. The only consolation remains that non-violence in anti-globalisation move|`|AA10329469	Before it becomes a threat,I think we Indians shall buy all the major industries or have a major share in them,the world over.If there is no rival territory,where is the question of rivals being there?|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Okay, thanks for using a question/answer forum to state a pseudo-fact, now shut up and go to bed.|`|Ky5tMN3kaa	See this otherside.

Si no cuentas con una persona así, busca ayuda psicológica, un especialista nos puede ayudar a afrontar ciertas situaciones en las que no sabemos cómo hacerlo.<br>  Siempre que uno ve que no puede con los problemas, lo mejor es pedir ayuda, a quién quieras, a quién puedas, pero no dejes que la presión se vuelva un obstáculo para tu vida laboral y en otras áreas.<br>  Por este medio yo solo te puedo decir que trates de echarle ganas y no dejes que la situación empeore. No te des por vencido. Suerte.<br>  <br>  Que estés bien.<br>  ?Saludos?|`|WfocF5eTaa	Necesitas abordar la cuestión del trabajo con una actitud positiva. Probablemente estés tan predispuesto a las situaciones demasiado complicadas y a jefes difíciles, que terminas atrayendo esas situaciones. Se que puede sonar absurdo, pero pasa así. <br>  Como tu dices, las situaciones en el trabajo son difíciles en sí, por eso se necesita nuestra capacidad para resolver problemas y muchas veces bajo presión, pero una cosa es que sea arduo y otra que resulte ser siempre un martirio, al contrario, deberíamos sentirnos felices desempe?ando el trabajo que nos toca, pues por muy pesados que sea nosotros elegimos hacer eso, o no? Si no es tu caso quizá deberías buscar una actividad laboral diferente, con la que te sientas mas seguro, o que no te estreses tanto, porque no mencionas a qué te dedicas pero hay ciertos trabajos tan estresantes que no todo mundo tiene estómago para aguantarlos. Y eso no quiere decir que no tengas la capacidad de realizar satisfactoriamente tu actividad. Si de todas formas has de trabajar bajo presión, no te pongas nervioso. Con el tiempo tu reacción será mas rápida y tus decisiones mejores, pues a todo nos acostumbramos.<br>  Ahora que busques un nuevo empleo piensa que será el indicado para tí, que será en un ambiente cordial con un jefe estricto pero justo, que sabrá sacar partido de tu talento. Repitete a ti mismo eso con convicción. Te sorprenderá pues resulta!|`|a9pdNoGXaa	Piensa que todos pasamos por ese tipo de problemas laborales y otros también , la cuestión no es deprimirte , sino buscar la solución , o sea sino vas a tener dos problemas uno el faltan te de trabajo mas sumada la depresión .

Suerte|`|fgyLaSvsaa	Lo mas importante, es no perder la calma y la fe, recuerda q todos todos hemos pasado como tu bien lo dices una RACHA, seguramente eres una persona muy brillante e inteligente y quizá muchos jefes tengan miedo q les puedas quitar el trabajo y por eso actuan con temor, el temor q deben tener es la incompetencia no a la competencia, desafortunadamente tu has sido la consecuencia de las frustraciones y temores de otros, no pierdas la calma y emprende una lucha nuevamente para encontrar un trabajo estable que sobre todo te sientas bien, ya que si estas bien contigo mismo lo exteriorizaras en todo momento. Teniendo salud, q es el regalo mas preciado q Dios nos dió, lo demas va llegado. Tambien quizás necesites reforzar mas tu caracter y si defiendes tus ideas ante tus jefes tendras mejores resultados! ANIMO ANIMO Y RECUERDA Q ERES UNICO Y AUTENTICO, cuantas personas quisieran tener todo lo q tus has logrado o ser quien tu eres, recuerda q existen personas q padecen desgracias de salud, dinero y desamores q les desgracian la vida para siempre, tu no estas en esos casos, es una simple nube negra q no tarda en quitarse ok.

QXY34a7Laa	Apparently you want to be someone you're not...so lying in effect helps you to become that person despite yourself.|`|ToILKl6waa	I would think it gives you a sense of power and superiority with the people whom you are telling the lies too. Although it may make you feel good, this can become a bad habit quite quickly and I would advise you to stop while you can. Use mind discipline and restrict yourself from lying with rewards. Try starting small in your truths until you can gradually change completely in your dishonesty.|`|66T1uoOYaa	probably makes your life more interesting.<br>  to fix it try this:<br>  <br>  when someone asks you a question or you tell someone something really stop and think of what the honest answer or statement is. then actually say it to them instead of a lie, practice that.  it will be difficult at first but eventually it will be natural and the lying will be at a minimum|`|fQLeIAh1aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_liar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologica...</a><br>  <br>  Pseudologia fantastica, mythomania, or pathological lying<br>  <br>  My sister has the same problem.

cWxwHMQWaa	You sound like you're with an abusive, controlling, addict. <br>  <br>  None of these are good things.<br>  <br>  What makes you think you deserve it enough to stay? Did she convince you this is all you're worth or did you feel that way long before she came into your life?<br>  <br>  If you're unhappy, this a great sign. Emotional/psychological abuse is very real. From what you've said sounds like this is what the relationship is or at least has become. <br>  <br>  It's hard to get over it, but the fact that you're feeling badly is a good sign. This is a beginning for you, depends on you how long it will take, but most likely you're done with this woman, hopefully with this type of relationship overall. <br>  <br>  It's normal to blame yourself (wondering if you're a doormat, pushover, enabler, yaddayadda), it can be hard to put the blame where it belongs, and it's great to take responsibility for letting someone do this to you, but you need to try not to be too hard on yourself. There's usually a good reason why we 'let' this happen, and more often than not things began well and this abuse evolved so slowly over time with their manipulation that we don't even see it until it's pretty severe. <br>  <br>  Best luck, I'm almost sure you'll pull through this better off than when you got into it.

I don't think you're a doormat or a pushover.  To me, it seems like you're doing the right thing...you're just letting her get everything out of her system, and I would love to have a guy who listened to me (but I wouldn't complain as much as her).  Your wife just doesn't seem to want to take responsibility for anything and you have to hear about it.  Basically, she's treating you like crap and you're letting her.  Tell her what you just told us and if she doesn't want to hear about it, start thinking about marriage counseling, or divorce.<br>  <br>  Sorry about her.

But in other ways you need to stand up for yourself. You let her walk all over you, and you are afraid to be chastised so you keep your mouth shut. That needs to change. I'm not saying you should turn into a jerk or anything, but you don't have to put up with her crap and her sexism. Being a gentleman doesn't mean you have to put up with it!<br>  <br>  She treats you like crap, she is punitive, and she sounds like maybe she's got a bit of a drinking problem. It is time for you to find someone else, unless you really want to spend the rest of your life dealing with her drama.
wnb0EgaHaa	Imo, it's all a matter of perspective and belief.<br>  <br>  I think if a mentally stable, healthy adult has the intelligence,  self-awareness, and maturity to be able to make consensual decisions about sexuality, degradation is is in the eyes of the interpreter.<br>  <br>  It matters to people who have a misguided belief that their moral code is the only appropriate one, and it usually comes up as an issue when they feel the need to impose their code on others whose beliefs conflict with theirs.<br>  <br>  When those whose behavior they are attempting to control (for noble and benevolent reasons only, of course) thumb their noses at the attempt, then they resort to attempted social sanctions that can range from bad-mouthing to exclusion to actual laws.  <br>  <br>  It amuses me that in the year 2009, so many people are still mortified by women who have the audacity to say "I love sex" and choose to act accordingly, lol.  <br>  <br>  I think it still scares a lot of them.  <br>  Jeez...what the heck is the world coming to when they call a woman a **** and she responds with no hint of shame or remorse, lol?  Suddenly, they have no idea how to intimidate her and control her behavior. <br>  <br>  Reference the marriage and divorce section for a great bunch of examples...the number of other women who refer to women who have sex with someone they are not engaged or married to as sluts is fascinating...especially when the fact that the guy asking the question states that it is a casual relationship, and HIS role seems to not even raise a blip on their radar screens.   <br>   <br>  Sexuality is a natural inclination, and it involves power and control...<br>  Enough said.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	It's the same thing as when the authorities/judicial system implement the death penalty in the USA.<br>  It degrades everyone in the country.<br>  <br>  If a young girl willingly engages in risky behavior, takes drugs and sells her body she may feel OK but nevertheless she is degrading herself.<br>  <br>  If a woman allows herself to be treated badly etc she may not be aware that she is degrading herself such as when a naive gal gets pimped out.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	A very good point.  If its someone's own choice, is it objectifying?  Is it degrading?  If they're perfectly fine with it, does it debase them?  I agree that if the woman (or man) is fine and comfortable with what they're doing, then that's their choice.  Sure, we may not make that choice, but that doesn't mean everyone has to live to our personal standards.<br>  <br>  For example, a porn star.  Many will say the woman is objectifying herself, degrading herself, and generally making herself into nothing.  But some women and men are fine with it--comfortable with it--and its their choice.  Who are we to point fingers and say "You're BAD!"<br>  <br>  The same argument can even be made of BSM.  Someone who doesn't partake in that sort of sexuality might think its "degrading" but if all parties are consenting, how is their choice of sexuality degrading?  And by whose standards?|`|ToehkII4aa	as long as the woman or man is not feeling degraded by any action performed by them in public or in private we shouldnt judge the actions by our standards or the societies standards but only for the actions done in private or public by a person which when made known to people would bring their wrath on the doer or scare the doer by restraining them from repeating the (particular action) again can or should only be termed as degrading . Let some one like god be the judge of the actions of others and ours too.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	That's what I've always said.  Unless the individual feels degraded, whatever she is doing is not a degrading act.  Each person thinks differently and what one finds degrading, another might enjoy.  There's nothing degrading about sexuality, it's something natural that you can't control.|`|1wIek546aa	Sexuality and love, to me, are the few things that make us more than the base people we are. it's the opposite of degrading. nothing is more exalting than working for a partners happiness, a partner's pleasure.|`|1c6Jwbevaa	You are 100 percent correct, this has always been my argument.|`|3FFb4pENaa	big thumbs up for empoweref pornstars!!!!

In my religion/philosophy of Xiq-ism, we realize and promote the idea that wearing headbands is to have ultimate meaning.<br>  <br>  Personally, it bugs me whenever I see women today not wearing headbands.  It's sick to not wear a headband!  No one will ever respect, care, or give a chance to any woman who does not wear a handband.<br>  <br>  So, please, women.. stand up for your rights to wear handbands.  You're worthless if there's no headband on your head- a fact I'm just letting you know for your own good, as an insightful Xiq-ist.<br>  <br>  NOW-  If you meet a good friend one day, you can take your handband off then.  But you're messing up if you do it before then, since there's no possible way that it can be good to not wear a headband before that point.  Because it's just true.|`|zGQt7sAOaa	generally people say that when referring to a woman if she does something that may make women as a whole look bad. for example... if a girl sleeps with a bunch of men it may feel fine to her, but to other people it looks like they are giving a bad image to herself and all women. its not my opinion....its just what some people think.|`|jRnR2Vkcaa	wonderful question you rock. and you already know the answers that people will give.

If I had the body of a super model I would be showing it off too.  I wouldn't be a ware house manager.|`|OTT79NAtaa	Because society feels women as intellectually and socially impotent. Society doesn't respect women's decisions, and as a result any bad decision women make is ultimately rationalized and being the fault of someone else. <br>  <br>  Also, we are very aware of the forces which stand to create a dichotomy between 'good' and 'bad', 'acceptable' and 'degrading'. Women having sex with a high number of people crosses this line (through rationalization of a few different arguments- greatest of which being the reality that women often trade sex for social gain). [In example of pornography] The main idea here being that young, healthy minded women don't normally fancy having strange random use them sexually for profit on camera - and I think this stands as a valid assumption as most women even today seem averse to this type of activity, so if a woman is choosing to do it it means that she'll bypass her natural aversion and her integrity just to earn whatever it is the pornography is offering.<br>  <br>  Anything outside of the norm is going to either be considered extra positive or extra negative.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Strippers and Escorts will normally say that they are using men for money when the reality is they are being used as sex objects.<br>  <br>  It is a degrading and demeaning lifestyle and job - heck for that matter so is the life style and treatment of most models even if they are not the same type of sex object its how they are treated.<br>  <br>  Most women won't feel degraded at that moment they might feel bullied, used, mistreated and most commonly a sex object.<br>  <br>  Many understand that even if she does not think its degrading at the moment she will eventually - all things are fun and exciting for a little while.<br>  <br>  --ps there is no dignity left someone who is naked on a stage shaking it around for men to jack off to. It has nothing to do with individuality or intelligence but the fact that she wants to make money fast & quick and is willing to do almost anything to get it.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Depends on your motives. If you are being sluttish and offering yourself to whoever whenever, you're degrading your image to others, not necessarily yourself if you don't feel regret for it. If you're just very open and are looking to have fun and date around respectably, (as in, having sex within relationships, short or long term,) then it's not necessarily degrading. <br>  <br>  I hope that made sense.|`|HimBbU6caa	I have no problem with it as long as both parties are consenting, but there are situations where both parties are consenting from a physical standpoint, but one person is not consenting emotionally. I don't knock people who get into the S&M stuff. I just don't think it's cool if a person is just doing it because it makes the other person happy, and in doing so sacrifices his/her own comfort level. What's good about two people biting and peeing on each other and one person goes to bed felling like sh*t after it's all done? This goes for any sexual act, not just alternative forms of sex. I like giving and receiving oral. It's mandatory for me in a relationship. If the woman I am with is not enjoying it just as much as I do it's time for me to move on. I want her to be just as happy and comfortable as I am. There are plenty of people in sexual relationships who are naturally submissive, but it doesn't mean that they are enjoying what they are doing.<br>  <br>  If both people leave the episode feeling like they did what came naturally I say live and let live.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think I answered your question. If I didn't send me an email.
FEAua3dxaa	First off, I'm sorry about your experience.  It must have been very scary for you.<br>  <br>  I have a family member who had that experience and the guy killed himself while she was on the phone with him.  She felt at fault, too, but it wasn't.  No, it is not your fault.  He had emotional problems and didn't know how to handle it.  Threatening suicide was a way to manipulate to get what he thought he needed.  If you stayed with him, it would not have been a good situation for you or him.  And to answer your last question, to be honest, there would be a probability of that happening.|`|AA12027265	Hun, with a history like that, he clearly had severe mental illness issues. It's easy for anyone dealing with a suicide of someone they care about to find a reason to feel guilty, and probably everyone does, but try not to. It clearly comes down to his own issues. What he did, and had always been doing, is an abnormally extreme way to act out. aka mentally he was not stable.<br>  <br>  His family should have gotten him help when he first attempted something in front of his own mother.<br>  <br>  Unless he'd ever been harmful to you, I doubt he'd have taken you with him. Most suicides don't. Their actions are mostly a cry for help, but they don't always know how to communicate it in a way that their audience understands or knows how to respond.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	He was evil, trying to bring you down with him. If one has a religious outlook on it, he will now be burning in hell, feeling so much pain, burning endlessly, forever in this eternal, excruciating, damning pain.<br>  <br>  It was his fault, and his alone. Staying with him longer would have eventually caused insecurities between you and him, you could have gone out to a supermarket and you would have come home and he would have felt insecure. It would have ruined your life, would it not? His insecurities could have then gone on to make him violent or aggressive, and he could have adopted a "If I can't have you, no-one can" and turned on you, then killed himself.<br>  <br>  Believe me, in leaving him, you saved yourself. You must remember, YOU didn't end his life, HE did. And it was his choice. <br>  <br>  I'm pleased that a decent, life-loving person like yourself, didn't get physically hurt in all of this. I know you will be feeling guilty, but take comfort in the FACT that you have nothing, nothing whatsoever to feel guilty for, and you will get through this.|`|ByM5bvqsaa	After reading the additional details, he does seem to have mental illness based on his history. Don't be too hard on yourself.<br>  <br>  I was goin to say, if this was the first time it happened, then he probably is suffering from other things he not telling you about. I been through it. Suicide can be considered as the 'ultimate punishment' cause once they do it, there's no way you can get back at them. But at the same time, he really could be suffering from other issues somehow.|`|14UMdGF9aa	No it is clearly his own issues; mental illness. He may have tried to take you with him yes but he was probably projecting his own issues into your relationship. I am sorry you have had such s horrible experience but don't dwell on it move on and live life to the fullest.|`|iF2MJP98aa	Not true love.  Mental illness.

Ignore it all.. don't worry about why not to do things, how they could go wrong. Just live in the moment, and enjoy your teenage years.|`|vijGOcPCaa	I myself am not very confident, but i do know exactly what you mean. Its like the person you really could be is being held back. Not being confident is embedded into your personality, it will require a large change to get that personal confidence. I know its hard, but try to be more out going, like, don't be afraid to chime in to a conversation, it can be scary but really people are only afraid to do such things because they are scared of putting themselves out there. If you are more out going you will be more confident in yourself, because you will know you can cross that line.|`|cZSQFLaKaa	Ahhh! we r both 14, lmao. <br>  I achually dont know...haha. ill star ur question cuz i like returning favors :D

AA10023809	Victims assumed the gang was going to rob rather than kill them. <br>  After all, that's what drug addicts usually did.<br>  <br>  On top of that, there was psychology. Killers were worked up and on drugs, and victims were afraid. Talking about Devil would certainly scare a sufficiently devout Christian.

I get freaked out when the start speaking tongue.|`|IF9MAgjAaa	You have to face it, just put yourself in that situation and hear that song. It may really pain you, but you will realize that it's over and you won't see it as scary at all. I had a similar problem, only I've never been too afraid of getting hurt. But I have a pretty life consuming fear of death, and the song Helena by MCR literally made me feel like I was going to die... and it was horrific. It reminded me of my grandma who died of cancer, and the Pope who died at the time it came out.  But yeah, now I appreciate it for leading me to so many realisations. It really brought me back to reality at a time that I needed it most. Anyway, I wish I could relate more to your situation, but for some reason, everything I fear, I actually tend to appreciate... I am very weird. But yes, you just have to face it and bury all those sad memories. Music is very powerful, eh?|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	You should overcome it, until then don't listen to it.<br>  <br>  I was in an accident at an intersection and for a while after every time I went through a intersection (which is a lot!)

vT0Fjkgvaa	The timing of the dream could be a coincidence or it could be a sign for you.<br>  <br>  To dream of being bitten by a snake means you will have a period of struggle with unfortunate circumstances.<br>  <br>  With your grandmother being ill the dream might be alerting you to some possible problems inside your family.<br>  <br>  Watch over your mother and grandmother for the next few days.  You might be able to advert a small problem before it becomes a bigger problem.<br>  <br>  And your grandmother could use a prayer from you tonight.  She will know where it came from.

With her age, in worried that she is not eating the right foods, or maybe she is experiencing some other stress factors that happen around her, but overall the dream reminds you of your grandma because sick and trying to contact you to see you, and the snake, serpent represents the devil, with the venim portraying fear, overall the dream might want to say, that snakes are a sin to have..

Many people feel that way. This indicates there is a hole in your life that you are not filling. Objects and belongings can never truly satisfy someone. What satisfies is walking with Christ. I am most serious. I used to feel like you do, until I welcomed the Lord into my life. If you do have the Lord, and are still feeling that way... it seems like you are thinking too much about things. You have to be more secure and content about things.|`|uin3ffWDaa	your (hopefully) young and I'm assuming a female. a lot of these feelings are normal. i would suggest going to see your school counselor or a therapist and also getting involved in activities, sports and volunteering. the things will occupy your time and you'llll gain pride.  as a woman we all feel unhappy about our psychical appearance and is is very tough being a teenaged girl. my daughter is 13 and so beautiful and she thinks she is so fat and ugly. it's sad. but fortunately as you grow older you become more accepting of yourself.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	You're severely depressed.

You would hurt everybody that cares very deeply about you. I know there is someone who appreciates you out there, but you do not realize it yet.  Not eating right for a long time will make you feel like really bad and possibly wanting to kill yourself no matter who you are. The eating disorders can change but I sense it will be hard. What you can't change are people's minds. I would suggest hanging around friends that are supportive. they can tell you good things they see in you that you may have overlooked. I take it you are a girl who is constantly pressured to not be fat. Pardon me if I'm wrong. Given the 100 pounds and the 4'11, I looked at the body mass index and according to that, you are healthy and not fat. You would have to weigh 124 pounds to be considered fat. even without the BMI I do not believe you are fat. Please talk to your siblings, parents, or teachers about your eating disorder because they can help you more than I can. Life is not perfectly structured and the less you try to control it the better.<br>  <br>  I will leave with this; hoping I helped you in some way:<br>  <br>  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Hey slow down there chief.<br>  <br>  You need to just CHILL OUT.

Q9NHnC9Vaa	Hello, very interesting question!<br>  <br>  Those blind since birth or very early childhood have no visual imagery in their dreams. Instead, they experience a very high percentage of taste, smell, and touch sensations in their dreams.<br>  <br>  Blind people can only have auditory dreams. An "auditory dream" is a dream with only sounds and no images. Basically, the dreams of someone who’s been blind from birth are just like the dreams that you have - just without the pictures.<br>  <br>  People’s dreams are based on the things they experience in their lives. That is to say that in a way, our dreams are based on our memories. So a person who has never experienced "seeing" will not dream using sight.|`|AA12360662	Dreams come from subconscious mind.  We normal people see things in reality, in dream we project the same way we dream.  <br>  <br>  We see flower as beautiful, in dream we will project the same way.<br>  <br>  As for blind people, they will project the things they visualize as in reality.  If they think flowers are like plastic, so in their dreams, that is how they projected.  Basically, it is just a projection of their feel and life time experience.<br>  <br>  For example, if you never taste cheese, you will not know what it is like in  your mouth.  You may think it tastes like regular butter or bread.<br>  <br>  But once you have that experience, your projection, feeling or opinion of what it is will be total different.  Same goes with blind people and their dreams.

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	It's awkward at first if both of you are new to it. From my experience, it doesn't take long before it's second nature.  As to how you do it: when you are kissing someone who you think is a good kisser, just mimic what they're doing.  General rules are; don't open you mouth too much, avoid bumping your teeth into the other person's front teeth, and keep your spit in your own mouth as much as possible. (Not that french kissing is bad, it's just that some will drool down your face if they're not experienced.) Practice makes perfect!|`|a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	haha, nah don't worry about it, we've all been there! It doesn't rly come naturally at all.

After a little practice though, it becomes a lot of fun!! lol (same thing goes for sex, but that's another topic). Hope that helped, and happy kissing : )|`|MKOHaPktaa	It's a bit of both.

ToILKl6waa	First of all, understand that your body mass index is not at all overweight. You can always find motivation to exersize if you disagree, but I'm just informing you that your current standard weight is at an alright number. <br>  <br>  It seems that you are forgetting about all your fortune and thinking too much of your pain. Look in the mirror and stop feeling the urge to automatically pick at flaws. We all have them - it's a part of life. Accept yourself as you are and place emphasis on your good features. Wear your hair a different way, outline your eyes with mascara - whatever it takes to make you feel better about yourself. However, nobody is really judging you. They're all too preoccupied with their OWN flaws. Learn to believe that. <br>  <br>  If you say you're ugly, you'll feel that way. So why not let yourself know that you're beautiful the way you are? Look in the mirror and realize you're not so bad. As long as you have a big heart, no law in the book says everyone has to be a beauty pageant queen. <br>  <br>  Find confidence within yourself and make a list of a few things you are thankful for. Realize we live in a free generation and you are always in control. No human being can hurt you without your consent. Thus, if you have faith in yourself, nobody can take that away from you.

If the women taking the picture is being tasteful about how she dresses and takes the picture then there is usually not that many bad comments. But if the women is showing off how big her breast are by wearing a slutty shirt and shoving her **** in the camera then yes people are going to be nasty because in our society that is very unacceptable and kinda rude. Personally I would not want to have my younger kids seeing some woman shove her **** in the camera and post them on the internet.<br>  <br>  It seems like women are thinking my comment to be out of jealousy. It isn't. I have big breasts too. I know its hard to find the right sized shirt. I go into a store and only leave with 1 shirt after trying on like 20 just because what might fit me in the chest is too large in the mid section and a shirt that fits in the mid section is too small in the chest. The only difference between me and some of the other women on here is I don't flaunt them on the internet. This girl doesn't have big breasts but this is what I'm talking about when they purposely flaunt their chests.  <a href="http://earsucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/miley_cyrus_sucks1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://earsucker.com/wp-content/uploads/...</a> and <br>  <a href="http://tv.popcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/miley_cyrus_underwear.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://tv.popcrunch.com/wp-content/uploa...</a> But here are some big breasted women. This to me there is nothing wrong with this. I know its from a movie but some of her chest is showing but you will get the idea. <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/12/03/kidman.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/photos/u...</a>  and Oprah has larger breasts but she doesn't flaunt them in the camera.

8D3Rzz2Maa	Ah the age old question!<br>  <br>  Some people find it helpful to say "I am going to work on this for 15 (or 30) minutes and then I can take a break".

"I'm going to work on this for 2 hours and then I'm going to a movie."<br>  <br>  Sometimes just combating negative feelings "just do it" and taking deep breaths help. <br>  <br>  I make a list of things I need to get done and keep the list manageable and realistic.

Life is great!|`|qxJsxcQgaa	I am a recovering procrastinator myself and found the best way to stop procrastinating is to get more things to do.  That way you are always busy.  Procrastinating comes from just having 1 thing to do that you dont want to do.  If you have a hundred things to do, it procrastinating doesnt seem so bad.  When I was in college I was the biggest procrastinator in the world, but I found that was good because I did my best work under pressure.  I wrote a 25 page thesis in 1 day, and received the highest grade in the class.  Things like that prove to you that you are very productive with your time which encourages you more to do more stuff under pressure.  If you want to beat procrasination you have to set better habits for yourself.  A good book to read is called "The Tripping Point" which will help you improve in all areas and help you use your time more efficient and become a great leader.  I used to procrastinate all of my work, because teachers used to tell me "Don't procrastinate."  I would always show them with the best papers and the best grades, but would tell them how much time I spent on it after that.  Another good way to beat procrastination is to let it backfire on you one time and see what happens when you do not meet your deadlines.  That sucks.|`|NpzNHmCGaa	You just have to fight against your urge to procrastinate in my experience.

The problem is that people misuse these things.  For example, "lol" has a specific use: to indicate that something is VERY funny.  However, people use it more and more to simply be a period at the end of a sentence.  That makes it meaningless.<br>  <br>  Similarly, :) can be useful to show someone that you're joking.  But, when used simple because you like smiley faces... it loses its use.

How to handle guilt worry anger. What errors in thinking are. <br>  It taught me about how important what I eat is. I have eliminated caffeine and white sugar. I drink water (lots).

AA12351337	Depends on what you mean.<br>  Most bigger companies (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, ect.) are Equal Opportunity Employer's.  Meaning that they look at everyone's resume, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, ect.<br>  So, in a legal sense, if you and I have the exact same resume.  Same school's, same previous jobs, applying for the same position, all that, then we should both be given an interview and asked the same questions, give or take.  Then they have to depend on who does a better interview.<br>  But there are certain, special requirements for some jobs.<br>  For example, to work for the company like AMR (American Medical Response), which is a private ambulance company.  You need to be able to lift different amounts of weight for different times and different heights (the heaviest is 140lbs.).  I am not saying that women can't do that,  AMR has women employees who had to do that, but I know more men who can then women.<br>  Then there are the dumb employers who simply don't want to higher women.  They believe that women can't do the same jobs that men can, which is not true.  So in that same scenario that I gave above, with the same exact resumes.  The male would get the job regardless of how the interview goes, simply because he is male.  Which is wrong, and incredibly illegal.<br>  I don't know if this matter's, but in the Military, women are not aloud to do any direct combat jobs.  Such as Special Forces, Infantry, Tank Crewman, ect.  This isn't due to any superior, testosterone deal.  The Military has their reasons.  While I have been in the Army, I have had two superior female officers, all of whom I respected.  Not because I had to, because it was true, they knew what they were doing.  Plus, I was served under many female Non-Commissioned Officers, which I also respected, because they knew what they were doing it, and did it well.<br>  I gave a small thesis, but I hope I answered your question.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To Miss Bonnie Parker:  Yes ma'am. The US Military does not have direct combat roles open to women.  Due to certain reason.  I don't know the EXACT reason's, so I don't want to list any and be incorrect.  But they do not have any mind set that women don't have an inability to do it.   For instance, females are aloud to be a Transport Specialist, which often sees more combat then some Direct Combat Jobs.  And women do very well in that job.  Do not reference me on this, but I also believe they are aloud to Combat Medics, which perform the exact same duties as an Infantrymen until a fellow soldier is injured.  Then they revert to being a medic to take care of the wounded soldier.|`|UDl8Ac76aa	Discrimination.<br>  Obstacles : Age, Status, Face, Sex<br>  I really hate it one condition in my country where the man rules.

I ask him to do it one way (the way the client wants it) and he tries to bully me into just leaving it the way it is or doing it his way.

But from what I read, there is some fear involved.  It is fear of lack of control.  In other words, there may be something in his life that he is losing control.

Ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life.  <br>  <br>  To dream of your own death, indicates a transitional phase in your life. You are becoming more enlightened or spiritual. Alternatively, you are trying desperately to escape the demands of your daily life.<br>  <br>  To see your dead sibling, relative, or friend alive in your dream, indicates that you miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them.

I don't intend to hurt anyone's feelings, but it's baloney. <br>  <br>  That fairy tale was "invented" and written in a book by a preacher in England many decades ago, and it made its way into a few religions in other areas, like North America.<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is that Native Americans came across the Baring Strait from Asia. <br>  <br>  So, Native Americans tend to have Asian features like high cheek bones, olive skin, and straight, thick black hair on their heads but little other body hair. Many also have almond eyes with single eyelids.<br>  <br>  The routes different peoples took as they traveled out of the cradle of civilization and spread throughout the earth is recorded in our DNA.

LbbawO7naa	Because your dream is centered around "unfair" jurisdiction, it could be interpreted as a mirror of your feelings. Authority figures in dreams often mean that you are searching for something in yourself thats wrong or right. They also signify a figure in your life that you fear, want to obey, or have control over you.     So knowing that I think that your dream is telling you that something in your life is not at justice... You may strongly think that things are weighed towards one side, and an event taking place is unfair. The reason that you are a child is because you feel that this lack of justice is out of your control, and you have no say in it.

Come up with a joke YOU like, a story, an intriguing thought, something that interests you, commentary on what's going on in the news, whatever. Bring that up in conversation the next time.    Have an opinion!    Don't worry about their childish jokes. So what if you don't like them? It's not all about you, anyway. They're having fun, and you can come off like a self-important snob.

2GNFQPdmaa	Look at the inflation numbers, the trade numbers, and the unemployment numbers. This isn't a depression at all. Investments tanked pretty bad, but the economy is relatively healthy in the fundamentals (considering it's in recession)<br>  <br>  That being said, borrowers and lenders had incentives to make some really bad decisions, leading to consumers taking on more debt than they should and banks being way overexposed. That's what happened.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Mostly, we are.<br>  When the public was promised pie in the sky 30 years back, few thought to question "how" all the good stuff was going to be paid for. I think it began when the economy went from "goods" to services. I wondered back then what would happen if we hit hard times. "Services" are the first thing to take a hit when people need to be more frugal. <br>  <br>  "Never happen." was the answer.<br>  Then companies decided to become "lean and mean". They downsized. Then they outsourced. People lost their jobs, but used credit to stay afloat.  You were "negative" if you pointed out that no one could live like that forever. Our parents generation regarded debt as a disaster, and tended to save to buy what they needed.<br>  <br>  We got into easy credit. Why wait, when you could have it now?<br>  <br>  Save? Well...some day maybe. <br>  <br>  We were told that "business" was the way to go, and think, even as the jobs were becoming more scarce. People talked about "a comfortable level" of debt. Homes went through a housing boom---and in just a few years, even the most basic home was out  of the reach of most families. <br>  <br>  Then came ARM's, and designer loans with no money down.<br>  <br>  Don't worry---we'll get you the home of your dreams...but that didn't mean you could afford to KEEP it.<br>  <br>  What killed the economy? People not being responsible. People assuming that no matter what the numbers said, they could have everything. Everything in our economy balanced itself on the house of cards that real estate had become. Companies stopped worrying about the product they were supposed to be making...and lined up to cash in on all that high rate paper.<br>  <br>  Foreclosures started...then picked up steam. Not just the poor--but the middle class...and even the upper middle class.<br>  <br>  And then, Wall Street went bust. All those companies that spent their money speculating suddenly came up short. <br>  <br>  <br>  There were other factors...but i think that's a pretty good sketch.<br>  What killed the economy was the simple fact that the market had been artificially stimulated for years...and gravity works...even on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  God help us...for not caring.|`|4t2kd03Waa	They would have you believe it is mortgages.

The manipulation of the real estate market by the greed of banks, corruption of congress. C.D.O.'s sold without the foresight of the SEC or the FED.

It is because there are others that persuades their friend to use drugs just to let them in their circle, or join their group.

Too many people who have become parents are too busy, just dont care enough, were not loved themselves as children, etc and they never make certian that even the basics I've mentioned here are imputed and understood by their children. And because this is true many American parents today, people grow up feeling unloved, unimportant, lost, depressed and mostly they end up with low self esteem and they just want to be happy and feel better even if it's only temperary and this is the perfect breeding ground to grow a very addicted mind. So I'll say low self esteem due to bad parenting is what is responsible for why kids take drugs even when they know full well about any and all reprocussions which could and do follow.OKbye|`|e7uUfLsqaa	In my opinion, stress!!!!

As human beings we battle the demons in our heads every second of the day, the fact that the philosophy of materialism ignores the reality of human nature blinds us to all the good things that we already have.

6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	We had a much bigger debt as a fraction of GDP after wwII but 20 years of responsible government where the economy grew and the debt shrank  reduced to to easily manageable levels. <a href="http://zfacts.com/p/318.html" rel="nofollow">http://zfacts.com/p/318.html</a>|`|AA10700486	The U.S. national debt will most certainly never be paid off -- and that's actually OK, it can be maintained forever. Individual people should pay off their debts at some point, because they can only generate income for 40 years or so, and they die; but nations are quite different. A more optimal scenario is for the debt to be kept relatively stable as the size of the U.S. economy grows relative to it.<br>  <br>  The stimulus package certainly adds to the debt. But with or without the stimulus, sooner or later the economy will be growing again, and as long as the economy grows faster than the debt, we're OK.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	The national debt comes from deficit spending, so the stimulus package will actually make it worse. That's the bad news.<br>  <br>  The good news it that the national debt never really "comes due." Paying it down might be a really good idea, but it's not, strictly speaking, necessary. It's also not actually possible unless the national budget is in surplus, and it's going to be a long time before we have that again.|`|biPiIIeMaa	The part nobody ever hears is that we haven't (yet) passed up the severity of the 9/11 economic crisis, and there's still a very long way to stoop down to before it would be similar to the Great Depression. The Stimulus Packages are arguably the worst wastes of federal money to ever be issued since the destination is often not revealed, and the part that is has a tendancy to be greedily wasted, so I don't think the new one will be any different.<br>  <br>  "Experts" say that the debt imposed by these stimulus packages will take until the current generation of highschoolers are in their seventies and eighties before it would be paid off.<br>  <br>  I don't think it will be as bad as the great depression on a relative scale, but the way the new administration is handling things, I imagine that it has yet to reach its peak, and until they get their act together and stop their power struggle, it isn't going to even start to get better.<br>  <br>  And since the US has almost 3/4 of the world relying on it for business, many nations, most notably China, Saudi Arabia and Russia are suffering just as bad if not worse due to the significant loss of business they've had- Russia and Arabia aren't making enough money from their fuel exports due to low costs, and the disposable-item market of China is failing miserably now that people are prefering things that will last a long time as opposed to something they have to keep replacing in vast quantities, because it's cheaper in the long run to buy a digital camera and use it for ten or more years than it is to continually buy disposable cameras for the same time period.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	In 2008, the US government paid $412 billion in interest on this $10.7 trillion National Debt.  And these interest payments will only escalate as the debt gets bigger and bigger.<br>  <br>  For now, the US government is borrowing money to make these interest payments.  Which makes the National Debt increase even faster.  <br>  <br>  There is a limit to how much money the US government can borrow from domestic and international investors.  People don't have an infinite amount of money to lend to the government or to anyone else.  And when they stop lending, then the interest rates on US government bonds will go up a lot.  And the US government will have to raise taxes a lot.  Because the US government won't be able to borrow enough money for the interest payments and for government spending deficits.  <br>  <br>  Nobody knows when this time will come.  But the National Debt is getting larger.  The interest payments are becoming bigger.  And someday this day of reckoning will come.  Which will probably lead to a real economic depression in USA.  Because raising taxes a lot will be very bad for the economy.

1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	I have to say a lot of it is in your head, withdrawals don't have to be like a stereotype if you are truly determined then it doesn't have to be evil, the worse thing is to do it because someone expects it of you, it is possible to just grow out of using it but if you believe it is going to be hard and you believe what everybody tells you -- OMG It's going to be f---ing hard! then it probably will be, you are already setting yourself up for failure by expecting mood swings.  <br>  My main advice is lose any so-called friends, don't swap drugs, don't be looking for, or expect, a pat on the back from anyone, recognise your moods and identify why you are in that mood, because starting arguments for no reason gives you an excuse to say f--k it whats the point!, do not get complacent and think, "I've cracked this" because that is the kiss of death.<br>  Other than that, best of luck!|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	doctor and keeping bloodsugar even.|`|iY8YNaDhaa	You need to find a vitamin called L-tyrosine. It will be the most important vitamin you will ever come to know.<br>  <br>  L-tyrosine is an amino acid that is a percursor to dopamine. A percursor means that when you take L-tyrosine, it is converted to dopamine in your body. As you may know, dopamine is the chemical in your brain which regulates your mood and feeling of well being.<br>  <br>  When you take speed or any other amphetamine, amptetamine in your system mimics dopamine in the brain, thus triggering the release or more dopamine. This is why you feel so happy when you get high, it is because of these increased dopamine levels.<br>  <br>  The mood swings afterwards are from a severe lack of dopamine (because you released all of your dopamine storage).<br>  <br>  Think of your dopamine storage like a gas tank. You have mood swings and drug cravings when your gas tank is low.<br>  <br>  Fill up your dpamine tank in your brain by taking L-tyrosine. I usually have 1000-500mg per day for 3 days after I take amphetamines. No comedown, no mood swings.<br>  <br>  Be careful though....having no comedown can easily become a free ticket to take as much speed as you want without any bad side effects.|`|AA12249359	The best way is to see a doctor and ask for their help.

NAGiNKFWaa	Well if I am in a conversation with someone, I maintain eye contact.  I don't usually maintain eye contact with a teacher, because I am usually taking notes.  I would certainly pay attention to the teacher, but not necessarily maintain eye contact.  I would hold the eye contact as much as possible, but if things are bothering you, I would think it would be acceptable to look away.  Good luck with your allergies, I know how that feels.|`|d6CEZW7oaa	Nobody but you has eye contact with the teacher.  That is why the teacher stares at you.  And you want to look away in order to keep the teacher from embarrassing himself when he realizes that you are the only person listening.  That or you are faking that you are listening and you don't want to get caught with a lie in your eyes.<br>  <br>  Everybody has allergies, stop making excuses.
SJx9IWWtaa	I'd say because we bottle it up to long.  We'll bat around an idea in our head, "should we talk about it" , "Am I overreacting" etc.  Finally it builds up, and we HAVE to talk about it.  Right then, not later.  Sometimes it just happens to be bad timing lol.|`|svOneExjaa	LOL. Because we refuse to live our lives on your schedule.

The truth is, this is a good way to test whether you think we are (as) important or not. It also sets the tone for the rest of the conversation. Try it if you don't believe me. Maybe I'm just old and have seen this so many times before. Turn that TV off when she says that and see how shocked she'll be. The conversation may still be serious, but you are ranking at this point.

About two weeks after we broke up she was with someone else and i was utterly disgusted with her. so i told her not to talk to me at all, whatsoever no matter what the condition or subject she needed to talk to me about. i wouldnt listen. during this period of isolationism, not just from her but from everyone as well, i had dreams about her and constantly thought of her. then things cooled down a bit and we talked but it was always awkward. it has been two months and she was with someone new and i didnt care. but i still had dreams about her. at that point i didnt really care who it was, i just wanted someone to love. but turns out i wanted it to be someone i could love passionately so i became picky with the girls. no relationship had even lifted off the ground or started after her.<br>  <br>  so i guess that's what it is. you WANT love. maybe you need it. but you dont want it to be your ex. like maybe you just cant or wont give her a second chance. hehe...|`|qPoN6g6zaa	follow wat ur heart sayz u just might pick da one|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	You really love her and you are scared that you will loose her, even for an x, you adore her, and jealousy gets the best of you in your dreams, she brings two friend with her into the attic, that's jealousy factor and your mind is trying to decide, weather to pursue her, or let her go on because your mind thinks she will just go to waste.. one bf then another, then the third.. then she will want you back but you would feel a hole in your heart because you wouldn't want her back because she had this obsession with her x,.<br>  <br>  The dream is saying, that because she broke up with her x and lied to you about seeking him, in the future she may break up again and again, and be used and abused, and your mind wants to sympathize and protect that dream from happening and remind you that if you let her go this may happen.|`|j4ro9GTvaa	Dreams are almost always difficult to analyze, especially if you try to connect a greater meaning to them.<br>  <br>  But basically, I believe that all of what's happened to you lately has taken a toll on you emotionally. Maybe you think you are ready for another relationship, but your heart isn't. This causes a conflict between your brain and your heart, which leads to these dreams you have been having.<br>  So yeah, maybe you don't want to get back with your ex, but it seems that your heart is trying to tell you something.
