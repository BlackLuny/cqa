20090205124606AAJECx6	Social Science;Psychology	How can I wake up??????????	I can't seem to wake up in the mornings.  I stay in bed until around 1:00pm.  Sometimes I wake up, but I just don't want to get out of bed.  I don't want to face the world.  It's sort of like a symptom of depression, but I don't think I'm depressed.  I have to go to class, I need to.  But I can't make myself do it.  Instead I prefer the comfort of my bed.  If they were later, then maybe I would wake up and go.  But for some reason I just don't want to start the day.

20090205124758AA3Ega2	Social Science;Economics	What contributes to the decision?	A headmaster makes, when deciding to close her/his school for weather conditions? I mean, with this snow, the main factors presumably are:      Health and Safety for children in the school and the ability for the majority of teachers and pupils to safely and easily travel to school?      Are there any other factors they must consider, or that may cause them to alter their decision?
20090205125205AA61PA2	Social Science;Psychology	Women as sex objects, what do you think of this thought?	Guys often demean women they find sexually attractive. Could this be because they're afraid of being in a situation they're not in control? Sex is foremost in the minds of most guys, and is a need--maybe they don't like the amount of power this gives women over them, and so feel the need to objectify women.   Just a convoluted thought. Feel free to give your opinion!   (Also, this doesn't apply to all men, just some.)

You're thinking that I'm just some ***** who is going to preach about my problems to everyone, but seriously, I need an answer.   I am in love with my friend. Yes, she is a girl. But she is in love with my other friend, and I've been trying to do everything I can to prove myself to her. She told me she liked me, but she liked my friend more. Anyway, all this time I've been telling my other friend (Andrew) that I was in love with her, but now he tells me he loves me. So I put him through everything that I was going through. The whole problem-I love my friend, not Andrew. What am I supposed to tell him, and what am I supposed to tell her? I'm not asking for a therapist, I want answers. I can't think of anything that I could do that would not hurt anybody's feelings.

20090205131001AAjxXkR	Social Science;Psychology	What is the best dream you've ever had?	one of the best dreams I've had I like to call my "Es" dream      I was walking all by myself down this empty road where there are houses lined on either side, the weather is overcast.  I don't know what I'm doing, but I seem to be looking for something, although I'm yet to find out what it is.  I come to this certain white 2-story house and I stop.  An unfamiliar boy with dark slightly messy, gelled hair walks down the driveway and meets me at the end.  We walk all the way back the road the way I came, in complete silence.   All of a sudden, we are immediately at my school,  there is music playing.  We walk in a back door and see people dancing in the hallways, no teachers are there, for it is not in school hours.  "Es" and I begin to slow dance together.  (I am unsure of his name, but I feel like it starts with an S sound, so I named him Es) We dance for a while, then a lady with dark hair matching his walks in the hallway in which everyone is dancing.  Es looks over at the lady and I speak for the first time asking "Who is that?"  He answers, also speaking for the first time saying "that is my mother" I ask "one more dance?"    We dance again for only a few seconds, then he suddenly lifts me into the air spinning me around and around, all I see is him.  He slowly brings me back down, kissing me in the process.  I am so dizzy that when I look for him to say goodbye he is gone.   I run outside as fast as possible, my legs taking me to the playground, where I see two of my semi-friends, I scream at one of the girls, "YOU MISSED IT, YOU MISSED IT!"  "missed what?" she asks "my kiss! my very first kiss, and you missed it!!!!!!!"  I say.  "With who?"  she shoots back, "I don't know......."  I answer.      so tell me some of you favorite dreams!

20090205133720AAG9tXF	Social Science;Psychology	What should I do about being wide awake in the middle of the night?	Hi. I usually try to go to bed anywhere between 9 and 11 but I usually end up going to bed around 10. On some nights I seem to wake up at 2 or 3 am. Maybe even 4. Now I haven't really come to the conclusion (yet) of whether or not this is related to the time I go to bed at night. Once in a blue moon I might go to bed about 8 or 8:30 depending on my mood. What I'm wondering is this; is it better to just get up and start going about my day since I'm already wide awake? Or is it better if I just try and force myself asleep? Though I did notice that if I do force myself back to sleep it is much harder for me to wake up in the morning to start my routine.

20090205135422AAhnoBe	Social Science;Psychology	Why are some people so oblivious to how rude they are?	Then again, maybe they know it, and they just don't care or they enjoy it.    I work with a fellow who spends all day belching, passing gas, clearing his throat, humming, and whistling. I've politely pointed out to him that it is distracting, and that co-workers and customers alike find it to be rude.    He says, "I am not aware that I am doing it," or he just smiles and shrugs and keeps on doing it.     I suppose it could be justified if he had Tourette's or some sort of other disorder, but the reality is that he has no actual condition. He just chooses to be that way, and sees no reason to change.    Why are there so many people like that, who have the attitude of "I'll do what I like, and too bad if you don't care for it."?

20090205140247AASZ5Tw	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I care about this kid...i hate him...?	I hate this kid on the bus...a freshman at my highschool. He is arrogant and cocky...Thinks he is great at skating but he really isnt from what I hear...I cant judge since I dont skate.            The kid was running up the hill to the bus this morning and dropped. This kid has seizures hes had one on the bus before in which I and another kid ran a mile to tell the bus driver what street we were on so she could contact 911.  So he was running up the hill and dropped. I and another kid I know hopped off the bus whilst the bus drove down the hill to get the kids parents. I dont get why I (I hate him) always help when his friends never do...He was slamming his head against the concrete so I took off my thick winter jacket folded it up and put it under his head to try to cushion the impact. I then spent the next 5 minutes trying to snap him back into consciousness which he did several times before he began convulsing again.                 I dont know why I care...or why the ones that like him never volunteer....

And they used a old material where nothing but dentist bleach can remove those stains. The rest are average white. I try to stand there and hope I go unnoticed. I typically only speak when spoken to. I went to a club with some friends, everyone danced but me. I played pool instead because I was afraid of how people would judge my dancing. For extra I just turned 20 and am a male. I honestly don't know for sure if i'm comfortable with myself or not. Is there anyway to get over there? Am open to any helpful suggestions.

20090205150259AAYkVa1	Social Science;Psychology	I push people away... why?	I am an immensely deep person and I am trying to get to the honest truth of what and who I am, whatever that might be. I have realised that I push the people I love/ like away. I pushed my old best friend away who was a girl, or at least I think I did and now I feel like I am pushing my other best mate away also. On one level I am sad about it but I also kind of want them out of my life and I have no idea why. I think it could be insecurity because I have trouble letting people go and maybe letting them go on my terms  is better than them leaving randomly. Help??    The other thing is I'm nineteen and still a virgin and I think its out of choice.. I have been with plenty of girls, naked pulling and more 1,2,3  but I  feel wrong to go to sex so I don't. Usually annoying the girl in the process. I think its because I want something more, like a relationship instead of just sex or meaningless s%^t (no I definitely am not gay) - a year ago I was with a girl I really fancied for ages we got naked and did things but then I just stopped because I didn't want to go further.... she had a boyfriend at the time and I guess part of me says I am an idiot (a big part) and part of me says I am being knightly. What the hell is wrong with me??? If you can work this one out cheers, you are a legend.   x

20061227030921AAbI84j	Social Science;Psychology	If your head is several inches larger in diameter than normal, is there any way to ever reduce it's size?	The reason I pose this question is that it seems that no one thinks a large head is aesthetically appealing, and/or misaligned facial features or misshapen bone structuring.  I believe the oversize head would fall under the improper bone structure indexing for current societal standards.  Isn't it funny that all 'ugly' people (per se) are still hard-wired to be attracted to 'beautiful' people.  Why do we automatically find certain configurations of facial features and certain shapes of bone structures to be more appealing than others?  Is it because we are instinctual - no more than a higher form of animal life?  Because going through one's entire life being environmentally conditioned to feel that one is 'ugly' seems to result in one resorting to desperate measures such as illicit drug use, wherein one finds oblivion's sweet relief.  But is such a damaging escape necessary?  Can one slice open ones scalp square by square and use a body grinder or angle grinder to reduce skull size?

20090205151900AAFG7qX	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream about a relative who recently died?	My husband's brother died unexpectedly (heart attack) on Friday he was only in his mid 40's. Sunday morning I had a dream that my husband, his other brother, my in-laws and myself went to his apartment for the weekend.       The reason we went to spend the weekend @ his place was so we could explain to him that he died. He was there w/us flesh and blood (so to speak) he wasn't an image or 'ghost like'. He was acting very normal not upset, angry or any other emotion. After spending some time there I finally asked my father-in-law if anything has been said to him yet? He answered me by opening the front door and showing me 3 garbage bags full of clothes and he told me that my other brother-in-law convinced him  to 'get rid' of old clothes he did not want anymore. I understood it to mean that they(we) were slowing easing into telling him that he died.       I spoke to him about 'regular' stuff and realized that he honestly had no idea he was no longer alive. I wasn't scared in the dream just really 'sad' and 'concerned' that he continued to go about his 'life' totally oblivous of his situation.       On Monday he was cremated, when I woke up Tuesday morning the 'dream' was on my mind and bothering me all day. (Which was day my husband, other brother-in-law and father-in-law went to clean his apt. out) if that means anything.      It's been bothering me a little on and off since then, so I'm just curious is this just my way of dealing w/this (losing my mind) or something else?       I don't usually pay any attention to my dreams but this one bothered me enough to have to ask.

20090205143529AALIxc2	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I feel this way? Is it normal?	Ok, we'll call her "Girl X". So a little while ago, I spent a weekend with Girl X and another friend. We had so much fun, (I knew both these people from high school) and I had always kind of had Girl X in the back of my head. But now, the girls I used to be interested in might as well be guys. I can only think about Girl X and I constantly fantasize about what my life would be like with her, I dream about her and think about her in class, and at my job. What is this? Girl X and I are both in college, but our colleges are like 300 miles apart. She has a boyfriend, but it's not serious, so I'm hoping she'll break up with him by summer, and maybe I can make my move?? I wouldn't mind driving to her college during the weekends. What is my problem though? If she doesn't break up with her boyfriend, I'm going to be doomed, haha. Is this normal? Or what? Has this ever happened to you?
20090205145305AAr2U8e	Social Science;Psychology	Is there anyone with an ENFP personality type?	My personality type is ENFP and apparently only 4% of people in the U.S. have it.

20090205144522AAjxNrU	Social Science;Psychology	Loving who you are and being yourself?	Usually, under this topic would be a lecture on body size, shape or colour and how to love whichever of these nature allocated you.      There however is actually more to who we are than the physical, and when you think hard about it, it is almost as hectic dealing with, or even more, as the physical aspect.      Take our inner selves for instance. There are battles raging in most of us when we doubt how good a person we are intellectually, emotionally and personality wise.      Aren’t there times when you have for instance wondered whether maybe you are too boring? Or whether you talk too much? But so what; aren’t there times when you also marvel, or even get irritated, at how talkative or quiet the other people are?      By nature, there is always the urge to fit in with other people; it is what is called peer pressure. You can not escape it no matter where you go or how popular and well liked you may be, you at one time do face the pressure of wanting to be just like everyone else. I have however come to learn that what really matters is how you feel about being you.      What is the use of sulking away with all the introverts at home on a good Saturday night when I would rather be out making friends and screaming my voice hoarse? When I wake up the next day, it is what makes me happy- that I met someone new, hit a new joint and wobbled back to my bed almost dead. As long as it does not kill me and I can regulate it so it does not disrupt the rest of my life, it is who I am and who I want to be.      I am no good trying to be just like my calmer more collected sister who would rather read a book or watch a movie whenever she gets a free night, if the next morning I will wake up sad and empty regretting the wasted Saturday I never hooked up with friends.      Each one of us is different and there is beauty in that; it is the blend of all of us that makes the world the beautiful place that it is. Just how boring the world would be if there was no use for the hangouts and parties or music because all human kind would rather dwell in silence! Or how noisy if all preferred roof toppling music sounds all day long! There is a bit of everything, however, you cannot be everything; you are either one or the other.      True, there is the pressure to want to fit in with the rest, but I say it is a futile struggle always. After all, you shall continue to change circles and therefore meet new people; if you ask me, you are better off being the one person that you are, and loving that person. Either that or you will spend your whole life fighting to be the next impressive person.       It takes time for one to learn who they are, and how different they are from the other people. Find which piece of the puzzle you are in this beautiful world and determine to comfortably settle in where you best fit, knowing and appreciating that if you decide to change you in anyway, you distort the whole setting of the world.

20070313122721AACj72T	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Porque los hombres aman a las cabronas?	Pues por fin he terminado de leer el libro, tambien ya habia leido el manual de la perfecta cabrona, y la guia para ser una perfecta cabrona y creo que esta serie de libros estan mal titulados, ya que la "cabrona" que describen no lo es tal.    Simplemente trata de la mujer que tiene un potencial que no utiliza, ya sea porque su formación se lo impide o porque siente que la sociedad no la deja, pero si la mujer ejerciera todo su poder y conocimiento y dejara de ser sumisa y dejada, las cosas serian diferentes, considero que es un insulto al genero femenino que las pongan como "cabronas" cuando solo hablan de hacer valer sus derechos. Este tipo de libros lo único que hacen es alentar una falsa liberación de la mujer, como si se tratara de ella como de un animalito enjaulado, Vende la idea absurda del "dominio" sobre los demás, específicamente sobre los varones, Opino que el dominio verdadero debe ser sobre una misma sobre tus carencias, sobre tus debilidades, sobre tu esclavitud mental

But in the winter, why are there some people who like living in a house with all the blinds and curtains closed?  They usually have their lamps on because its so dark inside.  Why don't they just open the window shades?     Are they dead to nature and not thinking about it?    What's going on with them?

20090205131148AADzwa3	Social Science;Psychology	What is wrong with me?	I have always been a strong person, would doesn't show a lot of emotion, and doesn't trust people very easily (especially men). I guess this all started when I slept with one of my best friends (of 6 years), one of the few people I really trust. Ever since then, I have been feeling worse and worse about myself. I never want to go anywhere except work and home. I don't have any desire to see my family or friends, and I feel bad about that, but I don't miss them, and I would just rather be alone. I don't have any desire to date or start a relationship, now or ever. No one appeals to me. Why do I feel this way? My family is really worried about me, but I just feel cold and indifferent to everyone. And think I might feel better if I could talk to someone and get all of my feelings out, but there just isn't anyone that I am comfortable talking to. This has been going on for 10 months now. I thought I would get over it, but it seems to be getting worse. What should I do?

20090205123455AA65z0N	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Would relationships work better if people would stop looking for their mates to be parental figures?	For instance: Women who look for a man to financially support them or men who look for women to clean, cook, and basically raise them.      I'm bringing this up because I had a roommate in college who was always saying things like, "Any guy I date has to have money, he has to buy me____ and ___".  I'm thinking, 'The only guy that is OBLIGATED to pay for you and financially support you is your father, not your boyfriend or husband'.  Why do people try to make parents out of their partners?
20090205111145AAIGxcI	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies are you happy that we live in a time now, when a 45 year old WOMAN is hotter than a 25 year old one ?	Considerably.  I mean just look around you.  Women have been much   kinder to themselves since the Industrial and Sexual Revolution took   place.  I call this the age of Narcissism.  The new millenium has   said look.  Older women are more valuable than gold.  And I mean   that in ways that I cannot explain.  They are just beautiful.  Growing   older gracefully,  never was more true.  It is just the flair, the energy,   the maturity, and grace itself.  That is harbored by these wonderful   human beings.  A strand of gray is even sexy on a woman,  a time or   two.  Anyway, you would have to be on a certain level to really grasp   the raw truth of what I am saying.  Older women nowadays are taking   better care of themselves and their bodies.  And even better,  they like   younger men,  and are not afraid to admit or show it.  He, he.  Do you   agree ? Older womanzzzzzzzzzz rule.

20090205102745AAOa6FB	Social Science;Psychology	I need to make a huge decision which involved a LOT of $$, but I can't make up my mind....what should I do?	Okay, so last September, Tina Turner announced her World Tour. She announced 2 dates for Dublin's O2 Arena on March 26th & 27th and me and my friends decided to go, all 4 of us. But we heard through the grape-vine that Turner was going to announce more dates, so we waited as we wanted, and still want to, go to the her last ever show, which will be in Europe, SOMEWHERE. Low and behold, Turner announce another Dublin date, April 11th & when that sold out in 15 seconds flat, she added April 12th as not just her final Irish date, but at the time, her last show in the history of ever - April 12th was going to beher last ever live performance and the last date of the World Tour. We managed to get 4 brilliant tickets on eBay for a bargain price (less than 400 euro's) for the 12th and we were chuffed.      In December, one of the group had to pull out as she was goign to Australia and since then, another has had to go as he will be in London, which is fine as 2 of us are still going and we'll be able to find 2 more poeple I'm sure. However, yesterday, Turner announced Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Paris and Antwerp dates AFTER the April 12th Date in Dublin and is expected to announce even more.       So because we want to go to Turners last ever show, I'm trying to decide whether to sell the 4 Dublin Tickets on eBay now and wait to buy 2, or 3 or 4 new Tickets on eBay for the last concert date. The thing is, if I do sell the Tickets, I'll become an instant thousandaire overnight and I don't feel comfortable having that much money as I will be able to charge anything from 300 upwards per ticket.       So what should I do? Sell the Ticjets now and hope Turner will announce a final date and not extend and hope tickets for that show will hopefully be up on eBay? Or just go to the Dublin Show, even though we have decided that we don't want to anymore as the Venue is tiny? And also, what of all that $$$? If I do sell the 4 Tickets and recieve an embarrasing amount of money, and I dont manage to get Tickets for a last date, what will I do?      I just cant make up my mind and I was wodnering if anyone had any advice.      Thanks,      Blue
