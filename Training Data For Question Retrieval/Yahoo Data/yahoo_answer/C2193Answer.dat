MFAVIW1waa	Yeah this can happen when you cheat or hack.

2UnAy7uvaa	Its a trick actually, <br>  <br>  When you are firing dont hold the mouse button for more than 3 - 4 seconds( unless you are at point blank range). All you have to do is fire for 3 - 4 secinds then wait till ur cross hair becomes normal than shoot again. <br>  <br>  Or you can keep on tapping your mouse button instead of holding it. This doesnt allows the cross hair to get big.<br>  <br>  Or you can sit and shoot, which is efficent, but not that good if the guy is really close.<br>  <br>  P.S i perfer the tapping one because you can continuously shoot with out stopping, but it does take practice.<br>  <br>  P.S.S i am a first lueitenant add my xfire if u need more help <br>            codename : tripolarshot|`|zLN2sOMfaa	if its keeps on getting bigger( never getting smaller while shooting) ur having fps lag. 2 fix it u have 2 lower the graphics. no big deal cuz the graphics arent that good.<br>  If its ur gun it is broken. u have 2 repair it.<br>  <br>  p.s. wen ur far away and  u dont have a snipr dont waste ur time killing the guy . the more u use ur gun the more it will get messed up<br>  and also burst fire if u r really desperate on killing the far away guy.<br>  burst firing is wen u shoot 1-2 bullets at a time

Read up on it, its amazing.|`|e9695c75152e6d757a83f3e1f8134384aa	you cant go wrong with Resistance or Call of Duty, but I wouldnt buy Uncharted, its a good game but it only took me about 3 hours to beat it. Left 4 Dead is a pretty cool game too|`|3MjGo3WMaa	At the point, id say that Resistance 2 is the best first person shooter on the PS3, followed closely by Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Resistance has an extremely good story line, great graphics, incredibly large maps, and also two different online multiplayer modes. The cooperative can be up to 8 players, and you play together on various missions, and features three different characters. The Soldier which is equiped with a heavy machine gun which causes alot of damage and also creates a force barrier whcih blocks incoming enemy damage, the Special Ops which carries a three round burst riffle that causes alot of damage and also shoots out an electrostatic orb which causes damage to all enemies near it, also the spec ops can pass out ammo to themselves and other , and the medic, which uses a special weapon that drains enemies of their health which will allow you always be filling up on health, and heal your team mates. Then there is the competitive mode where you compete against other players in deathmatch, team match and other strategy based game modes. The other game i would recommend right now is killzone 2 which unfortunately hasnt come out yet, but as soon as it does, you can bet im gonna be all over that one|`|DioXrjBIaa	I second Metal Gear Solid 4.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	Bullion items are fine for investment if one did not pay to much but they sit real low in the minds of coin collectors or numismatist. Yes there is a difference between them. I have 2 sets of Winged liberty Head dimes (Mercury). They are a beautiful coin even though they are small. The 1916-D dime kind of is very expensive and goes up every year. That date stops a lot of people from putting a set together. Ancient and medieval coins are history in ones hand, but require a good library and dedication. Most U.S. coin dealers know the hot coins of the moment but little else. There are exceptions but to few. A dealer that has knowledge on large cents or colonial coins, ancient coins or historic coins is the person to get to know. You can pick their brain for knowledge and if they are a good dealer will give you the info free. Here are some of the good guys www.piecesoftime.com, www.anythinganywhere.com. They sell ancient coins and historic world coins. For U.S. coins check out you local dealers and see which one treats you the best. I get better deals from my local dealers than the big mail order places for they know me and know I know a lot about Asian coins, they pick my brain I pick theirs. Have fun and welcome to the "Hobby of Kings".|`|nvaynqfZaa	I think collect those coins, which you prefer. But remember, as a coin older and better quality - the quicker price is up.
4o3jaVHuaa	I love Knott's!!<br>  <br>  As far as I know, Xcelerator. My favorite rollercoaster, and the first of its kind (paved the way for record-breakers like Top Thrill Dragster and Kingda Ka). No trip to Knott's is complete without it. The launch from the station is so powerful that you don't even notice the drop from the top of the hill.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for more thrill rides, I also recommend:<br>  Ghostrider (my favorite wooden rollercoaster; I always thought all woodies were the same, until I met Ghostrider)<br>  Montezooma's Revenge (another fast launch)<br>  Riptide<br>  Supreme Scream<br>  Perilous Plunge<br>  Silver Bullet (it's a shame that they drained out their iconic lake to put this in, though)<br>  Boomerang|`|GDKBqwwJaa	Xcelerator! You shoot out real fast, go straight up, then down and go over one hill. If you want a fun wooden one, Ghost Rider. Its pretty big and even fast, at least for a wooden coaster.|`|cCAGstnpaa	I don't think you should go tomorrow. The reason why is because the 3 best rides in the park which are: Xcelerator, Rip Tide, and Ghost Rider are going to be closed all month They are closed from the 17th of February until the 31st of March. I was supposed to go too, but now I don't want to because those awesome rides are closed. Hope you fave fun anyway! The only other huge awesome ride is Silver Bullet but you will have to wait in line for about 3 hours. Have fun!

It's stupid. Anyway, the only way to empty a control group is by killing it's members. So build a farm, assign it to CTRL + the-number-you-want-to-take-off and then cancel the farm. That will empty it. But it doesn't hurt to have those hotkeys.

Then try going through the process of reformatting it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If when you reconnect the hard drive the system doesn't restart, then either the hard drive is gone (broken) or the system isn't reading it properly and there may be something wrong with your system.

2GNFQPdmaa	regular mounts are 60, I'm pretty sure.|`|k3cmetWRaa	I was curious since I have a druid as well so I did some research.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Druid#Forms" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Druid#Forms</a><br>  <br>  Somebody made a nice chart on the Druid forms...<br>  <a href="http://www.forgoodnotevil.com/druid/speed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgoodnotevil.com/druid/spee...</a><br>  <br>  Here are the facts ...<br>  <br>  Travel Form<br>  Travel Form(lvl 40) = 40% Ground<br>  Flight Form (lvl 68) = 60% Ground<br>  Swift Flight Form (lvl 70) = 100% Ground, 280% Flight<br>  Feral Move Speed Increase = +15% in Travel form<br>  <br>  Mount Speeds<br>  Ground Mount = 60% Ground Only<br>  Flying Mount = 60% Ground and Flight<br>  Epic Mount = 100% Ground and Flight<br>  PVP Mounts = 100% Ground and Flight<br>  Swift Flying Mount = 100% ground, 280% Flying<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see from the list, at the lower levels Travel Form is no matter what slower than a mount.  With the "Feral Speed Increase" you can get as close as 55% which is only 5% slower than a basic ground mount.<br>  <br>  At 68 you gain Flight Form which is equivalent to a standard ground mount.<br>  <br>  At 70 you get Swift Flight form which is equivalent to an Epic Flying mount.<br>  <br>  Another important thing to note is the link to the chart.<br>  With some enchanted gear and talents you can go faster than even epic ground mounts on the ground. <br>  <br>  Regular Cat form can go to 150%, and during a dash go as high as 195% which is roughly twice as fast as an epic ground mount.  Note: This is Special PVP Gear ONLY.<br>  <br>  Also with this gear, Bear can get to 124%, while Travel can get to 160%.<br>  <br>  <br>  This make you think of another question...<br>  "If Travel Form is slower than an epic ground mount, why might I use it?"<br>  <br>  One reason is that you can harvest professions such as skinning and herbalism without changing form.  If on a mount you have to unmount to farm, then remount.  Also in Travel form you can attack and are given some level of protection in terms of armor.<br>  <br>  Thus in high populated areas you can switch travel form to move around quickly and then morph into the feral form you want when attacked.  But upon first attack your travel form will protect you from the initial strike.|`|qQf0V6iWaa	Travel form is 40%, yes.<br>  <br>  Check the source(s) for help.

2GNFQPdmaa	quick easy gold doesn't exist. Everyone I've ever known who bought gold got caught and banned.<br>  <br>  If you have enough seed money, you can become one of those auction house people, who camps the auction house, buys up all of something, and lists it again for more gold. My friend's little brother has hundreds of thousands of gold that way, but he's an obsessive who never does anything but camp the AH.<br>  <br>  Other than that I would say your only real option is to stop buying your profession mats if you're still leveling. Your professions can wait. Most people I know level with two farming professions because of the money thing. Crafting profs are expensive. Skinning's a great example because if you start with skinning you don't actually have to farm, you'll kill skinnable things all the way up.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're 80 already, then do dailies if you don't like farming and farming if you don't like dailies.|`|aOFdtoR4aa	World Of Warcraft Gold Secrets - the secret tactics of the players <br>  <br>  <a href="http://tovarbaza.com/offer.php?pid=LUKE13&id=26828835" rel="nofollow">http://tovarbaza.com/offer.php?pid=LUKE1...</a>|`|OjQovKaDaa	One of my good friends sent me this easy-to-use guide that got me a hundred gold TRADED to me in-game!

bfsym1dsaa	I'm going to make my movesets on the behave that you do not have FireRed, LeafGreen or Emerald, so I won't suggest ANY moves that will be only available from the move tutors of those games. I will also not suggest any Pokemon that is not available from Sapphire alone. Feel free to email me if you do have any of those games, since I can make a MUCH STRONGER team. I will also leave Sceptile/Blaziken out since they're 2 other starters that you may not have. I will also not suggest Wobbuffet, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Jirachi, and Deoxys in any part of this team, because they're Uber, besides Jirachi, whom you may not have. Wobbuffet is Uber and cheap :P. It's like guarentee-kill or free switch.<br>  <br>  All of my sets will be written in form of:<br>  (Hoenn Dex #) Name @ Item<br>  Ability: Nature<br>  EV Spreads<br>  - Moves<br>  - Moves<br>  - Moves<br>  - Moves<br>  <br>  Comments..<br>  ____________<br>  <br>  Swampert's actually best with Relaxed nature.<br>  (009) Swampert @ Leftovers<br>  Torrent: Relaxed<br>  252 HP/136 Def/120 SpA<br>  - Earthquake<br>  - Surf<br>  - Ice Beam<br>  - Curse or Rock Slide or Rock Tomb<br>  <br>  You should really use Relaxed nature to bring its ability to tank with is great HP/Def combo to its full advantage. Albeit a loss of speed, plenty of things outspeed it anyways, and the great HP/Def stats can carry you far enough. Naughty nature isn't really good because Swampert's only weakness, and it's a 4x weak to Grass, that means a loss of Special Defense can bring it to demise. <br>  <br>  (031) Gardevoir @ Leftovers<br>  Trace: Timid or Calm<br>  4 HP/252 SpA/252 Spe<br>  - Psychic<br>  - Thunderbolt<br>  - Wish<br>  - Protect / Will-o-Wisp<br>  Special sweeper + can heal by Wish & Protect. Simply said. Very strong if you train it well. Timid nature is for speed while reducing its useless Attack. This thing is the evolution of Kirlia.<br>  <br>  ** Again, if you want to use the best Swampert or Kirlia, you'd have to replace them with the right nature, or else, just stick to what you have. By the way, what's the point of asking for help if you put so much restriction to what are we allow to suggest you for changes and what not? Your "threat" that was like "I WILL REPORT" stuff scares answerers away, so next time don't put that. People here are trying to help you, not to try-to-help-and-end-up-getting-reported. If you want to note something, ask nicely, not with a shouting tone...<br>  <br>  Anyways...<br>  <br>  Your Torkoal is Hasty nature, which raises its horrible, useless speed in exchange for decreasing its highest and most useful Defense... Good job. Torkoal isn't really good defensively, since it's weak to Ground/Rock type attacks, which are both physical in Sapphire. Don't use. Vulpix was actually a much better choice, but anyways, for your fire type... Salamence with Fire Blast is really your best choice. A MixMence is very scary :D.<br>  <br>  (189) Salamence @ Leftovers or Lum Berry<br>  Intimidate: Rash<br>  132 Atk/180 SpA/196 Spe<br>  - Brick Break<br>  - Dragon Claw<br>  - Fire Blast<br>  - Earthquake or Hydro Pump or Aerial Ace (breed with male Gyarados that knows Hydro Pump) or Dragon Dance... Fly can be used if you're not using this competitively, plus can be useful to travel.<br>  <br>  Large movepool, puts threat from both sides. Watch out for opponent who use Ice. This thing, offensively, is huge devastation that will make your opponents go "OMG I just got r4ped :( !!!!"<br>  <br>  (194) Regice @ Leftovers<br>  Clear Body: Brave or Quiet<br>  204 HP/252 Atk/52 SpA (If Earthquake is chosen)<br>  204 HP/112 Atk/36 Def/96 SpA/60 SpD (if Curse is chosen, Quiet nature only)<br>  - Earthquake / Curse<br>  - Ice Beam<br>  - Thunderbolt<br>  - Superpower<br>  <br>  A single-handed Pokemon who can handle almost ANYTHING. The nature chosen lowers Speed because EVERYTHING ELSE IS NEEDED. Torkoal's Super Effective Flamethrower shouldn't even kill half of its damage if trained good... If actually used defensively, its Special Defense is at max 548. Even if we're not using it defensively, it should still be well into the mid-400's at level 100. Its Defense is also superb at being good 250~ or +. EV'd in HP, it is nearly untouchable unless hit multiple times by Super Effective attacks. Most special attackers cannot even scratch this giant iceberg, and you can always heal back HP by using Wish on Gardevoir and switch to him the turn after. Plus, he is not Water/Ice but purely Ice type, so not weak to Electric/Grass is really great. Superpower kills opponent Ice types as well as normal types, but beware of the Stat losses after a use, so it's adviced to switch it out when needed. Judge that for yourself. Earthquake is just for more type coverages, but Curse is really the preferable move, since not only it raises is Attack and Defense, but can also be used for the make up of the lost stats from Superpower. If Curse is chosen, alongside with its EV, it will have High HP, High Attack (after 1+ Curse), High Defense (after 1+ Curse), Good Special Attack (Medium/High), Sky high Special Defense, low speed. Of course, speed isn't needed if you can take so many hits lol... Heal up with Wish if you need. Its ability also prevents lowering of Attack from Salamence or Gyarados' Intimidate. Gyarados will fear this thing after 1 or 2 Curse(s) as it cannot or should not be able one Brick Break, but you can laugh at it and then eat it with Ice Beam. Regice is probably one of the strongest and most versatile Pokemon available. If you have the other 3rd Gen. games with move tutors, Thunder Wave is great for crippling the opponent and smash away, while Substitute + Focus Punch will give you immunities to status due to Sub, Focus Punch will hit extremely hard; harder than Superpower, and no Stat loss.<br>  <br>  (077) Medicham @ Leftovers<br>  Pure Power: Jolly<br>  4 HP/252 Atk/252 Spe<br>  - Brick Break/Hi Jump Kick<br>  - Shadow Ball<br>  - Rock Slide (if you or have tutor from FR/LG/E) or Hidden Power Rock<br>  - Bulk Up<br>  <br>  Nothing can stand this thing's attack besides maybe Weezing and Skarmory. Pure Power can increase a Jolly natured Medicham's max attack to an equivalent of 438 at max, or around 480 if Adamant nature is used (not suggested since he needs speed). There is not a single Pokemon in game that resists the combo of a Fighting and a Ghost move, that means at least one of the two will hit at least neutral on EVERY POKEMON in game. Hi Jump Kick is stronger, but do mind that if can miss and hurt yourself. This thing is a Glass Cannon so if it misses you will get hurt, but the higher power may be worth is so you choose it wisely. Brick Break can kill Reflect/Light Screens while not give any recoil, but you lose power, still, gains accuracy. Rock Slide is really preferred to hurt things such as Salamence, but if that's unavailable, HP Rock works too... However, finding a good Pokemon with the right Hidden Power and at high power is beyond a pain. Your choice. Bulk up is for beefing you up... :D<br>  <br>  At last but not least, the annoyer + physical tank, your Skarmory...<br>  Gentle nature is useless. Trade it for impish, since you lose the useless SpA stat instead.<br>  <br>  (115) Skarmory @ Leftovers or Chesto Berry<br>  Keen Eye: Impish<br>  252 HP/60 Atk/184 Def/12 Spe<br>  - Spikes<br>  - Whirlwind/Roar<br>  - Drill Peck/Aerial Ace<br>  - Rest<br>  <br>  Spikes for annoying things, and then Whirlwind or Roar away for Spikes damage. Lay down a layer when you got a chance; 3 Layers for maximum effect. Drill Peck is the true preferable form of attack, since it has highest power, but it's only available as an egg move with Fearow. Aerial Ace is a great alternative but much weaker. Rest can be used to heal up and Chesto can wake it up once. Whirlwind is a pain to get with Drill Peck, but can be achieved. The only preference for Whirlwind over Roar is Roar does not work on Pokemon with Soundproof ability but Whirlwind does. If you choose the easier path, with its slight difference, use TM05 for Roar. Steel Wing shall not be used because this thing is good for walling Fighting type Pokemon, who take Super Effective damage from Flying type attacks but not from Steel.<br>  <br>  If you got questions, feel free to email me or contact by Yahoo messenger.

crhJLuw5aa	It depends upon whether or not you're playing limit or no-limit. In limit, if C's all in bet totals 1/2 or more of the original bet, then the betting IS opened to further raising. Answer: A<br>  <br>  If you're playing no-limit; in MOST card rooms the all-in has to equal a full raise in order to reopen the betting. There ARE a few rooms that use the limit rule, however. So the answer for no-limit is: Usually B, but sometimes A.|`|LItIiiHKaa	Presuming player A has more than $20 then the answer is A.  He can fold, he can call, or he can re-raise, presuming it makes sense to meaning player B has more than $20 as well, although you can always push more chips in than people can call if you want anyway.<br>  <br>    I can't believe there are other answers here.  You are right dude :D|`|CBTAgeu4aa	Its a you can call fold or re raise.|`|szyrw5P0aa	C|`|B0s9BdRDaa	B|`|n4QbLNC6aa	a|`|eNHGiEvGaa	I would say A could call, fold or re-raise, which is answer a.  However, there may be issues depending on house rules.  <br>  <br>  More ambiguous is the situation where player C might go all-in for $40.  That's less than half the amount needed for a legitimate raise.  In a limit game, player A would only be allowed to "complete" the bet to $60.  I've seen some people play NL with a rule that prevents re-raising in such a case.<br>  <br>  It MAY be true in some house rules that an all-in that's insufficient for a legitimate raise cannot be reraised.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think a good house rule would be that half a legitimate raise (from 30 to 45 all-in) should allow a reraise of any amount, but less than that can only be called (or folded).  Under such a rule, your example would still have "a" as the correct answer.|`|440d4a17aefc552ef492e82a97f3ffefaa	answer b because it wasnt a full reraise

Brawl for the wii, and I dont know if it was my gamestop, but they required me to have a California ID, thumb print, and much more, it was a drag.

2SN8Hfzkaa	pokérus (a portmanteau of Pokémon and virus) is a rare virus introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver. It is extremely infectious in nature, being able to spread between Pokémon of different species. The only cure for Pokérus is to wait for a period of 24 hours. Infected Pokémon can be traded to Pokémon Red and Blue, but because Pokérus does not exist in these games, it cannot be contracted or spread when traded. However, the effects of the Pokérus are still applied. Similarly, a Pokémon with the Pokérus cannot be cured while in these two games. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Pokérus is displayed as a pink rectangle stating Pokérus in the Summary window.<br>  <br>  Despite being a virus, Pokérus is beneficial to its hosts. Pokérus accelerates the hidden statistical development of Pokémon (that is, its training) by making it gain effort values at twice the speed. This effect is cumulative with the Macho Brace, and an infected Pokémon with such an item effectively trains at four times its normal rate. In the third generation games, where training is capped to a maximum, the Pokérus does not raise this maximum limit. The overall effect on a Pokémon's strength is thus negligible, as a Pokémon can be fully trained with or without Pokérus. It is, however, easier to fully develop a Pokémon's skills with Pokérus because it reduces the number of battles needed to fully train the Pokémon.<br>  <br>  Pokérus is mainly contracted from battles; there is a 2 in 65,535 chance of contracting Pokérus in battle. If a Pokémon in the active party has Pokérus, in each round of battle there is a 1 in 2 chance (1 in 3 in the third generation) that an adjacent Pokémon on the team will contract the Pokérus. The active Pokémon can also contract Pokérus in this manner if the first "bench member" has the Pokérus.<br>  <br>  Pokérus is cured after 24 hours on the party from the time of infection; Pokémon cannot be cured of Pokérus if left in a PC box or are traded to Pokémon Stadium 2 or Pokémon Box. It also appears that pokerus will not stop being contagius even after twenty-four hours in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Once Pokérus' effects end, the host develops an immunity to it and pokerus can no longer be transmitted. However, the accelerated stat growth remains, the Pokémon only loses the ability to spread it.<br>  <br>  Pokérus was mentioned in the Pokemon Chronicles episode Oaknapped as a lifeform that Team Rocket was looking for to accelerate their evolution process.|`|VBretICmaa	thanks 4 the info professor evan j|`|5f98c68d45ace3786635a74fbe70b0bdaa	so basicaly its just a virus that helps the process of ev training faster

Switching your religion for trade routes, some buildings, great people turned into specialists, banks, some wonders, land spaces with money bag logos/gold coins, trades w/othr civ, NOT OUTGROWING YOUR OWN MEANS!!!!!! That is the biggie that I always forget! LOL! When you build new towns it costs money especially if it is not on wny terrain that produces gold. Remembers that some gov. requires you to spend 1 gold coin per turn per units you have! <br>  <br>  Good luck! remember to grab good resources to trade later ie. horses for 20+ gold per turn...depending on how bad the civ needs horses, especially early on when the knights are dominant!

yixKb0ocaa	The microphone is built in your Nintendo DS. You need a Nintendo DS to play this game. So basically to play you only need the game and the system.|`|2d9f347fae9d8bf5d852e187b4ff8269aa	no
d5ghPR6xaa	huh, that is strange. Might have something to do with your computer. I suggest restarting it. other than that, you might just have a slow computer and it has a mind of its own? That's what used to happen to mine, except the houses went red instead of the water.

45HOtetgaa	Did you get the characters to live with you then? Because you said you were able to change their clothes. Or did you just use the boolprop cheat and control them with that? Either way, you do have to be able to select those sims, as in, you have to be able to control them. Then, it sounds like you already changed their clothes to get rid of the costumes, but in order to get rid of the masks, you have to get them to go to a mirror, and then choose "change appearance". Then just choose a normal hairstyle. All the mask is, is a hat, so changing their appearance will allow you to see their faces.

Biggest disappointment of the year in my opinion! Sorry about my abrupt disagreement but I feel it is true.<br>  I cannot name my top 5 video games so I'll just say my favourite games from each category:<br>  <br>  BEST SHOOTERS: CALL OF DUTY 4 (PS3), HALO TRILOGY (XBOX), UNREAL SERIES (PC), TIMESPLITTERS TRILOGY (XBOX), FAR CRY (PC).<br>  <br>  BEST FREE ROAMERs/ADVENTURE:   GTA SERIES. GTA SAN ANDREAS IS THE BEST.  GTA IV COMES 2ND PLACE AND IS VERY GOOD INDEED BUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT LACKED.  MUCH BETTER STORY AND GRAPHICS THOUGH! THE SHOOTING/COVER SYSTEM IS IMMENSE AND IT ACTUALLY (AT TIMES) FEELS MORE LIKE A GOOD 3RD PERSON SHOOTER. NIKO IS MY FAVOURITE GTA CHARACTER AS WELL. CAN’T WAIT FOR THE PC VERSION!!    MY OTHER FAVOURITE IS:<br>  CANIS CANEM EDIT (PS2) - ALSO KNOWN AS 'BULLY'. ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENOL GAME; I PREFERRED IT TO SAN ANDREAS; IT BLEW ME AWAY HAVING CLOCKED 100'S OF HOURS WORTH OF PLAYTIME! ‘ROCKSTAR’  RULES THIS CATEGORY!!<br>  <br>  BEST RACERS: LEGO RACERS 1,2 (SERIOUSLY NO JOKE). 2 HAS A BETTER STORY - 1 HAS BETTER GAMEPLAY AND IS WAY MORE FUN TO PLAY AGAINST FRIENDS! ALSO MY OTHER FAVOURITE IS CRASH: TAG TEAM RACING. VERY ADDICTIVE INDEED; ESPECIALLY VERSUS- MODE AND MULTIPLAYER.<br>  <br>  BEST RPG: ELDER SCROLLS SERIES (PC), FABLE (XBOX)<br>  <br>  BEST PLATFORMERS: SPYRO, SUPER MARIO GALAXY (WII), CROC, CRASH TRILOGY, JAK II (PS2), SIMPSONS GAME (PS3), RATCHET AND CLANK 3, PRINCE OF PERSIA: SANDS OF TIME(PS2), TY THE TASMANIAN TIGER (Xbox).<br>  <br>  BEST STRATEGY: FINAL FANTASY GAMES (7, 8, 10 ARE THE BEST).<br>  <br>  BEST FOOTBALL GAME: FIFA (2000 AND 2008 ARE THE BEST!!). FIFA 09 is gonna whip PES 09's butt.  FIFA IS SO MUCH MORE OLD-SKOOL..<br>  <br>  BEST TENNIS GAME: VIRTUA TENNIS 3 (TOP SPIN 3 SUCKS BIG TIME).<br>  <br>  BEST SKATING GAME: TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER 4, TONY HAWK: UNDERGROUND, TONY HAWK AMERICAN WASTELAND.     'SKATE'  IS A JOKE! THE OLD TONY HAWKS ARE THE BEST (ONLY 'PROVING GROUND' WAS A LET DOWN).<br>  <br>  BEST 3RD PERSON SHOOTERS/ADVENTURE: UNCHARTED: DRAKES FORTUNE (PS3), GEARS OF WAR (XBOX 360).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS3 VS XBOX?: <br>  <br>  <br>  PS3 all the way..///

Mzrx4IDWaa	Yeah it snows at the beginning of spring pretty much every year I find. However I haven't ever noticed snow in autumn as far as I know. Pretty sure it's just winter and spring.|`|2yUQiKlvaa	ive had seasons for a while and i have never seen snow in spring, i dunno if the weather man says that either as i didnt really listen to the weather channel
F3N5QfIDaa	dont go play hardcore alot of people think hardcore is for skilled players just cause of the name its not all people do in hardcore mode is camp it takes skill in normal matchs cause u actually need accuracy<br>  <br>  heres some nice tips thou <br>  <br>  1. always be looking for your next covered position as u move <br>  2. dont sprint around corners it slows your time to aim an shoot <br>  3. dont use your iron sights if your enemy is within 10 feet strafe an shoot from the hip <br>  4.never travel in front of your teamates as u will be shot at 1st once u make contact<br>  5.if your shot from behind dont turn around to shoot unless your out in the open instead sprint around a corner or into a building an get a hard point an aim at the entrance chances are he will chase you but u will have the element of surprise as u know where he will be coming from <br>  6.when aiming with iron sights instead of re positioning with your weapon just strafe if possible<br>  7.when using a fully automatic weapon shoot in short bursts to reduce recoil<br>  8.using juggernaut makes ppl angry who cares if it helps u survive more power to u all is fair in love an war <br>  9.one of the best weapons in the game is the mp40 has great stoppin power <br>  10.learn the maps half the battle is knowing the map once u learn a map|`|VwZvy5H7aa	the best way to get better at cod5 is to play hard core matches because they mostly show you were good places are to be so when you are playing regular team deathmatch or so you will already know where they will go and how to get away from were they are located so you wont die|`|CA3WTflAaa	shoot without mercy and shoot the **** out of every thing or snipe people|`|KckdJfJ5aa	Like the others have said, play hardcore, play on all the hardest difficulties and above all: practice, practice, practice!<br>  P.S. if you play hardcore online here are a few tips to make sure you don't die every 3 seconds or get booted from the game:<br>  1. when making a custom class don't pick martyrdom people will hate you and instantly label you as a noob instead pick Last stand or if you have particularly slow reflexes pick Juggernaut which will give you an extra few seconds to turn around and open fire<br>  2. when playing in levels with open spaces do NOT go out into the open, to a skilled sniper you're a sitting duck<br>  3. Emphasizing on not going out into open spaces, as tempting as it may be to get into the turret on top of the tank do not get into the turret it also makes you an easy target for snipers<br>  4. unless you have the firepower to take on a tank like satchel charges or a rocket launcher don't try to be the "team hero" and take on the tank by yourself with an assault rifle you'll just get killed<br>  5.speaking of rocket launchers and satchel charges, when playing on hardcore don't use these to get an easy kill you'll also get everyone really mad at you<br>  6.If your going to be a sniper make sure you do one of these three things or any combination of them: pick as your perk camoflage because when the enemy team calls in a recon plane or an artillery strike your an easy target, have some protection for your six, either put down bouncing betty's or have a teammate with a better close quarters weapon protect you<br>  7. if you have a microphone, use it! for example if you have bomb squad and see an enemy bouncing betty then tell your teammates about it don't let them blindly walk into it and let the other team get an easy kill that could have been so easily avoided<br>  8.Finally my last tip for you, when playing capture the flag you only need one or two guys guarding the flag not half the team so if you see some of your teammates have the flag covered then go and get the flag, if one of your teammates already has the flag then go find him and guard him on the way back|`|UhtUt2cIaa	Yes! Play Hardcore mode and use the Camoflage perk! No one will expect it when they're staring at their UAV and you pop out of nowhere! I have a K/D of 1.9 and over 14,000 kills! Good Luck!
2Q2ltt1Saa	EA moved the release date to June 2nd, as of a week or two ago.|`|yacLHWqEaa	june 2nd|`|hMj3EZfiaa	it was Feb but now its june 2

8vyCtRuQaa	You get recon armor. However, you need to buy the ODST game, (formally known as Halo 3:Recon) and get the achievements from that game as well.
BttUGexOaa	Bioshock... dead space is boring as hell.|`|dSxQsvNYaa	trick question, is this????<br>  bioshock: insane fps action!!!!cost: $24 used!<br>  deadspace: pee your pants scary survival horror! cost: i dont know, but more then $30, at least.<br>  <br>  <br>  seprate genres!|`|nsLrmbQkaa	Bio shock is very repetitive  but the story is great and many twists and turns. I like it because its cool. <br>  But Dead space is more about Sci-Fi horror its ok but I like BoiShock|`|3KBlWS7kaa	bio shock, have both the games but bio shock had a much better story line and it had more upgrades for all of the weapons|`|t4u4XERBaa	dead space!|`|SvRXhbUWaa	I like bioshock more, who reall wants a game about an engineer anyway... Although the deaths are pretty cool|`|MGpW7p0Naa	bioshock it is a way better game|`|j0vE91afaa	tuff choice man.. I would go for Bioshock cause its probably cheaper cause its an old game. Both are good, buy both...
lQGDV7MEaa	With Xbox Live, you get to send voice messages, eliminating the annoying on-screen keyboard for those of us without keyboards. It has better voice chat, and the party system is a nice addition.<br>  Better downloads and easier navigation is also plus. Managing friends, messages, etc. is much easier than on PlayStation network.|`|tRDfcNxraa	some people have said xbox live is higher quality and more features, i really dont mind paying, it's less than 10 dollars a month|`|duIk8BFwaa	Gosh hear about Halo 3 gets me angry so annoying I think PSN (play station network) is better its free but XBOX LIVE does have all the things those people said but in other news are 360 owners getting Killzone 2 or MAG I love rubbing it in my friends face  :)|`|aq60VOU6aa	Larger community.|`|4JhcHJikaa	its not? you have to pay for live and not for ps|`|Zz75qmiBaa	Netflix and of course halo 3|`|RLvuSCfvaa	You can have live chat (as in private with people you choose, not in-game chat). The profile system (gamer tags) of XBL is more streamlined and easier to access than the whole trophies thing of PS3. The servers of XBL have more dedicated servers than PS3, which is to be expected, as you are paying for it, and most of the time, demos come out earlier for XBL. And if you think about it, $50 a year isn't really that unreasonable. Hope this helped.|`|ws2zuHfaaa	If you are a hardcore gamer, Xbox live is the way to go because it has better in-game features, better chat, and larger community.<br>  <br>  If you like extra features (like me), PSN is better because it has internet browser, Playstation Home, Folding @ Home, etc.  Plus PSN is free!<br>  <br>  So it really depends on what you want|`|RBJGpYfIaa	Just like the song says the PS3 song WHO NEEDS BLUE RAY ON A CONSOLE!|`|6gzBbwNvaa	Xbox live is a lot better.  You can use Netflix.  The marketplace is great.  More people have Xbox.|`|lqcd3K6saa	nothing ps netwrok is better free has internet and you can make as many accounts as you want for free!|`|71fAXTODaa	It's not. End of Story.|`|JvQ2Reb9aa	yeah X-BOX is like soooo cooool
cx9WeQJBaa	Hum one not listed there, Rune Factory 1 or 2, its by Natsume same ppl that make Harvest moon probably y they call it Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon.  Also from that Lost In Blue 1,2,3 is good survival on an island, Also Sims Animals not much know about it just got it today. And that's all the games i own that are like that alas you might find more if you hunt around but these i listed are excellent and are not sort games either are somewhat very long. The rest of the games you already listed like that so no others i know of.|`|GVr6vsSmaa	Nintendogs, any of those games really. Or dogz, catz or dolphinz games like that
rj8arBLgaa	i dont think you owe any money<br>  <br>  as for deleting your account, try looking at the email they sent you when you first signed up|`|mOWHDlKtaa	yes its free, but there might be optional features that you might have to pay, but if ur not gonna play it, then u wont get charged anything :)
Lz4wXr6paa	I never save up for paint brushes, but I sure want one! I can only manage to save up to like 10k without those scratch cards. Those get me to like 50k. I only go on neo for the guilds. But I definitely say get a baby paint brush!! Or Christmas, but you already did that!
BwsTfgWaaa	I'd say street fighter 4, and yes its on both systems. This is because nba 2k9 is fun if your with friends, same as street fighter. But when your by yourself, 2k9 is boring while playing witha  computer because its so dumb. Street fighter is an awsome game to play both with and without friends, on and off line|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Nba 2k9, it's a continuous game.<br>  When you beat Street Fighter 5 story mode the game gets boring.<br>  In Nba 2k9 you can just keep playing on and on. Plus the graphics are great.|`|J39Fr88waa	i think street fighter is for ps3 only buddy|`|1BHM6z8faa	Street Fighter is really really really really really really really really really really really

WYCaSnslaa	It's in the Armory where you can change your appearance.  There's an option to change your headgear.  Depending on what other items you have selected to wear, you can pick the bandanna.  <br>  <br>  If they're blocked out so you can't select one, try removing other headgear (glasses, helmet, radio, etc.) and try again.
43zXRpLYaa	You must pay $69 that day and the rest can be payments. When you pay the $69 they give you a ticket to get into the park. You can then go to the bank/annual pass center where they will take your ticket and give you the new pass. It is good that day. You also get 10-20% off food and purchases depending on which pass you get. You can add free parking for $59 unless you have the Premium pass for $389 where parking is free.<br>  <br>  If you go on your birthday, they will give you a free ticket which you can use for your annual pass. On my birthday, I got my free ticket, paid and extra $25 to go to both parks, then bought my pass and they deducted $94 from the price of my pass.|`|GWkfix89aa	Yes you can go the same day. Make sure that you enjoy all the benefits of the deluxe pass. Save your receipt for the parking they will pay you back for it when you go to the bank and get your picture and your pass.

EsyU6nrJaa	you be the judge of whether this makes it better or worse<br>  <br>  Aesthetic changes<br>  Lucas, Dawn, and Pearl have different outfits designed for colder weather, as the entire Sinnoh region has dropped in temperature. <br>  The template for the level, HP, and name of Pokémon in battle is a dark gray instead of white and its shape has changed. <br>  The Pokétch has been redesigned. Players can now move up and down between apps instead of having to go through all of them to return to a previous one. <br>  Some of the moves have been redesigned and have a different animation, such as Razor Leaf. <br>  When Pokémon are sent out from their Poké Balls, their back sprites now animate much like their front sprites have since Emerald Version. Front sprites for Generation IV Pokémon and other Pokémon in the Sinnoh Dex have also changed. <br>  When battling certain Trainers such as Gym Leaders and Pearl, their sprites are now animated to move in the same manner as Pokémon. <br>  Some trainers now use seals when sending out some of their Pokémon. <br>  The Eterna, Hearthome, and Veilstone Gyms have all had complete redesigns in the interior. <br>  Gym Leader closeups, just before a Gym battle, have been changed from enlarged sprites to higher-quality drawings and the terms VS. The Elite Four now also has this but it includes the player on the left side of the VS. and the Elite Four member on the right of the VS. <br>  The rooms where the player battle the Elite Four have been redesigned. Aaron now has logs and foliage in his room. Bertha now has rocks in her room. Flint now contains lava pits in his room. Lucian's room has only had minor changes to now include four large lights or glowing orbs on the floor. Cynthia's room has changed its color scheme and the lift leading up to the Hall of Fame is now partially contained. The Pokémon Center at the Elite Four has also been redesigned. <br>  When entering new areas, the location 'labels' on the top-left corner have been redesigned, much like they were between Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald. <br>  All gyms now only have Pokémon of their type specialty. <br>  Storyline changes<br>  The player meets Professor Rowan and the opposite gender character earlier, and obtains his or her starter Pokémon on Route 201. <br>  The first battle is against the player's rival, who, as always, has chosen the starter Pokémon that weakens that of the player. <br>  The player and the rival now encounter Cyrus at Lake Verity at the start of the game. The player can also meet Cyrus at different venues such as the Eterna City statue. <br>  Both Dialga and Palkia appear on Spear Pillar. Giratina, the mascot of Platinum, then phases into the world in front of Cyrus. <br>  A new area known as the Distortion World (Japanese: やぶれたせかい Torn World) is playable. It has floor-like sections floating at ninety-degree angles from each other, creating an effect similar to the art of M. C. Escher. It doesn't follow the Laws of Physics, making things like surfing down a waterfall going up possible. The camera angle switches between perspective and isometric views to suit the angle of the player. It also has moving platforms with jumpable gaps between them. Giratina, when here, will be in its Origin Forme and is also the only wild Pokémon located here. <br>  At least two new characters were added. One is Pluto, a professor of Team Galactic, and the other is a police officer spying on Team Galactic, using the codename "Looker". <br>  A tag battle between the player and his or her rival against Flint and Volkner takes place at the entrance to the Battle Frontier when the player first arrives there. <br>  Team Galactic's plans for world domination and the layouts of their HQs, such as the one in Eterna, have been changed. In addition, they openly recognize their goal and are more openly villainous. <br>  Some of the Gym Leaders have been reordered: Fantina is now the third Gym Leader, Maylene is the fourth and Crasher Wake is the fifth. <br>  Dawn/Lucas no longer gives the player the Dowsing Machine or the Vs Seeker near the Route 206 junction; instead he/she meets the player at the entrance to Mt. Coronet. <br>  Team Galactic appear in Stark Mountain under the command of Pluto, who seeks to use the destructive power of the volcano to extort money from the people of Sinnoh. The player, with help from Buck, must defeat them. During this event, Mars and Jupiter quit Team Galactic because Pluto does not share the same ideals as ex-boss Cyrus. Ultimately, Pluto and his two accompanying grunts are apprehended by Looker and two policemen. <br>  After the aforementioned event, the player is able to challenge all the Gym Leaders of Sinnoh to rematches in the Match Place. The player's tag battle partners from throughout the game (Cheryl, Buck, Marley, Mira, and Riley) are also able to be challenged in this café. Each of the 13 characters has a team of five Pokémon, whose levels are between 61 and 66. <br>  The Elite Four increase their Pokémon's levels after the player has completed the Stark Mountain event. Their|`|wPko6oDkaa	Probably it has a different theme, a different role (besides filling poke dex), and a different outfit. In Pearl, you get data on Palkia. In Diamond, you get data on Dialga.

hvcERsklaa	There are two different kinds of PS2s. There are the original models which did NOT have any network ability. There was literally nowhere to plug a network cable into them. If you have an old, large PS2, you MUST buy a Network Connector. This is a black piece of hardware that screws onto the back of your PS2, and has a network cable port in it. Without this hardware, your PS2 is physically impossible to connect a cable to. There is nowhere to "plug it in".<br>  If you have a new style PS2, it already has a port in it, and you are ready for the next step.<br>  <br>  Therefore, we are plugging into a wireless receiver. This is the component in a wireless network that sits far away from the router, off in a living room or bedroom or bathroom or whereever you want to be playing your games. The wireless receiver sits out with the PS2, merrily sending the PS2's game signals back to "home base".<br>  <br>  <br>  The thing on the left is the router. The thing on the right is the cable modem. <br>  <br>  So the signal comes into the house into the cable modem. You can see the heavy black cable on the far right. Now, a blue cable then sends the signal directly out of the cable modem and into the router. You can see that blue cable leaving the cable modem and then going into the router. The router now has "internet connectivity".<br>  <br>  The router can handle both wired and wireless connections. It then makes the internet available to anybody in the house. <br>  <br>  So in my setup, my PC is sitting right next to the wireless router and is directly plugged into it by a cable. You can see the grey cable going into the middle of my router. That is my main PC connected directly into that router.<br>  <br>  However, my PlayStation 2 is far away from my wireless router. So instead of running a super long cable all the way across the house to connect the PS2 into the back of the router, I instead have a wireless receiver over by the PS2. The PS2 has a cable connecting it to the wireless receiver. The wireless receiver uses its antennae to send that signal to this wireless router. You see how the wireless router has an antennae? It listens for those signals and then passes them along to the cable modem.<br>  <br>  So the router is a big "splitter". It takes one signal in from the cable modem, and it knows how to send information to my PC via the cable, and it knows how to send information ot the PS2 over the antennae. Wireless routers can easily handle multiple PCs, multiple laptops and multiple game systems all with one router. In fact in our home we have 2 different laptops and another PC all wirelessly communicating with that router at the same time that we play PS2 games wirelessly. Routers are pretty amazing little devices :)<br>  <br>  Your setup is now complete! Now you put in the network CD that came with your PS2, follow its instructions, and play online|`|cGIBVWhaaa	do you have it for xbox360?  if you do you need a network adapter(2 of them) 2 of them because one you need to hook up to your computer the other the xbox.|`|rj8arBLgaa	IDK GAMECUBE'S BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  (sorry but it had to be said)

r2bbLMUZaa	It's Garry's Mod, and it's a sandbox mod.<br>  <br>  A sandbox mod is basically an in game version of a game builder, where you can create events and spawn items, melding them in any means you like for a desired effect.<br>  <br>  As an example of this, you could spawn a bathtub, attach wheels to it, and with a little programming, turn it into a race car that follows a set route or a random one.<br>  <br>  Garry's Mod is a sandbox mod made from the game Half Life 2, and as such, works using the same props and physics engine, though people are creating custom props all the time.<br>  <br>  Garry's Mod used to be free, but became a purchasable game in it's 10th reincarnation in order to reimburse the programmer, Garry, for spending all his time updating it.|`|pCfApkLCaa	It's a mod that's really boring.

pbMnfypEaa	trade in values vary alot between games and stores depending on stock levels etc. phone around and see who offeres most. then get printout from all stores that offer highest ammounts for each game.. then take those printouts to game or blockbuster who will price match the offers if you ask nicely :)<br>  <br>  on a rough guide. good selling new games like XBOX 360 Fallout 3<br>  ,XBOX 360 Prince of Persia,XBOX 360 Fable 2 should trade in at around ￡20-25 a go

QzD3rJtMaa	It's definitely going to be Lightsworn or Twilight.  Now that DAD is Limited and Chaos Sorcerer is unbanned, Twilight seems like the perfect deck to make now.  Zombies are not gonna do much.  They took a huge hit as well just like Tele-DAD did.  Mezuki and Plaguespreader are both Limited now.  Zombies cannot be that effective anymore with only one Mezuki to work with.  With Plaguespreader at 1, they will have less Synchros and less of a Swarm factor now.  I think Plants and Spellcasters get a huge boost now.  Especially Spellcasters once the next 2 sets get released.  Some of the decks that have fallen off in the past year I think are going to make a big comeback.  I'm talking about Baboon decks and Monarchs.  Both decks have fallen off because of Tele-DAD and certain cards getting previously Banned or Limited.  Beast decks are an extremely viable option now with Baboon at 2, Manticore at 3, and with the release of Rallis the Star Bird, this deck is gonna be sick.  Card of Safe Return being Limited is the only thing that hurt the Baboon deck.  As for Monarchs, Raiza is back at 2 and the Banned list didn't really hurt them at all.  Glads can still be a problem, but I just don't see them doing anything now that Bestiari has been put at 1.|`|qo8hHZRzaa	zombie synchro or lightsworn is your best bet. maybe someone will get innovative again and come up with a whole new deck|`|1VtYZq5Caa	It will be Lightsworn, Spellcasters, Plants and Monarchs as the top decks for this format.<br>  I was LMAO when I saw Tele-DAD and Zombies being pwned on the banlist.<br>  Twilight is affected a fair amount because their draw power and d-hero has been semi-cutted. Chaos Sorcerer would be likely to get milled anyway.<br>  Glads will be cutting down in popularity becaus of Bestari and ROTA at 1 each.<br>  Very interestin format cuz i will use Lightsworn again and hopefully top more tournaments as I have.|`|d6QY6Rljaa	Lightsworns or Chaos easily. If the OCG banlist is what your going by, Zombies dont stand a CHANCE. With Mezuki, Plaguespreader and such limited, theres no WAY Zombies will be the same now. And, hate me if you will, but DaD didnt need to be limited to 1, 2 was just fine. And if it comes out soon enough, both the Beast Tuner and Ice Barrier Synchro monster, will rule the meta.
XOPvmV5Iaa	I just weighed a 2" dia by 3" candle and it was about 5 oz. So a pound would make about 3 candles depending on how long it was.
RVpl9ZeIaa	I used a netgear earlier today it isn't very reliable. Just keep trying and make sure you saved your connection settings.
XrGFZ2LJaa	Hmm..Let me evaluate your PC.<br>  <br>  * 3 GB of physical memory (RAM) is decent for playing latest games currently on the market, but also any future releases.<br>  <br>  *The Intel core duo processor is also sufficient for these purposes, and won't dissapoint in delivery. However, running at 2.20 GHz, it is a bit slow.<br>  <br>  * Yes, you're right. The 8600M GT is a poor - average video card. It should definitely play Empire: Total War on low settings, but I doubt it could comfortably run on medium or above. <br>  <br>  * Empire: Total War is compatible with the "Windows xp" operating system, so there are no problems there. <br>  <br>  * Please listen to me when I say, notebooks and Macs are not suited for gaming and never will be. The componenets in laptops need to be extremely small in nature and therefore they cost much more. Additionally, it's a very complicated and expensive process to replace broken parts. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Overall, you will be able to enjoy the experience, but you must remember to be conservative. Graphically you'll have some issues if you want to delve in the mid - higher end area.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	probably.

VYS1VfFXaa	Time to make a new character, they already took all your stuff, turned you into a girl, and dumped you in the woods.|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	Sorry i'm not too sure on how to do that, but try looking around on the forums.There are usually some threads that mods make to help people with these types of things.You could ask a friend to post on the forums and ask(they can't say your username or password or anything personal), but they can be general and just ask how to do it.<br>  <br>  Next time make sure you have a hard, but memorable password and have an up to date anti virus and make sure you don't give your password out.<br>  <br>  also try again because if it says it can't log you in that could mean that part of the site is down.Make sure you are putting your username in correctly too.|`|xMCQ4D4Oaa	Me and my brother play runescape, what we click on is something that says "Hack." you type in your usename or email I forget which one.

lQGDV7MEaa	Yes, the vitamins will count towards the 510 EV total.<br>  The vitamins add 10 EV's per stat the vitamin is associated with, and ten vitamins of one kind can be used. Since there are six, there can be several combinations for this.

EwJOA6rYaa	Hi, Christina!<br>  <br>  Procrastinator is right--it's just a cute little extra "event" to add random spice to the game.  Your character just hit herself with the refrigerator door.  It's happened to me several times, and it means nothing.<br>  <br>  Don't you just love Harvest Moon?!  ?|`|EVjoCpjEaa	Yes, this has happened to me several times actually.<br>  <br>  Apparently this 'ouch' thing has something to do with when they translated it from the Japanese version, in order to cover up an error.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions say it's probably just a 'realistic' event to add to the game.<br>  <br>  It usually happens when you're running against furniture in the house (phone, toolbox, fridge, shelf..)<br>  <br>  There's nothing to worry about though.
CixpYkUPaa	It means you need  hold for a couple seconds before executing your comand.

For example make stealthy sniper class as well as really tough close quarters guy. Basically, don't have all ten customized classes with a shotgun, Juggernaut, and martyrdom|`|f860d9de5373a1ac0136571344a5bae5aa	Ok, here are some classes I like to use on every kind of game type<br>  <br>  Team Death match:<br>  <br>  Type 100 w/ Box Magazine<br>  Any Pistol, Tokarev for your level<br>  Frag Grenade<br>  Signal Flare<br>  Bomb Squad<br>  Stopping Power<br>  Steady Aim<br>  <br>  Pretty good if you ask me, I prefer using Bandolier since I'm level 58 right now. <br>  <br>  War: (If you want to get a big multi kill)<br>  MP40 w/ Dual Magazine<br>  Any side arm<br>  Frag Grenade/ Sticky Grenade<br>  M9A1 Bazooka<br>  Fireworks<br>  Extreme Conditioning<br>  <br>  Honestly, this class has got me so much multi kills, not even kidding. 4 in 1 Grenades, 4 in 1 rockets, whatever you want. Always look at the flag your trying it capture and look at the numbers. When you get more than 2, there's your chance. <br>  <br>  Search and Destroy:<br>  MP40 w/ Suppresor<br>  Any pistol<br>  Any primary<br>  Smoke Grenade<br>  Bomb Squad<br>  Camouflage<br>  Steady Aim<br>  <br>  Really good class, you can go up from behind and just kill them all. They won't know where you are no matter what, except if you shoot your pistol pretty much.

lQGDV7MEaa	The locked house in the northeast part of the city, right?<br>  You can only enter that house with an event item, given out by Nintendo. Unfortunately, the event has not happened yet, and all you do is go to Newmoon Island, where you can catch Darkrai at level 40.|`|w4qS66aqaa	OH THAT! thats the members pass a.k.a. the item given to unlock darkrai, you need a nintendo event :[|`|8AYZpGgsaa	there's a key to the house?

It has the graphics of the PSP, the touch/motion of the DS/Wii, and games are MUCH cheaper.<br>  <br>  Nintendo DS is a close second, but dont get a PSP.|`|4FvK8XaJaa	Give DSi a chance. Here's a preview of it:|`|lOGhNHc7aa	PSP can play movies, music, games, get online and biggest screen size.<br>  IPod touch can play movies, music, games?, get online and touch screen.<br>  DSi can play movies?, music, games, get online and touch screen.<br>  <br>  The unique feature for them:<br>  PSP = biggest screen size, Memory Pro Duo storage (biggest 32GB at this moment).<br>  IPod = touch screen<br>  DSi = touch screen, camera?, mobile phone?, need an adaptor for storage (SD Micro 4GB at this moment).<br>  <br>  They're all wireless connection.<br>  <br>  I'll go for a PSP if the DSi doesn't have a camera and/or mobile phone function.|`|HJGJW1CZaa	The Ipod touch for sure, if you want to play games on it, if not get an Ipod classic, the newest one has a much better battery.<br>  <br>  You want one for free, check out my blog for all the info|`|pTg18froaa	i say the ipod touch because you can download songs unto it with no wires|`|duGCc6hfaa	I think that the psp gives you the more bang for your buck. But, if you have a lot of money to throw around get the I Touch. I doubt that the Nintendo DSi will be very great, because in my opinion the first one sucked. That's just my opinion, your welcome.

cLW7vFUGaa	You have to get 8 hearts with your future spouse before even being told about the Blue Feather. Once you do, the Mayor should come to your house and hint about it. Then you'll have to wait a random amount of time for another cutscene that will trigger first thing in the morning in front of your house, in which you will see the bluebird itself fly across town and drop its feather somewhere where you can retrieve it.<br>  <br>  Also, your proposal won't be accepted unless you have all the other marriage requirements: all heart events completed (2-heart gift, 4-heart date, 5-heart gift, 5 heart request FULFILLED, and 6-heart confession), a Level 2 house, and a double bed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VSUQ7NJhaa	no no no.... go to fogu.com and browse around it has info about all hte HM games.<br>  <a href="http://www.fogu.com/hm/animal_march/marriage.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fogu.com/hm/animal_march/marr...</a><br>  <br>  Getting the Blue Feather<br>   <br>  The next day after you see your first love confession, Hamilton will send you a letter. He explains the requirements for marriage and mentions a story about a blue bird.<br>  <br>  When a marriage candidate reaches 9 hearts, you'll awake in the morning to find Mira on your farm. She was walking by and noticed the Blue Bird was around. She suggests you chase after it because you can use the feather to propose. The bird can be found on the snowy summit of Garmoni Mountain between 5pm and 7pm. You can also visit Hamilton when he's home and he'll tell you a similar story about the bird.<br>  <br>  To get your own feather, go through the 45 floors of the Garmoni Upper Mine. You need to wait on floor 45 until 5:00 pm, when you can go through the mine exit to the summit of the mountain. You'll see the Blue Bird out on the cliff but it flies away as you get closer. Luckily a feather drops out of the sky as it escapes into the clouds.|`|3P1zn2Z0aa	Is it a game is so what kind
GKJV2EBSaa	To do this with one computer,open two windows.On one of the windows, log in. Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can. So it will save both hairstyles.It is very tricky to do so you will have to try it a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps you :)|`|KKuzo9Gaaa	This is from the Owner of Meez:<br>  <br>  During an update last night, Meez fixed a glitch related to having multiple items of the same type on an avatar. As part of this, some avatars with glitched hair may no longer have glitched hair. Unfortunately, we cannot restore avatars to their previously glitched state, or exempt people from the un-glitching efforts. If you valued having glitched hair, then we're sorry about removing it. That said, please be aware that glitched hair was never meant to be possible at all. There are still plenty of ways to have fun with your avatar - and we're adding new items all the time."<br>  <br>  I don't believe you will get banned, but I do know that you will not be able to do this. Well at least this is what another user said. l just copied and pasted what they said! XD.|`|C7ym17Djaa	Like the 1st person said. But I wouldn't do it since you could get a small ban.

hxSUCDzuaa	It shouldn't interfere with the original game. <br>  It really looks good, so I'm going to buy it as soon as possible. It is definitely worth buying. <br>  If you have an XBOX 360, go to xbox.com, sign in, and look for GTA Lost and Damned. It will give you all the information you need for the game, including the added vehicles and weapons (yay grenade launcher!!!).<br>  To the guy above: It's not in stores; it is a download for XBOX LIVE players only. PS3 owners cannot play it.|`|r60WMB6paa	wait is it in stores...???? cause i havent played it yet????|`|Med7VQI7aa	Well, I haven't personally played it, but I do know that your whole GTA IV Niko life changes to a different character with a different story (but don't worry you could switch back and forth).<br>  <br>  Also there are new weapons and the motorcycles handle much better.|`|lOGhNHc7aa	In my opinion.  No.<br>  <br>  It's very much like the old versions.  The difficulty has decreased.  e.g.  If you crash a car in front of a police, it won't give you a criminal star.  Your car is harder to be damaged...etc...<br>  <br>  It won't interfere with the original games.
gCtJkjpFaa	Maybe try updating to the latest version (5.00 M33-6).<br>  <br>  If not, then you might have to copy and paste everything from your memory stick your computer, re-format your memory chip and make it a magic memory stick again, then put everything back onto the memory stick again. Place the game into your ISO folder and it should work.<br>  <br>  This guide is the best on making a magic memory stick and explains it well (scroll down):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pspmod.com/forums/psp-hardware-guides/28839-easy-use-pandoras-battery-guide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pspmod.com/forums/psp-hardwar...</a>|`|hxSUCDzuaa	I don't know; I have 5.00 m33 firmware and I haven't had any problems with it. <br>  Try downloading the custom firmware again, re-install it, and see if you can play your ISOs again. If not, just get a higher custom firmware.<br>  P.S.  It may just be a problem in your "Recovery menu". It might have changed when you installed the new firmware.

I've heard that argument, and you're not really hurting anybody, but I'm sure the opinion of the game maker is that roms are illegal regardless.|`|Tr2WTkRjaa	u stole the game u don't own it return it to who ever...|`|Del5F0anaa	Noooooo<br>  but then since when have people been bothered about the law when it comes to games? ^____^
Irdp1kIEaa	I, the person who asked the question has found out the real answer (this is my real account). To defeat Bowser in Super Mario 63, You have to get to his tail, click and press down. When Mario grabs him, press left and right as fast as possible. To let go, press space and try to make him hit the bombs at the sides of the stage. If he falls off the stage, he will just jump right back up unharmed. Throw him into the bombs 3 times and Bowser will be defeated.Then a key will appear which can be used for the locked door in the Castle and the locked door in the water outside the castle. You really need to learn Casey C!|`|EsyU6nrJaa	just grab his tail and throw him off.. and don't you mean super mario 64?

However, that one license is only good for one computer's worth of online play.

The normal kids enjoy it healthily and for them it can be a release, making them less likely to act out at other times. <br>  <br>  Any correlation between video games and increased aggression is temporary: you can correct it through parenting.|`|624DxKxtaa	Oh god no.

DBBP6HJWaa	I LOVE NO-SCOPING!!! Ive loved it since the first time it killed me, and the second......and third......and many many more times.<br>  <br>  You should use an acog scope when no scoping. It wont make your gun any more accurate than with a normal scope but the time it takes you to scope, the time from pressing the down-scope button to the you being scoped in-game, is much faster with an acog scope. Also the acog scope is easier for a beginner, when you get better you can use a normal scope.<br>  <br>  Also the acog scope is good to have because you most likely are going to be shooting people from fairly close to mid range and with a normal scope you are a bit to magnified.<br>  <br>  There are two guns that you want to use when you try no scoping. The 50-cal and the M40. They both have good and bad points to them, but they are the two that I have used the most. <br>  <br>  The 50-cal is good because it is a semi-auto gun. That means that you can QUICKLY shoot at your target without having to load the next bullet into the gun. This is the main draw of the 50-cal since when using the M40 you will often die because you will miss the first time. The bad part of the 50-cal is that it is very inaccurate and when firing from the hip, you want that redicule to be as small as possible. <br>  <br>  The M40 is my favorite gun mainly because it is so INCREDIBLY good for no scoping. It is the most accurate sniper rifle and does a hefty amount of damage from close range to cross-map shots, yes you can do shots across the map with this gun if you are know how to no-scope. The bad part is that it is a bolt-action rifle, which can be a good thing if you like the feeling of it like me, but you will have to reload after every shot which can be a big drawback.<br>  <br>  Perks are very simple, you almost always want to use stopping power and steady aim. <br>  <br>  Stopping power is there so that you can kill the person in one hit 95% of the time you hit them. You will not kill them 100% of the time, which is annoying, but you will kill them a lot. This also goes for the Barret, even though it is strong it will not be as strong as when scoped. If you were to play on hardcore I could understand using slight of hand or double tap, whichever one makes you shoot faster for a bolt action, because you will normally kill them in one shot no matter what.<br>  <br>  For your third perk you ALWAYS want to have steady aim. Steady aim is the backbone of your no scoping class. This gives you a huge advantage to all your guns, whether it be any of the snipers. This will also increase your accuracy when running around, which is something that i recommend you do a lot, which i will explain later.<br>  <br>  For your first perk i would use either bandolier, after you get really good you will start to use up a good amount of ammo. Or use bomb squad, which is dumb most of the time but has saved my life so much i cant even remember.<br>  <br>  The skill that you want to learn when no scoping is something called the "G-shot". This is not the super incredible secret of no scoping that everyone worships and preys to, although there are those who do. This is more of the guidelines of no scoping. It pretty much says that you should always be moving when no scoping. If your about to shoot, flick your gun or body to the left or right. This will cause the game to usually think that you landed a hit when you may not have. This is also like "Strafing". Which is when you quickly move your redicule over the target and the gun "sticks" for a second, allowing you to hit them easier. <br>  <br>  So that is pretty much all the knowledge that I have on the topic of no-scoping. There is a lot of information of the internet on it and I would suggest that you use it. No-scoping is a talent that needs to be practiced regularly so make sure you do so. Never get discouraged that it isnt working because its just a little hard to pull of the first few times, its worth it in the end and you should stick with it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE TO SEE YOU NO SCOPING ME SOMEDAY!!!|`|YTyrK3JGaa	ok<br>  it doesnt matter if you use acog or not...its gonna be the same...<br>  Use the M40A3__Stopping Power___Steady Aim<br>  Steady Aim will do you wonders......then just get them in between the four little lines and boom.....or you can look to the left or right of them then while moving them back into your lines fire...hope this helps and if you wanna play sometime or want me o show you how to do some of this send me a friend request..but let me know your the one from Yahoo answers...<br>  <br>  XxPvtSnoBallxX

X9kNbpnQaa	1) If he attacks with two 2/1's, you can prevent all the damage by blocking one and sacrificing your goblin to kill the other. Since damage hadn't been dealt yet, the second one dies without dealing damage. Since it is still considered blocked, the first one does not deal any damage. However, the first one will survive (combat damage is simultaneous, so if your mog deals combat damage to it the second one has already dealt combat damage to you, so it becomes too late to prevent it).<br>  <br>  2) Yes, you can do this. Combat damage uses the stack, so you attack, he blocks, and you both put your 1 damage on the stack. In response, you can sacrifice your creature and deal 1 damage to him. The combat damage then goes off, killing his 1/1 and fizzling (your guy's already dead).|`|DdkyUEnhaa	Scenario #1:<br>  <br>  The opponent declares to attack with both 2/1 creatures.<br>  You declare to block with the Mogg Fanatic.<br>  You declare "Before damage, sacrifice the Mogg Fanatic to deal 1 damage to the 2/1 that is not being blocked."<br>  <br>  The 2/1 that is being blocked is still considered blocked before going into the damage step, therefore, you lose no life from it. The 2/1 that is being hit with Mogg Fanatics activated ability is now destroyed because it has taken 1 point of damage, therefore, will not deal damage to you either.<br>  <br>  So yes, you can block and sac to not take any damage.<br>  <br>  Scenario #2: <br>  <br>  You declare to attack with Mogg Fanatic.<br>  Your opponent declares to block with a 1/1 creature.<br>  You move to the damage step and both creature deal damage to each other.<br>  You say "While damage is on the stack, sacrifice Mogg Fanatic to deal 1 damage to you"<br>  <br>  The damage is on the stack, meaning that damage will be dealt if one or both of the creatures are still legal targets, therefore, damage will be dealt to the opposing 1/1 regardless if Mogg Fanatic is there or not allowing you to use his activated ability to deal 1 damage to your opponent.|`|d6QY6Rljaa	This is what happens.<br>  <br>  A) You choose to block and use effect. Because damage has not been dealt yet, the attacking monster goes though and the other dies.<br>  <br>  B) You block and dont use the effect. The blocked creature dies and before you can use Moggs effect, it dies, leaving the other token to hit you.<br>  <br>  C) You block a 2/2 creature. You block the creature and try to use his effect. Only one point of damage makes it to the creature, as battle has not resolved yet, making it a 2/1.<br>  <br>  D) You block a 1/1 creature and try to use his effect. Battle has not resolved yet, so you take one point and any chosen target takes one point.

Will take a bit of digging around the internet.|`|vbsNdIluaa	I can connect to my friends on one account, and on the other I cant. My friends have the same problem. There are around 14 of us who want to play together and some of us cant connect to each other and vice versa. Like you said it has it's days and sometimes you can connect to each other. There is no fix to this problem. The only thing you can do is make a new account, this would result in you loosing your progress however. It may be that you cannot connect to a certain player. Try joining partys with different people.
J3kfQtViaa	The internet can be complicated.  But lets start off by going to internet games instead of LAN.  Lan games will look for games on your local network.  Secondly, are you using steam?   I realize that you may be using condition zero but on it's original install.  Which uses WON.net to look for games not steam.  The problem with this is that WON.net is now closed, there are no games to find there anymore and you have to use steam now.  Like i said it's complicated.      So what you would need to do is get steam at steampowered.com and then go to the activate games option once steam is installed (its free) and input your condition zero cd key.  Now you can play condition zero on steam which is the new community.      Anyway, the list of versions of counter-strike is much too long so i will give you important basic computer versions.  Console versions are trash, this game was not made for consoles.    Beta 5.1 - When i started playing (circa april 2000).  The colt m4 had a scope and money was unlimited.  Cs was a mod in the betas.  Version 1.0 was the first official valve release.    Version 1.5 - the last WON.net version before steam was released.  this version would be the oldest and most recognizable to anyone who played early counter-strike    Version 1.6 - The first counter-strike release for steam.  Added some guns and most regretably a riot shield.  Original cs is still at this version today.    Condition zero - what you have.  A very nice overhaul of the original engine. Probably the best version of old counter-strike.    Source - the newest version of counter-strike also widely considered counterstrike2.  Also i think dramatically different from the original, to the point of me not liking it.  The biggest issue i have with the game is that accuracy is random, and that is what drives me crazy as i am an old school player.|`|4b00d9a31d6a0bab2ccf1a1493eca11faa	ARCADE:    Counter-Strike Neo     PC:  Counter-Strike 1: Anthology   Counter-Strike: Condition Zero  Counter-Strike: Source   Half-Life: Counter-Strike    XBOX:    Counter-Strike     Sorry, can't help you with your internet connection.

P6NptCz8aa	Games are getting too easy. Have you ever played the old Super Mario Bros on NES without save state? It's impossible! You had to play those old NES games for like 5 hours a day everyday for a month before you could come close to beating it.     Games these days allow you to "save" which means that no matter how hard the game is, you can still slowly work your way through it. So even though games these days are much longer and have a deeper story, the gameplay is much easier than it used to be.|`|Gb5ADIzZaa	Both i think.|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	both. but video games r getting way way to easy. it takes me 2 days to beat a game anymore.|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	I think gamers are getting lazier so game designer are adapting to what they think we want.|`|hjbKQ7IKaa	were getting better and better bro|`|kIqq7yIAaa	gamers are getting good  games are getting bad    time to put down the controller  turn off the PC     pick up some dice and game the old fashion way  round up your friends  blow the dust off those old D&D books and play  computer games are way too easy to beat so they lose their fun  fast they also cost big $$  consoles fry leaving you to simmer over the lost game data  and cost huge money to replace    a book is a book no moving parts to break  or CPU's to overheat and melt  the DM is a perpetually improving means of keeping the game fun and challenging to all  you can't beat the human brain cause it always comes back for revenge|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	We gmaers are getting too good PLEZZ HELP MEE|`|FsDcrFDiaa	I think it is indeed a combination of both.

Casual games are the biggest sellers right now.  In order to attract more customers to a companies game, they are dumbing the games down to make them more accessable to everyone.  The two biggest examples are Fable 2 and the new Prince of Persia.  You can't die in either game.  There is no feeling that what you will do will have any major consequence on the outcome of the game.  You have your hands held through out the entire game.  There is very little in the way of challenge.  I'm not saying they aren't fun, but they aren't cchallenging  This will continue to be a trend until the majority of the ccostumersshow that they want harder games.|`|ITtolvomaa	The quality is diminishing.    Hi everyone. I found this great website for game save downloads,   among other things. There are so many ps2 and ps3 games with game  saves. Most are completed or mostly. Heres the website:   http://juanpab2.quotaless.com. Oh, and did I mention they are all free!|`|q1Fav370aa	Well, yeah games are getting easier, mostly because developers are making them better. That may seem weird: easier=better, but thats not it at all. It's more like pacing+controls+graphics+story=gamers playing games more continuously, dying less, proggressing further, and getting stuck a lot less in tricky moments. Think of those oldschool platformers with the tricky jumps. Other than Super Mario Bros., most won't be too much fun because jumps are too hard, controls are slippery, they're boring looking, etc. Now think of games like RE4, COD4, Dead Space, Halo 3. Sure it can take a while to pass RE4, but only because the game is long, not because it is hard. You stick with it because it's fun and intriguing. COD4, Halo, Dead Space won't take long, aren't too difficult, but are still challenging, play great, are hella fun, and have so many great moments that stick with you. Not just hard moments, but fun moments or exciting cinemtaic moments. Now think of the memorable moments of old school games. Besides the Princess not being in the castle, most of the moments you think of are going to be hella hard and annoying moments. Moments that make you want to stop playing a game. Most new games don't have those  moments.|`|hDkGc9uAaa	thats the job of programmers to make things new and more challenging  For example: in WoW they offer heroic difficulty dungeons so better players can play at a higher lvl

The system is designed so that it will only accept unique user keys given out by the company in order to prevent piracy. <br>  <br>  There are illegal ways to get access to the game's single player campaign, but if you want to play online you'll need to authentic product key, as with any other modern PC release.

RVpl9ZeIaa	TeleDAD got what it deserves, a kick to the shin that will SLOW IT DOWN. 3x Allure, 3x Malicious, 3x D-Draw was just too fast for everything else to keep up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Zombie, well now they never will really get off the ground.<br>  <br>  <br>  As a GB player, limiting Bestiari will prevent the deck from dominating with speedy Gyzarus plays. This is offset because GB Samnite will be released in Crossroads of Chaos and will more than make up for it with the Rescue Cat combo for a first turn Heraklinos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Shiba-Warrior Taro is decent, it isn't overpowered. If you can't find way to get it off the field, that's your fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, this is the best, most balanced list yet. Lightsworn will finally have a chance to shine now that teleDAD and GBs have been taken down a peg. It will be an interesting format to say the least.<br>  <br>  10/10|`|xB0vOgSwaa	believe it or not zombies weren't all that hurt by this...weel just have to add a couple of armageddon knights and a few foolish burial to get that plaguespreader in the grave...instead of running three mezukies they will just use more il blud and other stuff...also there is an awesome card coming out in the crimson crisis pack...bone crusher.....whenever its special summoned by a zombie effect you can destroy one spell or trap on the field (im so gunna abuse that one) and at the end of the turn its special summoned its destroyed (you can use it for synchro fodder... teledad was severely hurt but it may recover...i think macro monarch is gunna make a comeback with raiza being at two (thats why im building one)........|`|t7c4nZ2xaa	I'm going to run little city now :D|`|IpSKF6CZaa	You are totally right about the TeleDAD decks, this list absolutely destroyed them. I am working on a monarch deck, it looks like monarch decks will also fair much better with the new list. I am surprised they added Chaos Sorcerer to the mix again..........that should be interesting as well. Overall I think this list hit the OTK/FTK decks the most with allure and d draw. Should be an interesting list to play, none of my cards were banned/limited further though so I'm happy :)|`|lS2BWfjWaa	u think glad beast got hurt? and thats the worst? i have my 1300 dollar teledad deck and i play tele dad, oops make that PLAYED teledad and the D**ks at UDE ripped it apart. dad at 1, teleport at 1, ROTA at 1, allure at 2, ddraw at 2 and mali at 2. that seems just kinda overkill on the whole concept of taking down the top deck.<br>  im pretty sure that if teh had taken all that away, but left DAD at 2, teledad would still be ruined, or at least 5 times slower making it more vulnerable to loss. <br>  Lightsworn wasnt hurt @ all bsides losing 1 plaguespreader for those who play LS synchro. waaaaaay unfair. if they were 2 take down DAD they should have @ least taken JD with em, just to make it more fair.  <br>  <br>  altho, with chaos sorecer back in the meta, twilight decks could make a stand <br>  <br>  sigh..... so unfair.

vfhKkiSKaa	Well you can sew all you want but I don't think it will do much good (unless they have some clothes that need mending).  If you want to sue, you can try, but I don't think you will get very far.  It has been well over a year and apparently it hasn't done any permanent damage.  At this point there is no way to prove that you were hurt at all.<br>  <br>  I also have to say, I have ridden The Demon hundreds of times in my life (grew up 15 minutes from the Great America outside of Chicago, plus I still take my kids there every year and don't go to the park without getting on it) and it is one of the smoothest coasters out there.  Plus is is sooooo old school and these days is considered a kiddie coaster.  I don't think you will get too many people believing you got hurt on that ride.<br>  <br>  As for the person above me, it's liable, not reliable (reliable is when somebody can count on you for something).<br>  <br>  I know you are all serious but I had to laugh at this whole thing, you guys need to work on your english...|`|eD7qRBKHaa	There's no such thing as "breaking" your whole upper body.

So, no.|`|ahjOfnIIaa	No, when you get on the ride, you are FULLY reliable to what happens to you, unless you had died, because the cart fell of the track or something crazy but not completely unheard of happened.....|`|43zXRpLYaa	If you were so injured, why did you not inform the employees to call 911? If something was broken did you go to the hospital and get medical care along with x-rays showing the broken bones? And since no one is correcting you, the word is SUE. If you're going to sew, that means you are going to sew a dress or a pair of pants like with a sewing machine.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but it this was serious, you would have asked and received emergency medical care right away, not wait years later and complain about it. You would have had proof that you were injured there at the park on the ride. My guess is it would be a complete waste of time and money for you to even pursue the matter. You have no proof that you were injured there now.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	You have to be kidding me!! You willing got a ride that clearly has danger signs posted warning you not to ride if you have back,neck  or heart problems. This would tell any normal person that there is a risk of injury if you ride this ride. You didn't report it? Why not? Then you went on more rides? <br>   Sure you can sue and most likely you will wind some amount of money.  It makes me sick to see these people win such frivolous lawsuits. It is not the parks fault your back did not hold up to the ride.|`|XE3PCLWNaa	that depends do you have a needle and a thread? (sue not sew..just for the record)

Simply something that HAS to be experienced...we ride it at least twice everytime we go to the park.<br>  <br>  We rode Farenheit at Hershey Park, that has a 97 degree drop, but that coaster sucked.

RBdzQvs9aa	you can try to befriend the dog by feeding him lots of daisies. then put him in your backpack or take him to another place. but you'll eventually need the dog to befriend the hedgehog (one of the goals), so you might as well keep it. Just plant lots of daisies for it to eat, and once its full (test it to see if its full by dropping it on a test animal you don't care about) you can drop it on the hedgehog and they will befriend each other. Animals never eat any other animal they have at least one heart for.<br>  <br>  Get another hedgehog by planting a lot of chestnut trees and leaving the fallen walnuts on the ground. or at least i think its walnuts... its been a while since i played. open the encyclopedia and find out what hedgehogs eat, then plant a lot of that.<br>  <br>  Water lilies will spawn by themselves near some other water plants (yellow nymphoids I think).

Perhaps you should read them again while you have body shop open and do what they do.<br>  <br>  As far as textures are concerned you can make your own with a paint program or if you have a scanner you could scan some fabric you have and get them that way.

When the player's father disappears in mysterious circumstances, the player is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington D.C. to track him down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of other human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that now inhabit the wasteland. The game has an attribute and combat system typical of an action role-playing game but also incorporates elements of first-person shooter and survival horror games.    Following its release, Fallout 3 received a positive response from critics who praised in particular the game's open-ended gameplay and flexible character-levelling system. It has been compared to the 2007 video game BioShock for its setting and use of elements from mid-twentieth century American culture.[12] Critics have noted several flaws in the game, such as the lack of precision in real-time combat and numerous glitches and crashes that can affect the player's progression through the game.[13] That said, public reception was overwhelmingly positive on release according to the game's high sales figures, particularly when compared to previous titles in the Fallout series.[14]  Publication  Score  1UP.com  A[12]  Edge  7/10[64]  Electronic Gaming Monthly  A, B+, A+[65]  Eurogamer  10/10[66]  GameSpot  9/10 (PC)[67]  9/10 (Xbox 360)[68]  8.5/10 (PS3)[69]  GameSpy  5/5[70]  IGN  9.6/10 (Xbox 360)[13]  9.4/10 (PS3)[71]  Official Xbox Magazine  10/10[72]  PC Gamer UK  90%[73]  PC Gamer US  91%[74]  TeamXbox  9.4/10[75]  X-Play  5/5[76]  Aggregate scores  Aggregator  Score  Game Rankings  92.4/100 (Xbox 360)[80]    91.1/100 (PS3)[81]  90.4/100 (PC)[82]  Metacritic  92/100 (PC)[77]    91/100 (PS3)[78]  93/100 (Xbox 360)[79]  MobyGames  91/100 (PC)[83]    91/100 (PS3)[84]  93/100 (Xbox 360)[85]|`|4KwR8WKlaa	It's exactly like Morrowind but instead of the fantasy theme its the nuclear fallout. The format is exactly the same. I really like it. It can be really addicting. So if you've played Elder Scrolls III and you loved it, this game's only a stone throws away.|`|efqoz08qaa	Well first is if you liked oblivion there is a good chance you'll like this considering it uses the same engine. I found the game quite fun and the world is huge and detailed, 9.8km x 9.8km i believe. Most combat is done ranged, with the ability to pause time and target body parts. this was really fun to do, i would cripple someones leg and as they tried to run away I would come up behind them with a baseball bat and blugeon them to death. the game is extremely violent and gory. the downside being that is is still a bit buggy with freezes and people falling through the world and people dissappearing. I thought it was a very good game with awesome side quests and a good main story.|`|8cdXNemVaa	Yeah it's a great game, it's really going to take you some time to get everything 100%, so if you like RPG and you like shooters it's the game for you.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	It is a very good game, a mix of role-playing and third/first person shooter.  It is plagued with its share of bugs, which is the main drawback of the game, but that is probably due to the sheer size of the post-apocalyptic world you are given to explore, and the fact that you can, for the most part,  do things in a non-linear fashion.  If you choose to follow the main story line only and not undertake any side quests you could possibly "finish" the game in about 40 hours of game play, however if you choose to explore all the side quests then you could easily be playing for 200+hours.  In other words, excellent value for your money.|`|tL9SuAWbaa	I think it is really good. I like how it is a shooter...there are a lot of side quest and the graphics and game play is great. The only downfall that I don't like about it is you can't finish the main quest line and then keep playing...once you finish it is done. Other than that I would highly recommend it.|`|AA10942089	I'll give the cliched answer;    "Oblivion with guns."    If you've played Oblivion or anything like it, you'll probably like this.

bfsym1dsaa	Insert one of the 3rd Gen. GBA games (Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, Emerald versions) into the GBA Slot, and at the main menu of your DS game, you can select 6 Pokemon to be transferred from your 3rd Gen. game over to your current game. Once they're transferred, you can catch them at the Pal Park.|`|VlsaWHebaa	You can only get it when you see every pokemon on the sinnoh pokedex. (If you battle every trainer then you have no problem doing this). The Pal Park helps you transfer pokemon from GBA (Emeral, Saphire, Ruby etc.) and transfer it to Diamond/Pearl. When you get the Pal Park, it should say so on the menu screen (Before you play the pokemon and the GBA game has to be on the DS when your doing this). You can only transfer 6 pokemon (They can't have HM moves like surf, fly etc.) and then when you transfer them, you start the game and go to Pal Park in the game diamond/pearl and you have to catch the pokemon you transfer (they will be exactly desame so don't worry) and when you trow them the pokeball they give you, it always catches the pokemon no matter what. You get points on how fast you capture all 6 pokemon.<br>  <br>  If you transfer a pokemon like totodile, it would be found on the pound area (you must surf round for it to appear.)|`|Wnuqsc9saa	Well, simply the Pal Park is if you have: Emerald, Ruby, FireRed, LeafGreen, or Sapphire. Then you would be able to permanently transfer your Pokemon from any of the four versions to your Diamond/Pearl version. You unlock Pal Park by beating the game and I think you have to see a certain number of Pokemon...and yes, you transfer then catch it again. Once you run into the Pokemon in Pal Park then you are automatically able to throw the ball one time and it is caught for good. But you can only transfer 6 Pokemon for every 24 hours. That's the bad thing about it. Then again it gives you something to look forward to. The legendary Pokemon are hard to find, but don't ever give up!! Always make sure you have a Pokemon that knows Surf go into Pal Park with you!! Good luck with it!!  =D|`|ATvI1WmKaa	Pal Park is a way of obtaining Pokemon in a GBA game that would be otherwise impossible or very difficult to obtain.  For example, Groudon, Kyogre, or one of the starters.<br>  <br>  To unlock it, you have to have gotten the National Dex (Seen every pokemon in Sinnoh, including Giratina, both Dialga and Palkia, and the three lake pokemon.  There's an old lady in Celestic Town thatll show you a picture of either Dialga or Palkia, depending on which one you have, to complete your regular pokedex without having to trade or something.  Talk to Prof. Birch and he'll give you the Nat. Dex after you've seen every pokemon in the region)<br>  <br>  Once Pal Park is unlocked, make sure the GBA game you are extracting from is in the slot, than save and restart the game.  In the menu after the title screen, you should be able to choose to "migrate pokemon from [GBA game]".  You can migrate six pokemon a day (they must be SIX.  Not seven, not two, six.), and note that these are moving the pokemon, not copying them.  They'll disappear from your GBA game if you migrate them to your DS card.  Also note that messing with the DS clock won't work either, and might actually extend the amount of time you have to wait.  There are a few guidelines for what Pokemon can be transferred, as well. Off the top of my head, I can only recall that you CANNOT transfer any pokemon that have HMs.  You can however give them items.<br>  <br>  Once they've been migrated, load your game up and go to Pal Park, where you can participate in a Catching Show to capture all six of the pokemon you migrated.  You won't be able to migrate anymore pokemon until you catch the ones that you already have loaded.  You'll be given special Pokeballs to capture them with that will capture them without fail (like a Master Ball).  Depending on their type, they will be found in various areas and you might need one or two HMs (namely Surf) to get all of them.  You must capture all six to end the Catch Show.  Once you finish, the announcer will rate you and give you a point score, based on various factors such as the pokemon's types and rarity, and also give you a berry.<br>  <br>  As for your second question, that depends entirely on the Pokemon.   For example, you mentioned Totodile, which cannot be obtained by normal means within the game.  However, if you're patient, most, if not every pokemon can be obtained from others via the online trading center in Jubilife City.<br>  <br>  Hope you found this helpful.
Wmn5Bh1Zaa	I think fishing does give a higher number of genies, but I don't know for sure.  I got 99 woodcutting and got 363 nests.  So, lets say that 1/3 of my random events while woodcutting was a nest - that means I got 1,000 random events, which would probably be at least 100 genies.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind the exam random event as well.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

eypgm5xCaa	Shedinja<br>  Shedinja is not really a strong pokemon its just very hard to kill since of wondergaurd. But heres a good strategies in a double battle have shedninja out and a pokemon that has good deffence and has the move skillswap.Alright now use skillswap at shedinja then get shedinija back in his Pokeball and take out spiritomb not use skillswap again on spiritomb and he will be unbeatable.Reason why is because Spiritomb has no move that is super effective against him so when you give him the ability wonderguard which only lets super effective moves hit. Since nothing is super effective against spiritomb he will be an undeafeatable.<br>  I reccoment to give shedinja the move protect just in case there is a pokemon who can hit on him with a super effective move.<br>  <br>                                            Metagross<br>  With mettagross you have to remember it is a steel/psychic so gte the best out of it.Big weakness is earthquake so get the move magnet rise.<br>  Psychic is recommended. Earthquake is preffered by me it is strong & doesnt miss.It can actually know the move shadowball which I reccomend for any psychic pokemon wont get in your way.<br>  <br>  This is pearsonally what I think is good for both of the Pokemon
