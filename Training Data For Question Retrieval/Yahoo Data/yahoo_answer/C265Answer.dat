AA10008300	A young man named Gordon bought a horse from an old farmer for $10    The farmer agreed to deliver the horse the next day, but when the farmer drove up he said, 'Sorry son, but I have some bad news... the horse is on my truck, but unfortunately he's dead.'    Gordon replied, 'Well then, just give me my money back.'    The farmer said, 'I can't do that, because I've spent it already.'    Gordon said, 'OK then, we'll just unload the horse anyway.'    The farmer asked, 'What are you going to do with him?'    Gordon answered, 'I'm going to raffle him off.'  To which the farmer exclaimed, 'Surely you can't raffle off a dead horse!'    But Gordon, with a wicked smile on his face said, 'Of course I can, you watch me.  I just won't bother to tell anybody that he's dead.'    A month later the farmer met up with Gordon and asked, 'What happened with that dead horse?'    Gordon said, 'I raffled him off, sold 500 tickets at $1 a piece, and made a huge, fat profit!!'    Totally amazed, the farmer asked, 'Didn't anyone complain that you had stolen their money because you lied about the horse being dead?'    To which Gordon replied, 'The only guy who found out about the horse being dead was the raffle winner when he came to claim his prize. So I gave him his $1 raffle ticket money back plus an extra $20, which as you know is double the going rate for a horse, so he thought I was a great guy!!'    Gordon grew up and eventually became the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and no matter how many times he lied, or how much money he stole from the British voters, as long as he gave them back some of the stolen money, most of them, unfortunately, still thought he was a great guy.    The moral of this story is that, if you think Gordon is about to play fair and do something for the everyday people of the country for once in his miserable, lying life, think again my friend, because you'll be better off flogging a dead horse !!!!|`|KOsGtal8aa	buy a rope.|`|Cw4ylaUCaa	keep it to buy food while i'm searching for any job|`|PULQiKsJaa	buy alcohol and get drunk|`|VFMt6g2iaa	Gamble! =)|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Buy a prostitute|`|d23F89ECaa	Go to the bar, buy a beer and leave a good tip.

15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	It depends how many you intend to teach in a group. The answer is probably yes; all manner of trainers and tutors are now expected to have at least a basic teaching qualification.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	That's awesome! I wish I could learn. I have a guitar but no clue how to pay it. I know notes cuz I play the flute but when it comes to string instruments, my fingers get confused. lol. Anyways, you don't need qualification to teach. Just people willing to learn. Good luck to you!|`|MHg9JhEKaa	You don't have to have any qualifications, so long as you make that clear to potential pupils. I kind of assume you've already had an enhanced CRB check if you're working with kids, yes?     Yes you can put them through their grades too.     How much you charge is up to you. 15 per hour would be reasonable in my opinion, for individual tuition, perhaps less for groups.|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	I'd like to teach the world to sing ... (fill in the rest.Cheers.)|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Since parents are approaching you, then your qualifications in the form of a degree (or lack thereof) don't matter. Their kids have already been learning from you and feel your lessons are valuable or they wouldn't have asked.     HOW valuable is something you'll determine by placing phone calls to other people listed in the phone book who offer lessons. Find out the qualifications of the teacher (how long have they been teaching? are they in a band currently? Studio musician? What makes them "better" at guitar enough that they should teach others?) and where the lessons would be happening. I would imagine that people who have a dedicated space (a storefront with a "Bob's Guitar Lessons" sign) can charge more than those who either go to their pupil's homes or have their pupil's come to theirs.
d23F89ECaa	That's actually possible.    I had a light that kept turning on and off on it's own in my old house.  It took almost a year before my wife noticed our lights were turning on an off at the same time as the neighbour's washroom light.  We called them up and asked them to test it out.  It worked.  We had it looked at and there was a short somewhere between where the power goes into our two houses.    As for the mystery switch, I have one where I live now.  Still don't know what it's for but I opened it up once and there are indeed wires going to it.  One day I'll figure it out.|`|OxaonF5aaa	No i don't think so|`|AA10182088	LOL!!!!

And every now and then we'd just keep flicking it on and off to see if we could notice anything happen. Then a man from the pub across the road said the light on the wall outside kept flashing... Oops.|`|950f09b4f4e23c03823f94b1474abdedaa	Hehehe, thats funny, you have a ghost light! I don't have that in my place, but all I can say is, good luck on finding out what it does! :-)|`|0RcnOgA7aa	I have four|`|1ZVtTII8aa	I have one in my room, I have noooo idea what it could be for!|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	so its you thats turning my bathroom light on and off lol    thought it was a ghost ha ha tee hee  have a nice day ;---)|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	My x boyfriend has one at the bottom of the stairs going into the kitchen..for months we tried to figure it out..nope no answer yet..i even walked around the house to see if it was for an outside light..nothing|`|bYWTE40Vaa	It might be for an outside light? Or the light could be burnt out   I have a switch in my kitchen and no clue what its for whatsoever!

Look at the other answers and see which one is most opposite from yours...and it's usually ppl who answer after you.  It's such a stupid thing to do -- give thumbs down if the question is asking for an opinion.  Everyone's entitled to think what they want.  What a boring world if everyone felt/thought/acted the same exact way.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Why? What would you do if you found out who did it anyways? I wish I could thumbs down your question...FAIL!
OXleDYVQaa	Good question actually. According to yahoo there are 90 million of us using Y/A and it seems all have a right to ask, and in P&S especially there may be Q's not so socially relevant, or world changing, BUT,    We all hopefully have freedom of choice to ignore or answer, and many are just here to have some fun.    I doubt many of us are seriously here to "waste" time, but maybe sometimes "silence is golden."    Dallas|`|pwMLaW2Baa	hey, points are points!

I try not to though. I trust my husband 100% but I still hate it when other women flirt with him or hit on him. Why does this irritate me?! I guess it's be worse if I didn't get jealous.

hk4v0G6faa	I like Casey with Allison too.  I wasn't really a fan at first because I was a bit tired of the Stewart/Hugh's feud.  It is so out played.  Yet, the slow pace of Casey and Allison has let me ease into their relationship.  It has been awhile sense ATWT has just let a story play out instead of forcing it along.  Casey and Allison's friendship has been a pleasure to watch and this couple is ready for the next step. I hope it happens.  Although with Matt back and Emily and Jade up to no good, it doesn't look like it will happen soon.      On a side note, I really feel like they need to let Casey's character grow a bit.  I do not like the fact they act like just because you have gone to prison and don't have a college degree the only option is a janitor.  I would like to see Casey go into some sort of trade like construction, plumbing, an electrician, etc. or even better let him get back into music like he was before he went to jail.  I think it would take the "woe's is me" out of him.|`|30r4coInaa	Emily!  That was so hot!  I remember when he was under her desk... I wish they continued that storyline.

AA11101361	Some of it is based in fact.  Mary really did have a relationship with Henry.  Her son was born after the relationship ended and there was minor speculation that it was Henry's.  In the end, it was accepted that the son was Mary's husband's.  It is possible that her first child, a daughter, was Henry's.  Mary was actually the bad, not as pretty one.  She had been kicked out of the French court, where she and Anne had been sent as part of their education (Anne actually spent most of her childhood and young adulthood in various European courts), because she behaved inappropriately with men. When Anne finally came back, she was the toast of the court, worldly, European, sophisticated, beautiful, intelligent and outspoken.  George was accused of incest and witchcraft along with Anne.  Another 5 men were accused of adultery.  Probably, it never happened.  Anne lost that baby after Henry had been severley injured in a joust, it was stress since he was expected to die (it was the injuries from the joust that helped him down the road to obesity).  She was to smart to do anything that would get herself in trouble, she just couldn't avoid being set up by the king.  The kid was supposed to be Elizabeth, but Mary probably never saw her.  Mary had been disowned not long after Elizabeth's birth for marrying a commoner.  Anne had sent her some money and Mary died a few years after Anne and George's executions have never visited or written to her imprisoned siblings.  Elizabeth was raised by a governess, Kat Ashley, and her last stepmother Catherine Parr.|`|0A92vQDBaa	Surprisingly most of this movie is based on fact. The only thing that isn't is that Henry was actually very fat. Mary did have a son and relations with Henry and Mary ended up with Elizabeth because she is sister to Ann and Ann asked for her to take care of her. Oh and he wasn't mean enough.

z4D4rKEtaa	very good match...its the opposite sign. Relations will be intense and if there is trust...can be magical. Each sign needs to respect each other differences. ANYTHING CAN WORK IF COMMITTED!|`|QjfsEXSOaa	Yes, but theres going to a lot of disagreement though, but they'll balance each other out, my advice to you is to not make her jealous and don't cross cuz she doesn't forget or forgive.|`|vFaPZU0Maa	its not a good match i dated a Taurus he was really romantic which i loved but he was always suck up which Scorpios hate and we both got jealous and possessive of each other|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I'm taurus .. my first love was a Scorpio it will probably be intense but i liked that .. Lots of jealousy on both parts.|`|vDAfx6kOaa	Taurus and Scorpio are a no go<br>  its because Scorpio is finicky and Taurus is stubborn<br>  its typically a Taurus that would pursue a Scorpio and will spend alot of time trying to win them over if they do at all. If she wants your stability then she will settle down, if she doesn't you might be waiting a while.<br>  I am a taurus and the guy that im head over heals for is a scorpio <br>  thats why I know.<br>  were best friends  ... as the stars predict|`|UhbyuzuXaa	Scorpio women have it all! Make it work!|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am a scorpio and he was a taurus, there was the magnetic chemistry and attraction that you hear about with these two signs but he was degrading and angry all the time.  If he hadn't been that way I would have been head over heals for him.  <br>  <br>  My old boss was a Taurus and I heard he had a thing for me. Honestly if he hadn't been married and we were both single that could have gone somewhere. We were so alike and got along great.  I had so much respect for him.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|z1PPzUkQaa	In general, that would be a very passionate match. But you also want to look at some of your other signs. The more you know, the better.

97iJN1Csaa	TMZ is messed up.<br>  They should'nt be posting people's pictures like that.<br>  Rumors were that she has a black eye no where in that picture does she have a black eye so my guess is that that pic has been a little "photoshoped" but then again that is solely based on my opinion...Is anyone looking at this face as swollen from crying.. is anyone wonder what she was hit with... Does anyone else see the two slightly curved marks/bruises on the side of her head over her eyes. These are some kind of impression and not made with a hand or fist... Something strange is going on. As light as she is she should be purple and blue all over.... This is not a horrific beating...|`|K4J6f1e0aa	That article doesn't say that they aren't completely fake. It says that they MIGHT be.

Me and the husband just talked about how Disney seems to produce wayyyy more stars then Nick.  Nickolodeon has Nick Cannon (basically famous for being Mr. Carey) and Kenan Thompson (who moved to Saturday Night Live).  Disney has Raven Symone, Shia Leouf, and so on.  So sad for Nick :-(|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	nicklelodeon screwed themselves when they stopped playing:<br>  rocko's modern life<br>  doug<br>  angry beavers<br>  red and stimpy<br>  aaahh! real monster<br>  rugrats<br>  <br>  and all those other shows.<br>  i don't know what taina is...|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I loved that show.

mCbhjcLuaa	I didn't like them or Ike Turner so figure it out.<br>  And it is about time.|`|BWVDKixeaa	Firstly I think people almost expected that Bobby Brown would be the kind of person who might do something like that.  Most people are in shock that Chris Brown would even think about it.  Fact is that Bobby Brown never had a good guy image.  It was mentioned otherwise you and I would not have heard about it.  I think there was a backlash but their whole relationship was very destructive.  The Browns both had serious drug problems.  It was almost a given that there would be abuse.  Where is Chris's drug problem? People are looking for something that might explain why.  Of course it doesn't matter who the abuser is let alone famous or not.

Maybe if you REALLY proved yourself, but otherwise, there would be a low chance of getting back to the way things were.

They could never even put forth 3 songs, not to mention an entire album. Mustaine and Ulrich would fist-fighting all the time, Gallagher and Bono would be in a screaming match about how their own band is so much better than each other's, and Axl Rose would be in a corner planning everything out, and yelling $#^% at everyone when they don't do exactly like he wants.<br>  <br>  There's no room even for the most humble bassist in there, as he would be eaten alive by the others.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: It's fairly obvious.

cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	yes for Nikki and Victor and they got rid of Brad because of budget cuts they say but they keep hiring new actors that are really not as good as Brad  I think they made a BIG mistake getting rid of him they could of come up with some good story lines for him!|`|WJW4qOlUaa	They keep getting rid of these people due to budget cuts but they keep bringing someone else in!!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think you are right.  I wasn't a Brad fan ,but he did  bring excitement to the show.Someone else could of went,|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	no i don't think so, they need new faces and they need new people so that everyone will quit sleeping with everybody else and so they don't keep breaking up and then getting back together again 50 million times. yes, they do drag the story lines on and on and on so long that it gets boring. i hope neither nikki and victor nor sharon and nick get back together. they are getting old.|`|AA11111233	I can certainly do without Adam and perhaps Billy, but Amber, Cane and Chloe are really growing on me.  Just replace the actress who plays Lily with someone more talented, and I'll be happy.  Yes, they drag storylines along, but I think I would prefer this over just dropping storylines after a certain number of episodes, like Lynn Marie Latham did - especially when the loose ends haven't been tied up at that point.  <br>  <br>  I don't think Victor and Nikki will get back together... he verbally and emotionally abused her too many times, and I was afraid it would lead to physical abuse.  Abuse towards women - especially not in cases where the man is just defending himself - is a problem in this society, and the writers should not be glorifying this.  Why would she want to go back for more?  And I HOPE that Nick and Sharon DO NOT get back together!  They are the most boring couple in the hiostory of soaps, and their reunion will result in more fights, lying, secrets, cheating, finger-pointing, blame game, "revenge sex" and everything else that viewers had to put up with in the first round, especially since Nick is going through a womanizing phase.  Plus, Sharon Case is such a lousy actress, she will dumb down Joshua Morrow very quickly and make him a back burner actor that he was not when he was paired with Michelle Stafford.
X584C3izaa	It's really low of Chris to do something like this, he had a clean image(or so it seemed) and he was a role model for young people.  Majority of his fans are females, so after this, i'm sure a lot of his fans are really upset and shocked.  Rihanna should just leave him, if a guy loves you he wouldn't disrespect you at all, and that includes abuse(mental, physical, and emotional).|`|dejqLjaLaa	I think that's what EVERYBODY is talking about.

cNtPy2S2aa	There are theories that "toffee-nosed" (or "toff", and meaning snobbish; pretentiously superior) comes from "tuft" - a gold tassel on a cap worn by titled student at Oxford University. But more credibly - if less tastefully - the origin appears to derive from the unsightly brown droplets that dripped from a gentleman's nose after taking snuff - which of course was only taken by the "upper class". (Ref: Sue Arnold's book Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Dandy [2006])|`|5rO6l7GDaa	"It's origin is unknown; some say it's from 'tuft', the tassel on the caps of aristocratic Victorian undergraduates.

tuATxHsVaa	Aha... upright pianos. Yes, they make good student pianos. Their upright pianos are priced well and should last you a long time. <br>  <br>  As far as being great for Classical music... well, that's a tough call. You would be hard pressed to say that any upright piano is good for Classical music. It's the sound of a baby grand, or a grand, that most Classical musicians are after.<br>  <br>  Yamaha upright pianos are wonderful instruments. They are a good value. They are the standard practice vehicle for many students on a budget.<br>  <br>  You can, quite often, find used P22 models and other Yamaha uprights for $500 to $1,000. Make sure they are playable before you buy.<br>  <br>  After all - why would you splurge on an upright piano? Sure, you could get more expensive uprights; but, when you take your playing to that highest level... you are going to want/need a baby grand. The action of a baby grand is entirely different (in feel) from that of an upright. The sound is... well, much better on a baby grand. This is, of course, assuming that your baby grand was properly voiced and maintained. There are plenty of baby grands out there that I wouldn't poke with a stick.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Good brand of what? <br>  Are we talking about wind instruments, string instruments, brass instruments, pianos, percussion?<br>  <br>  Audio components, "stereo" systems, speakers ... where are you going with this?|`|DMpVSHvXaa	For what instrument?<br>  <br>  I play Yamaha clarinets and have no problems with them.|`|mrF5N1ujaa	yamaha is a basic, cheap brand.  you can play classical music with them but they are definately not good for anything|`|CrAwmz65aa	I had a friend who thought that they made good recorders but lousy pianos.|`|cYuWbvSKaa	Yes it is but I would think that Armstrong is the best.|`|rrMYRLpXaa	For INSTRUMENTS, you mean?<br>  <br>  Yamaha grand pianos are the standard quality pianos. If you want a high quality one, get a Steinway or Bluthner.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	The Yamaha Grand Pianos, are very good instruments and excellent for a classical pianist.|`|025wasRZaa	How can yamaha be a good brand for classical music?|`|AA10809722	for what it's worth, they make great trumpets...

The truth is i dont no him and neither does his Fans. If he sees the error of his ways then he should get a second chance. But the difference now is that he's tainted. So, he can live a normal life with a big asterisk next to his name. It's sad though, i really respected him.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	Nope. Let's be honest, he's a d-bag.

E7xOBER4aa	Back to the future movies are KICK *** seriously you have to watch em all to get the story because they continue.<br>  <br>  Seriously they are so awesome and there not like FULL ON science fiction and it's kinda action/comedy/science fiction<br>  <br>  Michael J Fox is a really great actor too|`|JmNaXTjqaa	they are a classic soo good and entertaing for all<br>  i would deffinetly recommend watching all 3 of them <br>  shame they didnt bring out a few more|`|KnhC7FG8aa	i watched the first back to the future today actually and i really enjoyed it|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	go get the box  set <br>  they are great<br>  almost classics now<br>  funny with sci'fi edge to it|`|yGi6v5XKaa	yes they definitelt are you haven't lived until you've seen them and i'm just a kid|`|K2TqDCEsaa	i liked it but don't i mean DONT WATCH WITH KIDS. it kusses|`|kyEPS7xCaa	I only liked the 1st one.  They are supposed to be comedies, but only the 1st one was really original.  The second and 3rd are continuous, at the end of the 2nd, it says to be continued, I hated that.<br>  <br>  They go into the future and everything gets messed up.  Then they go to the Western days, it kind of got ridiculous and complicated.|`|b5ff1a7351518399ad114718fdc0a8f3aa	they are classics! a boy has a friend who happens to be a scientist inventing a time machine, unique because its a delorean car. after travelling to the past, history is accidentally altered so that the boys parents never meet, and so he is either never born or his life is very different. The majority of the 3 movies are spent trying to change the past so that the present is brought back to the way it was at the beginning of the movie, or set being stuck in the future trying to get the stolen time machine back, so he can return to the present to have a life as close to what was once considered normal. although the first movie is undoubtably the best one and the most serious in tone, they all have their own unique ideas. The simple lightning animation for the car itself travelling back to the past still looks good. if you enjoyed watching part of one, you wont be disappointed with all 3 films if you can get the box set for a good price from ebay or amazon, which should be quite easy to find. if you are not bothered about extras, you could always seek out the first film on its own. Since all the movies have been out on dvd for a while now, there should not be a major difference when comparing buying all 3 seperately or individually

There's been several instances of dry taco sauce, bbq sauce, etc. on the keyboard and mousepad and now there's a huge blotch of whatever-the-hell-you-call-it on the corner of the keyboard.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Haha...

In addition to the recycled items, you can also cut out pictures from old magazines of your favorite celebrities! That way, the magazines won't go to waste. Afterwards, take apart your person and recycle everything properly. Hope I helped, or at least inspired some creativity. Good Luck! :)|`|x84SWsL6aa	make a short dvd talking abit about and showming your music collection, movie collection, and why you believe going green is good.<br>  <br>  WOOOO GO GREEENN!

You'll still be the same knowledgeable Veg contact that i would eat glue for. ;P<br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  Pre-judgments can be harsh.

6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I think you can have a catchy tune crap lyrics and it be good like the promise by Girls Aloud do like that (oh the shame)<br>  Then you can have rubbish tune good lyrics for me it is the a bit of both to be honest Ryhdian has a song on his Album The prayer and has both|`|mGvSEY6Saa	the lyrics<br>  a song isnt good unless it has good lyrics that you can relate to, thats what makes it magic :D|`|iXvy2Or2aa	probably tune but emotionally lyrics|`|aKhZNd7daa	For me it's got to be the tune first Bex and then add the lyrics !|`|bL3Q4u8aaa	Definitely the tune because when you first hear a song, you pay attention to the beat. If the tune was boring you wouldn't want to hear it no matter what the lyrics were, but I'm not saying the lyrics aren't important because if they weren't they would say stupid things then. But again, the tune is the most important because they also have to match what the lyrics say.|`|Uyiw7bECaa	The tune makes it catchy, the lyrics make it inspirational or helpful.<br>  <br>  I think if you have patience then the lyrics could be because you could listen to an average song and realise the lyrics which could make it amazing.<br>  <br>  If you are impatient and dont listen to lyrics then it would be the tune.|`|mAjyNjV5aa	<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Guide-Serious-Singers-Musicians/dp/B0018JKMNW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235215878&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Guide-...</a><br>  <br>  This book shows you how to write meaningful lyrics it is written with great style too.  hope it helps you as it did me|`|B3cPFhssaa	If a song has good guitar - then i'm hooked,this is probably because i play guitar though.<br>  I reckon a combination of both really,good tune but suckish lyrics and vice versa wouldn't really work out well.|`|mDkrW9Odaa	bit of both . but deep lyrics are always good =) but it also have to sound good for peopl to like it. so i think what it sounds like is more important then what its about. <br>  so i would say the TUNE. xx|`|lYkvps54aa	lyrics can mean so much to so many different people, but the tune can be emotive too.|`|a398ea473f595655ea49d67d2d328fb1aa	Tune first, lyrics second!|`|b3S2FImdaa	both|`|K9xjJ1khaa	both , sometimes the tune may be boring but the lyrics can be nice, or the other way around.. <br>  <br>  but usually it's the tune that gets people's attention|`|JSp0JIBjaa	both ususally. vida la viva has particulary boring lyrics, but a catchy tune. but some songs have both like circus.|`|Rq1o0Ahsaa	Both you can have a decent song without both but you need the lyrics first normally, but still both|`|uPI7QSoGaa	Can be either. But the best and most popular songs are the ones with a 'hook' like a small bit of tune. e.g the strings in 'Toxic'|`|hpkOeOLyaa	It's the tune for me.|`|wmBK9uASaa	Tune first lyrics second|`|AA10077992	It must have a catchy tune first. Once I've started humming the tune, I listen to the words which are often quite silly but once the tune is in your head- you're hooked !

jUiCcrnKaa	My history got teacher got a erection last year,he was standing behind a table so he kinda stooped down a little and then he tried to hold a folder casually in front of him.<br>  <br>  didn't really work though,it was really obvious. lmao<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and some other time,for this fund raising thing. we had a sponge the teacher event. and like some kid actually threw a bucket filled with water at him,and it like hit his neck and he started screwing. LOL.|`|lGSUToFQaa	during on of our concerts my choir teacher backed right off the stage in the middle of the nationals, he was cuing us to bow before he bowed only they had moved the bleachers we stood on up and he didn't know. and he backed right off the stage, i think we won because of sympathy for him, he broke his shoulder and elbow.<br>  <br>  then my art teacher in Jr high, she was always leaving to go across the hall in the ROTC room well one day she came back to class and her dress was tucked in her panties, we were her first class and no one told her till lunch time. she was wearing these big polka dot panties, it was hilarious|`|XXbINMWzaa	This was about 20 years ago when I was in high school.  We had a substitute teacher who had really bad dandruff.  He was wearing a black suit and his jacket was covered with white flakes.  He asked the question "What does this country need today?"  And someone answered "A Dust Buster".<br>  <br>  And also one time a math teacher got mad at this kid and yelled at him, and pounded his hand down on the overhead projector and broke the thing.  All we saw was shattered glass on the screen.  That was funny.<br>  <br>  Why the hate?|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	My music teacher /choir director was legally blind. He was always in somekind of trouble. But one time while we were rehearsing for the Christmas cantata, we did it on the stage and as they were setting the props for the play, they removed the pulpit and some of the furniture he was used to see  in front of him. (he only saw outlines). SO he thought he was too far forwards, and kept going backwards while directing and fell of the platform in the middle of the song. At that point the whole choir took an undirected gasp, the platform was quite high, perhaps 4-5 feet high. The next second we were all quiet, and then we heard him say: I'm ok! And the next undirected sound was of laughter, it was exploding out of us! I felt so bad for the guy, legally blind and all, but the gig was so hilarious, nobody could keep the laughter in! LOL|`|15251965e7a22606112c1db04af6445faa	My teacher mr. navetta had cancer but he was being funny anyways.<br>  He has no idea there is a cord laying on the floor so he starts dancing around (god knows why) and he falls. and then he starts to sing and everyone made fun of him for the rest of the day. He was embarrassed his face turned really red. But that's when he started embarrassing my friends and omg he was funny.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	She messed up her hair without knowing it so it was sticking up like peacock feathers.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, she didn't quite get why we were laughing.|`|Bwqjrijhaa	My 7th grade English teacher had her wig blow off and fly into a mud puddle during recess one day.  It was one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen.......|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	We were at the public pools and the LITTLE kids had just gotten out. and the water had literally turned yellow!!! lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  So we were waiting while they refilled it and filted it.<br>  We were sitting with out backs to the pool and our teachers was watching them refill it (don't ask why) and all of a sudden we heard a huge splash and turned around, she had slipped and fallen into the *pee*.<br>  <br>  lmao<br>  <br>  the next day and the rest of the month every time she came into the class room we would all at the same time go , psssssssssss. as to make the sound of pee.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  and one day she came to school wearing a yellow dress and we all did it again but MUCH louder.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  kinda mean, but super funny at the time.|`|UyHLvhloaa	It's not considered "embarassing" but it iss unusual that in 10th grade I had a math teacher who had Tourette Syndrome and so he would make random noises and sounds all day long  in the middle of his lessons becuase of it, but ironically he was the BEST math teacher I've ever had. He was such a nice person and very funny, we all loved him :)<br>  <br>  <3|`|YCUJMvWQaa	my 10th grade teacher would always talk and all her students would always say "SHUT UP AND TECH US SOMETHING" and the teacher goes "YOU KNOW WHAT IM SICK OF YOU ALWAYS YELLING AT ME IM YOUR TEACHER DAMM*T AND I WILL DO WHAT EVER AHJU HUHUH OJ AHYA AHAH ' cuz a bug  went into her mouth and she was like OMG THAT WAS GROSS and the bug falls on the floor and she steps on it and then she walks away mad and she starts cussing at the bug haha<br>  its like shes weird who yells at a bug? l.ol|`|O0S189PQaa	my 5th grade teacher sat in pencil shavings and they were on her a$$ and she was walking around with them on most of the day lol.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	my orchestra teacher climbed up on a table to conduct, only to fall off 3 beats later|`|puXPrxfJaa	my tech cuzzes right in front of us <br>  but hes from shotland  (i cant spell that )<br>  but he said that its not a cuzz word there<br>  <br>  bull crap  :P|`|gDF7WBelaa	My Social Studies Teacher Was in the bathroom and we were talking at the sinks then we heard like A Big splashh..

He likes to pass it around or try to through it over the lights. One day he tried to do just that and it fell short. It his the clock, the clock fell and the glass shattered. All the other SS teachers came to investigate.<br>  <br>  Don't know if this was embarrassing but it sure was funny|`|Zbrg4q7baa	My science teacher was doing an experiment & somehow set her sleeve on fire, so she ran down the class to one of the sinks and soaked herself trying to get the flame out. Her top was white so it went see through from the water & one sleeve was half off.|`|THvfGib9aa	my science teacher is like a thousand and had a blue been explode in his pocket and just to mess with him people were patting him on the back with chalk on there hands, cuz he was wearing a black shirt. haha.|`|Cpmfx6L9aa	She was laughing at the class clown while trying to discipline him and pi$$ed herself.

There are no 'special gifts' that allow you to be better at something than anyone else besides some genetic differences that make certain things easier for some people, e.g. longer fingers help with playing many instruments.

Many people see someone who is amazing at what they do like a great musician, or a great sportsperson and they assume there's some kind of gift.

That he ran away to another country. That he had another kid, even though he couldn't look after the ones he already had. That my mum took his stupid *** back. <br>  None of it mattered. Because he turned his back when I needed him the most. That was the first cut, and it was the deepest. I can't forgive it, or forget it.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be morbid, but this song helped me throught this time.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	That whoever wrote it has felt a bit of pain in love !|`|AA11648899	It's pretty self-evident.<br>  <br>  It means the first time you're hurt it's the worst.<br>  <br>  From that point forward you prepare yourself.|`|92yiQo7uaa	First love is the most painful when it ends.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	it means that music artist is an emo|`|ehgLIx2Raa	man i love cat stevens, one of my favorite artist

As a friend, I'd be having a chat to her about her sexual exploits and how it made you feel. My mother always told me that your life is like walking in the snow. Be careful where you tread because every step will show.

Ditch her!|`|hFVPEkWjaa	don't let her touch u|`|YOGPspsgaa	How old was the guy dude? It's ok to be a bit mad about it but don't blame it all on her. The guy must've like pressured her you know? Did she herself tell you about this? Find out the details. She's your best friend. People make mistakes but at least she didn't have sex. She better pray the guy doesn't tell everyone and have her labeled as a s l u t... Either way it was a bad decision on her part. :\|`|K1LGV0Kkaa	Awww. You sound like a good friend for caring. <br>  <br>  But I guess you should be mad. She's only 13 and she's your bestfriend. I would be dissapointed, too, if I were you.|`|C021mpLLaa	Uhhhh..... Damn.

Don't be mad, but ask her why she would do something like that. you guys are 13, you have more fun and less disgusting things to be doing!|`|v2gyKb9Zaa	if you're mad because of jealousy, then that's wrong. but if you're mad because of disappointment in your friend, then no... that's not wrong at all. i'd be mad if my 13 year old friend gave someone a hand job also|`|9p70ijUgaa	Yeah, I'd feel the same way...  She's your friend, so tell her how you feel, not trying to sound like a counciller or anything, but try to get it across that its not right, kinda sick... really sick... why can't people just wait till marriage???|`|pIc6TiYIaa	I think its stupid to do that. Just make sure you dont lower yourself to her standands. Be careful, it might just be a rumor. Also remember you have the right to feel however your heart tells you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|pWCEwnvZaa	yuck<br>  <br>  that's so immature, pathetic.<br>  <br>  Oh you should be mad, in a different way.<br>  You should be mad because she's disgusting|`|vt8tazGdaa	um, no. it's wrong if you're not mad (very wrong). tell your friend that she's going down a bad road. if she keeps going this way, she'll end up being a prostitute or a paris hilton.|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	No, it's not wrong for you to be a little mad. I'd be disappointed too, cuz my best friend did wrong things too. A LOT of things..|`|3AAHmvKFaa	She's probably lying.<br>  Especially if she hasn't even kissed.|`|9aAO1J73aa	eeeewww unless u have a relationship w the guy it was her bad desision u should b mad but not 2 mad|`|UuSmemr7aa	You shouldn't becuase it's her probelm.|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	your friend is disgusting and a whore!! srry to say but its true. yes u should be mad.|`|sM9JQBG0aa	wth is a hand job?|`|EABPi1gsaa	No It's not wrong. <br>  Stop being friends with her, you don't need that kind of person in your life.|`|TgT6Agjbaa	i agree with MARY. ^^^^|`|eta0c25yaa	kids, they do the darnest things.|`|gy7m1D1Taa	you guys are only 13!! what is this world coming to. before you go any farther. take a walk to your local ARC or Planned Parenthood. theres to many stds out there for young kids to be coming sexual already. watch out.|`|G9831g5Baa	It's kinda wrong and slutatious but then again it's her decision.

Rmtfm7qnaa	It entirely depends on the school. There are boarding schools that range from hundreds of thousands a year to hardly anything by comparison. The area, financial level, and several other factors would influence the cost.<br>  If you know those factors, you could probably get a good answer in the education section of Yahoo Answers, so you could post a question to them. Good luck!

B8Gwxo1laa	This from TVGuide,<br>  "The seventh season wraps up tonight with a case that has special significance to Monk. He's investigating the disappearance of a city official who was lobbying to preserve a parking garage. But what's so personal about that?

The series is scheduled to return for its eighth and final season this summer".<br>  <br>  He really hasn't learned anything new in a while.|`|AeVnK1igaa	You're not going to be lost.

LkTcLWTOaa	sorry about your hubby....don't know the last episode you saw so don't know where to begin...<br>  <br>  cane, chloe, lily and billy<br>  <br>  billy and lily went up to the cabin to have some quiet time and chloe arrived. she went into labor and billy had to deliver the baby with lily out in the snow on the phone to olivia. cane arrived and they managed to get chloe and the baby to the hospital. she had some complications but now she's fine. while at the cabin lily found out that cane was not the father and in the hospital, chloe finally told cane but this was after he had already bonded with the baby. he refused to believe it and now he wants to divorce chloe and raise the baby with lily.<br>  <br>  sharon and nick slept together while they were snowed in at the cabin. nick returned home and decided that he wanted to make his marriage to phyllis work. phyllis found out about his tryst with sharon but she still wanted him (go figure). since she found out that nick wanted to stay with phyllis, sharon has been on a downward spiral. she got drunk in a bar and went home with a drunk billy and they spent the night together. she has also started stealing things. she stole a ceramic elephant from brad's memorial party(oh, will get to that in a minute lol). she also stole a paperweight from nick's office and just recently she stole something else (can't remember what) so don't know where this is going.<br>  <br>  noah and eden snuck out and went to an ice pond to go skating. noah was showing off for eden on the ice and fell in. eden went to get help. while she was gone, brad showed up and rescued noah but fell in and died. jack called him a 'bradcicle' at his memorial. just like jack!<br>  <br>  mrs. chancellor's dna test came back negative proving that she was not jill's mother. truth is that she is katherine chancellor but jill is not her daughter. the **** will hit the fan when jill finds this out. kay was kidnapped by clint (from an old episode) who thinks she is marge and is now being held captive by a crazy woman (from the old bob newhart show). she has to prove that she is katherine or they will kill her. clint is also working with roger. new guy on the scene who has swept poor esther off her feet. he wants to marry her to get the chancellor fortune and looks like he might do it too unless jill gets there in time to stop it.<br>  <br>  victor and jack...same ole same ole. <br>  victor is now involved with ashley and adam is still in prison. don't know why he has to pay for that whole scheme and jack doesn't.<br>  <br>  hope this helps...hope your hubby is out of the hospital soon.<br>  <br>  take care

BXq8MZ8Zaa	yeah, i listen to him every day. whats your question about him?
dM1jwSGyaa	Yes. I always apologize to inanimate objects. Like if I accidentally hit the wall or something, I'll be like, "OMG sorry!"|`|Fc9XExkIaa	Tacos and burritos are always giving me smack.  You bet I'll yell at them to SHUT UP.  Sometimes I get physical with them.|`|KnhC7FG8aa	i always yell at and get angry at inanimate things, like when the remote control doesntr work or something|`|jroabKEBaa	I yell at my alarm clock when it goes off early in the morning. <br>  That's normal for me.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Normal or not I do it.  Trouble is they never listen to me.|`|a80d8fcf832073af1867577d4177a832aa	No unless it really bothers you that much.|`|NmtuxgYcaa	I do lol|`|1NYipOpUaa	yeah i have before many times|`|AA10382483	Yes except when they respond, "okay!".|`|lm2ByrhHaa	yes, I yell at my camera. I yell at my cell phone. I yell at my cat...er...wait...yeah. <br>  <br>  But you know you've really lost it when they start yelling back...not that its ever happened to me...um...recently.|`|KLTktDV1aa	According to me, yes, to everyone else...it's a TOTALLY different story!|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Only if they are yelling at you:|`|ICTqyQaraa	well what did the toaster ever do to you?|`|xYLnLCVVaa	like a computer? yes.
1wNsBNmxaa	i have no respect for the guy any more<br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I didn't like him before, and I like him even less now.|`|5NsgLFPRaa	I never liked Chris Brown<br>  and now I just hate him even more<br>  he's an arrogant  prick from hell <br>  <br>  I didn't know Rihanna's injuries were that bad|`|0O3JvmE7aa	He "just had a moment"? Beating a woman is "having a moment"?<br>  <br>  He's a little b*tch.|`|gYyW39wTaa	i still love his music|`|R0Whhjo0aa	nope i kicked him out of my ipod when i saw Rihannas pictures|`|wvnZwO2Oaa	After hearing the story and seeing the pics, I have yet to listen to Chris Brown. And for you to make up excuses for Chris Brown means that you're think that domestic violence is OK, which CLEARLY under no circumstances is it ever ok|`|31TUT9lpaa	I think the sad thing about some women is the feeling that they can fix men. Thats why they date the bad boys. If you still like him after he beat Rihanna down the way he did then it futher explains my theory. That's like saying oh i just had my moment, i didn't mean to stab my mom. If you love someone you would never hurt them. My question to you is would you still love chris if he messed up your face the way he did Rihannas?|`|Pz8rIt26aa	You don't know what happened, none of us do.<br>  <br>  The herpes thing is a RUMOR....<br>  She may have hit him first....BUT since when does that give a man a right to beat the crap out a woman. He could have walked away.<br>  <br>  People who stand by CB through this are fools. How would you feel if it was your mother? sister? friend? If it was just a regular guy? Think about it.|`|tC85s3zHaa	I never liked him- and after beating a woman, I REALLY never will.<br>  <br>  " had a moment" ???? Beating a woman- celebrity or not- is not a small thing. IT IS WRONG.<br>  <br>  I hope his career goes down the drain along with his standards which he obviously let go.|`|iJXFZx7taa	Chris Brown is a major weenis and if you still support him then you are too.|`|ViPLHvqXaa	I have no respect for him. I will no longer support him.|`|OnzUAVdUaa	i still like his music. but i dont like him anymore. <br>  <br>  *i think i might take down his poster in my room*|`|fJFcIu5Yaa	No|`|uLHyDOm1aa	a moment?<br>  <br>  a moment of attacking one of the worlds biggest pop-stars<br>  well thats ok then...<br>  <br>  once a woman beater also a woman beater <br>  <br>  however his smile is gorgouse<br>  <br>  but still he is one of the most hated stars in the world right now<br>  im not a big fan of rihanna but i actually feel sorry for her<br>  the only desent song she ever sung was disturbia<br>  (but i did love her in my teenage days!)|`|7b67dbec640c7f28c229e51824c2d516aa	Really and truly I am still a fan of his MUSIC (i do still listen to it)<br>  <br>  but i don't agree with with what he did to Rihanna. He deserves what ever he has coming to him|`|BsK3u5p3aa	ur contradicting yourself girl! first u take up for Chris sayin he "juss had a moment. we all have them". then u say "y would i make up excuses for somebody that beats women".. but thatz ALL U DOING! lol n itz ur opinion, perogative, and ur right to like who u like.. but a woman beater is a woman beater. u aint no different than no other female. juss like he hit her, when worse comes to worse and u were chris's woman.. he'll beat u 2 cuz thatz juss "in him". n u juss said his parents were abusive or whatever so that makes it worse. ITZ PRACTICALLY EMBEDDED IN HIM! n his parents is no excuse either he has his own mind he make his own decisions. he kno right from wrong. he's a grown azz man. ok? dont ever take up for no man over a woman becuz no matter what, a man has no right to put his hands on a woman unless she threatening his life n he juss HAVE TO defend himself. even if rihanna was cheatin, so! she aint his puppet or his slave she dont owe him shyt. he aint KING TUT. he was juss tryin to be controlling. he betta sit down somewhere. IS THAT THE KINDA MAN U WANT? cuz he'll do the same to someone else's daughter. nobody perfect. im sure he did his dirt too... i did like chris brown. but now all i like about HIM is his music. until he really makes a change in life, he was wrong. n this pisses me off becuz i had to go thru somethin like this all my life so i kno A LOT about this domestic violence stuff. no one should put their hands on anyone (male or female). itz wrong n he should go to prison for that cuz he dont own nobody. he better chill out wit dat shyt.. some dude need to beat his azz fa dat mess. who he think he REALLY is.. fa real yo.|`|5nZwHs9Kaa	yes i am and i will be forever and the people that is not because he hit a girl is a ***** rihanna did something for that boy to hit her|`|6aEhPcDAaa	I still like his music and think he's cute, but after I saw the pictures of Rihanna on TMZ and Perezhilton, I don't like him as a person anymore.  He's a loser.<br>  <br>  -Erica.|`|1IZFvA45aa	i love his music <br>  but i think what he did was absolutely stupid & irresponsible<br>  & i think he deserves some major therapy.<br>  <br>  god bless rihanna.|`|ymjjUfuMaa	I used to not after wat happened he beat up Rihanna so badly now he's in jail omg i feel so sorry for Rihanna how could he do that he seems like a relly nice person!!!!!!!!!!|`|IDuA6JCxaa	No. I will not support him. I can only hope his reputation is ruined.|`|vvayZQzAaa	A man that hurts a woman is just a stupid assholee who should be sent to Hell.|`|fsE5LAhFaa	I don't like him but I like his music.|`|KnhC7FG8aa	i still like his music, but not him anymore
F0na6atkaa	tmz.com|`|OS8TRe0Uaa	watch the insider now their gonna show her face again|`|Uu0ROfuPaa	Tmz.com<br>  <br>  They have the picture under "the face of a battered woman"<br>  <br>  I would put the link but I'm on my sidekick sorry

iDuHMQnZaa	I don't know but I like them...
LsAArkUyaa	I would say in the order they were made, and possible watch the seasons of TNG and DS9 that aired at th same time. There are a few crossover story lines between those 2 series. <br>  While I see the logic behind watching Enterprise first, there are a few inside jokes in Enter prize that will be caught if you watch the other series first.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest watching the movies as they fall into the timeline also.|`|ba52jQHyaa	TOS<br>  TNG<br>  DS9<br>  VOY<br>  the development of Trek history and the ways some of the races develop will make more sense this way.<br>  <br>  then if you must watch ENT (I didn't like it much :-P) even though it is set before the other shows, it is a prequel that plays off TOS|`|a76ff3ee3234d42b9f9ea1fb54804198aa	i would say, the order they were made.<br>  <br>  there are other films and books which have prequels written afterwards but are set before the main bulk of the series.<br>  <br>  and i would read books in the order the were written, and watch films/tv shows in that order too|`|B8Gwxo1laa	The order in which they were made. The evolution of the franchise is more interesting than the timeline.

He makes traps for people, people who have murdered, raped, harmed people in some sort of way, etc. But the thing is, they can get out of the trap. He is not murdering them, he is giving them a chance for survival. He feels they must fight for their survival though, because they have caused others pain. His apprentice, is Amanda Young, a used-to-be drug addict whom he saved. She helps prepare the traps and what-not.<br>  Saw 3:<br>  I don't really know why you were confused for this one, but in Saw 3, saw trapped a man and was using his wife, who was a doctor to save him. She had a device on her neck, where if she didn't save him, and his heart stopped, it would be activated, destroying her face. In the end, the man made it through, but couldn't survive the test, the test of forgiveness. He couldn't forgive Saw, therefore, he killed him and his wife died.<br>  Saw 4:<br>  It all begins with Saw's autopsy. Before he died, he swallowed a tape recorder, telling that even though he was dead, his killings would continue. And they did.<br>  As for Saw 5, I feel they used it as an explaining process.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	i am up to watching no.4 and i don't understand either. I have kinda gotten bored of them actually.

dBj2zVOdaa	Do you mean George Spartels? It sort of looks like him, but I can't really be sure. Use the link below to look at a picture on George.
P8gGMlbIaa	It's fine, but needs more work. You need to learn to keep the lines neat and clean.You also need to check your proportions. The second character is facing forward, his shoulders should be a little wider.<br>  <br>  Try redoing them with these tips and see what the results are.<br>  First start them as a stick figure and fill in the body mass and muscle form. Then find body points to sort of hang the clothes off them, the shoulders, forearm and such.|`|Hiasgb75aa	4/10<br>  5/10<br>  <br>  Respectively|`|i210xqkgaa	i would rate them at 7.75/10. they're good, but they actually do appear to be a little scribbly. you just need to work on the hair a little and add some color and you'll be on your way to greatness. also, on the second one the irises are a little over sized and the nose is shadowed in a bit more than necessary. but just work these very minor issues.|`|aUadP7xzaa	Mmmm.... they're good. Maybe work on the eyes a bit, and better face proportions. You have the clothes down pretty well. But thy to give them a body underneath, so that the cloak could actually hang off of. Like a little broader shoulders. But it's definitely not the worst. They're decent for an amateur. Keep practicing ^.^|`|6tVY6RdRaa	1. i score 10<br>  2. i score 8|`|Kh3QVQYEaa	dang that's good<br>  first one is 7/10<br>  second one is 10/10|`|IX4mSxEMaa	Not the best but definitely not the worst either.  Just needs a whole lot more practice.<br>  <br>  I guess I'd also give it a 3/10 on both.  First one got a 3 because it really is too rough even though you can see which direction the picture will be heading if it's all polished up and stuff.  The second one is better yes, but I deducted a point for kanji mistake.  Seriously, if you cannot write kanji correctly, don't write kanji at all, definitely detracts from the whole picture effect when the picture itself is not as polished as it could be.|`|c9n8uUr0aa	i think the first one should get a rate of 3 and the second of 5 i both think they're really good i really like the second|`|0DDlABTraa	3/10 for both. Too scribbly, and your style is rubbish.|`|s01xJ5QXaa	i would rate it at  7 its pretty good i think!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cJV1LAFZaa	It's so amazing....<br>  how do you do that...<br>  I rate that 10....<br>  if it is 1-100.....<br>  I rate that 100......

tuATxHsVaa	Honestly how the heck are we supposed to tell you what you are doing wrong without hearing you?<br>  <br>  "I sound bad, tell me what I'm doing wrong"<br>  <br>  You're making it awfully difficult.<br>  <br>  Focus your airflow... play in-tune.. phrase better.. practice long tones... keep recording yourself. Use your diaphragm. Get a better instrument. How can we possibly know what to tell you?<br>  <br>  It's hard enough to HEAR what someone is doing wrong... and impossible to guess. <br>  <br>  You need a private teacher, not this forum.

No lie. It perfectly describes my life.<br>  <br>  Sample of lyrics:<br>  <br>  I will crawl<br>  There's things that aren't worth giving up, I know<br>  But I won't let this get me.<br>  I WILL FIGHT.<br>  You live the life you're given<br>  With the storms outside, some days all I do is watch the sky.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Well this song isn't really motivational but you can't deny that it'll make you dance.

Dvxr0C8Faa	I think they wear an earpiece so they stay on track/pitch/rhythm.. probably when she sings higher, they're stretching their mouths, which cause the earpiece to lose its stability within the ear.. thus making it more difficult to stay in tune...  just my guess|`|wZVBWX0qaa	I think it might have started as a way to hear the note better, to make sure they are on pitch/stay on pitch. I used to sing a lot, and it helps sometimes to cup your ear, or to gently pull it open with a finger or thumb (which is probably what Mariah and the rest of them are doing.)<br>  <br>  Some of those things develop into a part of the performance, though. To most of us peons it just looks like an impressive and mysterious "singer thing" we don't quite understand. It may make her feel more comfortable in that moment, the way some people moving their arms or "directing" themselves (think Christina Aguilera singing runs).|`|eNR2iot8aa	It's so they can hear themselves and make sure they are pitch.|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	iono maybe a habit...or composing themselves...lol....maybe have to do with hearing because they're pitch is to high....lol...

lZVz8SwBaa	This question appears regularly in the question file, so let's take a shot at it. <br>  <br>  In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. <br>  <br>  Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. <br>  <br>  Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	At least create more original questions...like what came first the duck or the duck egg.|`|0P5qBxiZaa	egg|`|VKXNWcbGaa	I say the chicken was first  because something had to make the egg, if you know what I mean. Plus, God says that He created the animals, so I think the chicken came first and then the egg.<br>  Plus, from the viewpoint of evolution the chicken came first because it evolved in to WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS A CHICKEN.|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	God put the chicken on earth|`|4vO41XV5aa	The Chicken|`|3m6wrCqraa	Chicken, I think, lol|`|AKVQNGcOaa	technically the egg b/c of dinos :D|`|Wm24YP6caa	I would say the chicken because it most likely evolved from some other creature until it laid the egg of the species of what we know to be considered the "chicken".|`|Nipbluclaa	Egg,<br>  I know it came first,<br>  I know everything.<br>  I even know your mums name :D|`|ul2zaaPNaa	The chicken came first because God put it there.|`|p6BLIraCaa	I say the egg came first<br>  Lol<br>  =)|`|tLS3oSfZaa	The egg.|`|o0vIaWx7aa	egg|`|DokumF0baa	It was the egg, because chickens were evolution-ed from the T-REX, so the T-REX's mate laid an egg, and out came a chick.

7acv3iEyaa	I don't know what you could do to start. What you are doing is good. You can post videos on youtube, just don't let the people see your face.  It does seem like the videos where people show there face get looked at more but i don't know.  Just don't show your face and your parents might not have a problem with it. <br>  Good luck|`|TJBEeXO2aa	You can post your singing on youtube w/o your face - I do that.<br>  <br>  I would say that being in a choir is quite beneficial, though the instructor always fails to impart every essential knowledge to his/her students, though it is not always their fault.<br>  <br>  There's always potential for you to sing. Like you said, the churches, perhaps theatres, musicals, in front of the school events...?

No theories, no evidence, and no way to tell even which type is the right one.Thousands of astrologers and no two will say the same thing.<br>  <br>  Since it is 100% belief oriented, you will have to choose to accept it or not.|`|caguAY0gaa	Cafe Astrology gives the best information I have found so far.

5dc42237ea103510238126df59d3a8daaa	The most popular blues is based on a twelve bar form just using just the one the four and the five. I'll spell it out even though it seems tedious. 1 measure of an E followed by 1 of A. Then 2 E then 2 A then 2 E again. Do a measure of B followed by a measure of A then end with 2 measures of E again and that's your twelve bars. This one song is the foundation for a whole genre. To solo. Just play in the standard pentatonic box shape with your first finger positioned on the twelth fret.

hs9Mibf5aa	Sad, I know.  Personally, I care about a missing person no matter what color they are, and wish things would change.<br>  <br>  A lot of times the parents are affluent or have 'connections' that can help them hire big lawyers with Search teams and PR guys to put them in front of the camera, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  But yes SHAME on EquusSearch!  I'd like to see them begin looking and explaining this also.<br>  <br>  CSI Miami touched on this briefly once when Horatio was looking for a rich white teen tennis player and she was being held by the same guy who had 'killed' a teenage hispanic girl prior to that.  The parents said, "How come you weren't beating our door down then"?  - I wish people would not equate $$$$ with human lives.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	i know, *nothing was ever updated about the 4 yr old florida boy who had the mind of a 2 yr old, who vanished from his fron yard.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	well it's not always<br>  i've seen children of other races <br>  i think its sad when they've been missing for like 10 years- its really pessimistic but i doubt they'll ever find them|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	It isn't just kids.  When Laci Peterson was missing, there was a pregnant black woman missing and there wasn't one word mentioned on national news about her.  It's all about what or who can bring in viewers.  As wrong as it is and as horrible as it sounds, some people think a well to do missing white person is more newsworthy.  Any missing person, no matter what race is just as important as any other.|`|Vl9jNPJNaa	Because you lived in a place where white people are so racist and annoying and other people just had to team up and kidnapped you all one by one... Just Kidding..<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, it has nothing to do with Reality Television~<br>  <br>  : )|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Because kidnappers are racist and only like white kids.  What kinda question is this?|`|Pa6cWyiFaa	Probably depends on where you live and what the area is like.  I live in the South in Charleston, SC and all the Amber Alerts that I've seen since we moved here have been for hispanic children.   I know what you are implying and I think that you are imagining things.|`|mYWeII5Zaa	because we have milky and delicous skin.

AA11505261	As to the birth of “In The Garden of Eden”, Ron Bushy lays claim to that: “I was supporting the band by making pizza,” he says. “I came home at three in the morning from working one night and Doug played me a song he was writing. He polished off a whole gallon of Red Mountain Wine as the evening wore on. He played this song on the keyboard and he was so drunk that it came out as ‘in-a-gadda-da-vida.’ I thought it was real catchy so I just wrote it down phonetically. The next morning we woke up, looked at the writing, ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,’ and decided to keep the title.” As the group became more comfortable with the song and its concept, it grew longer and longer in performance.<br>  <br>  “We were about eight minutes into it,” recalls Dorman, “Then we got an opportunity to go on the road with the Jefferson Airplane, and by that time, “Vida”, which we called it, was up to ten, eleven, twelve minutes and moving along. When the tour got to New York, it was time to record.<br>  <br>  “The song then took on a life of its own,” says Dorman. Although the album’s production was credited to Jim Hilton, it was veteran engineer Don Casale (The Rascals, Vanilla Fudge) who actually recorded the date. “I had a good half reel of tape left,” recalls Casale, “and Ingle said, ‘You’d better get another reel of tape.’ I said, ‘I’ve got plenty left.’ He said, ‘Trust me, you’re gonna need a new reel.’”<br>  <br>  Executives were wary of putting a 17-minute song on an album. They wanted pop songs. “We said, ‘What are you going to cut out?’” says Dorman. “There’s only about a minute and a half of lyrics, the rest is instrumental. No way. It was like a sonata, if you will. It’s an expression of the music.”<br>  <br>  Vida would never would have succeeded without the help of FM radio, whose free-form stoner “Ten records back-to-back for all you heads out there!” style had just taken off. The track became an “underground” sensation with the kinds of DJs and kids who thought they were smashing the system by listening to a song that was longer than three minutes. The album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida eventually stayed on the Billboard chart for 140 weeks, including 81 weeks in the Top 10. It became the first album certified as a Platinum Record for sales of more than a million copies. To date, it has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.<br>  -Sikorsky_Me on the official message board<br>  <br>  A commonly repeated story says that the song title was originally "In the Garden of Eden," but in the course of rehearsing and recording singer Doug Ingle slurred the words into the nonsense phrase of the title while under the influence of LSD. The truth (according to the liner notes on 'the best of' CD compilation) is that drummer Ron Bushy was listening to the track through headphones, and couldn't hear correctly; he simply distorted what Doug Ingle answered when Ron asked him for the title of the song.<br>  -Wikipedia|`|7fb5be0bf29e0c8d4f93f081af842fbeaa	First of all it's Inna Godda Davida.  <br>  I know Iron Butterfly did it....|`|AA10911722	In the Garden of Eden (and it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida")|`|AA11715392	IT'S INNA NOT ANNA!!!!!

i6eiBCXwaa	Joseph Simmons , his wife Justine ..<br>  Justine’s pregnancy was the cliffhanger on the MTV show last season. It generated intense interest among viewers who have been anxiously following the pregnancy and awaiting the birth.<br>  <br>  Simmons is married to Justine Simmons, mother of his children, Daniel (Diggy) and Russell (Russy). Justine is step-mother to Rev Run's three oldest, Vanessa, Angela, and Jojo.<br>  Justine Simmons is the second wife of former Run DMC member Joseph Simmons, also known as Reverend Run.<br>  <br>  Prophetess Justine Simmons joined Zoe Ministries in the early 1990's. She met and married Rev. Run and they have five beautiful children with one on the way. Prophetess Justine has witnessed first hand the prophetic word of the Lord with many many prophecies coming to pass. From the television show she and her husband star in weekly with their family on MTV, to her designer jewelry line that was first prophesied by the Master Prophet.<br>  <br>  Also, the word of the Lord came forth about her children's book. Her first book will be published by Harper Collins entitled, "God, can you hear me?" The book should be out January or February 2007.<br>  <br>  One of my husband's favorite affirmation from his book, "Words of Wisdom, Daily Affirmations of Faith, by Rev. Run" is: Enjoy the present! Are you waiting for that special occasion? If you're not happy right now, then it doesn't matter what's in your future --you could even win a free trip to Hawaii, yet once you get there you'll be waiting for the next high. The truth is, the only good time you will ever have is right now. Not when you get that new car and not when you get that new house. If you enjoy now, you'll have a much better time later!"<br>  <br>  The prophetic word spoken to me from the Prophets is life changing. You don't want to miss Prophecology August 2006 where the Master Prophet and the company of Prophets will speak life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it nelped you ..<br>  Good luck ..<br>  Have a great day ........<br>  .|`|22123c6c264734e7dee0ff7eeefe6d16aa	she is rev. runs second wife. they have 2 kids together and 3 frm a previous marriage. the have a show called run's house which aires monday @ 10pm on mtv...|`|611e8f14990603770fe198db6c5d5034aa	Can't find much on her, just about the loss of the baby and that she is the 2nd wife of Rev Run.

She is the stepmother to Simmons' other three children from his previous marriage, Vanessa Simmons, Angela Simmons, and Joseph "Jojo" Simmons, Jr. On September 26th, 2006, she gave birth to a baby girl. The baby was born, however, with her organs outside of her body and was later pronounced dead.

XjVWlAAWaa	No, Mika actually made them up for the song.<br>  <br>  The first part, for sure, was done by an actress hired by Mika. The last part, believe it or not, is said by Mika. It was probably changed to make it sound more like a girl but it is definitely Mika that says it. The middle part, I think is done by the actress, but it could also be done by Mika. It wasn't really clear in the interview about it. In the interview, he says something like, "She goes, 'Getting angry doesn't solve anything' and I wanted to put that in there." So I'm taking it as the actress is the one that is saying it. <br>  <br>  I was a little disappointed to hear that they weren't from Grace Kelly's films but it's funny that the last part is said by Mika. The interviewer didn't believe Mika, but Mika said he "swears to God" it's him and that he makes a "good girl."
AA10911722	I was pretty much self taught. There was no internet way back when, so you either took lessons, taught yourself, or both. I did take a couple lessons early, found it redundant (who doesn't when you're young), so I just bought a drum pad and started practicing.

When they're lined up, that means they're played ALL together. When there's a space, and there is just one number, it's a single note, then if there is no numbers, then that means that there is a break in the song.|`|D8TuTvZVaa	they separate the notes being played, like a rest note.

d48a760729dc12455dcdf5941bfea697aa	A middle-aged couple had two beautiful daughters but<br>  always talked about having a son. They decided to try<br>  one last time for the son they always wanted. The wife<br>  got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy. The<br>  joyful father rushed to the nursery to see his new<br>  son. He was horrified at the ugliest child he had ever<br>  seen. He told his wife, "There's no way I can be the<br>  father of this baby. Look at the two beautiful<br>  daughters I fathered! Have you been fooling around<br>  behind my back?" The wife smiled sweetly and replied,<br>  "Not this time!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BEFORE MARRIAGE:<br>  <br>  <br>  He: "Yes. At last.

Don't even think about it."<br>  <br>  She: "Do you love me?"<br>  <br>  He: "Of course!"<br>  <br>  She: "Have you ever cheated on me?"<br>  <br>  He: "NO! Why you even asking?"<br>  <br>  She: "Will you kiss me?"<br>  <br>  He:" Yes!"<br>  <br>  She:" Will you hit me?"<br>  <br>  He: "No way! I'm not that kind of person!"<br>  <br>  She: "Can I trust you?"<br>  <br>  <br>  For AFTER MARRIAGE.... read the lines from bottom to<br>  top.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   A drunk guy is walking down the street. He sees this nun, runs up and knocks her over. He says, "You don't feel so tough now, do you, Batman!?" <br>  <br>  <br>  A farmer just got married and was going home on his wagon pulled by a team of horses. When one of the hoses stumbled, he said, "That's once." <br>  Then it stumbled again. He said, "That's twice." <br>  <br>  Then later it stumbled a third time. This time, he didn't say anything, just pulled out a shotgun and shot the horse dead. <br>  <br>  His wife cried out and started to yell at him. The farmer turned to her and said, "That's once." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A thief stuck a pistol in a man's ribs and said, "Give me your money." <br>  The gentleman, shocked by the sudden attack, said "You cannot do this, I'm a United States Congressman!" <br>  <br>  The thief said, "In that case, give me my money!" <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A man died and went to straight down to hell. The devil greeted him and gave him a guided tour of the place. He told the man that there were three rooms he could chose from in which to spend eternity. <br>  <br>  The first room was full of flames so hot the man couldn't even breathe. He told the devil that there was no way he was choosing that room. So they moved on. <br>  <br>  The next room they came to was full of people who were being beaten and tortured. It looked so painful the man could not watch. He told the devil he definitely didn't want that room, and they moved on. <br>  <br>  The last room they came to had the president bush relaxing enjoying a bl*w job given to him by madonna, the man decided that he could handle that and told the devil that this room would be ok,<br>  "ok" the devil said "you can leave now madonna"<br>  <br>  <br>  there was 3 nuns talking and the 1st said <br>  " i found a dirty magazine in the fathers room"<br>  and the 2nd nun relpid<br>  '' what did you do with it?'' and the 1st nun said<br>  ''i trew it in the garbage''<br>  and the 2nd nun said <br>  '' well that is nothing i found a box of condoms'' the 1st nun asked<br>  '' oh my what did you so with that'' and the 2nd nun said<br>  ''i poked holes in all of them''<br>  and the 3rd nun fainted<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There was a blonde driving down the road one day. She glanced to her right and noticed another blonde sitting in a nearby field, rowing a boat with no water in sight. <br>  <br>  The blonde angrily pulled her car over and yelled at the rowing blonde, “What do you think you're doing? It's things like this that give us blondes a bad name. If I could swim, I'd come out there and kick your butt!”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A husband and wife had four boys. The odd part of it was that the older three had red hair, light skin, and were tall, while the youngest son had black hair, dark eyes, and was short. <br>  The father eventually took ill and was lying on his deathbed when he turned to his wife and said, "Honey, before I die, be totally honest with me - is our youngest son my child?" <br>  <br>  The wife replied, "I swear on everything that's holy that he is your son." <br>  <br>  With that the husband passed away. The wife then muttered, "Thank God he didn't ask about the other three." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There was magician on a cruise ship, and he was really good. <br>  He was performing the highlight of his show when a parrot walked onstage and squawked, ''It's in his sleeve!'' <br>  <br>  The magician chased the bird away. <br>  <br>  The next day the magician was performing his highlight again (in front of a smaller audience) when the parrot walked onstage and declared, ''It's in his pocket!'' <br>  <br>  The next day, as he was performing the highlight, he saw the parrot in the crowd. But before the parrot could ruin the magic trick, the boat crashed into a rock and sank. <br>  <br>  The magician was lucky enough to find a board to hang on to. On the other end of the board was the parrot. <br>  <br>  They stared at each other for three full days, neither of them saying anything, when suddenly the parrot said, ''I give up, what'd you do with the ship?''|`|AA12164601	Is my middle name<br>  Jennifer Randomness Smith lol|`|76de25695b8989efe111f3249728acbdaa	my purple lepricon shall appear under your bed tonight.<br>  Dont mind his rude jelly bean named paco.<br>  Damnit.|`|8aLwA4Z9aa	is over rated!|`|V7UN8g8Raa	Is very cool. <br>  <br>  Normal, predictable, and plain are way over-rated.

OKidf9VVaa	First of all relax, ideas are blocked out when you are too stressed. Why don't you start with a brainstorm session, just write down everything that comes to mind without judging. <br>  <br>  Even a boring story can be told in an interesting way, so even if you are born in Nothingville and attended Regular High and served burgers as a side job, you can make an interesting story out of it. Just pick an angle and keep it throughout your story. It can be an emotion, a key phrase, a way of moving - anything you can think of.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kind of audition you are doing but it's always a good idea to find out what the people you do audition for expect. Original ideas? Good looks? Fluency, intelligence, humor? Then focus on that. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that originality can be good, but too original for your target audience may loose you the job. So focus on your targets as well.<br>  <br>  If you really can't come up with a good format of your own, use one you really like and apply it to your own facts. Don't pick something your auditioners will know for sure (I mean, if you use Friends, Forest Gumb, Monty Python or so, you'll know everyone else knows that too).<br>  <br>  Oh, and make sure your tape and camera are of good quality. Nothing is more irritating than the umpteenth amateur sending in a clip made with a shaky cellphone.

Find a way to let her mother know what's going on.  I know it's scary, but her parents are the people who have to intervene.  If they are not active in their parenting and not noticing that she is coming home drunk etc... tell your mother or another adult you trust so that you can feel better about it. <br>  <br>  You could have your sister talk to your friend as well, or have her write a letter to your friend explaining her choices and how they affected her.

Examples; Not attractive enough, not making enough money, not living up to expectations in someone else's eyesight, disappointing their families, etc, AS her friend share with her something you fear about yourself. Give her reason to be concerned about you. This will allow her an avenue to open with her problem as an example to you giving you insight on why she drinks.|`|rupTJ00vaa	IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU ARE GETTING THRU TO HER BY TALKING TO HER.

DUH!|`|AA12004079	I don't think anyone truly wants Harry to die (unless they are not a fan or never read the books), but I think it is highly likely and would not be too surprised if he ends up dead. Not to say I wouldn't be slightly DEVASTATED, but I will be expecting the worst. For me, the worst came when Sirius, my favorite character, died in the 5th book. I really hope and do not think Harry will die, but it is a smart and somewhat predictable move for Rowling to go for. I think Neville and Voldemort will die, but no one will no for sure until we all get our hands on it on July 21.|`|LHYmGAaVaa	HARRY WONT DIE IN THE 7TH PART...<br>  <br>  IN THE FIRST 6 PARTS... JK ROWLING WROTE IN THE WAY THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO SHOW TRUE CARE FOR HARRY WAS KILLED... SO IN THE 7TH PART, THE UTMOST CARETAKER FOR HARRY WILL DIE... ROWLING NEEDS A GOOD TWIST IN THE STORY... SO, THE STORY WILL BE MADE SUCH THAT SNAPE WILL REVEAL HIS TRUE IDENTITY TO EVERYONE THAT HE IS THE TRUE GODFATHER OF HARRY... AND SO HE'LL DIE TO CONTINUE THE CARETAKERS' DEATHS...

I'm not absolutely certain when he sold his label and what, if any new artists he is putting out.  Secondly, I think it is okay for people to evolve.  We should become better versions of ourselves as we age, learning that we were wrong about some things when we were younger.  <br>  <br>  So...as you can see, I am not a Russell hater.

I work tirelessly for social, political and philanthropic causes that push hip-hop to new heights of power and relevance. Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation gives disadvantaged youth exposure and access to the arts.

You will never know any of these people and they could care less about you.  Music (if you can call it that) like this will never hold up to real music like metal, rock, blues, or motown.  These genres of music have songs being played 20, 30 years later and it still sounds fresh.  You will never hear songs from these clowns in about a year.|`|df56f351483d4ed6e6ba93e6963b1b82aa	Well now he can see what it is like to not be on top.  He made it his business to tarnish other people's careers if he had a beef with them or if he wanted to start a beef with them.  He did that to Ja-Rule and tried to start a beef with Fat Joe.  Now he is on the other side of the fence and I am sure it doesn't feel to good.<br>  <br>  50 Cent really needs to grow up.

Then again the movie is from the 1940's.<br>  <br>  That is all I can remember. :)|`|frCDJsLDaa	For one thanks for asking this question. The reason why this is a good point to bring up is because there are no main characters that are black. Yeah there are many people in the background that are black but none that are the main focus. No Queens, princess, knights, nothing from disney. Yes there are other companies that are producing black animate film for the child to have a cartoon to relate too. But nothing from Disney who is the major company of movies for children.<br>  <br>  Personally, when I was growing up I did notice there wasn't one Princess I could say "Hey mom she's like us." Nope! The closest I got was Belle because she had brown hair and eyes. Now that I am an adult I am looking at the children in my family and thinking where are the Black Princesses for them. They want to be a Princess, but do they have a disney princess role model?? I think not!<br>  <br>  And...That is all!|`|sPY3LRbSaa	Actually, I don't think so. Jasmine in Aladdin isn't black but she's the only character I can think of that isn't white in all their older movies. Which it too bad. You would think Disney would be more race oriented.|`|GAdH09Qkaa	They did in the movie "Song of the South" but black folks complained. It was a great movie with great music.|`|fda0a949fe27633df30f04adb24c3ffaaa	Another question would be, where are all the black ANIMATORS? Where are the black men and women who WANT cartoons with black characters? If it means so much to you, would you be willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of YOUR OWN MONEY to produce a cartoon with black characters? Instead of relying on a white person to do it?<br>  <br>  Back when Disney was the one in charge, he made cartoons about white characters for his white audiences. His white audinces in the 40s and 50s wouldn't go see a cartoon with a black main character. Simple economics.<br>  <br>  However, are you aware of a live action character known as "Uncle Remus", from Disney's "Song of the South"? Who, incidently, won an Oscar for his performance? I also think it could be reasonably argued that Mickey Mouse, the ICON of the Disney Conglomerate, is in fact, a BLACK cartoon character.<br>  <br>  The "Golden Age" of animated shorts (the 30s, 40s and 50s) had MANY peripheral "black" human characters, usually of the "Mamie Yoakum" variety, just as many 3 Stooges shorts (just live action cartoons) featured black characters whose main purpose was to pop open their eyes real wide and shout, "SPOOKS!" before fleeing.<br>  <br>  Stupid stereotypes? Of course. And due to increased sensitivity in the 60s and 70s, these types of cliches were no longer shown to kids on TV (by now Saturday Morning cartoons, were cheaper to produce overseas, just as the Simpsons is now). And Disney never DID Saturday morning cartoons.

7156f597d9c67b8d87a5f904455dcdf6aa	Well, the only one I knew was Gia Carangi. She was actually one of the sweetest people I've even known unless you made her mad in which case you had better run. She was a really sad person and lonely. The strangest thing about her was that she really had no clue how beautiful she was. If you saw her on the street most likely you would find her without makeup except a little lipstick.  In some ways being beautiful was almost a curse for her because alot of people never got past that far enough to see the truly beautiful soul she had. In fact she was indeed a very deep person and in a huge amount of pain that no one could fix. I still miss her and all these years later I still feel haunted by her pain!|`|b4a2ae90298c0b35884c9c9d04f1643faa	I remember when you asked this question like 2 weeks ago.All 3 are older than me,so I didn't get to meet any of them.

AA11421015	looks good.. first Bond movie actually based on a Flemming book. <br>  <br>  But i'm surprised that lady is gonna play M for it.

THese days though all they have to do is have its so that the general poopulation enjoys it without any background info on the movie. It should be parallel to MI:3 in terms of quality.

He thinks to himself, "This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!" So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over. <br>  <br>  Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies -- two in the front seat and three in the back - eyes wide and white as ghosts. <br>  <br>  The driver, obviously confused, says to him, "Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?" <br>  <br>  "Ma'am," the officer replies, "You weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers." <br>  <br>  "Slower than the speed limit?" she asked. No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!" the old woman says a bit proudly. The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that "22" was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. <br>  <br>  "But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time." the officer asks. <br>  <br>  "Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off Route 119."

If you live in the US, you can try going to your nearest Music and Arts Center store and asking them to check their national inventory.  They've been expanding a lot lately and have bought up some local music stores that sold or rented bassoons and since M.A.C. doesn't rent bassoons, those instruments are being sold at decent prices for used instruments.  That's where you're most likely to find a good instrument in playable condition for relatively cheap.  Failing that, I got mine on Ebay.  You could also ask at local schools and colleges and find out if they have any bassoons for loan, rent, or sale.

AA10911722	Maracas (sometimes called rumba shakers) are simple percussion instruments (idiophones), usually played in pairs, consisting of a dried gourd shell (cuia - 'kOO-ya') filled with seeds or dried beans. They may also be made of leather, wood, or plastic. Often one maraca is pitched high and the other low.<br>  <br>  The instrument is of prehistoric American origin. The word maraca is thought to have come from the Tupi language of Brazil, where it is pronounced 'ma-ra-KAH'.<br>  <br>  Maracas are heard in many forms of Latin American music and are also used in pop and classical music. They are considered characteristic of the music of Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. In rock and roll, they are probably most identified with Bo Diddley.<br>  <br>  Although a simple instrument, the method of playing the maracas is not obvious. The seeds must travel some distance before they hit the leather, wood, or plastic.|`|AA10224266	Maracas were created and first used by the native indians of Puerto Rico: the Tainos, as a percussion musical instrument. A pair of these are used to create the unique sound so common in Latin American and Puerto Rican music. <br>  <br>  Maracas are made from the fruit of the higuera tree so common throughout Puerto Rico. The fruit must be round and small. After taking out the pulp of the fruit through two holes that are bored through the dried shell, small pebbles are introduced into it. Then a handle is fitted to the dry fruit shell. Unequal amount of pebbles are used in a pair that make up the maracas, to produce their distinctive sound. <br>  <br>  In salsa music the maracas have become one of the most important percussion instruments because they add a driving pulse in the high frequency spectrum. Perhaps their importance to salsa is like the role of hihat and snare drum in pop and rock music. <br>  <br>  Maracas are now often made of new materials, such as plastic, but are used the in same way, fulfill the same musical role in Latin bands, and retain the same distinctive sound.
AA10911722	Sounds like "Dream Girl", by Serial Joe (the lyrics are close)<br>  <br>  Hey Girl, are you out there?<br>  I can see you in my mind. <br>  You've been messin' with my head<br>  Now I need to... unwind<br>  I saw you in my dream last night<br>  Now I want to sleep forever<br>  Girl you have got to see...<br>  That we belong together <br>  <br>  Where can I find you?<br>  I just gotta know<br>  This feelin' is amazing <br>  Don't want to let it go <br>  <br>  There you are again I see<br>  You walkin' down the street<br>  If I run around the corner<br>  You'll be there and we can meet<br>  I knew that when I found you mind would blow a fuse<br>  But no more sleepin' through my days<br>  Together we can't lose<br>  <br>  [CHORUS]<br>  <br>  Now that I've found you <br>  You've just gotta know <br>  This feelin' is amazing<br>  Won't ever let it go!

AA10911722	Children of Bodom is a metal band from Espoo, Finland. There is some contention regarding the band's genre classification, but in general the band's musical style can be described as a hybrid of power metal, melodic death metal and melodic black metal.<br>  <br>  The band's earlier releases leaned more towards a power metal style, but recently the band has focused on a style more closely related to melodic death metal. However, several key traits have remained consistent throughout the band's history, such as a focus on rapid tempos and technical guitar and keyboard solos. Other traits, such as Alexi's vocal approach and Jaska's use of blast beats are also consistent across the band's discography. The lyrics of Children of Bodom's songs are written in English and most often are concerned with the subjects of death, personal struggles, the grim reaper, war and the Lake Bodom murders.<br>  <br>  More info can be found here...<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Bodom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of...</a>|`|9f0f751cff5c8a76377c348244a5ff6eaa	Frikking awesome.<br>  That is all. =]]|`|817b3031ef4b6256d24513e0f06986daaa	They totally shred, in other words.

AA10911722	Air dusters have many chemical properties which make them attractive for air dusting. First, they are generally non-reactive with most substances, so they are safe to use with delicate electronics and just about anything else you want to spray down. Second, they are canned with a high degree of purity, meaning that there are very few substances like moisture mixed in to cause problems. Canned air is very dry and very clean, leaving no noticeable residue of any sort on your equipment.

Some of the scenes reflect things that have actually happened even if they are exaggerated.  Many of the metal bands thought it was so accurate that it wasn't funny.  I do see some of The Who and Led Zeppelin in there.  Jimmy Page used to play with a violin bow on dazed and confused, but Nigel from Spinal Tap actually rubs the violin itself against the strings and he tunes the violin like that would change the sound in some way! lol! that was so funny.

AA10911722	As with many psychedelic songs, its overall meaning is somewhat obscure. The lyrics consist of the male part describing a mysterious, powerful woman named Phaedra, who educated the speaker in the ways of love. The male part alternates with the female part, who identifies herself as Phaedra and speaks over ethereal, twinkling music about beautiful nature imagery — "flowers growing on a hill / dragonflies and daffodils" — and about the secrets held by an unknown collective "we."<br>  A possible explanation for the song is that the alternating male and female parts represent the differences between men and women, especially in regards to sex. The implication is that women know more of this subject and men must learn to respect women in order to understand this knowledge. However, another view posits that the male and female parts represent humanity and nature, respectively. The female parts are evocative of a supernatural setting, perhaps one one might associate with the nymphs of Greek mythology. This interpretation seems especially valid, as Phaedra is a character from Greek lore, who, upon being scored by her lover Hippolytus, commits suicide. Thus, the song may be imploring men to respect the women they love, lest they end up like the classical Phaedra.|`|AA10001291	According to Wikipedia:<br>  As with many psychedelic songs, its overall meaning is somewhat obscure. The lyrics consist of the male part describing a mysterious, powerful woman named Phaedra, who educated the speaker in the ways of love. The male part alternates with the female part, who identifies herself as Phaedra and speaks over ethereal, twinkling music about beautiful nature imagery — "flowers growing on a hill / dragonflies and daffodils" — and about the secrets held by an unknown collective "we."

ad7fcdf9a6d4c359ff86fb03e213e253aa	Ok, they put the ear on Budge, and while she was recovering she started talking to Liz about not being important.  Matt was going to give Liz his kidney, and when Sean found out, he decided that he'd step up and give her his.  Liz turned him down and had found a perfect 6 match that she needed for transplant, and whose was it??  That's right, Ms. Budge.  So that's going to turn out ok, God willing.  Then JR, (I can never remember his name, just his Dallas name) had the stroke, had the surgery, almost died on the table, but Christian shocks him and brings him back.  The end was Christian and JR's wife talking and Christian wants her to put him in a nursing home and she refuses to, and that was about it.  OH.....I almost forgot.  After Christian uses Kimber, she goes after Matt and starts seducing him....payback is a pain!!  Next week looks great, the midget nanny is back and looks like Sean is going to officially hit the end of his rope.  Hope this helped!!   God Bless!!|`|3839826a820c2501aa3fcc463460c189aa	Kimber have sex with cristian son.....and rosie odonel was the donor of the kidney...|`|749a615211bfd75b89c357c5e0437408aa	Matt told Liz he'd give her his kidney, but Sean didn't want him to do that.  He finally fessed up to Liz that he was a 5/6 match and would donate his kidney, but by that time (after some "I'm such a bad person and I don't want to be" bonding after surgery between Dawn and Liz) Liz had another donor.  Dawn donated her kidney to Liz.  Burt's surgery had a complication and he almost died on the table.  Christian and Michelle had a "moment" where they almost let him die because it would be easier for them but they didn't.  As a side note... did you hear about the spin-off they're going to do with Rosie's character Dawn Budge.  Supposedly a 1/2 hr comedy... interesting....|`|7ba049f642ff125573d23f4ac6165d9eaa	SORRY ABOUT YOUR LUCK!|`|97d270da2cf944f3b359b4d76e44c8c5aa	watch them replay it on friday at 11|`|AA10827761	Watch it again on Friday night around 9 or 10 p.m., same for Sunday night.

If she truly has a voice comparable to those artist and wants to earn a living singing, might I suggest you help her get to an American Idol audition.  The thing is, they only accept ages 16-24 last I knew, so she should audition soon if that's the direction she wants to go.  As you probably know, even finalists who don't make it very far often meet agents who take care of finding songwriters for the artist, etc.

3d87738e17384dc163f834819b4d8f82aa	they could be using a whole love thing with him for after all the fighting calms down and the hidden leaf village becomes safe. ya know just to make sure they always have to something to catch viewers attention. or they might even be saving it for next season hell who knows maybe instead of Sasuke loving Sakura we'll find out he loves Enu or if he turns out to be gay......uh that would be good but i doubt they'd do that. when it comes to anime they always seem to concentrate on girl on girl action when it comes to that. guess we'll just have to patiently wait and see.|`|3ec335203025272e428e98e62cd59f54aa	I love Sasuke, but Sakura is WAY too obsessed!!!|`|7b8563bb402b9f5ed351a0b00eb253f1aa	Huh?|`|AA12166382	he dosent love sakura because shes realllllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy annoying, she thinks she so pretty, is weak, is VERY clingy, and gets in sasuke's way when he dosent want her to touch him, **your even weaker than naruto** is what he even said to her!!* but even though i really hate sakura i have to admit she gets a bit stronger under tusanda. and sasuke "killed" naruto because he was his best friend even though they dont admit it, and the "ultimate" sharingan was only obtained by killing there best friend.|`|adcd0de5eec69fbe894e699148d3a435aa	because hes stuck up and a made up figment from the writers imagination because i think both he and naruto would like her cuz its called hormones unless hes gay <br>  basically the writer won't allow it|`|b3a81426d011a808f061c6fd18a1f707aa	Sucky Suske is either gay, or cant stand people who have pink hair, plus ever since she cut it she looks like a man.|`|bf06e9cdbf4f0886825503dacf3e0606aa	because he is a carrer - type priority.|`|zGg7LSjgaa	she is annoying!!!!!!|`|045b8872c9188a5776d1b2bf8036d110aa	Sorry, I dont think Sasuke loves Sakura at all.  Sakura is an obstacle and lack of ability compare to naruto, that's what Sasuke told Sakura. Sasuke said she's even worse than Naruto.  I dont think he cares for her at all because when Sakura confessed her love for him, he just says "thanks" and knocked her off that's because he doesnt want her to become an obstacle in his life. My opinion is, SAsuke treats Naruto more like close friend than sakura.|`|5db14b93b6f8b7df5274c10511ae863baa	no, i think he simply has more on his mind then messing around with girls. he needs to be the best for his revenge. and frankly, sakura may not be his type. your not required to like a person back. and to me she seems a bit clingy - and he doesn't seem to be a mushy, cuddles type.|`|AA12144282	I think it's that their personalities are totally opposite and sometimes it's just hard to get along with someone that is completely different from you. The incompatibles of their personality would be the most logical reason to why they don't love each other. <br>  <br>  Or Sasuke might be a psychopath- someone who doesn't feel guilt or antisocial personality disorder.  Sorry but just my opinion.|`|a259be7e9d14a98e81096525a2c1169aaa	Hey hi! I just thought I drop by and say good luck.
N4uvcAeaaa	It's an interesting symbol, but, like most tatoos, you will have to be committed to it for a lifetime. Do you accept the imagery?<br>  <br>  At once it is a crucifix, which can mean many things outside christianity, but nonetheless the source is evident. A snake wraps around the cross-- which indicates the presence of evil, of knowledge, which the alchemists cultivate-- and the inherent duality of man who sins by nature. Good and evil. Then there's a crown ontop indicating nobility, a kind of throwback to Plato's philosopher-king, he who seeks the truth as the ideal statesman.  But also the happenstance of royalty, the fortune involved in being gifted. And the wings-- the angelic. Through evil and fortune attainment of divinity, a form of luciferianism.<br>  <br>  Would you, despite the symbol, assent to the law of conservation? This fundamental exchange principle pervades the manga. But, as pervasive as it may seem, there are violations to be found in nature-- every blackhole inhales masses, not into a singularity-- by our evidence blackholes make masses completely disappear.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe you would more readily commit to the uchiha clan symbol? Though Sasuke has abandoned it, the mark is nevertheless present, as a source for his pride and value in his mission. <br>  <br>  Do you identify with the nobility of knowledge (at any cost) or protecting the honor of family (at any cost)?|`|970b4b1d4364b48874d8ecffb7009532aa	i think itd be good...|`|d9919f013aa248bb4a22f89e5d0e7bc5aa	Yeah I totally agree that it would LOOK cool, but honestly--in 10 years do you really want a symbol tattooed on your body from a CARTOON. A Japanese cartoon that has nothing to do with you.

9c37839cb850d3a78d07ab325af769caaa	He is an imagined character in the song.  Here is a quote from Dave Matthews:<br>  <br>  "I don't think that the song is particularly grim. I don't think it's a bleak song," Matthews insists. "I think it's somewhat more of a reflection, maybe a request not to forget things very quickly. It's about remembering, even if it's about imagined memories, like looking at someone's grave: 'That person might have been a slave,' 'That person could have been,' 'Her children could have been killed in World War II.'

WgTotvNEaa	Yes they died at the beginning of the movie in the car crash and then their souls were sent into a Limbo along with all of the other residents in Silent Hill. A Limbo is when you are not yet in hell but not in heaven either. Everyone in Silent Hill died in a fire that was caused by Satan and since Satan had a hand in their death, it wasn't fair that they be sent to hell immediately. So that's why Unalissa wanted them all dead so that Satan could have more souls in hell.|`|562c26255f07d7a25756420aac00d196aa	At the end of the movie it shows her husband comming home to an empty apartment and the mother and daught were in a "dream like" version of thier home thus implying that they died at silent hill|`|9aecee60158257477a0035b87d82175faa	The woman and the girl died in the car accident at the beginning of the movie and the rest is happening in the afterlife.|`|Prwaim38aa	It means this.

They rarely respond to emails and don't help you out at all. They are a scam. If you search yahoo answers there are many other complaints from many other people who have purchased from them.  They sell bootleg tv series that they record from tv broadcasts.  It is illlegal and they don't respond to you when you call or email.  Stay away from them and pass the word along to others who are thinking of buying from them.  They move sites every time they get caught.

Never throw out anything, no matter how bad you think it is turning out.  Somewhere down the line you can go back over those stinkers and find some good parts (music, melody, a riff, or some of the words.)  You can also get someone else later on to go over them and make them better.<br>  <br>  The way you have started out is the same as every songwriter does.  Just keep writing what you think sounds good to you, not someone else.

Tz4N1fpvaa	It would have to be Reed Richards in both the comic book and the movies. Reed Richards is who Sue Storm is actually in love with in both. The only reason they were ever apart is because Reed had issues with dealing with situations with other humans.  It is a flaw that he actually learns to overcome, which is one of the reasons that Sue actually ends up with him in both. <br>  <br>  Victor Von Doom, is to much a concieted jerk to end up with someone who is like Sue Storm. She isn't into the money or the power. Where Victor only wants Sue because he knows his money can't buy her in the first place. The only thing that Victor Von Doom loves, is power and what that power can do for him. <br>  <br>  Just like in everything, power consumes all to the point of self destruction. Power corrupts Von Doom, where Reed doesn't do what he loves for anything other then loving it. So Sue Storm ended up with the right person.|`|24720de85e2aaf3e0332815f63886b7baa	Movie wise Victor Van Doom.

Im more of a kick, jazz, and lyrical dancer.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, good luck sweetie<br>  <br>  you should go to discountdance.com it is a great source of good costumes at low prices for high schools.

KD52DfvBaa	Because after 10 years, it sucks.|`|WwbzgQElaa	I think after ten years of such an amazing TV show it was time to move onto something different. I mean alot of the acters and directers have spent 10 years working on this show (which is awesome) and I think for some it was about time they moved on. As gutted as I am that the program is finnishing, it being my faverite show and all, I geuss it had to finnish at some point. Plus i think it lost a little something when it lost Jack but it is still awesome. Also I think they want more people to get into Atlantis, which i might do but only cause Amanda Tapping is joining the cast for season 4 and she ROCKS.

I am a big elvis fan and when I saw that I was blown away.....<br>  <br>  And yes a movie would be great like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  More than 70-million people voted for their favorite American Idols. But it was the King of Rock and Roll who stole last night's show.<br>  Celine Dion performed a duet with Elvis and today, everyone wants to know how they did it.<br>  It's the duet that only the magic of television, computers and Elvis Presley Enterprises could make happen and it has a lot of people talking and asking 'how'd they do that?<br>  If you didn't see the show, Celine Dion appeared to walk out and stand next to Elvis as the two sang a duet of the classic "If I can Dream."<br>  The three minute performance showed the two together and also had single shots of each.<br>  There were also close ups of Elvis and his signature moves.<br>  <br>  So how'd they do it? In the old days Dion would have stood in-front of a green screen. A computer would replace the color green with video of Elvis.<br>  Last night, we're told Dion sang with a Las Vegas Elvis tribute artist whose body was shown in wide shots.<br>  That's what gave it the realistic look.<br>  At times, his face was replaced with the real Elvis taken from the 1968 Elvis Comeback special.<br>  They even used some full body shots from that special.<br>  Web chatter says Celine Dion sang the song five times and that it was all edited together to create the performance you saw.<br>  If you missed it, you can find it on You Tube     <br>  __._,_.___|`|8ac14be7559e04bd320a63ba150427f5aa	Fans can thank technology. Last week, Dion spent hours on the stage singing her part of the song several times without an audience or anyone next to her, looking to her side on cue.<br>  <br>  Then she did the routine again with a Presley body double who lip-synced Presley's song and matched his moves from his 1968 performance.<br>  <br>  Finally, all three elements -- Dion by herself, Dion with the body double and the original Presley performance -- were combined through editing and a technique called rotoscoping, which traced Presley from the original footage by cutting him out.<br>  <br>  "Rotoscoping allows you to take one image from a pre-existing piece of video and puts him a whole new environment -- completely new use of that same piece of video," Disney digital media designer Joe Husung said.<br>  <br>  Similar technology has been used before. It brought Natalie Cole and her late father, Nat King Cole, together to perform "Unforgettable," and allowed Forrest Gump to talk to former President Nixon.<br>  <br>  A new British show puts the technology to use every day in "Duet Impossible," in which stars perform with their late idols. If the concept crosses the pond, American audiences may soon see late legends like James Brown and Sinatra rocking the stage again. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3087711&GMA=true" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=30877...</a>|`|AA11002996	I dont no

YONsssglaa	thats very simple-- are you a guy or girl?  Either way.  Their are books out and articles on this subject.<br>  <br>  Heres a run down:<br>  At the beginning and end of the porn movies their are credits.. I suggest you start paying attention to the company names and not to the girls/guys in the video.  If you don't have movies then I suggest  you just go to Amazon or any adult website and start looking for the producing company's names.<br>  I'll give you a hint on one company:  Private doesn't make their own movies-- they only buy and resell.<br>  <br>  They will probably want a picture or two.  Basic details about your body, etc.  BTW:  you can freelance or sign contacts too.|`|f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	Hollywood as well as Ventura in California.

8gEMrNSBaa	Well i'm capricorn and i like aquarius girls.<br>  (and aquarius breasts of course)|`|REPgKZj8aa	A sure-footed Capricorn may be too conservative for Aquarius' eclectic tastes. Likewise, a Capricorn will probably think Aquarius is weird. If Aquarius manages to find an exceptional Capricorn - one who won't judge their tendency to throw away the past in order to embrace the future - Aquarius will actually be able to live life even closer to the edge than they do now. Neither Aquarius or Capricron are particularly emotional people, so they may have a hard time expressing affection and vulnerable feelings with each other. The good news is, Aquarius and Capricorn will always be able to maintain a great deal of respect for each other.|`|wiSry86Daa	They can make a fine pair. My brother is a Cap and his girl, Aquarius. They have broken up once but besides that, they've been going together about 5 years!|`|2ae940be22ef0bbab77b4ad5e7741c21aa	he has only lust for u since u mentioned that he looked at your boobs..but if u r fine with that we have nothing to say...basically, capricorns like girls who r modest....they tend to take them as girlfriends....toy girls r thrown away.|`|J88wE7fsaa	He is the sure-footed goat.  Aquarius is like the sky.  The goat would like to get as close to the sky as he can, but he might not step forward until he is very sure the rocks won't break loose underneath him.|`|e3839c5cd1134e5283c805d6999cceb5aa	i don't see why he wouldn't. other than what you've told me...<br>  aquarius is a good communicator, open minded, very persuasive, can win you over in an argument because he's able to make sense out of everything including skydiving naked. these are some things cappies lack..so for that he might admire you..|`|AbUi9TFGaa	Yes!!|`|TfmjU1Xqaa	When Capricorn and Aquarius join together in a love match, they tend to bring out the most positive attributes of one another. Capricorn is a more cautious, rational outlook on life, while Aquarius is insatiable, fostering an idealistic approach to nearly everything. On the surface, they may seem like total opposites, but once these two set eyes on one another, an unbreakable bond is formed.<br>   <br>  <br>  Both Capricorn and Aquarius can be opinionated to the point of seeming unwilling to compromise. Capricorn thrives on organization and is always looking for consequences. Aquarius is modern and finds routine troublesome and boring. Capricorn will find wonder in Aquarius, but may get frustrated trying to find a stitch of logic in their partner's desultory, mystical mind. Aquarius will not appreciate the domineering streak in their partner, but will find the solid base that Capricorn provides to be a great support and will be relieved that someone will help them to take care of their personal matters|`|b5677623e08caa6e076c1dd96eb8334faa	Yes, he does like you, but don't make yourself available to him all the time.  Guys tend to stick with good girls, yeah I know it sounds old fashioned, but that is what works.  I am speaking from experience here.
Wx2vXWabaa	Actually this film was based on a book that begged to differ from the normal point of view about the Bell Witch haunting. As per the ending, there was no spirit to begin with, and the whole thing was a parental abuse episode with psychosomatic resonances. (the whole thing is a mouthful - can't believe I just typed that!)|`|0g62r6LIaa	who cares. as a horror movie buff i have seen plenty of bad b rated junk. but this movie took the cake. and its not a B rated movie. it was mainsteam crap. I laughed my way through it. especially the three stooges slapping fit with the girl. what a joke. I also liked when the ghost was answering yes or no questions by throwing stuff and what not. ha ha ha. <br>  <br>  if you're upset about the false advertising... dont see primevil which talks about gustaf being the worst serial killer. but he killed less then half of what they said and, oh yeah he isnt a serial killer, he's an aligator! no joke.

dNPYSWRWaa	According to Wikipedia:<br>  "The contents of the metal case are never revealed (see MacGuffin). Mamet has written that he believes revealing such details can be anticlimactic, that a director is wiser to allow the audience's imagination to answer the question. This is a technique Mamet has used repeatedly in his films."<br>  <br>  A MacGuffin is something the protagonists are chasing in a film or story - often the "goodies" have it and the "baddies" want it, though in the case of Ronin, baddies already seem to have it (spies?) and terrorists (the real IRA?) want it, though Sam, the CIA agent (De Niro) manages to get it back. Whether he even knows what is in the case is a matter of conjecture.<br>  <br>  David Mamet (screenwriter for Ronin) has discussed the power of the MacGuffin :<br>  <br>      "the less specific the qualities of the MacGuffin are, the more interested the audience will be…A loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, but the whole point of the film is that the audience is not supposed to know what is in the case. <br>  <br>  I am sure there will soon be a film about why Litvinienko was poisoned....but we will never really know why.<br>  .|`|2450ec9e6d3869ead0de9bf051683455aa	idon't know but i got the idea that maybe it was a nuke? it cost alot.|`|5aeb0662039393d61ff7ef34baf79858aa	Same thing as the case in Pulp Fiction....<br>  <br>  <br>  They didn't actually say in either case what was in the case :)|`|ad0ed48e8fd6dda60793763dac232fc4aa	I think it was gold bullion- thats what it always is in these movies...

If it is on a sub-audio channel, and your TV supports alternate audio channels, you can go to the TV's menu and change to another audio track - you might end up with an English audio track, or you might end up with something else, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  This is the problem with downloading movies illegally.|`|LiEpVgzfaa	Hmm, if you downloaded it then you might be stuck with that version.  Being from a college where downloading movies was a way of life, there would be the rare ocassion where we would get either a crappy version or something similar to what you are referring to and there isn't much we could do just watching it in Windows Media or DivX Player.  I was thinking you were watching it on a DVD and in that case it would be a simple function if just going to the set-up options.

Personally, I never could understand how they could continue the story, since at the end of the first film, Connor McCleod, The Highlander, has killed all the other Immortals and received the prize.  Then, he's in the future, then he's just a few years after the first, then he's got a cousin that is also immortal and still alive.  Although, even though the plausibility of Endgame is off, I still liked that one.  If they made one without Connor, it might work.|`|AA11261749	I did know they were making a Highlander 5...news to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE!!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jaws_fan.tripod.com/id15.html" rel="nofollow">http://jaws_fan.tripod.com/id15.html</a><br>  <br>  Paul won't be in it...Lambert MIGHT be in it...|`|5I2iPYvQaa	"There can only be one!!"

ec81d730c461b40b63138ac09d89f100aa	Four half-steps is a lot.  Regardless of what you do, the strings will feel a bit loose and the intonation will be off.  I would suggest using the heaviest gauge strings you can find.  If you're asking about the actual tuning process, I would recommend a chromatic tuner. though you could use a keyboard for reference pitch.  As for guitar recommendations, I cant really help you because i don't know whether you're looking for an acoustic or electric guitar and because I'm not familiar with Fender.|`|AA11645742	tuning problems often are caused by improperly strung guitars. Are you guitar strings tuned by stretching the strings or loosening and tightening the amount of slack from the tuners. Fender guitars are going in a very non-friendly buyer market. If you go to shops you notice you can buy the cheap squier or the expensive fender strats. A used Mexi Strat is my advice with a new fender the HH or HHS are very nice. Good Luck!!!

NxgCV4piaa	You're right, musically, there is no difference between 4/4 and 4/8 if the quarter notes in the first equal the eighth notes in the second.  It is just a different way to notate.  I don't recall seeing 4/8 used, but I imagine someone might want to use it in a mixed-meter piece that goes from 3/8 or 6/8.  Other than that, it would just confuse people.|`|t4e7KPqxaa	In 4/4, you have four beats per bar. In 4/8, there are 4 beats per 8 total possible beats. Therefore, 4/8 has half the number of beats, either that, or the 4 beats are of half length. One or the other. <br>  <br>  The only advantage in using 4/8 would be for writing complicated music, Im guessing it would be more convenient to write in this measure when you have a lot of short, intermittent beats.
vRdGgzvSaa	Code Geass with "Hero" by Nickelback.  I like this idea because Zero is not an archetypal hero.  Other characters around him like Kallen, Suzaku, Euphie, and Nunnaly end up having to fight their own battles without his help because of his selfishness.  And the last bar of the song would go well with Lelouch's change that starts at the end of the season where he begins to show some feelings toward C.C.<br>  <br>  Monster with "Cherry Lips" by Garbage.  It would be hilarious to have this playing while showing Johan cross-dressing.<br>  <br>  Blood+ with "Time After Time" because of Hagi's and Saya's timeless love and because everytime she falls, he catches her.|`|kBk9jXVwaa	Naruto<br>  First Love by utada hikaru<br>  i so like this song it makes me cry always. since the song is about a broken hearted girl because the boy she loves leaves her but she still loves him you can pair up sakura and sasuke, read the lyrics so you'll understand: <a href="http://www.animelyrics.com/jpop/utada/utadafl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animelyrics.com/jpop/utada/ut...</a><br>  <br>  the first could be the part where sasuke leaves sakura or before that get a fan art that shows them kissing then put the scene i mention first, you can aslo put naruto if you want just read the lyrics and you'll get lots of ideas, i have a lot but i can explain it well, i'll jiust email youif i can.<br>  <br>  you can download the music at limewire or here <a href="http://www.mp3-download-lyrics.com/music/Utada-Hikaru/First-Love_230198.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3-download-lyrics.com/music...</a>

The basic belief of astrology is that planets and stars exert an influence upon our lives. Those with special knowledge—astrologers—can predict events in a person’s life. It is distressing that most major newspapers have a horoscope column, and even more distressing that many Christians read their horoscopes.<br>  <br>  The Bible expressly forbids divination, sorcery, and hidden arts (Deuteronomy 18:10-14). God’s people are to heed God only (Deuteronomy 18:15). Any other source of guidance, information, or revelation is to be rejected outright. See also Acts 16:16-18. The Bible points to Jesus Christ as the only proper focus of faith (Acts 4:12; Hebrews 12:2). Our trust is in God alone, and we know that He will direct our paths (Proverbs 3:5-6). Faith in anything besides God is misplaced.<br>  <br>  Astrology, then, opposes biblical teaching in at least two ways: it advocates faith in something besides God, and it is a form of divination. We cannot determine God's will for our lives through horoscopes. As Christians, we are to read the Bible and pray to God in order to gain wisdom and guidance. A Christian consulting a horoscope is a violation of God's means of communicating with His children. I strongly believe that horoscopes should be rejected by Christians.

And my dad made me get indestructible glasses in the 7th grade that were so ugly.  Just plain black square frame glasses. Uggghh!  You could twist and bend them all you wanted and they wouldn't break.  (Believe me... I tried so hard!!!).  I also remember a pair of shoes I hated, that I did my best to wear out as fast as possible, by using my shoes for breaks on my bike, instead of the bike brakes, lol, and walking through mud puddles, etc...

AA10858028	Yes, I do put on lotion every time I wash my hands. I am an african black person, so our skin dries very easily. Soap strips our skin of all of the oils that were keeping them moisturized.

So a good looking person with low self esteem might be with a not so good looking person and not realize they could do better. This is the rule but there are of course exceptions. You have to also take into account different tastes and personalities. I used to know a girl who was so pretty and she knew it. She would only date gross looking guys because she liked the idea that people wouldn't think she was shallow.

Then it can just happen when it is meant to.<br>  <br>  But for fun, why not, initiate by being genuine, true to yourself, honest... have some dignity!<br>  Can i tell a story, will anyone read it?<br>  <br>  I was looking at some land to buy around here, it was a nice 20 acre bush-block. I spoke to the agency, who agreed to send out a rep to meet me at the property. I arrived early, had a quick look, and was interested to see more. The A/R turned up, got out of her car, our eyes met, and, you know... the Hubble telescope has nothing on what i saw in those eyes of hers...<br>  <br>  So we looked over the land, walking and talking, for about an hour or so, it was all good, we chatted about terms, etc. As we were leaving i asked for a contact ph number, she gave me a business card with her private number on the back.<br>  <br>  I called her the next day, we talked about the land, and she mentioned she had dropped a brooch while we explored it, she was sad cos' her G'mother gave it to her, and feared she wouldnt see it again, the property was pretty wild. (and we had gone over most of it)<br>  I said i was good at finding lost things, and if it was ok, i would go back and have a look for it, i could look at the land too, so i didnt mind. <br>  <br>  I went out and followed the pathless route we took through the scrub, and after some time had reached a low cliff where we had stopped the day before. As i turned to go back, i noticed the edge of something in the leaves and rubbish, almost invisible, her Grandmothers old silver brooch! It was quite incredible, it was old dark silver, black, and nearly invisible in the litter, it could have laid there for millennia untold, buried by the dust and detritus of time.<br>  <br>  I phoned her later, said i had found her heirloom, and she suggested i come around for dinner, i could give it to her then. We had a lovely dinner, her 15 yo son joining us, then going off to do his own thing. We had a nice evening, talked about everything, i massaged her feet, she lived on those wonderful feet, then later she took me to bed around 10.00 pm.<br>  When she undressed i was stunned, she was the most beautiful creature i had ever seen, and a natural redhead.<br>  <br>  She stood there in the muted light from a lamp, magnificent, a mythical beast, she said "make love to me all night", which we did, exploring passion long lost to both of us, finally sleeping sometime after 4 am. For me, i had been washed upon a paradisiacal shore, shipwrecked long ago, adrift for years, all my energy spent hauling myself up her copper sand beach, i fell into a deep sleep...<br>  <br>  During our passion she said "you are mine now, forever". I accepted, already her willing servant, i would've done anything she asked, no matter the sacrifice, in fact, such was already the case..., but that is another story. Indeed, i would have run off and found a celebrant on the spot, but where at 3.30 am in a sleepy country town?<br>  <br>  Next morning we showered together, i was humbled by her beauty, indeed the beholder was pleased; her voice was velvet woven by sting-less bees; sweet, classy, and restorative to a heart too many times broken, royal jelly.<br>  <br>  When i left her, all seemed fine for a new future, a reprieve from the tyranny of my past, a new beginning, with a goddess. I am an atheist, (a heretic!), but i wondered if there really was a god, a destiny, a guiding, guardian angel?<br>  <br>  To cut a long story shorter, we talked again the day or so after, (never bug a woman you have just met, take your time, go with the flow, see what she wants... ) She said it was over, a mistake, she was sorry, but that was it. She left the area sometime later that month, vanished, nobody knows where... I dont think i will ever recover, too old now, too sad, in fact, when she told me we wouldnt see each other again, i thought about getting a gun... <br>  <br>  But, life goes on, and yet it was the death of my youth, of hope, of a dream too, rather, it was fantasy, a wicked dream, a heavenly mist which intoxicated me and made me dream of a future with love and friendship, beauty and wonder. <br>  <br>  Sure, we do recover from these things, but dare i say, the way we were brought together, the timing, other details i cannot say, all would make you think this was an event so extraordinary, sure, a one night stand, but also a keyhole to a future i thought restored.  In fact, and unfortunately, only the door to an antechamber, and beyond that, her heart remained locked, inaccessible. It became a satanic emotional tomb for an excised portion of my heart.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	after the date, you say " would you like to come back to my place for some naked twister?"|`|NF1w4l04aa	I usually just hogtie myself to their bumper then yell "surprise!" when they get home.  <br>  <br>  Once they pass out they're better to deal with in the sack|`|yGm29f3Eaa	Wanna see my collection of pokemon and GI Joes?|`|EiB6GNxlaa	well either she is really hot... or I am really drunk... either way works|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	You:  "Hey, you're hot, wanna do me?"<br>  <br>  Him:  "Hell yes."<br>  <br>  You:  "Great.

2LpWgU20aa	i cant stand it when they answer even though they dont know what they are talking about so they are like "idk, whatever but thanks for the two points!" or if they dont say anything and just leave a link to their question. i dont mind it if they give a thorogh answer that they did the best they could and leave a link but as long as they try. if they dont know the answer they shouldnt bother even answering. i dont know what the point of edit though, i find it unnessasary.|`|r8ST3cFIaa	No offense but do you know the meaning of edit?<br>  That's not their official answer.

Jx5BLTvoaa	If you wanna know if your any good DON'T record yourself with a tape recorder it doesn't actually come out like your real voice. I know this coz I had this problem a few years ago. Either ask your parents because they are supportive. Then again maybe don't ask them coz even if someone SUCKS if they're a kid of their they always support them. Something you could try is getting a video camera and recording with that. That is the only thing I can think of that gives you exactly what you sound like. Also some excersise you could try. hmmmm. Breathing in and going ahh for as long as you can is a really good one. Also you know how you can press you lips together and make an engine sound. Doing that and going up in a scale is good too.|`|HDvsMKEaaa	Hello Rock star,<br>  I being a music programmer and music director wanna suggest you something what I experienced. <br>   Don't think that singer when sings live without instruments he/she is unbeatable or best. Always singer's voice are modified to some extent while recording and after recording also.<br>  If u record ur voice over something and try to match ur voice it will be never. Because singer's voice is modified with compressors, echo and reverbs atleast. <br>  If u donno what are compressors, echo, reverbs and how to apply them just do one thing. You just sing a song. record it to mp3 file on a pc. Send to my email Id so that I will process ur voice with above things and send back u the wet file along with my analysis and suggestions. Then u may decide whether u r good or not. I think definitely u will love ur voice after these process and wish the same too.<br>  my email Id is<br>  manjunath.khot@yahoo.co.in|`|zkqUObyJaa	Who cares if your good or not just sing couse you like/love to. No ones going to tell you your a bad singer. If they do that just means they WISH no dream they could have a voice like you<br>  <br>  But if you really want the truth ask a really close friend she/he'll know how to tell you if your good or bad but they'll say it in a way that wont hurt if its bad <br>  <br>  sing your heart out girl!!! : )|`|kQRdgplZaa	aimizzle, people who know they can create that habit!!! I'm one of those people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  Anyway, rockstar, u should sing for ur friends and see what they think. Don't do it to ur parents. They won't tell u what they really think. Hope that helps!!!!|`|hS6h2IMOaa	Try Canta. It is a software used to learn to sing in tune. It will show you if you are in tune, and if not how to fix your voice.|`|9BXNkw6Laa	Go sing karaoke.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any friends to go with you for support, you can find a meetup group in your area.|`|7RoJwIiLaa	Record yourself then listen.

2qW1Q9fZaa	I'm not really sure about the exact age but I want to get married before the age of 25 lol...|`|TdA6CjVBaa	I would say somewhere in the 20's. It depends a lot of the person's situation, like, if they are going to college, or if they have a steady job, etc. <br>  <br>  That's not true. You are worthy of someone's love. Most people are a lot harsher on themselves than they have to be. You will find that someone sometime I'm sure.|`|MeGazyy7aa	Well, my Mother got married at 19 and has been with my Dad for 25 years in March. But, I'd say, like, 23?<br>  <br>  I'm like you, I'm not going to get married, it will never happen, I know that for sure.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do that to someone. That would be cruel to them.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	27 for me but that when I met the love of my life. So you cant really say what age is right to get married at. the age is when it is right for you!|`|P8uh4joQaa	23, that's how old I am now, I'll be married in about a month.<br>  <br>  <br>  not true, you just haven't found a special person yet, everyone has someone.|`|toLCaFc9aa	That is a hard question. I guess it depends on the situation. I married at 16 and I am still married today (5 years) and I love him like the first day or more, so that depends.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	30, because you have had a chance to see the world and complete college........|`|XDfrSfrvaa	WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, AND WANT TO=THERE'S NO SET AGE LIMIT|`|6BcQ438zaa	There is no set age<br>  It's different depending on each person/couple<br>  whether it is 16 or 45<br>  I got married at 21 & that was the rt time for me<br>  but for my husband it was 28<br>  it was the time that we were both personally done partying, ready to settle down, in love etc.<br>  you don't pick an age, you just know when it's right & when it's time<br>  You are worthy of love,<br>  you will find someone that will change your mind about that : )<br>  everyone has someone out there for them<br>  eveything happens for a reason <br>  & what is meant to be will always find a way|`|vHvhC9eZaa	Not married yet, but I will be soon. It all depends on your financial, edification, residential status and social life. However, the appropriate age would be 21-26 years of old. I would like to be youthful and energetic for my kids and grand kids. Also, to not be in my 50s or 60s once my kids hit certain aspects of their life (high school, college, starting a family and etc..)|`|AA11609300	I got married at 21, but we were together for 6 years before we got married.<br>  I think it really depends on your comfort level with the person and your financial situation (it's expensive to get married).<br>  <br>  <br>  And, I think you will get married someday.  We're all worthy of love.|`|Oejricveaa	I think when the couple is stable and mature then they can get married, so I guess ages 18-100.<br>  <br>  I got married 2 weeks after I turned 21 and my husband was almost 19.<br>  We have been married for 1 year and 5 months. <br>  We are very happy together!<br>  <br>  Everyone is worthy of love!!|`|M03NxWlPaa	The age I would preferably get married would be early 20's like 21-22, but thats just me, Of course I'm not there yet, so, Who knows!!!  I would pick that age becasue its not to early and not to old...If that makes any sence at all...<br>  <br>  Dont worry, You just havent found your significant other yet...You'll find them!!!|`|d5duruQaaa	not sure i will, i think it's my thing although not right now<br>  <br>  28 or 29 + because i don't know, for me i feel that's the right age, not too young and not too old<br>  <br>  well, many say they don't want to marry but who knows..?|`|z9hRuFDiaa	It really depends on how mature the person is, I've known people who got married at 17 and were happily married until their 60th wedding anniversary, on the other hand, some people are never ready for marriage.<br>  <br>  I got married at 22.|`|BTSpNeuWaa	I don't think anyone should get married until they have lived their life single.  I was married at 20 to my 18 year old husband and at the time we thought we were so mature and hindsight showed me we weren't. I think mid 20's to even early 30's would be more appropriate.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	No younger than 35.<br>  <br>  I am 44 never married.  The older I get the older I think people should be when they get married.  LOL!!!|`|kc1IBYMRaa	The older the better.  Preferably posthumously!|`|QLXjVkaDaa	First off, that's weird and 2nd any where from 22-30 i think is good, unless you get divorced then whenever|`|l3Iu43Wpaa	20 to 30|`|7xkwE3X9aa	I think 23- 30. <br>  I don't know if I'll get married, I hope too though.|`|3yKWT4WRaa	25|`|js2TUHFdaa	27-28|`|UTgz8yNnaa	26 YOU NEED TIME TO BE YOUNG LOOK  AROUND AND PARRR-TAYY!!!!!!!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Mid to late 20's. Me - 28|`|YkseyT7zaa	When they are mature enough.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	A good age to get married is when you're 100% ready. That could be at age 18, it could be at age 70. It's an individual thing. <br>  <br>  I'm engaged to be married about 16 months from now. On my wedding day I'll be 27 years old.|`|ZKFhlHhKaa	CORN! STOP IT NOW!!!!!! YOU WILL GET MARRIED YOU'LL SEE! IT WOULD NOT BE CRUEL TO THEM IT WOULD BE A GIFT BECAUSE YOU ARE THE NICEST PERSON EVER!!!!!<br>  <br>  Anyways I think from the ages of 18-100.

mGfCY4Ytaa	blech. neither!!! here are the facts:<br>  <br>  1) All of Pizza Hut's dough (even the "hand tossed" kind) is shipped in already tossed out.<br>  <br>  2) While Domino's does toss out their own dough, it's still shipped in- they send these big trays with globs of portioned dough on it. <br>  <br>  3)also, we've used ingredients that are not fresh enough for me to eat. once its cooked, you can't tell how fresh it was. im talking soggy onions and dark mushrooms here. my co-worker that used to work at Pizza Hut told me that their ingridients are like that too.<br>  <br>  It's got to be an independent pizza chain for me to be happy. Here we have Mellow Mushroom and Capone's.

Zm6wN4pRaa	I've already seen the movie thrice! Friday with friends, watched again on Saturday with cousins and again on Sunday with parents! Do I need to say more? I'm a very big fan of SRK, Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, Karan Johar and Rajshri Productions (Sooraj Barjatya).<br>  <br>  I loved every single minute of the movie! Its a very simple, innocent, funny family movie. Though I still feel that not everybody would like such a movie. But please don't go with the comments that some critics have written about this movie. Its far better than those rude-rough comments. I've seen it thrice and can watch it many more times without getting bored!|`|E870WbAsaa	Depends   :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine     → →  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081216050844AAs6zBr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  → →<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApWCdkf1IpE2o57nB1GCq1gazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20081216040114AAsQfsE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IB36yrr6aa	It depends upon person to person....Its a new generation film and like it because of that.|`|IgMpMyzraa	it is a nice movie u should watch it 2or 3 times|`|AA10902994	It's really a very cute movie!

I read it's supposed to be about an extraordinary love story.<br>  <br>  From what I saw, it looks like an amazing movie!<br>  <br>  I'd definitely see it if it's released here with subtitles.<br>  <br>  May I ask why you think the movie is not nice to watch?|`|wz8gx3gaaa	If you love SRK insane and without logic romantic movies, probably you will enjoy it.  But this film has cross the limit of illogic and story is so lunatic that a wife cannot recognize her husband when he shed his moustache and wear flashy clothes.  It can only be happened in foolish paradise of Adi Chopra and SRK.

IugZ4zwTaa	I am a huge Tool fan, the previous answers are right, there isn't too much similar to Tool. There is always A Perfect Circle, another Maynard band. Justin Chancellor's old band, Peach, is in the same general genre of Tool. The Deftones can be similar, but its usually a hit or miss. For some reason, The Mars Volta has a similar appeal even though they are quite different. The Mars Volta's singer does not appeal to everyone, kind of an acquired appeal. There is a band that used to be called The Apex Theory, now called Mt. Helium. They are kind of similar, but since they became Mt. Helium they either changed a singer or he just started to sound more poppy.<br>  <br>  Favorite songs: <br>  Pushit<br>  Forty Six & 2<br>  The Patient <br>  The Grudge<br>  Opiate<br>  Sweat<br>  Sober<br>  Wings for Marie<br>  10,000 days|`|9e62b407004d2d84541386c9c9d6b4d8aa	Best songs: Vicarious, Schism, The Pot, Parabola & Jambi<br>  <br>  Similar Artists: A Perfect Circle, Puscifer, Deftones, Riverside, Porcupine Tree, Rishloo, Fair to Midland|`|zfadjiJVaa	Stinkfist<br>  Pushit<br>  The Pot<br>  Lateralus<br>  Schism<br>  Vicarious<br>  Prison Sex<br>  Sober<br>  <br>  There's not many bands that are the same as Tool its where hard to have that same sound.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	ISIS is very similar- I actually like them far more than Tool.|`|c8IleGtOaa	i dont know their best songs, im not into them<br>  but everyone tells me that the australian band COG are very similar|`|12QJ9QMRaa	the Pot.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxEHLPhGriQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxEHLPhGr...</a><br>  <br>  One of Justin Chancellors best basslines, period.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	Tool's best songs are off of the Undertow and Aenema albums...there is no other band like Tool, believe me i tried looking, i typed in Tool on my Pandora account (which is pretty good at matching bands) and they played Korn, Disturbed, etc..those bands are nothing like Tool, just 'cause you play hard-ish rock doesnt make you like tool

There's also Graboid if you want it for free, but you only get a little bandwidth to use and then it expires, making you pay. But if you want to check out a couple episodes without shelling out... I think you can buy the DVD from either HBO or the official website, if there is one.

kJ7mcPLbaa	I have and it was the scariest thing I have ever experienced! I had to go to the ER and have CTC's and EEG's done. I am still on medication and will be until 3 years after my seizure. At that time, they will re-evaluate me and see if I still need the meds. I bit through my tongue and took forever to get back to my old self. It was difficult to remember things and form thoughts properly. It wore off after a few weeks. I was sleeping when it happened. My boyfriend at the time called the paramedics and woke me up, told me to get dressed (he explained to me what had happened), and then they took me to the ER in the ambulance.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	no|`|M3H4NtrAaa	I had one a few months ago.

PCNsRfJPaa	We were married on April 3rd.  Upon moving to Vegas, we started a tradition of putting $10 down on #3 at the roulette wheel every year on our anniversary.  We only lived there five years, never won.<br>  <br>  This past August, we found ourselves in Vegas for one of our daughter's weddings (8/8/08).  The night we arrived, we played slots for a couple hours, breaking even.  Heading back to the room, we passed a roulette table.  It was crowded and the ball was spinning.  I nudge in and throw $10 on the table announcing, 'money plays, #3.'  The dealer kindly says, "Sir, this is a $15 dollar minimum table."  I quickly toss out another five.  He puts it all on #3.  And....BAM, the ball stops in #3.  The table went wild.  We won $540.  It was pretty cool.  Aside from seeing our daughter getting married to a great guy, the $540 made the trip!!<br>  <br>  We're not going to retire on $540, but it was very exciting.|`|0APjNSc5aa	No.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I have not had substantial wins on the lottery, usually I manage to get three numbers and win ￡10, I have had a few of them.

Simplemente piensa: QUE LA NATURALEZA NOS HA DADO LA VIDA, LA VIDA NOS HA DADO EL CONOCIMIENTO, EL CONOCIMIENTO NOS HA DADO EL PENSAMIENTO Y EL PENSAMIENTO NOS HA DADO LA ENERGIA.

Después salgo corriendo a buscar el teléfono para denunciar un crimen en contra de el maquillaje!

En ese momento mi hermana vendría corriendo a mi cuarto gritando que si ella lo hubiera dejado entrar lo tendría en su cuarto para que le ense?e como maquillarse así.  Mi hermana lo agarra a MM y le dice que el ídolo que es y que la espere a que se vista para ir a presumirlo al café que siempre vamos.  Para ese momento mi mamá y mi papá ya se hubieran levantado y la mirarían a ella como yo la miro, con una cara de rara....Mi hermana le pediría a MM que le cante un concierto privado, ya que no puedo ir a su concierto que tuvo la semana pasada el 14 de febrero acá en Salt Lake City porque en justo era el casamiento de un amigo.<br>  Que tal, muy original, no? :-)<br>  Lo del projecto de asistencia al concierto fallido por el casamiento es todo verdad!<br>  Ya se que se suponía que estaba sola en mi casa, pero a mi mamá no le gusta dejarme sola en casa...|`|d60304a43b9e3e4ff4d1a1f9559218d2aa	Saco el matabichos y lo corro con el, aunque estas especies rastreras son difíciles de matar|`|tuJYhVXaaa	Preguntarle que carajo a comido para tener la boca tan sucia.

RK6hXEJcaa	They are trying to be all inclusive, covering Christmas, Hanukkah and New Years in one phrase.  Personally, I rather be greeting with  each holiday named separately|`|IizPFrELaa	Cause not everyone celebrates Christmas, different "holiday" for different cultures.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	The issue is a serious one.  Christmas is a federal holiday, the proper  greeting is "Merry Christmas."

Racist people on here are just trolls. (or some pathetic loser who doesn't have the guts to say that to the real world) Just ignore 'em. But remember, just because someone doesn't like one person in particular doesn't mean they are racist. Racism is where you believe your race is better than theirs, not by hating them. If someone hates someone for being black, that is bigotry, not racism.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I think the majority of tolerant users on Y!A overrule the racists by far.<br>  And to repeat myself: <br>  I think the majority of tolerant people in the USA overrule the racists by far.|`|ijeninncaa	Haha they'd chicken out if they had to be racist in real life.

My mom did once when she called the police on my sister.|`|NbjU4lxsaa	Hello again, I just answered your other question.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it depends on the parent. If the parent truly cares about you I would think they would shed a single tear. When my mom called the cops on my brother and I she didn't cry at all. She WANTED us gone. When my brother was arrested she was sad, but didn't cry. Apparently, she wasn't very sad because she still threatens to call the cops on us.<br>  <br>  It isn't right. I live in America.

SXwlw9N2aa	I agree I think she is just sickening to watch. I know Lily told her she wanted her to be happy,but being with your best friends ex husband is just not right. She isn't sexy and she is acting like a desperate tramp. I had read a spoiler that Lily was resigning from the Fresh Face campaign, but I had no idea that they are going to replace her with Colleen. That is just awful. She is not attractive at all in my opinion. Maybe with this new career she will have, she will be too busy to chase after Daniel.|`|NXVgwPcZaa	I personally think that she's hot BUT she acts like a tramp.  I can't stand the character of Colleen at ALL.  The one who played her last did a great job.  Butttt then again, the writers are making us all hate Colleen too by her storyline.  I think Colleen should be hit by a bus - and should take Chloe and Lips (Eden) with her.|`|F2cmBaClaa	I do not care for this actress who is playing Collleen....they should bring back the other one!|`|712354e6412161bc717296518b359c6faa	She SUCKS|`|q2Qfkt4Yaa	I wish they'd bring back Adrianne Leon!!!

DIWXc3zbaa	El programa generalmente solo viene en un idioma, si compraste el ingles, no es posible cambiarlo a otro idioma; sin embargo, en mi opinion personal, te recomiendo lo utilices y aprendas en ingles, ya que si en un futuro llegas a trabajar a alguna empresa es muy probable la tengan en ingles; tambien si en un futuro quieres utilizar algunos otros programas cad o de dise?o sera dificil conseguirlos en espa?ol y necesitarias estar traduciendo todos los comandos.<br>  <br>  Otra opcion que tienes es trabajar con los iconos de las barras de herramientas, aunque llegues a trabajar con autocad en otro idioma sabras utilizarlo.|`|f0f4c870ad12139d43fbb6de2e53d737aa	Se puede escoger el idioma George? ups!! si es asi, y lo hiciste en la instalación tal vez tengas que volver a instalarlo.

Ahora me inclino más por las de manteca, que suelen ser más "sanitas".<br>  Es que estoy más viejo y más gorrrdito, y además en Buenos Aires la calidad de las facturas (medialunas y otras variedades) decayó muchísimo en los últimos a?os, y en unas de las que más se siente eso es en las medialunas de grasa. Refinitas, se humedecen enseguida... no tienen el mismo encanto que antes.<br>  En la ruta que va a Mar del Plata, hay un parador enorme que es una fábrica de medialunas famosísima, llamada Atalaya, y son ES-PEC-TA-CU-LA-RES.

1uUQbAvoaa	Es curioso amiga. Una vez estuve en un trabajo de campo antropológico en el que se evalúo la relación entre el docente y el alumno. Después de varios meses de observación salió a relucir ese punto que tu mencionas. Ciertamente los docentes gritan mucho y despues de mucho analizar y comparar casos concluimos que existe un problema grave de autoridad, ya que la forma que el docente encuentra para hacerse obedecer es comportándose como una madre rega?ona en lugar de un guía, lo que trae como consecuencia una respuesta nefasta (agresiva) en el estudiante.<br>  <br>  Nota: esas conclusiones no son generalizables a todos los casos porque ciertamente hay buenos docentes que saben manejar el arte de la autoridad.|`|4435103dd64b840528fd0a6a2541f2d3aa	yo no creo que sean docentes, solo son personas que trabajan en una escuela , "Docentes " eran antes cuando tenian mas vocacion y amor , no las de ahora , estas lo toman como un empleo y nada mas , ademas creo que algunas son unas histericas.|`|AxfBq3aVaa	Quizás justo conoces a lo peor de lo peor!!!<br>  <br>  Es como decir..... por que será que todos los médico andan detrás de las enfermeras.-<br>  O por que todos lo abogados son .....<br>  <br>  Ahhhhhhh..... conozco una docente... que jamás levanta la voz, pero con la cara de ***** que hace, asusta a más de uno.-<br>  Eso si que sin decir una palabra.- (y es peor que un grito....sufrirla)|`|LlG4JDCQaa	siiiiiiiiii!!! jajjaja, supongo que se acostumbran a HABLAR FUERTE porque los chicos en las aulas charlan mucho y no les dan pelota!!!...hasta su timbre de voz es peculiar!!! jajj|`|OOgpn1QLaa	Siempre fueron gritonas<br>  Es que su trabajo impone un grito de vez en cuando<br>  El problema es que últimamente, además de gritonas son bastante deficientes<br>  <br>  Bru|`|da5ed1d71ef688a1c9ffef1e8ed8ae1caa	gracias por los 2 puntos|`|dcJBcuytaa	tu también gritas y no eres docente|`|o5y3okm7aa	porque no tienen paciencia...<br>  <br>  Saludes :)|`|383c03a56bd88f19e3b4c175a5c4814aaa	Por que para eso tienen que tener vocación y la mayoria no la tienen....................

We never were and never will be. The Government puts money over people. Instead it should be the other way around. What a joke these bastards are pulling on us. Fat cats sitting there laughing as they steal our money.<br>  As far as the US being broke.....Yeah we were when Bush was in office. We will never go totally broke because they have this genius idea: Print more money! Yeah, that'll work. It will just drive the value of a dollar into the the ground and once you receive your stimulus, it will be worth half of what it was when it was first issued. We just keep digging that hole.|`|bticQDIhaa	"Do you think the USA is broke from all those stimulus give aways?"<br>  <br>  The country was already pretty deep in debt before the stimulus.

The truth is the truth and nothing but the truth.                         Anyone who says a lie can be any kind of version of the truth is just a liar.  Get it?|`|odu4jOx3aa	depends. <br>  <br>  only some lies, like "streching the truth"<br>  but technically no, the truth is the truth, but you can tell the truth and leave out specific information and that is just as good as a lie|`|aKBqMLuhaa	That sure makes the theory that reality is open to interpretation seem more comprehensible doesn't it?<br>  <br>  I think there is definitely a spectrum that makes it hard to determine absolute truth.|`|90877616d47129b0c2c87f6d63b53f65aa	no... absolutely not... lies are to hide the truth and that's no angle but plain simple lying|`|AA11082713	No,most lies are just flat out bullsh!t...xxx|`|Tk4ifKLiaa	hmmm maybe|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Yes.

She isn't the only one to ever have had cancer and I personally feel that the way she is milking her situation for every penny is disgusting.  She has even offered to die on camera for god's sake!<br>  <br>  It is very sad that she is apparently dying, but the way she is going on you would think she is the world's first cancer victim.  She has no dignity and if she was really in it to make money for her sons she wouldn't be spending ￡1000 on rings for her bridesmaids.<br>  <br>  Once the wedding is over she should just disappear and get some dignity, like the millions of other people who are battling this horrible disease.

AA11027952	Yes people please don't touch!  I personally don't like people in "my space" unless I have given them permission.  I only had that issue (belly touching) during my 1st, but we did find that A LOT of people/stangers felt the need to touch our third baby and still do and that bothers me.  We've even had someone(a total stranger) ask to hold her when we were eating out-just came right up to the table-what's up w/ that?!  I said I'm sorry we don't do that and he smiled and said ok and left.

m4PtEEDNaa	...originally, I was rather put off on the prospective and gimmicky 3D idea for this film, but I decided to give it a chance, anyways. To say that I was freakin' blown away, is a definite understatement; it was one of the best 3D experiences I've had in a long time. The filmmakers took what would have been a fairly ho-hum and run-of-the-mill slasher film remake, and steroid-injected the shocks and the scares, with some of the best make-up special effects, which were astoundingly enhanced by the digital 3D technology. It's one thing to have the occasional jaw-dropping effect thrown at you, but during the entire 100+ minute run of the film, my jaw remained dropped....<br>  <br>  ...the only problem that I had with engaging a viewing of this film, is that apparently, most theaters are charging more for admittance into digital 3D films; a matinee showing of this film, at my local theater, diminished the contents of my wallet, by $11, rather than the normal $7 or $8.....|`|jAoc49N8aa	I am going to see it tonight or tommorow  night|`|8VmahRqtaa	I feel exactly the same way! One my favorite parts was when the killer had Jensen locked up in the cage & then suddenly he was right in front of him, and they stood up in sync. That moment made me think...<br>  And the way Jensen was killing all the lights was sweet. I loved this entire movie and I can't wait to see it again!<br>  Axel and Tom were both so sexy!

tYh73ZnKaa	i would go with the orange. just because other's will choose black.<br>  <br>  but black can go with anything you wear if you care about that.<br>  <br>  but if you don't go with orange.|`|84H5kMD7aa	the orange one is really nice if you like a flashy statement. the black is for a more conservative person. Personally, i would go with the orange!|`|AA10616675	I don't think there is any such thing as the best color on the new nanos. The only one I genuinely don't care for at all is the pink (I got a pink one for my wife though). I opted for a black one, but, really, other than pink, I'd have been cool with any of the choices.<br>  <br>  One small disappointment, which I probably should have known given that it was annodized aluminum, is that the "yellow" is still rather gold looking. Silver is as generic as ever, but the black clickwheel gives it a bit of pop. The purple, red, blue, green, and orange are all really sharp looking in person, and the charcoal (black) runs close to them in snazziness.|`|ze5LAlUPaa	i say it depends on what kind of person you are, if you are happy and fun and you spread joy then choose the orange one because it will reflect on that. if you're kinda serious or just like how slick and cool black looks (like me :)) then choose the black one. I <3 nanos, btw :D

7ba8b2fd4e9d10984fb9932e42a1afa5aa	There are several things you need to work on to correct sing using your diaphragm. Your diaphragm is a support mechanism that should be the foundation of your singing. The correct technique is to expand your lungs fully and fill with air. Once your lungs have the air, your back muscles, rib cage and diaphragm come into play to expel the air in a sustained and consistent column of air. It is this consistent column of air moving over your vocal chords that will give your voice the power and finesse of a good singer.<br>  <br>  What you should look for, if breathing correctly, is your back muscles and rib cage expanding, which also causes the top half of your stomach to expand also. Many people, wrongly, suggest that breathing with your stomach shows you are breathing with your diaphragm, and that is just plain wrong. (If you use your stomach to breath, it will actually move up in your rib cage and push against your lungs, robbing them of space for more air.) Once your back and ribs are expanded, your lungs will fill with air automatically. You do not have to force a breath. Consider this like an empty bottle that you place under water. When you squeeze all the air out, then release, when it expands back to it's original shape, it is filled with water without doing anything else to it. Breathing is exactly the same, when you open your lungs, it will fill with air.<br>  <br>  Your diaphragm, now comes into play in order to support the muscles to push the air out in a controlled manner. When you are supporting this breath, your diaphragm needs to tighten, and push out against and support your back muscles and rib cage in developing the column of air as you exhale. You should feel like you are lifting the heavy end of a piano. Your diaphragm holding everything together in support.<br>  <br>  You do not need "six pack" abs in order to use your diaphragm. You just need to exercise it so you know what the support feels like. This can be as simple as doing breathing exercises. Use your hands, placed around your mid section (top of your belly) and when you breath, feel your back and ribs and top of your belly expand with the breath.<br>  <br>  Here is a good breathing exercise to increase your breathing capacity. When you take a breath, breath everything out, then take a breath as described above., and hold it a couple of seconds, then in a controlled hiss, let it out on a count of 8. By the count of 8, you should have expelled all your air. breath it out evenly so it is all gone at the end of 8. Do this 4 times. Next, repeat the exercise, only hiss out on a count of 12, four times. Work on this for a week, and slowly increase the count by 4 until you can hiss out your note to a count of 16 without dying.<br>  <br>  A new excersize my vocal coach recently gave me is to bend my knees while practicing.  The deeper the knee bend the better.  This excersize causes you to use more of your back and rib muscles to give you support while bending your knees, and these are the same muscles you need to develop for your diaphragm support.  It sounds funny, but just try it.  Bend you knees as much as you can while singing, and make yourself aware of the muscles being used and how they feel, and build that feeling into your singing.|`|lAMXh0bgaa	Keep practicing with a supported diaphram and you'll get stronger with time.  Just dont over-do yourself and get hurt.  My vocal coach has a saying--"if it hurts, dont do it".  Which is a pretty good thing to go by.|`|74209f509512526a7c775597bcd23f8eaa	I intend to begin to sing in a few months from now and know nothing on this topic at this point. However, I do know we all have limitations that we may not like imposed upon us, but we have to learn to live with them. <br>  Singing can be no different and no exception, there has to be a limitation imposed on each of us, different and unique. If we could do one thing to take us to a specific place then we could all end up at that same point, and sameness would be the overall effect. The Arts is not about sameness but is about exploiting those limitations we each have, those things that make " Us" unique and different. Can you do what you anticipate.. I don't know but perhaps...so try it out for a while and you'll know. If not though i would work with what you got and the range your capable of.<br>

While father Tom (Chevy Chase), a struggling meteorologist, battles with his producer over whether wearing outrageous outfits will boost his ratings, his 10-year-old daughter, Natalie (Zena Grey), forges a bitter battle with the local snowplow driver (the always funny Chris Elliott). His menacing snowplow threatens to clean the roads before the authorities can grant the kids a second consecutive snow day. Also thrown into the mix is the teenager Hal (Mark Webber), who is too obsessed with the beautiful Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui) to realize that his best friend, Lane (Schuyler Fisk), has a crush on him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Snow Job<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.find-dvd.co.uk/D094769.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.find-dvd.co.uk/D094769.htm</a><br>  <br>  Iatt Raymond (Milo Ventimiglia) heads to Wall Street and a big shot job whilst his best friends Carter (Eddie Mills) and Pete (Eddie Kaye Thomas) large it up on the ski slopes of Aspen Colorado for a year.

SiehdCw0aa	I will try question 2...<br>  the singing one...<br>  Yes there are tapes or cds to help train your voice...<br>  also you could try covering your ears or one ear, and then singing softly, so you will finally hear your voice in your head, and then experiment on how to make it sound the way you want...<br>  <br>  try it it really works, all in all it takes practice...like doing your do re mee's on different starting notes, and seeing how low you can go and then how high... Practice....

WpY9ZeP0aa	Sadly, I'm too tired to recall any off the top of my head, but I just want to make sure you have an understanding as to how they tell their jokes. The show isn't prejudice towards any races, rather it's satirical content points out social stereotypes. In other words, if you think Family Guy is prejudice you're going down the wrong path, it's the same with South Park.|`|UphoLYGYaa	They pretty much joke about every race on this show. I would suggest renting it seeing for yourself.  There are way to many jokes to single out one.  Rent the seasons, or watch it on fox, tbs, or cartoon network's adult swim.|`|eVHYVhEPaa	i love that show!<br>  <br>  go to www.familyguytube.com<br>  <br>  i watch them all there and some of them r so funny! give it a go|`|gQXdEY4Taa	Peter refers to Clevland's son as a Jemima's Witness because he came to their house holding a plate of pancakes and because he's black.

27wbDeTUaa	yes I do believe the music business needs a jump start what needs to happen is for people to stop down loading music and start buying the CD and for the record labels to produce a CD that cant be down loaded and other musicians need to join me in reviving live music|`|58f5c739ccc1b4a34c600b8c61697000aa	Definitly!<br>  I think the music industry needs to pay more attention to stuff that isn't just mainstream because most of the main stream stuff is sh!t. Also they need to actually start promoting bands with talent. Talent isn't a word you'll often hear when talking about current music, well the mainstream at least. Does it take talent to sing a rap song? No! Does it take talent to make any of the current popular pop or rock songs? No!<br>  And everyone only ever cares about singles now it seems. Albums need to really improve because it seems a lot of the current albums have 1 or 2 singles and the rest of the songs make the sad attempt at a song released as a single look good.|`|sZ43o3r7aa	The music industry need s to stop promoting all this pop stuff and start promoting REAL music, music that can last and have a stable fan base. Music has to be be less about the money and kicking a good/catchy single out and be more about making a good album. Bands who are acually amazing are hitting it harder than alot of talentless bands just because they're not "marketable".

2da0a7aedcf0f2964283d4563d1577adaa	Sometimes bands have autograph sessions before the show (usually after soundcheck which is like 3-4) or after the show. These are usually either fanclub members or radio station contest winners. Once in awhile they might have a signing at a mall, but it's rare.|`|CQfnd75daa	Um well sometimes after the bands play there set, they sometimes walk around the venue to sign autographs or you have to be part of there fan club to go to there meet and greet. (if its the main performance) and if your not going to the concert youd just have to find there buses.

I NEVER TRUSTED HIM!!|`|N3z1gnziaa	Zac Efron and her are dating now and she felt the courage to take a few naked pictures of herself and send them to Zac to make him "Horny". When people started hearing about it they freaked fired her from Disney, put the pictures on the web, many young girls found out about it and she is no longer thier role model.

Those pics somehow made their way onto the internet and now the whole Disney world has turned upside down.<br>  <br>  It's kinda sad.  Right now millions of ppl (mostly boys and perverted old men) are looking at her naked pics and salavating over them.  She's prolly ruined, embarassed, disgraced and humiliated that this happened.  And, on top of it all, she may loose out on the whole HMS3 movie -- and maybe even her career.<br>  <br>  The pics are all over the net: one in her underwear, one in a sexy cat-like pose also in her undies, and one totally naked.

N9DwYLqxaa	It is because they're not on top right now.....If you go back to 1991-1996 when the West Coast and Death Row Records was on top those East Coast cats did the same thing.....We know that hip hop/rap was founded in New York....but damn let us shine.......but if they really want to take it back Hip Hop came from the Blues and R&B Soul which is Southern......HOLLA <br>  <br>  I would take Scarface, Ludacris, Lil Wayne, and Outkast over any East Coast rapper any day !!!!!!!!!!!|`|1wkvWpelaa	u prolly couldnt understand the wu tang lyrics. the south generally slack on wordplay and have simple one syllable rhymes. not all but alot|`|6a29gpqCaa	lol...i love how fans try to create regional wars based on what they read on the internet<br>  <br>  give me the specific name of an east coast rapper who is "hatin" on southern rapperS.........im not sayin one region is better than the other, but i think its funny how people are quick to throw out the "quit hatin the south" card, yet the only people hatin the south are southern rappers hatin on each other|`|Ke7tE34uaa	i think its the beat.

VDMZhQLTaa	In the right hand, you play a D, F sharp, and A.<br>  In the left hand, you play a simple E. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gGWN6GmIaa	The chord you are playing is a D chord.  The notes you should play are D F# A.  The E refers to the bass note (played with the left hand, depending on the voicing).  This is how I would voice this chord: Octave E's in the left hand, D F# A D in the right.  That is, if you can reach an octave in both hands. Good Luck!!

Con la batuta en su mano derecha indica a los <br>  músicos el tempo (velocidad) al marcar los compases. Con la mano izquierda <br>  se?ala el Volúmmen y las entradas. en oportunidades, se ayuda con la mirada <br>  para dar las entradas a los diversos instrumentos. Con su expresión corporal <br>  le ′da la intensidad (fuerza) a la interpretación. Aunque estoy consciente <br>  que hay algo de show en sus movimientos, el director trasmite su intención <br>  en los mismos . POr último, la elegancia, prestancia y energía son las <br>  cualidades que debe tener un director pero el resultado solo se ve en la <br>  interpretación que el buen escucha sabe apreciar. Saludos cordiales desde <br>  caracas, Venezuela.|`|e05aedeb574ea6aa8c9a733c3e529db2aa	entradas y salidas de cada grupo de intrumentos<br>  subidas y bajadas de tono y cuando son sostenidos|`|u8G12x8Uaa	El director de una orquesta va dirigiendo el compas y la velocidad del concierto.|`|2kUXLsU9aa	DEPENDIENDO EN QUE TN ALTO EN QUE TAN BAJO ESTEN SUS MANOS PARA PODER SUBIR O BAJAR EL VOLUMEN <br>  Pues para indicar la intensidad,la velocidad y la entrada de cada instrumento.<br>  <br>  SI KIERES MAS INFO ACERCA DE INTRUMENTO U OTROS <br>  <a href="http://www.suzukimusica.com.pe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.suzukimusica.com.pe/</a><br>  <br>  YO PERNESCO A ESTA ORGANIZACI9ON QUE PREPARA METODOS DE INSTRUMENTACION|`|4091ff3822c01649f8dbc819a3a2dc01aa	Indica el tipo de compas, tiempo, ritmo, cuando entra cada instrumento, el volumen con el que debe tocar la orquesta o banda, entre otras cosas.|`|5PYLGxN9aa	Indican la intensidad, la velocidad, el tiempo la entrada y la salida de los instrumentos. Mis maestros de música me han dicho que cada director tiene una forma especial de dirigir, esto se debe a que cada uno dirige lo que ve en la música. Si te das cuenta algunos hasta hacen movimientos raros.<br>  Por ejemplo, si ellos ven que alguna parte de la melodía suena como si se desataran las olas del mar, ellos con su brazo tratan de hacer el movimiento del mar. Pero lo mas importante es lo que te dije en el principio.|`|6327b33e13f44ea2d1eab18a86115184aa	Bueno de hecho cada director impone su estilo y método personal para cada interpretación orquestal y que estan determinados en la base académica que reciben y a su experiencia interpretativa para manipular con la mano izquierda la "Batuta" de dirección a la cual semanifiesta en el tipo de obra por dirigir y entonar apropiadamente. <br>  <br>  No tienen que ser movimientos de obrservacion obligatorias consistentemente, quiero decir.|`|78a98pAuaa	se?ala la entrada de los instrumentos la salida, pone el tempo de la obra, marca el compas, la dinamica los matices, la intensidad, la expresividad de la obra, un buen director no solo dirige con las manos sino con todo el cuerpo|`|8XykDWB8aa	Glpea con su batuata el atril para llamar la atención de lo músicos y les da ódenes moviendo la batuta y la mano izquierda|`|JSExOLMhaa	Mira... considera esto:<br>  <br>  Son deberes del director de orquesta llevar el tempo (ver compás), indicar la entrada de grupos instrumentales individuales (ver orquesta), marcar los acentos dinámicos (ver dinámica) y llevar a cabo cualquier otra instrucción relevante dejada en la partitura por el compositor.<br>  <br>  También son deberes del director de orquesta coordinar los ensayos y resolver disputas y desacuerdos entre los músicos dentro de ellos.<br>  <br>  La mayoría de los directores utilizan para dar sus indicaciones, además de gestos, un peque?o palo llamado batuta.<br>  <br>  Se ha dicho por esto que ninguna versión de una pieza es exactamente igual a otra, ni siquiera cuando son hechas por un mismo director en dos ocasiones distintas. Por ejemplo, Igor Stravinski, quién dirigió al menos seis grabaciones de su obra La consagración de la primavera, notó que cada una de ellas era marcadamente diferente de las otras.<br>  <br>  A veces, si el compositor o compositora está presente en los ensayos de su obra, puede cambiar de opinión acerca de lo que escribió en la partitura e informárselo al director. En ocasiones, algunos directores se interesan por conocer bien no solo la obra que dirigirán sino también al mismo compositor: sus gustos, conocimientos musicales y maestría, pues consideran que es esencial para una ejecución de calidad. Este es normalmente el caso ante el estreno mundial de la obra.<br>  <br>  Cabe notar, también, que si un director es incompetente, la orquesta, si es muy buena, puede lograr organizarse por su cuenta sin mucha dificultad. Dependiendo del caso, la orquesta puede acordar ignorar al director durante el acto y dejarle recibir el aplauso, o puede acordar a seguirle al pie de la letra y arruinar la interpretación.<br>  <br>  Espero que mi explicacion te ayude de algo....<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|k1tLtQ5daa	solo se que mueve su varita magica para que la orquesta toque bien|`|MUBO5LDfaa	con las manos indica el tiempo o el ritmo, tambien indica los instrumentos que tienen que resaltar y con las se?as indica los que tienen que sonar mas fuertes o mas despacios (forte o piano)  y con la intensidad que tienen que tocar la melodia u obra.|`|N7BmIKUAaa	Cuando les mueve la barita con la mano a todos les esta queriendo decir "al que se desafine le meto esto por el re menor"|`|abZj4jS3aa	marca el tiempo, las entradas de cada instrumento y los matices (la intensidad del sonido mas fuerte mas suave)|`|f0tQUaHsaa	Les se?ala el tiempo en que debe entrar cada instrumento, la intensidad de sonido (bajo, alto) <br>  Puede incluso cambiar la entrada de determinado instrumento, aunque en la partitura este marcado el tiempo en que debe entrar el instrumento...<br>  Por eso son virtuosos y por eso se quemaron las pesta?as un buen de a?os y tener un oido magnifico para conocer el sonido de todos los instrumentos de una orquesta..<br>  hay algunos directores que usan solo sus manos eso es mas admirable.<br>  saludos|`|zVPXviIhaa	Los movimientos de la batuta indican el tempo de una obra,la salida y entrada de los instrumentos,por eso hay versiones muy diferentes de una sola obra,hay directores que utilizan un tempo màs lento que otros y la duraciòn de la pieza puede variar.

Pero si los educas para que sean seres independientes y due?os de su vida. Ello se reflejará en todas las acciones de su vida en la que estarás incluido.

AvuLjk3kaa	?Excelente pregunta!<br>  <br>  Me he preguntado lo mismo cuando veo texto escritos de una manera ridícula, casi incomprensible.  Normalmente, esos textos  los paso por alto y no me preocupo por leerlos.  Los considero una falta de respeto hacia los participantes que se esfuerzan por escribir bien el idioma castellano. Y su contenido casi siempre refleja el bajo nivel cultural de quienes los escriben.<br>  <br>  No encuentro una razón válida del por qué lo hacen.  Por ignorancia,  por rebeldía o por resentimiento contra quién sabe qué,  pero por alguna razón se empe?an en escribir de esa manera..<br>  <br>  Pero debe ser más difícil escribir así que hacerlo correctamente.<br>  <br>  Pero el mundo es así.  Hay de todo.  <br>  <br>  Mi saludo y mi respeto para todos.|`|30510d03539d68f61c1995f393028afeaa	yo siempre escribo lo mas correcto que puedo y de verdad que ahí veces que no entiendo ni lo que ponen en las preguntas y respuestas con esa manera de escribir <br>  saludos y una estrellita para ti muy buena pregunta|`|WT18mjWbaa	Es verdad.

3LQKcuutaa	Bien dicen que el amor entra por los ojos,  debido a la belleza fisica de la persona mmm .. algo te atrae, en la mayoria de los casos, pero para mi la que si es ndispensable para iniciar una relación amorosa es la belleza interior, es la que realmente vale la pena en una persona. Para que andar con na persona bella fisicamente si te vas a aburrir o desesperar cada que estes a su lado. Suerte y sonrie!|`|0huOTX8Waa	Normalmente , me acercaba a mujeres que me fueran atractivas a la vista..<br>  <br>  Por consecuencia dejaba en segundo o tercer plano...sus valores o sentimientos.....<br>  <br>  El 12 de Noviembre conocí en este foro..una mujer...A quien conocí de ella en primera instancia ...sus valores y sus sentimientos.....Para no hacer una historia larga...les digo , que ahora es ella quien ocupa mis pensamientos , ella es quien ocupa mi corazón...y es AMOR  la mujer que amo y es la mujer con quien deseo pasar el resto de mi vida.<br>  <br>  Lo que me conquisto fue su belleza interior..<br>  <br>  Mauricio|`|1DTkvLbeaa	La belleza es fundamental para que nos sintamos bien con alguin. Sin embargo cabe destacar que la belleza es subjetiva, por lo que alguien puede ser bello para mi y feo para muchos. También entiendo que la belleza va unida al físico y al alma (por decirlo de algún modo). Unos ojos pueden der bonitos, pero también puede serlo un gesto, el tono de voz, la intención....|`|3c23f7101ef5bc41d5f752c8db9523cdaa	importa la belleza interior y obviamente la exterior tambien pero la mas importante es la interior porque no sirve de nada tener un buen fisico si no se siente nada por el lado sentimental para tener una relacion seria|`|LEPUWqS5aa	si la verdad se olle superficial pero si es indispensable o dime tu ?andarias con una chava... tu sabes con granitos lentes gordita y eso? no verdad pues ahi tienes|`|NGkiauyOaa	Es que la belleza como tal es un concepto ambiguo en la mente de las personas.<br>  Si por belleza te refieres a un estandar estetico actual (osea como una modelo), no creo que se asi super esencial salir con Adriana Lima para iniciar una relacion.<br>  Pero siendo menos exagerados, si belleza es un concepto que se desprende de ti (osea tu ves bonito o bien a alguien) pues si creo que es una parte importante que a ti te agrade la persona, aunque para mi, la atraccion es lo basico para iniciar una relacion, por que es lo que te impulsa a acercarte (atraccion fisica)  ya despues vas creando otro vinculo (la relacion en si)|`|NNitXQQ3aa	te debes fijar en lo de adentro primero, aunque uno siempre mira la belleza exterior, pero en realidad que prefieres, una chica no tan guapa que te quiera un monton, o una guapisima que se puede encontarar otro hombre a la vuelta de la esquina|`|On2FhaJoaa	SI MUCHO...PERO SI ES HUECO POR DENTRO DE NADA LE SERVIRíA...<br>  ...|`|SznNThUkaa	A las ?i?itas lelas si!!

5KBOel7Jaa	Hola amigo como estas!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Muy buena pregunta, por ello ya te tengo en mi lista de preferidas.<br>  <br>  Hace poco leí en una pregunta en la que Perú contrario a lo que muchos piensan esta mejorando su economía y de hecho es líder de este proceso en Latinoamérica según el BM.<br>  <br>  Todo en la vida, siempre que existan las posibilidades es posible, Colombia últimamente viene desempe?ando un buen papel, su política de gobierno en este sentido se ha venido comprometiendo mucho con el desarrollo del sector empresarial, sin embargo, paradójico a lo que muchos piensan, Se ha venido desarrollando una brecha, pues son las Grandes empresas las que mayor se benefician en este crecimiento económico, pero lo importante es que en parte vamos por buen camino y nuestra economía mejora arduamente gracias a muchos factores.<br>  <br>  Colombia es muy atractiva para muchos inversionistas, esto genera a la vez que nuestra bolsa de valores mejore su rentabilidad.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, el problema de la bolsa de USA es algo efímero, hay que manejarlo con tranquilidad.<br>  <br>  Al punto que quiero llegar amigo, es que si es posible superar a estos países, pero para ello debemos invertir más en materia de educación que es para mi el aspecto prioritario, pues son muchos los países que lo han demostrado.<br>  <br>  Es decir, si los países que mencionaste quieren ser líderes en América  deben comprometerse demasiado y generar grandes ideas que les permita a su población acabar con la Brecha social, económica y tecnológica que nos agobia.<br>  <br>  Hago fuerza por Colombia.<br>  <br>  Saludos y va una estrella por tu buena pregunta|`|KA0s52Gfaa	MEXICO... país de drogas, corrupción, pobreza, inmigrantes hacia EEUU, descontrol político, etc<br>  <br>  PERú: un país que ha logrado subir su nivel desde el último presidente, pero no olvidemos que es un ladron....<br>  TENGAN CUIDADO CON ESE TIPO.<br>  LA MEMORIA ES FUERTE!!!...

Llevaba prisioneros de distintos sistemas planetarios en estado de extásis. El capitán de esa nave (en el presente Jacob) es una entidad no-material que sólo puede establecer contacto con algunas personas de sensibilidad muy especial y sólo a nivel mental. El primer contacto con la humanidad fue con un barco de piratas (el Roca Negra) cuyos tripulantes fueron tomados por los prisioneros de la nave alienígena. El capitán de ese barco es actualmente el lugarteniente de Ben (cuyo aspecto habrán notado que no ha cambiado desde que Ben era un ni?o). Los prisioneros en sus nuevos cuerpos se convirtieron en los Otros., menos Humo ***** el cual es incompatible con nuestra fisiología y está condenado a vagar por la isla alimentándose del miedo que provoca. Los otros no se llevan bien con Jacob, pero lo necesitan porque necesitan de la tecnología de la nave para atraer más humanos e impedir su escape. Necesitan de los humanos cuando se deterioran sus cuerpos y cuando nos parasitan es imposible la reproducción. Por esa razón conspiraron junto a Ben (ya que puede comunicarse con Jacob) para asesinar a los científicos de la Iniciativa Dharma, quienes habían llegado a la isla para investigar con la complicidad de los Otros para que descubrieran porque no era posible la reproducción. A cambio de eso les permitirían investigar los "peculiares" campos energéticos de la isla que en principio impedían envejecer y curaban las heridas.Lo malo es que en algún punto posiblemente descubrieron la verdad y eso los llevó a la muerte. Ahora los Otros se encuentran con un nuevo  problema con el que no contaban :otra persona que también puede comunicarse con Jacob: John Locke que se trasformará en el futuro en la pieza desencadenante de la trama (y que contaré en futuras entregas). En esta nueva temporada aparece involucrado el gobierno de EEUU quien ha detectado la fuente de energía (que ya sabe que no proviene de tecnología de este mundo) cuando explotó el reactor de la escotilla de Desmond y ha enviado un portaaviones a la isla bajo la apariencia de un supuesto rescate... aparece en escena la conspiración... Me gustaría poder seguir contando sobre el desenlace (que puedo asegurarles que si lo tiene y del que sólo puedo adelantar por ahora que toda la Humanidad va estar en juego...) pero se me acabó la "merca" y no puedo seguir volando...|`|VMJVl2yKaa	Acabo de ver el tercer capitulo de la cuarta temporada y pasa algo asi la isla se dividio en los que creian que los van a rescatar y en los que no, saiyd va en busca del barco en el helicoptero pero el tambien es uno de los 6 sobrevivientes por lo que en el futuro se une a Ben para Matar a los que saben lo que pasa en la isla que fueron los que enviaron al quipo de rescate que no es tal sino un grupo de cientificos contratados para averiguar que es lo que pasa en la isla porque no pasa el tiempo etc...<br>  lo bueno es que van los 6 a volver y descubriran que es lo que pasa.|`|YXVqjYsyaa	para mi el papa es jacob no se si vieron los mini capitulos por el celular pero en uno el papa de jack le dice a vincent(el perro) que despierte a jack por que tiene trabajo que hacer y vincent lo despierta y ahi es cuando empieza el primer capitulo de la serie ademas en el flashfoward jack dice"compareme con mi papa y si yo estoy mas borracho que el no hago  la cirujia" asi que al parecer esta vivo ademas el papa conocia a muchos de los personajes<br>  <br>  ademas en la cuarta hurley lo ve sentado en la mesedora de jacob|`|e93f3a3fe40c3cb7eefd0b7ce3a84697aa	es indescifrable ,vi el 2do cap de la cta temp.ta esta en el ares y cada vez te rompe mas la cabeza|`|62P1d6A5aa	En el ultimo capitulo se revela que la serie es en relalidad un video juego manejado por Bill Gates.|`|69b95e34bc8da5a2e136347d56b31281aa	Voy a fundar " El escuadron Dharma" e irme con mis seguidores a Australia, poco antes que termine la serie, y si no le dan sentido a todas las cosas que pasaron desde el primer capitulo buscare y asesinare a todos los productores directores y guionistas por hacerme perder tanto tiempo frente al televisor, seguidores no me faltan...|`|768i1cTJaa	NO ESTAN NI MUERTOS NI EN EL LI,MBO..

El problema real aparece cuando Ben vuelve para raptar al bebé (que es muy "especial") y cuando Jack se entera de esto, hace lo posible para evitarlo. Sin embargo esto no refrena su cólera y celos por el hijo tenido entre Kate y Sawyer. Los Oceanic 6 son nada más y nada menos que Jack, Kate, Hurley, Desmond, Sayid (no muere, manga de pelotudos!!!) y por supuesto Locke. <br>  <br>  A continuación contaré cómo mueren los otros personajes:<br>  <br>  . Juliette: Miles la caga a tiros antes de salir de la isla, pero también muere él al enfrentarse con Jack, que de la bronca lo caga a piedrazos en la cara. La entierran en la isla y en pleno proceso de luto, Vincent le lame las gomas.<br>  <br>  . Sawyer: en el capítulo 12, tal vez el más emocionante de la saga, salva a Kate en pleno tiroteo contra los supuestos "rescatadores" y finalmente muere en brazos de Pecas. Duro capítulo, a más de uno se le plantará un lagrimón. <br>  <br>  . Claire y su bebé: ambos mueren por un virus incubado durante los meses de permanencia en la isla. La cunita es quemada junto con sus cadáveres.<br>  <br>  . La negra y su marido: mueren al caer del helicóptero que los rescataba al pegar ella un resbalón. El marido no la quería soltar así que ambos al agua pato. Lo mejor de este capítulo es la toma aérea que muestra perfectamente las aletas de tiburones acercándose a ellos.<br>  <br>  . Sun y Jin: ella se indigesta con un brócoli de su plantación y así muere el bebé. él es inyectado con veneno de un pez globo mientras lo estaba cazando. Hurley lo encuentra y a él le cuenta el secreto de la isla pero no le entiende un carajo porque se lo cuenta en coreano.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  Si me olvido de algunoss, seguramente la humareda negra se los garchó. Todo lo contado aquí es cierto, no sean pelotudos y desconfiados.|`|Cr95gYdVaa	Lost es una analogia de lo que es nuestro bendito pais Argentina !, todo es un despelote, nadie entiende nada y encima hay que bancarse a "los otros" que te joden todo el tiempo....algo mas parecido a nosotros?|`|D8zEFjFyaa	es un reality show...<br>  el 'humito *****' es cualquiera....q sea un humo y haga tanto ruido de king kong....me encanta la serie, pero he empezado a ver la 4ta y hay cosas q cada vez son mas masticadas....es como todas las series que las hacen durar mas de tres temporadas..ya no saben q inventar...esperemo q al final no la caguen...<br>  que Swayer termine con Kate y que Jack haga de su vida un culo por q me cae mal...<br>  Mickel tiene q volver, hay q darle unas cuantas bofetadas...a Locke hay q tirarlo al fondo del oceano atado a su adorada silla de ruedas...<br>  Charlie tiene q volver....no pudo haber muerto...tan idiota era? si cerraba la puerta y el se quedaba con Desmond...?No era lo mismo? pero no..el tenia q encerarse con el agua, y ni siquiera trato de salir por la escotilla...muy feo....feo feo feo....|`|DJK9djSjaa	Termina cuando llega Mario Baracus con Anibal Smith y Fast arriba del helicoptero volado por Murdock para rescatarlos, pero antes tienen que luchar contra las demoníacas fuerzas de Skeletor.

La continuacion de la conmocionante y exitosa miniserie norteamericana. Yo ya estoy enterado del final de Lost version 1. Esta tan cerrada la historia que parece mentira, me decian los creadores, uno de ellos a quien yo le practico sexo oral habitualmente o anal de vez en cuando.<br>  Resulta que llega a la isla Panam, y todos los chicos Lost se dan cuenta de que estaban usurpando la isla de una cantante mediocre y con fama mentirosa de querer a los chicos. Panam justo llegaba de unas vacaciones con Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan y Cris Morena, que se habian tomado juntas en Chascomus. Se encuentran con que un Lost quiere abusarse de su dinosaurio caga pelotas y le rompe la nariz y el muere. Se comienzan a agarrar a trompadas entre todos y mueren varios. La isla se separa en 2 y se hacen la guerra. Muere de sobredosis Britney mientras Lindsay Lohan le estaba lavando la vagina. Lindsay, Cris y Panam, deciden preparar una emboscada y crean un prostibulo para que los machos Lost descarguen su guasca ahi... entonces los van matando 1 a 1. Finalmente quedan solo mujeres de un lado y solo mujeres del otro.<br>  En una guerra de tampones, ya en el ultimo capitulo, muchas de las chicas Lost quedan si un ojo y Cris Morena recibe heridas multiples que le causan la muerte.<br>  Finalmente deciden terminar con las peleas y se hacen amigas para siempre todas y juegan a la soga diariamente. Panam y Lindsay Lohan comienzan una historia de lesbianismo xxx y crean la sede de las tortas Lost en la isla, recibiendo mensualmente a miles de turistas lesbianas que van a visitarla. Las chicas Lost algunas se dedican a servicios sexuales y otras son mozas.<br>  Un final feliz y lleno de emocion!<br>  Espero que me esten super agradecidos todos, esta info es real, ya lo veran!<br>  Vayan preparandose para "Lost, so Lost since you love go!" que llega en el 2009 para dejarlos con la boca abierta.<br>  besos en la pancita a todos!<br>  <br>  Andy Schiffer|`|WXUmeez8aa	Estimado Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Yo no se, porque yo no vi esta serie porque me aburre siempre.

El nuevo modelo, basado en las leyes de la mecánica cuántica, elimina la famosa paradoja que rodea la idea de viajar en el tiempo. <br>  <br>  Una explicación <br>  <br>  Pese a que las leyes de física en teoría permitirían el viaje en el tiempo, el concepto tiene contradicciones incómodas. El principal dolor de cabeza surge de la idea que uno podría alterar el presente si cambia el pasado, y esa teoría entrevera toda la teoría de viaje en el tiempo. <br>  <br>  Claramente el presente nunca es alterado por viajeros en el tiempo: las personas no desaparecen súbitamente, eso es obvio. Entonces, o no es posible viajar en el tiempo o hay algo que actúa y previene que cualquier movimiento hacia el pasado altere el presente. <br>  <br>  Para la mayoría de nosotros la primera opción es la más probable, sin embargo, la teoría de la Relatividad de Albert Einstein conduce a algunos físicos a optar por la segunda. De acuerdo a Einstein, el tiempo-espacio puede curvarse sobre sí mismo, lo que en teoría permitiría que los viajeros regresaran y se encontraran con versiones más jóvenes de ellos mismos. <br>  <br>  Los expertos creen ahora que esa situación se puede dar sólo si existen algunas limitaciones físicas que actúan para proteger el presente de cualquier cambio en el pasado. <br>  <br>  Leyes extra?as <br>  <br>  El equipo de investigadores opina que estas limitaciones existen debido las extra?as leyes de la mecánica cuántica. El comportamiento cuántico es gobernado por probabilidades. Antes de que algo sea observado tiene un número de probabilidades sobre su condición o forma. <br>  <br>  Pero una vez que es observado y medido las probabilidades se reducen a una, la incertidumbre es eliminada. <br>  <br>  De acuerdo a la nueva teoría no se puede viajar a salvar a Kennedy. Entonces, si uno conoce el presente, no puede alterar el pasado. Volviendo a los padres, si uno sabe que están vivos en la actualidad, no existe posibilidad alguna de que mueran en el pasado. <br>  <br>  Lo del título, ya se puede viajar al pasado con tranquilidad... a menos que usted planee regresar a Dallas el 22 de noviembre de 1963... en ese caso no podrá salvar a John F. Kennedy... <br>  <br>  BBC de Londres<br>   <br>  El hecho es que el viaje en el tiempo seria un hecho previamente dado como parte de la linea normal del tiempo, las acciones que hagamos si viajarmos en el tiempo no podrian ser drasticas por x o y razon.<br>  <br>  Suerte

Aún guardo viejas cartas donde me escribían: "sos el amor de mi vida", "voy a quedarme para siempre a tu lado y jamás te abandonaré", "te amaré por siempre",... y al poquito tiempo ya estaban con otra persona y nunca más nos volvimos a ver... recuerdo cómo lloraba cuando sola las leía una y otra vez... pero es parte de la vida y del aprendizaje, de crecer y madurar... y hoy son bonitos recuerdos. En su momento (cuando las escribieron) tal vez lo sentían así, y yo también lo he echo y lo sentía, luego las cosas cambian. Lo feo es cuando se escriben o se dicen sin realmente sentirlo. Hoy tengo más cuidado, ya no soy adolescente, y lo digo cuando realmente estoy segura para no lastimar a nadie y no lastimarme a mí misma. Buena tu pregunta, te dejo estrellita.

Estas pasando por una situación dificíl, pero piensa, es mejor que tus padres se divorcien que su relacion de deteriore mas y mas,<br>   Te recomiendo que no "molestes" a tus padadre. Ya que ellos lo ultimo que quieren es verte triste. Además ellos tambien tinen que "dijerir" la situación, y sí tu vas y les empesas a decír que estas triste, es el peor día de tu vida, etc, los vas a poner en una situación peor. Lo mejor que puedes hacer ahora es distraerte, se que es dificíl, pero es lo mejor que puedes hacer. Y acompa?ala a tu madre, pero, como ya te dije, no la pongas en una situacion peor, simplemente "acompa?ala".<br>  <br>  Yo tambien he vivido la separacion de mis padres.

WczfHz6Jaa	Well it's difficult to actually get that good, unless it comes naturally already. It depends on your age too. If you are still young then you have a better chance than if your in your 20's say. <br>  <br>  Can I suggest a course such as Musical Theatre BTEC in order to improve your singing. I'm currently doing it and having the time of my life. You could then go onto training schools such as LIPA in Liverpool and study pop singing or similar.<br>  <br>  To be honest though unless you have the determination, discipline and passion to become a singer you aren't going to get there. You must be disciplined in order to practice every single day for at least an hour (as if you were playing a real instrument)<br>  <br>  And don't enter a talent competition - let the talent find you and you blossom from that. Maybe get an agent - who can sort you gigs in clubs etc to give you the confidence.<br>  <br>  It all comes with work, determination and money. It aint a cheap career - trust me!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  xxx|`|xtKKYu53aa	I think it's more than talent...you need to KNOW people...which is very unfortunate.<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind as well:<br>  <br>  Singing as a hobby is quite different from singing as a career. And while you might have your mind and heart set to becoming a professional singer, chances are, you have absolutely no idea how or where to start. Rest assured, however, that this uncertainty is perfectly normal. Nearly all of today's famous singers were once in the same position as you are now.<br>  <br>  There is no single correct way to become a professional singer. If you start asking different artists you'll probably get different answers. Many times, an aspiring singers starts as a member of a local band and then proceeds to a solo career. Other times, artists have started as back-up singer for famous artists and then went on to start their own career. Cher is an example of such an artist.<br>  <br>  Of course, before attempting to follow any of these routes above, you need to make sure you have certain skills that are necessary to all singers. First of all, you need to be able to sing to a tune, project your voice effectively and generally understand the mechanics of good vocal delivery.<br>  <br>  Another important quality you should have as a singer is to be able to define your own style. Don't be afraid to experiment with phrasing and vocal riffs. If you manage to create your own unique style of singing then you're much more likely to have a serious singing career.<br>  <br>  As a final note, be prepared to make sacrifices and have a lot of patience until you first see your name on a CD cover. You might have to start off as an amateur singer, or spend long nights in the recording studio. But be sure that every single professional artist you ask will tell you that in the end, it was definitely worth it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay determined!

She learns that she's pregnant from a one-time sexual encounter with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker. Juno and Paulie like each other, but don't consider themselves to be exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend let alone be ready to be a family complete with child. Although she would rather not be pregnant, Juno is fairly pragmatic about her situation. Although there, Paulie really leaves all the decisions about the baby to Juno. Initially she decides that she will have an abortion, but that's something that she ultimately cannot go through with. So she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption. But first she has to tell her father, Mac, and stepmother, Bren, that she is pregnant. Although they would have preferred if Juno was on hard drugs or expelled from school, Mac and Bren too are pragmatic about Juno's situation. The next step is to find prospective parents for the yet unborn child. In the Pennysaver ad section, Juno finds Mark and Vanessa Loring, a yuppie couple living in the suburbs. Juno likes the Lorings, and in some respects has found who looks to be a kindred spirit in Mark, with whom she shares a love of grunge music and horror films. Vanessa is a little more uptight and is the one in the relationship seemingly most eager to have a baby. On her own choosing, Juno enters into a closed rather than open adoption contract with the Lorings - meaning she will have no contact with the baby after she gives it up. During the second and third trimesters of Juno's pregnancy which she treats with care but detachment, Juno's relationships with her family, with Paulie, and with the Lorings develop, the latter whose on the surface perfect life masks some hidden problems. And yes, it's a really good movie, very funny, and has a great plot, I believe.|`|UCpJwzqnaa	It's about a teenager getting pregnant and giving her baby up for adoption to a couple that can not have children of their own.

HDvsMKEaaa	Hello respected future singer Meredith,<br>  You know there is nothing about age for a girl to be a singer. Only male voice changes between 12-15th age. So don't bother about that.<br>  Listen read carefully the following<br>  1. To be a Great singer always coaching is not necessary you may it without coaching<br>  2. What u need is a basic idea of Notes, Scales, Pitches, Cleffs and especially musical ornaments<br>  3. I request u to learn atleast the above words before you visit any competitions which will help u a lot with less efforts especially ornaments<br>  4. Dont think that others have sung and made CDs u might have not seen there efforts<br>  5. Always breathing techniques also improve your voice and singing techniques<br>  6. Always record ur voice on pc while singing and analyse as audience then u may find ur own error and recorrect it.<br>  7. Whenever u record your voice with a song please apply echo, reverb and a compressor (dont worry if u dont know, read last point if u dont know) by which a singer voice gets final touch up like as it is in the CD music.<br>  8. Try to sing with an instrument so that u r maintaing a good note and  perfect. <br>  9. If u dont have ur own instrument don worry, download songbird suite software which is free, in which you will get piano. Press the keys and try to sing like how they sound<br>  10. Even after this if u have confusion or don't understand, please send me a bit of your song recorded on pc in the mp3 format to my email Id. I will process ur voice with compressor, reverb and echo so that u will hear voice as it was recorded in a studio. Then u will come to know how ur voice will be when it is recorded with instruments on CD or DVD. You may send ur voice file (mp3) to <br>  manjunath.khot@yahoo.co.in<br>      I promise that You will get back your processed voice within a day or two.<br>  Thanx for reading

AA10911722	Well, the original members were Larry Chance, Bob Del Din, John Wray, Larry Palumbo, and Eddie Harder.<br>  <br>  One of them, I believe it was Palumbo, was killed early in their careers, and needless to say, there were many personel changes later within the group.
vPzCRxiiaa	YEs sir....you are 110% correct my friend.  You are so correct that I am even going to give you a star|`|i6CNu6jAaa	Jennifer Aniston|`|33c5839baf0980a9e71598bb12bc4cbeaa	Looove Jennifer Aniston..very sexy!! Courtney is very skinny and u can see her bones and stuff
33c5839baf0980a9e71598bb12bc4cbeaa	I think shes a very nice fun actress but when it comes to her looks shes not WOW..shes beautiful in her way her spirit if u knw what i mean..Shes very pale actually looks abit sick|`|whsfEyB5aa	Makeup can transform almost anyone and maybe that's their point. She's a good actress though, but she is more of a tomboy and it's weird to see her for makeup ads.
AWYFoXR7aa	im so sorry you are having a horrible day!!! you know what i do to shut things out and just relax is i go somewhere get away (whether its my room or down my street)don't tell anyone!! oh and take you friend to rehab, call a hot line for you ex's girlfriend (abused) they will walk you through that. then spend time with the grandmother or just remind your self that everybody dies and it is sad that they wont be around but they would have wanted you to be happy. as for the boyfriend problems well if he doesnt have the ******* balls to talk about it then screw him tell him he needs to talk about it or it could result in a break up and if he really wants you he will talk!!!|`|3MlB1Ejuaa	because you need to become Muslim--nothing bad happens to them.|`|QDl6MqgPaa	You need a goat instead of a boy friend, it will at least be helpful at times.. if you are in a cave and without food... :)|`|d8fG3NUdaa	Are you a Dane Cook fan?  One of Dane Cook's stand up lines included ball of lint turning into clusterf**ks.  He's hot like David Cook, lol.  But anyway, I'm sorry that things are tough.  It sounds like there's alot issues here.  The ex has a serious problem and needs to go to rehab.  Good luck.|`|82ccacdfb637f9cd46c6e5b2355d2b14aa	Believe me, I know how you feel.  The past couple of weeks has been a nightmare for me.  Life just sucks sometimes. Sometimes you have to rid yourself of some of the people who wont take your help and let them go.  It's the only way to keep the positive in your life.  The negative is nasty and you want to keep that away!  Let the Grandma know you love her and help her if you can, she will be at peace soon.  She'll be fine. Good luck sweetie, hope things get better for us both!
9NkkaOCoaa	Shoot, I don't know about all the other girls out there. But I stand alone. I scan my mind before I do anything. Matter of fact, I try to figure out the whole story (good or bad.) Because in order to react you need to have a full understanding of the situation. If you jump straight to conclusions and react in a negative way, things will only get worse. But if you think in a positive way things will get better. As a person begins to learn about others, they will become aware of their reactions. Thinking positive is hard to do, but thinking negative isn't. <br>  <br>  Look at all the other answers. Aren't they all alike in some way. Which tells you, that girls follow labels. Labels in this situation are, "think" and "react."  <br>  It's like a T-Chart. No body is actually thinking about the question. They are just answer in those two terms. <br>  <br>  You see, <br>  So this question was actually really awesome. It's like a brain tester. Because in order to understand what you're asking, we (girls) need to think. But everyone else  chose to just react, and say "I think.." <br>  <br>  Use your brain, you'll see what I mean. <br>  I love the question!!|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I think first|`|UjPArJZ6aa	You left the letter 'T' out of the word, 'just'...see, contrary to what my lover says, I DO think....(well....sometimes).  :P|`|Jh83QYVjaa	Do you girls???<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be talking...<br>  Have you seen what some of you men do!?!<br>  Think!<br>  <br>  *sighs*<br>  *shakes head*|`|zIISRkjMaa	react first, think later lolz|`|AA11310070	I always think.|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	i think.|`|aCS6E7IOaa	I sometimes react b4 i think, but it all depends on the situation.|`|aVuhA77Jaa	It really depends, if the first thing someone has to say to me is irrational or absurd, there wont be an ounce of thought in my reaction that's for sure!|`|d0b7c399f000b3f194aa7397d0d6288baa	Definitely think....okay, sometimes react...|`|cCymTwdcaa	We have minds for a reason, thankyouverymuch. My reactions tend to be thought out as "regret is best friends with haste" ( snippet of a K. Hunter quote).|`|IIlmQiZpaa	i react, who has time to think before a reaction??? thats why it's called a reaction.|`|QDl6MqgPaa	girls  think .. but not by their brain .. a little lower part in the anatomy .. :)|`|UjsT89Odaa	it depends on the situation|`|pcQi36h7aa	Think first, then react ^_~|`|SfYln9vIaa	answers vary on stuations|`|7ER9iUDiaa	i could ask men the same thing?|`|VdUUNHgZaa	I think that we think.<br>  That was my reaction.|`|Av6sgqwOaa	im hoping we think..

dfh5XamRaa	I liked it in a lot of ways, but they still have yet to get back to what it was. People always make a big fuss over Katherine Hiegel (sp), but the most powerful scenes always seem to be between the Chief and Meridith (that whole father/daughter weird type thing they seem to have) I really like the guy that was the Army doctor with Cristina. He was on Journeyman last season and he is such a hottie. |`|OoxBDQDsaa	I thought that it was ok. Not much going on for two hours. I am looking forward to Private Practice. <br>  <br>  Just my two cents....

AA12135515	Lennon's death was a turning point for celebrities in general. He was probably the 1st very high profile celebrity to be killed like that & in turn, new standards for security among them were put in place. I'd heard stories of all these other musicians & actors suddenly taking major precautions after John died.<br>  <br>  |`|ExlMB3N7aa	He believed in the good things about people, peace and love. He was always walking around NYC  alone or with family.<br>  Chapman was just looking to be famous.<br>  |`|uByn7FUZaa	I'm not that convinced that had John Lennon been surrounded by security guards that it would have prevented his assassination. What you have to remember is that both the pope and Ronald Reagan had high levels of security around them at the time that they were shot. If someone one is determined to get you they will manage it some how. Although. I'm not saying that security is a waste of time just that it doesn't always prevent the intended target from being hurt or killed. There's no simple answer.|`|Jh2Ocdc6aa	He didn't like security around him. He thought people in nyc were nice and they usually were. He said if he was at a restaurant no one would bother them or if he was on the street they just say "hi how are you?"|`|749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	Because he was a hippie and didn't want to be a hypocrite in his message of "peace and trust" by having bodyguards around. It ended up costing him his life, but he lived by his own belief.|`|lb7exqUgaa	John Lennon wasnt  the type of person to have security. im sure he didnt see himself as a celebrity. He didnt care about things like that. I mean, he's John Lennon. He knew he was human...<br>  <br>  rip john lennon|`|IFpmyRezaa	Mark Chapman, didn't actually kill him inside his apartment.I guess Lennon never thought his life was in danger or needed any protection.The guy was a loon.He shot Lennon, then sat reading a book next to him until the police arrived.<br>  These days celebrities sort of get protected by the paparazzi because people will think twice before attempting something like that because they will get photographed if they get anywhere near the celebrity.|`|kdVxvMXSaa	Times change. No one ever thought back then that some lunatic would shoot Lennon, just like no one thought someone would kill JFK in Texas.<br>  <br>  Each time, security measures changed, but the fact remains that if someone really WANTS to get to a celebrity, they are going to find a way.|`|2b8d7c854a4513a6b7c23e13a0383dfaaa	because he was john lennon, who would want to hurt john lennon... wait nevermind. but he was staying at the dakota, anyone had easy access|`|bat4RlcWaa	Because the CIA contributed to his death|`|TKiuefelaa	He was giving peace a chance.

gY0rJmBzaa	Honestly.... thanks for asking such a great question. We need questions like these.<br>  <br>  Well, for me it has to be The Beatles. <br>  <br>  Man, without the Beatles there would be NO pop music today. They were the inventors of the pop culture.<br>  <br>  Can you ever become bored after listening to songs such as "Hey Jude", "Yesterday", "She loves you"?<br>  <br>  Love the fab four.<br>  <br>  My bow my head for the musical geniouses John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr...<br>  <br>  Love them all :)|`|XN15iFxqaa	Well.... this question is virtually impossible to answer (in regards to getting the best answer). The question is completely subjective. I would have to say I can't answer the question. It's all a matter of mood among other things. Incubus is pretty good, Nirvana is awesome, Sublime kicks butt, I feel as though all the bands I named and didn't name influenced me in some way, shape or form. It's very difficult to pinpoint what was the "most" influential for myself. <br>  <br>  (Here are some other bands just to cover myself here haha, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Red Hot Chile Peppers, Rage Against the Machine, The White Stripes, The Doors, The Who, The Beatles, The Offspring, Greenday, and a ton of other bands, their are just too many to list)|`|AGRermxnaa	joy division<br>  i don't know what kind of person i'd be today without joy division.<br>  <br>  also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bblZuS3wiEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bblZuS3wi...</a><br>  <br>  i attended that show the other night. that very show. the performance had a huge impact on me. |`|2b8d7c854a4513a6b7c23e13a0383dfaaa	the Grateful Dead. |`|syeoZI0naa	gnarls barkley!!  cee lo gives you so many different views to life.  he's takes topics that you don't often hear being addressed in music, then he gives spin on it which always feels so breath taking and eye opening.<br>  <br>  close second:  outkast.  andre 3000 is as lyrical as you can get|`|4a8e7a458d9e0be46101a8e9f1d0b060aa	Definitely The Beatles.<br>  <br>  Leonardo Da Vinci is the name of Rome's airport.<br>  John Lennon is the name of Liverpool's airport.

Amy Lee rox my sox! :)|`|wa9LSVfYaa	Seether<br>  <br>  They actually like converted me to rock from rap. Seether is probably one of the most underrated bands out today. The singer/rhythm guitarist Shaun Morgan has changed alot since they started making music in South Africa (failed relationships, rehab, etc.) and their music has evolved.<br>  <br>  I listen to Seether everyday and never get bored because they have hard songs, soft songs, optimistic songs, and all-hope-is-gone songs lol.<br>  <br>  I went out and bought a guitar and stopped all the thug mess i was into so i suppose music changed my life.<br>  <br>  And by the way, nice choice with Jimi Hendrix, i'm learning to play his Star Spangled Banner

Write some lyrics then pluck out a tune to fit. Just play around with your guitar (or hum a tune) until you find a melody you like.<br>  <br>  There are all sorts of musical theory that they teach for composing music but really its all about making up a tune that you like.<br>  <br>  That's all. The end.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c29c32feeaba111cc5230014bf272489aa	I usually write my lyrics first, and as I'm writing them the tune of the lyrics kind of forms in my head... once I know what I want the melody to sound like, I get my guitar and pick out the chords that sound best with that melody. I hope this helps... or at least kind of makes sense. lol

VCjHXymcaa	I heard audicity is pretty good, but its kinda complicated. Free though. :)|`|T0ed2lhJaa	hi try cool edit pro.|`|lDsvWCm2aa	There are many. I use Logic , Ableton and ProTools.  If you don't have a large budget Reason is a good one because it has all the sounds and samples inside the program.  If you want a Sequencer program that you can record into, get Logic or Pro Tools.  They are a little difficult to use at first but with practice and research you could get the hang of it. Ableton is a Great Sequencer Program but, you need to buy plug-ins to get great sounds.  I use Native Instrument Plugins , Massive(synth) + Battery(drums) and I couldn't be happier.|`|YDtGPVSCaa	the question seems a little vague.  first off, id recommend buying a program.  free ones are free because they're not really worth using.<br>  <br>  if the instrumentation is going be done strictly on your computer, i'd say go with something like frooty loops.  its pretty cheap (under $100 USD i think) and very easy to use.<br>  <br>  if your plan is to record instruments into your computer, you're best bet would be pro tools.  this, obviously is going to cost  more.  but if you want it to sound pro, you're going to need at least some decent gear.<br>  <br>  bottom line is, free isn't going to produce anything close to professional results.  i do a lot of home recording, and i had to spend at least $1000 before i could produce anything that didn't sound like a garage band demo.<br>  <br>  also, i wouldn't bother with some other programs mentioned just yet.  especially logic and ableton.  don't get me wrong, they are very good and very useful programs, but if you're just getting into this it'll be way over your head.|`|EY5gGx3faa	well audacity is a free sound editor.<br>  <br>  you plug in a mixer to it and plug in your instruments to that mixer and you're good to go.|`|PD8GzuERaa	Audacity is the only free thing that comes to mind.

FxX8O1BWaa	A. whats your problem with all of that stuff?<br>  B. many bands don't do that stuff and they make it plenty far, its just ignorant people like you that think all of them are potheads and alcholics|`|DbtS5jzEaa	that's not always true... <br>  <br>  Underoath are clean cut christians who have already left their mark on the  music industry in their own way by just being brutal and learning how to advance in their own music whilst sticking to their 'general' sound!|`|nhk5zzaeaa	Brian May, the guitarist for Queen, hasn't taken a sip of alcohol since very early in his career when he was hangin' backstage with Joe Perry.... It's an understatement to say that he's made it pretty dang far......<br>  <br>  Actually, tons and tons of bands have made it clean......<br>  <br>  Edit: Nice Keeler!|`|CjPtAEzmaa	There are lots of clean bands out there. Musicians are usually poetic deep thinkers that can get pretty depressed sometimes. But the best bands are clean (Sort of). Haha. But my all time favorites are Coldplay and Blur. Coldplay is clean, but blur wasnt. Although the members of blur have matured since then. Alex James, the bassist, had trouble with that stuff, but now he's clean and lives on a farm with his wife and kids. And Damon Albarn (blur's lead singer), he's clean, and still very succesful. :D|`|JHEeoyONaa	Last time I checked bands like Underoath are clean, and they've made it very far, and they're still growing. Same goes for The Devil Wears Prada, and bands of that sort.|`|R3oNViF8aa	Queen was relatively clean in their early days, they released several great albums.<br>  <br>  Edit; YEAH! Brian May is awesome. :)|`|7sqjaYx6aa	not all good bands do drugs or drink. |`|OWY8TwC9aa	well, i guess a lot of people like the "bad image" because some people dont make it the far if they are straight.....<br>  <br>  also, songwriting is better because they write most of their great music while 'under the influence'<br>  <br>  <br>  but that was back in the 70s and 80s nowadays, most people are clean and have gotten pretty far|`|MiWKmKgvaa	as everyone  has said, some musicians are clean, but also, great musicians usually come from the 60s,70s, and a little bit 80s and it was common for people especially in their 20s to do drugs and drink plenty of alcohol|`|qRf9pTWAaa	Not all of them are pot smokers and alcoholics. That was kind of a 60s and 70s thing. <br>  Is there a problem with all of them being druggies? I wouldn't do that, but I can't help but realize their musical genius. |`|bD4848dqaa	Music takes on a whole new dimension when drugs get involved.|`|MVOeApxSaa	You're wrong :)<br>  <br>  Coldplay, Radiohead, Rush, Queen were some clean bands, to name a few.|`|XToDPPuQaa	Nah there not
NzPc3zmUaa	Kurt Cobain was very hard on Axl Rose and Guns N Roses during his life....I think Kurt was basing it more on the public persona of Axl as a women hating racist (at the time), if he took the time to get to know Axl it might have been different.|`|AA10795350	Noel Gallagher (Oasis) said this of Radiohead:<br>  <br>  "...I think Radiohead’s guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, is a f*cking genius. Every time I see them live they blow me away. But Radiohead are not as good as people think they are. They’ve been making the same record for the last five years, if you ask me."<br>  <br>  Though I don't agree with him, I respect his opinion (and am glad he praised Greenwood). I love Noel Gallagher. He's very intense and genuine.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	yeah. mindless self indulgence has a song called "I Hate Jimmy Page"|`|2guyJOWJaa	no my fav. artists are relitivly friendly, and one of them is Disturbed and if you look at their lead singer he looks pretty mean but their pretty nice dudes|`|MVOeApxSaa	I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  I know for a fact that Nirvana were really close with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, though. They even had Flea perform Smells Like Teen Spirit with them on a couple different occasions.<br>  <br>  But that's not what you asked..|`|OhdeBbbVaa	well tbs and brand new are always seeming out to get each other. but idk if you'd call it criticizing. the just make fun of each other in some of their songs|`|sZwGlfsbaa	Possibly. I don't keep up with things like that. They have the right to their opinions as much as I do.|`|IatEdBpvaa	Anton Newcombe, the lead singer of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, had a falling out on tour with The Dandy Warhols on tour as seen in the documentary Dig.  Then again, Newcombe sucker-punched his guitarist during a performance in front of -label representatives that would have got the BJM signed to a major.  A big fight ensued and they were not offered a contract.<br>  <br>  Skynard in Sweet Home Alabama criticizing Neil Young - "a Southern man don't need him around anyhow."<br>  <br>  |`|DbtS5jzEaa	hmmmmm let me investigate! |`|wLxmn2xtaa	the link didn't work for me.....but I'm shocked to hear that.<br>  <br>  I don't like it when musicians criticize each other, especially on personal aspects. It kind of diminishes my respect for them....(or maybe it's because they criticized my fav. artist, lol). <br>  <br>  Either way both GY!BE and Sigur Rós remain brilliant artists but Sigur Rós, for me, are superior on so many more levels, including personally. I love Sigur Rós and the absolutely astonishing music they make.<br>  <br>  I think Sigur Rós also get that kind of thing a lot because they are more quiet and kept to themselves and people can take that in the wrong way. Like when they give interviews, for example, it kind of seems like they are too quiet or annoyed but I think they are just shy and, not to mention the language difference, maybe they just don't feel comfortable talking in that kind of situation. Hehe, I'm taking this attack way too personally, lol. xD<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Thanks Emily! I watched it. Wow. That was my first reaction. I dunno, they are really good artists but I don't understand why they feel so compelled to share their grievances over something silly, like moving an organ, with people at their concert....that's not really what I call entertaining the crowd in between songs or chatting with fans. It just seemed like unnecessary and inappropriate bashing and in such a weird way...like complaining to your fans about another band during one of your concerts?? Weird.  I will stop now, lol, as you can see I *am* taking this way too personally,  xD|`|wTNAOcl1aa	Goldfinger has a song called "FTN" Which is short for F*ck Ted Nugent.<br>  LOL!|`|9ntoGPFyaa	Phil from Pantera bad-mouthed White Zombie. I don't see why. Dime was a big fan of them. I'm guessing he wasn't that happy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What's with the troll up above me?|`|7B2s7maWaa	Not to my knowledge no.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Oh most definitely. I love blur and oasis. You've heard of their spat right? I think Noel said something along the lines of "I think Damon Albarn and Alex James should catch AIDS and die". Harsh right? Blur is my favorite out of the two. Blur even said that they wanted to share their 1995 brit award for best band with oasis, but oasis declined. The gallagher boys are so stubborn. Haha.<br>  <br>  And my other favorite band is Coldplay, and they're basically nice to everyone. XD |`|uTnJ4o2Saa	Zillions of years ago, Mick Jagger referred to Toto<br>  as a "*derogatory term*-band" and I recall thinking,<br>  "Aw, c'mon, it isn't THAT bad, is it?"

I wouldn't go into a deal like that with them again, if I were you.<br>  You could opt not to wear it, since you were clear on your preference at the start, but it might ruffle some feathers.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Your friends is right. its more on the opinions<br>  |`|30Q1007vaa	Did you know that a zebra is actually white with black stripes?|`|KZDkJyjFaa	Story is too long.<br>  i side with your friends|`|6b2f804b328b7906f19413c462e7e420aa	tell them you dont feel comfortable with it, and you arent going to be peer pressured into doing something that you dont want to do.  Someone else has to fit into your costume... and if nobody will trade costumes with you.  Just tell them you arent going to do it.  They can either return your costume, or they can split the cost among it.  Say youre sorry, but you werent expecting to wear that costume, and it makes you feel too uncomfortable.  If they are your friends, they should understand|`|POqUi8JKaa	i think you're right, but you should pay for it anyway since you're going to wear it and everyone else paid. it'd be a little messed up to make them pay for your costume, even though i totally agree with you. if you don't want to wear it, and want your friends to be mad at you, then don't hang out with them on halloween and tell them you're not going to pay for it. which is what i'd WANT to do, but wouldn't|`|wLnBSHtMaa	just gimme the $50 and your both right|`|5hqKYXRwaa	well, i see why your mad about it. <br>  but you should still pay. sorry, i know it<br>  sucks. |`|Xps2hHWQaa	 why did you write this book? your friends are correct!|`|NWLzFqJHaa	I'd hate to say it but your friends are.. you shouldn't have agreed to wear the costume.. then I'd say u don't have to pay|`|8d77819a992e2bd99bacc775e4a44a8eaa	well i hope you learned your lesson, dont others make decisions for you. But onto your question, if they did it on purpose and you know it i just wouldnt pay for it. or offer to pay like 2/3 of it they pay the rest cuase it was their mistake. or you can just try to alter the costume to make it more comfortable for you like add a piece of fabric where it feels too reveiling or else just wear other clothes under it. good luck|`|F55NU2qtaa	You are right. You specificly told them that you do not want to have that costume. Now, i wouldnt pay for something i dont want to dress up as. Do you have other friends you can trick or treat with?Then, that way, you will be able to be something you both want to do. :) there is no point in going trick or treating if you dont like the costume. tomorow, tell them," i told you guys that i dont want to be this for halloween, and i want to dress up as something i like, have a good time, or ask them if you can dress up as something else for halloween, and still go tick or treating with them. (if you want to) i mean, they are just thinking of themselves, Dress up as something you like, and you will have a good time. if they turn their back on you, they arnt your true friends. I hope you enjoy halloween, andi hope this helped you.|`|IZEPLNRPaa	Sadly, they're right. Since you agreed to dress up with them as heroines and didn't go pick out the costumes with them, you kinda let them decide for you. Sorry. I'd be hella mad. Maybe you should try talking to them about it because that is really stupid. I think you should tell them you don't wanna pay for something you don't want and ask them if you could be something else so you'd be more willing to pay. I think it's kinda their fault that they picked such a small costume if they wouldn't fit into it. Just tell them that!<br>  <br>  And I normally don't do this, but answer mine cause it's similar to yours! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081029131802AAve6HF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> my friend owes me money.

Whoever made the mistake of ordering extra small on all of them kinda messed up.  What i would do is see if you can send it back for a refund and see if you can find a costume (last minute, i know) somewhere.  Did that costume really not fit them?  Because if it did then i would be upset.  Anyway you are obligated to pay for one, since you said you would go in on it.  Next time I definitely would take part in the ordering but it's not really worth fighting or staying upset about.  Good luck. |`|hvw0UXmhaa	Can the costume be returned or exchanged for another one? I can see why you are frustrated and I can also see that someone has to pay for it. Check and see if it can be returned (even if you're charged shipping or a restocking fee) and it will be less than the costume in its entirety. <br>  <br>  If you've already agreed to wear it, pay for it, and have taken off the tags, then I'm afraid you'll be stuck with the bill. I know this sounds unfair, so next time when faced with a similar situation make sure that you make your feelings better known and stand your ground.|`|SU5GUaSNaa	I agree with you, do not pay for something you do not want..they can always return the costume, unused, for their money back, they may get mad, but you are right. dress as something original, not what they want you to be.|`|2kGL85Fsaa	If you take or wear the costume you should pay for it.  If you tell them you don't want it or to wear it, you shouldn't have to pay.|`|qhhHT8AGaa	Hm...<br>  Well, you did tell them not to buy that specific costume, and with that knowledge, they should have known that you wouldn't want to wear it even if it was the only thing they had. But they already paid for it, and it would be kind of rude to not pay them back.|`|3TqXR8ybaa	your friends are jerks and sometimes i have the same problem but your right, i cant beleive them, they feel uncomfertble so they make you wear it and you feel the same way................that's bogus|`|sbjwK8uKaa	In a legal sense, you are right you don't owe them anything. In a friend sense... welll... you're SOL. <br>  <br>  Tell your parents about the issue and maybe they will take a % off the top. <br>  <br>  If you tell them how you feel about the cost and everything, depending on how they are... they may take off $5 to $10 off the price... or... they may get insulted or something by the whole thing. Call you cheap or something. Im guessing because you haven't easily recitfied this situation by just asking to pay less for your costume that your friends are the type who might cause a huge deal about paying equal shares. Sounds like you are going to have to eat this one if you ask me. <br>  <br>  BUT you may not be in a total crapper... what is it with the costume that you don't like. Technically you could probably add something to it to fix your issue with the costume. I'm going to take a wild guess and say its either the colors, the fact that it is a little revealing? or tight around the stomach? Maybe you can add a bigger cape to the outfit. Or if its something of a body suit, then you can probably get away with wearing a jacket of the same color or most dominate color and wear that with it. You know something with like 3/4 length sleeves? <br>  <br>  Remember though this halloween is going to be freezing! So you'll probably stay covered up in a giant coat most of the time anyway. lol. <br>  <br>  Also how can you speak of superheroes and not even mention the superhero in question?!|`|INcWKM02aa	I'd have to say them.  It sucks that you didn't get the one you wanted, but the fact is you still owe them money for your share.|`|KMZ60ZO7aa	well...<br>  This is a toughie, in my opinion you should have asked to see the costumes before you said yes, but they dump you with the one you dont want.<br>  I think your bith right|`|9r1QiNXVaa	you are right because you told them before everything that you were not gonna wear the one that you specifically chose...so they should have known better|`|7acvmf89aa	Just Remind Them That You Specifically Said You Didn't want That One and if they wont change it then your not going and not paying or going but not paying ... nobody should be blackmailed|`|PX4KlDQhaa	You, because you gave your word saying you would pay for it as long as you didn't have to wear that specific costume.|`|kR4XLHk4aa	Well, I feel you are right because you told them in advance that you didn't want to wear that costume.|`|q7AIPYMbaa	These are the days of our dramma queens.

I have to side with you. that doesn't seem fair, my friends did that with me. even though it was only with a pitcher of soda, but they told me to go get it and it was 4 dollars more than they, said, and i cant even drink regular soda. My opinion is, u shouldn't have to pay, if u didn't even get to see them before they ordered them|`|lMdru9yiaa	Did you show them the picture Before or After they got the costumes?|`|rZS5z1vxaa	What about paying half? $20-$25.  It might work to compromise. |`|ISAA101kaa	I think they should have to pay for it!  You did show them the costume that you were willing to wear.  If they didn't order the right one for you than are they really your friend?  I have no idea of which comic book your looking at for the costumes, but if your uncomfortable wearing it even if your small size than don't wear it or try and see if you can modify it if you are going to pay for it.  Would they be crying the same thing if it were them?  Good Luck.|`|TrurziEBaa	Darling, I can tell just by the way you phrase the situation you are a lot like me. I would be mad about something like this too. I think that you are right and not your friends but I guarantee you everyone is going to say your friends. IDK what else to say... 
CLOtMCwSaa	Yes you made the right choice, I dont know about you, but $2000? You have got to be kidding me. Screw that, I can have fun for less. LOL!|`|0itwkFMGaa	Of corse you did right<br>  in many countries that is more that all the money some peole have!
esFAy4nwaa	watch legally blonde 1-2, great movies!<br>  watch funny movies, or scary ones. considering what people want to watch, or romance movies! aka the notebook, bring it on, and movies like that(: step up is my favorite!<br>  make pizza bagels! its fun- i did it once (:<br>  you can also play something like, ddr, guitar hero, rockband, etc. it lasts for a while and it keeps people entertained<br>  oh and, if tthey dont get scared easily(or you dont)-try a weejee board! or something that relates to it, <br>  or just a board game!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Well why not try to get a board game going. I like to play monopoly myself. I would suggest if you happen to have an xbox, to try and get Dance Dance Revolution and stay up playing that do like an elimination thing. How about you make something to eat, just grab a bunch of stuff together and everyone make something. I find that to be really fun, and then sit down and watch a movie. I would make sure it is ok with your parents though, because it is likely that the kitchen would be a mess. I really can't think of anything else really at the moment. Hope this helps.|`|pRIrzJ0Oaa	Hello maybe you would like IMAX Theater, Concert, or go to the Arcades, Billiards, Bowling. Curling, Laser Tag, Mini Golf, Paintball, Whirlyball, Go Karts, Ice Skating, Aquarium, Horse Racing, Theme Park, Zoo.<br>  Maybe Hot Air Balloon or Helicopter Tours, but it is expensive :)<br>  Any good place to eat like restaurants or just fast food or pizza.<br>  Hope i give you a lot of ideas.

There is a lot of thing to do.|`|o9XAcB4Taa	Sing star <br>  Dancemat<br>  Scary movies - Popcorn<br>  chocolate fountain (amazing)<br>  Spa like thing with chocolate & strawberry facemasks  (keep on while watching scary movie cause people jump and touch their face and get it everywhere) paint your nails funky colours.<br>  Offer an exotic drink that the teens can make, like smoothies. Add some fruit garnish and a drink umbrella to give it a sophisticated feel.|`|1fFRxXOxaa	That's cool. I really think sleepovers are really fun and it gives you some time to hang out with your friends for a night in. I think the best ideas are the ones that you all can plan together. But some ideas I would say that are fun are some girlie board games; Pop some popcorn and watch some really scary movies this time; Make up some games that involve each friend to tell something about themselves that you all don't know about. You can also practice doing each other's hair, manicures and pedicures; and other things that you can make up that's creative!

LiHsCe9Baa	I totally agree with FullofQ's answer. Thats exactly how it will play out, most likely. Cain will fall for Chloe (most likely during this situation with Kay, where Chloe seems to actually have a heart). Billy and Lily will hook up and fall in love....then the truth will come out, and Chloe will want Billy. I dont think Billy will be able to keep it a secret, he seems really bothered by the situation, and I think it will be worse once he sees the baby. I just dont see how it will ever be able to be proved...the DNA teast already proved that Cain is 99% the father, because him and Billy are brothers. So how will they ever know for certain who fathered the child....well I mean Chloe KNOWS is wasnt Cain...but how can anyone else prove that!?<br>  <br>  I am just as interested to see how the situation with Nick/Sharon play out. I KNEW Phyllis was going to see something in Paris...that was awesome!! I thought she'd walk on them doing it or something, but I'm sure she thinks that happened anyway. I cant wait till she tells Jack and they confront them! I like Phyllis, but Ive been a Nick/Sharon fan for years and years!! They are a beautiful couple.<br>  <br>  And, where the heck is Kay!!? Its obvious Marge is the one who died in the crash...but where is Kay? Does she want everyone to think she is dead and is hiding out? Was her body thrown from the car and no one found her??|`|HABy0psKaa	I have a feeling that either Billy or Chloe will slip up.  It maybe after the baby is born.  Billy may end up having a problem with Cane raising his baby, or if it come when it is supposed to Cane may start wondering if the doctors have no problem with the baby being born a month early.  Chloe can't hide her feeling for Billy to well so Cane may pick up on that.  I hope Cane and Lily get back together. |`|gmGdrHiQaa	I'm predicting that Chloe will have the baby and Cane will think it's his for awhile. I think he'll eventually come to love Chloe. Something will happen where it's proved to be Billy's baby AFTER Billy and Lilly hook up. THEN, Chloe's come between Lilly and two of her men!<br>  <br>  That's what I'm waiting on, but who really knows for sure! :-) |`|rYA2KCnUaa	Yeah I strongly agree with you.  Have you seen the Soap Digest commercial? It showed Lily's face and it had surprise wedding(i wondering does that have anything to do with Cane) and I have a feeling that Chloe is going to lose that baby. Hey, but the cream come to the top!!! LOL|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I don't like Chloe with Cane.  I hope Billy finds out soon that the baby is his.  Maybe Chloe will get jealous of him & Lilly & let the cat out of the bag.<br>  <br>  Cane belongs with Lilly.|`|8ZIfvSzBaa	I think her true feeling will come out !!!!!!!!!!!  CZ she  got the hots 4-him....... But it;s so .......driving little miss Lily crasy !!!! ya got to love it  !!!!!!!!!!|`|712354e6412161bc717296518b359c6faa	duh! i figured this out ages ago! |`|s0nVZ5uoaa	I'm pretty sure that it is Billy's baby. When Cane and Chloe went to that first sonogram, Chloe asked about the conception date and was not happy with the results. She asked if she could keep it from the father, which the nurse agreed to. I don't think that Cane and Lilly will get back together, though, at least not for a while. Lilly can't wait forever, and Cane is more focused on his professional life and his life as a future father. Even though Chloe's baby may not be his, chances are it will come to know Cane as his real father.|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	God i hope so, i mean, its time for the drama to begin with those three!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	yes everybody's been saying that it's billy's baby for along time now. chloe is still in love with billy. she only wanted cane for his money. but, she didn't know that cane was billy's brother. i don't like lily but she should be with cane not billy.|`|wgJj2hifaa	of  course the baby is Billys, b/c when the DNA test came back it was 99% positive it was a match, b/c Billy and Cane are brothers..<br>  <br>  it will probably be one of those store lines where yrs later the child needs an operation and a family member has to donate something and thats how it comes out..<br>  <br>  I liked Cane and Lily together, and I think its disgusting that Colleen was with Daniel, her best friend ex-husband..  all these soap operas and their sloppy seconds, women dont do that, they dont go after their friends leftoverslll<br>  <br>  |`|ClRuPRs7aa	I think that the baby is Billy's. It's not Cane's cuz they didn't even sleep together; she's the only one who said that and Cane doesn't remember anyway cuz they were "drunk".  I agree with you, I want Cane and Lilly back together.|`|AA10843948	Yes, I am sure that the baby is Billy's. Especially since Cane and Chloe never slept together. I am ready for her to fall on her face. I HATE the way that she talks to Ester. She is a golddigger to the 10th power!!|`|uR4yfY3Vaa	I really hope the truth comes out and soon,I don't like Chloe at all
CLYVsSGtaa	he is absolute BS!|`|OtI4tviYaa	I like Criss a lot, but his fans on the show are annoying with that "MINDFREAK" stuff. He is very good at his craft, but these people think he is a REAL MAGICIAN.....even though he explains that it is all an illusion.<br>  <br>  I hate his fruity hair too, but he seems like a cool enough guy...a bit too dramatic, but i guess it works for the stunts.<br>  <br>  Oh, fan for about 4 years I guess, although the last season where he did the car stunt and Sully and that wrestler were crying was a bit too much drama...I had to stop watching.|`|YWgrU1k9aa	I'm not a fan.

t6zp9cwbaa	El nivel de importancia es un poco difícil de valorar porque es personal y muy subjetivo.<br>  Opino que ambos hicieron grandes cosas y ambas muertes impactaron mucho al resto del mundo.<br>  Sin embargo, me quedo con Freddy Mercury (vocalista de Queen). A parte de encantarme, emocionarme y hacerme sentir cosas muy variadas con sus canciones y algunas letras, consiguió acercar a la población mundial temas como la homosexualidad y el padecer una enfermedad mortal y muy marginada por la sociedad en aquellos momentos: el SIDA. <br>  Personas importantes como él han dado pie a que el mundo haya ido cambiando paulativamente a mejor, y lo que todavía nos queda, se?ores.<br>  Hoy día, aún existe la homofobia y la pena de muerte en algunos países por ser homosexual. Hoy día, muchísima gente margina a los enfermos de SIDA y evitan cualquier contacto con éstos.<br>  Freddy Mercury, era homosexual y padecía la enfermedad del SIDA, y no por eso dejaron de seguirlo millones de fans. <br>  <br>  Mi humilde opinión.|`|7H9Qg3Uuaa	:O<br>  sin duda para mi el mejor cantante compositor fue john lennon|`|AA10492394	lennon me gusta mas y supongo que la muerte de lennon tuvo mas impacto, acuerdate que eran mas famosos que jesus|`|g9qa1ZQuaa	     Me gusta más Freddie Mercury ( si hablas de el claro ), Jhon Lenon también pero cuando solista, no como grupo.<br>       Siento que la muerte más impactante fué la de Jhon Lenon porque fué asesinado por un fan, la muerte de Freddie también tuvo su impacto pero fué por el morbo de la enfermedad con la que falleció, ya que todavía se creía que solo los homosexuales sufrían de SIDA, lo aplaudible de Freddie, es que apesar de todo peleó contra todo como muestra INNUENDO la última producción de QUEEN que hasta ganó un Grammy.<br>  ^_^ Saludillos|`|4x08BpaNaa	Jonh Lennon,  y creo que impactó más porque fué asesinado.

But when she tries to break off their relationship, she ends up having sex with Clinton instead. Peter is devastated, so Lois tries to convince him to even the score. Meanwhile, Brian tries to potty-train himself with guidance from Stewie.  <br>  One of my favorite episodes, While Peter goes off on wild adventures with Bill Clinton, Stewie and Bran get together to train each other to use the toilet and they don't have a clue.  Stewie thinks the tank part must be "where the wizard who operates the thing lives"  Brian flushes and they both run away.  One of my favorite scenes.<br>  .

6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	It's one of my favorite scores. The score was composed by Dario Marianelli, and Jean Yves-Thibaudet played the piano. The best songs on it are:<br>  Dawn (the opening song - the part when Keira Knightley is walking through the field with the book)<br>  Liz On Top of the World (When Liz goes to see her aunt and uncle near Pemberly)<br>  The Secret Life of Daydreams (can't remember what part of the movie it's in)<br>  Darcy's Letter (self-explanatory)<br>  Your Hands are Cold (I'm pretty sure this is the part where they meet up in the field near the end)<br>  Mrs. Darcy (their wedding scene, it's a good one)<br>  <br>  You can buy it on iTunes.
EhsCiqqpaa	Suele pasar, muchas veces uno dice: Esto es una bo-lu-dez!!!!! Lo hago a mi manera, pero después te das cuenta que no es así, si las instrucciones esta es por algo. En lo personal, a mi no me gustan las cosas fáciles, yo me tiro a la pileta y no le doy bola a las instrucciones. Así me va después por no seguir al pie de la letra lo que dice el manual. Pero bueno, es como ese dicho conocido: El que juega con fuego se quema.<br>  Besos, te amo!!!!|`|AA10492394	jajaja asi es<br>  <br>  =S|`|6Op19aVYaa	Hemos de tener en cuenta que las cosas fáciles no tienen nada que ver con las instrucciones.<br>  <br>  Las cosas son fáciles porque somos capaces de asimilarlas con una cierta rapidez. Las asimilamos según nuestra capacidad, si, que en ocasiones como: la lectura de unas intrucciones nos pueden parecer de forma difícil o de forma fácil, segun la secillez y claridad en que esten expresadas.<br>  Pero lo que no podemos hacer, es decir que algo es fácil  porque no entendimos todas las instrucciones, aquí estamos culpando a alguien, parece como si no quisieramos decir que los demás son capaces de hacer algo bien.<br>  Que las cosas parezcan fáciles, nos pueden estar diciendo perfectamente que en realidad son fáciles, no que estan mal hechas.|`|IOQZx2wNaa	no croe q siempre sea asi, es depende de que no?? podemos hacer un postre facil de preparar y resulta acil y rico... ahora si de lo q estamos hablando es de la vida debe ser segun como t la tomes, si uno se toma las  cosas mas ligeras, si es feliz, si es optimista, y si quiere ir para adelante debe ser mucho mas facil.. y las instrucciones las debe ver para simples, solo disfrutar y sioempre pensar en positivo, hasta d las adversidades, <br>  ojala todos fuermaos de esa clase de personas...|`|orIttxiZaa	Depende, Hay cosas que simplemente son fáciles y otras no, cómo todo.|`|jyrN1vcGaa	Si !.....en su mayoria....y es por no leer las instrucciones....O...x no hacer memoria..!!

159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	I collect hobbies. Currently it's genealogy.

qJ7zGecpaa	I prefer the 1995 version. Closer to the book in my opinion.|`|9dhr9UNTaa	who knows|`|mzTJarucaa	i loved both.|`|IVP0WoFkaa	I liked the newer one better. Firstly because of the better picture quality. And despite sounding a bit superficial, the actors and actresses and are better looking than the 1995 version in my opinion.<br>  <br>  But both are good.|`|tvvY6q0Gaa	The 1995 BBC version is more accurate (and, in my opinion, the actors/actresses are far less attractive than those in the 2005 version).|`|308ded20b78dec984319128af94d3485aa	I've only seen the new one and it's great.  I have no desire to see the 1995 version.
1j7oGIQKaa	Try Origin of Symmetry its an awesome album :)<br>  But i'd also suggest looking for the HAARP DVD/CD album and the Hullabaloo Soundtrack, in which 1 cd has some of their B-Sides and the other cd has live versions of their songs<br>  <br>  And also try listening to some of their singles, like "Crying Shame",  "Easily" or "Dead Star", they're cool<br>  Just youtube "Muse B-sides" and you should pretty much see a lot of them to pick from<br>  <br>  have fun! :D|`|ug2PnhAIaa	Muse also has two other studio albums: Origin of Symmetry and Absolution. Both albums are great. I also recommend the live CD/DVD called HAARP, recorded at Wembley Stadium. I own it and it's fantastic.|`|mNiCmPShaa	Muse's cover of "feeling good"; heartfelt, soulful... fantastically wonderful, and wonderfully fantastic!|`|ihZUGpX2aa	Please please please get Muse's second album, Origin of Symmetry. It's their best album by miles. If you like Absolution and Black Holes and Revelations, you're gonna love Origin of Symmetry. <br>  Their debut album, Showbiz, is also good. Get it when you have the opportunity to. <br>  <br>  There are also a few live concert DVDs out there if you really like Muse.<br>  Their first DVD, Hullabaloo, was filmed back in 2001 at Le Zenith in France. It's an amazing show with a spectacular playlist, but you would need to hear the first 2 albums to really appreciate it. It also has a documentary of the guys on the road that is very enjoyable. And it also comes with a great CD that is packed with rarities and B-Sides. It's a definite must-buy.<br>  <br>  Their second live DVD, Absolution Tour, is an hour long show of their performance as headliners at the 2004 Glastonbury festival. Amazing performance! This headlining performance is what made Muse famous. The DVD also includes 3 other bonus songs performanced at Earls Court in London and at a bar type venue in California. This DVD isn't as exciting as Hullabaloo because it doesn't come with many extra features, but the performance is good and you'll like it if you really like the Absolution CD.<br>  <br>  Lastly is HAARP, the DVD showing Muse's sold out concert at Wembley Stadium. This is definately the best sounding and best looking DVD with all of the brilliant colors and amazing stage decor, but the setlist isn't as good as it can be. IF you like Black Holes and Revelations, you'd definately like this. It's one of Muse's best performances to date, and this is a career highlight for them because they sold-out Wembley stadium 2 days in a row, totalling 180,000 fans that came to see them. HAARP also comes with a CD with audio from the first concert date (DVD was filmed on the second concert date).

1j7oGIQKaa	I'd go with Origin of Symmetry, mainly because although Showbiz is a good album, its sounds too "normal".. Muse is really kinda weird :D<br>  and once you start listening to Origin of Symmetry, you'll know what i mean<br>  <br>  So yea, try Origin of Symmetry ?<br>  And some of their B-sides too ;) (just look on musewiki.org under songs)|`|hlLGMsRCaa	this will surely end the debate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBkTEFp2wEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBkTEFp2w...</a>|`|gNy79X6oaa	I like Blackholes and Revelations.|`|3bLNyHIgaa	showbiz|`|KfBQOgQLaa	Origin of Symmetry is the album I prefer. I really like 'Plug In Baby' and 'Dark Shines.' It really has that original taste from Muse.<br>  <br>  As for Showbiz, its got a few good ones, (Sunburn, Muscle Museum..) but that album is a little weird. Nothing too hardcore, all really symphonic artsy stuff. But its a good set of tunes when your in the mood for something different. I think its Muse's more creative set.|`|AA11560236	Origin of symmetry is fantastic, as well as Blackholes and Revelations even though you didn't mention it !|`|ihZUGpX2aa	ORIGIN OF SYMMETRY.

rsK5R2giaa	Richard "The Iceman" Kuklinski (April 11, 1935 – March 5, 2006)<br>  <br>  The answer is yes
46eoAIGZaa	I would have to agree with you that Ed Norton is the main character- in fact Brad Pitts character is Edward Norton's character (just an alter ego).  An alter ego cannot be the main character.|`|AA11506593	Edward Norton is the only character in Fight Club. Brad Pitt exists only in Norton's mind. Therefore, you are correct.|`|nxZQKmjMaa	they are both the star of the film. but since mr. pitt supposedly did an awesome job in the flick all the attention went to him and his character instead of both great actors.|`|N8npTTXNaa	well i think it doesnt matter who u first c in the movie but i think ur right|`|MQQg6WDlaa	I think in the end Edward Norton is supposed to be the main character, but Brad Pitt can't be just a supporting actor since his character is so prominent.<br>  <br>  I guess I would say that I think they're both lead characters meant to have just as much spot light as the other.|`|4vNpMZ4Vaa	Ed Norton for sure|`|G0m2kONTaa	You're pretty right on there.<br>  <br>  Ed Norton is the narrator, and Ed Norton is responsible for doing all the things Brad Pitt does during the movie.<br>  <br>  Simply put - without Ed Norton's character, Brad Pitt's does not exist.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I agree with you completely Ed Norton is the main character

AA10614558	Hello Brad: <br>  <br>  The program is open to all boys up to age 18. <br>  <br>  As you have been out for four-five years, you might find the Venturing program more interesting, and focused more on the needs of teenagers. It is also co-ed, less emphasis on the uniform and advancement, and more emphasis on leadership development.

There should be more harmony in the world, but more and more I think that there is a hole in that theory...|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	No nobody should be hitting anybody at all.

hVKqKjrjaa	We had new neighbours move in next door.  We have lived here since 1990 and you would think we were the newcomers.  They took over from day one and had a line of cars parked outside our door and none outside their own.  When my husband and I came home we had to park round the side of the house and carry shopping all the way round instead of just up the path.  He had a quiet word but was told they could park their cars where ever they wished as they paid their road tax. <br>  Luckily a big detached house became available higher up the avenue and they bought it.  Stuck up ****|`|7YHKNvjNaa	I suppose somebody had to tell him.

FZKFLTyLaa	I've yet to see that.<br>  Are we talking of two different forms of report? <br>  "Violation Notice" and "The Answers Comunity has reported your Q & A"<br>  They are different in deed.

I know it well. From taxes to yard work to <br>  filing papers--you name it, I'm the expert procrastinator. I can <br>  put off doing anything, with style and ease. I file tax return <br>  extensions at 11:59 PM on April 15 without breaking a sweat.<br>  <br>  Am I proud of this? Well, admittedly, sometimes yes. I pat <br>  myself on the back and say "I have the amazing ability to get <br>  things done at the last minute."<br>  <br>  Do I usually end up regretting my procrastination? Almost <br>  always. So I've had to learn ways to get things done now, on <br>  time. I'm still learning and always will be. Procrastination is <br>  a persistent thief!<br>  <br>  Procrastination is an expensive way to spend your life. Waiting <br>  until the last minute can even cost you your life. And when you <br>  "spend" your life mired in procrastination, you don't truly <br>  live. You are perpetually putting off living.<br>  <br>  Focusing on quitting smoking, how many times have you said "I'm <br>  not ready to quit," or "I'll quit tomorrow," or "I'll quit when <br>  I'm not under so much stress"? What are you waiting for?|`|1dXDlZ03aa	HAPPY FRIDAY!<br>  <br>  i'm at school we get out in a few and i'm super excited.<br>  going to see Friday the 13th with my boyyyyy.<br>  <br>  have a great weekend all.|`|AUxHmud6aa	Yes that would be me also.....happy Friday<br>  Come on 5 o'clock!!|`|RRZagexfaa	you.|`|JPDxyTT3aa	snappy friday. <br>  <br>  and yes ive been counting down since 2 pm. <br>  <br>  lol|`|dKhFJwiqaa	I am, does anyone wanna grab some drinks at the bar tonight on me.|`|J9sJz46Eaa	hey!! same here!!|`|fP05U8Neaa	*Raises hands*<br>  <br>  Thank you and Happy Friday to you too!|`|fGbPI3N0aa	that would be me too!!!!! and happy friday to you to|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Well I got laid off, as well as 1000 other people in this town!!|`|tXFj8oSfaa	yeah, soo happy.|`|7ondIFO2aa	im at skool. 20 more min n im out|`|Gz9449J5aa	no school today for me yay|`|HNeYUXSXaa	im at school waiting for it to end!|`|pEHlNEtEaa	quack in my butt|`|wam93FEdaa	nice day|`|U8pwoW1jaa	That would be me also woot!

jjh1DDftaa	When I asked my Nana if she liked scary stories, (this was about 25 years ago) she said, "I watch the news every night, don't I?"<br>  When I was 10, I didn't get it...now I do.|`|wpNQLLyOaa	i hate the news.

But for 2 very good reasons.<br>  <br>  1. when I was like 7 we went camping and it rained the entire 3 days and every morning our tent was like river, I ended up very sick<br>  <br>  2. I am deathly afraid of bugs! Have you noticed how full of bugs the woods are? I would die if something like crawled on me.......AHHHH ok got the heebie jeebies now LOL

gGZz2EGyaa	I think he is just being bitter, he was not the worst skater at the end of the day.  Its votes that count and obviously his fans were not voting for him and so he ended up in the skate off.  This was his second chance to make something of this show and he still did not make it to the final, so no point in being cruel about everything and everybody.  I do not think that the judges marks are low because I do not think that there is any skater that stand out more then the rest.  They all seem to be at the same level, well except for Ray who is good, except for Todd who is hopeless.|`|bNykcEVXaa	He must have felt that coming...?      dR bad  right up his jackxy|`|SHeLdu8haa	He could well be right....I have noticed that the scoring seems a little haywire.|`|QASqKvSNaa	Bitter.|`|AA10077992	A bit of both I reckon. He's becoming a proper little gossipmonger isn't he ? lol1|`|aKhZNd7daa	I'm going for a bit of both here Whip lol|`|lReSpTijaa	Yes I think he could be onto something but I bet he'd have kept his big gob shut if he'd still been in.|`|hTrqYiwJaa	I don't know why he is even bothering to comment. It's not as if he can skate.|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	I think there is a lot of disappointment from being knocked out knowing weaker skaters are being kept in, but I definitely think that there is truth in what he's saying though. This has been the strangest year when it has come to scoring with no consistency whatsoever.|`|82A8E4yzaa	HES A HYPOCRATIC !    he was saying last sunday '' i love this show..im so pleased i have been on it'' and when he broke his leg 2 years ago..he started to cry like a baby !    Funny enough when he leaves it...hes already making out like he hated it..!|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I think they are scoring very low toward he lads ok Todd yes but the lads have been ok and coleen and Milanda not so good|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	sour grapes Whip ,they're all gonna get the boot as some point he should just accept it and move on , having said that i do think Ruthie has her fave which is Zoe and Ray is Jase's fave ,maybe he just wasn't that popular with the viewing public !!|`|aGwjf2y4aa	i think the scoring is all over the place it seems a much better skater will only get haklf a point more than a bad skater bit of a joke  todd makes me laugh he is so crap
EuwjIJ3Zaa	Venus(which is outside of the orb) and Sun opposition a stellium in Capricorn (specifically Saturn) will most certainly do this...  Venus/'Sun/Saturn contacts can be difficult.  Sometimes these individuals feel that deep down they are unworthy of love.      Using a pretty wide orb, her Moon is in Opposition to her Pluto.  Foul aspects to the Moon can make someone have a very hard time feeling 'safe'.  Something might feel 'not right' under pressure for her.    Her Mars squares her Moon.  She may feel uncomfortable expressing her emotions through actions.  Like there's a way real conflict between those, as if they work at cross purposes for her.    Just a couple of things to look at.  The exact birthtime is really important, as the houses the planets are sitting in could tell a lot more.  Sun in 12th,  or Saturn, Uranus and or Neptune are in the 4th, for example?    For one, Cancer's are very, very sensitive. When generational planets, like her stellium in Capricorn, make contact with personal planets, it can be quite difficult.  Neptune aspecting the Sun, can be tough.  The Sun is our core selves, and Neptune is associated with dreaminess, and even delusion sometimes. She might not feel confident in herself, at all sometimes.    Interesting about her Venus though... Some astrologers would say that her Mars in Leo conjuncts it, but it's with a wide orb, and outside of like signs.  Other astrologers would say her Venus is being unaspected, by all the other planets.  It's just there on it's own, atleast when considering the major bodies.    You should try and find her exact time of birth, and see what house her Venus is in.  That can tell a lot.    The thing about a planet with no aspects, is that a person may have a really difficult time tapping into it.  No transfer of energy, can be an issue; or on the flip side, she's got the Cancer Crab Shell wrapped around it in all it's glory.    So, those are just a few things to check out.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	She's only 19. I don't date that much either, I guess you can say I "exclude" myself from dating but that doesn't mean I'm lonely. If I were lonely I'd probably go out and find a mate.  I'm sure your sister would do the same.    I much older than that and I still don't date that much. I go years in between boyfriends. I'm not afraid of growing a lonely old woman with 27 cats and I'm sure your sister doesn't feel that way either.    She's confident in herself thus secure without a partner. It's not something to be concerned about, I think that's great!  Just know that when she finally falls in love it will be for real, not because she's afraid to be alone and needs the security of a partnership.    Don't worry!|`|HZxX9ke8aa	moon taurus = high aesthetical and emotional standarts alright, since venus rules that sign... knows what she wants can't accept anything less.    sun cancer = and now that very handsome person has to be domestic, loyal and caring too.    venus cancer = empowering what i said above.    what's asc node? well, i'll assume it's ascendant and not north or south node or something = add more stubbornness to the mix. tend to be unique and unconventional. an idealist.|`|B7WIZdglaa	maybe shes just not ready yet. It takes some people longer than others to really "get it". My best friend started seriously dating when we were 14, and until I was 17, I had no idea why she would want to waste her time with a boyfriend. She will come around i'm sure.    Another conclusion-- maybe, just maybe- she doesnt like guys. Not saying she likes girl, but I have a friend who is almost 27, and has NEVER had a serious gf. Has NEVER had sex. He's def not gay, but he almost has no interest in dating woman. Weird.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	This has nothing to do with astrology, but let me tell you something.  Just because she's your sister doesn't mean you know her at all.  I have a sister who thinks she knows me.  She has all kinds of opinions about why I do things.  She knows NOTHING.  We grew up in the same house.  We are three years apart.  I was sexually abused by my mother and another sister.  She thinks she 'knows' it never happened.  She's wrong.  Alot of my behavior is the result of trauma that according to the little know it all, never happened.  This little bytch is constantly explaining my life to me as if SHE knows what's affected me.  As if SHE knows what I've experienced.  I have solved the problem.  I don't bother with the little c----anymore.

rcNQvCeXaa	try highlights or low lights depending whether yo want to go darker or lighter, To get natural looking lights do them in different shades maybe 3 tones and very fine but a lot so you see the change and its subtle and flattering. Get it done by a professional though , they will advise you on ash, gold or auburn tones for your hair and what suits yor skin type best, let us know how it goes and what you decide.|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	My ex sister-in-law used to put henna highlights in her natural dark brown hair. It made her have some really beautiful brownish-red (auburn) coloured hair with highlights. Or what about a shade lighter or darker than you are now? Or maybe a very dark (dishwater a/k/a "dirty") blonde? It depends on just how dark your hair really is, hun, and your skintone is, as to what would look great on you. I would probably consult a professional hair stylist cause they usually know what the best look for you would be, especially if you are going for a totally different look. <br>  <br>  It's awful when dramatic colouring grows out. Look at all of those awful looking peroxide blonde celebrities and their big dark streak down the middle and their really dark eyebrows. Ewwww. That's definitely not a good look.  Lol. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't do anything really dramatic, highlights perhaps, but that's just me. Or as I said, one shade darker or lighter than what my hair colour actually is...|`|d4f6400ded99a1dec7d1c509edd9fae1aa	Well assuming you are the colour of your avatar maybe try black or a really cool red.|`|67f34282988bfc3fb8c3c876e7296801aa	How about becoming a fellow redhead|`|3oIcUB8Faa	Red or strawberry blonde.|`|Gxp4KmsIaa	brown it is in style in 2009 & 2010 i am so not kidding|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	It would help to know what color it is first.

It allows me to relieve so much that have inside that at the end of that long painful cry I'm back to being my strong self.|`|eOb841qbaa	yes. already a long good cry it makes me feel stronger because i released all of that bad energy inside of me. (:|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	I don't know about stronger , but according to doctors, it'll make me live longer.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	no, however it is a good way to vent your feelings and become calm afterwords.|`|XwFGg5wPaa	lol no just puffy eyed and traumatized|`|9UhoUcM2aa	yes it actualllly does.. <br>  <br>  if you hold all your emotions inside.. you will have a break down at some point..|`|EsufC1qhaa	ok, im a guy, but sorry. yes crying does make you stronger. im saying this from a psychological point of view. it will keep all your sadness or anxiety off the chest and makes your nerves calmer and more relaxing. this in turn will make you feel better and make you feel confident. so the answer is 'yes' .  <br>  <br>  cry out when you have to, it's not good to keep bad thoughts inside and hide them and hide them more, this will create mental tension.  <br>  <br>  thats why they say people who express their emotions openly are 60 % more happier than whose who don't.  after all, everything is health.|`|CFFxtileaa	Yes. When you have a good cry it stops you from wanting to cry when you're sad about something. <br>  Its like, everything builds up one on top of the other and then finally you break down and cry all of it out, then you don't feel like you need to cry anymore, and sometimes you even feel happy and sort of refreshed afterwards.<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|HVcga9UGaa	yes it can it helps vent out any frustration just dont cry for everything <br>  dont forget there is nothing wrong with crying|`|qRM0r7eVaa	I dont think so but its good to release your feelings of whatever every now and then.|`|UdemZ27caa	maybe not...but it makes you feel relieved.|`|7ondIFO2aa	no|`|cBxG0BbZaa	no|`|ibRjKfvBaa	I sure hope so.|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	sometimes... it usually makes me feel weak and vulnerable... but i feel great after :)|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	NO-crying is a form of blackmail and makes you look weak|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I feel it makes me weaker.  I know I shouldn't look at it but whenever I cry it's because I'm in a situation where I feel powerless.|`|fguyiSIjaa	I guess so, in that it lets you get rid of excess frustration and emotion. I don't let people see me cry though. That might make me a hypocrite :P|`|4nQVsEHnaa	it just helps get out frustration and it gets rid of some water weight|`|M7W7lZBBaa	no it just gets me all snotty and those stupid hiccup breaths and a red nose

AA10053661	The best relationships I've had were with full trust and we both had many friends of the opposite sex. How could you feel possessive when you felt so confident about the love? <br>  <br>  But when all signs point to the fact that a lot of secretive things are going on behind your back...... well, it's not that I get possessive as much as just want the truth and want him to confess what  is going on. The way I look at it, why stay around if someone needs another or would prefer another? I don't want someone holding on to me while being with another...... doesn't show respect for either of us. So I'm not about to be possessive. I just want the truth so I can move on and the next girl deal with it.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	nope,jealousy and possessive tendencies are a sign of insecurity|`|YW1DXceqaa	nope...'nuff said|`|dDDAbqqhaa	i'd hate to have a daughter, i'd kick the guys she brings home back to the gutter|`|jYmvtUC5aa	...no maam..........nuff said.....|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Only to a degree.

I personally would rather be alone than in a insecure relationship. The irony of it all is the one thing you are doing to try to keep them is actually driving them further away. <br>  <br>  Who said God does not have a sense of humor?|`|TODzjTczaa	Absolutely.  I'm possessive because I have found my soulmate, and she is mine.  She agrees.  We've been together for more than 17 years, we have a baby boy, and I lay claim to her on a frequent basis.|`|4Yk53Ly3aa	I'm possesive about everything...so don't even think about it...|`|KXs6Y0APaa	Nope.|`|xQ3q2PDmaa	No.|`|sP8KrvA7aa	A little bit, yes.

Not afraid of commitment....just getting close.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	well would you cuddle with an alligator?|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	ABSOLUTELY ..........<br>  <br>  very very much so ...

Most of the time it makes me feel alive.|`|f9b40efd5b7600a550f492fb27e76707aa	yes|`|O00i9157aa	it makes me more cautious yes.|`|oDL02s8kaa	yes and yes!!|`|qhU3PDgfaa	yes.<br>  i prefer to run away from things that are going to hurt / harm me..|`|AA10053661	Doesn't keep me from getting close as a friend. But I will generally keep it at that unless I am super duper uber without a doubt sure I'm not setting myself up for disappointment. <br>  <br>  But I love getting close to friends...... friends don't let you down NEARLY as much!! :) xoxo|`|yIdwMPsoaa	No. I always end up getting close to my boyfriend after a fight or a break up. But it did happen that I got scared of getting hurt so I kept my distance. Well kind of.<br>  Anyway. I maybe didn't give the best example.

WQvDIhmgaa	Nope, I'm defensive because others are usually wrong....by nature|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Yes. It could be paranoia to some degree. It's not a good thing. Best to keep it under control. I try to see where people are going. I prefer people to be direct and honest. If there is a problem then tell me. I can handle it. Agree?|`|zRUHryuraa	I was trying to think of a witty answer to this question but I couldn't<br>  <br>  but ye i guess i am|`|AA10838250	yes|`|M4PMGw2Zaa	Yes...is there any particular reason you're asking this question or was it random?|`|IpgzUP8Raa	lol yeah<br>  <br>  thumb up if you like my avatar...thumb down if i should change it|`|AA11120056	NO!!!!! Why would you ask a question like that!?!?!?! What's wrong with you?!!?!?!?!?|`|3USNsjlTaa	Yeh|`|RjCKSE2saa	Why do you ask?|`|3yKWT4WRaa	yes|`|lt7gcuw0aa	yep|`|ft8t98Pnaa	oh yes!!!!

2MZZ7Wtwaa	I tripped over the bottom of a clothes rack in a dept. store.  Seems like I fell for 30 minutes!  I prayed no one saw but when I looked up from the floor there were at least 4 pairs of eyes looking at me.  I could have disappeared under a piece of dust I was so embarrassed.  =(|`|AA12094990	I tripped over something and I just kept walking like nothing had happened. lol
AA10032971	If you are legal and want a 'mellow drink,' just go for the best one that you can find. Which glass or container that you use, is your prerogative. The point here is what pleases you. Peace!|`|Lljkj0EFaa	Knife has already passed you his homemade hooch....<br>  Oh why, oh why, don't they give him a warning.<br>  Now, when you start looking like RuPaul, don't come a crying to me.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I'll take the wine. I want to be aware of my surroundings and capable of running through the swamps if I need to.|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	FK is awesome!<br>  <br>  I prefer to just skip all the fancy-schmancy stuff and I just like to swill beer right out of the bottle.  If I drink wine, I usually just drink that out of the bottle too.<br>  <br>  I don't like to use a glass because then I'd have to wash it, and then I'd waste water, so basically I'm doing my part for the environment.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	I too, drink from the bottle.  It serves several purposes:  saves me having to wash a glass and sometimes, it grosses people out and they wont drink after me--so there's more for me.  <br>  <br>  FK is awesome<br>  <br>  I thought mason jars WERE nice glasses?|`|3SWe11Knaa	Can't you go blind from homemade hooch? I don't care. I'd risk it, but then again, I'll try anything.<br>  <br>  I know two places that serve Long Island Ice Tea in Mason jars. Three of those and you might as well be blind...|`|RnwrEcY5aa	I tend to avoid hooch. Good memories but not a good idea. <br>  <br>  But a good white Zinfandel should always be served from a long stemmed wine glass.  And with friends.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|vtiea9eTaa	Hooch from the mason jar for sure. I live in the land of the micro brews, and we use large mason jars just to bring beer from the microbreweries home in. Then of course, I drink right out of them. Glass is glass man. I prefer microbrew of either porters or stouts and I prefer red wine, pinot noir or shiraz. = )|`|ZUkals6laa	I would prefer a nice glass of Pinot Grigio...it's very fruity and light on the palette, since I tend to find red wine too sour for me. But then again, after a few rounds of either, you don't really notice the difference, lol.<br>  <br>  Hooch? I didn't realize that we were chilling in a 1920's cellar, with an old man stirring a bubbling cauldron, saying "now, you have to try this...this is the 'good stuff'"... i say hell to the no. ;)|`|My2aEyK5aa	If it's made of glass it's too fancy to hold either...mmmmm...ether...

Before we were married, on my wife's first visit, there was nude wedding in progress.<br>  <br>  My first time was a bit strange.  It took me forever to disrobe and to calm down.  My first reaction after settling down?  I was angry about being cheated out of the experience all those years. The rest of the day was wonderful.

pvJH5HQ5aa	I dont know. My Mom was beaten and abused for years, so was i. By her ex, who was a lawyer himself. Any person that does that is cold and heartless. I feel so much symathy for Rhianna, but admire her for being strong enough to get help. My mom didnt, and i went to school with bruises and cuts every day. Every one looked, and whispered, but no one came to help. Untill one teacher, who i now admire, and love to death, said something. The police showed up that night, right at the time he was beating my mom, i was up next. Any person who can do that to any one, has no heart, or at least a cold, mean, bitter heart.

On the Jimmy Durante show no less!<br>  <br>  My be here now tune is different from my "theme song", but this one has stood by me for over 35  years.  I've never been there, but I've painted the picture of it in my mind using John's lyrics and guitar.|`|AA10246871	My first snarky thought was this song:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5IVuN1N6-Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5IVuN1N6...</a><br>  <br>  I thought of it because I was, once, the one who was loved, but not often the one he was with. It sucked.<br>  <br>  I think this might be closer to what you are looking for, at least it is for me:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh0FrNEgU5I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh0FrNEgU...</a><br>  <br>  That always makes me think of what is going on in other people's lives right now--it brings me back to center and makes me realize that I am not the only person on this planet. Remember the original video? There was a very touching visual--a bunch of migrant workers getting into the back of a pickup truck with the comment that right now someone is working way too hard for what they are being paid. Having seen my fair share of "undocumented" people working their butts off and doing more than a fair day's work for less than a fair day's pay, that really hit me in the guts.|`|LyZhJB1Baa	Oasis- Be Here Now?|`|2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Shades,<br>  I think this song's less direct than some of the others here, but it resonates also as a 'here and now' song.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBexpzc8Be8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBexpzc8B...</a><br>  <br>  The lyric line that comes to mind re your question is "He's not concerned with yesterday, he knows constant change is here to stay..."|`|d6d7524d2d19955704c3554f38513834aa	That is a great songs and the lyrics are timeless.

So, one of them said they wanted milk, so I went to the grocery store and bought a quart of milk. The milk carton said that it will expire on 2/29/09. Then, I realized that I have no more money left. If I'm correct I, then got kidnapped until 2/28/09. (I escaped.)  <br>  <br>  I have been locked up in a house for 5 days, and the Jonas brothers didn't look for me (I'm a servant.) <br>   Then, I saw them.<br>  Me: Want some ice-cream?<br>  J Brothers: I thought you only had the money for the milk, and where is the milk?<br>  Me: (held up the milk.) It reads it'll expire on 2/29/09.<br>  J Bro: WTF!!! There's no such thing as 2/29/09. Ok...how about the ice cream?<br>  Me: I stole them!<br>  J Bro: WTF<br>  And so we ran when the ice-cream shop owner came to chase us.<br>  J Bro: MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE, DON'T MESS WITH SOMEONE WHO RUNS FAST!<br>  <br>  I think that's it....

What Jack told as was "baloney" as it wasn't true and he knows that fact.<br>   It refers to the nonsense of something.<br>   IT is also a commune or community in France on the island of Corsica.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	its where they take the real meat shavings and scrape it up into a pile and make it into bologna...just like hot dogs....nothing but round bologna|`|4GCH1lTyaa	meat by-products..in other words...left over meat compressed into a loaf and sliced|`|AA10838250	sometimes refer to as lunch meat

9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	Since I am a short guy (roughly 5'7"), I probably go best with either the "Small and cute," "Medium small," or "Medium tall."  Most of the "Tall and Leggy" ones probably want someone their height or taller.  However, if one of them is interested, I won't let height get in the way.|`|56bNLJykaa	Medium-small to Medium-tall..  but it really doesnt matter

uQUqZ7k5aa	i got the non-break up, she randomly told me" i feel like we already broke up" when i came up to see her.|`|Hjqd7MAoaa	call me can i be next bigmoney622000@yahoo,com lol|`|AA11940306	Dated a guy for 4 months,every weekend,then one weekend he just stopped calling or answering my calls....still to this day no explanation...I tried to get him to tell me something thru friends as well but no one would tell me a thing!After a few days of wondering I moved on..why waste my time for someone so thoughtless..ya know?=)|`|IkWRXHGXaa	I moved to Arkansas and got engaged to Ann and then after 4 months me, my finance (Ann) & her friend (Amanda) went to TX. to spend a week with one of Amanda's friend and when we got to TX Ann left me and stared dating Amanda's friend and for one week (7 Days) I had to set in Bryan TX. watching and listing to my finance love, hug, kiss and talk about about what she she done in the bedroom. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  I had to set out there and deal with out because I was in Bryan TX. (first time there) and my family was in Atlanta, GA. and if I would have said one word are show one sign of anger I would been out on the the street.<br>  <br>  All top of that I have problems with the sun/heat if the temp is above 70F° I will black out. Will that time of the year we was there it was like 115F° to 125F° that whole week so I ended up passing out in the yard 2 time. <br>  <br>  So my first trip to Texas was not good. But I don't blame TX. are the people there and I would visit it again hoping for a better tip.<br>  --------------------------------------...
cE20wh1laa	i dont know about the "no matter what" bit hun, i'd stand by someone i loved through thick and thin, but there are certain things that are unforgivable or too hurtful and no matter how much i love that person i couldnt stay with them if they went totally against my principles or morals|`|CArzkDIUaa	If they're abusing you then no|`|NKuQh4sSaa	Yes it is , but there are lines that if crossed I wouldn't be able to forgive.|`|VlCax7DWaa	yes|`|cjdPh4Cuaa	I am not saying it's the right thing no matter what. Different situations calls for different decisions. but i am just so thankful that I have a husband and family who stands by me regardless.  I have really put them through a tremendous amount of grief and given them every reason to disown me...but they stood beside me and loved me til I came back to reality!!!!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Depends...|`|7L7zpAT6aa	Yes as long as your standing buy them for the right reason.|`|7KXN0DDbaa	no , fairy first , lover second..|`|d23F89ECaa	Come hell or high water.|`|it3ecbVEaa	i would no matter what,if you love someone enough that's what you do...|`|pLgQZqW0aa	yeah i guess|`|4FqP313qaa	yes.|`|gdGHuFA0aa	Yes i think so, I can honestly say i will be with my fiannce no matter what happens & i will never leave him when he needs me.<br>  If you truly love someone you would never have to question what you would do for them<br>  <br>  xxx|`|z1xBUi8Jaa	usually yes<br>  but it depends how bad they've done<br>  if their ill or have an addiction yes<br>  if they've got into big crime or had an affair, no|`|AUzPyikaaa	It depends on the no matter what part. If they hadn't caused anyone any harm then yes Stand by them....but if they had done something bad then no way.|`|iA5kZv15aa	Well it depends<br>  Yes would be my answer, but there are some boundaries that cannot be crossed or forgiven|`|uSNn3iJDaa	its the right thing but not necessarily the best thing.|`|qA3bJRCvaa	Yeah i mean is okay to disagree but you always have to be there for them and help them|`|ufdFei1jaa	You stand for what you believe is right.|`|Hlq5sw4waa	isn't that what love is|`|8HDlfG2Iaa	depends realyy , i did for the one i loved and he throw it all back in my face by lieng to me ,|`|W8Look0waa	If you love that person you should support them but there always a fine line to that|`|4WReav26aa	No way---- you were born as an individual!!!! Make up your own mind on that one!!|`|Tfd0z5Xhaa	depends what they have done.....|`|wpNQLLyOaa	um no. it depends greatly on what the person I love did|`|AA12361841	yes that is what I believe unless that person is a danger to u or someone else*|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	The s*** actually hitting the fan might be a reason to stand behind them.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	There's no matter what on this one. It depends on what the situation is. I have a girlfriend that's a slob. She leaves clothes around and stuff, dirty dishes, etc. and she lives with me. Moved in with me, and my Momma didn't raise me to be that nasty, and sloppy. It causes problems in our relationship. She wants me to marry her, I can't get over that and a few other things that bugs me. I like a tidy neat home, and she's totally the opposite of that. People come over thinking I'm living foul and nasty and it's not me...it's her! She gets attitudes and say I'm trying to start a fight, and she'll say it's fine the way it is. I be like, "No, it's not...straighten this stuff up, wash this dishes it can draw roaches!" I don't think Love can conquer this problem that we have together. She's always lived messy and I've always lived neat! So the answer to your question, NO! Stand by yourself, and don't put up with something just to say you're in love.

Frivolous I know, damned kid insists on eating.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	People are stupid! I will probably use mine to pay back the $$$ I owe the leeches at the IRS for cashing out my 401K (best decision I ever made though. I got out of debt, and still had some to save after that. I got out of debt before the economy went to $hit!!). So either way, the leeches will get their $$$ back from me!|`|XCn2dK1laa	Saving it's the wrong thing to do because the economy NEEDS people to buy things to get consumer prices down.That's why my parents have spent it on entertainment things AFTER they've paid the bills and whatnot|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	my coworker did that and she's now saying that she needs to save money.. btw, she bought gold jewelry.  well,, if you didnt spend it you would have it. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i'm going straight to the bank.|`|yGQgdYNwaa	I am using it to move into a nicer apartment. My lease is up in March.If I ever get it.|`|Zd6q5s2Kaa	SAVE IT!!! Make some interest! And prob pay off my credit card|`|mNsrj6cvaa	This is a very good question. Most people, like me, pay off their debt. Though some people spend it on manufactured goods. In this case, it isn't all that bad for the economy because people are spending money and contributing to business funds. <br>  <br>  So, hypothetically: Jane gets a tax refund and buys a new laptop. Tom, the owner, gets most of money from it and pays it off to his employees, and the rental fee of the store, etc.<br>  <br>  This brings me to one of the many points I have: DON'T TAX THE RICH! THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE MOST SPENDING AND CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO OUR ECONOMY!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|oiJi8RJ7aa	Because, ooh im going to sound all smart here lol, <br>  <br>  I actually heard that we shouldn't just save money cos that will make things worse, you have to spend your money so other people get it then it kinda comes back to you, like just keep things going as normal I mean. If we save up money no one else gets it and that like slows down the economy or something. But it really makes sense if you understood all that.<br>  <br>  Haha (:|`|so95ktlIaa	The whole thing is <br>  <br>  people need to spend money because that is how taxes are paid.....at a local level. when people don't buy the stuff they dont need then they arent paying sales taxes. <br>  <br>  Futhermore, if we dont consumer then people like China (who also passed a stimilus bill) suffer as well. <br>  <br>  Basically if we dont spend....no one makes money.|`|pS9ZAW43aa	Great question!  Why do people always spend their returns on stuff they don't need anyways? Especially when you are in debt and need to use the money for everyday living. Instead they buy a new TV and get into even more debt. Hey maybe they will get a big Bailout!|`|WLoQOpPSaa	I've never had a tax return, do you live in america? you seem to get more in the way of money back than in the uk,I hardly ever hear of anyone getting money back.|`|wpNQLLyOaa	you have to spend money in order to improve the economy. and I spent all mine some bills and other frivolous items.|`|j27SONW9aa	well i dont get any...but my parents...must likely pay bills and save it

She refuses to live in the capital city, and instead she lives in her home in Wasilla, commutes to Anchorage for work (when she bothers to work), AND CHARGES THE STATE PER DIEM TO LIVE AT HER OWN HOUSE!!!

Usually their agents are booking tours, signings, show appearances, trying to land them a part in a major motion picture or some type of commercial. It all depends on what type of celebrity they are. I would think that writers would be more prone to hanging around their homes than movie stars would.<br>  <br>  Once they become well known, I would venture to guess it's very hard to go out in public with an entourage following behind or in a limo with them.

Personally, I am against these drugs.|`|PpaaRkm9aa	They balance levels of certain brain chemicals.|`|ded808853f2e26f3c03a870d532ebb95aa	The seratonin answer is the right one.  Your brain produces a natural chemical called seratonin.  Although there is no clear cut evidence, it is belived that the brains of depressed patients have lower levels of seratonin.  Antidepressants increase the amount of seratonin absorbed by the brain.  They do work - I've been on them for years!  however there are a number of different ones and they work in different ways.  There are older style ones and newer ones, the newer ones - or SSRIs as they're known - include Prozac, fluvovoxamine and paroxetine etc.  They can produce a slightly 'hyper' feeling to start with and do take a while to start working, so the key is to stay with them and to couple medication along with counselling and or therapy.  I am a firm believer that you need to address the problem in a holistic way.|`|iA5kZv15aa	They act on receptors in your brain to either increase the flow of chemicals to make you happier or to block those that make you depressed.<br>  However, they don't get to the route of your depression and they can become addictive.  It's better to deal with the cause of your depression, either by solving the problem or accepting it, being positive and moving on.|`|c8DjmWXxaa	Antidepressants are often prescribed to people suffering from depressive illness. Depressive illness is caused by a decrease of certain chemicals or neurotransmitters in the brain that are responsible for mood. Antidepressants stimulate chemical changes that increase the levels of these neurotransmitters. Three main neurotransmitters associated with mood are serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Different antidepressant medications affect one or more of these neurotransmitters.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Depression in part is caused by a lack of seretonin (a hormone which helps you to feel happier). Most people make enough naturally but some people with depression just don't produce enough. Anti-Depressents help the body to start the process of making more seretonin thus making you feel normal.|`|uDozl6TGaa	i was told<br>  <br>  it 1st makes you way worst & then changes the brain in the way you think....

So that was my story, it was more of a coincidence then a funny story but i was laughing at the time cuz i couldnt get over how much of a coincidence it was.

rYdsywgyaa	Loyalty - you should be able to count on your best friend for just about everything, even if your life depends on it.<br>  <br>  Understanding - your friend shouldn't get pissed off at you for a mistake unless it really affects them in a harmful way.  They should also help you get through your own mistakes.<br>  <br>  Trustworthiness - obviously, you should be able to tell your buddy anything.  That is a special bond you can have with this person.  You should definitely be able to tell them your most personal feelings.<br>  <br>  All of these three are related to each other.  Trustworthiness is a part of loyalty, understanding is fueled by your friend's loyalty, and loyalty is supported by trustworthiness.  This may seem overly detailed, but, I like to be specific with my answers, I enjoy helping people.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|tmVoiH6iaa	~  being faithful<br>  ~  trustworthy...<br>  ~ & simple minded!! ^-^|`|TgT6Agjbaa	nice looking<br>  <br>  <br>  refreshing personality <br>  <br>  <br>  funny.<br>  <br>  <br>  ( i dont hang out with ugly people , lol )|`|aPj8xaj0aa	trust<br>  <br>  always there to lend a hand<br>  <br>  someone you have fun with|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Unselfish<br>  Good Human Being<br>  Commited|`|vMeSBnE1aa	honesty<br>  <br>  empathetic<br>  <br>  trustworthy

NKuQh4sSaa	I am from England and sad to say they do get racism , but it is not just Indians that get racist abuse . Pakistani, Polish , Africans and a few other ethnic people all get racist abuse by a few morons . It is wrong that a few mindless bigots tar the majority of English with the same racist brush . We are not all racist , I certainly am not .|`|E5rhAaLGaa	yeah i do at school, it depends what area you are from, if you live in a society were they're alot of indians thats not a problem..|`|frwlypDWaa	At least England didn't put all their Indians on reservations...|`|f2c691cb03d9d6b21303d0a416f0ad3daa	im not sure but Pakistani people do.|`|jV99kgWbaa	In every country you will find some people who hate those from other countries.  There are those who treat others badly everywhere you go. But they are the exceptions, thankfully. Most do not do that.  <br>  <br>  In England there is a law against racism.  It would illegal, for example, to discriminate against an Indian in jobs. If you were turned down for a job solely because of that, you could take a claim against the company concerned. <br>  <br>  So, I think you have been misinformed. England is probably the most liberal country in the world when it comes to welcoming those from other countries, and non-discrimination is built into English law and education.  Racism is one of the taboos in the UK. It's very frowned on.<br>  <br>  All the best.<br>  <br>  PS To the answerer who saw the yobs give trouble. That's totally unacceptable in any society.  It should be reported to the police. Harrassment is an offence, and the owners shouldn't have to put with it.  Tell them to install CCTV if they don't already have it, and to record any further incidents, which will help the police prosecute.<br>  <br>  And to Thelit... totally agree :)|`|f0CR2CpCaa	dont believe what you hear...<br>  <br>  <br>  THERE IS RACISM IN ALL COUNTRIES<br>  england is a very multicultural country with high tolerance and familiarity with different cultures<br>  it is nowhere near as bad as what your hearing<br>  dont make sweeping generalisations in THIS GENERATION english people are mostly free from prejudice|`|iA5kZv15aa	I'd love to say no, but yes they do.<br>  My stepdaughter went to the local Indian shop only last night and she told me the owners were getting terrible abuse from the local yobs.<br>  It's appalling.  I know them personally and they're a really nice family|`|MTF0Rz90aa	I have travelled all over the world and to be honest with you Indians are not badly treated in England. There are stupid people all over the world and even in a country like the UK some people still think they are better than others.<br>  Ja.|`|PclzbI1naa	Yeah people are racist here towards Indians<br>  <br>  It's not so much the colour of their skin, but people seem to get them mixed up with Pakistanis.|`|aog9gSm1aa	Quite well, majority own shops and treated well in the community, also have nurse and doctors jobs.<br>  <br>  I personally get on well with Indian people no problem.|`|zRUHryuraa	Not if they open a takaway|`|bljBwqCaaa	well...i'm English and white, and i'm not racist..|`|JjsqQJcCaa	I live in england and from my experience no. I'm "white British" so i don't speak from personal experience. There are always racist people in any part of the world, but i feel the large majority of English are educated well enough to accept different races (increasingly more so) and as a result of a more culturally diverse population nowadays (especially in cities like London where there is a large % foreign population) people accept others well.|`|yte0BzXKaa	I'm from England. Alot of the Indian's that we are racist to are generally racist to us in the first place.<br>  One boy in my school scared the full class by saying ''and you never know, i might just be a suicide bomber''<br>  <br>  Some Indians are treat badly because some English people are idiots.<br>  But usually the Indians deserve to be treated how they are, by abusing the word 'racist'.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I cant think of a decent reason to why 7 people could thumbs down my answer, they were probably all indians.|`|klOP21xTaa	No problems at all with indians, there is a indian restaurant sometimes like 10 in every town, whites love indian food more than our own food, birmingham is very big for it, i m white and i think i can say that as long as you are legally here and are a peaceful kind then you ll be fine, however if you are one of these jihadi types don't come you are not welcome. Indian girls are nice but they tend to keep to there own which i respect.|`|5b3uOQc6aa	Yes, we do. I'll tell you that as a British Indian.<br>  I know a woman who got her plait chopped off while she was shopping!<br>  We used to live in an all white neighbourhood and they used to set the dogs on us. Depends where you live as well mainly. Up north is BAD.<br>  However, I know some of the most gentlest white people. My best friends were white and they loved my black hair, hehe.<br>  We think the same way and act the same, but we'll never be truly seen as 'English'. I mean, seriously I speak more eloquent english than any white person I've met!<br>  Some Indians have tried to assimilate and 'pretend' they are white thus losing their culture whilst others fight hatred with hatred. It's sad.<br>  We have so many anti-rascist laws in this country but you can't change the way people think.<br>  However, in recent years there is less racism in regards to colour. Now it's religion. <br>  God unite us all. We come from one father, Adam. We're brethren in humanity. No race is superior than any other, except the best in deeds. God bless.|`|tkVCjeqmaa	I'm in England and they don't get any racism where i live..|`|CYFCzEJtaa	not badly|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	As a former Trade Union Officer, I can say that institutional racism against Indian and Pakistani people was widespread in the local council where I worked.<br>  <br>  People are aware that the use of racist epithets will get them in trouble... so the racism takes the form of bullying and intimidation and also the unspoken acceptance that white people 'belong' more than black or Asian people.<br>  <br>  My Trade Union was no better than the employer in this regard.  I had to fight to represent black workers and it became difficult to get elected to my union role because the majority of members were white!<br>  People I had helped in the past refused to even talk to me, and my branch eventually ostracised me.<br>  <br>  Racism is rampant in British society.  Any one who says differently is either unknowing or uncaring.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Yes, they do<br>  <br>  Britain is the most racist place on earth

MNja3iwMaa	at last! someone else who sees through this farce she is making of her illness. good question, interested to see how many people think what a horrible person you are for asking this.  good on you!|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Why cant everyone just leave her alone,she is dying,and her boys will soon be without a mommy....If Shilpa can forgive jade and put the past to rest,why cant everybody else,she has even told people to pray for jade in her time of need.She needs support,not all these nasty comments,give the girl a break,and show some respect...|`|asAWGIgnaa	excuse me but i think you are ridiculous. what jade is going through is really diffiult, painful and leaving to small children without a mother is heartbreaking and you are a jerk. no one is saying that jade hasnt made mistakes in the past (the rasism, thing) and personally i dont think she is a rasist and never has been, it just got too much public attention and was blown way to much out of porportion, i am not however condoling what she done. And as for the guy her husband beat up... its not a good thing at all, and again im not condolling it, but what has that got to do with jade, she did not comiut the crime, she is just marrying the man who did it because she loves him, it is her dying wish. i am not even a jade fan and i think she is strong for doing this. and you Mr *** hole, do not forget that jade going public with her cancer will save many many young womens lives, she shows them to get regualr smear checks because it can happen to anyone at anytime- and i dought her, herself doesnt realise how many lives she will save. you are a hyporcritical unhappy jerk, who should leave things in the past and stop being a complete **** whole!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|it3ecbVEaa	the racism was before she had cancer so it is not an excuse.<br>  and jack is not her husband until sunday after they get married, <br>  <br>  the poor girl is suffering for heavens sake she is 27 and has two small children, leave the girl alone, she has had enough slating over the years...<br>  <br>  have you ever seen anyone dying of cancer, i have and it is not nice... we have had 2 people close to us die in the last year, both within months of being diagnosed with cancer... they suffer terribly and are in the most horrendous pain you could not imagine.<br>  <br>  <br>  if they could have had the coverage jade has, and made money out of it for their family's i am sure they would have...|`|zxzfmXDTaa	Oh my god leave her alone that money is for her CHILDREN TWO BOYS AGED FOUR AND FIVE!!!!!!!!!Who will soon be faced with life without there mummy !|`|wZc2gsq0aa	give it a rest you fcukwit|`|4a66d12ad0952e5ec7eb7656964ff567aa	I don't blame Ms Goody in the slightest for milking the system dry and taking everything she can to ensure her children's future.  Can't help but think that Shannon M's mother only did the same.  The public seems to admire people whose only claim to fame is fame itself, whatever the cost. We have one  very sick, dying young woman who, for her kids, does the only thing she can - be a celebrity. Perhaps we should take this into consideration the next time we switch on some reality tv programme.  We laugh and are fascinated by the indignity of every day life whose only interest is that they are just like us, we "live" by proxy.  Should we as a society not be more than a little ashamed to "die" by proxy? Live television....  ?<br>  <br>  My respectful best wishes to Ms Goody|`|8Fqd4xEfaa	IT IS not jade goodys husband yet and even if it were why should she give up her well deserved money to the guy her BOYFRIEND beat up!|`|0lACfoXSaa	Stop talking about Jade Goody. Your only adding to her "fame". Forget about her... we all soon will.|`|uDozl6TGaa	she should give that money to cancer Research .....

ZUL3drNgaa	one evening i was at home playing around with my absolutely obese chocolate lab, Lucy. Well. Lucy decides she gonna paw me. You know, where they swipe at you with their paw? Well, she got me in the eyeball. It bled like crazy and so my parents took me to the hospital. they had to put this stuff in my eye, and all i really remember is them shining some kind of blacklight in my eye. Before they did it, i was laying on a bed and had closed my eyes. I opened them like two seconds late and asked my parents (who were right next to me) if they had put me to sleep just then. Apparently I was just very tired, and no, they hadn't. The whole time before they did whatever they did to fix it, I'm just walking around the hospital with a paper towel to my eye. lol. Then we went home. I do remember my mother getting mad at the people at the hospital for some reason, but I don't remember why. I was around nine or ten when it happened. =><br>  wow, your story is so much more interesting! lol. i love it.

So my technique sucks and i wouldn't want to teach any little kid that. Even now i dont even set my full twist correctly. <br>  <br>  But i have taught rollerblading to tons of people and their children. i have a lot patience. But it comes a point where they either have to do or dont do it and theres no coaching for that.<br>  <br>  i ref'd basketball games at the school. That was fun. The crew seemed like whole bunch of stuck up jerks though. i liked watching people play. Its like having sports center right in your face. I hated to call a lot of fouls though and i sometimes second guessed myself. <br>  <br>  One time i didnt call a foul and the other reff was like "why didnt you call a foul on that" i replied "why doesnt that guy who thought he got filed go work out and quit getting bumped around, the gyms right down there."|`|BAlYRNN8aa	I've been a counsellor at summer camp and will the this summer too, i teach the kids new pranks and jokes lol jks...<br>  <br>  I teach them to swim, sports and all kinds of activities :)|`|S2tBYhCKaa	Speleology and related vertical techniques based <br>  in part on instruction credits received as under-grad.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	I am an AmPro certified racquetball instructor and I teach the short game of golf at church.....|`|OXleDYVQaa	Special Olympics, every year.

But the oil which being sold as baby oil is 100% mineral oil. This commonly used petroleum ingredient coats the skin just like plastic wrap. The skins natural skin barrier is disrupted as this plastic coating inhibits its ability to breathe and absorb the Natural Moisture factor (moisture and nutrition). The skins ability to release toxins is impeded by this 'plastic wrap,' which can promote acne and other disorders. This process slows down skin function and normal cell development causing the skin to prematurely age.|`|w87icQkoaa	I've seen this occur!

BUT the downs are good too ! Because when you are down, YOU MUST to go out, and meet other people, have fun ! For example : go to a disco, see a good movie, dance & be around your friends, because then you can`t think so much like " why i`m feeling so bad ?","what is wrong with me ?", "why is this life so cruel sometimes ?" and others <br>  NO, remember, the life can be always good, like you said, you can always get the best from your life, all it is in your hands, and DO NOT LET NEVER YOURSELF DOWN|`|Jqve5UPlaa	I'm totally the same position as you!

Many of them are publicity stunts but i would have to say i am kinda annoyed by that whole thing between Rihanna and Brown<br>  <br>  not saying that violence isn't a big deal, but i dont care about them!|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Yep Heidi and Spencer.... cheesiest, most attention seeking people i have ever seen. I met them once and its funny because they seem real in person, but once the cameras come on they are all smiles and do crazy antics for publicity.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Definitely Brad and Angelina. I'm so sick of hearing about them.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	All of them.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Heidi and spencer are super annoying yea. But vanessa and Zac annoy me worse.

YbwDFvEaaa	I love that 90% of the answers ignore the fact "appearance" standards were specifically asked for...<br>  <br>  Anyway, there's actually studies that suggest what people find attractive on a women typically. Symmetrical features for one (eyes not crooked, etc), large more expressive eyes, clear skin (not just in the sense of pimples, but in not riddled with scars or birthmarks, etc.)<br>  <br>  I would agree that none of that should matter in terms of a relationship, but physical beauty is what it is. It exists whether we all possess it or not!|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	eyes and smile|`|p03Jc7eHaa	black high heels|`|AA11609168	its a group of things and beauty is not based on appearance alone....for me it takes kindness, inteligence, and humor,....looks come after that. <br>  <br>  <br>  For a girl to be hawt or attractive she just has to be sexy, meaning when you look at her you think about sex....this can be accomplished by many women by showing off their chest or wearing some tight jeans that make her butt look good OR a combination of the two....I have had many women who looked 10 times better with their clothes on than with their clothes off - clothing makes a big difference <br>  <br>  its up to you to choose how you want to attract guys.|`|CtUVT49Gaa	Im sorry to disagree but looks play an important part in first attractions...<br>  Lust first then love..|`|9UhoUcM2aa	a funny/unique personality, a pretty smile.. and confidence|`|wW6NJk4jaa	hygiene =)|`|AA10141581	to me, the first thing is her appearance, the way she carries herself. then come her confidence and looks and what not. looks aren't that important compared to the confidence|`|Rodj52Swaa	her personality|`|WFKbOtl8aa	if her face is symmetrical !<br>  and if her teeth are straight and white :)|`|ztb1F35Xaa	CONFIDENCE......beleive me it just shines rite thru|`|fT15YEkFaa	the ample camel toe (!) ?|`|OLcXtWQyaa	smile|`|z0Xom5Avaa	buns|`|HVcga9UGaa	hair makes the biggest first impression followed by a great smile <br>  trust me its all in the hair thats how i fell for my GF<br>  and her smile .... to die for soo cute  ^^|`|TSVNzx41aa	her personality<br>  <br>  appearance simply doesn't matter|`|eD687uffaa	personality and eyes|`|7izZ17ncaa	face, lips, Bum

I didn't mention my age in the past because I was afraid of not being taken seriously, and looked at as some dumb kid that they needed to talk down to (and anytime they'd do that, I'd react by deliberately confusing them by talking pretentiously, like an Ivy League professor).

bS5cGrVgaa	YES! that happens to me all the time! Like if i have a dream that a co-worker went on a killing spree murdering people with a chainsaw, then i avoid them until it wears off because everytime i see them i get a flashback of the dream. And also i had a dream that i went on a date with my boss and we were all kissy...then i was all bashful around him for a while. It eventually wears off but for a couple weeks it effects my view. I also always tell the person about it which helps sometimes! Sometimes i'll have dreams that my hubby was cheating on me and i wake up mad at him for like 5 minutes until i realize it was just a dream!|`|gVQ6es5Taa	I dreamt my boyfriend cheated on me, and I couldn't help feeling really upset and moody with him all day because it was so vivid lol!

FFAw1ozRaa	ANYTHING I do with my very best friend Chrissy, you might know her.<br>  <br>  and one time, I was at the movies with my best friend Kelsie, and we were in the movie theaters and it was completely empty, so we started running around like idiots, and then right before we started to sit down we noticed and old guy and his son or grandson or something was sitting there pretty much the entire time. it was so funny. <br>  <br>  and then me, Ashley,India and Josiah went to the mall for a feild trip and we were buying candy but we were running late for the bus so we ran all the way across the mall to the bus. I tripped when we passed victoria secret luckily I didn't fall. xD<br>  <br>  then this time, I went to this concert with my friend Chrissy and we were talking to this guy sitting next to us. then we screamed our heads off uncontrollably during slow songs... we were being idiots big time. then she drew a smily face on the back of my dads car. <br>  <br>  Then me and Kelsie broke a photobooth with a ticket from the school dance...<br>  <br>  then one time, at band camp... HAHA! JK! <br>  <br>  oh, and I was sitting in Target with Ashley and we were sitting in the spinny chairs and I turned away from Ashley in anger and the chair turned me back to face her I felt like an idiot because the girls sitting next to us got up laughing. lol. <br>  <br>  then one time, me and Justin and his friend Calvin were in Target and wanted to go buy a six pack of coke but instead Justin and him decided to have a door swinging contest and so they opened all the doors in the freezer section and jumped on them and tried to swing from one to the other, except for after one door they both fell off. <br>  <br>  then I was sitting in Target (a lot of things happen in Target) and me and Ashley were stalking this one cute guy and his mom in the power tools section.<br>  <br>  Than we were in Hottopic and this one old guy and his son were there and the son was REALLY cute and we poked him then ran off before he even noticed. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a retard... <br>  <br>  I've done worse with Chrissy though... <br>  like chewing cartoon brain bubblegum and ninja kicking store signs.|`|2XTkSV4daa	Well I know I've done more stupid things before...but whenever me and my sister and my friend go to the mall, we often get hyper (on root beer or ice cream or something) and so one day we ran almost screaming through the mall trying to high five our fingers we were so hyper. It was hilarious and now I look back at it and go wow.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	Oh God...I'm so glad im blonde so i can just blame the hair, because i have a never ending list.<br>  <br>  i spray painted the yellow road lines pink<br>  i drove over a tree at wallmart<br>  i forgot my money in my car, then once i went back in the store i forgot to grab what i bought<br>  i am basically a walking ditz sometimes.......|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I was in a hotel in Vegas and the heat was making my mother act irrational.

1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	They are movies created to entertain the masses not the true comic book readers. The first was ok, the second was horrible and the 3rd was actually decent. The only reason I go see them all is because of my teenage son. If it weren't for him, I'd wait for the DVD to come out.|`|3xXIKcMOaa	I LOVE the x-men movies. But I think that three is enough. I don't think it would be very wise to over play x-men and somewhat kill it, like they did with POTC.  Magneto is an orginal and pretty BA character. They're making a prequel movie for him this summer, like they are doing with wolverine.   No drama, nobody likes drama with action.|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	well i don't know much about the comics to say what should be in the movies and what they should take out but i did really like the movies and i'm really looking forward to X-Men Origins:Wolverine
1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	Ditto on  1. I fell asleep watching it.     2, talk about hype. I hate to say this but had Ledger not died the movie wouldn't of gotten the press it received. Sure he was good in the movie, but was he award worthy for that role? No!    If they make a  3, I'll watch it on DVD like I did the others.    Personally I don't know what the big deal is. Maybe another actor will die and make the next sequel just as hyped as the last. Its actually disgusting how a death makes a mediocre movie all of the sudden oscar worth.|`|FDt7cC8haa	I actually thought Batman Begins wasn't that bad, at least 3 out of 5 stars, perhaps you never saw, Superman Returns, that was a bad movie.....As far as other Comic Book Movies....Ironman, in my opinion was very well done....|`|3xXIKcMOaa	Haven't seen Batman Begins.  Dark Night WAS one of my favorites. Eventhough I'm more of an x-man fan. I'm giving props to Dark Night.  But The Shining but that movie to shame.    Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors I've seen.  That's where Heath Ledger got his general practice from, watching Nicholson..|`|jLvlcoFBaa	I didn't hate it but I didn't care for it. Have no desire to see it again.|`|AM33tqYAaa	i HATED the dark knight, too many special effects, Heath did a shi*ty job, Nickelson did better, the plot surrounded around a bank heist instead of going after the bad guy. the plot was crap, i want my 10 bucks back.    heath, if you can hear me, go back to Brokeback, ok?|`|LGidAYDwaa	I'm a Christian Bale fan. He's a much better actor than any of the previous campy Batman actors. (I mean, c'mon, Michael "Mr. Mom" Keaton, Val "I love myself more than anyone else" Kilmer, George "simply can't stop smiling" Clooney? Yikes.)    The first movie (Batman Begins) was more accurate to the original comics. The Dark Knight is spectacular. I felt Ledger did a heck of a job as the Joker. Certainly more dark and evil than Jack Nicholson's Joker, who was more of a joke than an evil nemesis.     There will be a Batman 3.|`|mpOGnr6vaa	"The Dark Knight" was vastly over rated and so was Heath Ledger's performance. He got sympathy points evidently. Jack Nicholson was much better as the Joker. I have a mind of my own, and I rarely agree with critics. No movie about comic book characters is a contender for the greatest film ever made.|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	Well i completly agree with you in the whole first film, i didn't really hate it but the begining was kind of slow. And i absolutly hate Maggie G , she is the worst they should've kept Katie Holmes, any way i won't get into that. Dark Knight is really fantastic admire Ledgers' performance and i think he should win the Oscar. As far as a third movie goes i don't think they should do it because it won't live up to Dark Knight and it will ruin it also. But the movie was freckin awesome and absolutly amazing|`|jcyc5juFaa	i love the dark knight man :)

CvtDsOB4aa	HaHA! <br>  Good  Point|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...Its supposed to detract them from your house if they are looking for targets...If they think someone is home, they don't want to risk getting caught...Duh...<br>  <br>  Next time you want to meet Mr. Burglar, feel free to keep all the lights off and be completely silent...and when you're away, don't leave anything on...<br>  <br>  Let us know how that works out for you...|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Most robbers have some common sense, and do not visit houses that are occupied at the time being. They strike when all of the lights are out and it looks like nobody is home. Say you were home, and a robber was downstairs, while you were upstairs. If you knew they were there and were to start singing, then they'd think, crap, somebody's home, and leave. Those are the ones using common sense, though. It is a good idea to turn lights and such on. Although you're right, if the robber is a psycho, you're screwed.|`|COJNlF4paa	I think they do it, so there are no dark corners where the robbers can hide. And if the lights are on, chances are, robbers won't come to an occupied house unless they want to kill someone.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	I guess because it makes a robber think that someone is still up.<br>  <br>  Robbers are more likely to break into a house when everyone is asleep.|`|DNknBxRWaa	i turn the lights on so i can see them and they dont sneak up on me...|`|MYfqL2Coaa	no, but it gives us peace of mind, its the normal thing you do. we, as humans have a natural fear of the unknown. we cannot know what we cannot see and so the dark frightens us. this is why we turn all the lights on, to illuminate the world around us and make the unknown, known.|`|w1HWJqFnaa	The lights are just to inform the burglar that you are home and alert. What kind of idiot would rob a house with people that are awake and aware? The T.V. just serves as a kind of distraction from your anxiety.|`|RIzXfftVaa	lol thts true xD|`|w6tQEuKCaa	..LOL>.when i get paranoid i just get my cross ,start sayin jesus.and go in my room

That's a nice thing you did for him by the way.|`|KVzBqWhvaa	Because it's not often that someone will do something really nice for another, so maybe he was kind of surprised and thought maybe you wanted something in return.

But of course you didn't do anything wrong.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	In this case scenario, I second Scooter on chances are he just wanted to return a favor.

Especially if he's shy around you =)|`|m0tTmKoLaa	no offence but i don't think he likes you at all<br>  because if he did then y does he hug the others a lot, and not you? <br>  and the whole "tries to hold your hand" thing he's probably just a flirt when everyone else is busy, he comes to you because your still on his 'list' but further down then the others.<br>  has he ever done this stuff with "the other girls" around?<br>  but if you want to "have a go at him" then do it, just prepare for the worst!

Turn back and evaluate the situation - again, still walking. If I decide he's a threat* I review the self-defence strategies and prepare myself to use them as the situation may demand.<br>  <br>  It should be noted however, that (at least in Canada, and - I think - the US) if you're a woman it's not super likely to be attacked by a random stranger on the street. Women, when attacked,  tend to get attacked in homes (and other 'familiar' places, like work) and usually by someone they know. Men, on the other hand, when attacked tend to be attacked by random strangers on the street.<br>  <br>  *could be I just discovered he's my neighbour, so should be heading in the same direction|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	Dude!!! that just happened to me last night! <br>  <br>  Im walking home, it's night time, and this guy is a little bit behind me. I'm getting suspicious, so i cross the street, <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and then HE CROSSES THE STREET!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm like, Holy Shiit, i'm about to die!!! So i start walking faster, and then HE STARTS WALKING FASTER! Now i'm getting really scared and now i'm thinking i'm really about to die. I'm looking for my cell phone in my pocket but i can't find it. So i'm cursing my dumbass out for thinking i left my cell phone at home because i don't remember having it with me all day.<br>  <br>  So now, I'm nearing my house, but i don't want him to know where i live so i kinda slow up and wait for him to pass me. He's literally walking maybe two steps behind me by now. So i turn around, prepared for death, and he says, "Miss, you dropped your phone back there.."<br>  <br>  -_-'<br>  <br>  <br>  I was like, "haha thanks", when in my head im thinking "wtf dude, you couldn't have yelled out instead of creeping up on me?!?!"<br>  <br>  I think he wanted me to be scared and im sure he's having a good laugh where ever he is. <br>  <br>  LOL that jackass.|`|3Nrb2CBXaa	well, for starters I wouldn't run because I'm not too fast and then he would know I was scared. So i'd probably be scared out of my mind but i'd try and act brave and keep walking, just a little faster. Then i'd get my phone out and maybe act a little insane and start singign loud or something, then maybe he'll just think i'm cazy and i'd find the closest place around to go to.|`|YvOm6u65aa	Put my keys between my fingers so I can stab him if necessary. Won't hurt him that much but at least it could be some sort of an effect.<br>  <br>  And just keep walking slowly and pretend I don't see him. Walk towards a public building or if it's isolated then try as quick as possible to get near a house or something.|`|uD9vEwP3aa	Turn, and see if he continues to follow me. And if he does, call the police without him knowing and walk a little quicker to get home.|`|YX1ddnXmaa	I'd keep an eye on that situation, yes sir I would.|`|KTtLYrcZaa	i would run away or if i think i can take him then id fight him..|`|oDL02s8kaa	run!!!|`|tLVZXLRSaa	That's actually happened to me before. But he turned when I crossed the street. I was just being paranoid but I just took out my cellphone and had a number to dial incase he got closer.|`|y29vSr4Zaa	Wait for a second then punch the guy in the face and RUN!|`|fFJUeDkbaa	turn around and ask him if he wants to come home with me.|`|QX2fP3Cbaa	turn around and hit him with something i randomly picked up|`|3urQfMffaa	walk faster and call the cops on my celly.|`|AUxHmud6aa	sneakily take my mase out of my purse and continue walking until said man is gone.....|`|Tmumq7T0aa	run and call my parents.|`|mpUKce9zaa	ahahaha the piggy is funny......<br>  <br>  I'd haul A$$....either that or turn around and say...How u doin'?|`|VNum3TKyaa	I would walk faster and try to keep an eye on him to make sure he can't surprise me and I would try to go where ever there is people if he tried anything I'd kick him in the balls and then i'd run like hell.|`|WTf21t9Jaa	Speedwalk and get my perfume out of my bag, and possibly my keys(great weapons!)

nOFvdF9yaa	It's No.2 to me i.e. the great writers/poets. I know the answer from a religious preacher & that is: God made some persons' heart so soft! I can guess an answer from a psychologist what would be so psychological that my stupid brain wouldn't understand. And those philosophers? They would place different kinds & types of opinions by different philosophers! That would rather confuse me! Only the writers & poets can explain, understanding the standard of his/her readers, in such a lucid way, that even if they used false examples or untrue things, I would believe them & would be satisfied. That's the power of ink (pen) I suppose.<br>  p.s. good question!|`|WQvDIhmgaa	3) Psychologist|`|OLcXtWQyaa	2) Great Poets

iCqfmRC3aa	We raised our family in a clothing optional house, so not only do I not care, its a fact that they all have seen me naked. Many times.  <br>  <br>  My kids are grown and gone now, but we still get together from time to time with their families at a clothing optional resort. ... all except for my middle son (we call him God-boy) He doesn't have a problem with us being nudists types, but doesn't want to participate anymore.  He does stay at our cabin at the resort during fishing trips, but doesn't go down to the pool or hot tubs :)  Oh, well it gives us good conversation regarding christianity and nudism.

ERxADoBAaa	No , I don't think it's true. The line might be that we take those we love for granted, therefore easily using them as scapegoats and soundng boards.|`|tFGMfDthaa	You can feel it. You love someone and they say or do something so bad that you hate them for it. One minute you love them and one minute you hate them. There's that thin line.  <br>  <br>  I have never crossed that line. It usually takes me a while to decide how I feel about someone and although someone may disappoint me and make me sad, it takes a lot for me to actually hate someone.|`|NQIKCGgfaa	That quote is understandable because both are intense all consuming emotions.<br>  <br>  That said I really doubt that I would love someone that I hate. I don't hate anyone but if I were to say I hate a person I assure you there is no way there is any love between me and that woman. Lol. So thatks my take.|`|8q5SeYueaa	Because love can quickly turn to hate if one has been hurt by the person they love.|`|UwA68EJWaa	friendship wise i have i hate this one kid he hated me  a month later we came great friends.  Couldn't really explain it.|`|145f9a95b73fc930d5481d771b203c24aa	its not that thin!|`|da08c0a16bc5a9f1f06ee85cc6158badaa	because you can fall in love with someone, and then get hurt by them. You want to let them go because you hate that they hurt you, but you hate to leave them because at some point you fell in love with them.|`|cNdkNYKOaa	everyone who has been in a relationship that went bad has crossed that line<br>  you can so passionately and deeply love someone and then sooo fully despise being near them<br>  why its true idk, but i have experienced this a few times|`|II0y24f1aa	were u listening to the diary of jane?<br>  there's also a thin line between genius & insanity & I have erased that line|`|g0evAXSGaa	i can feel the line<br>  and ohhhhhhhhhhh yeaah|`|kDab6zpTaa	i live on that line.|`|JCVs8W6raa	Who told you this.

JYeIPZ0jaa	Invest in property and sell by 2008 or<br>  <br>  Wear sunscreen.<br>  <br>  If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.<br>  <br>  Do one thing every day that scares you.<br>  <br>  Sing.<br>  <br>  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.<br>  <br>  Floss.<br>  <br>  Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.<br>  <br>  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.<br>  <br>  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.<br>  <br>  Stretch.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.<br>  <br>  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.<br>  <br>  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.<br>  <br>  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.<br>  <br>  Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.<br>  <br>  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.<br>  <br>  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.<br>  <br>  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.<br>  <br>  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.<br>  <br>  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble, and children respected their elders.<br>  <br>  Respect your elders.<br>  <br>  Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.<br>  <br>  Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.<br>  <br>  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.<br>  <br>  But trust me on the sunscreen.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	I think I just fell in love with Nosey Farker.|`|3SFxfoHEaa	i would say don't worry about your mother it's her problem not yours. and you won't repeat the things that happened to you. and no, you won't ever marry george michael. and don't give 'it' to a boy with a perm that looks like he has robbed a poodle.|`|pTmUycXzaa	I'd save my breath.

AkCY6rVWaa	If that ever happened, at the beginning, everyone would think that ok since it's legal then I should go and have some. Then later on it will die out and be less popular then ever because people usually go after these kinds of things because they are illegal. But even though drugs would be less popular in the END, the beginning will be an absolute disaster.|`|FoIxsunVaa	When alcohol was legalized again, many of the laws now in place didn't then exist. People went a little wild and we have struggled to rein in that monster ever since. If we are inept about legalization, things could get really ugly. If we create cogent laws, it would be a better world.|`|YmtNel5haa	To be quite frank, I think it should be legalized and monitored.<br>  It's hard to say exactly what the effects would be.  Would the world be loaded with addicts?  or would people be wanting to be less rebellious now that it had been legalized?  They could tax and regulate it.  At least people would know what they are getting and so there would be less of those kind of deaths.  Plus think about all the money that the government uses on "the war on drugs" that could go to other things, like our gaping debt.|`|2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	Well for one, thousands of people would lose there jobs, cause with no more war on drugs, means no more drug enforcement agency.  I think it would have the same effect that it does in Amsterdam.  It would make drugs uncool.|`|AA11609168	not much<br>  <br>  the people who use now would continue to, the people who dont might try somethings but I dont anyone is going to say "wowo heroin is legal so I should do it'<br>  <br>  <br>  We would $$ by having fewer prisoners|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Taxing that would probably be WAY more effective than that stupid stimulus bill|`|AMFajJCgaa	I would go skint.|`|WQvDIhmgaa	I really don't think that legalizing drugs would have a huge affect on society...I mean think about there would be so many regulations in place.  For example,  it's common knowledge that tetrahydrocannabinol is what gets marijuana smokers high, I lost my train of thought so guess what f you...Oh ya people would still go to dealers because the potency of the government monitored narcotics would be a lot less....|`|BVaCJkxzaa	There would be many more people without jobs because they can't pass drug tests at work. There would be many crimes due to the need to buy more drugs. There would be stoned people laying on the sidewalks as you tried to go out and enjoy your day. I can see nothing good coming from this.|`|iA5kZv15aa	England would become a nation of junkies rather than a nation of alcoholic binge drinkers like we are now|`|e1d6d765af7c1e2f2329bce5ce574c4baa	i would eat xanax like crazy and all the crazy people wouldnt irritate me anymore|`|II0y24f1aa	It wouldn't change much|`|cBxG0BbZaa	who knows

She tried nail polish remover, gasoline, plain old soap and everything she could think of. It just had to wear off. The formula has been changed since so it isn't quite so bad. I have seldom chewed the stuff since then so no more big bubbles.

vsy4QMHMaa	Ground Bass  music  also called basso ostinato (Italian: obstinate bass)  Main    in music, a short, recurring melodic pattern in the bass part of a composition that serves as the principal structural element. Prototypical instances are found in 13th-century French vocal motets as well as in 15th-century European dances, where a recurrent melody served as a cantus firmus, or fixed theme. With the rise of idiomatic instrumental music in the 16th century, the practice of improvising or composing new melodies above a repeated bass pattern became widely popular, especially in music for the lute and guitar (especially in Italy, England, and Spain) and harpsichord (especially in England); this practice, known in Spanish music as diferencias and elsewhere in Europe as divisions, is an early manifestation of the technique of theme and variations.    Some familiar ground bass patterns, or grounds, came to be identified by name. One favourite dance, the bergamasca, used a simple ground built on the scale degrees I-IV-V-I in two bars (as, for example, in Ottorino Respighis Ancient Dances and Airs, Suite 2 (1923). Other well-known grounds, such as the passamezzo antico, romanesca, folia, ruggiero, and passamezzo moderno, took their names from dances that were popular throughout Europe. All such grounds used unchanging harmonic patterns (each note of the ground serving as the basis for a different chord) that in turn served as an essential framework for improvisation. The familiar folk song "Greensleeves" has often been arranged with either the passamezzo antico or the closely related romanesca as a harmonic bass.    In the Baroque era the melodic basso ostinato became incorporated into more rigorously structured forms of continuous variation, such as the chaconne and passacaglia. Some examples are Claudio Monteverdi, Zefiro torna (1614); Henry Purcell, "When I Am Laid in Earth" from Dido and Aeneas (first performed 1689); Johann Sebastian Bach, Cantata No. 78 ("Jesu, der du meine Seele"), Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor for organ (170817) and "Chaconne" from Partita in D Minor for solo violin (1720); Ludwig van Beethoven, 32 Variations in C Minor (first performed 1806); Johannes Brahms, Variations on a Theme by Haydn (1873); and Alban Berg, Altenberg Lieder, Opus 4, No. 5 (1912). Bachs famous Aria with 30 Variations (1742), called Goldberg Variations, is based on a 32-bar harmonic bass pattern that is slightly varied at each repetition but conserves its essential outline throughout the work.    Compositions called carillon used a melodic ostinato, not necessarily in the bass, to suggest a repeating peal of bells; for example, the carillon in Georges Bizets lArlsienne (1872) has a three-note ostinato. In the 20th century, ostinato patterns became widely used in jazz (notably in forms such as 12-bar blues and boogie-woogie).    (Mark DeVoto)|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Mike: Ostinato and grounds are not the same!|`|5xS7sQOgaa	Ground bass or basso ostinato (obstinate bass) is a type of variation form in which a bassline, or harmonic pattern (see Chaconne) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations. Aaron Copland[2] describes basso ostinato as, "the easiest to recognize" of the variation forms wherein, "a short phraseeither an accompanimental figure or an actual melodyis repeated over and over again in the bass part, while the upper parts proceed normally [with variation]." However, he cautions that, "it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form."

15378d2134926b92f92f581f333d95dfaa	I have my B.A. and M.A. in Public Relations.  I worked as Foster and Adoption Recruiter for 3 years which was an awesome job and I got a decent salary.  Now I work in Public Relations for a major hospital and I get paid $63,000.00 a year.  Not bad for now, but the possibilities are endless.  I heard all of the same negativity when I chose my major, but now all of my friends envy my job positions.  I don't have the average job and I am always involved in something social and charitable.  I'm always networking.  I was approached recently for a job at a local newspaper making about $75,000.00 a year.  The only thing is that I love my current job and I couldn't beat the flexibility I have with a stick.  As an example, I'm at work but yet I'm on here answering your question.  LOL!

Tune it for whatever pitch you want. <br>  <br>  reso - Single ply with a 4" port. 5" max. Tune it low tension for a thud with not much sustain. Tune it higher and you have some boom and sustain. While you want a good thud, you may want to tune higher for some sustain if you're in a band setting. <br>  <br>  muffling - Small towel folded. each end touching the batter and reso head, with a little more touching the reso head.

iFTa9FqZaa	well my favorite one is kind of like a flowerish thing split in half, like a circle but with circles going around the outside with the letters best friends and split with a thunder bolt type thing, i have the 'best' half, but its not only my favorite because of the design...it was given to me by my best friend when we were 7, a month before I moved 600 miles away.|`|95uXmC94aa	I would say a plain simple heart with maybe initials or a special message/saying you two or three have!|`|TApVoMdAaa	None, but I found a Hannah Monntana one a little girl lost once.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	im not a girl|`|qzkWahFeaa	Either the hearts, or ones that are cute like these: <a href="http://www.violetgumdrop.com/images/thumbs/apbjvioletgumdrop071.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.violetgumdrop.com/images/thum...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.violetgumdrop.com/images/thumbs/extrasmmilkvioletgumdrop075.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.violetgumdrop.com/images/thum...</a><br>  <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/myjewelbox/bfriend2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/myjewelbo...</a><br>  <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317V7JrruML._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31...</a>|`|c8HHi3Wqaa	I've always been a fan of the pearl necklace.

One of the best movies ever.|`|bQh43Gtpaa	I know plenty. Or at least, I think they're good.<br>  1. Serendipity: This movie is so fun. It's not really a 'chick flick' but it's a romantic comedy. Just a more serious one.<br>  2. Another Cinderella Story: This is a teen movie and a romantic comedy. Bonus: it's a musical (at least I consider it a bonus)<br>  3. The Cutting Edge: Going For the Gold. It's the sequel to The Cutting Edge, but really the first one isn't as good, and watching the second one first isn't confusing at all. (I did that, bot realizing it was a sequel.)<br>  4. Chasing Liberty: This is also a really fun, romantic comedy. A bit of a chick-flick, but not entirely.<br>  5. Win A Date With Tad Hamilton: This movie is really funny, a romantic comedy and I love it. Also a bit of a chick flick, but not especially.<br>  6. She's The Man: It's a modern-day version of Twelfth Night. It's hilarious, and a romantic comedy.<br>  7. The Sisterhood Of the Traveling Pants (both): They're not complete romantic comedies, but I love them, they're really good movies and there is romance.<br>  I think that's about it.. hope this helps!

AA11193401	it did look like him|`|AA11089846	Shows no respect for the leader of our country and stereotypes him. Our country has freedom of speech and freedom of the press but you know I can think of at least 6 countries where this cartoon would have meant a long jail term, if nothing else and/or the newspaper wouldn't even have been allowed to post such a picture.|`|w1HWJqFnaa	Well, it is a SHOT monkey and you know how everyone has a suspicion that Obama could be assassinated. However, I don't think the artist should be punished because he is within his rights to freedom of speech.|`|cNdkNYKOaa	the only difference is the media likes obama<br>  they hated bush<br>  you could print anything bad about bush and its ok<br>  but the minute you think about dissing obama its a federal crime|`|yGQgdYNwaa	Being that "monkey" has been used to wrongly describe African Americans, I find it extremely offensive.|`|jMAn10NOaa	i don't think anything of it. haven't seen it/don't want to see it. any kind of politics puts me to sleep.|`|C1fBdw95aa	I think it's kinda funny to be honest, but that's not the point here because it was NOT making fun of Obama, it was directed at Congress|`|hZ9omSataa	ha ha, I just sent as a comment to my friends on Myspace!!!  They have a sense of humor that most of America is lacking in...|`|WFgO7xcUaa	A Majority of people are sensitive to racism nowadays since we have our first black president.<br>  <br>  I don't know if the Political cartoonist meant that to be racist, I think he was just trying to relate the Bill being written by people "out of their minds"(Congress), just like the chimp was, because he does not agree with the bill.<br>  BUT<br>  The average american thinks that the president basically wrote the bill and saw the political cartoon shooting him. Yes he signed for it..but if he didn't he would betray his whole party (slapping the hand that feeds him). <br>  I'm sure the cartoonist knows that congress wrote the bill...but I'm also sure that he knew that chimps+blackpresident+political cartoon= people getting mad thinking you are making fun of our new Black President. I blame him for not thinking twice.|`|tVS4gTHzaa	Did I miss something?  When did the President start writing legislation?  I thought Congress wrote the bill and the chimp cartoon is a comment on them, not President Hussein.  As such, there isn't anything racist about comparing Congress to a chimp since both are capable of producing legislation of this quality.|`|rZiwsEdYaa	Yeah it's stupid, just drop it. There are people dying for christ sake.  Freedom of Press!! who cares.|`|bz3qRdpraa	dont know|`|lLN8VD20aa	we called Dubya a monkey because he kinds looked like one.<br>  <br>  I object to the "DEAD ... by shooting" issue.<br>  <br>  That's all.   the violence.<br>  <br>  If you don't like the stimulus bill ... take revenge on who wrote it  ... the Congress & Senate.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	All such cartoons should be banned, no matter who they portray. They are cruel & nasty.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I think that historically us being called "monkeys" is why it hits a nerve.  Take the phase "porch monkeys".  We have been called that and it wasn't a term of endearment.|`|snjdyvlmaa	Well, my dear, there is a difference.  Bush had the mentality of a chimp.  Obama does not.  <br>  <br>  Not so funny.  You should know that.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	its just a publicity ploy,i do not think it is offensive,it has more to do with the term monkey business|`|BhQSTvLsaa	I agree with slutty pineapple.
njjj4zljaa	freakin' obama-maniacs|`|gYkpyCb0aa	This is not a good example of a lack of freedom of speech. <br>  <br>  The Times faced no legal action for their cartoon; their freedom was not encroached upon. <br>  <br>  Their readers faced no legal action for protesting the cartoon; their freedom wasn't encroached upon either. <br>  <br>  "Freedom of Speech" does not mean that people cannot vocally disagree with you.|`|gbeTKHYkaa	too long for P&S!

Personally I am not usually attracted to asians. That's just me. However I know many girls (ones who arent asians as well) who have gone out with asian guys so they obviously found them attractive.<br>  <br>  Maybe the reason I am not usually attracted to asian guys is because they tend to be shorter than me, and I've lived most of my life in Asia so I'm so used to them as well. The guy in the picture would be a 6-7 to me. He is a fairly good looking guy.|`|AvqQt5zNaa	7.

Men that commit this type of crime are doing it because they want control over you, they don't only do it for sexual gratification. But find enjoyment over the terror and humiliation they put there victims through. They usually pick women who they feel they can manhandle and intimidate. This usually means they want someone lighter and weaker than themselves. If you are close to their weight or over their weight... they will pass you buy for easier pickings. They will not risk their own safety to... even if they were sexually attracted to you. (Equally if you were not fat and 6'9" 180 lbs weight lifter with the body of an Olympic god... I don't think they will rape her unless she has some serious self esteem issues, that really show in her mannerisms.)|`|064317bad909409f737c645b24ec5ae2aa	They do. Rapists are monsters.

36vTK4Enaa	Dude, I can't believe you didn't see that coming, that was just silly of you.  I'm not surprised that the teacher and your mom laughed too.  Any boy who stands still and lets a girl kick him in the balls pretty much deserves what he gets - goodness knows you will get racked enough times in your life without standing still and letting some girl do it.  It is perfectly natural for girls to want to explore the male body in this way and to express their feelings by aiming for your sensitive parts.  And the way you boys react is so funny you can hardly blame them for laughing.  I say you shouldn't be so uptight about it, just loosen up and go with the flow.  Let us girls have our fun!|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Take this as a learning experience and guard your boys next time. <br>  <br>  Personally I would only kick a guy there if I needed to (i.e. he intended to harm me and it was to protect myself).
luVK5cHqaa	No kids for you!|`|2LpWgU20aa	i'm sorry, but that story made me giggle. idk, but that really mean of girls to kick boys in the balls! maybe they dont understand how much that hurts! perhaps u should let them know?|`|YW1DXceqaa	if that happened to me just hit em in the hooters...see if the still think it's funny|`|AA11886102	No, it's not funny and I wouldn't let it slide if I was the one racked.  Not only did the one who actually rack you commit a battery offense (assault), but the teacher failed to report it - she had a duty to either report it to school officials or to the police, or to both.  <br>  <br>  I would be marching my angry butt into the principal's office to report the teacher and the two girls who did it and start threatening to call child protective services if they don't do anything about it.|`|plVoWHSoaa	rofl thats a really good idea =D <br>  yeah you should there is no reason to get pissed off about it but dont like let it happen on purpose not if you can help it because it might stop you from having kids in the future =]|`|PclzbI1naa	Lol hell no thats stupid<br>  If I ever kick someone in the balls I'll give them permission to kick me right back.<br>  <br>  Aw thats rly sad :(<br>  Crap school that you're at if that's what the teachers do|`|zZv4yYazaa	Well I think the girl that kicked you was kidding But girls kid around. :)|`|49gugL8maa	Yeah. They don't understand, and some of my less chivalrous friends hit em in the boobs after they do this, decent payback I say.|`|F6g2iH78aa	aww im sorry!<br>  i don't do that, i would feel really bad.|`|7e1ecec78582cdcc16130e5eb539f133aa	Dan, you were assaulted.  Worse, a teacher witnessed the assault and did nothing. Funny? Not at all.  Here's what I suggest you do:<br>  <br>  Call the police and report the assault.  I don't care if you're six years old or your mom thinks this is funny, just do it.  Ask the dispatcher to send an officer to your home, that you wish to file a report.  Tell them basically what you posted here, and -- this is important -- be sure to give the police officer the name of the teacher who witnessed the assault and did nothing.<br>  <br>  Next, go to your principal and tell him/her you were assaulted by another student, you reported it to the police, and give the principal the name of the teacher who did nothing.<br>  <br>  At the very least, you deserve a straight-faced apology from that teacher. I bet you'll get one.

AA12145054	The Atari 2600 is a video game console released in October 1977. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and cartridges containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the Fairchild Channel F. However the Atari 2600 is credited with making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public.<br>  <br>  Originally known as the Atari VCS — for Video Computer System — the machine's name was changed to "Atari 2600" (from the unit's Atari part number, CX2600) in 1982 following the release of the more advanced Atari 5200. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a cartridge game—initially Combat and subsequently Pac-Man.<br>  <br>  The Atari 2600 was wildly successful. During the 1980s, "Atari" was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games in general, similar to "Nintendo" and "PlayStation" in the later 1980s and '90s.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Some video game shops sell "retro" games equipment - you posh devil with your atari.  My cousin had one.<br>  We had the spectrum 48k, and it took what seemed like a year to load a game from a tape, crackling, spitting and beeping, and sometimes, it froze and didn't load - lol.<br>  We still thought it was the greatest technological advancement on earth, I remember boasting about having certain games at school.<br>  You can definitely buy a proper atari from "game" or "ebay".  They're not cheap, but you will have more fun than you have had in years.<br>  Totally agree with the 1st person, retro gaming was better!!|`|sXNtTETbaa	i used to have an atari 2600, with 32 games built in to one cartridge, a joystick with a red button. oh the memories!!|`|iA5kZv15aa	I had one!<br>  I still argue that although the graphics are better these days the games are not as addictive

sUgrGy78aa	yup did diool|`|IsZ8qFRNaa	it depends, if Brian told john that sarb is a word because he truly thought it was then it is not a matter of "sticking up" but a matter of the truth<br>  <br>  but if Brian told john that sarb is a word because he wanted to spite him then he did not stick up for john|`|HqwO5LZaaa	The letter that I get back from the medical school I applied to will determine that.|`|ENAEcBOmaa	i think i am smart.<br>  no he did not.<br>  no, and stick up is a term/ figure of speech, not a word|`|zuyrHoc9aa	I think I'm somewhat smart.|`|C5QV222iaa	nope, sarb is not a word, and idk what stick up would be but it doesnt seem like it, so no to both|`|RaLiLTT9aa	Not really. Just going along with the conversation on my opinion, but, I won't be suprised if I end up wrong....|`|pK7saLw4aa	I DONT KNO IM TOO STUPID!!!!|`|II0y24f1aa	Omfg ! that hurts my brain I refuse to finish reading it|`|SnTBokvyaa	Well i sure am smart enough not to waste my time on this stupid question :P|`|Orx9cTJJaa	No. He did what he was told.

(While I was typing this word, the "Spell Checker underlined the word sarb in red."<br>  <br>  I think that they are no longer friends since you said- Bob, Kyle, John, and Brian "were" friends. You didn't type "are", so I assume that they are not friends.|`|dhj3ynjeaa	no, brian didn't stick up for john at all...cuz he lied and said "sarb" IS a word. <br>  <br>  and sticking up to someone is when you defend them or something. so, no.|`|g0evAXSGaa	no<br>  no|`|AX7IOl2Gaa	yes and yes|`|YnBdka6naa	I'm pretty smart. Lol<br>  <br>  "Stick up" is two words btw. =]|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	I Think I Am :S|`|aDG8EteIaa	No, because sarb isn't a word|`|1YTmgAc3aa	after having fail attempts to answer this question..I have realized that I am stupid..<br>  <br>  <br>  thank you for lowering my self esteem
AA11313798	she's selfish. aside from the reason y everyone's mad.. cuz of government assistance..<br>  <br>  but the real reason she's selfish is cuz she's wants what she wants...but have3nt given any thoughts to her kids. she had 6 kids already, 3 with disabilities. yet she brought more. <br>  <br>  there's no way that she can fully give the right amount of parenting and love to those children. <br>  <br>  and to think she's a child psychology major. horrible.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	I think the gov't should determine how many children you are allowed to have because that woman cannot support that many children financially.    I can't afford to have my own so why should my hard earned tax money support her children|`|6b7773b52762fcb851c58734843a6589aa	I think the Right To Lifer's should be rallying behind her, give her their full support, and make her their poster child.|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Freak, piece of **** of a woman. Using OUR tax dollars to pay for her freakin wii games and nails and MAC makeup, after spending TONS of money on in vitro and plastic surgery.<br>  <br>  They need to take the kids away from that nutjob and give them to families that will really love them.|`|IizPFrELaa	She got her 15 minutes of fame!<br>  <br>  The more we feed into her the more money she's gonna make, NOT FAIR!<br>  <br>  I have lots of compassion for those innocent babies she has, but she's down right unstable and needs to seek help!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	She's crazy.  She's irresponsible.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	only in America|`|vWEkopBQaa	She is moving on up by scamming.<br>  Child Protective Services should start a massive investigation on her. She should have to account for every penny giving to her for the care of all the children. She should be forced to prove she can care for the physical needs children on her own with out help of Nanny's. She should be forced to have mental testing to prove she is mentally stable.<br>  <br>  I personally think she is a fruit cake.|`|XCn2dK1laa	Since we're footing her hospital bills,i think we should get a say in how she uses her money. I think if she's going to be looking into a million dollar house,then she'd better make room for the taxpayers too.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	she shouldn't have had those last babies.  I think she did it just for the attention.  the Dr shouldn't have done it.|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Ive been listening to 92.3 KTAR about it. I think she should spend her money on other things than her personal stuff.|`|AA12382198	She's got mental problems.....and it seems no one has ever put their foot down and told her NO!!!!<br>  <br>  So now there are 14 children who will suffer.<br>  <br>  She's a very strange strange lady.|`|064317bad909409f737c645b24ec5ae2aa	She deserves those death threats.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	It's a vagina, not a clown car!|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Sew it shut!|`|drfwOQNIaa	w/e.<br>  people are going to constantly be saying they HATE her. but seriously.. nobody knows her. she obviously does need help and a wake up call..<br>  but i think ppl r saying too much about her. she's made mistakes.. she's not the only one who milks the government. there are worse ppl.<br>  <br>  everybody struggles in life. our economy is a piece of crap now and it's just going down the drain. ONE woman doesnt make a difference. it's everyone. <br>  power to her.. and her kids. i hope everything is sorted out.|`|08s03qFGaa	I think that, personally people are just freaking out waaay too much about it all and that they need to realize that she has 8 KIDS! and that children are so beautiful and im sure that no one would want to be born into this world and feel unwanted!|`|wpNQLLyOaa	my opinion is to complicated. I don't really agree with ivf to begin with. but as for the whole welfare thing i don't care if she is on it or not|`|T6OorlmZaa	She's a selfish cow......and a major reason why our country is in the shape it's in.

I can see THAT in him lol.<br>  I doubt he is seriously. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: WHAT? I don't like Katy Perry. Katy's too shallow.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	where in the world did u hear that? thats soooo not true! lol|`|QKLFoebqaa	I doubt they are atm. They just met through a mutual friend and she has openly admitted she finds him attractive.

y4QbrTItaa	I see nothing wrong with it.|`|R6pfYeioaa	I'm sure the cannibals didn't think it was wrong to eat both parents and their offspring even though that was totally sadistic, taboo, immoral, satanic, evil and psychotic.|`|qicRLHMLaa	No, I have eaten Fried rice with chicken and I have eaten balute.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	No<br>  <br>  No|`|AA11609168	to fry chicken I dip the chicken in eggs and flour to fry it it|`|njjj4zljaa	not as immoral as killing a cow and feeding it to other cows|`|ZfqKbAB8aa	I think its a little gross.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Immoral, no.  But you should let one of the eggs turn into a chicken, before you eat the first chicken, so you can have more eggs for later - and a backup chicken.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I never thought about it that way....and I hope I forget.  I eat chicken in my omelets all the time.  So I guess I'm immoral.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	No I don't. Take chicken noodle soup. It takes eggs to make the noodles. I've never felt bad for eating chicken noodle soup.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Immoral?? not unless you are an animal rights activist.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	no why would it be. that is just superstition. keep eating protein. it's good for you|`|hEAuWYYjaa	just eat it and be happy you have food and dont think if it came from the chicken your eating|`|MJyM1XWJaa	It'd be immoral to those who are vegan.|`|AA12046107	nope....sounds good to have scrambled eggs with diced chicken bits blended in.|`|y7lUgd3aaa	I think it's really wrong.  To me, animals and people are very similar.  Why should we be allowed to eat animals with no fuss but when an animal tries to eat a person we go berserk.  It's not fair|`|5Zcq3LXOaa	EAT THEM TOGHETHER<br>  infact, spread mayonaise|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	why would that be any different from eating them separate?|`|CuSvCNrpaa	you should always eat the egg first before you proceed to the chicken.|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Nothing wrong with that...|`|bFyPdIa5aa	NO
kiJ0rUrVaa	is nats like some animal that americans know about? because im british and i dont know what they are|`|aBpEPOCdaa	Put out a dish of vinegar...they'll be gone in no time...the nats I mean|`|PEz2YMeXaa	Nah<br>  <br>  They'll just confirm that you're a woman|`|3efVGK9Maa	once you tell them, no|`|8PO93dFZaa	no wayy|`|wpNQLLyOaa	eww nats. why would they think your crazy. your the only one that has witnessed these annoying things or what?|`|uQrIdrjfaa	who cares|`|56bNLJykaa	No (as in no they wont think you are crazy, not, no i cant help you)
COJNlF4paa	yes i do. all you want to do is get your question answered, but they have to just point out everything that's wrong with it.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	those people seriously need to realize who cares about some tiny little mistake??? nobody died rite?|`|CzK3NGZraa	haha.<br>  that can be annoying.<br>  <br>  i guess some people cant help, but be a walking dictionary.|`|4XaL68C4aa	You spelled "jerks" wrong, dumb@$$.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ;)|`|grifjdr0aa	No.  Jerks.|`|FgU7wYDSaa	i hate that<br>  they aren't jurks its just that if you can understand what im saying then leave it alone

ZP30wbvYaa	Wow, sounds like a great topic for a report. I haven't had any REALLY bad experiences, but I have been getting a lot of crap from twilighters at my school. I got up in front of the class and talked about why i disliked the books, how i thought that they were terribly written, and by the time that i had gotten back to my seat, almost every girl in the room was glaring at me. Next thing i knew, every girl in the school hates me and i am constantly being teased now. All because of a stupid book! good luck with the project.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	how is twilight dangerous. I've seen reports that physiologists have proved that harry potter is addictive. Studies haven't been to see if twilight is addictive so i think harry potter fans are worst then twilight fans.|`|OilQvoLZaa	Yes. They ruin everything about vampirism. Because now all those preppy imbeciles wants to be vampires. Twilight is the most horribly written book I have ever had the displeasure to read. How on earth it came to be published I will never know...|`|QWsnxVlYaa	Uh well <br>  I'm kinda obsessed<br>  very obsessed<br>  but...I never freak on anyone if they didn't like it though|`|GnJWVuqyaa	I dont happen to be a twilight fan. I used to but the movie and fan craze drove me insane so...........|`|PiFUVt8yaa	I happen to be someone who does not like the Twiilight series. No offense to people who do. I respect that.<br>  Anyways all my friends are obsessed with it and they were asking for my opinion. I blunty told them I didn't like the series and I gave constructive critisms about Stephenie Meyer's writing. So yeah my friends were mad at me for about 2 weeks and all the other fans didn't talk to me. Not really a bad experience, I thought it was funny.|`|eroEFDmfaa	They always thumb down my answers......they hate me XD|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I've had some people yell at me because I don't like Twilight. And one girl on Yahoo sent me hate mail...
FUZaH8Y1aa	I think its better if a guy looks in my eyes when talking because then at least you know hes paying attention, i dont know about making you more attractive but it makes us feel better because you seem interested, btw when i said dont know about making you more attractive i didnt mean that in a nasty way, its just when i read what i wrote it sounded like that lol:)|`|JBv7pwrHaa	Well maybe not stare... but yes, do look us in they eye. To me, that makes me feel more comfortable.|`|3oIcUB8Faa	Staring would be a little creepy, but looking deeply into their eyes is totally attractive.|`|Qbhuj5a3aa	It would only concern me if you were very very close as this is an intimidating look.<br>  I have been told that I talk with my eyes which can be a good and also unforgiving; as people can get my reaction without me speaking a word!|`|qcuXR1Msaa	Staring = creepy.<br>  Eye contact that isn't staring = good.|`|fwlToGUSaa	i would love it if you stared into my eyes.|`|ozCn1feYaa	yea. it shows interest.
pxhS7ol6aa	Totally. It's one of the most annoying things about the internet. And also people get pictures of pretty people and post them on their accounts saying they're friends. And they make up fake names and everything to make them look good.|`|NuCeBq4Jaa	just leave them alone its clearly those people have no life its either fake account making for them or suicide|`|II0y24f1aa	hahaha I've nvr heard of ppl doing that thx 4 the laugh|`|6ClURMmWaa	lol i know right.<br>  no life people<br>  haha.|`|xQ3q2PDmaa	no, i hate it when they use fake pictures of a really young person, that's not even them..|`|dqeOMqyPaa	so do i.|`|f2f1533543e03966253e5dfdc62b7b19aa	nver heard of tht|`|E5rhAaLGaa	you know what i hate?<br>  people who moan about stupid social sites.. i think someone  needs a lifee? =p
ZH4N6Xdtaa	herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, its very similar to having a cold sore but on your vagina/penis/anus area.|`|k39bNUgeaa	well that's a lie. Rihanna didn't give it to him. It's a lie people made up just to get attention<br>  <br>  But it's a sexually transmitted disease
PiLRsxtwaa	depends on how close together y'all houses are.|`|n4ITRmykaa	probly so.......|`|toLCaFc9aa	If they are too close together, yes.<br>  Also, if he finds out it was you, he would probably burn yours.
l1HhubCeaa	Like 7.5<br>  I'm vegetarian, anti war, walk to school/work, but I don't care for hippie music or fashion.|`|qQrsi8koaa	8, I'm a vegetarian and animal rights freak.

POXOqhOYaa	Hey Lizzy B. :)    I'd give Darker Then Black a try because it's actually a very interesting anime series that tends to suck you into the plot and as soon as you realize your addicted to it it's too late.    Anyway, here's a plot summary and some of the characters for you to read.    -Plot:  en years ago, an inscrutable and abnormal territory known as Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo and altered the sky and wreaked havoc on the landscape. The heavenly bodies disappeared, replaced by false stars. During this time, people who possess various special abilities emerged. Kept secret from the knowledge of the masses, these individuals, known as Contractors, are able to murder in cold blood. Various nations around the world use Contractors as spies and agents, often resulting in violent battles for information. Each fake star has a corresponding contractor, and they vibrate when their contractor's power is being used. As such, contractors are usually identified by their star's Messier catalogue number. However, their abilities are gained at the edge of their humanity. They are implied to lack human emotions which includes no aversions to murder, and they are regarded as extremely rational and logical in their decision making. Contractors are thus named because of their need to always complete a remuneration or payment each time their power is used (ie. eating flowers, breaking fingers, drinking blood). Contractors usually work for one of various rival Organizations as spies and assassins.    -Main Characters:    Hei, the main protagonist and an elite Contractor with the Messier Code BK-201. Hei plays a gentle-hearted student from China named Li Shengshun (Li Xiansheng [Han Yu Pinyin]or Li Sianshong [Tong Yu Pinyin], literally Mr. Li)But when undercover he becomes an apathetic and guiltless killer when on his missions. Joining an organization of unknown ambitions known only as the Syndicate, Hei is searching for the whereabouts of his sister Pai, whom he lost several years ago when the South American gate imploded. Hei's contract allows him to generate electricity, and he is hotly pursued by the Japanese government for his involvement in multiple assassinations. He acts as the spy/assassin of his team. Also, the real Messier object with number 102 (201 backwards) is unidentified and ambiguous, which contributes to the ambiguity that surrounds Hei in the minds of both his own comrades and the police.    Yin, a supporter in Hei's team. She is an emotionless spirit medium known as a "Doll". Very passive and speaking rarely, she is described as having no emotion and incapable of such processes (however as the series progresses she shows a slight human side with hints of emotion). Her primary function is to locate individuals, usually assassination targets, for the team. For this she uses her ability to see anything near water when she is touching water. Before the appearance of the Gates she lived in Finland as Kirsi (last name unknown) learning to play the piano under the tutelage of famed pianist Eelis Kostinen.  In the manga, she resembles Kanon since she is also a "doll".    If you want a place to watch it, this is a really good quality and free site that I use all the time.    http://www.rawranime.com/category/44/    I hope I helped and have a good day!

4P9no5CTaa	You share an ability to communicate, empathize and understand one another. Your conversations get better over time and so does the sexual relationship. There is an unspoken bond between Scorpio and Virgo that once established, will hardly ever be broken. Virgo is a keeper for sexy Scorpio and vice versa. You will provide each other with what the other person instinctively needs and desires sexually. Sexual and romantic compatibility will be volcanic. A strong friendship and loyalty will keep these two together. Scorpio must not play any head games with Virgo or there will be a serious price to pay. Virgo will help keep Scorpio grounded and healthy. The prognosis for a long-term love is excellent. Focus on healing yourselves and you both will have found a mate for life. Working out together would be a great aphrodisiac.|`|Fq8yzJamaa	Virgo Man & Scorpio Woman<br>  This is a good match that can definitely lead to long-lasting love with a little care. You and the Virgo boy match very well in personality, and you complement each other's styles. You will have excellent conversations together, and you'll find that you agree about many of the things that you think are important. You probably share many of the same values and opinions. He will be a little shy in the romance department. When it comes to physical stuff, he'll be happiest if you take the lead and set the pace... which is fine by you! This can be a good friendship as well as a love that builds and grows. Be careful of a tendency to get defensive, because he can be a little picky. But he doesn't mean anything by it, and if you can relax a bit and see the good in him, this can be a happy match for you.|`|BJfscj02aa	Nothing better than a Scorpio Woman!|`|FeRC5jkoaa	scorpio + virgo = love<br>  always been strong chemistry with a virgo males i've been attracted too.

64qRgtrBaa	There are no good recent horror films, the horror genre is a joke now. If you want something good you gotta go with the classics...<br>  <br>  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" - The original from 1974, not that lousy re-make. It's actually not as bloody as you might think, it has a very unsettling vibe throughout the whole film, very creepy.<br>  <br>  "The Exorcist" - This one scared me to death when I was a kid, and it's still pretty intense.  Much better than any of the sequels or prequels. "The Exorcism Of Emily Rose" lifted a lot of ideas from this movie.<br>  <br>  "Poltergeist" - While it has it's creepy moments, this one isn't as scary as much as it is an all-around great movie.<br>  <br>  "The Sixth Sense" - Again, not extremely scary, but it's creepy and it's got a great story with some great acting.<br>  <br>  "The Blair Witch Project" - If you have any kind of imagination, this one is very creepy. The unknown is the scariest thing to anyone, and this movie captured it perfectly.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend the original "Halloween" and the original "Nightmare On Elm Street."|`|b7hgwCfiaa	Hey!<br>  I watched a film recently--><br>  final destination<br>  <br>  its really good, gruesome, freaky and actually has a storyline (unlike some horror movies)!!<br>  <br>  There are 2 sequels-> final destination 2 & 3 , they are good too, very like the first one.<br>  <br>  I wont tell you the storyline, because i dont want to ruin it if you get it.<br>  Hope this helps, if your interested.<br>  <br>  xoxo gossip girl|`|2EobcGqqaa	I just recently watched Baby Blues.  It's based on the true story of Andrea Yates.  A mother who drowned her 4 kids in the bathtub. I thought it would be very B rated.  However, it has some excellent acting.  The woman's older son is the best actor.  He played the young Johnny Cash in "Walk the Line." It is super deranged if you're into that sort of thing. I am super sensitive when it comes to horror films with children in them.  I could only watch it half way through before I broke down and started crying. It's the only film I have ever done that with.  I heard "The Eye" was pretty good, as well.|`|Ek0eDO00aa	The Descent<br>  Audition - total headf***!!!<br>  <br>  If you like ghost ones - The Entity - made in 1980-something but it's really creepy.|`|uQDh86A1aa	Any of the Aliens series.

Its not scary as in ghost its more of a thriller. An ex spys daughter gets kidnapped and sold in prostitution he has to find her within 24 hours before he looses her forever to sex slavery. It might sound rubbish but it is one of the best movies i have ever seen.

pRa9VFTtaa	Renesmee Cullen<br>  Renesmee "Nessie" Carlie Cullen is the half-vampire, half-human daughter of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, born on September 10, three days before Bella's nineteenth birthday in Breaking Dawn. Her name is derived from the amalgamation of the names of Bella's mother, Renée, and Edward's adoptive mother, Esme. Her middle name, Carlie, is a combination of the names Carlisle, Edward's adoptive father, and Charlie, Bella's father. She has the same facial features and hair color as Edward, but the curly hair of her grandfather, Charlie Swan, and the brown eyes of Bella. She is described by Bella and Jacob as being the most beautiful person in the world, even though she is so young. Her heart pumps blood, giving her a blush, and her pale skin glows in the sunlight. Her skin is very warm and soft to the touch, but it is as strong as a vampire's. Renesmee can survive on either blood or human food, though she prefers blood, and she doesn't produce venom. Her special abilities are being able to show someone a thought by touching their skin, and penetrating mental shields. Renesmee grows both mentally and physically at an extremely fast rate, being able to speak only seven days after her birth, and by the end of Breaking Dawn she is able to read, run, hunt, and perform other tasks at advanced levels for her young age. Her intelligence stuns everyone - Bella and Edward especially - as she can understand what is going on around her when the Volturi arrive. Jacob Black gives her the nickname "Nessie" because he considers her full name to be a mouthful, though Bella strongly dislikes him nick-naming her child "after the Loch Ness Monster". However, by the end of the book, all of the characters adopt this shortened version. She will reach physical maturity after about seven years, when her physical appearance will be around seventeen, and will then stop aging.<br>  <br>  After Jacob Black imprints on Renesmee, Irina, a vampire from another coven, sees Renesmee and believes she is an "immortal child", a child who had been bitten by a vampire. She informs the Volturi, as immortal children are not allowed to live. Intent on killing Renesmee and all the Cullens, the Volturi travel to Forks. However, the Cullen family members gather witnesses from around the world to prove that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Alice brings another half-breed, Nahuel, who explains that half-breeds pose no danger to the vampires. No longer seeing Renesmee as a threat, the Volturi leave and Renesmee and her family are left in peace.|`|YzJuBPTUaa	Its in breaking dawn. You'll find out when you read it. I'll just say that Renesmee is Edwrad and Bellas Kid, coz i'm only up to the bit in breaking dawn where bellas pregnant, but a friend told me they call the baby renesemee. I donta wanna give too much away coz its a bit more compicated then that.|`|Exbr58lGaa	Renesmee is Bella and Edward's daughter and Jacob imprinted on her. Jacob and Bella were never in love. They were just good friends. Bella had to meet her own daughter because for the first 3 days of Renesmee's life, Bella was being transformed into a vampire. Hope that helps :)|`|a0Qcx9oKaa	Reneseme is Edward and Bellas Daughter.<br>  Jacob imprinted on her, so it basically make Reneseme love Jacob.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Read the last book. I'm too lazy to explain all this.|`|CWpUQtGgaa	Renesmee is Edwards and Bellas Daughter.<br>  Yes she is her parent but while she is giving "birth" 2 Renesmee Edward turns Bella into  a vampire becz she has lost 2 much blood and her bones have broken etc etc.<br>  and becz she is a NEW born its dangerous 2 put her in the same room as Bella becz its dangerous<br>  The thing she has 2 do with Jacob is that <br>  wen u cont reading <br>  the book says that<br>  werewolves do an imprint<br>  so Jacob imprints on Renesmee <br>  Hope i helped :_

I thought of it as something that my body knew how to do naturally, I was BUILT to to this job, women have been having babies since the beginning of time. and felt comfort knowing that the risks nowadays are a LOT less likely than they were years ago. Most of my fear was of the unknown, was the baby going to be healthy or not, even knowing I took the best care I could of my body. Then there was the fear of pain, I tend to have a pretty high tolerance of pain, BUT there's the fear of knowing what do during birth...you know...that kind of thing.  When I had my second child I was much less worried, but REMEMBERING the pain and toll it took on my body was plenty to think about. I ended up having two kids with no medicine...all natural...because labor was going so fast. It was a wonderful experience, and I plan on doing it again someday.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Some really do and it's sad but what's worse is the ones who have the baby and leave it in the back of someones truck or worse in a dumpster.|`|UHIi8AuQaa	not at all,i have 3 kids,none of my pregnancies would i class as hardship,or the births,although a little painfull lol,ya i can laugh now........its over with now..........|`|vm5TgsQwaa	Well when your private expands so a whole baby can come squeezing through, you can start judging women.|`|GGUDvicaaa	I don′t like children and youth. I got enough of those sewermouthed violent sleazoids and their suck-up friends in school. (I am softened, I hated them when I was 18!)|`|dk8y4eseaa	Just think after all their efforts, they are rewarded with new life. It's precious.|`|vqvQIdc3aa	I'm not even married...but I think birth and having a child of your own is a beautiful thing, and worth every pain.|`|9yPEjN4Xaa	It's not something to scoff at. There are so many changes to you body and mind when you are carrying. Morning sickness. Bloat. Aches and pains. Worrying about the well being of your child. <br>  <br>  There's something said that goes "Women become a mommy the minute they know they are pregnant. Men become fathers when the child is born." <br>  <br>  Every pregnancy is different. Every birth is different. <br>  <br>  A woman's worst menstrual cramp do not compare to birth pains. <br>  <br>  It is a burden but for most it should be a burden of love and all of it is often quickly forgotten after the child has come.|`|ylQPsjNAaa	There are some women who absolutely love being pregnant. I am not one. I had morning sickness for about six weeks. I couldn't eat anything. I threw up everything. Then it gets better! Its nice you feel "normal" then you start feeling the baby move and then you are miserable again. I have acid reflux and heartburn so bad that water makes it flare up. I can't lay down because that makes it worse. You get swollen. Although it is amazing to have a life growing inside of you you definitely miss that flat stomach. The word sexy and feeling sexy goes out the window. My husband is amazing he tells me i'm beautiful everyday but you can't help but still feel insecure. Then if something happens or when you are in labor every medical person on the labor and delivery floor sees your who ha. Not to mention the million doctor appointments you have to go to and all the blood they draw. I can't lie as soon as that wonderful baby is in your arms you forget about everything! You forget the pain the heartburn the morning sickness all of it. It is a hardship but it is sooooooo worth it. That is why i did it again! It is amazing to feel your little person moving around inside of you...well until they are on your bladder and in ribs at the same time! I don't think of it as a bad thing but it isn't the most convient thing.|`|21f49c0d7ccd68a6f78606f3d4c635fcaa	I am 7 mo. pregnant now, thankfully my pregnancy has not been bad, but I cant say the same for other women. It is very difficult being pregnant - you have mood swings, hot flashes, itchy boobs, cravings, leg cramps and the list goes on.  I know this doesn't compare to the reward you get afterwards - a beautiful baby, but it is difficult. <br>  <br>  This must be a man asking this question. It has to be. I wish men could get pregnant and have to push the baby out of their A**, so they know how it feels.|`|cdakHWNXaa	of course it's a hardship!! this little thing is growing inside of you, you're stressed out and hormonal, and then go into hours and hours of painful labor??? of course it's a hardship!!!<br>  <br>  but i don't think women view it as a "hardship". most mothers i know think of it as beautiful and an amazing experience they wouldn't trade for the world.|`|qQrsi8koaa	Its a wonderful thing to be able to experience, but it is a hardship at the same time. You're nauseous, sore, fat, you have to pee all the time, and then the birth is the most excruciating pain that you can imagine. It's both good and bad.|`|39a7746a2347212dcac38fa992a8ea93aa	It is the most natural thing in the world to give birth to a baby .|`|D8KgIX8naa	I am scared to death of giving birth; from what I hear it's  terrible!|`|c8DjmWXxaa	ever been through pregnancy and labour with your partner, i have, lets just say that im glad to be a man..|`|tPiSOCA2aa	I like Daniel's answer|`|wqchA8B7aa	Of course it's hard! You should be there when they're lugging that old belly around, and then in the delivery room. Then you'll see for real. I'm glad I never had to do it.|`|AA12380746	I sure wish I had the opportunity to know the answer to this question.|`|9IDDxwoaaa	It depends on the situation the women is in! If they didn't plan to be pregnant and didn't want to be then its going to be horrible. If it was planned then it is a more pleasant experience! Pregnancy is hard regardless though, they throw up, get cramps, stretch marks, swollen feet, give birth, bleed for a month straight, and have engorged breast!|`|VlCax7DWaa	it is no bad but i believe it is a hard work|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	Yeah i agree with Daniels (Suspended), You try having a baby come out! And then tell me what you think.|`|CArzkDIUaa	umm yeah, kinda. :\

You can easily come up with arguments, without necessarily contradicting yourself.<br>  <br>  Thw next king of England (I don't know where you are from). But it would be easy to come up with arguments for and against having the next coronation at all. But add the posibility of bypassing Charles for his son, and you now have a three way discussion. If you or I were asked to take turns in supporting each argument, we could do so.

Just because a guy smiles at you and looks at you doesn't mean that he automatically wants you to be his girlfriend. Please don't be naive. I hate it when girls think that a guy checking them out means he's madly in love with them. Sooo not true! The first guy definitely sounds like he wants to get into your pants. As for the others, people are really good at trying to appear all sweet and innocent. During teenage years, every guy's hormones are raging and they just want some action. Even some girls are the same. I'm assuming that since these four guys all go to your school, it does not seem too good to be flirting with ALL of them. You can really ruin your reputation.... that is if you don't have already have one.......
xzt6t3uSaa	i do agree about the newspaper articles and media attention. it is a bit much. but it has prompted a lot of women to have a smear test which is vital. it would be nice if jades family donated some of the millions of money to cancer research.|`|VVXpdPT0aa	hmm<br>  well<br>  it is her last chance of fame<br>  we should just let her have it for a few more months<br>  cos... soon she'll be dead :[|`|JYeIPZ0jaa	I feel sorry for her children|`|Cc7O2Jfiaa	i know what you're saying about her not being the first person to have cancer etc etc<br>  but to be honest, if i were her and i was told that i was about to die, i would do everything i could to make as much money out of it as i could to provide a bit more for my kids seeing as i wouldnt be around to see them grow up.<br>  i feel so sorry for her and her family.<br>  <br>  but dont worry your little self, you soon wont have to deal with it "shoved in your face 24/7" because she'll be dead soon and you wont have to listen to it anymore :||`|ckxpknr0aa	The publicity of her case has led to a 20% increase in young British women having smear tests for cervical cancer. This is obviously a very positive thing and will save lives.<br>  <br>  No matter what you think of Jade, it is heartbreaking that her two young sons will be left without a mum. At least she is being (typically) honest about needing the money for her sons future - in reality it's not like her mum / Jack / Jeff are going to be able to provide the security Jade can.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to hear about it you dont have to look.......|`|phD78fbRaa	I can see where you're coming from. My view is that much better, less deserving people will die on the day that she dies, so why does everyone care so much? True, she is ignorant and her recent life appears to be a series of awful mistakes on her part. But look at the facts. The uptake for smear tests has increased by quite a bit, and she theoretically could have actually saved lives through her publicity. Plus, the cancer is basically rotting her insides. I really wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. I do think, though, that she is almost cheapening her death through all this publicity, and I feel bad for her family. Who wants to have their own mother's slow, painful death on tape?|`|u7o75zipaa	I was sick of her as soon as she appeared following that big brother crap.<br>  However, I don't think anyone deserves to be in the situation she's in, and she's trying to make money for her kids (although she's probably made enough to set them up for life..).<br>  Personally I think she should get the f*ck off the news and spend the rest of her time with her family and friends.<br>  Also, people don't want to read about someone they've never heard of - which is why 'celebs' lives get discussed so much. Nobody 'deserves' media attention for being ill. They deserve privacy.|`|bznQW3QYaa	I totally disagree with you<br>  come on she got cancer she gonna die this is like her last time on earth <br>  to be honest no one deserve cancer she just happens to have bad luck <br>  don't be mean <br>  wish her all the best xD<br>  i feel sorry for her 2 lil kids :(|`|HmqHf3qDaa	you are a nasty uncaring person<br>  has anyone close to you died of cancer,,???<br>  well one day they may and the pain and suffering is unbearable,,,for them,,and for people who love them.<br>  <br>  It is a fact in this world,when people are as uncaring as you ,,,they are often visited with something that makes then deeply regret their actions and comments....<br>  <br>  I need not say any more,,,other than I will pray for your  forgiveness,|`|dDDAbqqhaa	yeah it's kinda insultin to the people and families who have lost relatives and friends to cancer<br>  <br>  much like Rihanna's situation, women get beat every day but they don't get attention and sympathy<br>  <br>  she doesn't deserve to die though|`|HG0742a9aa	well said.  plenty of people have died in far more tragic circumstances and yet the media seems to be heaving heaps of attention on this women.|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	im sorry to say i disagree wid ur point...i agree wid da phrase "what goes around comes around" but no1 deserves this.

aO5i61Cfaa	Generally speaking, I think that the people who make House go to decent lengths to make sure that the show's medical content is at least pretty close to accurate.  That said, I have heard of some instances in the past of medical shows (not necessarily House, I'm not sure...) stretching the truth, or making stuff up outright.  I would also point out that the things that happen in House are almost impossibly rare, even though they are real.  They often involve extremely uncommon illnesses, and in some cases they even involve uncommon illnesses affecting people in uncommon ways, or being combined with another uncommon illness, etc...  In other words, the odds of ever actually encountering anything you see on House in your lifetime is so small you probably have a better chance of winning the lottery three times in a row, but yes, if you see it on House, it's probably real (or at least close to it).|`|whR6j9JIaa	It's a TV show about fictional characters.<br>  <br>  That pretty much answers that.|`|it9akFuBaa	The show is of course fictional but it does maintain a sense of reality as far as the afflictions, symptoms and diagnosis.

ntj6nT28aa	Alright so I was lurking online and stuff, and I found this. It seems to be the REAL Jasey Rae because of the pictures, and in the pictures it's of her and Alex, back then when Alex hadn't put highlights in his hair yet. She told the story herself, <br>  "THE REAL JASEY RAE STORY.<br>  <br>  first i would like to say, im hoping that putting this out there it will stop all the rediculous stories you all make with your imagination.. just think if someone wrote a story about you that was 100% not true and it was put on the internet for everyone to read wouldnt you be upset. so stop acting like you are JaseyRae. you're giving me a bad name.<br>  <br>  in the year 2004 all time low was not signed to a label and none of you knew who they were. they rarely toured, and only stuck around MD. so some may have known them but if you did you would know the REAL story.<br>  <br>  Our local venue in altoona, PA (Jaggard Church) hosted lots of shows. Ryan Wapner the promoter and good friend of mine always seemed to get really good bands to play before they became huge..<br>  <br>  all time low was one of those bands, at a show about 3/4 years ago i met Alex Gaskarth, my friends at the time were really into band guys I simply just enjoyed the music and had no intentions on talking to alex. but he approached me and we pretty much talked the rest of the night. He had asked me to keep in touch and we continued talking by phone and computer.<br>  <br>  a couple months past and we became REALLY close and were really into eachother. He came back to altoona to play another show and we basically acted like we were dating the whole night and i guess we basically were without the label.. but whatever it was so long ago.<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS. that night we partied with them and alex and I spent the whole night watching movies cuddling on the couch. one thing led to another you don't need details and we ended up sleeping together.<br>  <br>  we said i love you, but we were young and obviously he didn't mean it and at the time i did.<br>  <br>  the next day when he left to go back to MD. it was a sad goodbye I really liked him.<br>  <br>  I would say for a month after that night we kept talking continuously until one day alex texted me and said "omg this is so cool we are hanging out with PARAMORE and cute is what we aim for, we just got signed to a label!" (this is when paramore wasnt that known as well)<br>  <br>  needless to say he was pretty busy, but i stopped getting calls...texts....emails.... and he ignored all mine as well.. so basically he just stopped talking to me without an explanation, just left me hanging.<br>  <br>  I was devistated at first. but the sad feeling turned into more of a hateful feeling.<br>  <br>  4 months later they came back to altoona and he acted like nothing happened.. like i shouldnt be mad.. but i wasnt about to make a scene so i just never said anything but didnt go around him much.<br>  <br>  that night there was a rumor "alltimelow had a suprise for me" and it ended up being that song.<br>  <br>  since then i tried to maintain a friendship but i gave up all his fame has gone to his head and he isnt even the same person.<br>  <br>  soo as of today, i will not go see them and i live in chicago soo i wont run into them<br>  <br>  soo in his interviews he will say we are friends, but we really arnt.<br>  <br>  but that pretty much sums up where the song probably came from, nothing glamourous but its true. so i'd appriciate it if you read this and you made up your own story please delete it. or at least post that its YOUR VERSION NOT THE TRUE STORY."<br>  <br>  <br>  And yeah. If you go to that site and scroll down, you can see the pictures.|`|8118e5dc5860c44897f5b576d6daf893aa	i'm not sure but all time low is amazing<3333333

ThKkn5fKaa	You sound a lot like me!  Every major symphony orchestra has a choir that performs with it, and nearly all of these choirs are comprised almost completely of volunteers.  Most of these people are simply working professionals with 9 to 5 jobs that happen to also be terrific singers. My choir, for instance, The Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh, is the choir that sings with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.  We have 115 members.  20 paid core, and 95 volunteers.  We practice once a week for 2 and 1/2 hours, although during concert weeks we typically have one conductor's piano rehearsal and then 2 rehearsals with the orchestra.  Singing with the symphony is incredibly rewarding and the members of the orchestra really appreciate our work and have a lot of respect for our talents.  And because you are like me and really love choral orchestral works it will be even more rewarding for you.  I cannot recommend it enough, as long as you have the time in your evenings to attend rehearsals and do a little bit of practicing on your own.  You get to meet new people.  it's challenging.  You get to work with famous people!  (I just worked with John Adams!)  I couldn't recommend it enough.    The rep is wonderful too.  This season we premiered a new piece by Derek Bermel, sang Handel's Messiah, did a Christmas Pop's concert, sang On The Transmigration of Souls under the baton of John Adams, and we will be performing Carmina Burana both in Pittsburgh and Erie, a secret "mystery piece", Rachmaninoff's Spring Cantata, Rachmaninoff's Vespers (that's in our own concert without the symphony), and we are finishing the season with the magnificent Mahler Symphony No. 2 "Resurrection".  We are also sending a small contingent of our choir down to Washington DC to perform in the Library of Congress Concerts.    The symphony just released a schedule for next season, and just at first glance, it's starting to look wonderful as it includes such pieces as Beethoven's 9th and Mozart's Requiem.  The feeling that you get in performing such pieces with a professional orchestra really cannot be quantified.    If you want to know anything more about the topic please feel free to send me an email.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	the essential quality required is excellent sight reading, as professional choirs can't afford the rehearsal time accorded amateurs. Try joining your local Phil    EDIT..delicio there are loads of pro choirs in the UK, every cathedral has one|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I don't know which country you're in but here in the UK there are hardly any 'professional' choirs at all (the BBC Singers being the best-known of a rare breed). All the big, major choirs are amateur (including those like the LSO Chorus, BBC Symphony Chorus, Brighton Festival Chorus, et al). Because these choirs comprise working people, they always rehearse one weekday evening per week (sometimes slightly more approaching a major performance). If you do a bit of internet research on choirs in your country and in your region, I am sure you will find that most or all of them are amateur and do an interesting and wide-ranging repertoire.    'Professional' choirs nearly always entirely comprise professional singers (often young singers near the beginning of their careers) and so you would probably be best joining a good amateur one.    Edit for Dr John:  I did not include church choirs because they are not professional in the way that they earn their livelihood from it. What they are paid is mere pocket money. Nor do they engage in regular public concert performances outside their immediate context.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	There are some extremely professional amateur choirs around. Best to look around and see if you like them The best ones  will need you to audition so hopefully you are a good sight reader!|`|2rdXW293aa	Many people in community choirs have excellent voices, a lot of experience singing the "big stuff," yet are in other professions than music.    You've gotten a lot of great advice already. I also wanted to mention church choirs. When I'd move to a new place (for a job), I'd search out the church with the biggest and best choir, then sing with them. Never had to join the church. We'd do the big works (Messiah, Elijah, requiems by Brahms, Mozart, Rutter, Durufle, etc.) and often have orchestral accompaniment by members of our local (superb) symphony.    Another benefit of a church choir is that you can miss the odd rehearsal and not be kicked out. (I know law school is very demanding.) But I hope you'll join a community choir; most have a paid core and are really superb.     If you move to a new area, people to contact for places to sing include private voice teachers, high school music directors, the opera artistic director (if you have an opera group there) and church choir directors. And of course the internet is invaluable.    Best of luck to you! It's so great that you're going to keep singing.

gGZz2EGyaa	Who cares if he is gay or not, I like Paul O Grady.  I like him as Lily Savage and just like him on his show as a presenter.  I was given his book for Christmas and it was lovely to read, what a laugh.  He has not written all his life in the one book so there must be another one on its way.  I look forward to reading it when it does come out.  3 cheers for Paul O Grady from me. As you say he is a legend, a legend in his own lifetime.|`|9NrmdSdkaa	I love Paul   he great !!!!  and an ideal rolemodel   i would love to meet him to   it would be a dream come true|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	I think he can be really funny at times.

"The Company of Wolves"  Sarah Paterson in the lead role of "Rosaleen". It was her debut film, and she was only 12, yet seemed 16+.   Micha Bergese, also in his first film. He wasn't an actor, but a dancer, and they cast him because they wanted someone who could move in a certain way.      PJ :   It's a modern classic!  Sean Pertwee was wonderful in it, especially when talking about "sausages"! And who knew the real reason superglue was invented...  I also loved Liam Cunningham, but we didn't get to see him enough :(    Trivia moment :  Though all born in different years, most of my favourite actors were born within about a week of each other {and I was born on June 7th} :~  June 2nd : Liam Cunningham  June 4th : Sean Pertwee  June 6th : Jason Isaacs, and Danny Webb  June 9th : David Troughton  June 10th : Ben Daniels  Several of these guys have worked together in various things, so wonder what it was like if they were filming around those days...?!

UIT1khqtaa	[REC]  THE EVIL DEAD  and 4BIA|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Recently, I watched The Chaser (2008), which was a little better than the usual horror recycled crap.  It was Korean, so expect American remake to be done in about a year - like every other Asian movie.  It's more about a serial killer than a monster or something, but I guess that counts as horror.|`|4ek58DIoaa	my bloody valentine 3D|`|tLI94qWNaa	The Silence of the lambs, just an amazing movie.  More suspense then actuall horror though so I will give you my second favorite horror movie which is the descent.|`|S4z7mefcaa	Soooooo many to choose from.  The first that comes to mind is the first Alien movie because it scared the crap out of me.  I remember watching it at the drive in and being terrified.  Also, I loved Dawn of the Dead (and that whole series by Romero really).|`|AM33tqYAaa	the 1974 texas chainsaw massacre|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Les Diaboliques|`|AA10725587	I like the friday the 13th series, texas chainsaw massacre and the evil dead series.|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	The Ring 1,2  The Others  28 Weeks Later  The Happening  The Mist  Mirrors  any zombie/vampire movies  I have more i just can't think of them|`|5KfVmEEQaa	MIRRORS|`|BpD01lccaa	Amittyville Horror the first one not the new one.|`|3ca7663cc9cf92c53a5cde34351097a5aa	Oldies...  "The Maniac". "Are you Alone", and "The Shining" and I love the movie "Seven"  and "Carrie"|`|Ca8i226Xaa	The Exorcist is the greatest horror movie ever made. The first major movie to deal with demonic possession, which featured a great script, excellent acting and find directing. The music, Tubular Bells, was also first rate.    Halloween, the original, was also a great horror movie. Most of the movies today are boring slasher movies or sadistic torture flicks, which are spiritually harmful to those who watch them.|`|1b34eac5081b017e04959edf0e12984faa	SAW Series  Friday the 13th Series  Halloween Series (NOT Halloween III)  A Nightmare on Elm Street Series  Texas Chainsaw Massacre Series  The Classic/Cult films of Horror (www.houseofhorror.com)|`|A71kX3d4aa	My favorite horror movie is definitely The Uninvited!

euZRbiA2aa	Generation terrorists the best.  Think a lot of songs on Everything must go were writtin by Richey.They went downhill a little after using his songs.But i still love em.

In my opinion|`|aB4n96vhaa	everything must go or gold against the soul for me they are absolutely superb live|`|VTdt0yKQaa	yes they were a lot better when richey was in the band  their best album is the holy bible  can you remember them on totp's  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3hMqpR9Aog...|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	With Richey in the band they had a raw energy and passion, and a uniqueness. After he disappeared, and they had used his songs for Everything Must Go, they lost all that for me, and don't seem to have any direction now they have become mainstream.  For me best album is a tie between Generation Terrorists and The Holy Bible.  There is talk of a new album of Richey material coming soon though.

lJEWuhThaa	Kings of Leon is phenomenal, and I agree with all of the songs that Hallie H listed as well.  However if you are into the new cd I would suggest the very last song, "Cold Desert".  The lyrics are great and the song is beautiful.  My favorite overall song is probably "Trani" though.  That song is unreal and there are some really good videos of them playing it live on YouTube.|`|uW4npxzFaa	This is my favourite band  Please give all their songs a chance  My favorite: True Love Way, Fans, Taper Jean Girl, Closer, Milk, Tranni. I could go on and on
NourECCgaa	use somebody actually isnt the conventional kings of leon song... it is their mainstream sounding hit and there is not much else that sounds like that... but i guess the song revelry off their new album is a little similar, also on antoher note the song closer is very good as well|`|p8GOUOShaa	sticks on fire|`|EzqfAUFuaa	i really like use somebody too. dont know too much by them, but the bucket is kinda like use somebody. i still like use somebody better tho...|`|bribxhsdaa	"On Call" - www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EA7-QANdxU    Most people who don't even like Kings Of Leon tend to like it.     I think its arguably their best song.

8ad6fQiNaa	Since you have an internet connection, I'd suggest getting a subscription to Marvel's digital comics. It's about 60 bucks a year and gives you access to thousands of comics. They don't have entire series on the site itself (there are a few missing here and there), but they have the major storylines and are adding new ones every weekday (I don't know why they don't update on weekends).        It will give you a good idea which Xmen series you'd want to go with and give you a good background into all of them. Plus it might help to open you up to some other comics. I was never a captain America fan, but I've been reading his comic now because I have access. There is a lot of cross over from one comic to the next as well (spiderman works with the Xman and half the story is told in his comic, while part is told in Astonishing xmen and another part in Uncanny xmen) With the digital comics, you can actually read all the cross overs and get all the information.|`|SX8z4fNtaa	go to the library and check out all the Men trades they have the old comics are most like the 90's series|`|VLRkJOOuaa	I haven't read much of the comics either, but I have always loved the animated series (and even some of the live-action movies).    Personally, I thought the Uncanny X-Men was one of the best. If not that one, I would say the Astonishing X-Men is just as good.    Hopefully this will help! I love X-Men too! (:|`|MhjZMgzTaa	I haven't read an X-Men comic since like the late 90's. The older Uncanny X-Men used to be my favorite, and in my opinion were more like the cartoon. Not really sure about the newer versions that are out now. Last time I looked at an X-men comic they had a bunch of new characters, so I'm not sure which ones are like the 90's now.|`|dfSrcJjhaa	UNCANNY X-MEN is the flagship of the mutant titles. If you only read one title that is the one. There is a rumor that Marvel is going to start publishing it 3 times a month soon like they have been doing with AMAZING SPIDER-MAN for more than a year.
7ntSRsZLaa	Yeah, it's definetely normal.  I look up to certain people and I feel totally obsessed too.  I don't even think obsession is the right word.. it's more like..  admiration.  I think when a person is in love and admires someone, they're either just like them or they want to be them.|`|79b8592899aa3dcb578c630cb4ebe264aa	Its ok as long as you dont start asking her address and stuff(some do on here)She is an amazing actress I remember seeing her in silkwood and Saying now thats acting.Check out Wikipedia or IMDB and check out the whole list of movies she has been in she can play any role rather Comedy or Drama.|`|Lx2WpyKYaa	She a brilliant actress and she very good at singing i want to see her new movie it looks good! Mamma Mia is such a good film   (Colin Firth 
lMOXHh45aa	As a matter of fact they *DO*... well, to a tolerable extent. Pop Champagne wasn't that bad to me, and Arab Money could be better, but Jumpin out the window is one of *THE* worst songs i ever heard... and i am not just sayin that to say it. The crazy thing about it is, when i first heard Pop Champagne i thought i was kanye, i didn't really hear arab money alot, and when I heard jumpin out the window i thought it was a parody of Kanye or somethin... really... I was drivin the first time i heard it and on that part where he keeps repeating "americaaaaa" i thought to myself 'this cannot be serious'- do you know how *ANGRY* i got when i found it was??? What in the h*ll is that??? i was gonna post a question on it and i never did, now you're gettin all the frustration. The beats have the same kinda drums, He sings the *EXACT* same way (listen to how he says "oh ohhhhh" in pop champagne, and then "windoooow" on jumpin out the window) And at least on dance songs when they're sayin the same word over and over its for you to do the frickin dance, this fool is just yellin "windoooow" and sh*ts for no d*mn reason other than the fact thats all he could think of... if i ever saw him i would ghetto chop the *SH!T* outta him for this, its unforgivable. he's reached flo rida's status with me, and there's no turning back from that.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Very similar.  He uses alot of the same production techniques and they get old fast.  It's almost like he only bought one side of a production board.  The other half don't work or something.|`|GM8xyco0aa	Yeah the darn auto tuner lol but the Jumpin song is SO ANNOYiNG!|`|454b1205f51bc09f24398fb4e8479cc9aa	They Are. He Can't Change It Up.

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Because,<br>  a) Britain is cold! We need a hot drink to warm us up<br>  b) It's got just the right amount of caffeine to wake us up without turning us into nervous wrecks<br>  c) It tastes nice and it's a good thirst-quencher<br>  d) It doesn't make your breath smell and your tongue all furry like coffee does.<br>  e) It's great with a bacon sandwich!<br>  f) Monkeys like it. And we all know how intelligent they are.|`|F49y3gImaa	I'm American, and I drink at least a gallon of tea a day. (no lie. I seriously have to fix a new pitcher every day, and I'm the only one that drinks it.)<br>  <br>  When I was little my mom didn't know I was lactose intolerant, and every time she gave me milk to drink, I would end up sick. That's when she started putting tea in my bottle. I was literally raised on it. That must be the reason why i love it :)|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	I don't know, but it sure is delish.|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	They're weird like that.|`|SLFt8eHEaa	We don't! It's just a stereotype.  I can't stand tea, even the smell of it makes me want to vomit and I've never had a cup of it in my life.  I also know plenty of my fellow countrymen and women just like me.  It's just one of those stereotypes.|`|borw2oKCaa	its part of their culture. For example, we eat certain foods just as often as they drink tea and they might ponder the same question about our taste.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way ignore some of the ignorant answers you seem to be getting o_o...Im American and I personally like the British.|`|p1RdTbP2aa	I don't like Tea at all...........<i'm british>........to much tea-ness, But I think it's to do with tradition the whole Queen thing. Also some people like it, don't ask me why!<br>  But also don't some americans LOVE COFFEE! <br>  What's with that!|`|9YAP6MmUaa	cos tea is nice! why else?|`|p6BLIraCaa	Im British..<br>  Coffee is a lot better though<br>  (I live in the U.S.A now though)<br>  <br>  Besides why does it matter what we eat..<br>  <br>  Why are a lot of Americans fat?<br>  Why do some Asians like Noodles?<br>  But more importantly...<br>  Why do you care?|`|547Ln6rNaa	Oh I don't find tea essential, it's good to have some about when you run out of coffee though. <br>  <br>  <br>  rambunctious 3oh!3 addict - are you on a dare to say Rosy for every answer? tell me, I'm fascinated....|`|ZFEtrB39aa	Because it has a comforting feel to it, because you can dip it in buiscuits.|`|tqBy3vXvaa	This is becoming a rivalry. Anyways, I'm not sure. My british cousin told me "tea" is another word for dinner?|`|6a837ae9c1fed73d9a78152ddfe4b038aa	I drink tea Im American. I drank coffee for years until this last Dec gave it up. Now I drink first thing every morning.|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	stereotype|`|x7vB4P5Naa	It's simply smashing darling....yea, baby, yeeeaaa!!!!!|`|6aawDPkSaa	oh it's an old tradition...i love tea. i can act posh at teatimes ^^ haha|`|BE0zSvlkaa	when brit and america were on bad terms during the revolutionary period they created a trade barrier so trade was prohibited in between them and britain was where the americans go their tea and with trade cut off they had to form some kind of other drink and thats why coffee was invented as a substitute for tea|`|ZmgrkOF6aa	we dont it is a sterotype same goes to why are all americans fat|`|36B3vmyDaa	Yes it is true many of us can't seem to get through the day without a cup of tea<br>  It's a strange thing but  a person can go off for the day and drink the same brand made in the same way even out of the same cup but it never tastes the same as what we make at home<br>  Time to get the kettle on|`|p0BVk8lhaa	because beer makes them burp|`|zWpaE74Saa	Not all of us like Tea!!<br>  <br>  i prefer coca cola and pepsi...|`|icSFe3byaa	Because it's delicious!<br>  <br>  I see more Tea drinking in America though tbh what with all the iced tea varieties and all.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	who cares>?|`|YvOm6u65aa	I can't stand tea.

1YcKHGLqaa	Make an entire day about her. If she already has birthday plans, pick her up the day before and tell her to clear her schedule, and that you're picking her up for breakfast. Figure out her favorite foods and totally spoil her by making them. Then find out movies she's been wanting to see, things she's been wanting to do, etc. and take her to do them. Give her a little tiara and proclaim her princess for the day. Sky's the limit. Let her know that it's up to her, but have a list of things stashed away incase she's indecisive.     After a couple of fun things (movie and lunch, shopping, anything), have something really special planned; a surprise party, tickets to a musical or concert she's been wanting to see, etc. Finish it off by taking her home, producing a comfy pair of PJs and her favorite sleepover flick and some ice cream, and finish off the day winding down and acting like kids :)    My best friend did this for me one year and I was SO thrilled! The best part was getting t do it all together :)|`|ztb1F35Xaa	depends...how old is she turning|`|GRa8dmx7aa	I'd say turnabout is fair play.  You should do at least as much as she did for you.

It is technically 4 words, but when they file in it goes under A the "the" is dropped. Maybe "Angels and Insects" it was nominated from an Oscar.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Based on your description, I would say it is definitely not 'A Walk to Remember', since that is 4 words long and it came out in 2002.      Can you give any more info?|`|T3Q6QwvDaa	A walk to remember|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	What was the movie about, i'm pretty sure there are a number of movie that came out in the 90's that start with "A" and have won some type of award|`|E01Mw1hhaa	It's most likely gonna be  'A walk to remember'    If not, i have no clue.  sorryy.|`|0OtHu9Zmaa	The first thing that popped into my mind based on your description is 'A Walk To Remember'

Check then out:    Warbringer(Great new thrash band)  The Sword  Testament  Exodus  Suicidal Tendencies  Brother Cane(Great hard rock band from the early to mid 90's)  Reverend Horton Heat(You might like Rock-A-Billy)  Sepultura  Death(Don't know if you'll like death metal, but try it)  Pantera    These bands are a little harder than Nickleback, 3 Doors Down, and 3 Days Grace, but since I am not a fan of them I really don't have a comparison them.

YOGPspsgaa	Dude. Chill. I read all 4 books and they aren't that great. I honestly thought they would be great considering all the hype but they aren't. Seriously why the hell do all the girls love Edward? He's more like a fairy in my opinion. As for Bella, she whines all the time and is a terrible heroine. <br>  <br>  edward is so perfect it bores me. bella is so ungrateful it irritates me but yet people still like her. From what I got after reading the books is that bella loves edward because he sparkles and is just so dang hot and that edward loves bella because he can't read her mind and  smells so nice he wants to eat her. <br>  <br>  But overall it was good to pass time reading. But if you like it then hey you like it. I mean no offense to anyone who likes the books.|`|lrRDD1p2aa	Never read them. Don't intend to... So I would say no.|`|vNprxduNaa	lol i have read the series of twilight and im not obsessed with Edward either. but my friend is crazy about him and has so much stuff with his name and picture! it is possible not to be obsessed with him and that doesnt mean you're a werewolf. nice thought though! =]
YBFg3NVgaa	Trapt is kinda like them, they both have great music.
ZQEqxDcDaa	Every concert I've been to has said that aswell. I still use my camera though. just take it, and if other people use theirs, you do so too :]
