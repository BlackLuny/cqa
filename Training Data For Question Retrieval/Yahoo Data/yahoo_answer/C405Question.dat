20090223114920AAyO6oF	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	I'm an electrician and my boss uses a lot of lingo I don't know.?	Yesterday he said "go down to Ju-ju's and get me a new gay-basher and some Salomi string."  Well, Ju-ju's is Cohen's Lighting supply center.  "gay basher" is a pair of Klein Electrician's pliers and Salomi string is red 12 gauge THHN wire.   Last week he said "Hey Crooked, grab your pussyhat because Donut Dave is here and Mooks needs you to get in the hotbox."  I guess I'm Crooked, a pussyhat is a hard hat, Donut Dave is the OSHA inspector and the hotbox is the Switchgear.   Or, "touch that crazy hair and tell me if it's on fire?" That means touch the dangling piece of 277V BX and find out whether it's hot. Is there a dictionary where I can learn this lingo? Everyone says he's a little crazy, but he's paying me $9/hour under the table, so I can't turn it down.

Will Hope Depot or Lowe's or somebody makes these cuts for me if I bring in the measurements? Any recommendations? Thanks!

Normally that would be an easy repair, but this is an extra deep sink that was installed extra close to the wall, so there is hardly any room to work where the hose is attached, and the attachment is way up behind the sink.      A plumber told us he'd have to remove the whole sink to replace the hose. Rather than pay for that, I tried wrapping the hose with silicon tape, then wrapping that with electrical tape. That held for a while but now it has sprung a leak.       Any suggestions on repairing that plastic hose without replacing it?         Thanks,      Greg

I'm talking so light gray it looks white compared to the white garage next to it. The house has blue shutters on it now and I HATE blue. I don't want to do dark green because I'm worried it won't look that good. I'm almost thinking of going with a plum color because I love the color and I think it would look nice against the siding. I'm also thinking of burgundy.       What would be your pick and why?

While remodeling the bathroom, I ended up taking out the old subfloor because of rot around the old toilet. Now I'm ready to lay down the new 3/4" plywood, but I'm a bit worried about the strength of the subfloor by the toilet flange because I'd need to put a joint there if I'm going to come close to surrounding the plumbing. Not good if there are no joists underneath...   Bracing wouldn't work well underneath (because of the plumbing). Should I take off the flange in order to simply cut a hole in the plywood? Then there would be no joints in the plywood.  The flange is on an ABS elbow, then about 2' of ABS, then the cast iron main waste pipe.

I see no cement on any of the joints. Can I just hammer them apart and put on the new parts and pieces? Should I take it off at the elbow or at the connection into to iron waste pipe? There is also a rubber seal that connects the ABS into the vertical waste pipe.   Also - when everything is fixed and pretty, should I bolt down the new flange flush to the subfloor? There will eventually be a tiled floor on top.      Thanks...

20090223141416AAJXA8Y	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Do you think these housekeeper fees are fair?	I'm trying to pick up some extra income by cleaning homes on the side.  I've done some research about other home cleaning fee's.  This is what I've come up for my area.  Merry Maids is average $200-$300 per job.  And some independent people charge a flat rate of $60.  What would you pay to have someone clean your home?  What's the size?  Is is super dirty?  Any advice or opinions on how to charge would be greatly appreciated!   This is what I was thinking, what do you think?   I would provide the cleaning products.  Preferably the client would provide a broom, mop, and vacuum.    $40 for the first 2 hours.   $10/ every hour after   Laundry an extra $10   Windows and extra $10   Walls and extra $5-10   (Of course the prices may go up or down just a little depending on how dirty or clean their house is.  This is just a ballpark figure I would throw out there to give the client something to go off of.)      I would ask for payment at the time of services.  I like the idea of a flat rate just because I know I would get paid something everytime, but sometimes a flat rate might not be enough (depending how dirty the home is and how long it might take to clean).  Should I do price based on a one time cleaning or if they wish to have me back more often?   Sorry for all the questions, it's just I'm new at this and I really don't know where to start.      Thanks!!!

The outlet was shattered so I had to replace it. After disassembly of the broken outlet, I noticed there were 6 wires holding it together. I assume 2 hot, 2 neutral, and two ground. I thought it was odd this switch had two grounds, that didn't seem normal to me but I am no electrician. I rewired the new outlet exactly as before, and with the two ground wires going into the same grounding receptacle. Now I have a problem where the new outlet is continously hot, and the switch now turns on and off three lights in other rooms.       It also caused a circuit to break when I switched the main breaker back on. What should I do to fix? And is there eminent danger in this faulty wiring?
