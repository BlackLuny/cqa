20090131154930AAmDf64	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Would you eat this little creation i made with leftovers?	We had left over boiled chicken and microwaved potatoes. So i pull out some tomato sauce, you know, that comes in a small-ish can? then tomato soup, and milk. I pour 1/4 of a can of the soup , like a cup of milk, and the whole can of tomato sauce to simmer... shred some chicken into it. Then i took some olive oil, heated that up, and spiced what was left of the chicken with cumin, pepper, salt, and a dash of garlic. I start to fry that, and after a bit, i take those potatoes and crumbled them with the chicken in the pan, with the skins still. When a few minutes goes by the tomato thing i made was done, so i poured it into the frying pan and mixed it all together. Let it cook for a minute, then voila, i was done.       So what do you think?   Would you try this?   I really enjoyed it, because the tomato mixed with the potato and chicken well, also I topped with mozzarella.   The cumin tasted great as well. At least to me

20090226091308AAckCL6	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How Would You Teach a Teenager Cooking Skills?	I'm 15 and I wanted to take cooking with my friends in High School, but I thought back to what my mom said last year when I thought about taking Cooking (I had to take Spanish instead ... long story). She said that she could teach me how to cook, and I would really like to learn from her because I think it's important to spend more time with my mom (and get us both away from our computers).      I wanted to help her make a course outline though (I asked her to do it, but she said "Whatever you want to learn") ... I don't know how I would do it though!      - How would you teach your teen how to cook?   - When would you teach them?   - Would you give homework and/or tests?   - Anything else I'm missing?      Thanks guys ... hope to receive lots of answers!
