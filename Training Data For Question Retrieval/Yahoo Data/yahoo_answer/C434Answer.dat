Gzk1TQFAaa	I hang my clothes year round.  If it's raining or too cold to go outside I hang them on my porch.  The clothes dryer uses a ton of energy so if you consistently line dry your clothes you're bound to save money (a noticeable amount on your electric bill).  How much you would save would depend, in part,  on how much laundry you're doing.<br>  You're savings wouldn't end there, though.  Dryers tumble the clothes and shred the fibers that hold the fabric together, they also heat them so they actually burn.  Hang drying your clothes will keep your brights brighter, your blacks black and whites white.  In short, your clothes will last longer and look better.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I hang a lot of our clothes up to dry or to finish drying in the winter and when the weather isn't good for drying outside.  <br>  <br>  I send the clothes for a short run in the dryer to soften them up and take the wrinkles out and then hang on hangers.  Now I do dry towels in the dryer completely; I've had issues with  them getting stinky if left to dry on their own.  I do have a small fan I run in the bathroom/laundry area to keep the air circulating around also.  The fan also moves the heat around from the dryer when it's running.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say exactly how much you'll save because dryers use different amounts of electricity.  Newer dryers are more efficient than most older ones.  The size of the dryer, the size of the load and how much you pay per kilowatt hour for your electricity all figure in to the equation.  But you will save and every thing that you can do adds up!  For both your budget and for the environment!|`|F3ppjOwlaa	My dryer is electric and uses quite a bit of energy.  I hang my clothes in my laundry room and use a dehumidifier is the humidity goes up.|`|fzFCxHy9aa	lol to jiggy jammer. thats hilarious.|`|tqyO80Mnaa	ur a cheap hobo.. ur dryer doesnt use that much energy
12ALGqtdaa	You might consider switching to Bio-Kleen products. They smell better and are made from biodegradable ingredients. I can't stand the smell of chemical laundry detergents, dryer sheets, or fabric softener. Don't even get me started on bleach... It's so bad for you and your family. Anyway, yeah I'd recommend going to natural cleaning products in every way (not just laundry).|`|tqyO80Mnaa	uhh.. you should probably open a window
AA11868805	Just about any home improvement store will have a how-to book covering pool issues.  More detailed ones are found at a pool store.  The biggest concern is chemical balance.  For instance, a previous answer accurately said neutral pH is 7.0.  But the best pH level for a pool is 7.4 - 7.6 (slightly on the base side of the scale) for a balance between not being to corrosive, and not scaling up the pool (among other side effects).  Long story short - get a reference book.<br>  <br>  As far as a cover - if the cover does not 'seal' off the pool, debris just falls on the cover, blows to the edges, and gets into the pool anyway, while at the same time not allowing the "skimming" action of the pool to pick up the debris and leaves before they sink.  So, while 'bubble"-type covers help with evaporation, not so much with keeping clean.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|qEy34ueZaa	You can not avoid the maintenance work. The cover, mostly used in the Winter, protects the water from debris, and avoids a water bill comes Summer. <br>  Besides operating costs (pump, chemicals, etc.), you will need to remove debris blown into it. You will also need to keep the pH at the proper level (pH is an acid alkaline scale which runs from 1=very acid to 14=very alkaline. pH 7.0 is neutral. Your tap water runs between 7 and 8.5, to give you an idea). This is accomplished by collecting pool water samples, and additing proper chemicals, time consuming. Pool dealers will test your pool water sample (at a cost), and advise you on the proper chemicals to add, which they supply. I advise you to search and become familiar with these facts, as it will help you out. I have seen a lot of pools containing excessive amounts of chlorine, which will have a burning effect on your eyes and skin.<br>  Maintenance: yes. Physical work: yes. Enjoyment comes at a cost, but it is doable, if you are willing to do it.|`|VgXKFHypaa	They are not expensive to maintain if you have a good filter system.You will have to add chemicals on a daily basis but when you are floating on your sponge bob raft all will be good in your world.

AA11759897	Sounds a bit like air pressure switch or fan sticking. If the switch is stuck this will stop the fan from starting. When the boiler won't start, then with the flat of your hand hit the right hand side of the boiler near the top (that's were the switch is mounted) if not accessible then slap the front. This action often resets  the air switch. Can't guarantee it but it dose work sometimes.

x7duxnBLaa	Don't worry, even though you can't see the mother around, she's close by.  Mother rabbits do not stay with their nest, but visit their babies approximately twice a day to feed them, usually eary morning and in the late afternoon.  Leave them where they're at and the mother will take care of them.  They leave their nest in a very short period of time.  <br>  <br>  It would be helpful if you mow your lawn, to stay completely away from this area, as the noise will scare the babies out of their nests and they could be killed.  You could manually trim the grass in this area (it would be the kind thing to do) (=  Also, their nests are VERY shallow and they could be fatally injured from the lawnmower.|`|AA10811976	I found a bunnie nest once.

gaITsKksaa	Yes, I do. I don't exactly know where to begin because I don't know what you need but here's an overview.<br>  There are a lot of varieties. Some do well in full sun and some need afternoon shade. I don't know where you live so I can't recommend... Jasmine blooms once a year most of the time and holds it's flowers for about 2-3 months. Some varieties grow in vine-form like Star Jasmine and jasminoides polyanthus. Both of these have white flowers but the latter also has a pink tinge to it. Carolina jasmine is also a vine and has a yellow flower. If you prefer a bush-type jasmine, Cestrum (Night-blooming jasmine) grows upright. It is a woody-looking plant and goes to sleep in the cold season. Fantastic choice for planting near a bedroom window. Arabian jasmine is also neat. It's a smaller, fuller-looking plant with delicate white flowers. Angel Wing jasmine is a cutie as well. The white flowers are shapes liked stars. It tends to entwine itself onto neighboring plants like the vine jasmines do, but this one can be contained to look like a bush. Be prepared to prune regularly if you plant jasmine and understand that they don't flower year-round. They are, however, worth the wait.|`|AA11498082	Agree with His's great answer.<br>  <br>  Additionally jasmine is poisonous - degree of toxic threat determinded by the variety of cultivar.  Some jasmine nectar (remember sipping honeysuckle as a kid) can make small children very ill.

E5gaKzCsaa	I've done some machine dyeing and haven't had any problems with dye staining the machine. I think they just say that so you can't sue them if it happens, but washers are almost always porcelain inside and that's very hard to stain, should only happen if the porcelain is scratched badly. Dye can stain the plastic agitator a little but not enough to make any difference. After you've finished dyeing, you run a cycle of bleach and water only through the machine to rinse out any remaining dye, and you carefully wipe off any splashed dye. And it will splash--if you must open the machine while it's agitating, keep the cover down until it's really stopped.<br>  <br>  So I'd dye the jeans, and use several packages of black dye to be sure they get black enough.|`|jtD61rhPaa	i dont know im just like reallly  really  board and im emo....so i just looked up ..paint yahoo,,on google...lalalalalalalalalala.....boardo... lalalalalalalallalalalalala my computer is white thats all i know...yea  imm    emo......<br>                                  BYEZ
AA11332224	The colour of petals is genetic and petals do not contain chlorophyll. The colour of leaves is also genetic but as most leaves contain chlorophyll, which uses light energy to assist in making the sugars the plant uses for food, they are generally green or greenish.<br>  <br>  Even plants which have strong red pigment in their leaves, such as the copper beech and many other plants with similar foliage, have chlorophyll but the green is masked by the other pigments.|`|AA11047051	I don't know about many flowers but hydrangas vary depending on the acidity in the soil.

I removed all of the covers and dyed them all black individually in small batches on my stove.  I have three kids as well and they had just destroyed my couch.  It turned out really well and a few of the stains were still visible through the black, but they were not really noticeable.  I did used to have stripes and they showed through a little bit as well.  I feel like I have a new couch.  I also made new throw pillows for it.  I used Rit liquid dye to do it.  Make sure you have plenty of salt also.|`|l2FetQ6waa	Seriously I would not dye your couch!! Make or buy a slip cover or something. It is more expensive but it will pay off in the long run by being able to wash it and you can buy multiples covers to switch it up a little. It will also make your couch last longer too. The dye may rub off on peoples clothes and it could be very messy. The dye may also go all the way into the cushioning of you couch and ruin it.<br>     <br>  I would say your best bet is to get a slip cover or buy a new couch. But whatever you do DON'T DYE IT!!!

As I General Contractor myself, I always note in our proposal that there will be damage, not maybe, there will be damage to the yard from equipment,trucks if we are putting in footings/foundation for a room addition. I also take pictures of the area including any concrete or asphalt driveways to verify what condition they were in prior to us even starting. If i think there is any chance that a driveway concrete or asphalt will suffer from our equipment I will also make a special note that our work requires us to drive on this old driveway, and that there will be more damage to this already cracked driveway. <br>  This should have been discussed prior to starting the project. <br>  You need to bring this up as soon as possible to clear the air on it.<br>  Average cost just to buy,place and finish new concrete at 4-5" thick is about $4 per square foot. To bust up the old and haul off is about $1.50 per sq foot. Depending on the size of your contractors proposal in dollars, he may agree to paying for a portion of the new drive, but I doubt he will agree to paying for it all. You probably should pay for a small portion as you will have a brand new driveway, not one in the shape your old one was in. <br>  Talk to your contractor about it as soon as possible.<br>  We always tell our customers it is much more economical for them to call a small landscape company, or get a couple of college kids to fix ruts or damaged places in the yard after we are done. It's not that we don't want to do it, it's just that our work force gets paid a lot more per hour than landscapers. As for the driveway - we would have said something prior to starting about it.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Ask the contractor about it he might be nice and get it fixed. If he give you a hard time about it call the cement company let them know what happened. then leave alone and take some pictures. Wait until the project is over to bring it up again. <br>  You do not want to get in a fight with your contractor over this... this is how construction horror stories start. <br>  <br>  Legally i would say responsibility should be split 3 ways.You are not entitled to a new driveway because your drive was not in good shape to start.  You and the contractor should of realized that the cement truck would ruin the drive way. and the truck driver should of reminded the contractor. It would be nice if the cement comany could supply the cement or black top for free and you pay for other material and split the labor costs with the contractor.

You obviously have power if the fan runs and the thermostat is rarely the problem. The fan won't work if the blower door is loose so that is not it either. <br>  <br>  You probably have a ceramic hot surface igniter that is bad if it is not lighting at all. Or a dirty sensor rod if the pilot heats and you get flame for seven seconds then goes out. <br>  <br>  If it doesn't look like it is trying to light at all it could also be a pressure switch or even a tripped safety.  <br>  <br>  But obviously you do not sound mechanical enough to address it yourself and will need help or a tech. <br>  <br>  Sorry to tell ya.|`|0RuNbOGlaa	Unless you're familiar with electronic circuits, call a serviceman.<br>  If by chance you have some electrical knowledge, start by checking the primary circuit, that is, power to the furnace.

A lot of things to check, and all require some electrical experience.   Good luck.<br>   One other thing look in the burner compartment, and see if there is any form of reset buttons near the burners, if so, one or more may have been activated due to flame bow back.  Usually they just look like a small electrical button, so press to reset.|`|lERouzRYaa	I have a Carrier furnace also. Some have a sensor that causes the burner not to light when the metal cover is off the unit or improperly seated after you change the filter.

0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	Many hedging plants eg Buxus (Boxwood), Euonymous, privet etc are easy to grow from cuttings. <br>  <br>  For buxus I usually take semi ripe cuttings (not the soft top bit, and not the brittle bit at the bottom, the middle semi soft part of the stem).  You can do this from late summer to late autumn.  I usually make the cuttings about 4" long, make sure you know which is the top bit and which is the bottom (usually done by cutting the top of straight and the bottom off on an angle or vice versa (you don't want to plant them upside  down).  The leaves will root from the lumps on the stem where the leaves join on (nodes).  Trim the bottom of the cutting just below one of these joining points cut the cutting off at approx 4".  I strip all the leaves of bar a few at the very top.  Dip the cutting into rooting compound or honey use a stick to make a hole in the compost you are going to grow the plant in, carefully put the cutting in the compost so you don't knock the rooting compound off.  Push the compost against the cutting to hold it upright.  Keep doing this till you fill up a pot of cutting (you can make quite a few).  Water the compost well and gently.  I then put a few sticks into the pot and place an upturned bag over the pot (the sticks are to stop the plant material touching the bag), and put a large rubber band around the bag which holds it onto the pot (make sure it is secure with no holes or gaps for moisture to get out).  You now have a mini hot house.  Place the covered pot in a very shaded position.  Every week water and replace the cover on the pot.  After 6-8 weeks they should be rooted,  don't be in a rush though ,let them get going then pot up into individual pots (no covers) in the shade to grow to the next size.<br>  <br>  The main thing is be careful with your hygiene,  Wash any pots with a 10% bleach solution before use (kills fungal diseases etc) and also use the same solution on you secatours.  Some plants will die so make  lots of extras.  I find a 50 /50 mix of peat moss and sand works well for me, but you can use propagating mix if available.  Its very rewarding to do and lots of fun.|`|EiKNx5hkaa	I think it depends on the type of hedge.  When i was a kid and getting interested in gardening I used to take cuttings from a neighbors privet hedge (new growth) and put them in a glass of water and they would grow roots relatively quickly.  You can also buy rooting hormone (Rootone) to help stimulate growth.
grtYBZoVaa	Sorry, but that's an ambiguous question. The genus Spiraea, common name Spirea, has many species, and dozens of varieties. The simple answer to how big do they grow, is how big do you want them to grow? All are deciduous, and all can be pruned at will.<br>  <br>  On the smaller side, like 'Shirobana,' 'Anthony Waterer,' 'Little Princess,' they get around 4' x 4' if not pruned.<br>  <br>  Compare this with  Vanhouttei (result of a cross between S. trilobata and S. cantoniensis) at 6'-8' tall and a spread up to 12.'<br>  <br>  As far as fertilizer?

xl6JVATSaa	Delete the old setting and re-enter the original used when the door was first activated. I know they are both the same but the one you are using now has become corrupted
4uike3ARaa	Tent the house first. The longer you wait, the more you have to repair. The damage repairs can occur at the same time as the new roof is going on, unless some of the damage is in the roof structure, in which case you'll want those taken care of first.<br>  The exterior paint job goes next. Doing the painting before you install gutters means that much less that you'll have to cut around. It will also get a good coat of paint on behind the gutters.<br>  That's my take on your honey do list.|`|xl6JVATSaa	Tent, other wise any termites you do have will only transfer to the new work|`|XTDeAfTqaa	Bulldoze the place and start from scratch!|`|J4W68owgaa	Here's the order I would go in:<br>  <br>  1. Termites first. No point in putting on a new roof if the little buggers are just going to eat it.<br>  <br>  2. Damage repairs. This way, all the termites should be gone/dead, but in the process if you find any, you can call the place back to re-tent.<br>  <br>  3. Roof/Gutters- Water leaks are a big deal and you'll want to take care of that. Might as well put up new gutters while you're up there.<br>  <br>  4. Paint/Gutters- You could do gutters either with the roof or with the paint. If you don't want to have to work around them while you paint, do them while you paint. Otherwise, I'd leave painting until last. <br>  <br>  <br>  If your roof has a few leaks, do a patch job for now. if you have bare wood exposed on the house, paint those areas until you can do the complete house, but that is the order I would do them all in.<br>  <br>  Good luck
wKQbNvm9aa	I thought this was a good question.  I googled 'full spectrum cfl bulb' and there do seem to be some out there.  I think they may be expensive.

AA11118886	Do you mean the clear plastic tubes you put a floor plan and information in when you are selling a house?? You can find them at Home Depot or Lowe's with the for sale signs.<br>  <br>  Other than that one, I know of no other type.|`|1fa7940c26aa4389aeef7742698bef0caa	try ace or i know true value hardeware stores carry them we sell them on mothly specials all the time and they come in a number of sizes

Now rotate the nail 45 to 60 degrees toward the second piece of wood and drive it home. <br>  <br>  When doing studs on a bottom plate I'll prop my foot against the other side of the stud to keep it in place. I will use 6 7d nails on that connection, two in each side and one on each end.|`|hFODOj7laa	Predrill a pilot hole on angle then nail.

r71znI08aa	My wife called to see what it was about. They will not tell you any fee over the phone, they want you to visit their showroom. Also from what I learned once they have you there you either buy then or you are no longer eligible for the program. the nearest showroom to us is in Jacksonville Fl which is over an hour. If you flip houses or building your own then the price may be worth it. They do have a web site you can visit.|`|AA10948208	$4000 fee.|`|2c05a77dd585634d1f7a716fc442edfeaa	I thought about it but did not think it was worth it. Some of my friends saw it to but discarded the idea as well.<br>  <br>  Didn't feel as good as they tried to make it sound.|`|4GDR0F49aa	I checked into it a couple of years ago. I couldn't find any savings! After the membership fees the prices were still high for most of the products I saw. I am a general contractor/home builder and I have found that nobody beats high volume retailers on price most of the time.

x1eXQNGJaa	Hair spray will take ink out of anything... spray a generous amount on the stain, and use an old toothbrush to scrub... rinse with cold water, and repeat again until the stain is removed.  Good Luck!!|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I doubt it but you can try spraying hair spray on them & letting it set a bit.|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	I use Energine which is a petroleum cleaner for spot cleaning.  I bought my last can (size of lighter fluid) from Longs Drugstore.  It's usually found in the section with laundry soaps and other cleaning supplies.   It's banned in some communities now though.  I think it's bad for the environment or a carcinogen -- or both.<br>  <br>  But I put some of that liquid full strength on the spot and place clean towel under the stain and over the stain I press hard.  Then I add more spot cleaner and press again.  That usually pushes the ink through the fabric on to the towel under the stain I'm working on.  Sometimes I work a long time on it and that usually lightens it significantly -- if it doesn't completely remove the ink.  Don't rub, instead use a pressing motion so you don't weaken the clothing fibers.|`|Hyx3PF62aa	No, not really. Wants it been dried in a dryer, its usually a permanent stain.<br>  <br>  But you could make something of them anyways. Go to a fabric or craft store and makes something of the denim. You could paint a design or just go crazy like that. Make it interesting if the stain really bothers you... <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :O)
