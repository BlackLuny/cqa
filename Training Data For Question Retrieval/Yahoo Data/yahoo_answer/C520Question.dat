She needs constant care, we have to change her diapers and tube feed her and suction her lungs, etc...Even though I visited her in the hospital every day while she was there, I do not know what to do with her now that she's back at home, she's completely helpless...we can't do a lot of the things that we used to do together. I know she feels very sad and I want to keep her entertained and in good spirits because she can't do anything on her own. What are some things I could do with her on a daily basis? We're 17.

20090203113710AARWz0r	Health;Mental Health	Can Bipolar go like this? Do you think that its just depression and anxiety. Does depression make you angry?	Can the high be a persistent high for like 6 months and then it be at a extreme low for a year? Can each be in long periods of time and then sometimes in between have short episodes by week by week?       Do you think that its just depression and anxiety. Does depression make you angry?  Oh my godddd!!!!!    I feel annoyed for no reason at all.I feel agitated.  Lately the little things in life piss me off... like when someone isn't understanding what I said or if they ask me to repeat what I said because they fail to pay attention.I get so snappy.Everyone annoys me lately.When I get upset with someone I end saying things that I really don't mean,I end up feeling guilty but cant stop.I don't feel depressed I feel more empty and almost kind of numb.I have no interest in things that I once did.My mind is always thinking and thinking and thinking.I feel out of it. I cant sleep because of energy and then I need to sleep and cant and once I do I have a hard time waking up.I feel tired one sec and then a adrenalin rush the next. When I get a lack of sleep I end up feeling worse.    I was diagnosed with postpartum after the baby was born due to the racing thoughts and anxiety and lack of interest in the baby at first.I have a lack of interest in everything.  The only thing that ever makes me happy is shopping and now that doesnt even work and that was all that was left.    I feel so fatigue almost if I have every damn prob in the book but I know my main problem is this. Any ideas?    This has kinda been going off and on since I turned 14 but never this bad.    I cant afford a psych anymore so all I have is my primary and she prescribed me effexor xr and said its depression and anxiety. The first night of taking it I felt pressure behind my right eye and a rapid heart beat...It scared me and I stopped it.    Do you think that its just postpartum depression and anxiety. Does depression make you angry?    My primary is not a psych so I do not know if she is diagnosing me right.    My past four years have been like this...    Happy to the point that I was so happy I couldn't sleep and all I would think about was how much I love jesus and couldn't sleep and would wake up in night terrors.Thennnn it when from that to a numb state for a while.After that... it went from a state where I couldn't sleep would think all night and feel anxiety and walk around the high school at four in the morning waiting to talk on thee phone because I was so damn addicted to it.Then there was a long period where I couldn't get myself out of bed and would sleep all day, I would be invited to big events that anyone would want to go to and just couldn't get out of bed.After that I was extremely happy looked my best and was too full of my self ( I was very self confident)and happy, I made tons of friends and made tons of bad mistakes I had no conscience. I now have a baby and ever since his birth I have been feeling really mixed.    All of these things were in long periods of time not week by week.      I was diagnosed along time ago when I was so depressed that I was in rage... I was very angry and would cut.I had to go to the hospital.I was on abilify ,lithium, and lexapro.I ended up having a very bad close to fatel reaction to abilify and quit them all and felt fine.Thats when I went into that happy state so I thought all was good.I went to a psych and they said all I have is postpartum and GAD.They said hospitals tend to over medicate people and that was in my past. Oh yeah and I don't cut anymore and I don't even know why I did.          I have just been feeling every dang emotion it seems like lately .Its hard to explain. Like all at once.I'm verrrrry irritable. My body Is also taking a toll .,I feel weak and Im always tired.

If it helps I've kept the piercing clean(when it was healing and months after) Would it be advisable to remove the piercing or would it be better to leave it in? (I'm asking on here because the doctors I've seen seem to know little to nothing about piercings and infections(they know a lot about the infection generally, however).

20090222200810AAxWP6n	Health;Men's Health	Has the "average" size of a male increased? (Mature)?	Me and my girlfriend were talking on the phone the other day, and previously a week ago we were fooling around at my house and she saw "me". She claims that I was huge or "too big", and that was a real ego-booster, until she told me about her friends boyfriends. I wont lie, I'm 6 1/2 in. She told me that her friends boyfriends are around 8-9, all 17 years old, and its been bothering me ever since. I know its very typical for a man to be worried of his most favored organ, but it still gets to me thinking that I'm not enough, and my girlfriends verification that i am isn't making me feel better. I just need to know.   Thank you

I haven't told her, but I have these terrible urges to start all over again. After every time, I realize that I shouldn't even feel that way, but the feeling of mandatory punishment returns. My urges last a really long time, and every time I look at scissors I have an almost uncontrollable urge to cut myself. (I used to cut with scissors.) I want to tell my counselor but I know she'll have to tell my parents, and then everything will start all over again. All the pain, hurt, disgust, ignorance, distrust, anger, and depression will begin again. I know how much this hurts them, so I don't tell anyone. All my feelings are so bottled up, and I always feel like I'm going to let go and either relapse, or tell everything to the wrong person. I feel almost relieved when I see my own blood now, which even torments me. What the heck is wrong with me?

So even though I am eating too little amount of calories but I am getting well enough protein, will I still lose my lean muscle tissue? I dont want to hear that 800 calories is too little and i will go into starvation mode and whatever cause I really do know all that, but im serious about this and I just want to get a really big kick start and get a big weight loss taken care of so i can just be my happy weight and eat really healthy. So I am going to just make a healthy lifestyle change I just want to get this hard part over with. Can someone give me information that helps because I dont want to lose my lean muscle! thanks to all who help!!!

Hi,       I have a dentist appointment in a few days (Wed to be exact- today’s Mon) and my oral hygienist asked me if I had my antibiotics to take before my appointment...      and I said, ohh I don’t take those anymore...   she was like... oh you have to…   and I told her... that my previous dentist, said  no longer need to take those meds       (this new dentist just opened up near by, lots of technology crap, and cosmetic stuff, so I switched)      Anywhoo the hygienist said that she wanted me to come in Monday morning to talk to me. The thing is I wrote down on my application that I have no know heart conditions, but I have heart murmur. Yes, I know why... the reason I did that was because I didn’t want to have to get meds from my doctor. But I guess that my mom told the one time, it came up in a conversation.       Plus my last dentist told me that people no longer need to take antibiotics, so I wasn’t worried. It wasn’t till recently that my hygienist talked to my dentist, and they said that was a study in American, nothing finalized.             The deal with me and my family doctor is, we got into a little fight lmaoo were close friends even thought I’m 19, and he’s like 38 our family goes back. So I haven’t been to him in like 1year. He's called the house, every time I went to the walk-in clinic for something like a bad cold, or bad rash from my friends cat.... just to make sure all was good. I guess they send the papers over to his office… uhhh... to try and make a long story short lol.. I don’t want to go to him just yet... probably next month.. cuz I need him to send me to a heart specialist.. just lately my heart has been beating really fast.. outta know where... like once a week.. when it does that it hurts for a bit like 20secs then its gone.. but that cant be good…:P      But I’d have to go to him to get papers saying that I don’t need meds anymore, but I’m think I’m just going to ask my hygienist to call the drug store, and ask them to prepare my meds. Without having to go to my doctor. Do you think that’d work?      I don’t really know what I’m trying to ask, I just have lots going on and any comments and advice would be greatly appricated...

20090222211427AAluOHy	Health;Mental Health	Is it bad to cut yourself if it makes you happy?	I cut myself sometimes. Whenever I'm feeling really depressed I'll make a small cut on my body somewhere. It helps me think clearly about whatever problem I'm having, and it makes me feel better. Like I'm fixing the problem. So I don't see what's so bad about it. I don't make like really deep wounds or anything, mostly just long shallow cuts (not on my wrists).      So am I just crazy in thinking that it isn't bad? I honestly don't see how cutting myself is really bad. No one at school thinks I'm depressed because I get rid of depression at home by cutting. So what's so bad about it?

It first happened when I had sex with my boyfriend, my vaginal region became sore and bled a little and it burned when I used the bathroom. It seems a little better, but still not right. It seems like my skin all the way at the back of my vaginal opening is split or cracked. I was wondering if this is normal and if anyone knows what it may be. I am going to make a doctor appointment but I am still scared and embarrassed. And for all the people who may say it is an STD it is not because my boyfriend and I lost our virginity to eachother and are both loyal. Thanks for your help.

Then when I can't stand the itchiness, I seek skin specialist advice which the Dr. also doesn't know the cause of it but did provide me with some medication & a Pinetarsol medicated bath gel to be taken. However, after few weeks of using, I'm still having the same itchiness. So this time, I thought perhaps the water in my area has to do with my skin. So, I'm starting to use filter water & see how it goes. Please give me advice if anyone of u out there knows how I could get rid of my whole body itchiness. TQ

I'm 21, male, 180. 5'7      I was very skinny my whole life up until 7th grade, when for no reason at all, without changing my diet I just suddenly started putting on weight real fast. But I put on a ton of fat weight, then maintained about that level all the way through high school no matter what I tried. I finally decided to go all out and loose it when I graduated.      I wasn't gigantic, but I was about 220 and 5'6''. I started eating tons of vegetables, fruit, increased fiber, cut out all soda and junk, and started walking, but I was hardly loosing. So finally I cut my diet down to about 500 calories a day(1 can of soup, 1 TV dinner), which was only 1/4 of my healthy suggested amount, but thats the only way I could loose.      It took me a year on this diet to go from 220 to 140, but I still had a bit of chub on me, so I started to try tone my muscle, then I just got to a plateau, and couldn't get rid of the last rolls of fat to feel finished, then after about a month I started gaining, and gaining, now I'm back up to 180, and climbing, I cant diet anymore, and I'm already using the treadmill daily and going on nightly walks.      I want to increase my calories to a healthy amount, but if I do I'll gain all the weight back and more, so I'm completely stuck!      Any suggestions are very helpful!      My diet consists of mainly soup, salads, and small 200 calorie TV dinners. I don't use salad dressings, I don't eat any bread, I only drink water. I do yard work, walk on the treadmill, and I'm still gaining.

They feel like they constantly need to be stretched and/or moving.  I stretch them constantly but it doesn't really help.  My bf has tried to massage them, which helps but after a few minutes they feel the same way like before.      I've had this for many years, but only recently is it preventing me from sleeping.  Before I would just jiggle my legs or put them in awkward angles to stretch the muscles until I went to sleep.  This isn't working anymore, and I feel more often than not I am relying on OTC sleeping pills to get to sleep.      I have seen a doctor, I've recently had a physical and the only problem I have is a vitamin B12 deficiency, which I am currently getting shots for.  I talked to the doctor about my sleeping problem and she recommended I take the OTC sleeping pills, and if those didn't work to go back to see her.  They work but even after taking a half-pill, I am really drowsy the next day.  I sleep but I do not feel well-rested the next day, and this prevents me from getting anything done.

20070316163955AATSbkY	Health;Diet & Fitness	Lifting Question?	Ok I do 8 sets of 200 lbs bench press (first set I put up 11 reps, 2nd set I put up 6, after that the rest 6 sets I get it up to 5 reps). *All of which is completed in 15 mins* Is this routine enough for me to keep gaining muscle in the designated area or should I add more weight? (I mean doing the same weight from this point on, but gradually increase the reps & sets, would this w/out increasing weight increase muscle size & strenght?)      -Thanks a bunch

On Valentine's Day, I slammed my pinky finger under my car trunk.  "How?," you ask.  Well, I was putting my shopping bags in my trunk and was looking for the closest cart return area and thought my finger was safely away from my trunk, but I was wrong.  I was lucky that I didn't break my finger.  I was only mm away from that tragedy.  Anyways, my finger throbbed like hell and bruised up very quickly, follwed by swelling.  Shortly after, there was blood filled underneath my nail, and then 2 days later, it was so swelled with blood that my skin under my nail tore and spurted out blood.  So I squeezed the trapped blood and a day later, the swelling went down drastically and it's almost back to normal now, except my finger feels kindda weird-like somewhat numb at the tip and top of my nail.  Well, I've kept it clean and soaked it in hydrogen peroxide, but I found that my nail lifts almost all the way up.  I think it's just hanging by a very small amount of flesh.  Do you think it will grow back, or will I totally lose my nail?      For those of you who ask why I haven't seen a Doc yet, well, I didn't want to run to docs for every little thing and figured it'll eventually heal it's self, but I'll also tell you that I am trying to find a doc who's available to see me right away tomorrow or very soon.  I called a little late last week and couldn't get in, and forget about the ER.  I don't want to wait 8-10 hours to be seen for a nail.      Thanks for your help!

So what i am wondering is if this is normal and im not sure if i actually had the "initial" breakout in the first place. Also i am wondering if i can pop the acne or would it make scars? If i wasn't to pop them the would be cut by my shaver in the morning.    Please help and thanx in advance                                                                      cheers

Hi,      I've been to Japan several times and have come across several times this "medical" instrument that looks like chopsticks, but have some form of incence burning inside...it heats up the tips making them almost red... and you rub it on your skin, your head, your arms... to help blood circulation. Everytime I try remember it's name but always forget. If you know what I'm talking about then you probably know what it is; for those who don't I'm probably talking nonsense. The "chopsticks" (steel?) and connected at the top, so they are twinned. It's a bit like a natural/soothing therapeutic instrument. Hope I've given enough details! Thank you!

I've been getting a chest pain...first let me say that I have went to 2 different doctors and gotten X-rays and EKG's and they have said nothing is wrong with my heart.      First off...Its usually a sharp pain that varies in its location. Sometimes its on the right side of chest under the chest blade and right below the armpit. Sometimes its on the left side.  Sometimes its even in my back.  The pain has also been accompanied by spasm in my body. (I don't know of spasm is the correct word for what I am experiencing so I will decribe it: It feels like a vain is vibrating very fast or twitching) These spasms are in face (like around the cheek, jaw, mouth) and more commonly in the neck. Sometimes it feels like my neck suddenly tightens along with the spasm.      Doctors are saying nothing is wrong with me...but I feel like there is. The pain is very intense at times....and usually occurs about 5-6 hours after i have woken up and gets more intense through out the day. any advice?

20090203124321AA4aDtW	Health;Other - Health	Pain in joints after I run?	Recently I started running 3km about 4 nights a week. This route takes me about 20 mins. on rough snowy icy terrain. For the first few times I did have very minor muscle pain as a result of not stretching. However, now that this has gone away, a new problem has arisen! The other day after my run my joints were in bad pain to the point where it was hard for me to move and I avoided standing up or walking. I wear a pair of Puma shoes that do not offer very much support when I run, although they are technically "running shoes". I also wear orthotics, that were prescribed, but not for any serious reason at all (they were free so why not!) I was just curious if there are any remedies I can take (such as glucosomine?) that will ease the pressure on my joints. As well, can anyone suggest a very good pair of running shoes that offer optimal support? Price is not an issue. Thank you so much in advance.

20070814220510AAiuvoj	Health;Mental Health	Does this sound like bipolar disorder?	Over the past 3 yrs, I've been diagnosed with depression and then later with OCD, and then just recently with anxiety disorder, and have taken meds but I'm not taking any at the moment.      My mom is bipolar and pretty much everyone in my family has some mental problem.      Sometimes I feel down and just like sleeping.  I never feel like reading or doing a lot of things that I used to love.  I don't go out as much.      I do have times when I get a bit of motivation to do stuff - periods of a day or even just a few hours when I get EVERYTHING done - sometimes till 4 in the AM getting stuff organized because I don't feel like sleeping.  But then I go back to the lazy.      Right now I'm feeling more like the latter but I still feel unmotivated and like my head is cloudy and unfocused.  I'm very paranoid and have a lot of issues with worrying about getting a disease (I keep a medical book by my bed that I flip through constantly whenever I get any pain/discomfort).  I also have phobias.      Any ideas?

I have a list of homework that never gets done. As I struggle to get it finished, it gets bigger daily. It is like a horror that never leaves me. I need it to jot down my homework but as I see it, it is terrifying.       I feel so anxious for an answer. I need help. I have no life because of this problem ( I stay at home all day, every day). I feel like I have no solution anymore. for example I have a literary notebook and essay due today but they're too difficult for me. I need some help and I can't find it anywhere (not even the internet is helping). That's just adding on to my stress because now my teacher is going to tell me something bad and I'm going to feel the shower of disappointment from him and from myself for being incompetent.       I am capable of doing the work given, but there is never enough time for me to relax. My friends don't even get to see me during breaks or lunch because I'm always inside the classroom doing homework or studying. Please help. I feel so desperate for a solution.      I just came back recently to school after a week long absence due to this problem. It is affecting me in everyway possible. My health is suffering (lack of sleep, increased heartrate due to stress, nerve twitching), my life is suffering (no time for myself, not even an hour), my grades are suffering. I'm losing faith in myself. I feel like I have no hope left in the form of an answer. Please don't disappoint me Yahoo Answers. I need only helpful and necessary answers. I can't handle this anymore. I'm going to burn out.

He has not been helpful on things when it comes to their home or relationship.  I ask them if they are willing to seek counseling and they say there is nothing more to say. (Been married for35yrs).  I try to help but that doesn't work because I have seizures & she doesn't want me to worry about things.  She is not sleeping and that is partially to blame for her being so fragile.  Does anyone know if she is suffering from some medical disorder or is she just to stressed out.  What else can I do to help her relax and not worry so much? Help?

My daughter has several medical conditions (corrected heart defect, Downs), and she is very small for 2 1/3 years old.

I asked her genetisist about this before but he didn't seem too concerned  about it. I love like crazy but I am very worried about her size being that she will be starting preshcool in a year and worry about if she'll be big enough to start on time.

According to the seller, I should take Cell-Tech Hardcore Creatine when I wake up and right after every work out. It says that in the label.      About the naNO Vapor (Muscletech), he told me to use it before every work out. It says that in the label also.      About the 100% Whey Protein, he told me to take two shakes a day. One before going to bed and the other one as a snack during the day. Or take the second shake one hour after I take the Creatine after my work out.      The thing is I am confused. I've heard that the creatine should be taken before every work out and the protein after work outs.      So if you have experience with these three products, Could you please give me a suggestion about how to use them together and correctly?      Thanks!!!

20080330124125AAGwYew	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Gallbladder? or something else...?	I have had pain behind my lower right ribcage for some time now. It sometimes hurts directly around to my back. On and off I feel 'full' or 'bloated' with frequent gas and burps. I sometimes have heartburn or my whole stomach feels upset. Lately whenever I have physical activity, like going to dance I have severe sharp pain under my right ribs and feel sick. Caffeine or rich foods seem to make it worse, I once thougt I had a lactose problem, but am wondering more and more if my problem may be more associated with my gallbladder? I am 22 years old but my mom had to have her gallbladder removed a few years back. Could I be suffering from the same problem, or does anyone have any other suggestions?  I am going to see the Dr. tommorrow, and am really nervous about it, because this has been going on for a while...and have never had any other medical problems.

20080727173839AAXjKLR	Health;Diet & Fitness	How many calories to eat per day?	My stats are 5'0, 16 years old, 96 lbs (I know it sounds small, but I'm too flabby), and very active. I use an elliptical for 35 minutes 6 times a week, burning 400 calories each time.       I tried a bunch of BMR calculators and some said, to maintain my weight, I should eat 1600 WITH the exercise I do whle others say I should eat somewhere closer to 2700. So I'm confused - How many should I eat?      BUT I'm currently working on trying to burn fat and gain muscle, so how many calories a day do I need to do that? I want to change my appearance, but not my weight - At least, I don't want it getting smaller.      I also do an hour pilates class every three days. Am I on the right track to getting rid of fat and gaining muscle?

20081109130128AAmCMYF	Health;Women's Health	Functional Cyst vs Complex Cyst?	In late August I had severe abdominal pain on my right side.  I ended up going to the emergency room, only to get a male doctor who did all the blood work for an appendix and other severe abdominal issues, but told me to call my "woman" doctor and be seen within 72 hours.  I went to my gynecologist who is on a military base, and she said she felt a cyst and thought she had ruptured it.  She ordered a blood pregnancy test and an ultrasound.  The ultrasound took place two weeks later on a Wednesday.  I was told I would get the results back around Monday which I thought was a long time.  I was still in pain and contacted my doctor informing her that I thought it was a long time to wait, she agreed and sent me off post to someone that would have quicker appointments for ultrasounds etc.  I was called by the off care doctor's nurse with the results of my ultrasound performed on base and told it was a functional cyst and to come back for another ultrasound when my cycle started.  I did, but the ultrasoundist at provider off base told me it was a complex cyst.  She then reviewed the report from the radiologist on base and told me that he too had said it was complex.  I told her I was told it was functional and she said it certainly was not.  It is 1.5 cm, the same as noted on base solid mass.  She told me the doctor would be calling me to schedule an appointment and discuss surgery.  I didn't hear from the doctor so I called and spoke with the same nurse that had given me the first results.  She told me AGAIN it was a functional cyst.  I told her I was confused and told her two radiologist felt it was complex, and she told me that the doctor felt differently and she's the one who makes the final call.  I spoke with my doctor on base who looked up the report and told me once again she agreed it was complex.  She won't see me however since she sent me off base.  I was able to FINALLY get an appointment with the provider off base who wants to give me birth control to shrink the cyst, even thought with a complex cyst it won't do anything for it.  My appointment is this week and I'm very worried on how to approach her and ask her why she is saying it's the opposite than two radiologist have said it was.  Also, the second radiologist thought it was a dermoid cyst.  Is there anything I should ask them to perform like a CA- 125 blood test?  A pap smear?  It has now been three months, I'm still in pain and shouldn't have to be stressed on if my doctor is misdiagnosing me!  Help!

20090222161619AAAKnAB	Health;Other - Health	How can I love myself if I don't like what I've become?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

I am in an exclusive relationship and I have suspected my partner of cheating for quite some time now.  All of the sudden, now I am having some irritation, to say the least, and I have a doctors appointment in the morning.  I have asked if he has been with anyone else and he says he hasn't but I don't believe him.  He also has a violent temper which leaves me to wonder what he will do if the doc says that I have something and I confront him about it? When I told him I was going to the doc he also started asking a lot of questions along the lines of when the irritation started, which left me wondering is he trying to match a date with a face?
20090203131125AAPMKEA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What is going on with all these symptoms?!?	Hey all,      I thought I would ask this question on here, to HOPEFULLY get some insight.  I am two weeks late for my period.  I took 2 pregnancy tests recently and got negatives on both.  I read some other answers that said maybe the hormone levels won't be enough to read until 3 or 4 weeks late.  I have been off the pill for a little over a year and I am 24.  I've had relatively regular periods until now.  I have never been this late. I have been stressed but usually I am, and I have changed my diet.      However, I have also been feeling a lot of symptoms that could be due to a lot of things.  Fatigue is the top one... I always feel tired.  My muscles get tired out easily and I always want to sleep.  I have been irritable a lot for no reason.  I always get the "nesting" instinct before my periods and I have been cleaning like crazy and wanting a new pet suddenly.  My lower back hurts sometimes like when I am on a period.  My breasts don't hurt but my chest feels tight all the time.  Sometimes I have a pain where my ovaries are.      My aunt said maybe a cyst, my mom thinks I have thyroid, someone suggested kydney trouble for the back.       Anyone dealt with a lot of symptoms like this that can give me insight?         I know I should go to a doc, but I don't have any money yet and want to calm my brain down.

I was walking up a very large hill, and the snow was about 3-4 feet deep so it was a struggle.  I was breathing heavier and heavier but when I got to the top it was a different kind of not being able to breath. I almost felt like I was being choked.  I could barely get any air into my lungs, I almost passed out from the lack of air.  I started breathing deeply through my nose and out through my mouth and after about 5 minutes it went away.  Did I have and asthma attack?  Perhaps due to the cold? (I was also very frustrated, so perhaps stress triggered something?)
