t33FrBA6aa	There are two things that jump out at me from your graph.<br>  One, that the data taken at the turn of the century (1900's) may not have had enough info to accurately show what was happening.<br>  Two, that the increase of human activity has had an effect on the environment, especially with floods. The more people, the more land is used for housing. The less nature can handle the rising water, and the more of an impact rising water has on people.<br>  Additionally, some catastrophes have no correlation to man's activities - volcanoes, shifting plate tectonics, and earthquakes. Even tsunamis are not the result of man made events.<br>  However, mankind ought to rethink what we are doing. Instead of sprawling out, build up. Instead of large families, keep them small. Instead of large farms, build growing centers with multiple floors and use solar panels and wind turbines to produce the electricity to light the plant lights. Productivity goes way up, disease of the plants, and insect infestation diminishes, and the food is year round.|`|5mo8k7uzaa	This is a perfect example of a graph designed and manipulated to show exactly what the creater wants: that due to global warming the world is becoming chaotic. LIES. ABSOLUTE NONSENSE.<br>  <br>  What you don't see in this graph are all the years already gone in which this kind of thing happened. Allow me to explain: The Earth has a cycle that repeats every 80,000 years. For approximately 70,000 years there is an ice age, then, for the following 10,000 years, there is a warm period where the earth gets warmer and warmer. If the graph stretched back further you would see exactly the same thing except over a longer time period. Global warming is not a myth by any standards but it is complete crap that it is caused by humans. <br>  <br>  Rereading your question, yes - there is an increase in natural disasters but it's in no way related to humanitys actions on this earth. It is completely natural and has happened many times over in the past millions of years. :) And it's not the increased population thats causing these things. We just hear more about them as more people are affected due to the larger population.<br>  <br>  Sorry for ranting. :)|`|t1zlbOURaa	What effects the frequency of disasters?<br>  <br>  Wider news coverage.

It isn't particularly significant and it isn't evidence of increase hurricanes or floods.|`|zince8g1aa	There have been increases in floods, droughts, and intense hurricanes due to global warming, although the large graph isn't necessarily the best evidence of it, since it's partially a factor of growing world population covering more areas.  <br>  <br>  The smaller graph is a bit more revealing.  It plots disasters reported since 1980 and compares earthquakes with climate-related disasters.  Notice that floods (a key global warming projection) have increased dramatically while non-climate-related earthquake reporting has remained stable.  This suggests that it's more than demographics-related.  I'd like to see them plot droughts as well and perhaps high-intensity hurricanes.|`|0ENFApaAaa	I think it is completely meaningless.  The quantities (floods, disasters, earthquakes)  are not defined.  If I bump my car while parking is that a disaster ?  If the washing machine springs a leak is that a flood ?

AA11500132	In the UK there have been strong controls on building outside settlement boundaries since the 2nd World War.<br>  The local planing authority will have a Local Development Framework that goes out for public comment and will prioritise brown field sites etc. Most are now implementing "settlement hierachies" that will prevent development even in small villages that have lost services like schools & post offices.<br>  <br>  Also there are now more wild flowers and wildlife in "urban" gardens than in the green deserts of the UK agro-business countryside.<br>  <br>  Please check with the local planning office in your district or borough or unitary council before believing the newspaper stories of the countryside being concreted over. The editors just want to ensure no-one builds any affordable housing for local people near their 2nd/3rd homes. And it is an easy scaremonger tactic to sell more papers.|`|DV4xyeChaa	heck in the UK they regulate everything else..why not green or lack of..|`|8SjpwLNSaa	You're believing too much of what you see/hear in the media. There are vast swathes of unspoilt countryside in the UK for example, Yorkshire, where I live and the West Country. Those are only 2 examples of unspoilt countryside. <br>  In any case, councils don't give planning permission as easily nowadays because of the concerns for the environment. There is certainly far less development where I live than there was, say 30 years ago, and when there is development, the building companies have to abide by stricter rules in terms of the appearance and number of houses they can build outside cities and towns nowdays.|`|w8Wl1d0xaa	We sure are worrying about the same thing,this also is a no-go green issue...the more they build and use fields the more they ruin the world and ppl get sick and get asthma,people need fresh air and the only place to get fresh air is a green area where lots of trees sway and give out oxygen.<br>  <br>  hope that helps =)|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Yeah it's a big concern all over the world. Even if you're not "green" you should be concerned as all of our best farm land is just outside cities (that's why the city was built there). As cities expand, we lose our best farm land.<br>  <br>  Development practices need to change to encourage high-density living and discourage suburbs. It'd also help if the population stopped growing. It's not going to be easy to change these things though because people don't like being told that they can't follow the American dream of a big house in the suburbs with a ginormous lawn.

We're not on the verge of catastrophe, despite rumors to the contrary.  I'm guessing you're too young to remember the 1980s panic over the impending ice age, which was being caused by auto emissions and aerosol sprays.  We were told the planet would be uninhabitable within 20 years if we didn't make draconian changes immediately.  Once that was forgotten, the same scientists decided to generate more panic by announcing that global warming would make the planet uninhabitable within 20 years if we didn't make draconian changes immediately.  When communism fell, its proponents flocked to environmentalism as their new cause, since it's really about world socialism and not safeguarding the planet.  That's why they're so quick to shut down scientists who offer evidence that the world is not in freefall.  Where free speech is allowed to flourish, socialists find it hard to establish a foothold.<br>  <br>  If you do some independent research, you'll find out much of what you've learned in school is propaganda.

Al Gore, Sting and Bono travel in private jets, own multiple power-sucking mansions, and still have the gall to claim your humble 4-cylinder car is responsible for starvation in Africa.

No wonder he got so fat, with all that butter on both sides of his bread.<br>  <br>  Follow the money and don't believe what you're told until you confirm it through independent research.

Nature pollutes too - volcanoes, wild fires, ect...<br>  Second, not everyone is disrespectful of nature, and try to minimize their impact on the environment. If this were not so, then there would not be any groups trying to undo the effects of others.<br>  Third, nature is also a source of climate change. There was a mini-ice age from the 1300's through the 1800's. Prior to that there was an overly warm period of about 300 years.<br>  I worry more about war, famine, and disease.<br>  These are the things which we could prevent, but wars are constantly with us, we play god with diseases, and do not work at solving famine.<br>  As for, "Will we parish?" Perhaps, but in truth, there may be little we can do about this. To some extent we are responsible for our fate. But in other ways, our fate may have little to do with our actions. However, I do wish others make less of a mess of the earth, but that does not stop me from doing all that I can. You too can do all you can, and maybe together, all of us can keep changing the actions of others.<br>  As for "Do we deserve to perish?" No

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Daylight saving time is ALL rhetoric. It has been shown that in spite of Bush and every other of his cronies who pushed for the change as an "energy saving" measure, it is still a bogus claim. The only "saving" is in time shifting WHEN the energy is USED, not that there is a decrease in AMOUNT. The electric light you delay turning on in the evening is replaced with having the light on early in the morning. The energy you used to use for an hour at night is now shifted to the early morning. It saves nothing in that the light is STILL on for an hour, but instead of being ON in the evening, it is ON during breakfast. That 100 watt light bulb draws 100 watts regardless of the time of day when it is on. The difference MIGHT be in you electric bill, though, as SOME utility companies charge a graduated progressive scale which looks at your electrical load in real time with a smart meter and charges more for a kilowatt-hour during peak times than for a kilowatt-hour in off-peak times. My utility company tried it. They installed smart meters in the place where I live, and for a while, they even had a web site where you could read the data from your own meter in real time. You could actually see the pennies running up on your bill. I programmed my home thermostat to never use power during peak times unless the house down to 55 degrees. I timeshifted my use of home heat from daytime to nighttime and used a sweater during the day so I paid the least for the electricity I used. With the progressing real time billing by the minute, my bill jumped 25%, literally overnight. The problem was that it was more trouble than it was worth for the utility company to adjust the billing every minute of every day. And, they were challenged in court to prove their billing was accurate by producing a continuous paper trail, and what saving they might have achieved with the variable use billing, was lost when they were forced to document every customer's usage trail to justify the bill. Like me, a LOT of people experienced a significant change in the bill in favor of the electric company, which did NOT look good for the utility company, making it look more like it was a way around the state regulated rates .to effectively raise the rates. So, they dropped the progressive hourly billing and went back to simple quantity rates of before. Personally, I have never seen the use for daylight saving time. Sure, I admit that there are times when having nightfall come later in the day comes in handy, but that is merely for our convenience, not for any bogus claim of saving energy. It is a needless complication, and when Bush changed the dates, he made the automatic compensation in my digital clocks and VCR obsolete. I bought those particular devices so I did not have to manually change them, and then Bush with a stroke of a pen made me have to change the clocks myself, just like I had to before I bought the ones which changed themselves. I am all for dropping daylight saving completely, one time in each time zone for all and no changes. I doubt it will happen as too many politicians see the "energy saving" claim, though it has been shown to be baseless, as a vote winner.

All it takes is some pimple faced kid in St. Louis, to claim it's false data, and the yelling starts all over again. Do you really think that the SMARTEST SCIENTISTS in the WORLD are somehow fooling the WORLD, or ALL the  SMARTEST SCIENTISTS  in the WORLD are somehow being fooled by All Gore !      LOL !!|`|3d9bc8eab659ff6ebcf07fed820606c8aa	Global warming is a burning problem to us.  Earth temperature is increasing & it affects  nature to melt ice. If the large glaciers melt & water will be everywhere on earth..The existence of living beings will be finish on this earth.|`|WbiJxmYRaa	in my city, rain was 2 mnths late.the glaciers are melting
fp9bOiVFaa	They have a wide spectrum of available bottles. Some are just like Britta filters that you would use in an office setting. Some are camping filters that will remove all the particulate materials and make reasonable water (fast moving, not from where a beaver lives) safe. There was even just a bottled developed that removes pretty much everything. You could fill it with outhouse water and still be able to drink it. It's probably really expensive and will mostly be used by the army or in emergency response after disasters.<br>  <br>  So yeah, do your research on the particular bottle you're looking at and see if it suits your needs.|`|8N453TDfaa	I had to look these up. I've never heard of them but it sounds like a great idea!!  I can't answer your question, but I "think" it'd be more for just tap water -- not yucky creek/river water.  I might have to give these a try!!|`|YkI63LFZaa	i have a great price on a bag of air...interested?|`|AA11878029	I wouldn't trust them !!!

3NZV65alaa	Welcome to the asylum captain.<br>  I do not know which site you are referring to which says there has been no change.<br>  The only ones that I know about have shown a decrease since 1998 but not stable as your question seems to imply.<br>  The temperatures are certainly not increasing.<br>  The only 'Nuts' are those who refuse to acknowledge the facts.<br>  Another possibility is that by releasing true information they actually are nuts since it would damage any political agenda for raising useless and harmful taxes on the public which is designed to support a fraudulent myth.<br>  Well.........you decide which it is!|`|fwnqB0dTaa	WHAT<br>  <br>  It may show that 1998 was the warmest year on record, but it won't show that temperatures haven't changed.|`|zince8g1aa	Not seeing it...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.lrg.gif" rel="nofollow">http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...</a><br>  <br>  Statisticians would disagree with your assertion.
KTNqah9eaa	The cost of the new installation compared to the old? If that's what you want to know the best thing is to subtract the cost of the more expensive installation from the cost of the cheaper one and you'll have your answer.
