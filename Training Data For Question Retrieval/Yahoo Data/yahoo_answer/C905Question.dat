20090304091327AAEzoWw	Business & Finance;Investing	Question about when stock falls below its purchased price?	I have a question about holding stock within a brokerage that does not have a margin account. If I buy 10 shares of XYZ stock at $5 for a total of $50, and a few days later it falls to $3 per share for a total of $30 dollars do I then owe the brokerage company $20 dollars? If someone could clarify this I'd really appreciate it. I guess I'm under the impression that the account kind of works as a bank account in that when you overdraft you need to pay back the amount that you overdrafted.

I had a "no call no show" (Obviously i didn't care for the job)  Although it's grounds for immediate termination they took it as "willful termination" i.e. I quit.  What i want to know is if they can change the rate of pay from $8.00 an hour back to the state minimum on the money/hours they haven't yet paid me for?  I live in Ohio and at the very least i would like to know who i can contact either to find out if it's legal or to make a complaint against the company.

20090304091848AAiB5mH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	Are you ashamed to admit you are delighted with the financial collapse?	Perhaps you are living on a fixed income.  This economic collapse has only  helped you as prices fall on everything from a gallon of gasoline to a value meal at your favorite fast food restaurant.  Prices of commodities have fallen, stocks have fallen, you now have more buying power than you did before the collapse.  Maybe the collapse was the best thing that could happen to you financially.  Now with your puny little check you receive each month, your money will go farther than it would have gone just a few months ago.  That should be reason to celebrate.      Are poor people happy to see the rich losing their money?

20090304091728AAE1K62	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Moved out between tenancy agreements, am I responsible for rent?	I had been renting in a house share for about 6 months. In November the lease of the house expired, and as the letting agency did nothing to renew it, the landlord decided to leave them and rent it privately.       The landlord then sent a new tenancy agreement to the house to be signed. During this time I moved out and never signed the new agreement.      However, because a new tenant has not been found to fill my place in the house, the landlord is saying I am responsible for paying the next months rent.       Am I responsible?       Thanks

We provide emergency medical care to the poor, free of charge - have emergency medical care costs declined?

20090304055606AAWYTda	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Government & Non-Profit	Should I change jobs?	I currently work as an administrative assistant for a Big 10 university (for about a year and a half), but I recently interviewed for an administartive profession position at a small business that produces and sells educational videos and materials.        The new job would pay quite a bit more (about $600 per month more after taxes), but offers about half of the amount of Paid Time Off as my current job.  At my current job, I work 40 hours per week, but the new job would be salaried and could require longer hours.      Of course, my biggest concern is the effect of the economy on small businesses these days.  My job at the university is completely secure and totally decent, so it is a scary prospect to leave to work for a small business.  Also, my husband is about to get his degree, so we could be moving in about a year.  Would it look bad to be at one job for only 1.5 years, change to another job for a year (or less) and then move out of state?      What should I do?

This is just a survey to see how many people out there can save and how much are people able to have sitting in an account like the economy is today.  By all means, none of us can GET your money, so it shouldn' t hurt for you to be honest and tell how much you have stashed away.  Right?  Myself, I have five bucks in my savings.  I wouldn't have that if the bank wouldn't require that five must remain in the account at all times in order for the account to stay open.  So, how about you?

20090304080016AAzlO9c	Business & Finance;Investing	HELP NEEDED - Investing - Need security.  Is my money safer in the US or another country?	I have over $20, 000 that I am investing in a CD at a major US bank (Bank of America @ 2.50%- 9 month CD "no risk/early withdrawal penalties").  Although my $ is "supposedly" FDIC insured I do not want to lose a dime.  With all the uncertainty that is going on would it be wise to move my $ (convert it) to overseas currency until things turn around?  MANY are talking about the US economy crashing like the great depression and the talk out of Washington is very alarmist (doesn't inspire confidence on Wall Street- Jim Kramer and Buffet also think we are in BIG trouble).  I am personally not sure about this bailout helping- at all.  Even if FDIC insured, my $ will be worth little if the value of the US $ drops substantially which is looking more and more like a possibility.  WHAT COUNTRY WOULD YOU SUGGEST I put my $ into and how (what financial instrument) do you recommend- I want safety and sure, a little interest if possible but security of my hard earned $ first and foremost.  If not a foreign country I was considering buying real estate on the cheap with the thought that in 5+ years it could rebound substantially- wish the tax credit stayed at a max of 15k- I think they dropped it to 10k.

20090304080931AARx9Kx	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Should I quit or get a lawyer?	Late last summer, I was working with a fill-in pharmacist, and I was doing data entry on an RX that went through the final check and was given to the customer.  Monday, my boss came to me and said that I was under a 5 day suspension, and I was being wrote up and termination was possible.  I started in the pharmacy 2 weeks before the incident, and technically, I was not supposed to be working alone, since I was still undergoing on-the-job training.  I am state certified now.  In my state, you do not have to be certified to work in the pharmacy, except in hospitals.  The medication that I pulled was incorrect and the pharmacist did NOT catch it.  He does not check things, and since I have been working there, we (there are two other techs besides me) have continually had to pull things and tell the customers that they had to take their RX's to another pharmacy or we had to order their drug for the next day to keep him from making mistakes.  This medication mix-up has been re-filled 8 times and the pharmacists have NEVER caught it, the customer caught it when he went to the DR.  Thankfully, it was not a harmful mistake (I mean life or death) but he did suffer some side effects and his blood pressure has not been under control all this time.  I feel so horrible about it because I had done the processing.  However, the company did NOT suspend the pharmacist, report him to the state or anything.  I do not feel that this is fair.  I will take my wright-up, suspension because I think I do deserve it, but, It really angers me that the pharmacist who is SUPPOSED to check each and every RX for mistakes and ensure that they do not go out doesn't even get a slap on the wrist!  Worse, this pharmacist smirked at me and said that I need to watch what I am doing!  A few other pharmacists from different stores have told me that I will most likely be fired and that I need to get a lawyer right away, especially since I am state-certified and that I will not be able to get a job in another pharmacy because of this mistake, even though the store manager knew that I was not to be left alone since my training was not complete.

If the stock I'm interested in is at about 90.00, does that mean I pay $90 for one single share of it?       On a side note, I have a corporate job and also a part-time fun job, so the poor economy is not really affecting me fiscally. If I have disposible income, is now a good time to invest?? Or is this the worst time to invest?

20090304075417AAhrWSy	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How do we get our earnest money back on a house that fails the inspection?	On February 14th, we put down our earnest money on a house ($500). February 15th, we had the house inspected. The house is absolutely beautiful on the inside, but the inspection report came back that the house failed pretty much every major category. It has foundation problems (minimum 13 cracks), needs a new A/C (the old one is from 1992), needs insulation (it has none), needs proper ventilation (in some areas, the vents are covered in paint and all of the vents in the attic are not sealed), needs to have grounded wiring with GFCI outlets and to remove the aluminum wiring, and a few other problems.       We assumed the seller would not want to fix all of these problems, but (after three weeks and our ultimatum), he has come back with the estimate for the foundation repair. The foundation will cost $8,000 to fix--but that's going the cheaper route and we most definitely want the more expensive, better quality foundation repair. The seller has offered to fix the foundation and will either repair the other problems, which he has yet to give us the estimates on, or deduct that money off of the selling price.       After some debate, we have come to the conclusion that the seller will not fix the repairs in the way that we want that meets our minimum requirements, and rather than dealing with a house that has a history of foundation problems in the future when we try to resell, we want to let go of the house and find another deal.       Our contract says that the deal is contingent on the seller fixing problems that are TBD in the inspection report, yet we feel that these problems will not be fixed to our satisfaction. We are preapproved for an FHA loan, but we don't know if they will still offer funding on a house that house foundation problems. How do we get out of our contract without losing our earnest money?

I had a full time job and had recently started a part time job. @ 2 weeks after starting my part time job of about 180 dollars a week I got fired from my full time job. I was ruled eligible for compensation for UI benefits from my primary employer but found that @ 150 dollars a week would be deducted from my claim due to the income I made at my part time work. I left my part time work because it was not logical to work there in this situation. I reported the income I made the week I worked there while unemployed and stated I was no longer there. This disqualified me from benefits due to voluntarily quitting a part time job that I had for 3 weeks, The case is under appeal but was denied on the first appeal.   Any ideas? The state is Ky.       It says you can work part time and collect benefits in the FAQ's does that mean you have to maintain that PT job to keep recieving benefits?

I was out of work for almost 5 months, which really put us behind, but we never missed a mortgage payment. Now I have a job, but we want out. Our condo fees have gone up and our condo is now worth almost $100,000 less than we paid for it. We'll never recoup what we bought for.       If we do a short sale and the bank sees that we now have two incomes, enough to pay the mortgage, will the say no? I know they will look at our bank statements and ask for a worksheet of our monthly expenses, etc, etc. But, is that the criteria for them working with you? That you have to have higher expense than income?       Currently we have no car payment, but one of our cars is on it's last leg. Should we go buy a new(er) car so that it brings our expenses up?       Lastly, if the bank does agree to a short sale, can they come after us for the balance of the mortgage?       Obviously, I've never done this before and I have LOTS of questions. Any guidance is appreciated.

20090227062510AArXCc8	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I keep my daughters on my Checking Account?	When my wife passed away 11 years ago, I added my oldest child, a 15 year old daughter to my checking account so someone could write a check if needed if I wasn't home at the time. I worked out of town.      When she grew up and left home, I then added my youngest child, again, a 15 year old daughter to the account for the same reason. They both remain on the account even though now, they are 21 and 25. There was one time when I was in the hospital for a week and I realized I should probably keep them on even though the original need had passed.      In addition, I was put on, and still am on the personal bank accounts of all three of children. They were all minors at the time the accounts were open and when they became of age, we never thought about changing it.      All of my children are honest, hard working people. Trust never was or is now the issue.      I just heard about a friend that had a judgement against him for a LOT of money. They seized all of his money from all of his accounts that they could and then went after every other account that his name was a member of. Even taking money from his In-Laws.      Is my family all liable for each other's legal judgments if one arose? Say, like a traffic accident where one of us was responsible and didn't have enough insurance. Could they seize funds from our entire family even though we all have our own homes and families now? The accounts are shared âIn Name ONLY.â No mixing of money and it is only for family convenience in the case of an emergency.      Any help would be greatly appreciated!      Sincerely Yours,       Slarti4      (Russ)

I live in Southern Ontario and I always see questions on here with people asking about buying homes under $100,000K which seems totally insane up here.

I have gone through several forms online where they want everyone's birthdate, height, weight, and lots of other personal information.  I'm hoping there is an easier way to find cheap insurance just in case something happens.

My grandparents do not work, and receive social security benefits. Not much though. Maybe a combined amount of 12,000 a year for both my grandma and my grandpa. And they live with me and my dad. So my dad provides more than half their support so he reported them as dependants on his taxes. But my grandparents received a paper stating how much they earned during the year for SSI. So do they have to do their own taxes? Or was my dad supposed to put that income on his taxes? We're confused. help please.

She was planning to quit her job after bonuses were issued.  Now she finds out the amount was twice what it should have been.  Turns out the same thing happened to some of her peers in the company.  Chances are that this is a mistake (the company is full of idiots, hence her exasperation and impending departure).      Anyway, what can happen in this case?  Can the company ask for the money back?  Does their room for recourse change if she leaves the company?      I've told her to write an email to her boss saying, "Thank you for the very generous bonus - it was more than I expected"  and leave it at that.      Obviously, we're not spending the money until it's all sorted out.

I posted my concerns about the tenants smoking pot in my basement apartment before and a lot of wonderful people gave me good advice. Now with the tenants gone I'd like to share my experiences.   Rented my basement apartment,The tenants pay 1st month's rent no last months rent. Smoking in the basement starts immediately. Polite mentions of no smoking agreement. Stopped for a day or to. Heavy smoke in the house on Valentine's day. Notice to leave (verbal & written). No payment of last month's rent till then. End of the month comes and goes, no signs or mention of moving. Call them on phone but the girl is screaming and goes on about tenancy rights. Guy agrees to leave the following weekend and signs the agreement. No rent agreed for the 7 days.We want to get rid of them. We came to know later That they had leased an apartment but continued to stay on just to prove their tenancy rights. Over that they were using our laundry for the whole day before they left and when I locked it the next day the female had the nerve to scream at me that I was not allowed to do so.       Well the police was called to the scene and thankfully they agreed to move the next day as she was known to the officer as a trouble creater. Good riddance but lessons learnt :    - never rent the rental unit in the house if you have the same entrance    - never rent, period.

20090304083958AADsNkj	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What's a fair offer on a house that's been on the market for nearly a year in a transitioning community?	There are a few homes in our community for sale between 65-72K. Quality homes that need minimal upgrading work.  Many comparable homes (single-detached) have been on the market 6-months or more because they are just very dated need TLC.        The prices are that low, not because there is something wrong with the homes, it's just the area 'died' years ago.  It's transitioning with new industries moving into the community finally.      Half doubles average 20-30K but I'm not interested in those.  I'm tired of paying 6000-7000K a year in rent, listening to my neighbors' every word and with all the first time homebuyer's incentives I'm encourage to consider buying.  What's a fair offer for homes that have honestly just sat on the market?  I'm told first time homebuyers shoot too low and lose the homes frequently.        I see less of an issue selling in the future should we choose to move, because of new industries moving into the neighborhood.  Expecting young professionals and families.  The community is mostly elderly people but there are not many detached singles in this community.  There's a lot to consider on it being a 'smart move' or not.  What else should I be thinking about?      We don't expect to move for 3-5 years, both have quality stable jobs, AGI ~90K.  Very low taxes, non-existent crime, good schools despite being a low-income region.        Feedback and ideas welcomed.

20090304093353AApXTur	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is it smart to refinance our mortgage(s)?	Our house value is around 300k (just one year ago it was 347k) We have a 5/1 interest only mortgage due for change in April 2011 - interest is 6.467% and balance 181k. Also, we have home equity loan with balance 81k and interest 5.99%. Monthly payments for both (including escrow for taxes and insurance) are $2800. I could possibly refinance getting 4.85%, 30 years fixed with 0.650 points, all fees  and closing will be around $4500 and I can combine both mortgages together for one payment. We would like sell our house in about 2 years from now maximum, maybe less providing real estate market better conditions . Do you think that we should go ahead with refinancing or not? All input greatly appreciated. Thank you.

It's currently in escrow. We will take the keys on April 1 st. I'm worried what other costs associated with this will be. I mean, I know about the mortgage, of course, (a 30 year 5.0% 20% down) no ARM or interest payment crap that got so many folks in trouble.       Anyway, we are moving from a  2 br 2 ba 1,000 SQ FT apartment to a 3 bd 2 ba 1,500 SQ FT home. Small front lawn and small back yard.       I still don't know about extra costs, I know I will be extra careful saving water because at our apartment it's free so is trash pick up. I'm pretty good at trying to save electricity because ever since moving I replaced all our bulbs with CFL's but what other costs are there with owning a home? I know about property taxes too. Any folks have any advise for us?

The interest rate is low if I am qualified, from what I understand. A friend of mine is currently paying off a computer of his own, that his parents got him for his birthday, and he's satisfied with the deal they've got going.      I have a job, and I'm currently not in school. I'm almost 20, so I doubt I had any credit to really show since I haven't gotten any loans, gotten a credit card or anything of the sort, but paying $16 a month is very easy for me, but how can I show them that it's easy? I'm currently paying off a TV from a shop in town, I've never missed a payment. I know that this won't be trouble for me, and even if I do pay extra in the long-run, it doesn't bother me because it's worth getting it quicker for me.      I need this computer for school in a few months, and I have a trip to Europe this summer I must cover which I can't exactly cancel now, so monthly payments is the only way for me to get this computer.

I am going to buy 300 cans for $828 (including tax).   Then i am going to sell each can for $3.20, this creates $960 (if all are sold).   Leaving me to be in profit of $132 per month.    I still go school and want to generate money. Please do not say carry on learning and you will soon be earning big money. And just answer the question would you start this small business if you are 16 years old?   I worked out that i only make 15% profit is that good?   There is no extra costs because i am going to buy straight from the distributor and leave the stock in my room and bring customers to my house to pick up the paint. So no extra cost like utility bills and storing cost are needed.   The market is pretty good because our local graffiti store has closed and many graffiti artist in my school are looking for paint.   And this purchase is not against the law because you have to be 16 years old or above to purchase spray cans.   I have realized that the opportunity cost of this is giving up some of my leisure, lunch and break time.   Please advice.

Can anyone tell me more about that process?  Do landlords like to do it?  IS their a way to approach him about this that makes it beneficial for him? If you do that option to buy a home can the people buying the house then qualify for first time /low income homeowner repair programs.... or does the loan have to be carried by a bank.

I apologize for posting a question that I have seen many times on here however I wanted to get some clarification.      How much would you recommend spending monthly on a house. I've heard 25% to 33% but is that only on your Mortgage (principle and interest) or is that PITA (principle, interest, taxes, and association). Also is this a percentage of your pre-tax income or take home income?      Currently my fiance and I are in the market for a house in Central Florida, with just principle and interest it is 26% of our take home income. With PITA it is 33%. I am very cautious at this point as I am a first time home buyer and don't want to become house poor.
