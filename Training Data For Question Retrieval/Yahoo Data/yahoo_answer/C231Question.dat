20070716120459AAbAAmy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	For parents or near future parents only...?	A  young girl asked why her brother  had permission to do everything and hang out with girls, when her father would not let her out with her guy best friend. This double standard is something I find regrettable, because fathers would not feel they have to protect their young girls if they taught their son the same exact thing they teach to their girls. Parents, do you teach your boys to respect girls, do you teach them to be careful? Don't you think that by having this double standard in your home you are teaching something very specific to your children ... like "go ahead boy it's her job to protect herself"... "girl, boys don't have any responsibility with sexuality, get use to the fact that men will always be horndogs"??? I have a son, and he's approaching teenage years, I have always taught him that boys and girls are equal in every way. If I had a daughter they would have the same rules. If I'm over protective with her I will be with him.      Your imputs are apreciated

I cook (breakfast, lunch & dinner), clean the entire house (daily), sweep, mop, take care of the kids, run all of the errands, deal with dr appts, do the grocery shopping, cook dinner, do laundry, put it ALL away, feed the kids, bathe them, read them a story, tuck them in, and clean the kitchen, and THEN eat my dinner (when it's nice and cold) at like 9:00 at night before relaxing for about 20 minutes to unwind & then go to sleep.  Just to be woken up all night by our 6month old son.  Then get up at 7-8:00 the next morning just to do it all over again.  It's a daily routine.  That's not including the secretary work I do from home (daily!) for my grandmother who is a sales rep, home school my sister (who is 13), and trying to start my own business (which I get NO time to work on, so i have NO idea how I am EVER going to start it)...oh yeah, and random other things I do (errands for others, office work for others, & cleaning bathrooms & homes for others) just to make extra $$.  But NONE of that counts to ANYBODY.  Everybody seems to think that because I don't physically got to a job, that none of it counts.  That I sit around all day and do NOTHING.  Just watch TV.  I am so sick, and frustrated.  It makes me want to just go to a regular job.  But then I would lose the experience & opportunity to raise my own children.

I just found out today by my mum that my sister 19 has had an abortion.At first when my mum told me i was upset and kind of confused as to why she felt she couldn't tell me.She didn't want my mum to find out either but she accidentally came across her paperwork.Whats upset me even more is that i asked my mum not to go straight back to her and say that shes told me as i wanted to hear it from her so i can support her and talk to her and let her open up to me,but mum went straight to her and told her i knew and now ive got to somehow not mention it again apparently.Im 5 years older then my sister and we are close and this is why its upset me so much.my sister doesn't want to talk about it and its so hard as all i want to do is talk to her.I know i have to respect her wishes but if my mum hadn't  gone back to her and told her that i knew,it may of given my sister the opportunity to confide in me.Im just worried that shes suffering in silence and i don't know what to do for the best:-?

20090128143916AAO2QdK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Heartbroken - and feel like the worst mother in the world?	Today is my almost 6 m.o daughters first day of day care.  I left her with her carer to go inside just to get her hat - and she threw a fit, almost to the point of hysteria.  When I finally left for good, I left her crying - I feel completely awful.      She has started daycare because I need to do my online University studies, at first I really didn't want to put her in, but as the wise Violated Meppa once told me 'Put things in perspective. Milestones are important, but so is her future.'      My question is, how did you feel when your baby went in to childcare for the first time? Was their reaction like Alissa's?      Should I go and pick her up?! I miss her and can't concentrate!   Thanks

I am pretty sure I am prego and dreading to tell her so much I don't even want to talk to her. What do u think I should do, is this a normal instinct that she isn't happy for me?

20081019082753AAVSMYW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does my 4 year old daughter possibly have ADD.?	I am starting to think that maybe my 4 year old has some attention problems. She is constantly talking, singing, yelling, there is just constant noise out of her mouth. I have also noticed at her swim lessons and such that she does have a hard time waiting for her turn. Additionally, she wakes up fairly early for school and she does not tire. She does not rest at nap time and the teacher often has to find something for her to do while the class rests. Even at night when I read to her she is still bouncing around like its first thing in the morning. She is just always going, going, going.    As far as school is concerned the teacher really has not mentioned any problems with her. She gets along well with other children and is not disruptive. She has had 2 incidents at nap time butt the teacher really did not seem to concerned over it.    She is my only child and I have no one to compare her to but she is a ball of energy and sometimes I feel like her lack of concentration is hurting her. Any comments would be appreciated.

My daughter is just over 3 months old.  If I go by the old book, I get 30 pts per day.  Before I was nursing I was allowed 20-22pts per day. I'm not a big milk producer.  This is my second child, and I just don't get a lot of milk in. I pump 2 times during the day at work and if I'm lucky I end up with 6-7 oz total.  (I get about 1.5-2 oz from each side).  I supplement with formula. Since I don't product a ton of milk, do I still need the 30 points or should I go with a lower number?      Also, if anyone knows of any good ab exercises designed specifically for post-natal bodies my flabby abs could definitely use them!   Thanks!

This period I was only two days late, but it was very very light compared to normal. It only lasted about three and a half days compared to the normal 5 or 6. After my light period, I am not having a brown discharge. It doesn't really look like old blood, but maybe possibly  is. In my period I had to small  blood clots so I thought I could be having a miscarriage, but beside the small blood  clots have had no symptoms of one. I have had very minor cramps, head aches, upset stomach some, and a feeling of being very full. I have took two pregnancy tests and both were negative. They were the ones that are supposed to tell you 5 days before your missed period if that matters. Any thoughts of pregnant or miscarriage or neither and its in my head!?!      I do have unprotected sex with my fiance regularly so I can't really give dates on how far along I would be.

She is a beautiful 1 year old and she is a happy baby. We do all the normal things together but I can't bond with her. The problem is getting worse, and I don't have the heart to put her up for adoption but what else can I do? I'm 17 and having her in my life is literally killing me.

No, I'm not irrational; I'm just looking for alternative options. In advance, thanks for taking the time.

20090128150207AA8071m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I pregnant? Or is something wrong?	At the beginning of this month *January* I had my period. On the 17th, i had sex with my boyfriend and shortly after began feeling..wierd for lack of a better word. I have been very tired, moody, and nauseous. On top of all this, 2 days ago (which would be about 9 days after I had sex) I started bleeding slightly. It was only a little bit of blood which was pink and brown. I had no cramps or discomfort that normally come with my period, and I have already had my period for this month. I bled a little for two days and today it slowed down and then stopped. I wondered if this was implantation bleeding but yesterday when I took a test it came back negative. I am going to wait until next month and take a test again but I am wondering if anyone has an opinion on this. Waiting is killing me. In my mind, I am almost 80 percent sure I am pregnant. I can't explain why...I just kind of know. I feel different in a lot of ways. Am I pregnant, or is something else going on?

Then i asked my dad, why i cant i stay out late, and he says im a good kid that i cant stay out late. And he says when he's feeling down he thinks of me because im soo good.    Sorry, if this is alot, i just want to have more freedom, because my parents expect me to be boring like them.      Any suggestion, no rude comments or answers. :)

20090128175745AAn1Srs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why Has My Mind Changed?	I'm fourteen years old, and up until about two months ago, I hated - HATED the thought of having kids. I swore on my life that if I ever got pregnant, I would get an abortion, no questions asked.      About four months ago I started dating the most amazing guy in the world. I'm serious. He's fifteen, really funny, nice, smart, athletic, and can guess whatever I'm thinking. I have no idea why he stays with me, seeing as I'm a big pain in the *** at times. Anyway, back to the subject at hand...      So around two months ago, I started thinking it might not be so bad to have one kid. Seconds later I thought, 'Why the hell would I want kids?!?! What's wrong with me?!?!'       Of course I don't want one - it would pretty much ruin my chances of becoming an actor, singer, and film director. But every so often I catch myself thinking about if I got pregnant (I am still a virgin), would I keep it?      Why has my mind changed?? I really love this guy, but loving someone who is the most important person in your life doesn't make you want kids!
20090128175106AA2WgtG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it wrong to feel sorta racist as a teen?	Yes, I know racism is stupid and ignorant, but it's a natural feeling I get everytime I see some hispanics. My family is Hispanic, I'm american born. The thing is, the main reason my area is being ruined is usually the cause of hispanics. 99% of the time. They have wannabe gangs here, that try to fight people, talk **** in spanish, steal, and do grafitti. Years ago, this use to be a nice place. Sure, there was hispanics, just not as much. But as years passed, illegal families started moving in with dumb wannabe gangster kids that have been tagging up my beautiful neighborhood, popping my mom's tire, and scratching my dad's porsche. Recently, I lost my phone (my fault) and I called it like 5 times, and by the 5th time these hispanics (Mexicans because they said "guey") answered and they didn't talk, they just said Hello? And started talking in their slang to their friends. Then they hung up. I was asking for my phone back. I'm getting it suspended ASAP. It's stupid, and I feel sorta stupid feeling this way, but I swear, 99% of the problems here are caused by hispanics and they are degrading my area. There are other gangs of other races that do not cause much trouble, they just skate and smoke weed. But these guys cross the line.      Don't get me wrong, I do have hispanic friends that I love and I'd sacrifice a lot for, but when I see these people that are sagging, lazy, and talking slang, I can't help but get mad. I know not all of them are like this, and there's bad people in every race.      My questions are: Is it wrong to feel sorta racist as a teen (as listed on the heading), Have you ever felt this way as a young teen? Why?       No BS answers please. And if you're hispanic, I'm sorry if I offended you.

I started a high powered antibiotic today and was wondering how long it's going to take to start feeling better? I'm drinking plenty of a water and cranberry juice and sitting on my butt.       I swear this hurts worse than labor and the kidney stone I had a few years back COMBINED. All I can do is sit back and cry and  let the Tylenol take the edge off it. I feel like I'm dying I swear! :(        I was showing all the symptoms of having a UTI for the past 4 days but I didn't realize it. It wasn't until I woke up with a fever of 102 this morning and was doubled over in pain that I went to get checked out and realized it was a UTI. I'm almost 38 weeks pregnant so I thought a lot of my symptoms were just from the being pregnant (peeing more often, pelvic pressure/pain, pain in my abdomen ect.) mixed with being what I thought was a flu like bug.      I can barely type right now I'm in soo much pain but I need to do something to keep my mind off it. If you have any experience with a UTI while please tell me. I need to know there is light at the end of this stupid tunnel. Are my antibiotics going to start working soon or am I going to feel like this for the next few days?      Sorry for being such a big baby. Maybe it's just cause I'm soo pregnant but it makes me feel better to type all this till my hubby can get back to our house with more cranberry juice and bottled water. :(

So i pulled out the pregnancy test cause i knew i had to pee right then...i took the test and it pop up negative i didn't give it three minutes i just threw it in the garbage...then my husband went in the bathroom and look in the garbage and it said i was pregnant. So am i or not. Could the result be wrong cause i drunk alot of fluids before and took it and could it be wrong cause it wasn't on a flat surface? I need help. It was a Equate Pregnancy Test from Walmart. Then i took another test from Dollar General Store it was called a One Step Pregnancy Test. I came up with a very very faint line in the middle of the cross. It says that i am pregnant even if fait. So am i? The i took the dollar store test another kind and it was only a dollar. The woman said she took it and it work for her. I took it awhile ago and it said i wasn't pregnant. I bought another to test in the morning. So am i pregnant or am i not? Could i be doin the test wrong and not getting accurate results. I hope i am i just don't want to get my feelings hurt. People tell me drinking alot of fluids gives negative results. And do you go by results after ten minutes? Why would two test say maybe pregnant and the other said i wasn't pregnant?

20090128174541AAC8Gws	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is It Weird For A Girl To Ask A Guy Out?	This question is just for the heck of it.I Just wanna hear some answers i'm not like like desperate to hear what you say.(:      Thanxxx For Hoo-EvUrr Answers!<33
20090128173210AAfnmwq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Headache, what would you do, 28.5weeks pregnant.?	I've had a headache basically sense Friday. I'd take some Tylenol(1000mg for my weight okayed by my OB) and it wouldn't' work so 6hrs later I'd take a Tylenol  3 prescribed by my OB, that would work but I'd wake up the next day with the headache back.    Its a weird headache, its not the throbbing, I can't move kind, its a constant pain above my eyes kind.    It was somewhat gone on Monday, not really noticeable. I have't taken anything for it sense Saturday because I'm out of Tylenol and I really dont feel safe taking the T3's.    Some more info. When I was pregnant with my son my bp would go between xxx/80's up to 151/110, along with a headache, but they never said it was anything, and just chalked it to Pregnancy induced Hyptertension.  At my OB's appt last week my BP was 120/80 (2weeks before it was 104/64), at the ENT appt I went to this Monday it was at 130/92, then yesterday when I was seeing the Endocrinologist for my Gestational Diabetes it was 138/94. The Endo rechecked it before I left and said it was 126/76 but my son was messing with her, and the little bulb that up push to put air into the cuff so I dont know how accurate that is.

I cannot help feeling that I took it too early and that it was a mistake. Should I take another one or is it all in my head? I need advice please and would be appreciated thanks!

20090128175608AAsOWCR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Ok parents, how do you know when your child is lying?  ?	I'm primarily focusing on the 10 to 15 year age group, more so girls than boys.  I'll take any advice on the subject though.       I tend to be a very empathetic person and I think I'm being taken advantage of by my 13 year old daughter.  One of the problems, she's sick and can't go to school, this is happening a lot....so, what do you do as a parent if you're not sure they're sick enough to stay home?   Also, what can a parent do about figuring out whether you're being lied to about other things.   Thanks!!

20090128171149AA1gNHx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has any one else been through this... I need help and comfort?	My son was born in Sep. 18 2008, I was induced 2 weeks early because my son was not growing due to IUGR. (Intro Uterine Growth Retardation). He is normal except for the fact that he has a head deformity. At first they weren't worried about it and now suddenly at his 4 month check up, she tells me that it needs to be cat scanned and he needs physical therapy to help correct it.    So his Cat Scan is scheduled for tomorrow and they have to sedate him and give him an IV.     Im so worried and stressed, every time I look at him I just feel sad. I seem more annoyed and easier, I am so scared that they are going to tell me something is wrong with my baby.    I will love him all the same, but its still so scary.     I just need to know if anyone else has gone through this and what I should expect. Also some comfort and reassurance wouldn't hurt.     Thanks

20090128175554AASZExe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My Mom doesn't care about me or love me or trust me...?	Last year, I got raped and I told my mom and she said I made it up to cover up sleeping around, but then, I started skipping school because I was depressed, and I ended up staying in a treatment centre for depression for two weeks and I went back to school part time (and I was attending all of them) but then my depression didn't get any better. And basically I ended up having to steal some money from my sister so I could buy necessities, like food and stuff for school cause my mom said she didn't want to waste her money on me. And then even though I haven't stole since then she uses that against me and claims she doesn't trust me. And today she was supposed to come with me to school to register me and she didn't. And she was also supposed to take me to the dermatologist since my skin has been really painful lately (I think it's stress) and she didn't. And she said she had better things to do. And when I told her I might be depressed still she said I was just lazy and well, basically, she said she's just given up on me ever being normal. And so I told her I was gonna call my dad (my parents are divorced and he lives 9 hours away) to see if I could come live with him, but she then she took all the phones and my cellphone and hid them, and she said I wasn't allowed to. And now I just feel trapped and stuff and helpless and my dad even said I could call him if things got bad and he'd come and get me, and she won't even let me. What should I do?

How can I convince my moms friend to let her go to this sort of expensive camp (even though her godmother can pay for half of it, so money won't be the biggest issue)?      Her mom is really worried about the safety. I explained this all to my friend, gave her a link, answered her questions and everything. I told her about other people I have met who did it and LOVED it.   She talked to her mom briefly, and her mom laughed.   Then my friend told her a little more,   but she still wasn't convinced.   Then she had to go (we were talking through IM). And then she said she would show her mom the site and everything later that night.   And if she had questions to call me.   Otherwise, she would fly to L.A. to her godmothers for a cheaper flight to Honolulu. This would be like a gift from her godmother who is like a 2nd mom to her.   Anyway, she really needs help. I am sort of asking this for my friend.      But one problem, is that her mother is REALLY REALLY overprotective!! Like she wouldn't let my friend do this one thingie at school because she didn't want her daughter to get hurt.   Well this is a WHOLE different thing. This trip is to Hawaii!!!! And it's totally safe and stuff, ect.    here's the link to help:    http://www.adventurescrosscountry.com/    I'm taking the younger trip, Hawaii discovery. Just 'cause its my first year, not my age. I would just perfer too.      So any good advice?   THANKS SO MUCH!!

I usually give her a full bath but let's say I just did and she poos, she gets a rinse. I just think it's cleaner and more hygenic, especially for a little girl. My mom says I'm OCD about it. Geez.
20090128213505AAHjgR2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Getting pregnant, as a TEEN?	This is something very important to me, I think about it a whole lot, every time I see a baby, babysit, hold a baby, touch a baby, and more. So before you answer to what I'm going to ask just know if you're only going to criticize PLEASE DON'T ANSWER. Nobody knows because it's too personal and writing it in a journal didn't seem to help. I feel like somebody should know so I could get advice. So since nobody here knows me I thought I could open up here.      I'm 13 years old. Yes 13. Very simply I WANT A BABY. I think they're adorable, beautiful, cute, amazing, angels. I know they don't stay that way forever and grow up, get personalities, etc, etc. I also know they cost money, need care, need an education, need a home, and much much more. I know pregnancy also takes a toll on your body.      I want a baby. I want a baby with all my heart. I know I am way too young and you need sex to conceive a baby. No man/boy as far as I know would EVER want to be a father usually during teen years. I also know it's very unlikely to find true love as a teenager also someone who would support my choice for unprotected sex.      I'm too young now but my lifelong dream is to have a child. I want a child as a teenager. I don't know why I just DO. It seems really retarded and weird I know. But I think of names I could name my child, things I want them to see and do, toys I want to buy them. I pass the baby isles in the stores and see the clothes, bottles, bibs, itsie bitsie shoes, and the adorable strollers, etc.      If I wasn't so young and it was possible I'd try to get pregnant right now. I'm really hoping to wait until I'm around 16-17 to have a baby. If possible 18 so I'll be legal really. But I probably will be 16 if not 15! I know this sounds crazy but I want a baby.      I'll work my butt off until I'm 16 to get the money to pay for childcare, clothes, food, furniture, etc. I will spend 3 years of hard work and chores to earn the money. I'll sell so much of my stuff and just work, work, work!!!       My questions:      Risks of having a baby as a teenager (for the baby, ex: deformed etc.) ?   Am I sane and normal to want a baby?   Any thing else you'd like to say, advice, anything except criticizem?

I've been having some serious cramping all throughout my abdominal region (some pain in my lower back, right above my hips and majority of it is up above where my uterus is expanded to and all around the belly). It's been going on for a few hours and laying down with minimal movement helps. It feels worse than round ligament but there's no contracting feeling, it's constant. I don't have any discharge going on and the baby is still moving and kicking like it normally would.       Basically what i'm asking is if other women had gone through these same symptoms before would please share their experience.      **Note: I'm not looking for people to tell me I could be having a miscarriage and I should go to the hospital.**

20090128192411AAdMJiR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I get an abortion ? ?	Hi everyone,    This is very hard for me to do as I am a very private person, but i'm confused and sad and I need help from people that don't know me.    I am a 24 year old woman, I just found out I am pregnant (about 5 or 6 weeks).    When I told my boyfriend (in his 30's)  he told me it was my decision and would support me no matter what, he then told me he was 50/50 on it and it was up to me.    We've been together for close to a year now, he is amazing and I have no doubt he would be a great father.    A few days after out conversation, my heart was set on keeping the baby, when we were talking, before I had a chance to tell him, he told me he was leaning more towards an abortion, which broke my heart. Normally, I would tell any pregnant woman "it's your choice" but our situation is quite complicated.    To start, I am in debt, I mean, large amount of debt. Although I am doing all I can to reduce it, it's still quite high.    Issue number 2: My boyfriend and I live quite far from each other, close to 5 hour drive.    His reasoning behind us choosing to get an abortion is my debt, our distance situation and the fact that he wanted to spend more time with me, him and I together, before having a baby.    I know some of you may say "well move close to him or him close to you" but it's not that easy, right now our careers are not permitting us to move. If I quit my job to move away, it will be hard on only one salary, an who would hire a pregnant woman ... ??    I tell myself everything will come together, and I know that if I tell him I want to keep the baby he will support me, but I also know deep down he will regret it, and I'm afraid of ruining his life or him one day feeling like I forced him into something he was not ready to do and resent me. I can't find it in me to tell him !    Any advise ?

We went to the doctor and on Monday the 26th the doctor said that she was 22 weeks and three days along which would make her 22 weeks and five days at the time of this question. If that estimate were correct that would put the time of conception at August 22nd give or take a few days of course. The actual time of conception was on or up to five days after the 12th of September which would put the doctors 9 month estimate at least three weeks off and possibly a few days more. My question is: is it normal for doctors to be off by that much time and I know that she was with another man at that time by her own admittance. Could it be his child? Please help.

20090225154318AA6mEQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I am 1 day late and getting BFNs!?	I am currently ttc #2. I just got off of the mini pill at the end of January. I did not have any of my normal "O" symptoms so I am not certain that I ovulated this cycle. I conceived my first child on the first cycle but this time I am late and getting BFNs. I got a BFP at 2 days late with my first baby. I have absolutely NO symptoms of either AF or PG. When should I be concerned about AF not showing. I HATE seeing BFNs and I am very confused because normally I can track my fertility symptoms/signs and I am not getting anything this time at all.

Even if she was a vegan and was incredibly athletic like playing on the track & field and swimming & diving teams, and being the captain of the dance troupe, so there were justifiable reasons for her being thin?

20090225154434AA1nwd3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	LABBBOORR!!! HELP plz?	= )   I'm getting induced tonight due to complications. I go in at 7pm.   I had a regular check up this morning to see what induction method she was going to use. I'm still 3cm and 60% effaced but she still wants to use the gel, before pitocin because I have a placenta problem.      BUT Just an hour ago I noticed lots clear snot with quite a bit of blood in it. I was wondering where it was coming from. I put another piece of toilet paper on my vagina opening and it is coming from there. It's every time I wipe, or touch that area.       Is this my bloody show? I thought I had that a week or two ago and I didn't. I only had spotting once, this time it's every time I wipe. It's driving me nuts as to what it is.      I'm getting induced in a couple of hours anyway but I was just wondering if I'm having my bloody show or if it's from the exam this morning.         What was your bloody show like? Every time you wiped? How much?

20090225154653AATqrRw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I am 14 and have trouble making friends?	I have friend that hang out with only at school. But I just dont feel comfortable with them either. I mean I dont believe in what they think is cool. For example, they all are obessed with the life of celebrites, movies wherein I dont really care of them, I mean I dont care who is pretty, who is hot or ugly... They think I read boring books, which is classic.We all read books. But I just have trouble making friends, even though I hang out with  them I find myself lonely. But things are worse, I get along with adult or girls who are older than me very fine. I dont have any trouble making friend with an person older than my age. Which is wierd. I dont even drink or have bf but I get along with boys fine too. The only friend I can trust is a boy of 15 and he is now in England, far from me now. I miss him very much too. I am just a normal teenager struggling to cope up with other teens and this world. I just hate being so different than other peole my age, I am old-fashioned in some way I guess. But I dont want to change myself either just make friends.No offence to others but  I am not that sort of girl, who loves doing jokes or pranks, or girl who is a nerd like,or a girl who is 'cool'   Please gave me some advice on making friends with people my age with out changing who I am.   But dont you think I am wierd

20090225154722AAjfQF0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Is this normal 10 year old behavior.?	I'm starting to think that my 10 year old cousin is warped. He is American and I am from Europe so often my parents will brush his horrible behaviour  off as a cultural difference.  I will give some examples and would like you to tell me if I'm overreacting? All little boys in the states cannot be so horrible! Just to note , he is pretty smart he skipped fourth grade and is now in fifth.       Examples:   The other day him and my younger cousin were talking about how Rhianna got bet up by Chris brown. He said that he thought Chris brown was cool for doing that and that Rhianna was stupid for letting him.      He is constantly hitting and bossing other children.      Him and his brother  8 beat the crap out of each other all the time and they never ever cry.      When my 13 year old cousin told him to stop hitting his younger cousins he said "who are you to tell me what to do" and started hitting her.      He uses the word retard a lot (hate that word)      He has no manners and never even says hello to anyone.      He cannot bear to be criticised.

I usually have some half-caf coffee and I don't drink that much of it.  But I'm starting to think that it is affecting my baby!  He moves around ALL the time...I think he's hyper from coffee!  Is this possible??  (I'm 26 weeks)
