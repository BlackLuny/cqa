AA12279950	Definitely.  I'm a foster carer and only too aware of some of the horrors that go on out there.<br>  <br>  Andrew C - if we all took the 'wait and see' attitude, where would that get us?  If there's nothing to worry about it will all end well regardless of whether someone has reported suspected neglect or not.  If we all keep quiet until we're absolutely certain, the child in question could suffer even more.  If there's any suspicion of abuse/neglect - it's our duty to inform the authorities asap.|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	The simple answer is yes, but there may be circumstances when you'd hesitate to get involved. For example, the child has bruises but the parents always have a good reason (he's clumsy), you hear the child next door crying miserably every night but the mum says he just doesn't want to go to sleep or has an upset stomach ... Or supposing it's a friend's child and you just can't believe they would hurt their own child, plus you don't want to lose a good friend -or it's your niece/nephew you think is being abused and how do you report your own brother for harming his baby? After all, he's been under a lot of stress since he lost his job ...<br>  <br>  These are not examples I actually know of, I am just playing devil's advocate here, but just trying to make the point that it isn't always black and white.<br>  <br>  Having said all that, I would definitely never want to be in the position of someone who has not made a report of suspected abuse and the child dies.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Yes, absolutely and well done you. If there's not a problem then at least your mind is put at rest but you could have also saved a child from cruelty.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	No I would leave it to suffer (sarc). Of course I would contact the authorities.|`|qBGcU465aa	I have already done so and told the parents it was me who phoned social services|`|cdaedf9f007c1ba212c680132983233caa	Wouldn't even hesitate.|`|3fd13a299603b3f5d603e1a660b1d1ecaa	Of course I would, why the hell not!?|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	Yes I would, but I'd have to make damn certain there really was a problem first.|`|SYU4JIohaa	If I had a real, genuine reason for believing a child was being abused or neglected then yes I would inform someone, but I'd make sure I had something good enough to back up my claims.<br>  <br>  My sister was very clumsy as a child, and as a result had a few hospital visits and was always covered in cuts and bruises.  My Mum tried to keep her safe, but she was just an inquisitive child.  One day a social worker came to the door as they had received claims that my sister was being abused.<br>  <br>  My Mum was appalled, angry, embarrassed and more but she knew that whoever had made these claims did so in the best interests of her child so she couldn't stay angry for too long.<br>  <br>  I'd rather live with the guilt of being wrong, than of being right and not doing anything about it.|`|qIqUdEuPaa	definitely alert someone about what is happening to this child. Even if you think something worse might happen to them if you do, it would still be better to inform the authorities weather that be the police, family services etc. it will still help.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	Yes I would, I have no problem with informing on someone when it comes to the child's welfare. I have 3 children and can not imagine how anyone could ever do something bad to little people, who are dependant upon you for everything.|`|2yIs6eTUaa	I would make sure that the child ACTUALLY IS abused or neglected.<br>  <br>  Please answer my question: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahd.bWVpqOfyrrDvZauC_Gvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225021239AAwLc1T">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	I would want to be sure that my suspicions had some foundation before going to the authorities, but, yes, I would inform them if I knew a child was being abused and/or neglected.|`|3QtO3SpFaa	I would, and without giving it a second thought. I have 2 children and I cannot tolerate ANY abuse towards children. Period.|`|AA12398803	Yes and i would not give it a second thought as that child is suffering and i could not live with that on my conscience|`|HRoqmlKxaa	I do not understand the relevance of this question, who wouldnt???|`|CqifZwoLaa	Yes I would. Definitely no matter what the outcomes may be.|`|uKrdjrJiaa	Yes and i would pray i was wrong rather than right!|`|HFWLYMD6aa	if i had evidence. yes i might.|`|UP2WzIISaa	yes it is the right thing to do.|`|77DIXX4Aaa	yes yes yes yes yes|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Yes, if I had genuine reason to believe so.<br>  <br>  However, there have been incidences of trouble makers reporting people, particularly in this area just to put the wind up them.  It's a little pathetic, and a total waste of social services time, which could otherwise be spent breaking up families and neglecting genuinely abused kids!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Andrew C, quite right, an example someone else heard of children crying at night can be heard at most houses.  Most kids don't want to go to bed, doesn't mean they're being abused, I did it myself when I was a child, I could turn the waterworks on if it meant I could stay up and watch TV!  Let's not villanise good parents.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes of course|`|1G3XPiq3aa	It really depends. Often there isn't enough proof for social services to do anything. I used to look after a girl who's mother didn't feed her, and who used drugs with her bf, and who had no power in her house from not paying the electricity bill. After a few months of her having dinner at my house every night and being at my house from after school every day, my neighbour and I began to expect she was being abused as well when she started making sexually explicit comments to my neighbours young boy, so we called social services. Despite a lot of evidence she was being neglected, the situation was only "monitored" and because her mother knew it must've been me that called, the little girl wasn't allowed to come over anymore either, and was in that environment all the time. You have to think about how informing the authorities is going to effect that childs life in reality. Obviously when I called it was at a fairly extreme point, and I didn't think she wouldn't actually be removed from their care, so for anything less, you really need to be careful. <br>  <br>  Also, a ridiculous number of complaints are found to be completely unfounded. Something like 80%. You have no idea what investigations do to good parents and families who have done nothing wrong. <br>  <br>  So for those who said you wouldn't think twice, I suggest you not only think twice, but maybe three or four times. It might make you feel good to tell on someone else, but how is it going to effect that child in actuality.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	YES!<br>  <br>  I can answer from personal experience. I used to work in the private sector regarding child eduction. A member of staff pointed out their concerns to me regarding a 4 year old child. I observed the child for some days, took accounts from staff, and kept an indeapth account of all that had been seen, witnessed and the things that were of concern...<br>  <br>  When I reported this all to a colleague, social services were called in, the parents were interviewed and subsequently the child was placed into temporary foster care, now the child has been adopted into another loving family.<br>  <br>  The child had suffered, more than I can mention and the parents got what they deserved.<br>  <br>  This will never STOP unless people speak out, if you do and it is all innocent, then at least you can be relieved that you were wrong, however guilty you feel.<br>  That guilt is NOTHING compared to the guilt you feel, when a child your concerned about ends up dead because no one was willing to stand up and shout for help!!|`|EEpBrsSnaa	Yes i would do if I had some proof.  And without going into details, I have done.|`|pRoyFWL6aa	Slow down there! My seven year old is on the sofa watching t.v and napping.He was sick last night and sick this morning the school are aware.<br>        Now what if he's off school the rest of the week and i have a neighbour like yourself who THOUGHT that he was being abused/neglected because YOU had not seen him for a few days.Are you even aware what loving families have been through in this country because of people who THINK irresponsibly rather than factually. <br>                      By all means if you KNOW about something then do something otherwise tread very carefully.Edit. Away with the fairys ,i speak from experience,when one of my sons was diagnosed with autism we only had the support of our youngest's health visitor until my son with autism escaped my hand one day and ran into the road(no injuries thankfully)but did get a bump of a car.The social workers were round in a flash and spent a week prying on our parenting skills when we thought we were going to get practical advice on dealing with autism.Thanks to our health visitor at the time,lots of self teaching on autism from the internet my son no longer runs in the road ,trys to climb out of windows,posts my wallet or glasses through the letterbox etc etc and is progressing well.The social workers had no interest in my son ,just his parents.

Y4OatVl3aa	Sounds about right. Barrymore's lost it all and it's time for the father to move on. It's understandable that he's looking for someone to blame and was probably unaware his son was gay. It's just time to call it a day now and he needs to move on. Just because it happened at Barrymore's house doesn't mean he's responsible for the death. I have to ask myself would the father be pursuing this in the same way if it had happened at someone's house (non-famous) we'd never heard of. He has my sympathy but it's time to move on.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  ____<br>  Barrymore may well be a ridiculous creature and I'm certainly no fan of Barrymore, but that doesn't make him a murderer. Leave the poor guy alone for God's sake - what do you want from him, blood? Just leave it alone. [sighs]|`|fynzkVK4aa	I agree with you, I also think Michael Barrymore has suffered more than enough because of it.  There was never any real evidence of any "wrong doing", it seems to me like a lad had too much drink and drugs, fell in a pool off his face and drowned.<br>  <br>  A tragedy, but an accident.<br>  <br>  It could have happened anytime, anywhere, given what has been reported about Lubbock's lifestyle.  If Barrymore wasn't famous, I don't think half as much would have been made of the case to begin with, and I definitely don't think we would still be hearing about it now.<br>  <br>  I think it is about time the media laid this to rest, and let those affected by it try to move on.  It isn't doing anyone, including Lubbock's family, any good to keep trawling over it.|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	Nobody really knows what Stuart Lubbock's sexual orientation was. What is known is that he went to a 'party' at Micheal Barrymore's house and ended up dead with internal injuries, which reading between the lines were caused by gross anal penetration. Yesterday's report on the police investigation was pretty damning in that allowed the crime scene to be contaminated and failed to analyse blood on Lubbock's boxer shorts. Basically the police ******* up. Had the police investigation been carried out professionally and in a timely manner I am certain all of the facts would now be known. As no one has suggested that Lubbock inflicted these injuries upon himself, then someone at that party was resposible and why this line wasn't followed up is beyond me.|`|AA12279950	I'd love you to be right, as it would make a sorry situation slightly better but sadly I don't think you are.  The victim was almost certainly a closet homosexual and definitely an occasional drug user.  Unfortunately his injuries were quite horrific (according to media reports) and even 'some pretty sordid sex acts' wouldn't have inflicted them.  Therefore your theory is flawed.|`|3f21c30b3424532b28fd9578258f69d9aa	Its shocking that Stuart was a " Rent Boy " - but he shouldnt have been Fisted like a Turkey and left to die a painful death ...That freak Barrymore should be locked up... it sounds like Barrymore ran out the front door - passed the Cop's shouting " Allwwwight " ...and they let him flee the scene..|`|QmWO1Kfbaa	I think Barrymore played a part in this death and is a coward , he turned tail and ran . When he appeared on television he got his laughs from the contestants , taking the piss out of them .|`|jWTZfP4naa	my opinion is that it was a long time ago, and Barrymore's no criminal mastermind. if he was guilty, there would be sufficient evidence to prosecute.|`|xxQ5QEqOaa	I like Micheal Barrymore and i think he's innocent and should come back to entertain us again.|`|chpYJzInaa	I knew Stuart.<br>  <br>  I was woken very early by his girlfriend who sat in my house waiting for him to call as it was extremely unusual for him not to after being out. HE was NOT a closet homosexual!! How dare you comment on someone you don't know.....!!???? He had a few faults like we all do; unfortunately he liked to dabble in recreational drugs on occassion and was the most god-awful flirt and womaniser you were ever likely to meet!!!<br>  <br>  Verdict :MURDER. <br>  Someone at that house murdered Stuart; His head was turned by the riduculous creature that is Barrymore. He frequently used to invite people back to his house after the clubs shut.<br>  Stuart was not gay; nor did he willingly offer himself to anyone. <br>  If you could see the devestation that this has brought to the family you would not post such malicious and ignorant questions.|`|SYU4JIohaa	I think there are too many unanswered questions in this case, and if I was the family I would demand more answers, so I can't judge this man's dad for doing exactly that.<br>  <br>  Whether he was gay or not doesn't come into it - he was found dead in very suspicious circumstances and those suspicions have never been cleared.<br>  <br>  I think, for whatever reason, the full details of this case will never come to light.  The family are the ones suffering and as far as I can see have every right to question the verdict.|`|PTtKKOP2aa	Im not sure, i don't think its as clean cut as that,i reckon they lured Lubbock there with the promise of free gear and booze then did whatever they did to him.Whether or not he was a closet gay,who knows but i think Barrymores a sleeze and knows alot more about that night than he lets on.The thought of what went on turns me,what a way to go eh|`|Yyr2XKO2aa	I have no doubt Stuart Lubbock was a shirt lifter. You dont just accidentally end up at Barrymores house do you.<br>   <br>   I think basically he took drugs, drowned ..... it probably wasnt anyones fault but his own.<br>   <br>   I think his dad though cant bear the thought that his son was someone who took one for the team as it were.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Your theory sounds about right but the people who know for sure are going to stay quiet having got away with it so far.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I can't stand Michael Barrymore, but that's got nothing to do with anything else.<br>  <br>  I also believe that Lubbock was a closet homosexual, why else would he go to the house of a known homosexual to party and take drugs with other homosexuals.  He wasn't a weedy man, I highly doubt they forced those drugs upon him.  If all had ended with him living, his family would still be in denial and he would have still been going to parties to have gay sex in secret.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	No there are to many unanswered questions for my liking, it obviously wasn't just an orgy, there is compelling evidence that Lubbock was sadistically abused with some pretty horrific instruments.<br>  <br>  Some people have gone to far under the influence of drugs, and have literally got away with murder whether that's Barrymore or his acquaintances I doubt that we will ever know.<br>  <br>  Lubbock being a closet gay has got nothing to do with it, if someone abuses someone else and they die because of that abuse, then someone should be charged with murder.<br>  <br>  There is no place for get out of jail free cards for celebrities or anyone else.|`|9ADVLFOnaa	And what about the fact that he had horrific internal injuries? men can have sex without causing injury to each other. It doesn't matter what his sexual orientation was, the fact is he was found dead with serious injuries and the police fooked up at the scene. I think he was raped. Speaking as a mother I would never rest until I knew the truth if anything happened to my son.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	I suspect all the gay people in the house at the time were involved in homosexual activities and Lubbock was a willing partner who unfortunately suffered from the deviant acts.|`|AA11589988	I think Stuart Lubbock was raped by men at that party and he might have had a heart attack and died during the rape.<br>  Horrible.

zU9KQYmHaa	You'll be great!  Just make it up, and tweak it, huh?  I think you might be thinking about fictional works!  There is a huge glut of mass comm. students in college today, and fewer jobs for the ones like me and friends who've done it for years.  THere is a shift toward internet publishing, of course, but still way too many people trying to do it. Wages are way down in the field, but none of this seems to discourage students from choosing the degree.  I keep thinking your generation is going to produce  some great work, and maybe it will.  Just make sure you are the best of best, or at least pretty and well-connected.  It's not a good way to get rich!  I am now owner of a car repair business, after working my way up to news director at a radio station.  That should tell you something.  Just do what your heart wants to do.  And get really good at it.  A journalist that doesn't worry about getting all the details, as you put it, and just makes it interesting, is not much a journalist in my opinion.  Check it out and see.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  By the way, this is obviously being posted by a teacher for your class.  That's cool!

Yes after that pak will be merged with India and India will rule on that forever.<br>  <br>  Nice dream but it will soon turn into a reality,|`|jbE1nWqzaa	A known enemy is better then unknown.|`|nZkZKNySaa	If this then no Pak and no India...it will ruin everything.....|`|jgRRsG8Daa	Not to worry.Our politicians are always around waiting to welcome them with open arms.Don't forget that they constitute a new and hefty <br>  vote bank ready for the picking.They will be treated like royals.Haj<br>  subsidy will be increased.Minority institutions will get better facilities and grants.Quota system will be extended to cover them.More jobs will be specially created for them.More schools will be built for them.They will be a very pampered lot who at the first available opportunity will carry out jihad against the hand that fed them.They will then smoothly take over India which will then be renamed as Bada Pakistan.Dawood Ibrahim will be elected as the PM,Chhota Shakeel <br>  will be Dy.PM.And we idiots will have egg on our faces.|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	It is a hypothetical question. Tahrike Taliban is not strong enough to do so. This is not old Taliban of Afghanistan which controlled Afghanistan without firing a bullet in 1995, vanished in 2001. this is totally different with different mysterious purposes, unknown to all. Who funds & arms them too is not yet clear. Up til now whatever it is doing what India & Israel want. It is expected that sooner or later Zardari will resign & it will vanish. Mirza Aslam Baig can answer your question better.<br>  Indian establishment was never friendly to people of Pakistan. When Indian establishment imposes over 1 million troops to kill indiscriminately innocent Kashmiri Muslims & Sikhs in Jhelum valley, how can it be friendly for people of pakistan ?  Indian forces are NOT capable of containing Pakistani forces which was clear in Kargil conflict of 77 days. Bill Clinton had to beg on behalf of Vajpaee to ask Nawaz Sahrif for ordering cease fire. In that only irregulars were involved, not Pakistani army. USA wants to make a fast free trade route from Kazakhstan to India via Afghanistan & Pakistan which neither of the above two nations want. To make way for that , USA is playing double game at some pretexts, many opine in that zone of turmoil. If that is the case , Mariotte Hotel blast in Islamabad(In Ramazan month which none Muslim will ever think of doing in ones wildest dreams)& Operation Mumbai is understandable.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	If at a stange Pakistan wants, India shall send its troops to help Pakistan and this Taliban group shall be writen off from the soil of pakistan.|`|80fWQyDnaa	thinkin so much ! tough question !|`|jfOSVSQkaa	If Pakistan is taken over by the Taliban, there may not be any India left, they would certainly want to attack India next.  The question you should be asking is "What will happen to India if pakistan is Talibanized".   In my opinion there is very little chance of happening but this forum is only for the sake of argument.|`|CJVExCagaa	Who told u that they are  innocents. Have we hindus forgotten the Genocide of 1947<br>  We must help Talibaan to crush Pakistan.<br>  In fact Pakistan betrayed taliban as well as Afganistan.

That would be like saying drivers are responsible for strikes in automotive manufacturing plants.<br>    <br>  By legalization and regulation of currently illegal drugs, it would lower prices and result in reduced demand, reduced deaths, and reduced violence in Mexico AND the U.S. - a solution that is valid, proven, but politically impossible given the stupidity of the politics and American society, in general...

They could legalize drug use, make it in the states, tax it, and bankrupt the mexican drug cartels.I believe in personal responsibility. When there is violence and death, the person creating the violence and death is the cause of the violence and death. If a person is killed by a gun, it is not the fault of the gun company, or the ammo company or the manufacturer of the shoes he happens to be wearing at the time, it is the killers fault, his alone!|`|59295cf18bb3e6743c4d316953521282aa	No Demand = No Offer<br>  <br>  Or What else do you think this "Recesion" and Lost Jobs is about?<br>  <br>  Also most weapons used by the Cartels are manufactured in USA.

Did you know that the English used to refer to the pox (syphilis) as the French disease? Or that that British soldiers in WW1 used to complain that the French were the great unwashed? Or that my grandad used to say "Don't trust the French as allies, cos they always run away when the enemy are in sight"?? Obviously that means that all French people are immoral, dirty and cowardly! Or does it? Probably not, its just one perception by near neighbours - (and rivals).<br>  As for the collapse of England? I fear that has already happened, engineered by the leftist elite, mainly scottish politicians. How many of our youngsters know about English history or traditions?

5ac40eaae3a66dcd680cf6c728f414adaa	At least five years...  They are talking about the possibility, arguably, the need for nationalizing some of the largest US banks, some of the largest in the world.  That situation alone ain't something fixable in less than two years.  You  need inside information, something closer to the "truth" than what is available over popular media.  With the possibility of a recession/depression looming, this isn't any time to be extending yourself financially.  Hunker down, dear.  <br>  <br>  MY wife is hot on buying a larger apartment.  (We don't live in USA, but our economy is directly related to the USA economy...)  I have students in banking (and our "inside information" source)  whose work is in the mortgage/personal finance business and ALL tell me to wait for at least another year before making any serious moves.  We've been waiting over a year, now, and I don't have to convince my wife to wait for another five.  News yesterday was that we may have to wait into 2010.  Well, duh...  It's all a confidence game - and realistic decisions won't include confidence, hope, or worry in your decision-making process, okay?

Klp0Mv6kaa	Suppose you are asked to listen to what two people say about something that happened some 60 years ago.Suppose that one of these two is the man who was not even born then,while another is the live witness of the events who ,besides,lived in the area.<br>  Whose words would your believe more?<br>  Below you will see,what the arabs who lived 60 years ago –among them the then Syrian Prime Minister Khaled al-Azm, the secretary of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee Emile Ghoury ,the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said, the current President of the Palestinian Authority Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas), King Hussein and many others who lived then and were witnesses of the events – have to say about the REAL roots of the refugee problem.<br>  Read-and compare with what you hear from your leaders - who were not even born 60 years ago – today.The quotes belong exclusively to ARAB politicians and journalists and  are taken  only from ARAB newspapers and magazines<br>  1. “The fact that there are these refugees is the direct consequence<br>  of the act of the Arab states in opposing partition and the Jewish<br>  state. The Arab states agreed upon this policy unanimously and they<br>  must share in the solution of the problem.” – Emile Ghoury, secretary<br>  of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, in an interview with the<br>  Beirut Telegraph September 6, 1948. (same appeared in The London<br>  Telegraph, August 1948);<br>  2. “It must not be forgotten that the Arab Higher Committee<br>  encouraged the refugees’ flight from their homes in Jaffa, Haifa, and<br>  Jerusalem”. -- Near East Arabic Broadcasting Station, Cyprus, April 3, 1949.<br>  3. “The Arab states which had encouraged the Palestine Arabs to<br>  leave their homes temporarily in order to be out of the way of the Arab<br>  invasion armies, have failed to keep their promise to help these refugees.”<br>  – The Jordanian daily newspaper Falastin, February 19, 1949.<br>  4. “The Secretary General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha,<br>  assured the Arab peoples that the occupation of Palestine and of Tel<br>  Aviv would be as simple as a military promenade...Brotherly advice<br>  was given to the Arabs of Palestine to leave their land, homes, and<br>  property to stay temporarily In neighboring fraternal states, lest the<br>  guns of invading Arab armies mow them down.” --Al Hoda, a New<br>  York-based Lebanese daily, June 8, 1951.<br>  5. “Who brought the Palestinians to Lebanon as refugees, suffering<br>  now from the malign attitude of newspapers and communal<br>  leaders, who have neither honour nor conscience? Who brought them<br>  over in dire straits and penniless, after they lost their honor? The<br>  Arab states, and Lebanon amongst them, did it.” -- The Beirut Muslim<br>  weekly Kul-Shay, August 19, 1951<br>  6.10. “The Arab governments told us: Get out so that we can get in.<br>  So we got out, but they did not get in.” A refugee quoted in Al Difaa<br>  (Jordan) September 6, 1954.<br>  7.“The wholesale exodus was due partly to the belief of the<br>  Arabs, encouraged by the boasting of an unrealistic press and the irresponsible<br>  utterances of some of the Arab leaders that it could be only<br>  a matter of some weeks before the Jews were defeated by the armies<br>  of the Arab states, and the Palestinian Arabs enabled to re-enter and<br>  re-take possession of their country”. -- Edward Atiyah (Secretary of<br>  the Arab League, London, The Arabs, 1955, p. 183)<br>  8.“The 15th May, 1948, arrived ... On that day the mufti of<br>  Jerusalem appealed to the Arabs of Palestine to leave the country,<br>  because the Arab armies were about to enter and fight in their stead.”<br>  -- The Cairo daily Akhbar el Yom, October 12, 1963.<br>  9.In listing the reasons for the Arab failure in 1948, Khaled al-<br>  Azm (Syrian Prime Minister) notes that “…the fifth factor was the call<br>  by the Arab governments to the inhabitants of Palestine to evacuate<br>  it (Palestine) and leave for the bordering Arab countries. Since 1948,<br>  it is we who have demanded the return of the refugees, while it is<br>  we who made them leave. We brought disaster upon a million Arab<br>  refugees by inviting them and bringing pressure on them to leave. We<br>  have accustomed them to begging...we have participated in lowering<br>  their morale and social level...Then we exploited them in executing<br>  crimes of murder, arson and throwing stones upon men, women and<br>  children...all this in the service of political purposes...” -- Khaled el-<br>  Azm, Syrian prime minister after the 1948 War, in his 1972 memoirs,<br>  published in 1973.<br>  9..“The Arab states succeeded in scattering the Palestinian<br>  people and in destroying their unity. They did not recognize them as<br>  a unified people until the states of the world did so, and this is regrettable.The<br>  Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the<br>  Zionist tyranny, but instead they abandoned them, forced them to<br>  emigrate and to leave their homeland, imposed upon them a political<br>  and ideological blockade and threw them into prisons similar to the<br>  ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe.”-- Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas), from the official journal of the PLO, Falastin el-Thawra (“What We Have Learned and What We<br>  Should Do”), Beirut, March 1976.|`|7lkLZ57Saa	Ah, complicated, complicated...<br>  <br>  The truth is that historians are pretty split, especially since the Israelis partially opened their archives in the 1980s, and there are Arabs and Israelis on both sides of the argument.<br>  <br>  The truth is probably a combination of the two - threats and violence by the Israelis and a call to leave by Arab governments.<br>  <br>  Here is a quote from a Jewish historian regarding the documents released in the 1980s.<br>  <br>  "...for what the new documents reveal is that there were both far more explusions and atrocities by Israeli troops than tabulated in th[e] book's first edition* and, at the same time, far more orders and advices to various communities by Arab officials and officers to quit their villages fuelling the exodus".<br>  Benny Morris, Professor of History at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev<br>  *referring to his first book<br>  <br>  *******<br>  You can understand the Israeli and Arab bias but what is most concerning is that, with so much debate and uncertainty, most Americans have chosen one interpretation to feed their hatred of one side (often religiously based).

Is it because Jews are poorly fertile than other religious groups?|`|wQwufvKNaa	BECAUSE SOME OF THEM DID NOT COME FROM THE CAMPS, THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. <br>  <br>  UNLESS THEY DID WHAT GOD TOLD THEM TO DO, AND THAT IS MULTIPLY THE EARTH.|`|mMpdRCk0aa	I'll just copy and paste my answer from the question that you repeated:<br>  <br>  Arabs like having kids.<br>  Deal with it.<br>  <br>  Well, here are some Genocides for you to look over :<br>  <br>  "-- Tira, December 11, 1947 - five Palestinians were killed and six injured;<br>  <br>  -- a village outside Haifa, December 12, 1947 - 12 Palestinians killed;<br>  <br>  -- a village outside Tel Aviv, December 14, 1947 - 18 Palestinians killed and 100 injured;<br>  <br>  -- al-Khias, December 18, 1947 - the paramilitary Haganah killed 10 Palestinians, most inside their homes;<br>  <br>  -- Haifa, December 30, 1947 - six Palestinians killed and 42 wounded;<br>  <br>  -- Jerusalem, December 30, 1947 - Irgun terrorists threw a bomb from a speeding car killing 11 Palestinians and two Brits;<br>  <br>  -- Balad Esh-Sheikh, December 31, 1947 - the Haganah killed 60 Palestinians, most inside their homes;<br>  <br>  -- Jaffa, January 4, 1948 - the Stern Gang killed up to 30 and wounded 100 in a truck bombing;<br>  <br>  -- the Semiramis Hotel, Jerusalem, January 4, 1948 - the Haganah bombed the hotel killing 25 civilians;<br>  <br>  -- Jaffa Gate, Jerusalem, January 7, 1948 - 17 Palestinians killed;<br>  <br>  -- Tireh, February 10, 1948 - seven Palestinians killed and five injured;<br>  <br>  -- on a bus from Safad, February 12, 1948 - five Palestinians killed and five injured;<br>  <br>  -- Sa'sa', February 14, 1948 - 60 Palestinians killed, mostly in their homes;<br>  <br>  -- Qisarya, February 15 - 20, 1948 - 25 Palestinians killed;<br>  <br>  -- Haifa, February 20, 1948 - six Palestinians killed and 36 wounded;<br>  <br>  -- Haifa, March 3, 1948 - the Stern Gang blew up the Salameh Building killing 11 Palestinians and wounding 27;<br>  <br>  -- al-Husayniyya, March 12 and 16 - 17 - the Palmach twice raided the village killing 15 and wounding 20 in the first attack;

O71xlcG3aa	I read some where that things like plane crashes and school bombings happen in multiples.  Like when one plane crashes at least two more will crash.  I don't know if that true.  Its almost like it probably happens more than we think but the media chooses to highlight them when they happen close together.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No more than usual just fashionable to report them as extensively. The media will lose interest given time.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No, We can with modern communications get stories on crahses instantly from anywhere on the planet. If could count the amount of fliers in the air for one any given day, vs the amount in cars, dying from crahses, the auto crashes is way way way higher. On any given day autos are more dangerous to be in.|`|ERfdiUaVaa	Media has been reporting every single incident this week.

This plane was on approach to land...it was just a few miles from the airport which makes me believe that they had slowed down considerably and were on approach.  Unlike Flight 93 which was pretty much driven into the ground at what i am guessing was a very high speed.  And at that point we do not know who was actually flying the plane. That flight was not trying to "land", the passengers on that plan had entered the cockpit and more then likely struggled with the hijackers knowing that if they did not down the plane then the plane would likely end up buried inside a washington building.  See the difference????|`|estIQEVNaa	Dude, how can you compare that to 9/11?  The planes on that day hit something a lot faster and infrastructures.  The Turkish plane that crashed today hit ground and wasn't going AS fast because they were about to land.|`|kXc5WbDlaa	Yes I did. There were no pilots in it. This plane was flown by remote control. It crashed because it had reached the limit of the signal.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	were you there?|`|O71xlcG3aa	what the heck are you talking about?  of course there is a plane visible, they hit the ground when they were getting ready to land they didn't fly head first into a skyscraper.|`|acbqsZZbaa	The Turkish plane crashed on landing, which means that it was coming in low, slow and at a gentle angle.<br>  Flight 77 went into a concrete building at full throttle. Flight 93 went into the ground like a lawn dart. Both of them left large amounts of debris and there were eye witnesses to both crashes.

And that's gonna be hard because Clinton holds it so far.<br>  <br>  So far in my lifetime I have not seen an American President stop "pork spending."  There is way too much spending in the current bill before the House and every stimulus package has spending.<br>  <br>  Now, did you notice how many hand claps our President received.  This is a popular President, but when a President really does something he goes against the grain and not so many people like him.<br>  If he stops "pork spending" there will be fewer and fewer clapping of hands in that house.  Pelosi is getting her way or she wouldn't be putting on such a big show.  This is a "pork spending" woman.<br>  <br>  Our President said he'd make all the financial decisions public.  Our people need to command that all financial decisions are made public and if they aren't Congress should answer.  The government has spent their way into letting this country have a 40 trillion domestic debt.  This is said to be all debt.  Someone needs to ask our government if they are their brother's keeper.  Sometimes  the people in the know need to protect the people who do not know.  The government let regulations cease from existing and the big fat bribery guys won the regulation war.<br>  In otherwords our government sold out to bribes.<br>  <br>  One thing our President said in which I totally agree and that is the resilence of the American people who will pay off this debt and make a come back.  We have molecular manufacturing coming which will require many regulations.  We are the nation who invented the automobile and we will reinvent it to be energy efficient.  Since 1973, this nation has known that we must be energy sufficient and find alternative fuels.  Our government has lagged behind because of big oil companies and their influence in politics.  The days of big oil companies are gone.  We invented these alternative energy sources and we must use them.  We have many capped off oil wells that have not been brought alive.  <br>  <br>  America will rise to the occasion, because we always have.

The adults who were responsible for him fell down and they should suffer the consequences for their failures.  The woman, Kenzie, paid with her life.  She should not have taken up with a man she was not married to who had a responsibility to Jordan and she should not have foisted her two daughters on Jordan.  She should not have been laying in bed when it was time for her daughter and Jordan to leave for school.  She should not have pulled down her pants and jumped into bed with Jordan's dad last year and made a new step brother for Jordan without marrying first.  Jordan's dad should not have bought a firearm for Jordan without keeping a trigger lock on it and all other firearms in the house.  <br>  <br>  The adults around this child failed him, children are by nature impulsive and they need to be protected from their own impulses by responsible adults who are not wrapped up in their own love lives.  Certainly Kenzie's family is devastated but to act like the way she lived her life in 2008 since meeting Jordan's dad is alright is wrong!|`|2zOSXL4yaa	I think so it was a calculated act and by 11 people are aware of what will happen if you shoot some one in the head with a shotgun, No doubt people will try to blame it on violent video games and marilyn manson.|`|66eKcJE3aa	No, not at age 11. He should be evaluated and be given the appropriate treatment. There is still a chance that he could be a productive member of society.|`|qUiuRDs6aa	of corse he should there is obviously something wrong with him, obv is not all there in the head, he needs to be tried as an adult and serve his time in prison with psychiatrial help|`|Aj2r93u7aa	He should be hung from the highest tree.<br>  <br>  Commit murder...<br>  <br>  You should die.|`|O71xlcG3aa	well there is obviously something wrong with this kid.  he needs constant supervision and psychological testing because it wouldn't be safe to release him back to his father.  I don't really think there should be a trial, they know he did it and now they need to get him help.  Its sad because he will probably spend the next twenty years of his life in jail but I guess my question would be did he know better?  if yes then he should be tried and sentenced as an adult.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My opinion may be a bit biased since I actually knew Kenzie while i was living in New Castle about 8 years ago...<br>  <br>  The father will not be charged...but should be held partially responsible.. He has made threats and said things about not liking the fact that Kenzie and his father were together.. Sadly we are not required to keep guns locked up and away from kids in the state of PA, nor are you required to register such guns... sucks yes..stupid, yes..we have to change these laws.<br>  <br>  Now..what makes an 11 year old tick? To the point where he is sooo jealous that he actually kills someone? I think that for the time being the child needs to go to an adolecent psych ward...not the freaking county jail that can't even house him.. Kenzie would stick up and defend him over her own children just to try to make him feel at home, and feel loved, his own mother has not been around for the past 11 years his father has been raising him. They did not seek help because no one thought that he would actually kill her, or her children. They thought he was just jealous and it was a "phase" that he was going through.. Many people out there are guilty of the same thing.. Children being brought together with mixed families are often jealous of the new girlfriend, or other children. <br>  <br>  Kenzie and the boy's father have been only living together for 5 months when all of this happend, and the boy has been saying this stuff for a couple of months, I think they were doing a type of "wait and see" approach with him being jealous.. I will repeat again.. NO ONE thought he would actually do this! <br>  <br>  He IS going to be charged as an adult, no matter how we feel about this, or what we say about this.. In the state of PA, if you are 10 years old and kill somone with premeditation, you ARE charged as an adult.<br>  <br>  He killed not only Kenzie, but also the baby that was inside of her...i say baby because had she have been found right after it had happend, the child would have had the chance to survive... he is being charged with killing this un born child as well. <br>  <br>  I think that there could be a chance that if he gets help that he would not kill again as an adult.. I think he should get say about 25 years in jail.. first in juvie, then send him to a regular jail once he turns 21... it's usually 21 in our state that you can't go to juivie anymore. <br>  <br>  This is how I feel about it.|`|EVwllMNqaa	No,<br>  <br>  I think he knows what he did. But we have laws that say you have to be 18..if they think 16 is the age change the law if they think 11 is it change the law , and when do we get to putting one years old babies in jail?That is the problem now we make laws and we break them when we think it is right..BULSH*T|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	let the criminal justice system decide what should happen..he will recieve a full pysch evaluation and professionals will make proper decisions|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	no because he's young enough to be rehabilitated.

5RqvVmKaaa	The same reasons that most other trivial things get blown out of proportion by the BBC, Sky, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 and the news papers - they can't live without bad news so they make even normal things sound bad; they think we find it all interesting; and they believe in their own spin. I think I have to stop watching the news and listening to radio stations that talk about the news because they just make so much trivia into news and they just talk about negatives all the time.

We need to invest in the postal service and re-open the post offices across the country, which were closed by New Labour, in preparation for privatisation. The Socialist Party were part of a campaign to save post offices in Leicester – now we need to do the same thing across the country to make the government change its mind.<br>    <br>  We have seen the disaster that privatisation has brought to our railways, with inflated ticket prices, overcrowding and a poor service.

AA11464625	In my opinion there are two types of party members and they are the blind partisan and the party member who will liston to reason if it helps the country. I am a Republican but I am not blind to the fact that the man is trying. The way some of those radio talk show host talk about the man you would think he is conspiring against America or a Communist. I really do not see how those two (you know who I am talking about) are really helping our country. How is that being a great American? Besides, if Obama did everything right some Republicans (just like some Demarcate would if it were reversed) would still  find something wrong with the man. I see them as a hindrance. In my opinion, I think President Obama is trying because I can see it in him. We can talk all we want about ways to fix the country but it will be awhile before we see results. The Republicans had a chance and screwed it up (yes I voted McCain) so lets at least give this man a far shot. Now I ask, how is that un-American?|`|61bd799b360ce91a3154d9c71b5ae4deaa	1.   The President needs to either speak in positive terms, or sit down and shut up.   The economy and the markets is all about confidence.

No one is bringing this up, but it's a fact that will someday have to be addressed. The only reason money is actually worth anything is when it is backed by something of value.When we were on the gold standard, every dollar in circulation was backed by that much gold in Fort Knox.At that time an ounce of gold was worth $35. Now we are no longer on the gold standard and an ounce of gold is worth over $1000.The entire worlds economy is built on a fraud that is just now starting to bite us.If you print money up out of thin air, with nothing to back it up, it's worth is actually zero.Think about it!|`|GnQ9bc8vaa	Give tax cuts to the business owners.

He did not write the bill, several other people did.  I think that if he sat down and really put pen to paper who could hash out an excellent package.  I have said it several times, I believe there needs to be an extreme overhaul in the welfare system.  Not to stimulate the economy but to allow for more funds to be redirected to help fix it.  Tax breaks for the poor?  Come on, I am in that area considered "poor" by these tax cuts and I don't pay any taxes as it is!  I get ALL of the money I paid in PLUS some at the end of the year.  Tax breaks need to go to small business owners and richer people.  I can pretend all I want that I hold purchase power, but at the end of the day the truth is rich people are the ones that need the breaks.  You keep raising their taxes and they are going to keep tightening their purse strings.  At the end of it all, you will have poor people buying what poor people buy (cheap stuff) and rich people putting their money into their banks, or if the economy keeps going the way it is, they will start pulling their money out and hiding it under their mattresses again.  <br>  <br>  There is no easy solution.  There are an awful lot of things that need to be fixed that were broken by prior administrations (Bush isn't the only one to blame.  You all need to spread that blame around).  I am not president though, and I can not see the truth about what is going on.  We only see parts of the problem, but a person in Obama's position gets to see the bigger picture.  I know one thing is for sure, if he doesn't fix things people are going to give him an even harder time than they gave Bush.  That can be guaranteed.|`|AA11593971	Give every adult in the USA $1000 in "script." The reason you give them script is that it MUST be spent in 90 days or it becomes worthless. That will still cost less than the Obama plan. What will happen is that people will spend the money on what is important to them immediately... stimulating the economy AND helping the population. Businesses where the script is spent turn it in to local banks for real money.<br>  <br>  PS: My husband has submitted this suggestion through a website looking for ideas to stimulate the economy.

If we borrow it from China, when we have to pay it back, out of money we have to print with nothing to back it, inflation is going to surge beyond belief. The point I am making is get ready for a loaf of bread to cost $10 in the future.

Mr. Cameron's son's death is UK news and I believe it deserves more prominence than a foreign plane crash in a foreign country.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Although it is sad that he died,I think it is a blessing in disguise.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	It clearly should be the top story as at least 9 people have reportedly died in the crash.<br>  <br>  I have every sympathy with Cameron for his loss, but I think the media are prone to being manipulated by the main political parties (NOT by the party leader himself - I don't think Cameron is that crass or cold) to get political capital and public sympathy over what should be a wholly private tragedy.<br>  <br>  Labour were absolutely furious when the story of Blair's son being drunk and comatose in Leicester Square leaked out, because it cast him in a negative light as a parent. <br>  <br>  For similar reasons, they clamped down hard on stories about Blair's daughter's mental health problems and her suicide attempt, to the extent that they never appeared in any mainstream newspaper (except for oblique mentions of Blair's "family problems" and "pressures").<br>  <br>  However, stories like Cameron's son's death can be fed to the media as tragedies with which we can all sympathise.<br>  <br>  For anyone who doubts the parties are this cold and cynical, remember that one Labour goon's first response to the 9/11 attacks was to say it was a "good day to bury bad news"! It's in the nature of such people to think and act this way, and I don't believe the Tories are any better than Labour on this score.|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	any child's death is important, especially a child that has suffered from birth, he didn't ask to be afflicted with cerebral palsy, sad to that 10 people died whilst on a plane taking them voluntarily to their destination. i buried my 21 year old son (also severely afflicted with cerebral palsy) 10 years ago the hole it leaves is as big as an air crash! i hope you never have to experience anything like it. being a stranger doesn't come into it, being human does!|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	The plane crash was a Turkish plane, so it has less relevance to the UK.  Just like if a prominent Turkish politician's son died, that would get few reports in the UK and vice versa.<br>  <br>  That isn't to say that all life is not of equal value, but whether an event is news worthy is based on all sorts of other factors weighrd up by news editors, they are not judgements on the value of human life.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	P File you clearly have no children but then your name suggest you have other ideas of what children should be used for.<br>  <br>  A child has died and I will openly admit to crying for that little boy this morning.

As a parent loosing your child is the worst pain you could ever imagine, David Cameron is probably also our next PM thats why its such a big deal. <br>  The plane crash killed nine adults, all foreign to the Uk, when a UK child of the future PM dies thats big.

The Cameron's have suffered a loss you can't begin to imagine if it hasn't happened to you, and they have asked people to respect their privacy.<br>  <br>  The BBC are spending more time on a story that has happened in the UK and I can't see the problem with that.  They are not burying stories about the crash but they are rightly spending time on a story based in the UK.

It can defeat any currently known missile defence system, not that anyone seriously expected missile defence systems to do anything but suck up buckets of defence dollars (exactly as they ere designed to do.)    However Iran's limited warhead capacity, limited space program, and just generally limited everything means this not only is no threat, it's not even much of a second strike capability. So more than likely this is just a satellite, as Iran claims it is.    This does give Iran the ability to launch spy satellites, which certainly is a big jump up in military capabilities. Again though this is more defencive than offencive. Despite the endless nonsense spewed by the western media, Iran's military capabilities, especially offencive ones, are very modest.    And yes, Iran's space program is perfectly legal.|`|BGVqTSXXaa	did you know Iraq/ Saddam Hussein had WMDs?

5vqo3XzHaa	Obama lives in a fantasy world, as evidenced by a remark he said during his first speech on foreign policy, which of all the nerve, was given to an Arab network to televise and not an American network.  He was speaking to the Arab world, and specifically the terrorists, when he said "America is not your enemy."  I wonder if Obama was in a coma when we were attacked on 9-11-01!  He has this idiotic mentality that we can all live in peace, the US and our enemies, and we should just put the past behind us and work towards global peace.  Hogwash!  It's this warped kind of thinking that explains why he didn't address N. Korea or Iran.  He probably thinks all that's needed to handle the situation is simply for him to speak a few words to the leaders of N. Korea and Iran, and they will just bow down and do his bidding.  Like I said, Obama is living in a fantasy world.|`|ytQfxuPyaa	The econmy is more important than starting another war.

Have never heard that term and I have close to 20 years experience.    The lede is something that tells the reader what the article is about. It should grab the reader's attention too.    A story about music and how it affects the personality would most likely be a health article as it affects mental health. It could also fall into the feature cat depending on how you approached the research and writing.      Retired reporter

AA11015890	I agree that the cost of country-wide specialist equipment can't be justified.  However, it still beggars belief how this nation responds to snow!  Back in the seventies, schools remained open and people went about their business as normal - even with the knowledge that the buses could be withdrawn at any moment.    The reports I've just seen on T.V show areas with a so-so snow fall - at least here in the North - and nothing like enough to bring everything to a standstill.|`|68fb03024934c658d5d8d8795f5b89a9aa	yep its a justifiable excuse. Britain is one of if not the most mild and non severe/ safest countries in the world in terms of weather and natural disasters. Only increased river flooding seems to be becoming a problem but even that is hardly severe.    I'd rather the country came to a standstill once every four years than have the government taxing and controlling us further trying to fund for measures to counter severe weather. Besides it gives us all a nice unexpected day off, as we don't have enough bank holidays anyway.|`|35fe1a8416fedbc485116527db4594acaa	i think he has a point ,but we do seem to go down without a fight|`|zjgQtEXsaa	Ask a Ice road trucker!|`|0clmolLraa	crap drivers...it's always the same even with advanced warning....|`|DUECo3eAaa	yes its true..we dont often get severe weather,,and its still snowing lol..|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	think about it snowing in Florida.  my niece in Alaska knows about snow.    they're not use to that kind of weather.  it is out of the ordinary.|`|UxMBrfruaa	We haven't had this much snow in about 18 years.

These are (or were):    Buckinghamshire  Essex  Hertfordshire  Berkshire  Middlesex  Kent  Surrey  East Sussex  West Sussex    I think the idea behind the term was that someone could have a home in one of these counties, and still be able to travel in and out of London for work every day. Hence Home Counties.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The Home Counties are those counties which directly border greater London - Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Surrey and Sussex.

6bddae3054027d8540fd9bd8cf82276eaa	Good subject - FDR's Treasurer finally admitted after 7 years of spending that spending was the wrong thing to do.  World War 2 ended the depression, not the New Deal.  By making our economy seem worse, he is affecting the economy, the stock market, trading, the job market - all of it ties into fear.  It would also give him the excuse to pass his "stimulus" bill, which is really a payoff for all of the groups, unions, committees that supported him and his "promises".    The economy is worse second only to Jimmy Carter's presidency, but who do you hear reporting THAT one??    Try checking out www.askHeritage.org.  Good luck!!

Blogs are just written  opinions.|`|gvtjyrsBaa	Both journalism and blogging are forms of mass communication.<br>  <br>  Journalism is a profession that requires training and talent. Journalists are trained to be expert observers, and are expected to maintain some degree of objectivity and to conform to a set of ethical standards (see source links for the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics). Traditional journalistic outlets include newspapers as well as broadcast technologies such as radio and television.<br>  <br>  Blogging is a new form of mass communication using Internet technology. The technology allows the broad dissemination of information and opinion by practically everybody, not just trained journalists.<br>  <br>  This has "democratized" mass media. Today, there are blogs dealing with nearly all aspects of the human experience, many of which traditional journalism has no way of addressing. <br>  <br>  By the same token, however, blogs are not expected to adhere to the same set ethical standards that journalists are. Nor are most amateur bloggers able to engage in the kind of investigative journalism that paid journalists are. Many blogs merely react to and reprint journalists, instead of generating their own original material.<br>   <br>  There is a set of standards evolving among the blogging community, however, and bloggers have their own ethics regarding attribution and fairness. Furthermore, professional journalists are, more and more, expected to write blogs as part of their job description. <br>  <br>  Blogs are becoming just another medium of mass communication. And, when judging the quality of the information one reads on a blog, one must carefully consider that blog's publisher--just the same as with a newspaper, or radio or TV station.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	I would say no because blogs are more of a person's opinions/feelings on a certain topic. Journalism is more research and fact-based.|`|AA11318212	there are some sites yes.<br>  in fact i had a friend who wrote for newsweek and had a on line blog that was purely journalistic.<br>  <br>  Journalism defined: The art of writing for publication in news papers and other periodicals, embracing all thoughts and actions that have significance and interest to the readers.<br>  <br>  Roughly, divided into six categorizes:<br>  - newspapers<br>  - general magazines, reviews<br>  -professional journals or newsletters<br>  -news magazines and magazine digests<br>  -radio and television<br>  -New media (internet, multimedia)<br>  <br>  if you go to wikipedia.com and search for type of blogs or kind of blogs you will see that there would be journalist/news type of blogs listed. Good luck!

ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	Who knows what happened to them? Maybe they were killed or being held at FEMA camps. It is possible that there weren't any people on the planes. The technology to remotely fly a plane does exist. What tipped me off about that, is one guy called his mother, and said his entire name in introduction. I don't know about you, but I don't know of anybody who calls their mother and greets them with their first and last name. ALSO, I don't understand how so many phone calls were recorded at all. Is it normal procedure to record phone calls that are placed from planes? Or were the people who were being called recording the conversations? And then there's this lady, she doesn't sound right either:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7mNV4a...|`|EagOe74laa	Firstly let's assume that 911 was a conspiracy. Not that I believe that.  Why would they use fighter planes and not commercial planes? Seems to me that whoever would have been in charge of that would have KNOWN that there's a visual difference and a structural difference and I saw the video on the news the day it happened. Those looked like commercial planes to me.  Now let's assume that again it is a conspiracy, so what happened to the passengers. Well were there any on the plane in the first place? Would seem like whoever was in charge of this great big play would in fact know they couldn't just trash 200+ americans so they surely wouldn't use people but the US government has been known to use it's own people in horrible ways so we can assume that there were passengers. They probably blew up. I mean air plane fuel burns at such high temps that even the ash would burn up.  Personally I think 911 was a true terrorist attack funded by people in America. Rather it was the government or individuals.  Simple though is who cares, nothing can be done about, the american government lies and abuses it powers and nothing will ever be done about it until we're all living in a post civilized USA.   So instead of being worried about what kind of conspiracies there are out there instead think of how you and your loved ones can survive the next one. Maybe start building a deep underground home,

AA10153220	First of all, a journalism degree isn't necessary to be a journalist - it's more about experience.  So if you go to any college for a bachelor's degree you should be fine.  The more important thing is working at your college publications, and getting internships in your area.    That being said, you can also choose to major in journalism as an undergraduate (which is 4 years), or get a journalism master's degree afterward (usually under a year).    Some good schools:  Columbia University (master's only)  University of California - Berkeley (master's only)  Northwestern University  University of Southern California  University of Missouri    Best of luck!
