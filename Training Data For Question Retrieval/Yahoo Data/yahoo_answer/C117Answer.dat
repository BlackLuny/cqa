Ca8i226Xaa	I believe that less than half of the money is going to stimulate the economy, namely money spend on US infrastructure and tax cuts. The rest is mainly fluff and pork to pay back those people who supported Obama and the Dems, the Hollywood elite, ACORN, planned parenthood, teachers, etc.    Kudlow knows what he is talking about!    Shelve The Stimulus  By Lawrence Kudlow January 31, 2009  http://www.gopusa.com/commentary/lkudlow...  Wednesday night's House tally on the Democratic stimulus package, where not a single Republican voted in favor, was another shot across the bow for this incredibly unmanageable $900 billion behemoth of a program that truly will not stimulate the economy. Sure, the Democrats won on a party-line count. But Team Obama is now regrouping in the face of mounting criticism of this package.    GOP economist Martin Feldstein revoked his prior support of a stimulus plan in Wednesday's Washington Post. "In its current form," Feldstein wrote, "(the plan) does too little to raise national spending and employment. It would be better for the Senate to delay legislation for a month, or even two, if that's what it takes to produce a much better bill. We cannot afford an $800 billion mistake."|`|JdOhkCPAaa	it doesnt work . what is happening is the govt is taking OUR money and trying to create growth with it or giving it to those who havent got it - it is a ponzi scheme and will destroy what is left of the REAL economy .Maybe not overnight but eventually yes -     why? because you take from those who have a little money(the rich and corporations have loopholes not to pay). pay it out to those that dont (with much less benefit to the economy) than just leaving it with those  that have it and would spend it .then go back to the smaller pool of those who have each time for even greater amounts of money taking more and more into poverty each time .|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	http://appropriations.house.gov/pdf/Pres...

Still...perhaps I've helped somehow.)|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	This package will do very little to stimulate the economy and what stimulation it will give will be lost quickly once the projects are completed. It is not until the PEOPLE in this country feel sure in their jobs that they will start spending freely again. That means that the best place to put the money is into helping businesses to maintain their viability...so that they don't need to lay off workers. We should not be giving money out to businesses like was done to the big banks, AIG etc...without strings attached. Providing enough cash to a well run and up until recently profitable business so they can afford to hold out until the people start spending again is the answer. Secure the jobs first. Then when people start spending a little, another round of financial assistance to businesses to grow jobs.

gWMMD81Jaa	Most people who want an minimum wage increase don't understand that employers have to come up with the extra money to pay their employees. What is the easiest way to make money to cover the increase? Raise the price of goods. Prices of things go up every time. Yes, you might make more, but now you are paying more. Then you are back to the beginning. Also, if you have employees that make above the minimum wage, they expect an increase too. After all, they feel they deserve more than minimum wage. So now you're paying an increase of the employee making below minimum wage and for the employees making above minimum wage.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yeah, right, minimum wage is what caused the Wall Street financial firms to fail.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Look at the stupid liberals who say "prove it'.

It doesn't create jobs.  When you increase the costs associated with a business there are only a few things that can happen.      1. Owner will take less profits or shareholders (majority of shareholders are your and mine retirement accounts)  2. Cut cost by hiring less people and making the others work more (usually do more work in the same time)  3. Raise cost of products, which is the same as a tax on everyone who buys those products  4. Lastly, a combination of all of these (most likely)    If you take minimum wage to its logical conclusion, then you would raise the wage on every industry to a level where everyone can live life with all the necessities and even some extras.  If you raised the wage to say, $20 an hour, what would happen?  Think about it.  There has been great research done on this subject and many studies show that the vast majority of minimum wage earners are teenagers living with mom and dad.  Do they need a minimum wage?  Further, studies show that very few people are even on minimum wage and even fewer are on there for more than a year.  So reality is people quickly move up from that spot and make much more.  McDonald's starting wage is somewhere around 7.50-8 dollars!|`|xAjJ6QW6aa	People do deserve to have a fair salary, but I do understand your point about how many businesses that at this point are verily surviving (the general crisis) and now they got another hit.

He is actually quite an intelligent and makes excellent points, albeit with a taste of derision aimed at liberal insanity. Probably why they don't listen.

Most people who consider themselves to be Moderate are really Conservative but they do not want to be ridiculed by their Liberal Friends.  Ronald Reagan did not win 49 of 50 States having only Conservatives vote for him.  When he began seeking the nomination many people said the same things about him that you are now saying about Rush.      But, when the case is made for Conservative ideals by someone who really knows what he is talking about and can clearly explain them to masses of people and contrast them against Liberal ideals, Conservatism wins, every time.    That is why the Left do not debate Limbaugh, why they do not ask you to listen to him and listen to Liberal talk shows and decide for yourself but instead do everything to discredit him or even use the Fairness Doctrine to silence him.  The Liberals have build an impressive but phony castle and Rush Limbaugh is capable of showing everyone that it is actually just a facade.      There is currently no man on earth the Left fears more than Rush Limbaugh.  They fear him for the same reason the Right does not fear Keith Olberman.

This item has sparked calls for an investigation, because the chief lobbyist of the National Parks Association is the son of Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wisc. The $2,25 billion is about equal to the National Park Services entire annual budget. The Washington Times reports it is a threefold increase over what was originally proposed for parks in the stimulus bill. Obey is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  ? $335 million for treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.  ? $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. $4.19 billion to stave off foreclosures via the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The bill allows nonprofits to compete with cities and states for $3.44 billion of the money, which means a substantial amount of it will be captured by ACORN, the controversial activist group currently under federal investigation for vote fraud. Another $750 million would be exclusively reserved for nonprofits such as ACORN  meaning cities and states are barred from receiving that money. Sen.

He was talking about like building road projects and things like that.  This bill has some of the typical pork that will not do that.  For one thing and this is a sore subject there is money for the national arts deal.  This thing has funded some really horror stuff and some good stuff, but it is not going to create a long term job.  So if a third of it is short term stuff, then that's 1.2 million jobs not supported.  this package must have done way ahead of schedule as they had to have known the Vegas odds on the election.    He should have consulted the other party leaders as they said they were not and given in on some of the stuff.  Seems he may do that, but instead of 825, then down to 819,now it's up to 888.  There are a ton of factors and there has been enough of the "rubberstamping' going on and it's time to jiin up and work it out.  The first bailout was done in haste as the "sky was falling" and probably the second will be not much different for accountability.  i would hope the President will make sure there is some accountability.    But as far as the jobs and stuff, it is sorta like the old "new deal" where the government created jobs, but they controlled the purse strings.  Here you have the old system of a company getting it and they may take the lion's share of money and pay very little to the workers.  lYou just don't know, but as far as the "fluff" money, not at this time.

It does not provide any stimulus for jobs, most will not kick in for over two years. Obvious pork includes aid for National Endowment for Arts, Aid to ACORN, Aid for STD's, Aid for Pell Grants, the lists are endless, these are liberal's getting their wish list fulfilled. Reality is it was the legislative branch that got us in this mess, encouraging lending to those who could not afford mortgages, deregulating securities industry and lack of oversight. The government now owns the major banks (bank america, citi, bear stears, countrywide, wachovia) and owns large hunks of goldman sachs, morgan stanley. It also owns AIG. Bailing these out companies was socialism, the government owns them. In the eighties, savings and loans failed through bad investments in junk bonds, when they failed the government set up the RTC (resolution trust corp) which took their assets and sold at auction. This is what we should have done, instead of letting Paulson (he was CEO of Goldman Sachs before he became treasury secretary) bail out his buddies. They now will not account for the money we gave them, and we are now going to give them more. Government does not need to be in these businesses, government has horrible time running itself as our govt, especially congress is so irresponible and corrupt, it is repulsive. Capitalsim can and must work, for it to work, congress must butt out, let the banks fail, others will replace them. Socialism has been tried in other parts of the world and failed miserably. When I was younger I thought it was a good idea, now that I am older I see the problems in socialism. The irony is that the rest of the world is leaning towards capitalism after having socialist types of government fail them, and our fearless leaders think they can sneak their grand spending plans through, calling it stimulus, and saying immediate action is necessary, where in reality, we need to take a look at what we are doing as the plans put forth today will ensure this country becomes a third world debtor nation............|`|x12mMdApaa	what, are you 12.|`|MEReSvZeaa	It doesn't address the real causes of the economic slow down:    --slow down in housing construction, the biggest cause of the loss of jobs  --withdrawal of foreign investments, the biggest cause of lack of capital for American companies, and another cause of loss of jobs  --low interest rates that help to force banks out of business if they can't make a profit  --corruption in the GSE's (mostly democratic--no way they'll police themselves)    Seriously, a 12-year-old could figure this out.  Spending money doesn't even touch any of these things.  It's clear that Obama and the dems in Congress have NO CLUE what they're doing, and to be fair, Bush dropped the ball.  He had the right idea with his original proposal, and he changed horses mid-stream.    ****************  What would I do?    Absolutely nothing.    The housing market will fix itself in the spring, and jobs will be created by the resuming of construction.    The banking industry will fix itself when the bad apples go bankrupt and are forced to sell the toxic assets without the government's help.    Toyota and Honda will pick up the pieces of the auto industry for pennies on the dollar and get rid of one of the most corrupt and costly unions in America.    Done deal.  We'll see economic growth in about 18 months.

I don't think you should blame Obama for the response to the ice storms.  It is not a lack of effort on the part of Obama, or more importantly, emergency crews, to resolve the situation.  It is the fact that the situation is really, really bad out there!  I think you are tempted to think that this is similar to Bush and Katrina, and it is, in the sense that things are really bad!  The only difference is that the media isn't shoving it down your throat 24/7 and trying to paint Obama in a bad light.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Where is FEMA?  Where are the free trailers?  Free cash cards?

We in Europe hear regularly about the tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths in Third World countries because of flood, famine, war or disease - and quite rightly so.  Not to hear about the millions of recent dead in USA can be only because of a news blackout - unlike the Louisiana flooding and Texas etc hurricanes where we received daily updates.    Very suspicious.|`|tdG5409Uaa	Well actually your not a good listener but a damn good speaker  but Obama launch millions of dollars left from Bushy administration to the ice storm and is still trying to figure out more he can do at ONE TIME which is impossible but i praise him for trying.

The war on drugs, the war on terrorism and the war on poverty.      They all sound like good things to go to war over...except that they are ill defined and there can literally never be an end to these "wars".  Therefore, use of these terms are overall a very negative thing in my opinion.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	It'll be interesting to see what he renames it.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Actually, it was Bush who first stopped using it as often...wanting to present a 'different' view on what he was doing. http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/politi...  "In recent speeches and news conferences, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the nation's senior military officer have spoken of "a global struggle against violent extremism" rather than "the global war on terror," which had been the catchphrase of choice. Administration officials say that phrase may have outlived its usefulness, because it focused attention solely, and incorrectly, on the military campaign.     Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the National Press Club on Monday that he had "objected to the use of the term 'war on terrorism' before, because if you call it a war, then you think of people in uniform as being the solution." He said the threat instead should be defined as violent extremists, with the recognition that "terror is the method they use."|`|MEReSvZeaa	Yes, it's wrong.  He's returning to the "Paper Tiger" diplomacy of the Clinton years that encouraged al Qaida to attack us.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	We do need to protect endangered catchphrases.|`|sUiUJWiSaa	"The War on Terror" was a phrase used to manipulate the public into a war with Iraq! If we were just after Bin Laden, we wouldn't have had the grounds to go into Iraq and gas would have never went to 4.00 a gallon, and the world would have never went into a recession, and Halliburton, Cheney, and Bush wouldn't have been quite as rich!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Yes, I agree. Words create our thoughts & thoughts create how we feel & feelings are E=energy in MOTION (emotion). This creates what we do & what we attract into our life. The words we use & the way we say things is so important. Of course a pig with lipstick is still a pig but some people will say the pig is so beautiful, intelligent & they may even think she is a good govenor without seeing her without the lipstick. Can you imagine how many votes this pig would get if she didn't wear lipstick. She would have none. In the case of the war on terror we were lied about it being so bad. The people who believe in terror actually terrorize themselves. So this can go one way or the other but the truth is important & in this case the truth is better expressed without putting fear in people but faith.|`|Uo5wYDklaa	It is completely right, because two things, america doesn't win war. war on drugs? dont make me laugh.    the term war on terror has no end, as there will always be terror and the term war makes people upset that we are dying.    but really i wish they would end the war on drugs and just admit that they lost.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	I don't care what he calls the war.  Recklessly closing Guantanamo bothers me a lot more than changing the name.|`|lWZi2p70aa	You don't launch a war on criminals--you deal with them day to day.  It is ridiculous for the government to assume war powers to fight a bunch of people engaged in criminal activity.    One might as well have declared war on the Mafia because they were out to undermine our economy by withdrawing great amounts of money from circulation.     Fortunately, most of the terrorists are not American Citizens, and in many cases their host countries would be as glad to see the end of them as we would be.    If the US were a dictatorship instead of a country of laws, we could have hired some folk and the terrorist leaders would have turned up dead while we were still sucking our thumbs over 9/11, and then we could have lamented the fact that the terrorists would never get their day in court.|`|m0muVAXfaa	Yes it is. When you acknowledge something in such a way it gives the tactics and people who use random violence credibility and creates a "side" to recruit to. I'm all for hunting them down and killing them, but let's do it like you would do rats, systematically and when the opportunity exists, and this will not lend any power to them. Bush created an image bigger than the problem, so the problem tried to grow to fit the image. I like reality based leadership rather than creating bogeymen to give bankrupt ideas credence.|`|AA11559902	YES i do agree!!!!!  the guy above me "liberty" took the words out of my mouth.  Abstract wars are nothing but propaganda.  And what do you think about it, J? :)|`|4d795bce25fa79078a906a2eaafc32adaa	This is just something the media is going to give Obama credit for, when Rumsfeld announced it several years ago, they didn't seem to care.

In my city, the people have to register with the city and they have certain places that these people can and cannot assemble for safety reasons.|`|ps5i5gQ1aa	That is why it is called FREEDOM of speech. if you limit what people can say then there is no longer freedom of speech. What if people decide they don't like what you say and you are no longer allowed to say it?    The only time speech should be hindered is when it results in a lack of public saftey like yelling fire in a crowded theater.    There is a movie called the American President with michael douglas. He made a quote about freedom of speech that hit it perfectly. He talked about how freedom of speech is defending speech you hate    Here is the quote    America isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say "You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then, you can stand up and sing about the "land of the free".    ADDITION: the difference between yelling fire in a theater or yelling bomb in an airport or talking about commiting terrorist activites is that those acts incite thing that affect public saftey. the church people are only stating their opinion. you just dont agree with it. Athiest do the same thing and have a right to do so, PETA has a right to stand on a corner and tell people eating meat is murder, but once they go farther by throwing stuff on people they are no longer just exercising free speech they are commiting assult.|`|zjpB2GARaa	You're referring to Westboro Baptist Church right?    Of course, they have the right to freedom of speech, provided that they remain on public property.  However, this is why we need to abolish public property and have everything be privately owned.  Nobody has a right to go onto somebody's property and speak in a manner in which the property owner disapproves.  Public property cannot and should not be restricted.  If the government is granted a "right" to ban the Westboro Baptist Church bigots from public property, what's to stop them from using this privilege to ban anti-war protesters, gay rights activists, opponents of anti-porn laws or other legitimate (but unpopular) groups from using public property for free speech?    In a tolerant and free society, people who wish to spew bigotry are allowed to do so, as long as they do not initiate violence (which includes violating the property rights of a legitimate private property owner).|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	"If we don't believe in freedom of expression for   people we despise, we don't believe in it at all."   -- Noam Chomsky    Lynn,    I don't like some of the things that YOU say.

DAMZKbpDaa	If the profit sharing bonus is an obligation (and, from the term "bonus," it probably isn't), then the easiest way is to contact your state's department of labor. If the company legitimately owes it to her, they will get it for her. No need for the expense of small claims court.    But, and consider this, that the bonus is a choice by management, whether to pay at all or how much, then going to the department of labor, or to small claims court, she would lose, because the company is not obligated.    And, she would be out the small claims court fee.|`|MEReSvZeaa	For that small amount, go straight to your boss and ask why.

Another Edit: Yes but a bonus isn't given to encourage employees to be loyal in the past, it ensures their loyalty in the future, if you work hard you will get rewarded, if you quit you get nothing. Your sister shouldn't complain she left a perfectly good job where they got bonuses, if she was so concerned about it she should have waited until after she got her bonus to quit.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	You can disagree with MLE all you want.....but she/he is right.

DAMZKbpDaa	She needs to document what he says and does, meaning writing it down as closely as possible to exact words, and times.    Then, she needs to complain to a manager (specifically, the manager or owner of the store over this manager) or if the company has a sexual harassment department. This is serious for the company. It is called sexual harassment, the worst kind, "quid pro quo."     If none of this works, she should talk to a lawyer. Many lawyers will have an initial consultation free, and some will take this on a contingency bases.

He may need to become more confrontational, though.  I'm not sure why he seeks to accommodate Republicans.  Those who are still in office are especially conservative and will never cooperate with him.  As they say, you can't make a wolf friendly by petting him.      I am hoping that he is trying to discredit them by offering to be inclusive and letting them prove themselves to be obstructionist.  The public will view him as reasonable and the Republicans as unreasonable.  There is a leadership vacuum among the Republicans right now.  By calling more attention to Rush Limbaugh, he might be trying to make someone unappealing to mainstream America the public face of the Republican Party.|`|t5hp4t79aa	This site often reminds me that conservatives have a warped sense of the world and their place in it....Obama probably won't be the best president of all time, but he's already proven to be 100x better than Bush. and He's the best option we had during the last election.   I mean, McCain, seriously. If he were in offfice we'd all be f**ked.

S3WeYrVgaa	They are to be mailed out by/on 1/31.  So if they send it out today they are covered.|`|AA12103453	Perhaps you should have read your booklet from the I.R.S., they have until Feb SECOND. As in MONDAY.    edit:People I have the 1040EZ filing instructions, from the I.R.S. and it specifically says the employer is required to provide or send the W-2 no later then Feb. 2 2009. It's likely because the 31st is a Saturday(providing an extra day because weekend). Personally I didn't mean my answer as a lecture or anything, it's just you can't get a lawsuit when they haven't broke the rules YET.|`|aqto0hJTaa	The law states that the W2s must be prepared and postmarked by 1/31.    You're SOL.  How were you going to get a return so fast anyway?|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Good luck with that one.....geez.      Its sounds like your problem is that you are chronically late paying or you owe back rent.   Whats your excuse for that.    Pick up your self esteem and develop some morals.    ETA:  Nope you do not have grounds for a lawsuit nor should you.....if anything they will get a warning if enough complaints are filed......if they are getting complaints every year then the company will get fined of which Nothing will end up in your pocket.  If an employee was intentionally interfering with it...then federal charges can be brought against the individual.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	Perhaps you should have saved everyone of your payroll stubs, than you would not be waiting on a w-2.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	Send them a demand letter and see what happens. I doubt you have any grounds for a lawsuit because it's not their fault your rent was late.|`|AA11349925	You should have had a better back up plan in place to pay your rent, sound like this isn't the first time you've been late.

If you do not recieve it by then, you can contact your employer.  If you still don't get it by the 15th of February, you can file a complaint with the IRS by calling them.  As far as your employer being responsible...no.  They are not the ones that got you in a legal lease with a landlord which resulted in you obviously overextending yourself financially.|`|AA12146958	You are responsible for your misfortune. You are the one who got behind on your rent. You are the one who got yourself into this mess. So no your employer is not resonsible or liable for your mistakes.|`|6r7ZkNMQaa	By Law, a W-2 must be postmarked no later than Jan 31st of the current year.  So 2008 W-2's should be sent by mail no later than Jan 31st of 2009.    yes it's always nice to have it earlier, but they are under no legal obligation to do so.

And for the childish people who are using his middle name as a weapon...    ...Is it our fault that the best that the Republican Party could produce for the past 8 years was:    1. A befuddled "C-" president whose father was the only reason that Yale put up with him.  The only way he could get to be president was by bribing his brother to throw away votes.  It wasn't bad enough that he lied to Americans, bullied his way to get the oil from other nations and humiliated the US on national TV with his stupidity...he also made sure that he took down the American economy, left us a huge national debt and sent thousands of Americans and Iraqis to their deaths in senseless wars to fill his blood-soaked Lex Luthor suit pockets.    2. A hockey mom whose "bridge to nowhere," her scandals, her bad family planning and her brain dead answers to questions with obvious answers sent her running with her tail between her legs back to Alaska.    3. A man who changed his beliefs to get the base of his party.  Not that he had much morals to begin with since he walked away from his injured wife after she waited YEARS for his return (he was the 2nd man to do this by the way) and he robbed the cradle on his way out taking a child (Cindy McCain) and turning her into his trophy wife.  If Obama hadn't stopped him cold, he'd have destroyed what's left of the economy and sent the rest of our jobs overseas.    4. Rudy Guiliani.  This man was racism in human form.  This monster sat by and watched as his uniformed thugs murdered black men in the streets, they tore into a black woman's apartment who called them to help stop a robbery and beat her until she had to be hospitalized then they had the nerve to chain her to the bed (happened before Sean Bell trial), his idea of fighting crime was oppressing minorities and he had no problem watching Pataki send cops to hose down kids who were protesting budget cuts.

What happened in Rwanda? Genocide committed by black african troops and black leaders.

Some blatant racist in Europe consider the Obama election to be an blip in political history of white leadership . . . which really just goes to show that racism is still in existence everywhere not just in the United States.      Even more racist are the comments by a Polish member of Parliament who called the American election of a black leader:     "the end of the white man's civilization." He added: "America will soon pay a high price for this quirk of democracy."    Hatred crosses all borders.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Um, because there are still MANY racist people in the United States.

Think harder nest time.|`|N5jBMjrDaa	Klaus Emmerich needs to STFU.|`|t5hp4t79aa	Racism exists in diff forms depending on the society you live in. Europe is racist economically. The U.S. is racist socially. Basically in Europe people date, marry, and socialize outside their race, but try to lock out immigrants, minorities, etc. when it comes to the good jobs. In the U.S. it's the exact opposite.   Another diff between the two regions: in Europe your nationality comes before your race, that is, if you're French and black, you're seen as French in general. In north America, if you're half asian born here in the States you're seen as asian first, American second. Nationality barely comes into play at all here.....|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No idea, thats really ironic though because no other influential countries have elected minorities into their highest levels of governments...next time a Euro says that tell him to STFU|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Who cares what the European Liberals think..they are nobodys|`|oubC3TCOaa	Because European are all nudists.

McCain was duped in to this role and one day we will learn what promises were made to him for doing so.|`|9VaWal2Daa	it was a fluke the republicans were actually able to run a candidate at all.     They were lucky to have McCain......someone they themselves label a closet democrat.     Obama's win was no fluke.  It was the answer to George Bish's question........."Can ya hear me now?"    Yup.......we heard him.......and Obama is our answer.     I wonder if BUSH can hear us now?|`|6oASoFr7aa	I like Cynthia's answer because if you remember all those black florida district congressmen and women who wanted an investigation into the 16000 black voters who were disinfranchised in the 2000 election, not one senator would come to the aid of the black community, not even senator who I loved so much. Obama's victory was almost like bitter sweet revenge for all the injustice of the Bush administration, and even though I don't believe in abortion under no circumstances  I've always been on the side of the democrats since I was old enough to vote. (that was my first time voting in the 1st Bush election) because I believe in a humane society, I was brought up a christian, but as I got older I saw that many of there ways were unreasonable, such as this all out war on gay marriage. I myself think that some gays are too flamboyant and just annoying, I don't see anything kinky about a man gettin boink in the booty or any of that other sh**t, I think they she should be allowed to get married though because I think it would cut down on the number of men in the closet, ppl doing drugs and the h.i.v , or so called h.i.v,  epidemic(i'm still on the fence about that and will probably post something on it in the future because I have compelling evidence that somethings not right about this), i think it would also boost the overall well being of the economy. When ever you have an oppressed person in your circle (society) thats a person will low morale. Anyway the reason I was saying all this is because, I think that if Obama can bring us into a more humane society, than no this wont be a fluke.

The Country hated Bush and all Republicans that much.|`|gRfqjemmaa	No, it was not a fluke. It was well planned. Obamas machine was well planned, some say corrupt, ACORN for instance. They are under investigation for voter fraud in many states. Obama also took a lot of money from some skeptical sources. He ended up with $600,000,000 to John McCains $40,000,000. He also had a lot of help from the Liberal Media, schools, Hollywood, etc.  Moveon.org was also a factor.|`|9kx7KDFLaa	Heck No, he won fair  come on now let's move on|`|AA10317675	No    McCain was not dynamic.

ehjKpv0Waa	actually there is a cap on the benefits(the money payment) allowed to receive.  some states cap children in 1996,  meaning,  having additional babies cannont get more benefits.  they are allowed to get more food staps, though.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	So you think the government should determine who people have children with?    I prefer freedom myself.|`|vwqjG9vfaa	We should stop welfare.  It just teaches people to sit at home, have illegitimate babies, watch soaps, and go to the mailbox and pick up the free money and food from the government.  The whole system SUCKS|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Sad but true. Bet then again how else can they get a raise.    Have sex, get pregnant, get a raise. WOW, What a country!!!|`|eulMjLtPaa	Penalizing a woman for having additional children would, of course, be penalizing the children.  I see no benefit  in that.      You are aware, of course, that each child adds about $70 per MONTH to the TARP money?  And that families have a four- or five-year time limit that they can receive assistance?      And as far as the "full range of reproductive rights," you are aware that in some states, there is ONE family planning clinic to aid in birth control information and supplies?  ONE.      And you are aware that family assistance programs are less than 15% of the federal budget?      I'm just sayin...|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Um, you should read up on state laws. FIRST, social security has nothing to do with the 'social welfare' system. Those are two different programs.   Second, contrary to your belief, welfare doesn't pay out more money for more children. After the 3rd child, the payment is still the same in nearly every state. Further, the average family on welfare have 1.5 children, not numerous children. Welfare is not for poor mothers, but for impoverished children. Since SOME people demand that these children be born, it is only right that we care for these kids and make sure that they have enough food and basic medical care. Medicaid doesn't cover contraceptives, so most women have not been given a 'full range of reproductive rights'....as they would have to pay out of pocket for contraceptives. Finally, you should also educate yourself about applying for social welfare. A single mother must first apply to the courts for child support BEFORE DHEC will allow her to access the program. IF and ONLY if the father is unable to pay for his child or unable to pay enough for his child is the benefit granted....for the child, not the mother.|`|AA10726404	Sorry, I stopped reading after I saw the word 'wedlock.'  Get back in your time machine and head back to 1950.    Anyone who thinks that women deliberately have lots of kids as some kind of money making scheme, are just ignorant of reality.    The American welfare system is certainly not a free ride.  It is barely enough money to not be homeless.|`|TKbYavhzaa	What about legitimate births?  Most adults on benefits are married.|`|vIO2jWu9aa	the government doesn't care about the marital status or citizenship of the mother that is popping out kids. What really pisses me off are the illegal alien criminals that hop over the border & pop out a kid so that the kid is a US citizen. THAT is wrong!

And KIND-OF-LIES-A-LOT Rice is a JOKE!!!!!!!!! What did she accomplish in her 4 years? Besides NOTHING!!!    BTW, Thurgood Marshal was appointed by Johnson, a Democrat. The difference between Marshall and Clarence UNCLE Thomas?    Thurgood Marshall actually asked questions during cases that were brought before the Surpreme Court. He was an active member in court proceedings, and wrote some of the Greatest Opinions ever written.    UNCLE Thomas hasn't asked a question during court proceedings in over 4 years. The stupid a$$ admitted that on 60 Minutes. He just sits there, letting his white masters ask questions, probably playing with his "big thing," because his masters are going to tell him how to vote any way. He hasn't written an opinion in over 6 years, he just sits there.|`|m0muVAXfaa	Seems like there is one or two, but I can not think of who they are. A rare bird indeed.

The "Out of Context" argument is an easily refuted one.    How out of context, did one take it?    If I read to you a sentence, you'll say I took it out of context and demand a paragraph.    If I read you a paragraph, you'll say I took it out of context and demand a chapter.    If I read you a chapter, you'll say I took it out of context and demand the whole book.    If I read you the whole book, you'll say the book itself is out of context and not in accord with the subject at hand.      No matter how much I zoom out so to speak, someone will always accuse me of taking something out of context.    That's just how it works.    So although annoying (the same psychology as Why?  Why?  Why? Questions from a child). It solves nothing.    It's a weak argument meant to try and shut one down any claim you may make through your own irritation.      It's not even an argument really, it's a wild swing in the dark by a desperate opponent who knows he or she has been beaten and cannot counter anything you said.    So in conclusion-the whole "You've taken it out of context." is the adult equivalent of "Why? Why? Why...?"    In any case, Rush Limbaugh is a well-known fool who should think twice before he speaks from now on.

0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	Coming from a conservative. I went through this situation. I have a child with my ex-wife. I pay her more than half my check in child support, while I have barely enough to live. She spends my money on plastic surgery and tummy tucks, and her expensive car with rims.    I can hardly afford to see my son, because I cant afford the gas and tolls because she lives so far away. The courts are in it for the money, so they could care less.    I love my son, but I could not "afford" to have another with my new fiance. Not that I dont want to, but the courts put us "men" in a situation of JAIL or no kids..

She needed to forget that ever happened, and I'm not sure her mental health could have tolerated finishing that pregnancy, even if the child ended up being mine.    It was a tough decision, but she decided she wanted to abort the pregnancy.    At any rate, don't assume that all abortions are performed because of selfishness or irresponsibility.

But, there are problems with that as well. Visit this site any hour of the day and you will hear repeatedly the NASTY names that these women and their children are called. It makes it difficult to be repeatedly called names for actually wanting to provide for you child. Some women don't have support from their families, their friends, the father. Some women are raped or abused, and bringing a child into that life would be detrimental to the child. There are a variety of reasons.....but for whatever reason, abortion should be a choice provided to them. Unfortunately, adoptive parents don't even cover the 3 million living kids we already have in the system, much less the infants being born. While there is a wait list for healthy white infants, there is no such wait for AA and Hispanic children. You will see a correlation.....as most of the women who have abortions in this country are also single, poor, young, minorities, and undereducated.

There is no way that an authentic Muslim prophecy would predict the wiping out of Israel. Its a strange thing that us Americans are, for the most part, ignorant to the fact that the "country" of "Israel" has only been around since the mid-1900s, much to late to be noted in an ancient prophecy.    We misinterpret the Arab worlds need to "force Israel into the sea," or however they say it, as some sort of anti-Semitic war cry; when in fact the Arab nations are only expressing the fact that, under the international law that all other countries have to adhere to, Israel has no right to be a country.     To put it very simply, in the 1960s a group of Zionist Jews living the middle east decided it was their "god given right" to form a land of their own. (remember manifest destiny?) This would-be noble goal, except it ignored that fact that most all of the middle easy was already heavily populated and civilized. They colonized a part of what used to be Palestine, and over the past 60 years have quickly taken over most of that country! They moved the Palestinians into  the horrendously overpopulated refugee camps(modern day ghettos!), most notably the the Gaza Strip/West Bank.   The Palestinians who are fortunate/unfortunate enough to live within "Israel" enjoy the benefits of enormous the American aid sent to "Israel," but are politically and socially repressed.    Think of it this way (again, oversimplifying) if the canadian religious leaders made the bible (lets pretend its a different bible in canada) to say that all of the East-Coast of America was designated as a "Zion" for Canadians and then waged a war, lets say funded by China, with the united states, killing millions and forcing us all to live in Delaware, with little water and electricity, no education, no trade, and no travel... WHAT WOULD THE WEST COAST DO? It would make it its top priority to destroy the Canadian government and all the canadians on american land and get its territory back! Would this be that wrong, i would argue "not really". Its kind of the cost of being a colonizer.    BUT DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! i would advise you,  and everyone who thinks that the Arab nations are wrong in their call for the destruction of the country of Israel to take a look at the history of "Israel." And don't worry, its not too long of a read, the country is only 60 years old =D.    But its a very dynamic situation and probably has no easy answer. Can you really blame the Jewish people for wanting what the Catholics have in 'the Vatican." But the Vatican wasn't really established by murdering and displacing millions Italians?    -Shamar    P.S. To Chris S: I would totally admit that my logic is by no means perfect. This is an extraordinarily complicated manner and i am simply presenting what i think of the current handling of it. But you are saying that the Israelis are "entitled" to the nation because the Torah says so (totally irrelevant to me, personally. My bible could say i own your house, that my god gave it to me, but you wont find me at your doorstep.) AND (perhaps much more relevantly) because "Land of Israel" was taken over in the 7th-century, and they simply want it back. But, by this logic, that ancient civilizations are entitled to their original land, it would be reasonable for you that the Indigenous people of northern America kill us Americans and reclaim their land (i would agree with that, but would you?) OR that a group of self-proclaimed Romans reclaim the area of the Roman Empire as it was in AD 117. What about the Ottomans  taking back the Ottoman Empire. HOW ABOUT the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Sassanians, and Byzantines? When do they get theirs?|`|F0uLexezaa	listen to this woman's story and you be the judge:    http://multimedia.heritage.org/content/w...|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Probably. I'd like to respond to "whatitdoshamar" and his ridiculous comments. First, Israel existed over two thousand years ago, long before Islam was invented. Israel was re-established by the UN in 1948, so- so much for your theory about zionist jews in the 60's. It does have a right to exist, and is NOT in violation of any international law by existing. And the only civility in the middle east in the 20th century was due to being under British control. When the Brits walked away, it reverted back into the primitive cesspool that still encompasses much of it today.   Where do you hear this crap, a mosque?|`|DiDCG9UBaa	It's already been formed.

They claimed their spot of land, and in this, THEIR OWN COUNTRY SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE...  to where it created some harsh environments for some of the Palestinians that were settled in there, as conditions got worse, trying to fight and get the Israeli's back out, more and more degrading conditions arose, dissension grew...of which war is also broken out. Yes, to defend their ground, they have a 'no holds barred' attitude, you know the violence incurred by the Palestinians/or Arab ancestry to begin with...Both "tribes" have been fighting for over a thousand( approx. - 2,000-) years now...

The U.S. has fringe groups as well who would like to destroy Israel, so does Germany, and a host of other countries....    The Arab, Persian, and north African governments won't want to disrupt the peace in the region beucase they are all happily making money. Rich people will be rich people, no matter where they are in the world. Its not profitable to destroy Israel, so why would they do it. If anything they will spend the money fighting the groups who want Israel destroyed, becuase these groups also want to end their own state's government and ruling classes as well......

Manis is associate professor of history at Macon State College in Georgia and wrote this for an editorial in the Macon Telegraph.         Andrew M. Manis: When Are WE Going to Get Over It?    For much of the last forty years, ever since America "fixed" its race problem in the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, we white people have been impatient with African Americans who continued to blame race for their difficulties. Often we have heard whites ask, "When are African Americans finally going to get over it? Now I want to ask: "When are we White Americans going to get over our ridiculous obsession with skin color?    Recent reports that "Election Spurs Hundreds' of Race Threats, Crimes" should frighten and infuriate every one of us. Having grown up in "Bombingham," Alabama in the 1960s, I remember overhearing an avalanche of comments about what many white classmates and their parents wanted to do to John and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Eventually, as you may recall, in all three cases, someone decided to do more than "talk the talk."    Since our recent presidential election, to our eternal shame we are once again hearing the same reprehensible talk I remember from my boyhood.    We white people have controlled political life in the disunited colonies and United States for some 400 years on this continent. Conservative whites have been in power 28 of the last 40 years. Even during the eight Clinton years, conservatives in Congress blocked most of his agenda and pulled him to the right. Yet never in that period did I read any headlines suggesting that anyone was calling for the assassinations of presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, or either of the Bushes. Criticize them, yes. Call for their impeachment, perhaps. But there were no bounties on their heads. And even when someone did try to kill Ronald Reagan, the perpetrator was non-political mental case who wanted merely to impress Jody Foster.    But elect a liberal who happens to be Black and we're back in the sixties again. At this point in our history, we should be proud that we've proven what conservatives are always saying -- that in America anything is possible, EVEN electing a black man as president. But instead we now hear that school children from Maine to California are talking about wanting to "assassinate Obama."    Fighting the urge to throw up, I can only ask, "How long?" How long before we white people realize we can't make our nation, much less the whole world, look like us? How long until we white people can - once and for all - get over this hell-conceived preoccupation with skin color? How long until we white people get over the demonic conviction that white skin makes us superior? How long before we white people get over our bitter resentments about being demoted to the status of equality with non-whites?    How long before we get over our expectations that we should be at the head of the line merely because of our white skin? How long until we white people end our silence and call out our peers when they share the latest racist jokes in the privacy of our white-only conversations?    I believe in free speech, but how long until we white people start making racist loudmouths as socially uncomfortable as we do flag burners? How long until we white people will stop insisting that blacks exercise personal responsibility, build strong families, educate themselves enough to edit the Harvard Law Review, and work hard enough to become President of the United States, only to threaten to assassinate them when they do?     How long before we starting "living out the true meaning" of our creeds, both civil and religious, that all men and women are created equal and that "red and yellow, black and white" all are precious in God's sight?    Until this past November 4, I didn't believe this country would ever elect an African American to the presidency. I still don't believe I'll live long enough to see us white people get over our racism problem. But here's my three-point plan: First, everyday that Barack Obama lives in the White House that Black Slaves Built, I'm going to pray that God (and the Secret Service) will protect him and his family from us white people.    Second, I'm going to report to the FBI any white person I overhear saying, in seriousness or in jest, anything of a threatening nature about President Obama. Third, I'm going to pray to live long enough to see America surprise the world once again, when white people can "in spirit and in truth" sing of our damnable color prejudice, "We HAVE overcome."    **************************************    It takes a Village to protect our President!!!|`|efg6683aaa	i think he hasn't made any wise choices YET.  the closing of the prison will bring controversy, as where the inmates will go, and what will happen to the base.  his economic stimulus package is ok in my opinion.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Right here.  He plans on closing one prison, not prisons.  And the one he plans to close, needs closing.  I think it's pretty dumb that people think he is just going to release these people on our streets.

His ideas for running this country are  in no shape or form  "DUMB: as YOU  see them   these so called ideas are promises that he mapped out for the people of America that he promised to deliver if elected President,, It is these very same  ideas  he is .now delivering as promised  Wow a President we can finally believe in~|`|OYWKu6ouaa	I agree with you.  Once Club Gitmo is closed, people who are suspected of terrorist activity against the United States, will have the same rights as United States citizens.  Some one said that the prisoners could be moved to Alcatraz, but that doesn't seem right either.  Why would we want our enemies in our country?  These people will want nothing more than to escape from prison, and when they do they will be on U.S. soil.  Not a good idea at all, and I for one, don't want my tax money to go towards abortion.  He also wants to reinstate the Fairness Act, which in my opinion is removing our constitutional right, of freedom of speech.|`|haXKbqwRaa	Obviously enough people to elect him as President.

8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	You need to take this matter back into family court and enforce the current court order because things don't seem to be working out as they should. Both of you are to decided on everything together not just one parent..the only way you can resolve this, is taking it back to court..you can also request'''court ordered mediation services' for making a planning plan together if you think that will work out..detailed account of each parties responsibiliities and expectations are on paper as a court order that must be followed..|`|85jy4Mt0aa	Court hearings are adversarial.  That means that the litigants are enemies.  This may be against your best interest and against the best interests of the child.    If possible, use mediation.  Find a mediation service in your community.  Sometimes the state bar association will have a list.    Ask your ex to participate.    It is much less expensive than a continuation of the lawsuit and usually heals the divisiveness that you are experiencing now.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Both of these actions should be referred back to the court. I do not know what other specific arrangements were made for custody and as the first nominated legal guardian, but I would certainly get that sorted ASAP.     Getting a child baptized is a very important decision, one which has serious consequences for the child's future, such a schooling, life philosophy, character, etc. ?who are the God parents', why were you not included. This is very very serious. Get this sorted for the child's sake.    Re the hair cut that is abuse if the child did not want her hair cut, and it was against her will.    ? will body piecing be next (in some countries) Catholics usually get   their ears pierced - I hope this would not be done to a child until they were 16 yo and had the choice.

UAHjJpC0aa	as an Independent  that had high hopes for Obama  I'm not very happy about his appointing tax cheats to his cabinet.

Obama is still continuing the road to spending trillions of dollars giving it to the banks - special interests and pork.    If the Country is in the toilet and 5 million people are losing their homes - Why not just spend 525 million dollars and give each person over 18 150 thousand dollars and allow us to stimulate the economy and get out of debt.     This so called trillion dollar bail out is not going to help the ones who are in trouble. The AMERICAN CITIZEN.    If the American people received the money and paid up their mortgages or paid them off the banks would be in great shape. Whey do you think they are doing it backwards, because it is a plan to destroy the economy even more and screw us.|`|mqOC4glfaa	As the President of the United States I think I am doing a fine job so far.

He's working on recovering the economy while trying to remove the crap like Gitmo, etc.    Gee, I wonder.    (Anyone who hates Obama is probably a bigot.  Dead serious.)|`|AA10818613	He's doing great for only being on the job for 2 weeks.  He's already reversed some god aweful Bush executive orders.  He's got some great appointments for the job compared to what Bush had, and he's working hard on the economy and trying to get the U.S involved in the world again with diplomacy rather than unilaterally.  The only thing I completely disagree with him on is how he is going to carry out the war in Afghanistan.  I really hope he does more politically in Afghanistan than militarily otherwise we are going to have another Viet Nam on our hands.  Instead of the being bogged down in the big muddy (viet nam) we'll be bogged down in big quick sand.|`|AA10168935	He's doing fine. He's reversed some awful decisions by Bush and has been working on a stimulus package to help us all.|`|7ULI2TnQaa	he just freakin started|`|9FHoZOTGaa	Earns and F+ from me.    Why?

Recklessly closing Guantanamo is simply ridiculous and will not end well  He makes no effort to conceal his hypocrisy nominating lobbyists immediately after saying he never would and turning up his thermostat to a level where coats are uncomfortable despite telling Americans to keep theirs well below 72 degrees.  His administration is already tainted with scandal  He forced through a "stimulus package" which in fact is nothing but a bunch of wasteful unecessary spending  HIs first interview was with Al Arabya and only resulted in our enemies losing respect for us.    The only good thing he has done so far is bombing a nest of Jihadist vipers in Waziristan.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Oh man is he ever doing great!  Why already he's nominated three wonderful people to his cabinet.  You gotta admit that team of his really knows how to pick 'em.  Who woulda thunk that Richardson would have been under federal investigation and Geitner would be a tax cheat and now Tom Daschle is a tax cheat.  He got Nancy Pelosi to add a trillion dollars to the federal budget already.  We've surrendered the war on terror, we're letting our enemies know what our interrogation techniques are, North Korea is telling South Korea to go f themselves and Iran just flipped on overture by Obama off.  Yep, he's doing an excellent job.  Hooooooo rayyyy.|`|PTnPKurQaa	He is horrible, and always has been.

xqU1N1VBaa	it sucks having pi-ss-y neighbours but you gotta please them. yes they are being idiots instead of talking to you they run to the big guys.     yes your landlord can evict you because of noise. its better to get out of the place now since they have shown such rudeness to you.    once your lease is up get out. make sure the place is super clean so you can keep most if not all of your damage deposit.    what you may consider not a lot of noise others may feel is super crazy. they have the right to be comfy in their home and your son has the right to have fun in his.     I can understand why the people do not wish to talk to you because they really dont know you and would rather somebody else deal with it. its not always fun dealing with neighbours.    you can get a little machine that measures the decibles(sp) you will know then how loud you are being and really be able to get them to quiet down.    right now im saying once your lease is up look for another apartment you dont want to get into further problems with your neighbours and land lord.|`|EcuCO4LCaa	It doesn't matter if you owned a cannon that goes off at 6 pm every night and they knew about it, You are responsible to keep your child from disturbing the neighbors or anyone for that matter. They are just as much entitled to peace and quiet as your kid is entitled to be a kid. Go buy a house and let the kid run around all he wants. That will end your problem.
vPZ2ERjzaa	It was written just after the Civil War. It says, in a nutshell, that anyone who was a member of Congress or a southern state's government and also participated in the Civil War on behalf of the South could not serve in Congress unless 2/3 of each house agreed. To get 2/3 of the houses to agree would take a lot of begging and promising. The reconstruction amendments were designed to punish the South, and this was just one way they did so.
8dc5NMexaa	Sefton bequested his estate to Council.  Council holds legal title to the estate.  The workers hold equitable title as beneficiaries of the trust.  The legal title owner can convey good title by sale.  They must keep the sale's net proceeds in trust for the beneficiary workers.      To prevent or restrain a sale of the particular asset, the workers may argue in a legal forum that the trust had a duty to maintain the trust corpus in its present form, i.e. cottages, and to prevent waste.  If the trustees, the Council does not prevail in their argument, then they will be ordered to repair the cottage.  The terms of the testamentary bequest from Sefton to the Council will be controlling.|`|psnaJcvpaa	I always thought that the meaning of 'bequest' is the act of giving, leaving by will, or passing on to another. This means that whoever inherits something (money or property) are the beneficiary and  hold a legal title and can do what they please with it.I could be totally wrong.    I would assume that if Lord Sefton bequeathed his property to the Liverpool City Council,then they are the Beneficiaries.  It's a shame he didn't leave his estate directly to the workers of the park...|`|IgI2SNolaa	no.. its illegal    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=wSO9jTPFbW...|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	no you can't cause it's stilling.|`|ToztjpAsaa	You can, but you'd be breaking the law.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	they could argue that the money made from it is going to be used for the good of the people of Liverpool|`|7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	Depends on the exact wording of the original bequest.

Until you can come up with an alternate plan . . . . well . . it is real easy to criticize when you don't have a clue what will or will not happen than it is to come up with a solution.

He did not become President until 1/20/2009.  Since I cannot see into the future, I do not know if there will be a deficit or how much it could potentially be.|`|yprHJNHAaa	No, the Dems DID NOT have the majority from 2006 to 2008.  They did NOT have the 60 votes REQUIRED to overturn the veto of the republican president.  The Dems had their hand tied for two years with the minority republicans filibustering in excess of 93 times.  The republicans even filibustered their own bills because they want the American people to think the Dems did nothing.  Watching Congress is quite educational...    As to the deficit...that is fault of the last administration... two wars.  Tax cuts and wars are NEVER done at the same time!  If you looks at the deficit over the last 20 years...the repubs create it...and the Dems pay it down.  The republicans really don't like to pay their bills...|`|AA10928202	I can't fit the number into this space. But don't worry, no matter how much they tax and spend, and how far they force us into a depression, they will assure us it's all Bush's fault and the kool aid drinkers will smile and believe it.|`|FQyp3K8Naa	Unfortunately, deficit spending will increase until we can no longer borrow money from other nations.  Remember, this is a global recession and we are approaching a Depression level economy.  As long as special interests groups and lobbyist have money to affect political viewpoints, our economy will not recover.  Remember, the TARP actually was a GREAT bill, unfortunately wall street influenced the "powers that be" to give them the money instead of buying up troubled assets.  That is what the bill states and that is how it was suppose to be done.  Congress is our biggest enemy because they are not holding the Executive Branch responsible.  The Executive Branch is suppose to enforce the law.  It has done that of late.  Let's see if the Obama administration will do its duty.  Pay attention to the 2nd half of the TARP.  If anything other than buying up bad mortgages happens, then you can buckle down and prepare for a rough road to recovery.  Our economic problem is simpler than the government wants you to believe.    The only problem that truly exists is the failure of the banks and nothing else.  Job losses are a secondary issues as a result.  If the mortgages are bought up, banks get there money.  Once that happens, people keep there homes and the value of real estate stabilizes.  Now, the banks can lend money and business can begin to finance their operations.  That means that jobs can be created and life can resume as it did before.  It doesn't take much, but someone has to loose.  Corperate America doesn't want to loose, so they shifted the pain to us.  I have a bucket theory to explain all I just said.
XYTUAzzgaa	why do liberals want to kill human life when they'll travel thousands of miles to save an animal|`|x12mMdApaa	congratulations, you have won the dumbest question of the day award.You really think cows, chickens and pigs are the same as unborn children?|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Isn't is ironic that Dems don't let us decide what to do with our bodies?

I would personally never have an abortion but I have no room as well as any other person to tell a woman or man what to do with their body.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	It's like the feminist reform movement all over again. We have to fight just to get rights to decide what to do with our body.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	If you want to get into all that "it's her body let her do what she wants", then please explain how drugs, prostitution, suicide, etc is not legal then.

Pro-lifers see it as a matter of two lives. It's not THE WOMAN'S life that is being deliberately terminated, but another human life, the one that lives inside her.    I can't believe the mass ignorance about Republicans on display here. Abortion is NOT a Republican/Democrat issue. It's a human rights issue.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	DIsgusting that they find the taking of a innocent life abhorrent?  I think not.    I am all for choice.  You choose to have sex, you choose not to prevent pregnancy.  50,000,000 humans have died post Roe verse Wade.  It makes the Holocaust seem humane by comparison.       Socially consider what would have happened to our country with those 50 million new workers and tax payers.  Think of the creative potential lost.  The aborted child who might have grown up and found the cure for cancer, or the next creative artist to enthrall the world with their painting or music.       Besides we are rapidly getting to the point where the same baby can be saved if prematurely born, but at the same time it is perfectly legal to abort the child at the same stage of development.  Technology is bypassing the moral issues and abortion is going to have to be dealt with at some point in the near term future out of the practical impossibilities we are now facing in the medical field.      While I have participated in abortions to save the life of the mother it is always a tragic thing for all concerned.|`|ng7Zon0Haa	yes I do ,just because she is still in the womb and can't speak for herself and depends on her mother for her life and well-being,does not mean she wouldn't choose to live,so I agree with you, it's disturbing the way they don't consider her decision at all.|`|ERVib5gYaa	What I find disturbing is the way you liberals ridiculed Sarah Palin for hunting.. but it's okay to kill babies.

However, I think that some (a big stress on the word some) women should be more proactive in using contraception.  I am pro-choice because I believe that women should not have to carry a child due to incest or rape.  I don't believe it should be used as a form of birth control.  I only say this because I've seen it happen way too often.  I also believe that the government should stay out of people's reproductive rights.  Just because I believe that way does not mean that everyone else does.|`|PJBYzIq6aa	We all eat meat. Actually human beings weren't so smart if they wouldn't eat animals, did you know that?|`|gRfqjemmaa	Comparing a child in the womb to eating meat? How about this one, liberals believe it is OK to kill a child in the womb, but worry about us slapping a terrorist in Gitmo. Hmm.

I think I will stick with my conservative values, thanks.|`|juK9Xyxzaa	A women can still decide what she wants to do with her body.  It's called responsibility.  She doesn't HAVE to have sex and possibly have a baby.|`|yprHJNHAaa	Yes...and don't forget how they vote against Equal pay for equal work.  The Republicans are for the corporations...they want the American people to be subservient to the rich.|`|noo8vpvzaa	We don't eat babies    As for the 'Christian' thing...The bible says that man was given dominion over the animals...They provide FOOD (ever heard of the 'fishes and loaves'?)    There is a difference between humans and animals...Liberals have trouble understanding that, except when they make sure that it's illegal to abort an animal's baby, but not a human's    I don't care what a woman does with her body, if she wants to cut off her arm, she can do that as long as she doesn't go on disability and make the taxpayers provide for her because of her stupid decision (take responsibility for your own actions)...If she wants to take birth control, get her tubes tied, or keep her legs shut, I'm all for that, too...It's the BABY'S body that I don't believe someone should be able to rip apart because they were irresponsible or too stupid to use birth control.      Irresponsibility and stupidity cause abortions...The liberals believe that women have the right to be irresponsible and stupid...I disagree when it causes a death.|`|KrrXT6ocaa	so you must believe prostitution should be legal?  and all drugs should be legalized?    by your logic, its her body, her choice.

SD26Knvpaa	I believe as long as it's Okay with your parents you can.  Since you're under 18, you're not really allowed to do certain things without your parent's giving an okay, and signing for you. Same way you need to be over 18 to sign a contract, etc. And if you're planning on LIVING there by yourself, you have to be independent. You can't rely on your parent's income, money, etc. You have to be able to live on your own.  But if it's against your parent's will, you pretty much can't do that.

8Qxb7OZOaa	Only the arrest will show up.......unless you were under 18.    Just make up an excuse if they ask but usually companies don't.....new cop or over zealous cop and charges were not filed.   Don't give up free information about your case.      I believe employers can only ask you or hold against you "Convictions"....SIS dismisses the cases therefore NO conviction.

DTSUJe2oaa	A preliminary trial/hearing is to establish probable cause for a trial, you may be called by the prosecutor so that the judge can see if their is sufficient evidence to go to trial with but this type of hearing is not adversarial and will be a relaxed atmosphere.~  What to Expect at the Preliminary Hearing    In reaching this probable cause decision, the judge listens to arguments from the government (through a government attorney, or "prosecutor"), and from the defendant (usually through his or her attorney). The prosecutor may call witnesses to testify, and can introduce physical evidence in an effort to convince the judge that the case should go to trial. The defense usually cross-examines the government's witnesses and calls into question any other evidence presented against the defendant, seeking to convince the judge that the prosecutor's case is not strong enough, so that the case against the defendant must be dismissed before trial. ~

So you should check with a real lawyer and/or tennant rights group.      But you have an expectation of privacy in your home and dwelling.  Your landlord cannot come into your home on a whim, he/she must inform you of when and where.      So you can change your locks, but you cannot damage the doors.    So change them and when the landlord needs to get in -- either be there or change them back to his locks (which you will need to do) when you vacate the apartment.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	If the owner has said no - then yes, you have done something wrong. You must give 2 sets of new keys to the Agent.    You should have referred the reason for the need to change the lock through the Agent looking after the property for the owner.    The owner could suspend the lease, as you have breached the Lease by changing the locks or even claiming you have "damaged" his property against his/her express wishes.    The Agents and Landlord need keys at all times for Fire, access and property reviews.    I would get myself down to the Agents straight away and talk to them immediately.    Good Luck

In Cross you should try your best to do the opposite by asking leading questions that suggests an answer (Yes and No works perfectly). Therefore you can lead the witnesses answers and not give the witness leeway to disagree (See Link 2 Youtube).

DTSUJe2oaa	Adjudicative Process     The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors:    a. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;  c. The frequency and recency of the conduct;  d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  e. The voluntariness of participation;  f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;  g. The motivation for the conduct;  h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.    Each case must be judged on its own merits, and final determination remains the responsibility of the specific department or agency. Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.    The ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful consideration of the following, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person.    Although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally unstable behavior. Notwithstanding the whole person concept, pursuit of further investigation may be terminated by an appropriate adjudicative agency in the face of reliable, significant, disqualifying, adverse information.    When information of security concern becomes known about an individual who is currently eligible for access to classified information, the adjudicator should consider whether the person:    a. Voluntarily reported the information;  b. Was truthful and complete in responding to questions;  c. Sought assistance and followed professional guidance, where appropriate;  d. Resolved or appears likely to favorably resolve the security concern;  e. Has demonstrated positive changes in behavior and employment;  f. Should have his or her access temporarily suspended pending final adjudication of the information~
cfvAJJqdaa	The code needs changed then. That is the person's own fault.    People snoop, people gossip. It's life. Don't clog up the system trying to sue people over hurt feeling.     People don't need permission to snoop and it is not illegal unless it's unlawfully accessing something like medical records and even then nothing much is done. If I am in your house to fix your plumbing technically I can walk into your bedroom, go under your bed and read your diary and there is nothing you can do about it legally, only try to get me fired. Grow a pair, or be more careful in future.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Check with a 'employment lawyer' and check for work policies on this matter, if it is in the employee's handbook|`|85jy4Mt0aa	If an employee uses a company phone or computer system, the employer may monitor the content of the messages as well as other data, such as the persons, numbers, or addresses of persons contacted.    If you are using the company's system, there is no such thing as "personal".
4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Depends on the state.  In some states yes, in others no.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	"be with" meaning sex...no.  this would be statutory rape and could result in prison for the 18 year old. they call it rape because the law claims a 16 year old is not an adult and therefore cannot "consent" legally to having sex. this means the act act is non consensual which means rape. if you are just dating then that is fine|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Uh...hmm.    So this is how morons first get the idea in their head that they are in love and should run away with a guy who will promptly dump them a year or two later.    Well...that's...that's just special.|`|l3moIem5aa	*facepalm|`|ZzS46I0kaa	No, generally not legal unless parents go to court with you and have you emancipated.|`|vALEURm8aa	Yes its fine. As long as you have parental consent. But if you have sexual activity then it is illegal, but yes you can date.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	Depends on the state, but most states it is illegal.  I also would not advocate running away just to be with some guy/girl.  That could just make criminal charges worse.  Things always seem like they are awful at 16.  When you get a little older though, you realize how completely misguided that thinking was.      If someone older is advocating you run away with them that should be a big red flag something is wrong.  Someone who is truly mature would not expect that from you.

We don't need maniacs like you filing frivolous law suits and clogging up an already jam-packed court system.    If you want a good lawyer, you are going to have to pay.  Look forward to a retainer of at least $5,000, if you can actually find someone who will take on your joke of a case.    If you live in an employment-at-will state (and most states are employment-at-will) your boss can fire you for any darn reason they want to.  There are exceptions to the rule, of course.  They can't tell you it's because of your sex, religion, etc.    You don't have any hard evidence that proves your boss fired you and other employees because you voted for Obama.

56b2673c86699181557ab8de443fae51aa	It would depend on where you were in the courtroom and why you are there.    If you are in the general seating waiting on a case to be heard you normally can simple stand up quietly and exit the courtroom to the restrooms and return quietly when done.    If you are in the jury box you may have a longer wait. If it gets too bad simple let the jury foreman know and it is his/her job to let the the proper person know so that the judge can call for a break.     If you are a defendant or plaintiff in the middle of a trial just let your attorney know and he will as for a break.    Most of the time there is enough down time in courtrooms that getting a restroom break is not a big deal at all. Just watch what others are doing around you and quietly follow their lead but make sure someone knows where you went if they call you for some reason.    http://www.tjconnerassociates.com|`|wC51rE1gaa	thats why the courts smell funny!!|`|K7x1RHVFaa	Yep. You get the attention of the judge or the bailiff and the bailiff tells the judge that a recess is necessary and the jury is taken out first and told not to talk about the case, then the defendent is taken out with the bailiffs as the judge goes to chambers and the lawyers can go next, but yes, hold up your hand is the answer.|`|rnZoebKQaa	everyone gets a diaper before court is in session|`|RgblqqxIaa	You ask the judge|`|RTBuK59Daa	Yes, ask the Judge.

Hxttt7G0aa	Nothing, they are both used wrongly by democrats because neither really represent what the democrats do or think.    I'm Liberal mostly ... but the democrats just SUCK! The democrats are such a bunch of corrupt fascist destructive scum, that I could never vote for them.    Cutting taxes IS progressive.    Supporting MLKs dream that color be no issue at all, IS progressive.     Proactively protecting the country, and not just waiting inside the borders and covering our eyes to the rest of the world IS progressive.    A free market economy IS progressive.    Holding your own party members accountable and prosecuting them and getting rid of them when they screw up like Republicans do, but Democrats DON'T ... IS PROGRESSIVE    What democrats do most of the time IS REGRESSIVE, and DAMAGING to the country.    Democrats ARE the party of the super rich elites.    Democrats ARE the party of group thinking brain washed FASCISM.|`|cIPziIdnaa	A progressive is just a liberal embarrassed by the label.|`|E0dl34Y7aa	A Progressive is someone who plans for the long term future and puts a strong foundation in place for the future today so things get "progressively" better as time goes by.    The REPUBLICANS call anyone who spends money a "liberal" and by that measure Bush was the greatest liberal of all time who took a $10T surplus and made it into a $10T debt AND destroyed the economy all at the same time ON PURPOSE.    The real definition of a liberal is someone who doesn't want government telling them what to do and usually puts a strong emphasis on people helping people which of course is the opposite of republican greed doctrine so naturally republicans hate liberals just as much as God hates republicans.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	The terms are usually interchangeable.|`|FrfdKKGWaa	nothing|`|saQHPbBHaa	Progressives push harder for changes.|`|d1e15f9b89d78bbda3eeae41704b045faa	A progressive is a hell of a lot smarter.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	None.|`|sTSBk9jhaa	During the early 1980's when Ronald Reagan got in to office, he did such a good job pushing his points discrediting the liberal agenda that the word liberal became a dirty word in politics.

Roads & bridges aren't going to bring us back money. A kid who gets an education from the money & then he/she invents something great could help. The economists & Obama know this. It would take 2012 just to get normal. We are just consumers now that if the money that is spent for something productive in the future so they are figuring out now what the best way to get a return would be. So they are looking for money to come back from research & the private sector but the jobs alone are not going to do it.

Bad news to have the same judge in the same court. The judge gave him a chance the first time around. So probation will be unlikely this time around. Maybe if he agrees to anger management classes or something.     The court not necessarilly need you there to prosecute as you already made a statement and there will be the officer's testimony. Since this is the second time and a child is about he may continue the case until you show.     This can happen because he could have threatened you into not showing. It is domestic violence after all.     The "I can beat the state" attitude does not bode well for his future. His bet bet would be to just fess up and throw himself to the mercy of the court.    I won't lecture you either. But you know what you should do.    On the upside if you ever have to do the whole custody thing his two charges would help you.
1b771d8c5ecb7cf9ea18297c6a0bf6f7aa	My goodness, everyone is so negative. Here's some real advice that might actually help...    Continue to do well in school, obviously, and don't do anything that may come back to haunt you someday (like trying drugs, underage drinking, premarital sex, etc). and distance yourself from those who do things like that. Image is everything.    While in high school, focus on government, economics, history and speech communications. Run for student government. Join a young republicans/democrats club. Join the debate team. Practice debating the issues with your friends and family.    Join (or start) some organizations to help your community. Regularly volunteer to help the poor. Pick a local issue you feel strongly about and get a campaign going to change it. Get involved in local government by volunteering during campaigns and elections, and learning all you can from those involved. Join an effort to register new voters.    No matter what you do, keep track of anything and everything so you have proof of all your experience.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	take the LOW road.

SGyRIjCIaa	It's a pretty neat concept. The less you do, the more you get. And the more you do, the less you get! Very logical and much better than telling people to suck it up and take care of themselves. Rich people become rich for a reason just like poor people are poor for a reason. It shouldn't take a rocket scientist to wrap your head around that. But if anyone were to actually say that they would be called a racist or sexist or something along those lines. It's the game of the democratic party. They win the people who have nothing just by offering them something.    "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." -Chinese Proverb    --EDIT---Chia Pet Biden: Don't listen to Love Canada. They can't even spell spoiled. And they love Canada a Socialist country. They could never understand what you are trying to say.     And to everyone who says "some are disabled or mentally ill and what not" 1.) That is a small percentage. 2.) That still should not limit them. Affirmative Action protects against the disabled from getting discriminated just as it does with people of different races or gender. I qualify for SSI for mental illness and I have LD but I don't take the handouts nor do I let it get in the way of succeeding. I go to school but I live at home and commute because I can't afford a big school. I drive a car from 1997 not an SUV.

Those in power live off the sweat of others' brows, while those without power are robbed of a just return for their work. Usury (the charging of interest above administrative costs) is a major contributor to the wrongdoing intrinsic to this system. We note, especially, how the world debt crisis leads poor countries into greater deprivation and a dependency from which there is no foreseeable escape. Here at home, the number of hungry and homeless and unemployed people rises in the midst of increasing affluence.    In labor, human need is no longer the reason for human work. Instead, the unbridled expansion of technology, necessary to capitalism and viewed as 'progress,' holds sway. Jobs are concentrated in productivity and administration for a "high-tech", war-related, consumer society of disposable goods, so that laborers are trapped in work that does not contribute to human welfare.     Furthermore, as jobs become more specialized, many people are excluded from meaningful work or are alienated from the products of their labor. Even in farming, agribusiness has replaced agriculture, and, in all areas, moral restraints are run over roughshod, and a disregard for the laws of nature now threatens the very planet.|`|k6hicodfaa	And you know this because?

zj91sSsuaa	You have to love Roe v Wade and how people misinterpret its decision.  The winning argument was that, for her to carry the baby to full term would cause her mental distress, therefore she should be granted an abortion without the Governments consent or acknowledgement, meaning they didnt have the right to ask her why she was getting one, only that her and the doctor felt it would be a good decision for her state of mind.    It was a medical decision and the government has no right to ask you about it.  For those of you that still dont GET IT.  Lets say you wish for a tubular litigation (tubes tied).  Do you think the Government should know about it?  How about a vasectomy?  Do you think you should let the government know you are getting one?  Its none of their business.  But see heres the tricky part that no one got.  You are not dealing with one life, you can argue when life truly begins all you want, but the fact is it will be a child; its already on its way to become human, there for it does have rights.  Now theres more to this, but I dont want to get into it, just take our word for it, it is a human being with rights.  So now that you understand that another life is involved, you have to weigh your options.  Is carrying a baby to full term, going to cause you physical or psychological health problems?  None of the women going to the abortion clinics today get a psychological evaluation to determine that.  NONE.  Well our Government (god bless them) seen this is going to be a problem.  So they decided that under these conditions; rape, incest and medical complications were acceptable to have an abortion.   It was the governments understanding that people would consult their doctors before having an abortion, and if he/she (Dr.) was true to his/her word to Do no harm then the court of the people wouldnt have a problem with it.  But No, you all had to manipulate the decision and the ONLY Dr. you consult is the one giving you the abortion.  Now I would rewrite the law to be fair; I think all women should see two Doctors, a psychologist, because a medical doctor would be ill qualified to determine if it would cause her psychological trauma.   And of course, your medical Doctor to see if any physical problems may occur.     Now you all think Im some goody two shoes republican religious nut, well Im not.  I want them to have abortions, for my own selfish reasons.

Nor does your landlord, as wrongly stated above, have to give you any sort of 30 day notice.    Of course, the process of eviction can take several weeks at least.  So, if you didn't move out, by the time the landlord was able to enforce his rights, take you to court and then get the Sheriff to evict you, it would be several weeks later and you would have moved out on your own.    You'll end up paying at least an extra month's rent, the landlord's legal fees and court costs, but you'll have a place to live.

AA12316826	I hate to break it to you but some would say WW III already started in 1996. Read the 1997 book "Bible Code" by Michael Drosnin. It totally freaked me out. It is a real skinny book. A tad bit repetitive. You can get through it real fast: a real fast read. Can you say, "Where can I get suntan lotion with SPF 3,000,000,000?"    Note: I remember my third grade English teacher. She was a tough one. She said, "Son, listen, if you have more than ONE spelling error, type-o, or grammar error in your writing it makes you look like an idiot. Who can ever take your argument seriously? I mean you bring this paper up to me with all these errors. Look you spelled "receive" wrong. There is a split infinitive, double negative, comma splice, improper verb noun agreement. If you do not fix these errors I am going to have to give this paper a failing grade. Do you not know how silly this makes you sound?" I remember that lady to this day. She hurt my feelings but she was correct. Every time I see bad writing I think of her.    I am not saying that YOUR writing is bad. I am only saying that as I go here or go there while I happen to see bad writing in general I always think of her.|`|AA11305574	I agree with those who say it has already begun. The final act will be determined by whether Iran gets nukes, because they are crazy enough to use them and then the Shii-te is going to hit the fan.|`|AA11748691	WW III, in the true sense, began April 27, 2007, nine days after the declaration of war by the Iranians and less than 48 hours after their long-feared Islamic bomb exploded eight kilometers northwest of Hebron in the West Bank, obviously not its intended target. Casualties, mostly Palestinian, had been estimated to be between 30,000 and 35,000 killed and another 70,000 injured.    At that time, Israel launched six Gabriel 3 missiles tipped with 100 kiloton warheads, striking four of Iran's nuclear facilities, the launch base for their Shahab 4  IRBM and the high command's bunker outside Tehran. The sixth nuclear warhead was a deep penetrating bunker buster.    With the Israeli retaliation, the entire Arab/Muslim world went insane. Arab armies from Syria, Egypt, Jordan, West Iraq and Sudan mobilized against Israel. After 10 days of bitter fighting, they sued for peace. The Israelis, having shown the world their nuclear capability, made a direct appeal to Saudi Arabia to urge the Arab combatants to withdraw. The bargaining chip played by Israel? Stop the attack on Israel and Mecca and Medina would remain intact. Otherwise, the Muslim world's two holiest places would cease to exist. When the fate so long-wished upon Israel became the possible fate of the holy places, the hostilities ceased.    Looking back across fifty years of middle east peace reinforces the lesson. Weakness and appeasement can only bring death and destruction. Strength, resolve and decisive action can win victory over tyrants.|`|AA11790251	WW III began in three different locations.

At one point of time time, the US appeared at peace with its neigbors but the war was subversively continued as a coverted war in South America the arab OIL peninsula and Africa and  this even after the Soviet Union and gorbachev ended the cold war. ( Neo-cons liars, no Reagan did not end cold war, Gorbachev did)  Coverted war was the trick when the US sponsored and trained guerillas [ terrorism].  These guerillas were used against people wanting democracy.The US maintained war because democracy could represent an expense for the corporations wanting to make  profits or wanting cheap labour. Thus the US government even went on as to depose democratically elected government to replace it with outright dictatorships. Where areas the US intervened in a country, democracy has always been harder to implement.    After the soviet union economic system capitulated, The US focused on a new enemy, it shifted to a war upon poor people and the ideology is to secure profit for the corporation while maintening poverty in the world. The given attack inside the american social structure lead to consider that the war on the poor is also aimed at the poorest of american population including the immigrants that are exploited at slavery wages.      After the 9/11 attack, The US government used the anger of the US population to shift from coverted war to full blown open war upon other nations whom did not  even relates to the terrorists whom were responsible for the attacks.. Essentially the US succeeded with removing the nationalization of oil in these countries by replacing it by outright privatisation to benefit US corporations to the detriment of arabs. Thus the US succeeded in maintening a state of proverty upon the arab population.    This said the US is the only country that is doing  napoleonic war  upon other nations; Sir do not look for WW III, open your eyes, this is WW III and the US is the only attacker and instigator.

A new 9/11 attack every day?|`|AA12306484	personally, i think ww3 is upon us.|`|d93933e0b179d574de281c795d174ddbaa	just look at things going around you right now. this is world war 3. and keep and eye on how  protestant religion and Catholicism keeps going, if I were you, that would be my main concern.

When WW III Started****1979     This is not very long, but very informative. You have to read the catalogue of events in this brief piece. Then, ask yourself how anyone can take the position that all we have to do is bring our troops home from Iraq, sit back, reset the snooze alarm, go back to sleep, and no one will ever bother us again. In case you missed it, World War III began in November 1979... that alarm has been ringing for years.     US Navy Captain Ouimette is the Executive Officer at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida. Here is a copy of the speech he gave last month. It is an accurate account of why we are in so much trouble today and why this action is so necessary.    AMERICA NEEDS TO WAKE UP!    That's what we think we heard on the 11th of September 2001 (When more than 3,000 Americans were killed -AD) and maybe it was, but I think it should have been "Get Out of Bed!" In fact, I think the alarm clock has been buzzing since 1979 and we have continued to hit the snooze button and roll over for a few more minutes of peaceful sleep since then.    It was a cool fall day in November 1979 in a country going through a religious and political upheaval when a group of Iranian students attacked and seized the American Embassy in Tehran. This seizure was an outright attack on American soil; it was an attack that held the world's most powerful country hostage and paralyzed a Presidency. The attack on this sovereign U. S. embassy set the stage for events to follow for the next 25 years.    America was still reeling from the aftermath of the Vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the Soviet Union when then, President Carter, had to do something. He chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert. The ill-fated mission ended in ruin, but stood as a symbol of America's inability to deal with terrorism.    America's military had been decimated and down sized/right sized since the end of the Vietnam War. A poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start.    Shortly after the Tehran experience, Americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the Middle East. America could do little to protect her citizens living and working abroad. The attacks against US soil continued.    In April of 1983 a large vehicle packed with high explosives was  driven into the US Embassy compound in Beirut When it explodes, it kills 63 people. The alarm went off again and America hit the Snooze Button once more.    Then just six short months later in 1983 a large truck heavily laden down with over 2500 pounds of TNT smashed through the main gate of the US Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut and 241 US servicemen are killed. America mourns her dead and hit the Snooze Button once more.    Two months later in December 1983, another truck loaded with explosives is driven into the US Embassy in Kuwait, and America continues her slumber.    The following year, in September 1984, another van was driven into the gate of the US Embassy in Beirut and America slept.    Soon the terrorism spreads to Europe. In April 1985 a bomb explodes in a restaurant frequented by US soldiers in Madrid.    Then in August 1985 a Volkswagen loaded with explosives is driven into the main gate of the US Air Force Base at Rhein-Main, 22 are killed and the snooze alarm is buzzing louder and louder as US interests are continually attacked.    Fifty-nine days later in 1985 a cruise ship, the Achille Lauro is hijacked and we watched as an American in a wheelchair is singled out of the passenger list and executed.    The terrorists then shift their tactics to bombing civilian airliners when they bomb TWA Flight 840 in April of 1986 that killed 4 and the most tragic bombing, Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in1988, killing 259.    Clinton treated these terrorist acts as crimes; in fact we are still trying to bring these people to trial. These are acts of war.    The wake up alarm is getting louder and louder.    The terrorists decide to bring the fight to America. In January 1993, two CIA agents are shot and killed as they enter CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.    The following month, February 1993 , a group of terrorists are arrested after a rented van packed with explosives is driven into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people are killed and over 1000 are injured. Still this is a crime and not an act of war? The Snooze alarm is depressed again.    Then in November 1995 a car bomb explodes at a US military complex in Riyadh   Saudi Arabia killing seven service men and women.    A few months later in June of 1996, another truck bomb explodes only 35 yards from the US military compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It destroys the Khobar Towers, a US Air Force barracks, killing 19 and injuring over 500. The terrorists are getting braver and smarter as they see that America does not respond decisively.    They move to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.. These attacks were planned with precision. They kill 224. America responds with cruise missile attacks and goes back to sleep.    The USS Cole was docked in the port of Aden, Yemen for refueling on 12 October 2000 , when a small craft pulled along side the ship and exploded killing 17 US Navy Sailors. Attacking a US War Ship is an act of war, but we sent the FBI to investigate the crime and went back to sleep.    And of course you know the events of 11 September 2001. Most Americans think this was the first attack against US soil or in America. How wrong they are. America has been under a cons

However, we (I'm guessing you refer to immigrants) have the right to move about freely throughout the world.  It's part of those inalienable rights we're all born with...the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  If we think that may be achieved in China, the UK, Canada or the US, well then we do have the right to move.  All Americans are descendants of immigrants.  Americans still continue to look for better lives in other countries and they immigrate to other countries!    I have an uncle in Mexico who moved there from the US.  I also know of  Americans who have moved to Canada.  So you see, we all have the right to move about freely and find a better, more successful life anywhere we want.

I have a lot of feelings too, none of them good.    If you will look at some of the posts by SealRBorders, Renegade Shoban, Lillu69 and many others, you will see you are not alone.  True Americans don't like seeing our once beautiful country being turned into a cesspool by illegal Mexicans.

PI8VfiY1aa	Well, handling a problem privately would be settling out of court, or hiring an arbiter to resolve the issue.     Handling a problem publicly would mean taking the issue to court, or if we're not talking about a legal problem, handling a problem publicly could also mean letting the stockholders or the people resolve the issue (if applicable).    Now, you're asking 2 different questions here. Your second question is "How do I describe an institution preferring to keep its public informed on things?" and the answer to that is-- you would describe that as a "transparent organization."

Oh the republicans must be closed minded because they watch Fox, FOX is a Conservative station, etc etc.  Whenever I see this I know the person asking the question is liberal and thinks news stations like CNN and MSNBC are balanced, which their not.  Seems like you're being a bit closed minded as well just by your statement.    If I want a liberal view, I watch any other news show except FOX, I want a conservative view, I watch FOX.  Try watching both with an open mind, you might learn something.

Amendment 12    The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;    The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;    The person having the greatest Number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.    The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

ROFLMAO|`|IUXriZQJaa	Conservatives and "progressives" were part of the same liberal party. The "Progressive" libertines leaned too far to the left, and the conservatives wanted to hold true to original intent (as opposed to the bizarre 'living document' doctrine) and protect human life (as opposed to abortion and slavery). The Republican party was founded to abolish slavery. Its roots demand that it champion the cause of the unborn and abolish prenatal/neonatal homicide (abortion).  Affirmative Action was part of the democrats' response to their own inability to keep civil rights from being extended to dark-skinned people of apparent African descent. Democrats fought against abolition and against the civil rights movement. Most democrats have no idea that PASTOR Martin Luther King Jr was a Baptist Pastor and that "I have a dream" was a SERMON!  You can't fault them, though. They think only what and when they are told to think.|`|6kCws524aa	Duh, liberals sprang from pond scum.

Thats why he was a Republican !  If only he was elected..|`|bQLQdRBZaa	No. Serious answer. The origins of today's conservative ideology trace back to the early 1800s. Two threads. One, of course is the slave owner culture of the Old South, which stet "whites" up as supposedly superior to blacks. The other was in the North. There, the new class of factory owners. They created an ideology that was/is designed to discredit and dehumanize any employee as a means of justifying exerting social control and enying rights to workers (essentially what the slave owners did in the south).    An interesting and important development in the next century came around 1900 (+ or - 20 years). In both the NOrth and South, factory owners, as part of "welfare capitalism" built thousands of churches in the mill and factory towns and paid the bills--including the preachers.  ON CONDITION they not teach the (prior) ideology that emphasized the rights o fabor and instead preached unquestioning obedience to the authority of the employer.    This unholy trinity of anti-workingman, racism, and perverted Christianity collapsed in the North during the Depression. A strong labor movement backed by the Wagner Act that restored the civil rights and liberties of blue-collar Americans overwhelmed it.    Notin th eSouth. And--as a result of that same Depression and the events of WW2, millions of poor whites indoctrinated whith this ideology migrated to other parts of the country, seeking work. If you want to know where--look at a map of the REd/Blue states. It's almost a perfect 1-1 correlation.    That's where yur "conservatives came  from.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	do not insult the conservatives|`|ycNxVrUfaa	They haven't. You are confused.|`|VPayMLbjaa	Conservatives have always been here. We founded this country. From the Puritans to the Founding Fathers, they were all conservatives.    In the 60's a bunch of hippies did some LSD and imagines a new world, with no rules, free sex, no morals, just time, to sit around and get high. That was when Liberalism was born. Since then they have been steadily destroying everything we've built, as they work toward that utopia.|`|QtEFO13Baa	When they became afraid of seeing an influx of immigrants legal or not.     They have forgotten that their families for the most part have only been in this country for 3 or 4 generations.    Now what we have are a large amount of people who actually think they are members of the old guard,(WASP want to be's) protecting the USA from these new Americans. In reality  just a few generations back they were the unwanted  and stuck in slums.     All they really did was breed in great numbers and took over. The Irish are a great example of this, there was a prominent family that lived in Quincy just outside of Boston,The Adams family, Charles Francis Adams in 1930's packed it in and moved away from their homestead, because to many Irish moved into the area.They went north of Boston. Because the Irish were coming in great numbers to the area.I'm not making this up and free loading because of FDR," The poor were a happy lot till FDR came along, they didn't know they were poor"" That's a true quote.      People have to feel better than others, In the days of slaves the house slaves thought they were better than those who toiled in the fields.

32zBW5uCaa	The police would fill out a report, then talk to the guys involved before filing it.  Essentially, it will be their word against his, unless the cops can get one of them to admit to it.

Even if not I would still report that to the police. At minimum that was assault and aggravated battery.    EDIT:    Even if the agressors aren't convicted, just the fact that the cops now have an eye on them is something that they should and will be ashamed of and regret. If they even make the tiniest infraction of the law the cops will be more likely to arrest them than if some random person did the same thing.    EDIT:    Does your brother remember what they looked like?

lGKnuCJHaa	I completely agree 100%. If someone is murdered or has commit ed another serious crime they should receive capital punishment either by hanging or bringing back the Electric Chair. Unfortunately this country is too Lenient and it makes me sick. If someone commited a murder for example they should expect punishment off the same nature. This would free up our Prisons ( hence why it is over-crowded) and will issue a deterrent to those who wish to commit these crimes.    At the moment our country is a laughing stock because of the punishments dished out by Magistrates some off which are Beyond a Joke. So many crimes commited because the criminals know that they will get away with it or will just get a light sentence.|`|i405qKokaa	Never mind the killers...what about the scumbag paedophiles?There is widespread evidence to show that:  a) Treatment centres (aka Holiday Camps don't work) and   b) Long sentences (or life) are frequently shortened to allow scum back out onto the street as liberal judges don't seem to care about the potential of these monsters to commit crime.

But it hasn't worked in America, & lets be honest this place is getting more like it by the day, which makes me question if it will work. However, I cant see any other approach working either. The Labour Government have tried the soft touch approach which has helped make our country the worst in Western Europe for violent crime, probably one of the worst in the world. Innocent people are being murdered by the day in escalatingly more violent scenarios. You can get killed just by walking home from work now, and the killers are very likely to be under the age of 16. Lets be completely honest here.....Violent crime, especially the gang culture  murder rate is now out of control in this country. The other day someone got murdered for a 4 bottle of whine. When things like that happen often in a country that means its justice system & society has gone to pots.    I dont like the idea of killing someone, but when you have tried all other approaches, which this country has, how else do you deter people. Theres also the fact that more & more people are going to prison because of the growing crime rates, including murder, & this country hasnt got the space, or the money to house them for the rest of their lifes. And besides why the hell should I have to pay for some gang of callous, consciousless, evil, immoral, violent 16 yr olds who get kicks from attacking, and on the odd occasion when they get their own way, killing some poor innocent sod who is just walking back from work or going to the shops. The answer is I dont, & I would be more than happy to flick the switch or pull the lever or whatever my self, because its nothing more than what they deserve & it will make people of a similar mindset think twice before they decide to go out one night and just bloody kick someone to death for the sake of it.    Crime punishment should be an eye for an eye, but only when all other forms of punishment have been tried & failed, which is where this country is now. If having the death penalty means I can walk to the shops without getting kicked to death on the pavement floor for no bloody reason then I will vote for, pay for, & support it. And I also believe the age at which you can be executed should be brought down to 16.

DTSUJe2oaa	IntroductionThe debate on direct legislation, by the press and from the platform,produced no lasting contributions to political theory. It consisted ofpictures of the promised land by the advocates and forecasts of chaos bythe opponents, and both prophecies were liberally spiced with personaldenunciations approaching dangerously on libel.V. O. Key Jr. and Winston W. Crouch (1939)In many ways, little has changed in the sixty-six years since Key and  Crouch wrote this in 1939. The debate about the initiative process, a form  of direct democracy through which ordinary citizens can submit potential  legislation to a states voters for approval, still focuses on gloom and doom  predictions about the end of democracy in books with titles like Paradise  Lost (Schrag 1998), Democracy Derailed (Broder 2000), Dangerous  Democracy (Sabato, Ernst, and Larson 2001), and Democratic Delusions  (Ellis 2002). Yet at the same time, it is still staunchly defended by its sup-  porters as the best remedy for the ills of state government. The critics gen-  erally argue that the growing importance of money in initiative campaigns  restricts use of the initiative process to an elite set of interest groups. The  ironic part of this criticism is that the Populist and Progressive reformers  who fought for its adoption almost one hundred years ago intended it as a  recourse against wealthy economic interests that had seized control of state  legislatures. Even recent instances of grassroots uprisings like the hallowed  tax revolt of the late 1970s and early 1980s have come under attack as a  faux populist moment (Smith 1998).In many ways, these negative assessments of direct legislation, specifi-cally the initiative process, result from the failure of scholars to meet the  first criticism leveled by Key and Crouch: there have been few advances in  our theoretical understanding of how the initiative process influences politics.~

Everyone must go through the same application process regardless of who they are or what they have done! The only difference it may make is that once you have passed all the tests and are awaiting appointment your chosen force may have a critera of students that they must take such as how many women they need or people over a certain age etc! But this has nothing to do with your application but more to do with the chosen force itself and its something you will never be able to find out!

qpcYYWlIaa	It is a good legal question that law students, lawyers, judges and jurors sometimes struggle with, whenever there is a question of negligence or failure to exercise reasonable care.     Not knowing which specific state statute you are talking about and there are thousands I will give you a general answer. The standard itself does not ever change. It is always "the reasonable person standard" but it has twists. In some states and under certain circumstances they may take into account your individual characteristics, before applying the reasonable standard. But this is an exception and may not apply to driving at all.     Reasonable person standard is not easy to figure out. It is a legal standard. But this person always acts in a reasonable manner. For example they will slow down when they are suppose to, they would keep a reasonable distance between their own car and the car ahead,  slow down during the rain, obey street signs, etc. Even when this imaginary person makes mistakes they tend to be reasonable mistakes.    There is even a Harvard Law Review Article titled "In Search of the Reasonable Person" or something like that. Could be Prudent Person. He did not find that person. LOL     So if the statute says: "The operator is to exercise reasonable care at all times when operating a motor vehicle" and you did not; you are up against the reasonable person. This reasonable person in my mind is very close to a perfect person, though not entirely. So, if you have been careless, and the reasonable person would not have been under the same situation means you failed to exercise reasonable care or abide by the "Standard of Care". If on the other hand, the reasonable person would have behaved like you did, you did not break the law.    Doctors, in negligence cases are also judged by the reasonable person standard in the same or similar circumstances, except that the reasonable person in their cases is a reasonable doctor. A specialist surgeon is judged against a reasonable specialist. A police officer is judged against a reasonable police officer acting in the same or similar circumstance.      I hope that gives you some idea about "Standard of Care".|`|RgblqqxIaa	The standard of care you refer to is -  to exercise reasonable care which means - how would a reasonable and prudent person operate the car?  A reasonable and prudent person would pay attention to the road, follow the speed limits, not be on a cell phone, etc.  Generally, minors are held to a different standard of care, however, when they engage in adult activities such as driving they are held to the same standard of care as an adult driver.

If you don't have 24/7 authority, then you might need security guard certification.  Each Chief of Police determines if officers (both full-time and part-time) can be employed in secondary jobs. Check with your Chief for the official policy rules. Since they vary from community to community, only those that are specific to your community will apply.

AA10117764	US doves, led by the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have won the argument in Washington to lead the US in direct talks with Iran, which will agree on a package under which to end its enrichment of uranium.     In exchange, it will receive a bag of goodies that will include help with civil nuclear power (including a nuclear power station and the fuel to go with it) and trade concessions.     US hawks in Washington have gone along with the move in the belief that an offer of direct talks now will improve their arguments for military action later. It also helps to keep Russia and China on board.     The hawks think this initiative will lead nowhere because Iran will not negotiate seriously even if it agrees to talks - and when it all breaks down, they will have been shown to have gone the extra mile.     They would then press for a mandatory Security Council resolution ordering Iran to suspend enrichment and then, if Russia and China blocked sanctions, they would call for unilateral measures by the US and its allies.     If that failed, then eventually there would be discussion of a military strike.     Stay tuned folks!|`|AA11899477	Hopefully send some B52's over!|`|AA12354469	grow corn in desert.|`|AA10617776	when the petrol f?nnesh ?n ?raq they try to make war ?n ?ran th?s ?s so easy quest?on everyth?ng ?s coverded w?th name of peace but under th?s we can see money money

I would however, like with an invention, not hide your idea but share your idea with trusted people that can back up the timing and the complete idea for proof.  Your lawyer would be also a good person.  The problem with something like this is they can say they came up with the idea without seeing your information even if that is not true.  At least call a copy right attorney's office and get some info.  I do not think the cost is to high compared to other legal services.     The complete other side is, what do you want to do with this.  If you want to use it or sell the idea then it has value, maybe.  If you do not care and you just want credit for the idea it is a completely different thing.  Remember finance people are conservative.    Good luck.

Our State legislature makes laws that are difficult or impossible to enforce.  IE the NYS Cell phone law.|`|AA12064129	Its a legitimate use of state power to mandate that cars have working brakes because if my car has poorly functioning brakes, I risk the lives of others and I have no right to do so.  If I dont require my kids to wear a helmet this should be well within my rights.  As to the idea that a lack of helmet use is a growing public health issue that costs us all billions of dollars every year, that is not a problem of liberty.  It is a problem of socialism.  No human should be coerced by the state to bear the medical expense, or any other expense, for his fellow man.  In other words, the forcible use of one person to serve the purposes of another is morally offensive.  I personally wear a helmet each time I ride; its a good idea.  However, because something is a good idea doesnt necessarily make a case for State compulsion.  The justifications used for helmet laws easily provide the template and soften us up for other forms of government control over our lives and our children.  For example, my weekly exercise routine consists of two days strength training and three days aerobic training.  I think its a good idea.  Like helmet use, regular exercise extends lives and reduces health care costs.  Heres my question to you and others who sanction the helmet laws: Should the government mandate daily exercise for the same reasons they cite to support mandatory helmet use, namely, that to do so would save lives and save billions of health care dollars?  If we accept the notion that government ought to protect us from ourselves, were on a steep slippery slope.  Obesity is a major contributor to hypertension, coronary disease, and diabetes, and leads not only to many premature deaths but also to billions of dollars in health care costs.  Should government enforce, depending on a persons height, sex, and age, a daily 1,400 to 2,000-calorie intake limit?  There is no dietary reason to add salt to our meals.  High salt consumption can lead to high blood pressure, which can then lead to stroke, heart attack, osteoporosis, and asthma.  Should government outlaw adding salt to meals?|`|30a95b2c4ea5638ae1ec798014be5b56aa	I'm 17 i dont ride a bike anymore but i did alot when i was young and i never hurt my head and neither has anyone i know so i don't see it as a big problem.

AA10091182	In most US states, the man's estate below about $50,000.00 would all go to the new wife.  Above $50,000.00, the new wife would share the estate with the children.  In some states, she would get 50% and the two children would split the other half.  In some states, she would get 33% and the two children would each get a third as well.  Non-probate assets like life insurance payable to the wife and a house owned as joint tenants would just go to the new wife outright and would not be counted in the above-cited split.    So long as the children are alive, the children of the children have no right to inherit anything.  If a grandchild is alive but his parent (the child) is dead, the grandchild would take in his parent's (the child's) place.    You should consult a probate attorney.|`|AA10400543	How the estate will be divided depends on the law of the state (in the US) or the country the decedent resided in at the time of the death.    I assume it is the man who died, not the second wife.    In general:    First, any property held by the man and the second wife in joint tenancy will go to the surviving joint tenant.    Second, in a Community Property state, half of the community property acquired during the second marriage belongs to the second wife as a matter of right.    Third, the children of the first marriage (or their children if either of them have died) split the remaining property with the second wife.  The exact split depends on the state's law.  In most states, the deceased's children (or their children) will get 2/3rds and the second wife gets 1/3rd.    If you need more detailed legal advice, consult an attorney in the appropriate state.  Attorney fees for probating an estate come out of the estate property.  If there is any property that is not in joint tenancy there will have to be a probate of the estate.
ccc16c21ec8281679c13578077bef6f0aa	Our company collects on civil judgments nationwide.    The statute of limitations for Florida for domestic (in-state) judgments is 7 years.  In other words, you have the right for 7 years to collect on the judgment.  At the 7 year point, you can renew the judgment by filing some simple paperwork at the courthouse where you obtained a judgment.  Within those 7 years (and the years after, if you renew), your debtor is obligated to satisfy the judgment.  The debtor is also obligated to satisfy the interest and court costs.  If left unpaid for many years, your judgment will be worth much more than $2,000, and your debtor will still be obligated for the full amount.    Florida is a notoriously debtor-friendly state, and you will need to aggressively pursue your collection.  The first step for you in the collection process is to thoroughly investigate what your debtor owns that is seizable under Florida state law.  Some of this information is not easily obtainable, especially bank account information, and you will need to be willing to use a reputable asset search firm or investigator to find the information.    You can also hand your judgment over to a judgment recovery firm, although we routinely counsel against this for smaller judgments.  The standard profit sharing rate is 50/50, and the cost/benefit ratio is really not worth it for the creditor.  Frankly, with a little "elbow grease" and good information, most small claims creditors can pursue the judgment themselves.      As a side note, it is questionable whether you will be able to garnish wages in Florida, especially if your debtor is the head of household.    Please contact me, and I can give you more information.  We also have a website with useful information to the judgment creditor, especially our FAQ - http://www.jcsusa.com/About%20Us%20and%2...    Thanks and best wishes.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Go back to the court and ask the judge to garnish the person's wages or slap a lein against his property.

AA11560796	Summary courts marshall (regardless of the crime) max punishment is 30 days in the brig, two ranks lost and forfeture of 2/3 pay for a month.  The six month quote you got is for special courts martials.  Summary is kind of like a super NJP, but you are not convicted of a crime.  Special and general CM's are the ones that give you a felony record.    Summary Court-Martial  Trial by summary court-martial provides a simplified procedure for the resolution of charges involving minor incidents of misconduct.  The summary court-martial consists of one officer who, depending upon service policies and practice, may be a judge advocate (a military attorney).  The maximum punishment a summary court-martial may impose is considerably less than a special or general court-martial.  The accused must consent to be tried by a summary court-martial.   Special Court-Martial  A special court-martial is the intermediate court level.  It consists of a military judge, trial counsel (prosecutor), defense counsel, and a minimum of three officers sitting as a panel of court members or jury.  An enlisted accused may request a court composed of at least one-third enlisted personnel.  An accused, officer or enlisted, may also request trial by judge alone. Regardless of the offenses involved, a special court-martial sentence is limited to no more than six months confinement (or a lesser amount if the offenses have a lower maximum), forfeiture of two-thirds basic pay per month for six months, a bad-conduct discharge (for enlisted personnel), and certain lesser punishments. An officer accused in a special court-martial cannot be dismissed from the service or confined.  Note: The maximum confinement will become one year and the maximum forfeiture duration will also become one year in the near future.    General Court-Martial  A general court-martial is the most serious level of military courts.  It consists of a military judge, trial counsel, defense counsel, and at least five court members.  Again, an enlisted accused may request a court composed of at least one-third enlisted personnel.  Unless the case is one in which the death sentence could be adjudged, an officer or enlisted accused may also request trial by judge alone.  In a general court-martial, the maximum punishment is that established for each offense under the Manual for Courts-Martial, and may include death (for certain offenses), confinement for life, a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge for enlisted personnel, a dismissal for officers, or a number of other lesser forms of punishment.  A pretrial investigation under Article 32, UCMJ, must be conducted before a case may be referred to a general court-martial, unless waived by the accused.|`|AA12240505	RIR to E1 or O1, 30 days bread & water, dishonorable discharge.

AA12136089	It was formally signed on August 2, 1776, with some members adding their names after that date.      Historic US document stating the theory of government on which the USA was founded, based on the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The statement was issued by the Continental Congress on 4 July 1776, renouncing all allegiance to the British crown and ending the political connection with Britain.    Following a resolution moved on 7 June, by Richard Henry Lee, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, a committee including Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin was set up to draft a declaration; most of the work was done by Jefferson.    The resolution, coming almost a year after the outbreak of hostilities, was adopted by the representatives of 12 colonies (New York abstained initially) on 2 July, and the Declaration on 4 July; the latter date has ever since been celebrated as Independence Day in the USA. The representatives of New York announced their adhesion on 15 July, and the Declaration was afterwards signed by the members of Congress on 2 August.    The declaration enumerated the grievances the colonists harboured against the British crown, which included its use of American Indians to attack colonists, taxation without representation, and denial of civil liberties|`|e5570c6ca251e01755386dcf996888dfaa	it wasnt!!!???

No one , I mean no one has a right to threaten anyone .|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I have never received death threats on Yahoo, but when my husband passed away, I received a lot of them from his family.  They threatened me over our land, based on jealousy and greed.  I am thankful that my late husband didn't have to see how his parents really are.  Just goes to show, people's true colors come out upon a death of a loved one.  And we had all been so close, it came as a shock that they would be that way.  Death threats are no fun and should always be taken seriously.  If someone on Yahoo threatens you, notify Yahoo and they will take care of it.|`|c59a4010def6f797e0a0e7c583f93ec6aa	No, but you should report as Illegal activity and also file a police report. I actually found some idiot on here saying he was going to kill the president, so I contacted yahoo answers and the secret service/FBI. They actually opened a case on it so don' t think this stuff is taken lightly by anyone.|`|wsF1bXL3aa	yes,prob because i asked a tongue in cheek question about a region where people live and whether they marry their sisters or cousins. i my have deserved that threat thinking back but didn't bother me though.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	No i havent as of yet and if you have tehn please report tehm to yahoo and report them to the proper authorities|`|087c14ef810cae54ec446439f9012410aa	yes i have ignored them because they won't so it because they just want to scare you.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	No way!

Definitely block any any instant messaging.Do you allow Y!A to send your emails or do you give out your address? I have not looked at your profile tonight. But if you do show your address remove it and get a new address<br>  Keep the threat and make copies and file a report with Y!A along with Yahoo itself. I would then file a police report.

But to be on the safe side make sure you cover all the bases. Tara.<br>  <br>  EDIT>>>>>>>> I think e mails can now be traced from most areas of the Internet.

B5Y46XBoaa	Absolutely and they're still under his hypnotic spell with all the same programmed responses he was feeding them from the beginning.  <br>  <br>  A vote for McCain would be a vote for four more years of Bush? Come on.. there is absolutely NO truth to that lie because it's well documented that McCain and Bush locked horns plenty of times on extremely important issues. It was a FEAR tactic. <br>  <br>  Sarah Palin was an idiot? Come on... Sarah Palin was a truly devout Christian, something that REALLY threatened Obama because his claim to Christianity is as false as anything else he put out there. And because the majority of his voter base only likes the wishy washy self-proclaimed Christians like him and hates real Christians he played heavily on that HATRED and used it to his advantage making her out to be the idiot they wanted her to be.<br>  <br>  Not one of the people voting for him cared anything about the man's character and they were convinced by him that all those past associations and tons of missing information was just attempts to assassinate his character by McCain.  They would have voted in Hitler under this spell because they were convinced McCain was to be feared, Palin was to be hated, and they were both attacking poor Obama who never really answered for any of it.  And what did they attack him with??? Oh no... the truth. How horrible of them.<br>  <br>  Well, they let themselves be hypnotized into lining up like drones for him, so they deserve what he's getting ready to do to this country. Unfortunately, those of us who had our eyes wide open during this campaign don't deserve it. |`|1amF7oNwaa	ABSOLUTELY|`|zMcHYQeBaa	Yes, but I think that was just election hysteria.

I have friends like that.  It does appear as if they are brainwashed, because they don't vote on issues only on parties. I can't stand people like this. <br>  <br>  But hey, it's politics and in politics, the way to get elected typically is build yourself up and make people become "brain-washed" for you. Obama will not do all of the things he has said he will and McCain would not have either. That's just how it is! :) <br>  <br>  Personally, I was not SUPER fond of either of the candidates, however I did vote for Obama after weighing both candidates, stances on issues. Let's hope he can make a change for the better to some degree! :)<br>  <br>  ADD: Not sure why I'm getting thumbs down. All I said is that there is "brainwashing" from both parties. Is that not true? Have you not seen some super radicals out there? Or did you just not even bother to actually read what I wrote? hmmmm<br>  <br>  Are these the hard-core Obama fans that are giving me thumbs down beacuse they just assumed that I was going to trash Obama?

A terrorist implies the intentional targeting and killing of civilians while hiding from any military units and refusing to engage in military combat at all possible costs.<br>  <br>  THROUGHOUT the American Revolution, the press in Britain portrayed the commander of the rebel army as a model of citizen virtue and an ideal military leader. Most press reports supported the effort to crush the rebellion and considered the Continental Congress a den of self-serving scoundrels but heaped praise on George Washington, the American Cincinnatus. The general personified the dilemma that faced many Britons during the conflict: he was a quintessential English-American gentleman, despite being the enemy. He represented much of what the British Atlantic community thought admirable while commanding an army in a cause that many Britons believed would ruin the empire. He had fought for king and country in the Seven Years' War and had even served with a number of the British officers who commanded the king's troops during the War of Independence. He was not from New England and so was not tarred with the radicalism most Britons associated with the region and blamed for the outbreak of hostilities.1 Nor was he a professional soldier. Instead, Washington was a successful member of Virginia's planting elite, thus having much in common with the country gentlemen who dominated the House of Commons--more indeed than some of Britain's own military leaders. His letters, printed in the newspapers, revealed a devotion to politeness and civic virtue that alone would have won him admiration in any British county society.|`|9q3PSPIgaa	Yes, maybe not in the same term, but by definition he would have incorrectly been considered a terrorist.<br>  <br>  This seems to be a common theme in trying equate and judge people who lived and died 200 + years ago by today's warped standards.  To compare George Washington with a terrorist is one of the greatest insults I've seen on these boards.<br>  <br>  He did NOT target civilians, nor did he fight in a dishonorable manner.  He fought in the standard military method of the time.  He did use the militias, who would fight in a guerrilla fashion.<br>  <br>  Also, the comment on Hamas is a bit off target.  Hamas is an organization with both a political wing (those you say were democratically elected) and a military wing (you know, the ones blowing things up).  They are very similar in some aspects to the IRA.<br>  <br>  The Warlock|`|604963ef82ec90b5bd0becdfe005c25eaa	The British legally ruled this land before we established a government and gained our independence.  I'm sure Washington's actions did terrorize many people who thought it was wrong to cross the king.<br>  <br>  For Brown...... Al-Qayda and the Taliban were formed by USA and Bin Laden worked for the CIA.  Does that make them good guys or bad guys?|`|oFzrNIezaa	Well, terrorists didn't exhist back then, so no. George Washington is a hero. He dedicated his life for the freedom of the colonies. At the end of the war his army and much of the people asked him to become king of America. He declined because he did not want to throw away all that the colonies had done to get rid of being controlled by a monarchy. that shows loyalty and dedication to his cause. Last time I heard, terrorsits don't like democracy.|`|CW8ah4Wgaa	That cinches it. You sold me.<br>  <br>  Hamas, Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba must ALL BE GOOD GUYS because the British used the same word to describe Washington that we use to describe them.|`|EGWzEwizaa	He was never a terrorist.<br>  He did commit treason to the King.<br>  Look up what a terrorist is and you will learn something today.<br>  Then read a history book.<br>  And no Israel is not a terrorist country......because that is what you are getting at...right a**hole|`|nQrBitMpaa	George Washington and his soldiers did not target civilians like your beloved terrorists and hamas.<br>  <br>  LHFP- HA!!! thats a good one coming from you. me thinks you need to put down the bong and wash your che guevara shirt, hippie.|`|38S1xXNeaa	He very well was.  As were most revolutionists.  But, the term itself didn't exist.  I'm sure they called Washington a lot of things.|`|rGbWNPSuaa	probably if the word was around back then<br>  well if you think about it he was he went against the government and in their view committed "treason"|`|nEMM74iVaa	No, the word "terrorist" did not exist back then.
EPObVPzVaa	Yes, time to break it up.  Most regions of this country are as different from the others as countries in Europe.<br>  <br>  I say give Main, Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusettes to Canada.  They're all commies anyway.  Give NY Connecticut and NJ to the Mafia.  They really are the only ones who know how to run them and make a profit.  Central Florida too.  It's mostly New Yorkers anyway.  We can keep northern Florida.  Miami and all points south can be given to Cuba.  Let Fidel try and figure out South Beach and the Keys. Him getting back the Marielitos would be poetic justice.  California and Texas should be granted independence except for San Fransisco.  San Fran should be consolidated with Oregon and Washington and merged with North Korea.  They'll fit right in.  Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin should all be evacuated.  Humans shouldn't be living in those temperatures.  Hold Michigan in case we need to sweeten the pot with Canada.  They may push back on taking Vermont.  Who wouldn't?  If they take Vermont, give Michigan to the muslims, they're taking it over anyway...see Dearborn.  Keep West Virginia for the coal and send all dental students there for training.  If they can make a permanent set of teeth there, they can do it anywhere.  New Mexico and Arizona goes to Mexico.  Just call it Azatlan, they own it anyway.  Give Wyoming to the Palestinians, we're not using it.  Keep Utah, I ski. But, move the mormons to Vegas and let them start their own country.  That should be fun to watch.  Just flood Louisiana, enough already.  That whole state is not worth the price of the levees. Alabama just sux which is why Florida doesn't float away.  If we are to keep any part of Florida, Alabama must stay. We must take the bad with the good.<br>  Make Arkansas an empire all it's own and the Clintons will have something to rule.  That ought to shut them up for awhile. <br>  The remaining states would be a very nice, quiet and managable set of confederates except for Illinois.  We can declare war on them and make it part of Kentucky. There, done.

We are too big and diverse to stay together. Also we (the U.S.) are running ourselves into the ground trying to pay all the useless government employees. I don't think the split will be just 2 ways, north and south. I think most states will become independent countries. Some of the small or less populated ones maybe joining with others (like NY and NJ). I don't know what I think about this. I think it will be a fact but am not sure if it is a good idea or not. It seems to work for Europe, right now anyway. Hopefully we won't have to go through as many wars since we have pre-drawn boundaries. <br>  My take is ppl will gravitate to state that most closely fit their lifestyle (political, religious, moral beliefs).

E le leggi europee? Inseriamo la trazione integrale e ci passiamo sopra facendo la solita figuraccia made in Italy....non sarebbe la prima volta. Si vede propio che non sanno pi dove raspare soldi. La storia che poi ci vogliono togliere una grossa percentuale del TFR per investirlo, farlo fruttare, per poterci pagare le pensioni integrative mi fa venire voglia di prenderli a mazzate sulle gengive. Soldi NOSTRI  buttati dentro un colabrodo, per poi darti (se sopravvivi) una miseria al mese. L'altra percentuale tassata alla fonte e siamo a posto. Secondo me sti maledetti lo fanno apposta a cambiare destra con sinistra e viceversa per giustificare le finanziarie NECESSARIE per salvare il Paese dagli sprechi del governo precedente.

L'unica nazione della NATO a trarre vantaggi dalla sua esistenza sono infatti gli USA che usano le basi europee (italiane in particolare) per condurre le loro operazioni nei paesi arabi e africani.

866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Non amo nessuno dei due, per mi da fastidio che il parere su questi soggetti dipenda da propaganda politica sporca.  Su Berlusconi la sinistra ha imbastito una campagna assurda per demolirlo facendo assegnamento sull'ignoranza popolare.  Certamente non  uno stinco di santo ma le cose inventate su di lui sono uno schifo, si  detto che:  1) voleva fare un colpo di stato e la gente stupida ci ha creduto, come se in Italia fosse possibile, non siamo musulmani n africani, un golp non lo accetterebbe nessuno da qualsiasi parte venga, nemmeno il suo partito lo accetterebbe.  2) Che abbia fatto il politico per rimediare a un presunto stato di fallimento, in barba al fatto che non ha mai chiesto aiuto alle banche e non ha mai messo nessuno in cassa integrazione. E' vero anzi che ha anticipato cifre colossali per formare un partito nuovo, credete che si faccia coi bruscolini? Ma ai politici uno che non veniva dal club molto esclusivo della politica, che non avesse fatto il portaborse per tre anni gratis a un politico divenendo poi il suo pupillo adorante per subentrare alla sua morte o al suo improbabile ritiro (perch funziona cos) fa grande scandalo, perch vuol dire che si pu accedere alla politica anche dal di fuori, cosa temutissima in Italia ma democraticamente usata all'estero, soprattutto in America (l'unica altra eccezione era Cicciolina ma non hanno protestato perch non costituiva minaccia e quella si che all'estero ha fatto ridere).  3) Che possieda il monopolio dell'informazione, quando i due terzi dei giornali sono di sinistra, per la TV:  Rai3, La Sette, Videomusic e Telemontecarlo sono di sinistra, Canale 4 e Canale 5 di destra. Senza contare che dei primi due canali nessuno  stato mai di destra, perch quando furono spartite dai partiti per la statalizzazione la destra non fu ammessa, ma fu divisa tra democristiani, comunisti e socialisti col famoso "Bagno di sangue" che cacci via tutti quelli che tendevano a destra.   Quel che fa rabbia  che le sue reti vanno bene perch come imprenditore Berlusca  molto valido.  4) Sulle figuracce all'estero, anche se ha perso molte occasioni per starsi zitto,  stimatissimo in particolare da Americani, Russi, Inglesi. In America  stato pubblicato dal famoso Life che l'ha definito "uomo dell'anno" con la foto in prima pagina, cosa che non ha mai ottenuto un italiano ed  stato l'unico a intrattenere amicizie personali con capi esteri, cosa che nessun altro ha mai saputo fare.  5) Si  detto che  in combutta con la mafia, naturalmente l'ha divulgato la sinistra, ma Berlusca non aveva interesse ha farlo altrimenti avrebbe impiantato industrie al sud, invece ci sono solo i suoi canali esattamente come ci sono gli altri, allora sono tutti mafiosi.  6) Sicuramente evade il fisco come tutte le grandi aziende, ma  stato sempre un grande contribuente mentre Agnelli per secoli si  dichiarato in perdita con la complicit della sinistra, mentre ha molta pi ricchezza di Berlusconi, ma siccome dava mazzette alla sinistra si  sempre taciuto. Berlusconi non ha mai partecipato alle riunioni dei Grandi, Agnelli si perch  uno dei pi grandi capitalisti della terra, ma non ha dato fastidio a nessuno perch non  mai entrato in politica. La differenza  Berlusconi  strainquisito e gli altri no. Dove stava la finanza quando fallivano l'IRI, la Cirio, la Parmalat etc.? Non lo sapevano che c'era l'inghippo? Non li guardavano i conti? E la Telecom? Come mai le grosse aziende non sono mai inquisite e quando cadono tutti si meravigliano degli inghippi mentre Berlusconi  quotidianamente inquisito?    A me Berlusconi non piace ma il comportamento della sinistra nei suoi confronti mi fa schifo,  antidemocratico.   In quanto a Prodi il suo passato non gli fa onore, ha fatto fallire l'IRI e la Cirio, se fosse stato onesto avrebbe portato alla luce i misfatti che c'erano sotto, invece ha aiutato a coprire tutto, del resto  un ex DC. Poi ha rifiutato il confronto faccia a faccia con Berlusconi nelle ultime elezioni e il confronto in parlamento sulla Telecom (per chi non lo sapesse non ha risposto, ha solo presenziato), che ha da nascondere? E dal punto di vista psichico  un bambino che fa il bravo bambino, con le mossette da bambino e la vocina innocente. Ehi, gli manca il ciucciotto in bocca, ma non lo vedete quanto  comico?  Pur non essendo di destra preferisco Berlusconi che si pavoneggia, perch Prodi  un caso clinico.|`|bd9b084ade30c8f3dc756b25ca108b8faa	tra i due sicuramente Berlusconi|`|57dcdf4cbbdc57a60920cff86c56221aaa	tra la m_erda e la spazzatura meglio la spazzatura PRODI|`|9e7b22a680aa8fd16382e985ea4dba78aa	angela merkel|`|e646ac213e4f7e4e1573bc669d077a23aa	Se l 'alternativa fosse strettamente riservata ad entrambi...Berlusconi!!!|`|b0fdad7a5104399162d1550875dcd038aa	Cha pa.lle tt la stessa domanda!! ma la fantasia ve la siete mangiati cn la mortadella(Prodi)?|`|3938e61ad7250986142e1f4ff049a4adaa	Tra tutti e due....|`|5109dd3574f383e600607bbcd9f708a6aa	Nessuno dei due ha uno schieramento credibile  Nessuno dei due sa ben amministrare la politica interna  Ma almeno Berlusconi ha un feeling con i potenti esteri che ci permette di valere qualcosa a livello globale.

AA12353028	technically an invalid question.the dentists NEVER joined the NHS and have always been private. When the nHS was set up the dentists refused to come on board  what happend is they subsequently agreed (ony cos it was profitable to them) to accept state set fees (so called NHS) to see other patients  Now it isnt so they dont  Answer..well they accept state money (in that they get their training for five years at a state university) so if they then wont work for the stae (NHS) then the state should demnd repayment x5 plus interest at standard rates.|`|AA11431483	The national health service website should give you further details of where you can find a Nhs dentist.  They are getting hard to find and books usually only open once every year for registeration... if you keep up your with the every 6 months appointments/check-ups, they will not take you off the books.    If you want to complain see this link:http://www.dh.gov.uk/ContactUs/Complaint...|`|ba2d2dc2174d27dfcb9251daddc000aeaa	i don't know who you can complain to but if you phone nhs direct they will give you the name of an nhs dentist that will take you on. the whole nhs dentist system had been re-done and there are now a simpler set of charges (i think there are three levels)
AA11741469	It's not. The problem is religion. People get on their ridiculous religious high horses and feel like they get to dictate how the rest of us live. It's ironic, considering the Bible tells people not to judge. I don't understand why people care so much of homosexuals get married. It doesn't harm anyone, and it doesn't effect anyone but those who are homosexual. It really pisses me of, honestly, that ignorant, selfish, cold people could vote for Proposition 8. Those people disgust me. Anyone familiar with history knows that at one point in time it was illegal for blacks to marry whites because people thought it was unnatural and disgusting. Now people think that's a ridiculous notion. Hopefully one day these jerks will look back and feel the same about homosexual marriage.|`|0e44f70a22356b4ec7f3b9dc96adf5bbaa	Yes. Not a human right. Something else indeed.<br>  <br>  Religion.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a religious right.<br>  Civil union is a civil right.<br>  <br>  Gay couples don't have the right to have the government declare them as "married".<br>  But that's not a right a government is justified in giving to heterosexual couples either. Not unless it is a theoracy.<br>  <br>  People have to make up their mind.<br>  If gay people push too fast for "Marriage" without being coherent or thinking it through<br>  resistance should be expected.<br>  <br>  Increased resistance should be expected to come from unexpected places.<br>  <br>  Gay people deserve, just as human beings, as Americans who keep America alive, deserve same basic rights as the rest of us. But they are also getting a little overboard with the political egotistical fussing. Not everything liberal this decade is about gay people first, everybody else second.<br>  <br>  "Gay" rights are at the top of the list while we still step ove people on sidewalks who don't have a roof over their head in one of the wealthiest nations on Earth.|`|7EV9fqM3aa	Marriage is a religious thing. What does and does not define a binding contract in faith between two individuals is a matter of the faith(s) to which they belong. <br>  <br>  Tax breaks are a governmental thing. It's absurd that anyone should get any sort of tax break for engaging in a religious contract. Whether single or married we should pay the same taxes. There is no logic in taxing people differently based solely on their marital status.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage is a religious issue and, according to the first amendment, has no business being decided by federal or state governments. It has no business being decided by anyone outside of the people involved and their religions. <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe marriage is about love and not even religion can dictate what defines love.<br>  <br>  But, yeah, gay marriage is, at the very least, a constitutional right given the very clear delineation in the constitution between government and religion.|`|c878ba3b6c9aa2d86aed0bde7375c751aa	It is a human rights issue. It's also a separation of church and state issue. The only argument against gay marriage is a religious one. We are supposed to have a secular government in America, but the truth is we don't. <br>    The fact that it was ever an option to vote away someones rights because certain peoples religious beliefs say that it's wrong proves that theocratic laws ARE passed in this country and that is extremely alarming on many levels to any intelligent person who places a value on personal liberty.|`|RyVg17t4aa	remember that the institution of marriage involves two people of opposite sexes.( male & female).<br>  marriage is the right of all people ..that's right...& there is no ban in a gay or lesbians marrying a person of the opposite sex.<br>  The question at hand is same sex marriage..ie between man & man<br>  & between woman & woman....which most unethical /unnatural/unholy/<br>  ab-noxious/loathsome/ & a disgrace to the very  purpose of  gender .<br>  If the gays think it is their human right ...it is all the more a human right of the masses of the people to oppose degradation,deterioration in the morality & principles  leading to destruction of the very fabric of humanity. <br>  I would also oppose the adoption of children by gays.....Because it would be infringement into the rights of the innocent minor..depriving the child of a mother.....a man can never replace a woman's place as a mother.... <br>  In adoption, there should be a  woman & a man to take the place of a mother & a father for the welfare of the child...THE HUMAN RIGHT OF THE CHILD. |`|FS30OFIAaa	Marriage is a religious ceremony that just happens to be supported by the government. If the religion doesn't want to perform gay ceremonies they shouldn't be obligated to. That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be a state certified joining of some sort so that homosexual couples can get the same tax cuts and other benefits, but homosexuals pushing to get married is a stupid waste of money and time. <br>  <br>  Really, the religious and uptight heterosexuals should fully support homosexuals being able to join. As long as homosexuals are able to have couples and aren't being forced into a heterosexual relationship, there is little chance of homosexuals having biological offspring. <br>  <br>  |`|0yjqIj3Zaa	Well... I don't think it is fair. My best friend is gay and i worry everyday that someone is going to try and pass a bill that is going to keep him from his happiness and i really don;t want that to happen. I don't think government is anyplace for religion and only the religious are getting upset over gay marriage. I dont think that they should ever try and stop people from the pursuit of happiness....|`|HdgA8pLqaa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  I don't understand how people use their religious beliefs and apply it to a legal matter.  (Separation of church and state - hello!)<br>  <br>  The only difference between gay & straight people are the sex of the people that share their bed.  That's it - why is that so difficult to understand?  If someone doesn't agree with it, then stay out of their bedroom!<br>  <br>  We passed Prop 2 which will take better care of animals - even those which will end up as our dinner - yet we deny gay people basic human rights.<br>  <br>  Shameful.|`|87a97307eb84f6b093dc19657dda478aaa	It depends on the personal affair, if it's harmful to another person in any way then it is their business. <br>  <br>  When it comes to marriage I can understand not wanting to re-define the term itself, but the definition doesn't have to change for Gays to be able to marry.|`|MUC8vWjvaa	I am with you all the way man, I'm atheist and my take on the situation is that people were raised on the bible think it is against what God believes in. To some this means that it shouldn't happen, therefore it won't. I do not see the big deal either. I have a gay friend and shes a person too. Hardcore cristians have what they believe is right and we have what we believe as right. Simple as that, and we can't change what they think. I was talking to my friend the other day, and she said that people choose to be gay which is not true. If other people believe this than they may think the people are trying to be sinful and revolt against God. We cannot change how people think, or how people act. We can only live and let live.|`|5hTnvnKqaa	Since marriage is recognized by law, and has been separated from church, has become a legal contract and not just a religious ceremony, Gay marriage is definitely a human rights issue.|`|S42yzY99aa	it's not really fair. this country was found by MOSTLY religious people. that's really the only reason gay marriage is illegal. There's no logical reason aside from religious ones, that prove it's wrong|`|NT1MTsJeaa	I believe it is a humanity issue.  Why should the religious right have the right to dictate what people can and can not do?  I hope that one day we can live in a more just world.|`|i8QWz52Naa	I don't know.

They are allowed to be homosexual, they can have open relationships, in most areas, they can have the same benefits as a heterosexual couple.  If I beat up a straight person, because I don't like the fact he is living with his girlfriend, I get a misdemeanor charge of simple assault, Now put a gay couple in the same mix, I am charged with a felony hate crime.  <br>  <br>    Who cares if they cal|`|8x40xeDXaa	who the govmt chooses to recognize as legally married has to deal with the lives of every american. if the govmt has to recgnizes gay couples than it will have to taught in the class room as appropriate n normal. gay marriage being legalized would change the constitutions definition of marriage, which would be more than likely to include polygamy. <br>  <br>  i believe that religions can recognize who/whatever they want to as marriage, but only one man n one woman be recognized by the state.|`|h5jk4JSBaa	 It is a violation of us gay's constitutional rights not to be able to marry. There was a time when inter-racial marriage was illegal because it was considered wrong. We all have the right to live our life how we choose. Freaking Bible Thumpers need to realize it's a new world and they cant control everything!!!|`|7OpFE5zAaa	It is not a human right to tell someone that can't marry who they love.  am against homosexuality but still think that gays should be able to marry. Our government has way too much control in our lives. Love is love and that is that. My wife is Mexican and I'm white, I see no difference between that and two people of the same sex marrying. While I don't agree with being gay I still stand up for the fact they should have every right that heterosexuals do!|`|cMB94PBkaa	well they dont alow it because if they want to get married at a church or have a preacher and its against the churches or preachers religion to have gay marrage so they so no, then the gays sue them and then they have to shut down or they dont get as much money to orphans if there charitable or starving kids the churches would need the money to keep the church and not for people who need it|`|5AVtXD1Uaa	Marriage is defined as one man and one woman.  We're not against, at least I'm not, homosexuals making a life for themselves.  They still have every right in society as they should. There should be another word to define gay relationship/committments. Why choose a heterosexual definition?    |`|Z6Xapf9Laa	human's rights issue... and a religious issue... this has been brought up so many time's in the past but im totally for gay marriage! i believe people should be able to do what they want to do without being judged by a "higher power"|`|Us2AYN2oaa	it isn't. denying homosexuals the right to marry is an injustice. basically, you're saying that certain people can get married while others can't. that's a threat to justice. like MLK said "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."|`|9mTMVJMjaa	Would it be OK to make it a legal issue if I liked to hump sheep?

Fra tutti i paesi di credo islamico, la Turchia , comunque, quello piu' vicino a noi. Lo dimostra il fatto che i suoi dirigenti non tralasciano occasione, per manifestare questo loro desiderio di aderire alla nostra comunit. Questo  basilare, mi sembra. Infatti, nessuno di tutti gli altri stati islamici ha mai espresso un tale desiderio, anzi, nella stragrande maggioranza, ci annienterebbero . I recentissimi avvenimenti ne sono una prova.Chiedendo l'adesione, la Turchia prende nettamente le distanze  da tutti gli altri correligionari , f una scelta di campo coraggiosa e che potr rivelarsi in futuro, molto proficua per tutto il nostro continente..Non lasciamo cadere questa grande occasione, che potrebbe risultare foriera di tante possibile ulteriori strategie geopolitiche e non solo..

Era un veneziano che oppose una strenue resistenza contro un'armata turca:stermin migliaia di nemici ma,alla fine,negozi la resa in cambio di aver salva la vita.  Quando il sovrano turco s'accorse d'aver ceduto all'astuzia del Bragadin(che aveva resistito per settimane con un suo minuscolo manipolo di uomini contro un'intera armata turca),si rimangi la parola data e diede l'ordine di sterminarli tutti,escluso Bragadin.

That don't want to know about Jim& jack from Boston who want to be married, to them it is repugnant, and always will be.  We each have free will and opinion.

Most of them have already turned their backs on God and moral values, even allot of so called conservatives have done so.

If the rest of the world jumped off a bridge  - I guess you would be second in line.  You just refuse to accept reality.  You have to combine world blue states with US blue states to get a majority.  That is so ridiculous I am having a hard time comprehending that.  LIB"RALL's are out of touch with America and that is why you look to Europe for validation.  It is truly sad that you condemn American troops before an investigation and then pander to socialistic & tyrannical nations for approval.  I am glad that you are showing real americans your true colors.  And BTW - consider yourself not welcome here in the deep south.  You most likely know nothing of southerners and our lifestyle.  You most likely don't know that 80% of american troops hale from the southern states.  Please keep exposing your uneducated points  - so that the major southern states needed to win a Presidential Election can see why open minded, highly educated, liberals like you are a disease that is killing America.|`|e53914890a5e259d3fd7b9e12056d6a4aa	Yes you are correct, blue states have more concentrated populations in the cities but to make the assumption that all rednecks are Republicans and vice-versa is sad. Remember Republicans stand for less government, thus any one who doesnt want the government telling him what to do would vote red. The thought about the KKK coming from those areas that vote red is interesting. Looking at history, the Republican and Democrat parties actually switched sides after the 1st world war. Therefore, the area that is now voting red, would possibly have voted blue only 75 years ago.   Also not every red-neck was in the KKK or for that matter, everyone in the now red areas. Its widely know that those who are heard make the impact, thus the KKK members got more publicity than the normal southern neighbor.

Purtroppo non ne hanno indovinata una, la finanziaria  d i s a s t r o s a, le leggi ed i  provvedimenti adottati hanno scontentato tutti, ma la cosa peggiore  che hanno tradito la fiducia di tutti coloro che hanno creduto nel loro programma. Certo, ci sono coloro che viaggiano con il paraocchi da quando sono nati, magari non hanno mai neppure preso in considerazione l'ipotesi di non votare a sinistra, ma fa parte della cultura di un popolo come il nostro: chi non  di sx  un fascista, chi vede canale 5  di dx, come chi va a far la spesa alla Coop  di sx...etc etc. Viviamo in un mondo in cui tutto  politica....purtroppo....  x Klark..  se tu non ti fai condizionare  perch sei uno di quelli con il paraocchi, come si deduce dalle tue parole. Io, invece, mi faccio condizionare e cambio idea a seconda delle azioni e delle parole di chi governa e di chi st all'opposizione....il tuo problema st proprio qui, caro Clark, che tu non vedi oltre il tuo naso...puoi smetterla di comprare tanti giornali, risparmia i soldini, tanto non cambierai mai idea.....|`|02c2243cd6f623ac70368e94af4a981eaa	A parte l'indulto, non sono d'accordo con te.  Il decreto Bersani (provvedimento presente tra l'altro anche nel programma elettorale del Berlusca che ora lo critica)  pi che giusto. La sola modifica che gli apporterei  una forma di tutela verso i commercianti. Nel senso che per un commerciante il famoso TFR (trattamento di fine rapporto)  rappresentato proprio dal valore economico della sua licenza commerciale.  Altre riforme:  La finanziaria non la condivido moltissimo (in particolare non condivido la super tassa per i SUV e la lotta "con i paraocchi" al fisco, sarebbe meglio chiedersi perch i commercianti evadono il fisco) ma la accetto poich  stata imposta dalla comunit europea, non  stata voluta dal governo.  Se proprio vogliamo dirla tutta questa finanziaria  la conseguenza dei disastri fatti dal buon Tremonti. Infatti gi ai tempi del Governo Berlusconi il Parlamento europeo aveva deliberato che l'Italia avrebbe dovuto portare il proprio debito pubblico sotto al 3% entro il 2007.  Poi, siccome la destra europea  molto pi forte della destra italiana, appena andata la sinistra al governo i capoccioni Europei hanno affrettato i tempi per l'Italia, non hanno concesso proroghe ed hanno diffuso la notizia (non ufficialmente ma con opportuni sotterfugi demagogici) che la causa di questa finanziaria  il governo Prodi.  Ma vi pare mai possibile che un governo dopo due mesi che si insediato e dopo non aver approvato alcun provvedimento di carattere finanziario (uscite) abbia potuto portare il debito pubblico del paese oltre la soglia prevista?|`|41f445e38e7cbc13c41167f5924a5327aa	SI|`|bc496853bed3e0dd54bcecb81e909827aa	S.|`|18af157c970f5cdd2e2d5d0943c5ecdcaa	Alcuni provvedimenti sembrano partiti con uno spirito 'giusto', ma purtroppo difettano nell'applicazione.  In generale, direi che i risultati siano MOOOOOLTO al di sotto delle promesse fatte in campagna elettorale, e MOLTO al di sotto delle ragionevoli aspettative dei suoi elettori - ne conosco tanti che oggi negano di aver votato questo governo!    Oltretutto, sembrano ignorare i segnali dell'economia - per esempio, perch una finanziaria da 35 miliardi (sopratutto tasse) dicendo che  per riportare il deficit sotto il 3 %, dicendo che adesso  il 4,3, quando l'ISTAT ha pubblicato i dati del prino semestre (il pi duro) con deficit al 2.9%???    Oltretutto, quanto sembrava essersi messo in moto, pare in fase di frenata, e brusca.....|`|f0b4336f88cccab1c841f4f15ab78ffbaa	Assolutamente no.

Il governo si  appena installato ed anche se Prodi non mi piace (indipendetemente dal suo credo politico) un governo, qualunque esso sia, non pu fare miracoli in pochi mesi. Comunque concordo che l'indulto sia stato uno sbaglio, un grosso ed enorme sbaglio. Sono ancora sotto shock nel vedere che persone come Luigi Chiatti, che ha ucciso 2 bambini, abbia avuto una riduzione di pena di 3 anni! Fosse stato per me, gliene avrei aggiunt altri 3! altro che sconto! Comunque in politica non bisogna avere fretta: i grossi cambiamenti (tutto e subito)  non sono mai buon segno (=dittature). Aristotele insegna che la buona politica  quella che sa prevedere su decenni e che instaura i cambiamenti giusti poco a poco, per limitare i disastri.   Insomma: diamo loro la possibilit di fare. Poi se piantano veramente casino, li rimandiamo a casa.

Premesso che il Berlusca non lo posso digerire,e che ancora litigo con mio padre che ne stravede,dico questo.  In Italia se non eri Comunista o Democristiano non andavi da nessuna partenegli anni 60  Dico 60,perche' il Berlusca parte da li,  Continuo dicendo che quando negli anni 80 si affaccio' nel "panorama" di allora quelli del salotto buono gli risero appresso tipo (man'do va' questo strano tipo??)  La svolta ce l'ha avuta quando la sua volonta' di emergere si sposo' con Bettino Craxi che a sua volta non era ben visto dal salotto buono (vedi Democristiani e Comunisti )  Da allora possiamo dire che ha dimostrato di capire sulle cose di questo strano paese molto di piu' di quelli che hanno sempre avuto in mano le redini del gioco.  Vi basti pensare che le tv che ha le compro da Rizzoli e company che le ritenevano una bufala.Cosi' le hanno date al "pollo" Berlusconi (Man do' va'???)  Dunque da questo punto di vista e' sicuramente meglio di tonnellate di gente  sempre al potere e sempre senza anima e idee.  Dunque poi quanto ha rubato o meno non lo so'ma immagino che un agnellino non sia di certo.  Poi come politico ,diciamo che era ora che andasse a casa.!

President Bush is supporting Israel, so the liberal media is speaking out against the President and Israel's bombing on Lebanon and what not.  I personally think Israel should continue.  It also bothers me that when a suicide bomber blows himself up on an Israeli bus or in a Jewish marketplace (in which the Palestinians are targeting civilians), it is not considered an act of war, but when Israel targets the Palestinian govt its like torturing a baby.

I know NASA has a cable station (or at least they USED to).  My cable provider dropped it - I was disappointed.  It was the greatest "network."

And for a large portion of the day, they would show "live" satellite images of the earth.  No music, no sound, just the EARTH, as the satellite orbited, showing the day side and nite side of earth.

The Israelis say we hate them because they are Jewish, This ultimately untrue.All over history, the Jewish lived among the Muslims and Arabs especially in Palestine without being harmed at all.   Here in Egypt, we have some Jewish Egyptians and no one tries to do them any harm (along as they don't try).  They have all the civilian rights as any other Egyptian citizen.     When you welcome me in your land to live with you in peace and to have all my rights as you as you do (but it's your land) then you find me coming with armies, tanks and planes to kill your son, your wife bombard your town and say the land is mine,  You must hate me.|`|AA10382849	What exactly is a Palestinian again?|`|02aa7a848b73608b8e756268f1517587aa	1)Because they fail where the Israelis succeed  2)The Palestinians have a big chip on their shoulder|`|AA11541126	1. the israelis stole their land 2. they are still there|`|646134c5f6ff5730c02616068f0cdfdeaa	ignorance, they accepted 50 million dollars for the land,yet say it was taken from them.  2nd they lost both wars with them.|`|ca45767916ed793ab0923ccad54c54c9aa	1.

President Bush kept us safe from any further attacks on American soil by terrorists? That may or may not be true, but what is true, he failed us in the one that did matter, so I kind of tend not to put to much credence in the he kept us safe argument.

He really hasn't pushed lots of policy in the past few years.<br>  But, the events in the future will show how he did in the past if you understand what i mean.<br>  <br>  For instance, what if Obama pushed policies that made the USA in a worst position or made a decision to do something in Iraq or elsewhere that was contrary to what Bush's policy was and it ended out being worse. Then Bush would look better.  Or, if it was shown that some secret military operation already captured Osama and they were using him to find more Al Quaeda and later that information became true. Then, maybe he'd look better.  Or, if his insistence on not helping the Big Three turns out to be a good decision for taxpayers ends out the right thing to do (i.e. Chapter 11 bankruptcy for them), then he might get a better regard in the future.<br>  <br>  Just think about Gerald Ford.

E' singolare notare come sui giornali occidentali l'accento sia stato posto sul rifiuto della guerra santa mentre i mullah, riprendendo le critiche del New York Times, hanno condannato la definizione degli elementi innovativi della loro fede come "cose cattive e disumane".

a4e5c45473c1f69e94e4dc7796eed158aa	Bellissima domanda ;)    Il nome ITALIA ci  tramandato fin dal V secolo a. C., quando gi prevaleva su una pleiade di nomi corrispondenti, di varia origine (Espria, Ausnia, Entria, ecc.).     Esso designava allora la penisola calabrese e la vicina costa ionica del Metaponto, ma all'inizio doveva limitarsi a quell'estrema parte della Calabria, che giace a sud dei Golfi di S.Ufmia e di Squillace, oppure, secondo un'altra possibile interpretazione delle fonti, presso a poco all'odierna Campania meridionale (Cilento), tra i Fiumi Sele e Lao.    Antioco di Siracusa (V sec. a. C.) fa derivare tale nome da quello di un re ITALO, che tuttavia  evidentemente leggendario.  Persuade piuttosto una sua derivazione dall'osco "viteliu", nel senso che il territorio fosse ricco di bovini o che il vitello vi rappresentasse un animale sacro.     La forma Italia si spiegherebbe quindi anzitutto con la caduta della "V" iniziale, conseguente alla pronuncia delle genti della Magna Grecia, attraverso le quali essa pass ai Romani.  Alla met del IV secolo a. C. il nome Italia abbraccia il Mezzogiorno continentale a Sud di Paestum, sulla costa tirrenica.    Verso gl'inizi del III secolo esso include la Campania e dopo la Prima Guerra Punica comprende quasi l'intera Penisola, fino all'Arno e all'Esino, allora limiti del dominio romano.|`|a49b35a17e3a59976e39fa0c151cbb3faa	Ho trovato la seguente spiegazione:    "IL NOME DELL'ITALIA  PROBABILMENTE ETRUSCO    L'Autore in primo luogo procede ad esaminare e poi a respingere, come troppo complessa e difettosa, la proposta etimologica che di recente Domenico Silvestri ha fatto del nome dell'Italia. Poi egli riprende e difende la etimologia tradizionale di questo coronimo, che viene riportato al lat. vitulus, umbro vitlu, greco itals. Per egli fa notare che itals  dato da Apollodoro come un appellativo etrusco, il quale trova una conferma in un vocabolo prelatino della Sardegna, bttalu ?vitellino?. Conclude facendo osservare che lo stretto contatto che da secoli esisteva tra gli Etruschi da una parte ed i popoli Italici dall'altra rende molto pi probabile o verosimile l'ipotesi che siano stati appunto gli Etruschi a dare quel nome agli Italici e non i Greci."

Significa, dopo il Sacco di Roma, il Sommo Pontefice d'allora ha scrito un concordato col cantone svizzero per mandamento di soldati a pagamento, un concordato che segue in vigore ancor'oggi. Pero, nonostante la presenza dei svizzeri per la sicurezza interna del Vaticano secondo il Tratato Lateranense e dopo la Legge fondamentale dello Stato della Citta di Vaticano ci badano le forze dell'ordine della Repubblica Italia(polizia/carabinieri). Oltre questo, in caso di guerra il Sommo Pontefice potra atraverso modi diplomatici chiedere aiuto in uomini ed arme degli stati catolici. Significa, soltanto le guardie svizzere si, ma soltanto in tempo di pace e non soli.  Ti saluto,  MARINA|`|18af157c970f5cdd2e2d5d0943c5ecdcaa	Ognuno fa le dichiarazioni che  in grado di fare.

One's intentions, habbits or tendencies are never on trial - only one's actions.  You could want to kill every person you've ever met but until you do kill someone there is not a damned thing the law can do about it.    With an exception:  If you are so mentally ill that you are a danger to others, you can be forced to undergo treatment.  You can also be found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity.  Even so, "homicidal tendencies" isnt a real psychiatric diagnosis.  You'd be schizophrenic or have a borderline personality disorder or something like that.  But if your delusional state made you likely to kill, you could be hospitalized against your will.|`|AA10914642	Not a legal term but a medical and psychological term.

Kind of like Mexico.<br>  the super rich and the super poor.<br>  Clinton balanced the budget, put everyone to work and kept us out of war.

All of those tissues were considered "alive" and yet I do not support bans on masturbation, contraception, or abortion. <br>  <br>  Abortion is a gray area. Nobody can deny that. I think that embryos are potential lives in a similar way that sperm and eggs are potential lives. The degrees of separation between the two are minute. Only when you get close to the last trimester of pregnancy do we see the development of a human being come to fruition. <br>  <br>  To overturn Roe v. Wade would invite the government to decide my medical care. Since the most effective forms of contraception (pill, IUD) have secondary effects of preventing implantation of a fertilized egg, any popular law that defines a fertilized egg as a person (the pro-life goal) would ban most forms of contraception - specifically the most effective ones (hormonal) that are in complete control of the woman. No surprise. <br>  <br>  I use an IUD (99.9% effectiveness) and many of those who are pro-life don't like that because it changes the lining of the uterus. They oppose the very thing that practically insures that I would never get an abortion.<br>  <br>  There was even a risk of the contraceptive ban with one anti-abortion ballot measure in Colorado that failed to pass this November. Fundamentalists videotaped women going into a Planned Parenthood contraceptive clinic near my home. The place didn't even do abortions, yet the patients who went there got harassed. <br>  <br>  Sorry but get the government out of my health care! The Republicans are hypocritical on this - they say they want limited government and yet they skimp on the abortion / contraception issue because of religion.|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	to the poster gosam777 you are completely wrong...60% of abortions are obtained by white women|`|fh12fkNWaa	I hope not.

My mom forced me to have an abortion and none of them wanted to help THEN.|`|e52Wy71Laa	"pro-choice" is usually constrained to mean that one is against banning abortions.  It does not mean you think abortions are a good thing.<br>  <br>  Similarly, "pro-life" does not mean you're in favor of keeping everything alive.  Most who self-identify as "pro-lfe" understand there are even some circumstances where an abortion is, albeit with great regret on all sides, the appropriate decision.<br>  <br>  This is the problem with binary labelling.  People aren't transistors.|`|vJzSDNWkaa	my dad refers to pro choice as pro abortion, if you have no problem with someone else having an abortion you are for abortion.

It is a human life, if life ends when your heart stops beating that means your life starts when the heart starts beating and it starts beating inside the womb, its a selfish and barbaric act to have an abortion.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	No.  Pro choice in personal matters means mind your own business.|`|AA11711276	Nice try.

AA10268547	One you never lie, period,      You can tell her you have discussed the matter with her parents|`|AA10091182	Children are incompetent - period.  They cannot make informed health care decisions by definition.  They are as incompetent as people who are psychotic or comatose.  That's just the law.    Parents of children, therefore, hold their children's rights.  The parents are the patient.  The parents must be informed; the parents must have access to the medical records; the parents must be allowed to make decisions.  If the parents don't want the child told, the child must not be told.    And you are breaking no ethical guideline by abiding by the parent's wishes.    It doesn't mean you can't talk to the parents and ask them to reconsider, but be prepared to have your opinions ignored.  And if you tell the child against the parents' wishes, be prepared to be unemployed.

WmiUUmWxaa	First of all, ask yourself what you really want to do in the military.  Your choice of MOS (or rate) determines what you will actually be doing on a day to day basis, and thus is your most important decision.  Secondly, which branch of service is likely to accommodate that job choice?  Everything being equal; I would say go Air Force for computers, Navy for firefighting.  However, keep in mind that the Air Force is in the process of downsizing its personnel strength; you may not be able to get an IT job in your contract.  By all means, go to recruiters from both branches; let them both know that you are considering the other service; this works in your favor because each recruiter will then compete for your enlistment and offer you more of what you want (bonus, JOB, schools, etc.)  Just do your research and you'll be fine.  Good luck.|`|651026ed93d3a8cc465459add690e982aa	USN  !!!  Everyone needs to know everything to keep the ship afloat.

You job is to save the ship in any mean possible, you will require to do a lot of fire fighting similar to real fire fighter.  To save a ship is perhaps one most important task of Navy.  Also damage control is easy to get in, require low asvab score, if you are smart.  You probably easily outscore other in testing.  As for computer, navy offer that as well.  But i think airforce is the way to go in technology. Fire fighting and Computer are very different field, one require lots of physical working in very hot environment, other one require countless hour spend on the computer.|`|sOpIMeJSaa	If want to go into fire fighting join the Navy, There is always ships are burning in war.

His lie that taxes will not go up is just him blowing smoke up your a**.  He will be letting the tax cuts everyone got from Bush expire next year, can you say tax increase.  This year he is going to cut our taxes if we make less than $250,000 per year.  Oh wait that was last week this week it is down to $100,000 per year.  What will it add up to a whoppin $13 per week extra on your pay check starting in June and ending in December.  He has already more than doubled the deficit left to him by Bush.  He did that in less than a month.  He plans to spend even more.  The only way he can continue to spend in this fashion and not raise taxes is by running the printing presses full time and making the dollar worth less and less at every turn. This process is better known as inflation.  He will also borrow money from China and other countries completely disregarding the fact that borrowed money must not only be paid back it must be paid back with interest.

Next, they were asked, “Which of the following statements most closely reflects Barack Obama's position on abortion?” 29% said he took the pro-choice position (12%  for any reason or circumstance but only before the first 3 months of pregnancy, 7%  for any reason or circumstance but only before the first 6 months of pregnancy, 10% at any time or reason), 20% said he took the pro-life position (4% illegal in ALL situations, 6% legal only to save the life of the mother, 10% rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother), and 49% of them said they didn't even know! Barack Obama's actual position on abortion is that it should be legal at any time during the pregnancy for any reason and that the choice is up to the mother, yet, only 10% (the people who voted that he believed it should be legal at any time or any reason) of the people knew where Obama stands on abortion. That's scary. People are voting for him when a mere 10% of them actually know his position on this!<br>   Senator Barack Obama voted against letting people use a self defense argument, which is voting against the second amendment. So basically, he believes if someone is threatening to take your life, that you have no right to defend yourself with arms.<br>   On Barack Obama's official website, it says this: “He has never been a Muslim, was not raised as a Muslim, and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ.” Yet he admits that in 1978, he was registered as a Muslim at Catholic Primary school where he learned to recite Muslim prayers, read Arabic, and read the Quaran. He also admits that his father was a Muslim and died as a Muslim and his brother is still a committed Muslim. So contrary to what he says on his website, he was raised as a Muslim. It's one thing to just grow up as a Muslim, but another to grow up as a Muslim and then lie and try to cover it up. He also believes that evolution is perfectly compatible with the Christian faith. He also says that prayer cannot prevent disasters, but policy can handle them. He doesn't know if there is life after death, but that we should focus on our life here on earth. And he says he's a committed Christian??? What kind of church is he going to? On June 28, 2006, he arrogantly gave a sarcastic speech, mocking and ridiculing the Bible, saying, “Which passages of scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery's okay? Or we could go with Deuteronomy which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just go with the Sermon on the mount, a passage so radical, that it's doubtful that our own defense department could survive it's application. Folks haven't been reading their Bible.” First of all, Jesus would never, in any occasion, advise turning the other cheek to terrorists and enemies as Obama inferred.<br>   When giving a speech against war, Obama claimed his grandfather had fought in a war and witnessed innocent soldiers die around him. Then later in a different speech, he claimed his grandfather never faced combat. Yet another contradiction.<br>  <br>  Or if you don't wanna read all that, just watch this, it's only about a minute or two: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/swf/l.swf?video_id=4FCNKwHRCQM&rel=1&eurl=http%3A//us.mc346.mail.yahoo.com/mc/showMessage%3Ffid%3DInbox%26sort%3Ddate%26order%3Ddown%26startMid%3D0%26.rand%3D852689011%26&iurl=http%3A//i1.ytimg.com/vi/4FCNKwHRCQM/default.jpg&t=OEgsToPDskIgiIZQzuJvcLy54KAbBNMi&use_get_video_info=1&load_modules=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/swf/l.swf?video_i...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OR JUST READ THIS: it's an article from the parade magazine when you can't decide who to vote:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parade.com/news/2008/11/what-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.parade.com/news/2008/11/what-...</a> <br>  <br>  Here's Obama at a glance:<br>  1.

So, if you are counting on Obama to lower the prices of automobiles, it just will not happen. <br>  <br>  But, you need to realize that the cost of labor, the parts, the benefits for the UAW workers, the liability costs, and the costs to manufacture and market the parts will always need to be factored in to the sticker price of a vehicle. 
EjX9p9dBaa	The short answer is because if they fail hundreds of thousands will be out of a job.  <br>  <br>  While I agree a bail out is unfair to the American Tax payers since these same companies just 3-5 years ago were turning record profits.  The main question is where did the profits go?  The answer is many places.  Many time those profits are reinvested into new factories, buildings, research and so on. <br>  <br>  However some of these companies were also giving out hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to the top executive.  Was this justifiable?  My answer is no.  This money could have been put into reserve, since these CEO's didn't really do anything to raise these profits, it was the American Economy that did it.<br>  <br>  So now its a catch 22, do you let these major compaines fail and risk the jobs and lively hood of eventual millions of people, or do you step in and given them cash to keep their head above water until things settle down, which could be upwards of 5-6 years.  While I don't think its fair the government give companies money it is needed.  There should be guidelines though such as:<br>  <br>  a.  No company should issue bonuses in excess of 'x' amount to their employees.  Persons making more than 'y' amount are not eligible for bonuses until the company is able to post two consecutive profitable quaters.  Then the 'x' amount comes into play.<br>  b.  For every profitable quarter the company shall pay back the government 'z'% of profits until bail out money is repaid in full.  If a company is sold or bought out by another, the bail out money is still to be repaid by new company.<br>  c.  Every company receiving money must submit a plan of action detailing how they plan to turn themselves around.  In the case of the Auto industry smaller, more reliable cars.  In the banking industry, no more subprime mortages or 100% fiancing.<br>  <br>  If the government is going to give these companies billions, we need to hold them accountable for it otherwise our children will have to figure out how to repay they debt we have incurred cause of our selfiness.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	You have no idea how many jobs are connected with this problem. Man we are screwed.|`|BUS5PJEmaa	I do not agree with the bail out...but if the big three go out of business it is going to be a snowball effect. There are a lot of companies who have the big three as a customer...they will all go under....having that many employees out of work is going to cause a lot of businesses to have less customers...it is a mess and I do not think a bail out is going to fix it...just prolong it. |`|pOJ8G7Sgaa	The government thinks it's gonna make a damn difference if it has a stake in the companies.

Merry Christmas citizens.|`|7708f35ffa2cf7f984891812e17158beaa	The only reason for any sort of bailout or stimulus is to keep everybody, you, me, Joe the plumber, every single one of us from going absolutely broke.  We can all whine that it's not fair to bail out anyone.  That's true, but standing in line at a soup kitchen isn't particularly fair either.<br>  <br>  I really think that to get the economy jump started the government ought to give us all merchandise stamps that would expire in 60 days or so if unused.  That would require consumers to buy stuff as opposed to sticking money in their pockets or paying off bills.  |`|IvBS6A3saa	The bailout isn't really supposed to make anyone richer - its just supposed to keep some of these large enterprises around which our society is built, from going bankrupt and having to shut down.  So for example, if we don't bailout the automakers, there won't be any more American-made cars.  If we don't bail out the banks, there won't be any more loans for houses, cars, etc.<br>  <br>  Now personally, I don't think that would be so bad.  Foreign cars are better and more gas-efficient, but then we would be further exasperating the trade deficit.  But then again, I don't even own a car so I wouldn't be contributing to that particular deficit.  Car loans are stupid because they allow people to spend way beyond their means.  If you can't afford $3000 for a clunker to get you to work, then you should consider the bus instead.  As for houses, if mortgage loans weren't so common, then the prices of houses would naturally have to go down since no one would be able to buy them otherwise.  That means that I would actually have an honest chance of saving up enough cash to buy a home straight-up without indenturing myself to the bank for 30 years.<br>  <br>  But, for the average American, these great bastions of capitalist culture are pretty essential.|`|802fa4cee6078e0848fb0b6e38ab9281aa	The UK. have been doing that for the last four hundred years in the guise of the monarchy, and you Americans are always telling us how wonderful they are, and what a good job they do, but you don't have to pay for them|`|jAYGIpkqaa	Because we already have millions of ppl not working we don't need to times that by 4.

23ef85bcc8cb1abbea5add6459af5914aa	Credo che molti lo facciano solo per presa di posizione. Forse qualcuno ritiene che le multinazionali monopolizzino i mercati e simboleggino lo sfruttamento operaio. In parte pu essere vero, ma dall'altro verso bisogna dire che comunque portano lavoro, tecnologie e competenze in paesi attualmenti sottosviluppati, per i quali comunque, al momento, l'unica speranza di evoluzione futura  apprendere tali tecnologie tecnologie e conoscenze proprio da queste aziende, anche se attualmente il costo, in termini di sacrificio,  decisamente alto. Di certo, visto l'enorme potere economico e politico che hanno le multinazionali, potrebbero, volendo, ridurre buona parte della vera povert e disagio sociale che esiste al mondo, ma questo le portebbe automaticamente a perdere potere e, sinceramente, non ho mai visto nessuno agire nel proprio disinteresse, a prescindere dalla posizione politica, sociale o lavorativa che occupi. Credo che se si analizzano i diversi rami in cui opera una multinazionale, non se ne possa escludere nemmeno una per un operato completamente integro dal punto di vista morale, quindi fare preferenze o condannare l'una piuttosto che l'altra sembra decisamente assurdo.|`|e3eaf2a0cd784c2198a12494f792286baa	generalmente (parlo del mio caso) le multinazionali odiate sono quelle che non rispettano un certo codice etico...  ...ti spiego cosa intendo...  prendiamo il caso Nestl: la suddetta, negli anni passati si  messa a dare alle popolazioni di alcuni paesi del 3 mondo (ad esempio Africa e India) latte in polvere...il problema  che cosi facendo si disabituavano le donne ad allattare i propri figli..oltre a farne un grande business,il latte in polvere  notoriamente meno nutritivo di quello materno, con le conseguenze che ti lascio immaginare...    altri casi eclatanti sono la Nike, che in passato produceva i propri prodotti nei soliti paesi del 3 Mondo, sfruttando i lavoratori locali che naturalmente pretendevano uno stipendio minore e generalmente non sono rappresentati da nessun sindacato...comunque mi pare che la Nike abbia ufficialmente smesso di fare cio...    per quanto riguarda la FIAT, mi pare non sia mai stata accusata di avere comportamenti di questo tipo, per cui non vedo il motivo per odiarla...    spero di essere stato chiaro, e di non aver detto cose non vere....se fosse cosi correggetemi...    ...ciao|`|ee710dbf2948027d9de880d0dcaef3a4aa	perch sfruttano i bambini e altre povere persone pagandole 5 cent al giorno! io vedo buoni motivi per odiarle|`|21804472ce1df1001e925edb96ef8e66aa	il problema  molto pi semplice, boicottano solo quelle dove c' di mezzo l'America|`|dcb88358944f2c16dd350ef3a90a3a38aa	chi boicotta, spesso tralascia altre condizioni...condivido!|`|7f3ea27e29daa0785e1b94d20105aa2eaa	Hai ragione, la gente manca di coerenza.|`|34feca8bb7714ba50de2afea1d397693aa	Perch prevalentemente prosperano sfruttando risorse di paesi altrui,tipico  il Sudamerica colonializzato dalle multinazionali USA.Ciao|`|3fc594a21f6908f36a8349fee00ecb34aa	allora..  cercher di spiegarti il mio punto di vista...  allora..la Nestl sta mandando prodotti avariati o non sicuri a popolazioni di paesi sottosviluppati cn gi molti problemi..  il Mc invece fa danni all'organismo cn i suoi cibi..pieni di sale..poca verdura troppa carne scadenta..ke cosa vuoi ke le persone siano concordi a un processo di auto didtruzione..?  fammi sapere se mi sono spiegata..  baci|`|669441c5d3f689c1acd2daeb1259151daa	qua secondo me, non  un problema di multinazionali.

Questo  il vero problema!|`|997bcf599da940f529771fa9825333eeaa	posso provare a risponderti...  le multinazionali sono imprese di grandissima dimensione che spostano alcune aziende all'estero per avere costi minori. I costi minori non sono per dati solo dal minor costo della materia prima, ma anche della manodopera, per assenza in questi paesi, spesso poverissimi, di normative e sanzioni in tema di lavoro, occupazione, diritti del lavoratore, ecc. Quindi se in italia dei per forza pagare un operaio tot e non farlo lavorare pi di tot ore al giorno, e pagargli tredicesima, quattordicesima, contributi ecc, in Indocina, Corea, ecc lo puoi page molto di meno e sfruttarlo molto di pi perch non ci sono sanzioni, e se ci sono non sono applicate.   Sia ben chiaro che la mia  solo una spiegazione, senza alcun connotato politico o di parte.|`|753a92ba4629dbef6a9ad12facfb1726aa	Sulla fiat onestamente non ho mai sentito niente, riguardo alla nestl puoi ampiamente documentarti su internet sullo schifo che fanno nel terzo mondo col latte in polvere, la Nike e molte altre fanno lavorare bambini nei paesi poveri sottopagandoli   a quanto dicono.

A proposito ora che ricordo sulla fiat avevo sentito che vendevano  i furgoni in certi paesi che li usavano per eseguire le pene capitali anche se pu sembrare ridicolo il fatto che lo facessero nei furgoni.

No one else on Earth has as big a military, nor spends as much on their military than America does.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But if you mean how we help others, Japan actually beats us on that point.

T8nap2Pnaa	Actually, since you won't be filing an I-864 for a fiance visa, you may not have to show direct income at all. The officer can make a decision without requiring the affidavit. However, if  he decides he needs one, he can't ask for the I-864, and can only request the I-134, and for that you don't have to show an income of 125% over the poverty guideline, or $17,500, but only 100% or $14,000. But, when she arrives in the US and you file the immigrant visa petition, then you will have to file an I-864 and show an income of $17,500 when your spouse adjusts to immigrant status. But, since she'll have a work permit, any income she has will also be counted. |`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	2 people, just your and her..... $17,500 for 2008.<br>  |`|KO5gd52Aaa	It's not based on the country of the foreign immigrant but based on the Federal Poverty Level for the number of people in the sponsoring US citizen's house, including the intending immigrant.<br>  <br>  You must earn (or have assets of 5x the value) over 125% of this level.

b9b714c20b15275fbe86f06a0f4f5372aa	I think that at this point in the evolution of the government and the American people, that the electoral voting system should be retired.  The system was put in place by early Americans because of the lack of education and understanding of politics.  In today's world, more people are educated and have a good understanding of politics.  Why insult these intelligent Americans with this outdated voting system?  It is surprising that in a world of such advanced technology that the American people have such an outdated way of voting.  If this system were to be changed, people would have more confidence in their vote and take part in elections more so than now.  The American people do not see the need to vote if the elections are only going to be based on a percentage of people that they are not even part of.  If the elections were based on the votes of each individual person, they would be more accurate and show what the American people really want.  If the American people saw that their vote really did make a difference, they would have a renowned interest in their government and local community and also be more willing to stand up and vote for what they think is right.|`|AA11436949	This question pokes at the heart of the difference between a democracy and a representative republic and nibbles at the edges of notions of sovereignty.    In a true democracy, all individuals in the polity would share in every decision of state. In the modern nation-state, this would be impossibly unwieldy and would require every citizen to be a full time legislator (not to mention the difficulties of disseminating information and calculating voting results).     The founders believed that a representative democracy was the best form of government achievable for a nation, which was considered something of a novel and naive idea at the time. In a representative democracy, the people elect leaders or representatives to handle the day-to-day job of governance. Periodically, elections are held to allow the people to express approval or disapproval of their representatives by returning them to office or voting them out.    The office of President of the United States, the singular embodiment of the executive power of the federal government, was considered to potent a position to be entrusted to direct election of the people. While a Virginian might be expected to be familiar with the leaders of his state, those that might stand for election as representatives, the United States as a whole was thought to be too large for most people to be familiar with that smaller body of people who would likely stand for election as President. Therefore, the founders established a college of electors, people directly elected in each state who might be expected to make the effort to familiarize themselves with the national candidates for President. These electors would then gather and choose the President.    The power to govern how electors were selected was entrusted to the legislatures of the various states. This goes to the question of sovereignty under the Federal Constitution. The federal government should be viewed as a government of sovereign states, and not necessarily of individual citizens. The states cede some of their sovereign power to the federal government, and are in turn directly represented in the federal government. Individuals are presumed to be directly represented at the state level, where individual liberties or sovereignty is ceded to the police power of the state. Thus, it seemed natural to the founders that the states ought to be the basic unit represented in the gathering of presidential electors, not individual citizens who were believed to be better represented at the state level.    Unfortunately, the concept of how truly limited the power of the federal government is has become muddled over time, predominantly by the aggregation of wealth in the federal system and an extremely expansive reading of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Presidential elections should serve as a reminder of how remote the federal executive is from the people and be a warning to citizens that the federal government does not directly represent them and should be treated with appropriate scepticism and wariness. Changing the presidential electoral system might be a misstep down a path leading to the aggregation of greater power at the federal level; the very outcome greatly feared by most of the founders.|`|AA11766242	A lot of people complain about the electoral college...it's an old holdover from way-back, some people don't even vote for a presidential candidate because they assume that the electoral college will do largly whatver it wants. What's your proposal for distilling the will of the people off of paper ballots and doing so honestly, and effectively?|`|ab4b2738b2b37798f78e62df03413ae6aa	The electoral college as it is called was a good idea when first used because of the area that the US covered was quite large and there was no way to count all of the votes in a timely manner. I believe that this system is very out dated and should be replaced by simply using the computer technology we have to count the popular vote. This can be done almost instantly.   This will, however, never happen because the politicians already in power have, over the years, learned to manipulate voting district boundaries to help insure that they, the imcumbants, remain in office.
AA10268547	no,  you don't post bail for a speeding ticket unless the person who got it is in jail,  bail is money to get someone out of jail,  and the people at the jail can take it.    if it is just the fine, you have to wait till the court house is open.|`|AA10783313	maybe you could write a check and mail it,, or buy a money order if it's overdue,,|`|AA11535413	Google your nearst DMV and enter your plate number. It will show exactly how much you owe them. You can pay it electronically. My friend does this ALL the time.   You can also mail them the check. Check your ticket, there should be envelope with mailing address there.|`|AA11195243	you are using the term bail when what you really mean is bond. You want to post bond on this ticket,     Your ticket has a court date on it, which is a due date when the ticket has to be paid or a bond posted equal to the amount of the ticket cost, at which point your case will be put on that days court docket to be heard. On a ticket issued by city police, bond is posted at the traffic counter, most are posted just prior to going to the court date on the ticket.      In that court proceeding, you will have the oppurtunity to enter a guilty, not guilty or no contest plea. If you plead guilty or no contest, you can then give the court some explaination of midigating circumstances and ask for a reduced fine or perhaps be eligiable to attend some driver improvment class. Keep in mind though, even though you have posted bond in the amount of the ticket, if you go before the judge; you will also be assest court cost.     Remember, this appearance is a hearing and not a trial so, if you have pleaded guilty or no-contest, you can not challenge the validity of the ticket just give midigating circumstances.     For example say you got a ticket for an expired tag. You can go in and plead guilty but, show that the judge that since recieving the ticket you have brought the tag up to date, and ask the judge to reduce the fine.    Should you elect to enter a plea of not guilty, you will be given a trial date. At that proceeding, you can bring witness and also question the cities witness. (the police officer)  At the conclusion the judge will issue either a guilty or not guilty verdict and tell you what the fine is plus court cost.     If you have missed the court date set on the ticket, you still have, in my municality, until midnight of that due date to pay the ticket without having additional cost assessed. Also, within my municipality, a warrent is not issued the day of the due date on the ticket, it actually takes about a week. Nevertheless, the cost of the ticket still goes up, if not paid by midnight of the due date.     Additionally, if the date of the court date (the due date) on the ticket was for today. You can still go in and post a bond at a later date and still have all the above mentioned options available to you. Namely, you can plead guilty and ask the judge to reduce the cost back down to it's original amount. Something he might do, if you come to him quickly.    Once again, if your ticket was issued by a city police officer you post your bond at the TRAFFIC COUNTER and your case is heard by the CITY JUDGE IN CITY COURT (AKA Municipal Court) and     if your ticket was issued by a county sheriff or a state police (Highway Patrol) then the same proceedure takes place however, you post your bond with the COURT CLERKS OFFICE and your case is heard in district court located at the COUNTY COURTHOUSE    **post script: Rest assured if you missed your court date today. They are not going to come pick you up at your house over the weekend. However, you are at some risk , if you get pulled over of being taken to jail and held until you post bond on the ticket.     In that case, it is like bail and it could be said that you were bailed out of jail by posting bond on the ticket. But, I would bet you a dime to a dollar that if you got pulled over tonight, you would come back clear w/o wants or warrents. So don't let it ruin your weekend. Just get it cleaned up on Monday. It is going to be OK.|`|AA11286264	yes u should be able to go to your local police and pay your fine

AA10487240	I'd assume in order to sue them you'd have to prove they actually have put your family at risk.  If that's the case you could sue the VA for losing those veterns files even though they were returned.  It seems the goverment is the one who should be addressing what they've implied is a threat to "national security".  It's yet to be proven this was actually a threat aprart from the comments from a few goverment officials.  If you recall they made the same accusation with the first leak and did nothing.  So if it's true that the New York Times has repeatedly put us at risk prove it and do something about it.  It seems like more of that double speak regarding the "war on terror".  We are at war, we need special tools not provided by the current laws but it's a good idea to turn port management over to the UAE.  The New York Times has threatened our national security more then once and the Adminstration has yet to censure them with even a suspension of press credentials ?  I have to wonder if they believe it themselves and if it's not more dodge and weave.  Not to mention if the legality of the program could be challenged you can't classify an illegal program legally ?  It's a good question I wonder that myself.  I've added a link with some other headlines the times have run that really are more damming then this one it is a bit satrical.|`|161b3ed2ddfbf7be945d795b10fa8ca3aa	Of course.  This is the United States.  You can sue anyone for anything.  I can sue you for asking that question.  If you want to know if there is a chance of succeeding, the proper questions are:   Do you have the money to finance this?  Unless there is a good chance of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, no attorney is going to undertake this on contingency.  That being said, and not really knowing the details - Contact Millberg, Weiss in NYC as they have been very successful with lots of class action suits.  There are also many other law firms that specialize in class action suits.  The next question is what are your damages?  How were you and your family injured (and for a class action, how were the other members of the class injured)?  Who is the "class" or is it really an individual suit?  The first amendment is really tough to get around.  What/how did the NY Times do anything it did not have a right to do?  Were there actual damages or are they speculative?  The list goes on.|`|AA11649532	It's a possibility but you need to remember that the 1st amendment defends their right.  what you need to prove is how they acquired the story in the first place and then sue the source.|`|AA10091182	No.

Besides, a lot of the Palistinians were going into Israel, and doing suicide bombings of Pizza places, and public buses.  Israel did not do those things. They went after those who were funding it.  They did their best not to get anyone else hurt in attacks.|`|7131a9419d1dbb80a755fb39ec8bc797aa	It depends.  Is country B philosophically denying the right of country A to exist?  Is country B completely opposed to any sort of peace between it and country A?      I can't give you a more definitive answer without more details.|`|ecc1ca5e4472ef740804908cb9c0571caa	Why do I feel like I am being manipulated into supporting country B? Am I supposed to feel sorry for country B and support it because I want to be a nice person?     Politics is not a beauty contest. It is not about who is nicer or sweeter. Politics is about who gets what and how much of it. As country C, I would support country A, if country A has to offer me something I want in exchange for my support and more of it then country B.   I would support country B if it can give me something I want and more of it then country A. However, there is an extra scenario under which I would support country B: if I have reasons to believe that country A, by winning against country B, would become strong enough to attack me. Then I would help country B to prevent country A from becoming a threat to me. And I would do it for free.    This is how politics is played. It is not about niceties and touchy feelings. Take the scenarios above and see whether it fits the real life scenario you are referring to. By the way, if country B cannot find a country C to help them out, and they are alone, it would be rational for country B to not piss off country A too much. They might be able to make it.

Accept that there will be civilian casualties and just refuse to negotiate.<br>  <br>  The second step is to arm ALL ships of value traveling through the area so that they think twice about attacking.

If you are not eligible for re-hire, it can hurt you terribly in your career. Move to a better company where people are rewarded for their work and not the color of their skin. Do not compromise your quality of life or standards for those who discriminate.

09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	Well of course, the U.N. is simply yet another instrument in the horrible orchestra of the West.  It is against anyone who tries to resist the West's so-called power.  So, since so much of the West has invested in and has been religiously aligned with Israel from the beginning of that country (i.e. the invasion of Palestine) to the present, there's a low chance that they'll stop supporting Israel even if they do this.  Indeed, they will turn their heads away from the massacre of the Lebanese by Israeli terrorists, because perhaps Lebanon is worth less than Israel in the eyes of the U.N. and the rest of the West.  It's very unfortunate.

There has been some strategic planing in the works by our own countries wealthy ruling class whom does not have the majority "working class" best interest at hand instead just their own self interest or profit! All the more reasons why if USA is the regain super power status we must lead by showing the rest other world the majority can rule and take control of Money/Power/Wealth.

Depending on your state laws, and if they have not been in touch since the repo of your car, they may not have a case.  After all they got the car.  They would have had to inform you shortly after taking the car (my opinion, and I am not a lawyer, just rather savvy with this kind of stuff)  There are free services where you can ask about things like that.  I would be inclined to tell them to take a hike, but that's me.  I don't take guff from anyone.   ;-)|`|AA11098822	First...so sorry about your daughter..I hope she is ok now.

Why don't you contact an attorney...almost all (the good ones anyway) will give you a free first consultation..so you can at least get started for free.

Per assassini si dovrebbe valutare meglio ogni volta che una a finito la pena.. In tanti altri paesi lo fanno . In Italia a nessuno non frega niente.

ffkIisYwaa	Short answer yes.    Enlist for 18X.  You will go to One Station Unit Training for 11B (OSUT for Infantry)  Attend Airborne School  Attend Special Forces Qualification Course  Then select a Special Forces job that you qualify for   Attend School and language training for your job and team's area oreintation    If you fail at any point in this pipeline to joining the special forces  YOU WILL SERVE THE REMAINDER OF YOUR CONTRACT IN THE INFANTRY    GOOD LUCK  here is the link  http://usmilitary.about.com/od/enlistedj...|`|0szdPqI0aa	yes. the 18x program is the special forces enlistment option.  you have to be 20 years old to apply for this though.  but you go to basic training, then a very quick  infantry training, then airborne, then you begin special forces training.  i do not recommend this though. majority of those who fail SF training came from this contract. the reason is because they haven't honed their soldiering skills all the well. they haven't proved themselves in combat, they do not know what being a regular infantryman alone is like. they are just not as prepared as people who are already serving.|`|S55mhoSgaa	if ur a civillian, then u can take the 18x and TRY to get in. You go to a school to get prepared for like a month then go do the SFAS and then SFQC and if u make it thru, u might get into special forces. If ur an officer in the army, u have to be a captain to try for selection. I don't know about enlisted, but i think its the same as a civillian except without the school.    on the website link(go army) , it says that the army is recruiting civillians for SF, meaning u dont have to have served.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	I've read a couple things that you can now enlist for them.

Special Forces is normally for experienced soldiers taking a further step up the warrior path, so only very tough civilians will manage to pass first time....meaning, as 18X failures must then spend the rest of their contract as 11B, 11B is getting filled up pretty easy compared to before this MOS existed.

Just for a little while, let me struggle with that dilemma.|`|wsTK80H6aa	Taking from the rich and giving to the poor is a great idea for a story, but we have this ideal of the American Dream in our great country. "All men are created equal" that is unless you're rich because then you have to take care of your equals. ANYONE can pull themselves out of poverty, but it takes sacrifices that many people are not willing make. Sometimes you have to relocate to an area where success is more likely. You have to have a work ethic that is better than the norm. You can't live you life by your vices. It takes hard work, but anyone in America can be a success. But, a new thing in our society is to look down upon anyone that achieves the American Dream as an elitist.    We HAVE become a nation of whiners. A nation filled with people that think it is the duty of the rich to take care of them. If we want an aristocracy of the Lords taking care of their serfs, then we should have never fought the Revolution. We are becoming a nation of people that want to be taken care of by the government from the cradle to the grave and it is a sad day.    My family origins are in the Ozark Mountains, so I came from a line of extreme poverty.

There is an obnoxious questioner on Y/A who has been making mocking references to his name in various insulting forms for months now and his questions are equally fear mongeringly stupid.  and, yes, racist.

That has been broadcasted and substantiated as a fact. This proves that Obama is not offended by racial slurs against white people, since he sat for 20 years hearing them from the pulpit and never did it offend him enough to leave the church.

He was born to a governor and his mother was the daughter of a senator ... so, aristocrat, sure, but not really royalty.  At 17 he joined the army and rose through the ranks as optio, centurion, and then as primus pilus of the First Cohort under General Lucius Veras.

If you are at an OSUT duty station, you will only have one graduation at the end of AIT.  The only ones who have two graduations are the companies that are for split option soldiers who basically go for one summer to BCT, then another for AIT.  Any non split option soldiers in those companies will get two graduations because they will do the graduation ceremony along with their split option counterparts, but on the whole, most soldiers will not do two.    I went to Fort Leonardwood in 2005 as an MP and the transition from BCT to AIT was "Congratulations on finishing BCT... welcome to AIT" with not a blink in between.    In short, if his company is primarily made of split option recruits, then he will more than likely have a graduation and family day celebration, but if not, then there will not be one until AIT.

While manslaugter is generally the act that is not intended, nor premeditated that results in death.    Could he claim it in court, and IMO would it help? Possibly. It would depend very much on the evidence and the jury.

ImgouTRIaa	I was wondering when , not if , this question would come up! Yeah! I'm betting that's just the case! The Hillary supporters must be positively cringing at the sight of Sarah. Really, Hillary is the more experienced of the 2 women, and COULD HAVE  been still on the ballot if she conceded to her ego that Obama was the man to put in the   white House first ,over her, as a woman, and she would have taken the V.P. ticket to keep the Big Picture afloat. But her ego, being what it is, tore that ticket apart.I have to  say also, Fair Hillary's meanspiritedness in the game diminished her image in my eyes, and Sarah , not well versed in matters of the world, but smart enough not to go the Hillary/***** route, uses her congeniality, charm  and good looks to woo the masses , and why not? If Hillary can come out screaming , wailing and generating  misery, ADDING TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF NOT LOOKING AS GOOD AS SARAH, what's to be expected? Had she come out as a lady ,demure and charming, but effective,(and that can be done), she could well still be in the lead, at least from my perspective.The women in my family were positively livid when Sarah was announced for the McCain ticket , and looks were a deciding factor in their venom. The women said " all us men were going to vote for her on account of "THE *** FACTOR" ,  just because she is a bona fide cutie, and to an extent ,we might be inclined to listen to what she says, as she already has us LOOKING!! But after the  initial WOW!! ,and we have to deal with the realities of the day to day workweek and Sarah might be out there "cratering" in foreign affairs, and have to vote responsibly.Oh yeah , the girls really get their hate on when the cutie shows up. Pretty stupid, huh?|`|XgRoej8Baa	Yeah they're jealous  No good lipstick wearing sl utt...|`|e5c88ebcd3636e101469ad7c3922f29eaa	No, i wont vote for her because she's dumb as a doorknob..|`|i9if59BGaa	There are lots of women I would vote for just not Palin.

May I ask you a question:    Would you be voting for the younger new candidate Obama or the older statemen McCain?     GEE HMM....What do you think that will result in...    It also depends on who you ask.  Likely voter polls are the best one; random polls bite and are worthless.  |`|1UXhspPMaa	it is because the poll reflect "likely" voters. these people that are polled dont have to vote for you the said in the poll and dont have to vote at all. in this election people 18 to 25 seem to be really into it, but there voter turn out is not the same as the other age groups, but they do fill out the online easy polls.|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	Polls are almost always biased, they can only account for the people who have internet, visit the sites that release polls and actually bother to participate in the polls.    Plus, a poll from AOL is almost certainly going to differ from a poll by CNN or by MSNBC because they appeal to different segments of the population.|`|RermzbWgaa	If it was one or even two polls it would not be a certainty, yet this involves far more than one or two polls.  Virtually every poll conducted is leading to the same conclusion, and many have Obama leading by more than 10 points.      Of course it is possible for people to change their minds, but things seem to be pushing them further and further away from McCain at the moment rather than closer to him.    Regardless....it really does not matter.  Both will be on the ballot on election day regardless of what the polls say.  I do not see how a poll influences anyone's vote so what difference does it make whether one believes the polls or not (unless it leads one to not vote at all...which is of course- completely irresponsible).|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	the Gov use polls so they can have something to fall back on once they rigg the votes...|`|APM9DlQSaa	Acorn changed pre-poll ballets.

Take a look    http://www.realclearpolitics.com/bush_vs...    compare that to the polls of Obama vs. McCain which has Obama ahead by a significant margin.    http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/...    While I can't find any convenient listing of poll numbers for Gore, the polls I looked at told the same story of Bush being ahead as often as Gore was.    So the conclusion I draw is that polling numbers were more accurate than people give them credit for, and thus Obama would win if the election was held today and will win if nothing drastic happens to change everything at the last minute.    And before you mention that I listed popular and not electoral votes which only the latter counts, I should point out that is only possible to win on electoral votes but lose in the popular vote if the popular vote between the candidates is within four percentage points.|`|S7Tveo2saa	Because they're right most of the time.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	Here's the thing: In 2004, the election was close regardless. The margin of error was larger than that separating the two candidates.    Now, in 2008, you've got one candidate consistently WAY ahead of the other with a margin of error that makes no difference.|`|EiH8BeYcaa	Hey , Zorak , remember the old superbowl commercial about lemmings , following each other over a cliff ?

fb38d603345f91f4d5080846b961e8a6aa	Centro di Permanenza Temporanea; a volte c' anche una A e significa: e Accoglienza.  Luoghi strutturati come prigioni, ma giuridicamente ed amministrativamente non tali, anche se le condizioni di vita dei trattenuti non sono molto diverse da quelle dei carcerati.  Sono stati istituiti dalla legge conosciuta come Turco-Napolitano e resi ancor pi ristrettivi da quella nota come Bossi-Fini.  In questi luoghi di restrizione delle libert personali vengono condotti tutti gli extracomunitari (quindi compresi perfino gli statunitensi ed un paio di volte, a quanto ne so io,  accaduto che ci finissero dentro cittadini povenienti da paesi ricchi, non comunitari) che vengano sorpresi sul terriorio nazionale privi di documenti idonei alla loro permanenza, il famoso permesso di soggiorno. Queste persone possono essere di due tipi: clandestini, coloro che sono entrati in ambito comunitario eludendo i controlli di frontiera; irregolari: coloro che hanno avuto regolare accesso, ma al momento del fermo non avevano pi il diritto a rimanere;  il caso di mancata ottemperanza degli obblighi burocratici da espletare entro 8 giorni dall'ingresso; periodo limitato di tempo previsto dal permesso (generalmente urismo o studio) e ormai esaurito: Oppure permesso di soggiorno per lavoro scaduto e non rinnovato, o decaduto per intercorse condanne penali.  Il motivo del trattenimento  quello del riconoscimento anagrafico dei singoli, la richiesta presso Ambasciate o Consolati dei presunti Paesi d'origine del nullaosta per il loro rimpatrio (in caso di mancanza di passaporto valido), documento indispensabile per trasferire chiunque da un Paese ad un altro.  Come  facilmente comprensibile il numero degli espusi non  mai alto.

Since the nose was heavy and stuck out debris, wind, and weather are more likely to break them due to gravity. It is the same with other objects that stuck out from statues all around the world. |`|fmDJJobTaa	If they were so advance, then how come they had such a hard time from preventing a few crackers from breaking off the Spinx's nose?  |`|1f9ae62867e615825fab65d29d47f217aa	that is all so insanely inaccurate i don't know where to begin.

Yeah the caucasoid destroyed everything I know.|`|EDRfHWOOaa	This is not true at all.  The Egyptian empire has never been larger than it is today.  In ancient egypt the southernmost city was Aswan, which is within Egypt's current footprint.  The Nubians were just south of Egypt, where Sudan is now.  As for Whites hating them for being so advanced... if they were so advanced, why were they able to be conquered by the more advanced Greeks under Alexander the Great, then the more advanced Romans, than the more advanced Arabs in 639, then the more advanced Ottomans in 1517, then the vastly more advanced French under Napoleon.  Then, when they attacked the much smaller nation of Israel, they were easily defeated.  So much for being advanced.  As for what happened to the nose, drawings of the Sphinx by Frederick Lewis Norden that date to at least 50 years before the French conquest of Egypt show the nose was missing.

Not only did they smash the faces but they chiseled away hieroglyphs.  I also believe they burnt down the library of Alexandria (after they took home the writings) to try to cover up the truth.    There are many stories but, it is known that the race of the Egyptians has been covered ever since the Greeks invaded, 300 year before the fall of Egypt.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	So much racism, so many negative stereotypes, so much hatred, so much misinformation...  The caucasions - you lump all whites together as though this was a concerted effort against blacks. That's a negative stereotype.  The French foreign legion (not all caucasions) used the Sphinx as target practice for their canons. It is theorized that this was because it was a broad, black-type nose. There are problems with this theory.   First - There is no record of what the Sphinx looked like before it was used for target practice so there's no evidence that it had a broad nose.   Second - The French have broader noses and thicker lips than other Europeans. Have you seen the facial features of the Statue of Liberty? A broad nose would make the Sphinx look more French and would not be intentionally shot off because of it's shape.   Third - Only a single Egyptian dynasty was black - the Nubians. That's only theorized. It's possible that no black dynasty ever ruled Egypt. In any case African blacks didn't build the massive monuments. Given that the Sphinx was built by an Egyptian Dynasty with Arabic features why would they have designed it to look black? It is most likely that the Sphinx had purely Egyptian features.  The French did not respect the Egyptian antiquities. It is most likely that they shot off the nose because it was the most prominent feature on which to target.  As for the rest of your inaccurate racist rant.... go get some professional help.

AA12070828	During the first Gulf War the US got a coalition together to push Iraq out of Kuwait. Period. To try and occupy Iraq at that time would have broken the coalition. There was no govt. or person in Iraq with enough power to lead the country leaving it open for Iran to step in and take over, therefor we left Saddam in power. Much like why we left the emperor of Japan in power after the second world war.   This time, we were after terrorists and terrorist States. We had no coalition to speak of and our goal was to remove Saddam from power.  So there were two different goals for each war.|`|AA11370204	September 11, 2001 changed the whole    ball game and we are going to KILL the AlQaida Terror Network just like we did in WWII  with the Japanese and Nazi Germany!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was decided that we could not let problems fester; that it would be even worse than the messiness we see now.  The "stability" of the region - the status quo - was no longer tolerable.  It was downright dangerous!    It's interesting how many Democrats criticize the decision to go into Iraq, after they voted for it and criticized Bush 43 for not "connecting the dots" on 9/11.  Iraq was a pretty big dot, and not going in would have been irresponsible.    This was after Democrats criticized Bush 41 all through the 90's for "not finishing the job," which was after they threatened to impeach Bush 41 if he "went to Baghdad" rather than just removing Saddam from Kuwait.    For the past year or two, Democrats have said Bush 43 did not have enough troops in Iraq.  Now he's putting more in - doing what they suggested - and instead of applauding it they are saying "it's too late" and wasting time with non-binding resolutions which do nothing but give our enemies hope that we are getting ready to give up.    The far more interesting question is: what has the Democrat policy on Iraq been for the past 15 years, other than to find out what the Republican is doing and then oppose it?.|`|29fb3b3381ad9f7ffc0c83e646c78273aa	because he wanted to show he was a better man than his father. that and saddam threatened his father.|`|W1BofvELaa	Because he wanted the oil fields for Cheney and Rumsfeld.|`|AA10664349	Bush 41 wasn't president when the nation was attacked on its own soil (Sept 11th.).

Saludos.|`|45276c60faa5c02fdc0065ce75d82709aa	Son unicamente razones politicas las causas de que gente que ni conoce la reforma se deja manejar por quien nada mas se la pasa poniendole zancadillas al gobierno.  Las reformas son buenas en general, podrian ser perfectibles, pero no son las formas las que se usan para protestar ni los motivos,....|`|Nh7eJFQ3aa	Mira la verdad es que slo he ledo algunos comentarios de periodistas muy bien enterados y que por supuesto han ledo esa ley, pero, por lo poco s y creo que la generalidad del pas, el ISSSTE al igual que el IMSS, fueron convertidos en un una mina de oro de los polticos del PRI y eso motivo que esas instituciones estn en la bancarrota y los nicos que se benefician son los trabajadores que laboran para el IMSS o en este caso para el ISSSTE, pero el fin para el fueron creados, prestar servicios de asistencia a la salud, han dejado por muchos a?os de incumplir con su encomienda, nada ms date una vuelta por hospitales de esas instituciones y sus instalaciones y el servicio esta deprimente, tienen enfermos hasta en los pasillos, sin clima artificial y sobre todo sin medicinas. Por lo que respecta a que los trabajadores ahora se van a jubilar con ms a?os de servicio, eso es bueno hasta para el cuerpo, entre ms a?os est activo el organismo, ms saludable estar el individuo; lo que pasa es que los trabajadores consentidos del sistema: IMSS, PETROLEROS, CFE, GOBIERNO FEDERAL, son los que ganan ms y quieren trabajar menos, por eso est el pas como est, porque la mayora de nosotros son unos holgazanes, o como dira mi abuelo: Son unos "bolsudos".|`|NfiDk0JKaa	Por Dios por que lloran tanto los del ISSTE?

En la mayoria de los paises la edad de retiro es a los 65 a?os o mas. Mientras mas longeva es la gente mas a?os vamos a estar todos aportando para su pension. Por eso el ISSTE tiene los problemas que tiene actualmente.|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	El escandalo yo creo que es nada ms por llevarle la contra al presente gobierno federal.....

Los politicos, casi todos, son una bola de personas que nada mas buscan su propio beneficio.|`|CLObAB1Yaa	Porque Lopez Obrador esta apoyando a los manifestantes para aparentar que el pais es un relajo y sacar provecho poltico en sus discursos, lo mismo ocurrira cada vez que pueda manipular a un conjunto de tontos.

No es para estar jubilosos, pero la otra opcin es comenzar a matar a todos los pensionados mayores de 60 a?os, asi que mejor tomamos esta.
aceb19175d8b5f3e44856d154561055aaa	I think it was the Soviets who loathed him most. He never subscribed to their brand of communism. Tito also successfully maintained Yugoslavia's independence from the Soviet bloc, which encompassed eastern Europe for over forty years.|`|wT5KBfVcaa	Where do i start? he created a bunch of artificial republic loosely connected on the basis of religion. As soon as he died, things started falling apart until finally the war erupted in the early 1990's.     Was he bad? I don't know. Was he great? Definitely not. he and his comrade took everything from people after WW2. Anyone who was rich was proclaimed an enemy and poor, diseased people from the middle of nowhere were brought to cities where they took over entirely. It was a shame.

As well, you will also need a waiver, certifying that you have declared your conviction and that the Army will accept you anyway.  It cannot be for certain things like domestic violence as any conviction of domestic violence, even a misdemeanor charge, means that you can never again own or carry a weapon even in your line of duty.  This comes about as a result of the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996.  When it was enacted, it put many thousands of military, law enforcement, and armed security out of a job because it did not matter that they had been convicted prior to the law being passed.|`|55GNtviDaa	depends on what the charge was, if all of your restitution and probation is done and your fines are all paid. It may be possible to get a waiver, that is depending on what the charge was.

I think they should drop the beret for garrison.|`|PWvS7vqPaa	The BDU's have been completely phased out from all Army units as of 30 April 2008 to include training and ROTC.  The only ones who still get them are JROTC cadets in some high schools.    As far as the switch goes, the ACU's are easier to see in wooded environments than the BDU's, but the ACU's are not meant to perfectly conceal soldiers in just woods.  Rather they are meant as an all purpose uniform for camouflage in desert, wooded, and urban environments.|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	We no longer use the BDU. Supposedly the new digital camo is harder for the eye to make out and therefor better for us.     And the velcro is so everything is quick. If you need to be stealthy then you probably don't need to get anything from your pockets. I personally like the new Army Combat Uniform. Doesn't restrict movement, allows easy access/security for my medical supplies (sharpie, treatment tags, tape), and allows good airflow.     I like em...now the new dress uniform I will never own. Screw the blues
4ec81de5fbdce99a64d06a115ca73894aa	Too bad they have your SS .  It should be guarded like a credit card to avoid misuse.  A lot of info is open to whoever has your personal ID.  Call an attorney or legal aid and ask for their recommendations.  Ask if you should or could get a new SS .    Also, talk to whoever is doing that and ask them to stop invading your privacy.  If they refuse, call the police and ask them if there is anything you can do about it.  Don't give up til you've exhausted all avenues of safety for your personal information.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	Turn them in.

Da un po' di anni per si sta verificando una cosa preoccupante per loro: l'arrivo di 2 miliardi di nuovi consumatori (la cina e l'india). E costoro consumano, consumano eccome.  Si arriver ad un punto che bisogner sedersi attorno ad un tavolo, e discutere delle risorse e trovare compromessi. Questo significa rinunciare proprio a quello stile di vita a cui per nulla la mondo gli americani vogliono rinunciare.    Quello che sta avvendo oggi non  nient'altro che l'espandersi americano al fine di arrivare a dominare le risorse planetarie, a partire dal petrolio, per giungere al punto in cui nessuno in un futuro prossimo potr pi alzare la testa contro di loro.

JgzpQ7xEaa	Seems to me if your true goal is to be an Army nurse and not to pay for school; you should join Army ROTC. Especially if that school has a nursing program. If you are accepted, your school is fully paid for, you get a book allowance each semester and stipend money each month. When completed, you are commissioned as a 2nd LT and serve in either Active Army, Army National Guard or Army Reserves. It depends on what kind of scholarship you accept. I would recommend however, that you at least attend Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training. There are many enlisted medical mos' you could choose from. The enlisted active duty training is priceless. In either case, if you are active duty whether enlisted or officer, there is a program for married Army couples to be stationed together, depending on rank the BAH you receive will vary. You can email me if you have questions. |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	don't do it, PLEASE. did you know that 1/3 of America's homeless are veterans?|`|zW0dcgFPaa	Hi there. I myself am in the Navy now, and the military will pay for a certain amount of college while you're still enlisted. It's called Tuition Assistance, or TA for short. If you do decide to join the military, I would definitely recommend getting the Montgomery G.I. Bill to pay for college afterward. But you won't be able to take college during your entire time in the military. They won't allow you to take college during any training you have, nor, if I remember correctly, when you are deployed. If you are eligible, then they can pay B.A.H. (basic allowance for housing) so that you can live off base. If you marry someone in the army while you are also in the army, I think that you both get extra pay for living away from each other. If you marry someone in the army and you're not in the army yourself, then they will pay extra for each dependent he has, including you, and for living away from you if that happens to be the case. I have to agree with the Air Force recommendation, though, if you want to join the military.|`|Byn1oLrBaa	they will not pay for a home...i am pretty shure they will pay for your college if its in the us.....if you want to be a nerse in the army u should be prepared for life changing thins it is vary blooding and u have to be hard core...seeing all those dead people or injerd people could dammege you for life|`|FpBuCy31aa	Hi, me and my boyfriend met in the Army. We were both in the Dental field. What we did was, we joined the Reserves, went to Basic Training and AIT (Army School). When we both got home, we went to college, the GI Bill paid for everything!!!! My boyfriend actually went to ROTC in college, and graduated in 2006 and became an officer. I am no longer in the Army, but he still is. If we get married, he will get extra pay for me, and an allowance for living (housing and food). If you marry someone in the service, you will get great benefits- free school, free medical, and alot of other perks. The Army isn't for everyone, if I were you, I would seriously consider the Air Force!!! Good Luck, feel free to contact me if you have additional ?s...

I don't think it would be difficult to plant that seed of doubt in the minds of the average person in a jury when it came to the credibility of what a "psychic" had to say.|`|w9EQcmQ4aa	I think if those people are helping the police to solve serious crimes and the information they give is very useful then I feel it is a great help. I cannot imagine the police would use someone who they have not checked out thoroughly first. I have seen some incredible detective work done by some of these psychic people, who mostly keep right out of the public arena and never advertise their services. There is just so much in this universe we don't know about, and to completely brush these people off as frauds is a bit illogical.. To me it's a bit like saying we are the only life force in the universe and even top scientists now agree that in such a vast space the chances of there being other life forms is extremely likely. So who is to say that all psychics are frauds..certainly not me.|`|sn0x5xVRaa	I think anyone who claims to have a vision about a murder and is proved correct, should become the prime suspect.

e889711a4759110b6220f2b9488aa8f1aa	Da buon apolitico ed apartitico totale che sono (ed attualmente in progressiva fase di allergenizzazione a tutti i movimenti politici italiani) vorrei rispondere alle sue domande, poich le ha poste e vuole commenti.    La domanda principale (eravamo...). No, eravate in 2.401.322 (forse, cos  un pochino pi contento).  Nelle puntualizzazioni parla di brividi ecc. ecc. Ma lei sa che tutti gli italiani nella loro prevalenza fanno parte di uno dei popoli pi civili del mondo (indipendentemente dall'inclinazione politica)?     Alla fine della frase viene un dubbio - come se fossimo stati ... - a quanto ne so c'era un piccolo e sparuto gruppo che festeggiava in Sicilia (anche se questa lo sappiamo tutti  solo una strategia politica che in futuro vedr i suoi frutti per dolci od amari che saranno).    Sono contento per lei ed il 'suo' popolo di centro destra, che la giornata passata sia stata piacevole, nonostante la fatica nel raggiungere Roma e sono ulteriormente d'accordo con lei quando afferma 'evviva la libert e abbasso coloro che la limitano', ma si fermi l: 'i signori attualmente al governo stanno perseguendo la propria strategia che - agli occhi dell'opposizione  sbagliata'... Il problema  che la strategia del governo  sbagliata anche agli occhi della gente (come quella accorsa a Roma e anche quella rimasta a casa.. Io credo a quelle statistiche che dicono di riporre pochissima fiducia in quello che sta avvenendo attualmente -- quindi di fatto sono d'accordo con lei anche sul fatto che il governo sta lavorando abbastanza male).    Come gi premesso, il commento gliel'ho dato e se vuole mi avvicino anche al suo movimento (quando fa le cose giuste), ma non mi sposto da dove sono con le mie convinzioni, fintanto che la politica ed il suo mondo saranno cos distanti dalle esigenze e dai problemi dei cittadini (tutti).    Per l'ultima domanda... Guardi, negli anni '70 un famoso partito di sinistra diceva la stessa cosa ed oggi - se guarda bene -  saldamente in cabina di pilotaggio di questa coalizione - mi permettano il termine i simpatizzanti di sinistra - costantemente in fase di verifica. Per cui, se la storia si ripete (e si ripete, si fidi) molto probabilmente l'attuale destra italiana ha ottime possibilit di essere una promessa (giovane) del futuro (sperando che le cariatidi della politica riescano a scollare i propri deretani dalle poltrone di palazzo).

L'appunto  meglio farlo prima di essere subissato di insulti...  2: Non pensate che invece di questa finanziaria che ha colpito tutti (e ripeto TUTTI!) forse sarebbe stata meglio una finanziaria dedicata ai tagli degli sprechi in italia?   Qualche esempio:   alta velocit che in italia costa 5 milioni di euro a m mentre negli altri paesi costa 2...  Pensioni di invalidit elargite a persone che non le meritano...  Politici che dopo due anni e mezzo ricevono liquidazione e pensione parlamentare alla faccia nostra che lavoriamo come muli...  Lavori ed opere iniziate in italia e mai finite...  Soldi che vengono assorbiti in tasse e non utilizzati (che in teoria dovrebbero essere nelle casse dello stato ma chiss perch ho l'impressione che siano state ciucciate dai soliti noti...  OPERATORI PUBBLICI CHE SI IMBOSCANO E CHE NOI PAGHIAMO FIOR DI QUATTRINI E CHE INVECE DI LAVORARE SI SVACCANO IN POSTI SICURI ALLA FACCIA NOSTRA...  ( ma  possibile che in calabria  in sicilia ci sono 20000 guardie forestali mentre in tutta la norvegia solo 5000???)  ecc. ecc. ecc.    IL MIO PENSIERO E' CHE CHIUNQUE SAREBBE POTUTO ANDARE AL GOVERNO E MASSACRARE LA POPOLAZIONE PIU' TASSATA D'EUROPA.

Per le organizzazioni paramilitari irlandesi che dopo il 1922 si proclamarono legittime eredi dell'Esercito repubblicano e presero la denominazione di "Irish Republican Army" vedi Irish Republican Army (1922-1969), Official Irish Republican Army (1969- ), Provisional Irish Republican Army (1969- ), Continuity Irish Republican Army (1986- ) e Real Irish Republican Army (1997- ).     --------------------------------------...    L'Irish Republican Army (IRA) (in gaelico: glaigh na hireann), a volte indicata come Old IRA (Vecchia IRA), era un'organizzazione militare nata dai Volontari Irlandesi, che nel 1919 il Dil ireann riconobbe come esercito della Repubblica Irlandese, proclamata durante la Rivolta di Pasqua del 1916 e riaffermata dal Dil nel gennaio 1919. Come tale, l'IRA combatt nella Guerra d'indipendenza contro le forze britanniche.    Dopo la firma del Trattato Anglo-Irlandese nel 1921, i membri dell'IRA che lo approvavano formarono il nucleo dell'Esercito Nazionale fondato nel 1922 dal leader dell'IRA Michael Collins. Anche se la parte dell'IRA contraria al Trattato continu ad esistere dopo la sconfitta nella Guerra civile irlandese, a partire dagli anni '30 perse gran parte del favore che i Repubblicani dell'isola le avevano inizialmente accordato. Nessuna delle organizzazioni che, nei decenni successivi, hanno assunto il nome di Irish Republican Army con il proposito di proclamarsi legittime eredi dell'Esercito repubblicano ha visto le sue rivendicazioni accolte dal Dil ireann. Nei fatti, solo una parte minoritaria della popolazione irlandese ritiene che queste organizzazioni continuino la tradizione politica dell'Irish Republican Army al tempo della Guerra d'indipendenza. Per meglio distinguerlo dall'esercito della Repubblica d'Irlanda e dalle organizzazioni che in seguito hanno usato (e usano) lo stesso nome, l'esercito repubblicano viene anche definito Old IRA.    Origini  Il Repubblicanismo irlandese della forza fisica, come ideologia, ha una lunga storia, dagli Irlandesi Uniti delle ribellioni del 1798 e del 1803, alla Rivolta della Giovane Irlanda del 1848 e alla rivolta della Fratellanza Repubblicana Irlandese nel 1867. Inoltre, i metodi dell'IRA vennero in qualche modo ispirati dalle tradizioni delle societ segrete agrarie irlandesi, come i Defenders, i Ribbonmen e i sostenitori della Irish Land League.    L'acronimo IRA venne usato per la prima volta in America dall'organizzazione chiamata Fratellanza Repubblicana Irlandese (nota anche come Fratellanza Feniana). Questa "Irish Republican Army" degli anni 1860 comprendeva le forze paramilitari dei Feniani statunitensi, organizzate in alcuni reggimenti. Soldati Feniani che indossavano le insegne dell'IRA combatterono nella Battaglia di Ridgeway (2 giugno 1866). Comunque il termine Irish Republican Army, inteso nel suo senso moderno, venne usato per la prima volta nel secondo decennio del XX secolo, per indicare le forze ribelli dei Volontari Irlandesi e della Irish Citizens Army, durante la Rivolta di Pasqua. Venne in seguito e pi comunemente usato per quei volontari che combatterono una capagna di guerriglia nel 1919-1921, in supporto alla Repubblica d'Irlanda, dichiarata nel 1919.      [modifica] Antefatti - la Home Rule e i Volontari  La violenza politica che scoppi in Irlanda tra il 1916 e il 1923, aveva le sue origni nelle richieste del nazionalismo irlandese per l'indipendenza dalla Gran Bretagna, e nella resistenza unionista a queste richieste. Entro il 1914, questa questione giunse ad una impasse, con il governo britannico pronto a concedere la Home Rule o l'autogoverno all'Irlanda. Ci port alla formazione di milizie armate unioniste e nazionaliste, rispettivamente la Ulster Volunteer Force e i Volontari Irlandesi.    Il Government of Ireland Act 1914, pi generalmente noto come Third Home Rule Act, fu un atto approvato dal parlamento britannico nel maggio 1914, che cercava di dare all'Irlanda un autogoverno regionale all'interno del Regno Unito di Gran Bretagna e Irlanda. Anche se ricevette l'assenso reale nel settembre 1914, la sua implementazione venne rinviata fino a dopo la I guerra mondiale, tra paure che l'opposizione alla home rule da parte degli Unionisti Irlandesi e il contrabbando illegale di armi da parte dell'Ulster Volunteer Force e dei Volontari Irlandesi, avrebbero portato alla guerra civile.    La resistenza venne temporaneamente evitata dallo scoppio della I guerra mondiale nell'agosto del 1914. I Volontari Irlandesi si divisero, i National Volunteers, con oltre 100.000 membri, guidati dal leader del Partito Parlamentare Irlandese, John Redmond, erano pronti ad accettare le promesse britanniche di concedere la home rule, e circa 20.000 di essi servirono in guerra per l'esercito britannico. Comunque, circa 12.000 Volontari, guidati da Eoin MacNeill e che dominavano la segreta Fratellanza Repubblicana Irlandese, si rifiutarono di unirsi allo sforzo bellico britannico e mantennero il nome di Volontari Irlandesi. Dove MacNeill intendeva usare la forza solo per resistere all'imposizione della coscrizione in Irlanda, gli uomini della FRI intendevano lanciare una ribellione armata per conseguire l'indipendenza irlandese.    Una organizzazione pi piccola, la Irish Citizen Army - in origine un'associazione di difesa dei lavoratori guidata dal socialista James Connolly - progett indipendentemente la propria rivolta. Per evitare confusioni, la FRI coopt Connolly nel suo consiglio supremo nel 1915. McNeill, comunque non ebbe mai notizia della prevista insurrezione.

4d025edb9dd19f92984fc63af3be3b21aa	Both the president and the Congress (what you might consider the legislature or "government") work together, though each has a specific role as dictated by the Constitution. Generally, laws are passed by Congress and the President can make the "decision" whether or not to veto those laws, though the senate can always override his veto (his dissapproval). The Supreme Court can in turn declare any of those laws void if they do not conform to the Constitution. The President, though, is the Commander in Chief (the head of the arm forces) and can make the decision to go to war or step up a war (as we are doing in Iraq now). He can also issue executive orders which are like laws or decrees that do not require Congressional approval, though Congress can still question and amend these orders. So in short, they both play a role, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the decisions to be made.|`|sGWljYFUaa	The President is part of the government. We have 3 branches of government in the US, the legislative (Congress) that makes the laws, the executive who executes or makes the laws happen (President), and the judicial (Supreme Court) provides guidance and council to the other two by interpreting the Constitution. The President has some authority to make decisions on his own but eventually he will have to fund the decision or will need to explain and that is where Congress and the Court comes in. The President must sign a  bill agreed to by both houses of Congress before that bill becomes law. If the law is unconstitutional the Supreme Court can rule it is unconstitutional and it is not the law any more.|`|68625259986146510cbf9f8cfa6f98ebaa	Depends on which decisions.  See Articles I and II.|`|eb0e8954e16aa3bf1fb63854b5837083aa	All branches of the government and the end result has to have the President's approval.Mostly done by senate and congress.

AA11710504	I'm not actually sure.    If you're going to be stationed there, there should be someone to pick you up (contact your new unit about a sponsor) or a military shuttle to take you to post.  If neither of these are available, see if the airport has a USO and ask them.  They're likely to give you the best place to go for cheap transport to base.

AA10899250	I live in Amissville, VA.    1) Foreign Policy - (I would actually combine this with war & peace as well. Both issues have a direct correlation with eachother.) The world we live in is not a friendly place. I firmly believe, after doing much reading on the subject, that the people who hate us want nothing more than to cause us harm and drag the Middle East  into further isolation. This can not be tolerated for several reasons. Among these being the welfare of this nation as well as the welfare and rights of the citizens of each Middle Eastern nation. The policies we make now in regards to the rest of the world will effect us all for years to come. We must not allow any group of aggresors weaken humanity on this planet.    2) Homeland Security - Without this, everything else on your list is futile. We have to be sure that all access into and out of this country is secure. That includes the borders and ports of entry, as well as communication lines. We have to stay one step ahead of those who wish to do us harm. For too many decades we acted as if terrorism was an unpleasant part of life. That attitude only embolden our enemies to strike harder. We can not let that happen again, or we will definetly have more pressing issues than social security or welfare.    3) Education - One way the government can prepare its citizens to tackle the tough issues facing the world today is by affording them universal education. This country lives under the illusion that we are number one in everything, but nothing could be farther from the truth. We are steadily declining in education in comparison with other industrialized nations. This can not be allowed to continue. By educating its citizens, the U.S. government can assure a brighter future for all. It can give those on the bottom rung of the ladder of life a helping hand up. It is a proven fact that people with a college degree make an average of $23,000 more a year, and that is only with a bachelors degree. To someone, like myself, who is only making $18,000 a year on a high shool diploma, that can mean a world of difference.|`|3db332425694490a72f67bd5a83990d6aa	As a Northern Virginian, I have one single issue:  Transportation.

Let's take it from the top. Firstly, it's evident that you believe in God. Now, what does God say? Be of good report. Sin is sin. Okay, so you may not feel like answering the phone right  at the moment. But that's not something to argue about-and name calling is definitely out! If you're both arguing over such a petty thing, you're both hypocrites-you took a vow before God to love, cherish, you know, sickness and health, good and bad-remember? Marriage is practiced, so you two must practice it. First, stop arguing over petty things, and try talking to each other. Second, Matt. 7:1 says "Judge, lest you be judged". So neither of you can judge the other, because God is the ultimate judge. And none of us can really stand up to His judgement. So, try talking together, and remember the love that made you get married in the first place.

If you really want to know the answer to your question I suggest you buy his latest book. Isreal "hates" him for telling the truth of how they make things into impossible for the Palistinians.|`|AA10333764	1. Are you aware that the Disputed Territories never belonged to the "Palestinians" and only came into Israeli possession as a result of the 1967 six day war in which Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon all massed forces at Israel's border in order to "push the Jews into the sea". The Arabs lost and Israel took control of the land. Do you agree that if the Koranimals don't want to lose territory to Israel, then they shouldn't start wars? Do you agree that there is justice that Israel, who as far back as 1948 has always sought peace with her far larger neighbors, should live in prosperity - making the desert bloom - while the residents of 19 adjacent Arab countries who are blessed with far more land as well as oil wealth live in their own feces?    2. Did you know that the "Palestinians" could have had their own country as far back as 1948 had they accepted the UN sponsored partition plan which gave Israel AND the Palestinians a countries of their own on land which Jews had lived on for thousands of years before Mohammed ever had a wet dream about virgins? The Arabs rejected the UN offer and went to war with the infant Israeli nation. The Arabs lost and have been whining about it ever since. Do you agree this is like a murderer who kills his parents and asks for special treatment since he is now an orphan?    3. Can you tell us ANY Arab country which offers Jews the right to be citizens, vote, own property, businesses, be a part of the government or have ANY of the rights which Israeli Arabs enjoy? Any Arab country which gives those rights to Christians? How about to other Arabs? Wouldn't you just LOVE to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, or Syria?    4. Since as many Jews (approximately 850,000) were kicked out of Arab countries as were Arabs who left present day Israel (despite being literally begged to stay), why should Arabs be permitted to return to Israel if Jews aren't allowed to set foot in Arab countries? Can you explain why Arabs can worship freely in Israel but Jews would certainly be hung from street lamps after having their intestines devoured by an Arab mob if they so much as entered an Arab country?    5. Israel resettled and absorbed all of the Jews from Arab countries who wished to become Israelis. Why haven't any Arab countries offered to resettle Arabs who were displaced from Israel, leaving them to rot for 60 years in squalid refugee camps? And why are those refugee camps still there? Could it be that the billions of dollars that the UNWRA has sent there goes to terrorist groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, El Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, or Hezbollah? How did Yassir Arafat achieve his $300 million in wealth? Why aren't these funds distributed for humanitarian use?    6. Did you know that the Arabs in the disputed territories (conquered by Israel in the 1967 war which was started by Arabs) and who are not Israelis already have two countries right now? And that they are called Egypt and Jordan?    7. If your complaint is about the security fence which Israel is finally building in the Disputed Territories, are you aware that it is built solely to keep the "brave" Arab terrorists out so that they can no longer self detonate on busses, in dining halls or pizzerias and kill Jewish grandmothers and schoolchildren? Why are the Arabs so brave when they target unarmed civilians but even when they outnumber their opponents they get their sandy asses kicked all the way to Mecca when they are faced with Jewish soldiers? Why do Arab soldiers make the French look like super heroes?    8. Please explain why you are so concerned about Arabs, who possess 99% of the land in this region and are in control of the world's greatest natural resource, which literally flows out of the ground? Can't their brother muslims offer some of the surplus land and nature's riches to the "Palestinians"? Or is it true that Arabs are willing to die right down to the last "Palestinian"?    9. Why do you not exhibit the same level of concern for say, people in Saudi Arabia who are beheaded, subject to amputation, stoning, honor killing etc.? What about women who are denied any semblance of basic civil rights, including the right not to be treated as property for the entertainment and abuse of her father, brothers, or husbands? What about the Muslims in Sudan and Egypt who are still enslaved, or the women there whose genitalia are barbarically cut off? How about the oppression of Shiites by Sunnis, the gassing of the Kurds by Iraq, or the massacre of "Palestinians" by Jordan (Black September)? Why doesn't this concern you?    10. Did you ever stop to wonder how much better off everyone in the region would be if Arabs stopped trying to kill Jews and destroy Israel? What would happen if the Israelis gave up their weapons and disarmed? Would they live to see the next day? But what would happen if the Arabs completely disarmed? You know the answer: They would all be AT PEACE! And if there is no war to rile them up, the Arabs would be forced to look at their own repressive, pre-medieval societies. Why would they want to do that when there are Jews to kill?    11. Have you heard "People who define themselves primarily by what they hate, rather than who they love, are doomed to failure and misery"? Can you see the parallels to the Arabs, who are blessed with land and oil, but still gladly train their children to kill themselves in order to kill Jews? Have you heard Golda Meir's words to the effect of "There will be peace when the Arabs love their children more than they hate ours"? Why do the Arabs hate so much?

AA10464818	I have researched grants thoroughly and not once have I seen people donating kidney or other organs eligible for grants to start a business.    In fact, it is hard to find grants to start a business -- whether you donated an organ or not. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business.     Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...    "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance.

utJTwV2Haa	In America marijuana is illegal.    There are two kinds of pot: regular and hydroponic. Schwag is regular. It has seeds and stems, compacted, and smells skunky. Dro is hydro or chronic. It is seedless with crystals on the buds, and is usually lose, smells piny or very pungent.     It sells in grams-ounces-pounds. 1 pound=16 ounces= 448 grams  Common Sacks:  nickel, dime, eigth, quarter, half...    In other countries and on the black market this is price range:    Regular-Schwag  Nickels/Dimes are 5 dollar and 10 dollar bags. They vary from seller to seller.   Eighth= 3.5 grams/10 bucks  Quarter= 7 grams/20-25 bucks  Half= 14 grams/ 30-40 bucks  Ounce= 28 grams/ 50-70 bucks    Dro  gram= 20 bucks  eighth= 50-70 bucks  quarter= 90-120 bucks  half= 180-240 bucks  ounce= 320-400 bucks    everything varys on quality. but a good rule of thumb is this: regular- never pay more than 25/quarter... dro- never pay more than 20/gram or 60/8th    good luck.  |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	too much for something that shold be free  |`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	Anywhere between $300 (fine for possession) and 15 years in Federal Prison (for running a grow operation).|`|1NotrSTnaa	i spend nothing on it, because i pride myself in being in good shape|`|VYAAizTsaa	Nickle bag- Five dollars  Dime bag- Ten dollars  Dub- Twenty dollars  You get the idea.    Amounts on what you buy vary, play the market or make a good buddy who sells to get the most hooch for you dollar.  And the better the quality, the more it will cost.  A dub will still be twenty dollars, but you'll get alot less if you buy Mexican Red-Hair as opposed to commercial grade.|`|LAMlw5zKaa	shwag aka dirt should be free no matter how much your gettin because that **** is well.............. dirt like i said!  mid-grade will run $5 a nic and any where from $65-$120 an ounce!  i usually pay $65 through good deals but wen your gettin more some people either go up or down in price usually down unless everything is already baged up in nics!    and as far as dro goes..... it is a lime green loose marijuana with no seeds and tha cheapest i ever get it 4 is $10 a nic wich is an unbeatable price but can sometimes be as expensive as $20-$25 bucks a nic!    it all depends on who you go through, where u live and how high demand for it is!    I live in Milwaukee WI and dont think just cause im from milwaukee that i dont kno what im talkin bout because ive been many places and have had all different types of weed and its been just as good as anything ive ever had in cali!    much love!

Nejnh1Bqaa	Have seen people cross from one service to another before.  Went to Navy Boot Camp with a few people that were Army vets.  Obviously the needs of the service he wants to cross over to come into play on whether they will accept him.  The Navy has many ratings that don't exist in the Coast Guard, but if he is in a rating that corresponds directly to a Coast Guard rating then it might be easier.      The question of can it be done is fairly easy to answer, it is Yes.  People do it all the time.  Whether he can do it is a question better posed to the Coast Guard or the Air Force, since these things are done on an individual basis.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	The Coast Guard is only accepting a limited number of prior service personnel.  Your husband should contact a Coast Guard recruiter now and explore his options.|`|kHs0rTEXaa	Yes, if he's E-4 or above he probably qualifies for the Prior Service Training Program, and can avoid taking the full 8 week boot camp for new accessions and may be able retain his rate and pay grade, if it is comparable to a USCG rate.  Talk to a recruiter about the details of the process.
jeHTjvbaaa	I just had mine yesterday =P Well, dress nice, not need for a flashy dress or anything, just go business casual and you will be fine.  Don't be nervous either, these guys are here to help you, not hurt you.  It wasn't what I was expecting though, he spent the first 20 minutes explaining what the ROTC was, I already knew it all but he said it was required to cover.  After that I asked a few questions and then we went to measure my height and weight.  After that we went back to the office and he pulled out the resume I brought with me about my leadership experience.  the next 40 minutes was just going through the resume and expanding upon what I put down, as I explained further he wrote it all down on a piece of paper.  There were only a few questions about why I wanted to join.  For example, what do you like about our constitution, what do you think a good leader is, why do you want to join?  There really is no way to prepare though.  All in all it was not as bad as I had imagined and the interviewer made me feel extremely comfortable, even gave me coffee and cake lol.  Good Luck with it and beleieve me, they are just trying to find out who you are as a person and then they submit their review to the board.  Getting the interview means they are at least considering you.|`|S55mhoSgaa	i don't know anything about what to expect but this is common sense.    wear formal clothing and use manners. Don't use slang like "dude" or even "gonna" and make sure u dont make urself look like a fool. Make sure u know plenty about AF ROTC and all that.

AA11117716	As "Political Junk..." said, ROTC stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps.  Many larger universities offer these programs, sponsored by a branch of the armed forces.  Ideally, you would graduate from the university, having been in the program for four years, and would join the military branch as a Commissioned Officer.  My friends who went the ROTC route, however, have told me that you have until your second year in the program before you actually have to commit to joining the military.  In your case, medical issues for normal enlistment are the same for commissioning after graduation.  You would either have to find a way to eliminate these issues, or get out of the ROTC program after two years.    Benefits of the ROTC program:  Good military training.  Fun activities as part of training (rock climbing, flying, etc.)  Money for college as part of ROTC scholarships.    Disadvantages:  Rules for those who qualify, in addition to university rules.  Time commitment to service after graduation (usually 4 years).    Best of luck to you in wherever your adventures lead you!|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	ROTC stands for Reserve Officers Training Corps and you still have to go through a physical and all of that gobbledygook...at least they did when I was in high school.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	reserve officers training corp,,,,,provides a pool of educated soldiers for nations defence needs you have to be in high school,but you can join up,or enlist,and get financial assistance during or after service|`|PWvS7vqPaa	ROTC is the Reserve Officer Training Corps and is one of the 5 methods by which a person can obtain a commission in the army.  Anyone can join as that is its intention, to turn either prior enlisted or civilians into officers.  However, you still have to go through a medical screening under the DODMERB or Department of Defense Medical Examination and Review Board.  It is about like the one you would take at MEPS and just as restrictive, so if all four branches turned you down, then they will too.  ROTC is not a backdoor method for gaining entry into the military.    Just to add on, the 5 methods of obtaining a commission in the Army are:    * ROTC - used for obtaining a commission while earning a degree  * OCS - primarily used or prior service, but also available for new soldiers  * USMA at West Point - Army's premiere military academy  * Direct Commission - usually for prior service NCO's to get promoted to officer, but also for doctor's, nurses, lawyers, and chaplains wishing to join the military but with no prior service  * Battlefield Commission - allows for a commander to temporarily promote an enlisted soldier to that of an officer for pusposes of keeping the rank structure in tact and although it is still authorized or use, it is no longer done    EDIT: In regards to what bigrubbermoose said, he is mostly right, but just wanted to clarify a few things.  Your committment after ROTC is only 3 years if you go active duty, or 8 if you go Guard/Reserve.  If you get an active duty scholarship, your obligation will be four years long if active, and 8 still if you take a Guard/Reserve scholarship.    Also, you cannot contract during your first year in ROTC if you do not have a scholarship, but must contract by the third year.  What this means for you is that they will not bother to get you a DODMERB physical during the first two years if you wish to try it.  However, when it comes down to it, you will not be able to contract with them due to your medical issues.|`|AORcLwTNaa	a club
55GNtviDaa	Both branches require you to pick a job, explore both to see who has what you want. Just remember that the Army is land based and the Navy is mostly sea based, so go from there. Look at both, don't just talk to the recruiter talk to the station commander of both where the recruiter works. Because I was once a recruiter and its all a sales game, the recruiter is only there for a couple of years, the station commander is there for good, depending on who is the better sales man will help you determine which is better for you. But just remember which ever branch you choose, do it for you and make sure that you get what you ask for, not what they want you to have. If they try to give you something that you don't want DO NOT sign the contract, yes it's a contract not a enlistment agreement!|`|0szdPqI0aa	which job interests you in both.  you do not just join. you pick a job.  what jobs in the navy interest you. what about the army?  repost this question with the job both interest you.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Have to say Army because I was in it a long time ago but have allot of respect for the Navy, cleaner living.

ZL1KJqRaaa	Promotions up to e-4 are based on time in grade, and time in service. for example, it takes 6 months on average to make a pvt2, 4 months as a private and 12 months to make pfc, then 6 months tig and 24 months time in service to make corporal/specialist. the ranks past e-4 are based on performance, but usually promotion to sergeant is something like 4.2 years on average|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	it all depends on you and the knowledge you have and if your in good shape i heard that they will give you a test and stuff before promoting you but i think its harder and takes longer for a female to get promoted i know a girl thats been in the marines for almost 4 yrs and is only a L.C (lance corpral) and another guy friend thats a L.C and only been in for a yr so its all depends on you    well mariner thats y i said i THINK which means im not sure and also said it depends on the person and depends how much they know|`|cEFiOrX5aa	Brandon I have seen many Marine Lance Corporals who were guys and they had one service mark (hash marks for 4 years service) on their dress blue uniforms. The USMC promotes pretty slowly, has nothing to do with women/men.|`|55GNtviDaa	you can get promoted pretty quickly in the Army, depending on you. If you do what is asked and be where you are supposed to be, pass a physical fitness test E-1 thru E-4 can happen in about 2 years, to make corproal is a lateral transfer, doesn't happen too often but can. To make sergeant that is a whole different story.
r6zLN0Daaa	Most of my shifts were 12 hours. So if nothing bad goes wrong 12hrs off if sh-t hits the fan 0 hours. every day is different|`|vKxt1i0Faa	More hours than they have activities for. Most shifts are 12 on 12 off.|`|asX2hxFXaa	It depends on whether they're in the streets or in the trenches or in the mountains of Afghanistan ... in which case, not very darn much (and it's rest time, not "free" time) ... or if they're support personnel behind the lines in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, in which case, it's at worse case 12 hours on 12 hours off.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Please define "free time", terrorists never seem to quit|`|6cea0fb6ab51699b576b42c1834ae12eaa	depends based on availability, conditions, etc.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	It depends on their job over there, because everybody doesn't do the same thing over there.  It could vary from several hours a day to the time they get to sleep.  I knew some troops who worked regular hours like in the US and others who work 12 hours days or longer seven days a week.
AA10719402	NAFTA is a free trade union      EU is a monetary and economic union.|`|ktMefP0oaa	The same as China, to take as many jobs from Americans as possible,supply cheap labor in mexico and use our roads to bring in products American companies had made there and shipped back with no tarriffs, the EU just wants us to buy all the steel we used to make here from them, and run our aircraft industry out of business. They are both after the same thing your job and our dollar.
