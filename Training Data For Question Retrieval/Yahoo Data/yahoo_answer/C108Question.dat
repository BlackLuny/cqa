My father recommended me the book "They Dare To Speak Out" - by Paul Findly when i asked him this question...OMG was i appaled and shocked. AIPAC has such a significant pressure on our foreign policy and if u are planning on occupying a high ranking position in this country and you dont agree 100% with the Israeli lobby it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to achieve anything. Now, my uncle was killed in Gaza as a volunteer red cross medic. Im still struggling to understand how exactly he was killed because he was in his ambulance when the Israeli rockets came down.. and his vehicle was clearly labeled and was stationary AND its coordinates were given to israli military officials...How... how does the U.S. allow itself to be run by the israeli lobby?? How did this come to be? and Will or can it ever be changed?       I believe if America was not guide as much as it is by the foreign policy AIPAC provides for it my uncle would still be here along with THOUSANDS of our soldiers and civilians (9/11)... I am 15 and recognize what is happening, how come the majority of civivlians have NO CLUE??       R.I.P- everyone who had been killed in the middle east wars and to those who were killed by 9/11 and to my uncle, who might have still been sitting next to me today. God bless all the families...      UPDATE- i also read about the bombing and destruction of the USS Liberty , i cannot understand how these bombing by Israel can be justifies, please can someone clear up these points.      Define anti-semitism because i hear this word come up every time some issue with israel is brought up?
20090128134424AAW2U9Y	Politics & Government;Elections	Don't these people realize that ?	For those who think that Obama's massive government spending program ( disguised under the nice name of a " stimulus package " ) is good for America.........      Don't  these people realize that Obama's Plan ( which is the Most Expensive Government Spending Program in US History ) intends  to artificially " create " ( NOT save ) 3-4 million government & private jobs  many of which will only ?  :      1) Cost more to create & sustain the job  than the salary that the job  will generate      2) Duplicate work already being done by other American Workers      3) Create " makework " or " busywork " jobs for obsolete, archaic positions         For Example; don't these people realize that it will cost the goverment at least $ 100,000 annually to create, subsidize, oversee and continually fund a job with an annual salary of $ 50,000 ?      Don't these people realize that instead of having 5 guys working on a road crew assigned to repair a pothole where 2 guys are leaning on their shovels as 3 guys fill in the pothole........ Obama will now use government monies so 10 guys can be assigned to repair that same pothole where 7 guys are now leaning on their shovels as 3 guys fill in the pothole ?         Don't these people realize that creating " makework " or " busywork " jobs is ineffective and usually winds up hiring many people for obsolete, long-gone positions such as Office Clerks who used to carry inner office communications from desk to desk throughout the day before offices used emails, etc. ?      Don't these people realize that Obama's desire to exercise more government control over business & individuals is only taking America one step further toward losing our freedoms as Americans and one step closer toward Socialism ?

20090128142829AAWwR3H	Politics & Government;Government	Poll:  Are you pro bipartisan stimulus package or not?	Excerpts from the AP (Associated Press) that I found interesting:      1.  "Some say we're moving too quickly to pass this legislation. I say this legislation is long overdue," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. "We simply cannot wait."      "Another week that we delay is another 100,000 or more people unemployed. I don't think we want that on our consciences," added David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.      2.  Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, suggested that Democrats were putting politics over progress. "It's not too late to make this a better bill, a bipartisan bill," Lewis said.      3.  Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said "where we have differences with the House Democrats is that the package just doesn't seem to reflect our priorities, nor the president's."      4.  In his remarks, Obama called on everyone to abandon a "sense of irresponsibility that prevailed from Wall Street to Washington."      And he said his administration would make certain the money would be spent in full view of the public, with ways to check where it goes and how it will be used — a nod to skepticism about the "size and scale" of the plan.      He left no doubt that he means to see it signed into law, and quickly — and that he thinks those who stand in the way will suffer the wrath of angry voters.       "All we can do, those of us in Washington, is help create a favorable climate in which workers can prosper, businesses can thrive, and our economy can grow," Obama said. "And that's exactly what I intend to achieve - soon."

20090128140049AAXQ6M3	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can an under 18/minor legally enter into a contract in the UK?	My situation: I got a service from someone, that costed me X amount per month. I paid for a few months, then didn't want to continue, so I left it.      Now I am being charged (Meaning he wants money off me) and taken to court over the price of the service I left (and didnt use) over those months. That in itself is debatable, as I believe the other party violated the contract on 2 different occasions, in 2 different ways. And broke the law once, on a different occasion (Counter-sue?).      When I signed up for the service, I entered into a contract/Terms Of Service. The contract itself says all parties must be under 18 to enter into it.      So, my questions are:      Assuming i did not get my parents consent, and this is all happening in the UK:      Can someone under 18 legally enter into a contract like that?   I know you can take someone under 18 to court, so:      Would being under 18, void the contract, meaning you were never actually entered into it in the first place? Thus completely jeapordising the other parties entire case, since it is entirely based on this contract.

It just snowed today and a couple of my friends and i decided to fool around in the snow. The mall has 2 parking lots, connected to each other. One was plowed and semi-full of cars. The other was not plowed. My friends and I began to do doughnuts and go about 25 through the snow, having fun. Not a soul or car was near us so no one was in danger. When we were done, we pulled out and headed for a traffic light. A cop that was in the parking lot tailed me out for quite sometime. Could the cop send a ticket to my home? or would he have pulled me over if i did something wrong?      thank you! im stressing out.

20090128145054AAytcJf	Politics & Government;Elections	Can you explain why the economy was fine until Democrats took control of congress in 2006?	Wednesday, January 28, 2009    GOP: Its plan is better jobs machine   House Republicans on Wednesday argued that their alternative stimulus program, heavy on tax cuts, would create nearly 3 million more new jobs than the $816 billion economic recovery plan being pushed by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats -- using the same methodology favored by President Obama's top economic advisers.    The substitute bill, sponsored by House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, would create 6.2 million jobs through 2010, according to its Republican backers, compared with just 3.2 million jobs claimed under the House Democratic bill to be voted on Wednesday evening.       Democrats rejected the analysis, saying the plan's reliance on tax cuts amounted to the same old song we always hear from Republicans, according to Rep. Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat.       But the analysis by the Ways and Means Republican staff relied on a formula used by Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to estimate that Republican-backed tax cuts of nearly $400 billion over the next few years would produce at least a 6.1 percent increase in GDP.       Using a jobs formula endorsed by Mrs. Romer and Jared Bernstein, now Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s top economic aide, that GDP boost translates into 6.2 million jobs over two years.       For half the cost, we can have twice the impact, said Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican.       The amendment was given virtually no chance of passage as Democrats expected to pass their version of the stimulus bill Wednesday evening. The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the stimulus program next week, and lawmakers want to have a bill to the president by mid-February.              http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan...

Has the US Federal government taken any steps to reduce the number of meaningless and non productive jobs within the government that are draining this country dry?      In Fiscal 007 just federal (not counting state, city and county) employees in all departments through theft, fraud and abuse stole 200 Billion dollars of taxpayer money.      This number comes for the Government Accountability Office who knows the employee name, department, amount taken and when. Not one penny has been recovered and no action taken against these employees.      This is the corruption of employees of the Federal Government not the elected politicians.

Would liberals see it as racism, If people who applied for welfare had to show proof of having a high school diploma or if they didn't have one they had to enroll in a high school degree/ GED programme within 3 months of being accepted into the welfare programme in order to continue receiving benefits. Would liberals consider this "racism"? If not, what would their problem be with this?      I thought this might be a good idea because many impoverished people in the US do not even have high school diplomas, and without a high school diploma there is little room to move anywhere in the career world. But if they got a high school diploma they would have a better chance of getting off of welfare eventually.

ACORN Is A Bad Seed   Something’s rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and…      ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.       ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.       ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for years—stretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.

I have had my eyes opened by this past Presidential campaign and continuing Presidency as to how some Americans think (politically).

Whom can not think or act for themselves and only respond off of emotion alone because they have no pure logic. Which isn't true. Is it fair to say that most Republicans think or act as Sean Hannity, Bill O' Reily, and Rush Limbaugh. They're not exactly a pretty picture of the GOP.

She is pregnant (4 weeks) by a guy who is 24 years old. Should she have been more of a parent? Yes So save the counseling. I'm not here for the because I agree. My questions are this. The 16 year old will be 17 in June. Is it possible if the girl keeps this child that the mother can make her give the baby up for adoption? Her mom does not want her to have this baby, but would feel better giving it up for adoption. Shes worried that if she makes arrangments for it to be adopted that at 17 when her daughter has it, she can decide to keep it. The girl has no responsibilities, has been on P.I.N.S, placed in homes for the past 2 years and obviously cant even take care of herself. Secondly, this scum of a 24 year old kid who got her pregnant. Is it possible to have him arrested with no proof? I mean she's pregnant by him, but proving it would be quite difficult i believe unless she has the kid. Please help me out so I can point her in the right direction. Also if anyone knows the answer to this last question it would be great. She has medicaid and was wondering if she decided to abort the baby does medicaid cover it? I was told not unless its rape or incest but this baby is technically a statutory rape case. Thanks for yiour answers in advanced.

20090128145259AAgOrYG	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it illegal for your employer to force you to payback money missing from the store? ?	There have been instances when money has gone missing from the register at my job. My manager has forced all employees working that day to pay it back out of pocket. In these instances my manager has had no proof that anyone working that day took the money. On most of these occasions the money has turned up later in a deposit due to mathematical miscalculations. When asked to had over the money out of pocket we have been forced into a position where our job is on the line, and if we refuse to do so we will be terminated. The whole situation seems shady to me, so I want to know if what my manager is requesting of us is in fact illegal. I also want to add, that I do not know if this is a company wide practice. Judging by the way it is handled  I don't believe it is. There is no paper work or claim filled when it occurs. It happens very unprofessionally. Also, the company I work for is not a small company.

20090128103845AAy832h	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you agree with the argument that staunchly opposes ANY kind of bailout?	 http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...       Most of Washington has reached quick consensus: Government must do something big to shock the economy, and it should cost between $800 billion and $900 billion.      But dissident economists and investment professionals offer a much different take: Most of Washington is dead wrong.      Instead of fighting over what should go in the economic stimulus bill, pitting infrastructure spending against tax cuts and contractors against contraceptives, they say lawmakers should be fighting against the very idea of any economic stimulus at all. Call them the Do-Nothing Crowd.      “The economy was too big. It was all phantom wealth borrowed from abroad,” says Andrew Schiff, an investment consultant at Euro Pacific Capital and a card-carrying member of the stand-tall-against-the-stimulus lobby. “All this stimulus money is geared toward getting consumers spending and borrowing again. But spending and borrowing were the problem in the first place.”      Washington has a habit of passing legislation in a crisis and suffering from morning-after regrets — the Iraq war, the Patriot Act and last year’s original bank bailout plan come to mind. So we thought it would be wise to air the views of the naysayers toward Washington’s latest consensus approach.

Because college admissions are focusing less on the SAT/ACT and more on GPA. Tough standards for students have ceased to benefit the students because the system is so flawed.

I used to vote 100% Republican, until I realized that I agreed with Barack Obama on a number of issues this election, and then Sarah Palin saled their fate, and I voted Democrat.      However, I am from Louisiana, and I face an interesting problem, which many people only wish they could face:      I am a big fan of Barack Obama   I am a big fan of Bobby Jindal.      Both of these men, in my opinion, truly have my best interest, and the interest of America as a whole, in mind. Even though they would both take different methods to help America, I feel Obama is a great President, and I feel Bobby Jindal would be a great President as well.         So next Presidential election, I face this great predicament: I actually get to vote FOR the candidate that I like best, instead of voting AGAINST the lesser of two evils, which I have done for so long (Palin, Kerry, Gore, etc.)      I'm so excited! What should I do? I can only hope Palin is nowhere around the ticket...Hopefully he will pick someone great like Guiliani or Romney as a running mate.

20090128101948AAJAsXk	Politics & Government;Politics	Does this mean anything to anybody?	I read this months ago, I have never seen anything about this on any news platform or on any forum. This is something about Obama that scares me.     "I work with a young leftist who is on some committee or something raising funds for Obama. I didnt get the chance to ask him what he thinks of Obamas muslim pastbut he came over to me and was showing me his personally-signed copy of audacity of hope - and I asked him what he thought of Obamas liberation theology church. He started backing up with his book, saying he doesnt like to get involved with religion - or peoples religions. And I said, well maybe you should look into it, because its marxist. Thats when he started walking really fast away from me. I left it right there, although Obamas church recently gave Louis Farrakhan the Dr. A Wright Jr. Trumpet award. Maybe I should have mentioned that, too. What Id really like to get around to talking about with this kid is - Odinga, Kenya and Obama.    Because its whats going on in Kenya that we should be watching.     It turns out that Raila Odinga, the communist, who has the support of the muslims who are killing people in Kenya- is Obamas cousin.    From Free Republic:    Obama and his paternal 1st cousin Odinga, wanted to bring the whole of Kenya under Sharia law. Obama campaigned for Odinga in August of 2006,just before he filed with the US Federal Elections Commission for his presidential candidacy.    The idea was simply to have the Luo tribe, mostly Muslims, to take over Kenya from the inheritors of colonial power, the Kikuyu, and bring the country under Sharia law, kick out the Western investors in the nation that had made it one of the most stable nations in Africa, and supplant those Western investors with wealthy Arab oil money.It all failed.Then Odinga yelled election fraud, and put his Luo Islamofascists into the streets of Nairobi to protest by murdering, raping and maiming Kikuyu people, including the recent burning alive of a church full of Christians.    If Obama and Odinga had succeeded, the next step in the plan would be for president Obama to help Odinga consolidate his power over Kenya by international recognition and trade. That will NOT happen. Obama wanted to expand Islamofascism, and annex Kenya to Somalia and the Sudan in an Islamofascist axis.    This puts both Obama and Odinga right up there in a pantheon with Idi Amin.Obama hates America, and the basis for Americas wealth. His actions show this.  [youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?...    Ask yourself why black America generally has been ambivalent about Obamas candidacy. They know the nature of this creature. Whitey is simply catching up, but will whitey do so in time?  See: How Obama and 1st paternal cousin Odinga Tried to Bring Kenya Under Sharia Law and Failed, The Dose    Obama, the Muslim thing and why it matters    Obama Odinga Atlas sighting    The Kenyan Jihad    Kenya, Islam and Obama Hussein    Raila Odinga has, in his own words, a close personal friendship with Barack Hussein Obama Junior.When Obama went to Kenya in August of 2006, he was hosted by Raila and spoke in praise of him at rallies in Nairobi: Obamas bias for his fellow Luo was so blatant that a Kenya government spokesman denounced Obama during his visit as Railas a?stooge.a?  Atlas has some important questions in her why it matters piece. Obama went to the madrassas in Jakarta and was a practicing muslim. His father was a muslim. His stepfather was a muslim. In Islam, no matter what your mother is, if your father is a muslim, so are you. Obama understands and knows what is in the koran. Did he leave Islam, and if so, why the silence? If he left Islam, that would qualify him as an apostate, but I havent seen calls for his death-which we most certainly would have seen in his very public candidacy for the presidency. Is Obama practicing kitman or takeyya?     Melanie Phillips thinks this is worrying; and perhaps an indication of what he means when he talks about being the candidate for change.    His cousin Odinga is partnering with Islamic jihadists who are behind the violence in Kenya over his loss at the polls. Odinga is connected with Al Qaeda, for crying out loud. We should be asking question after question of Obama and his campaign, because the next president - like it or not-will be a war president. And we should not have someone in the highest office in our land who would not only be the first muslim president, but who would aggressively enable our jihadist enemies; as their ally.    Whos to say Obama wouldnt aggressively work to install sharia and fulfill CAIRs dream for the US, just like his cousin is attempting to do in Kenya? All indications arethats exactly the change that hes looking for.    Odinga, Obama and the lack of courage    [youtube]MAZVeM1zdDo[/youtube]    In this video, an Arab political science professor in Gaza says Arabs in the Middle East favor Obama for president. From

The press was assigned the special "watchdog" category by our founding fathers - a non-government, private category - to examine every detail of our politicians to keep them honest.  Yet we hear talk of the elimination of talk radio under the cover of the Fairness Doctrine.      They did their best to uncover scandal during the Bush days - looking in every crevice for dirt, torture, and scandal but they seem to have giggly chills going up their legs with the new admin.      So far we haven't heard much about what's in the new "stimulus package", except for a few leaks about pure pork.  So who's going to investigate the details?

I'm currently applying to schools there, but if I do not get into school, I'm planning on attempting to return on another one year visitor visa so I can live with my partner until I can get de facto relationship status (same-sex immigration - requires no less than one year of cohabitation). I'm really trying to be in the country for him, so I'm having a hell of a time being able to get permanent residency without a college degree, although I have about two and a half years under my belt.      I knew you could extend your current work and holiday visa (462) if you worked as a seasonal agriculture worker for up to three months, but I wasn't sure if you could reapply for one if it expires. Anyone know my other options? I wouldn't mind doing seasonal labor, but I wasn't sure if I'm even eligible for that once my visa expires.      Thanks!

20090225081328AARt2hA	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Count made up time toward FMLA?	Hi.  My questions relate to intermittent FMLA.  We have an employee that is pregnant and takes time off for appointments.  She normally schedules them over her 1 hour paid lunch time.      My question is two-fold.  The first is related to what happens if the appointment runs over and she's gone 1 hr and 30 minutes.  I believe that normally she'd have to count that 30 minutes toward FMLA.  Do we need to count down to whatever increment of time our timekeeping system processes or what increment they are allowed to take other paid time of in?  We calculate work time to the quarter hour, but employees can only take PTO in a minimum of 4 hour increments.  Which superceeds?  If it's the 4 hours, do we not count time unless it reaches 4 hours?      The second and most important part of my question is with regard to counting FMLA time if she makes up the work.  If she stays an extra 30 minutes to make up the time she missed at the doctor, does she have to count that time toward FMLA?      10 points to anyone that can answer at least question #2 and provide a link.

20090128141501AA3UgNH	Politics & Government;Politics	Christian Republicans, why do so many of you selectively follow your religion's ideals?	If I described myself to you, you would probably peg me as a republican. I'm fairly wealthy, I'm a white male, I think that the government should be as uninvolved in our lives as possible, and I believe in the concept of working hard for what you want in life...      However, I find it frustrating to see so many republicans who so avidly quote "Thou shalt not kill." as a cry out against abortion, while ignoring "Love thy neighbor" as they refuse to help their fellow Americans in need.       I know that most democrats disagree with republicans and the religious right, but are there any other people out there like me who would change parties were it not for this connection between church and state?

20090128143631AArbYvw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My ex band is holding my PA equipment hostage...?	SHORT VERSION...We were a band of 4. 2 members decided to quit and keep the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for and the band equipment fund has not fully paid me back for.      LONG VERSION... We had paying gigs scheduled and needed PA equipment so we could play the shows.  We agreed that they money we made from the shows would go to pay for this equipment.  I put the equipment on my credit card back in August.  After putting some money towards the equipment they got flaky and stopped paying me for the equipment and justified it using very fuzzy math.  I still owe money on said equipment.      After a show in December they packed up the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for (it's a PA head valued at $500 new 6 months ago).  After ignoring my phone calls for they called me to inform me that they want to quit the band. They said "so what are we going to do about the PA?" -expecting compensation since they put money into the band fund to pay for part of it. They say that they have someone who will buy it for $350.  I'm not paying them to get back something I paid for.       These guys canceled shows ($$$), alienated fans ($$$), and were overall crappy musicians who didn't practice or put in much effort ($$$$).  In short they screwed us in more ways than one and cost us way more money than they put in.  They only have put in about $150 each if the money from shows was slip equally rather than being put towards the equipment.  However, they would have made NOTHING if I didn't buy the equipment.      Any suggestions??? What legal recourse do I have if they sell it, break it, or if I call the cops and they claim that they don't have it? Am I screwed?

How much money do you think would be sufficient to fund for the research of the environmental and human effects of a possibly dangerous element...? Mind you this would be funded by the federal government.   The element I was referring to is Tungsten. It was previously thought to be safe, but new studies have shown that it affects reproduction and reproduction organs in earthworms, and negatively affects the growth of plants. It also may be that tungsten can go into the ground water supply. Levels of tungsten are not checked because the water companies do not have to check for it. Recently tungsten has been added onto a list by a government Department ( I don't remember the name) as an emerging threat.

20090128142851AASOaTU	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it possible to have an entire state committed?	Essentially, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has decided that for legal purposes of identification, a person's actual sex is meaningless. The gender "you consider yourself to be" is now officially used. This is madness. But it's now the state policy.       A man using a women's restroom or women's locker room would now show police a legal, official Massachusetts identification that he "is a woman". He could get this on the basis of "the gender he considers himself to be" with the agreement of a "medical provider". A male elementary school teacher can start coming to school wearing women's clothes and using the girls' rest rooms or locker rooms. And this will extend everywhere throughout society, in businesses, public accommodations, schools, and everywhere else.      This is just the latest step of the radical homosexual movement. Next they'll move on to the even more far-reaching "Transgender Rights and Hate Crimes" bill being filed in the legislature again this session.

Hello all,      Without going into the issue too much, i own my own business, which has been going very well. Recently i have another business owner make claims against me which are untrue. She hired a private investigator, and together through Facebook of all things have been contacting one by one all my friends and asking them questions about this false claim. Obviously since this claim is untrue these people do not know what is going on, however this has bought me under scruteny of all my friends as my name, my business name and a few other of my friends names have been used when asking questions of these other people.      It is all very confusing and very frustrating. I have contacted both the Lady who is accusing me and the Private Investigator, requesting us to sit down to discuss things as they have not come to me about the situation yet, i have not been asked any questions or been given a chance to proove myself innocent, but instead have goine straight to my friends and family and have been using my name.      As you would guess this is incredibly embarrassing for both myself and my family and this is a serious claim they are putting against me, however untrue!!!!      After talking on the phone with these people they keep agreeing to talk with me prior to talking to any of my other friends or family, and i have asked they they stop using my name in their questioning, hey have always agreed to this and say they will get back to me the folloeing day after talking to each other, which they never do. The next phone call i revieve is from another friend telling me they have just spoken to them.      I am at my wits end as these claims are untrue, however some of my friends are not seeing it that way, seeing as though i am under investigation.      Sorry for the long winded question. But basically can a PI be taken for deformation of character since i have asked him to stop using my name and business name, and friends names and to come and talk to me first?      What can i do?      Thankyou in advance

20090128152108AAaTCdn	Politics & Government;Politics	Does it take a tragedy for Americans to be united?	On 9/11, terrorists threatened our nation. Black, white, RED, and BLUE, we all felt the same sadness, fear, and loss. TOGETHER we showed our strength and resilience to the world. Does it really have to take a tragedy to bring Americans together?       Personally, I am humiliated by the comments I am seeing here-- from both democrats and republicans. I actually have seen people hope for Obama's failure.  Do people realize that this is wishing for the failure of America?       Am I the only one who thinks that we are Americans first-- not democrats and republicans?
