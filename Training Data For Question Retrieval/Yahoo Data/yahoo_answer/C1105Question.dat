But anyways, I just have a few questions for the cosmetologists out there.      *Annually with tips and everything how much do you make?   *What was schooling like? And how did you pick the right one?   *Do you learn how to do fake nails or is that the manicurist course?   *Do you still love what you do or do you wish you went down a different path?      And any tips and answers are appreciated:)   Oh and I'm a senior in high school so I'm crunched on time to make decisions.

I've recently come across several people who have suggested me persuing a modeling career and after watching and reading things about photoshoots, runways, and extreme tallness i'd like to. But for me (13) the whole thing just sounds fun, but not what I'd consider "serious"      I swim, and like my junk-food which results in a generally muscular figure. I'm 130 lbs and am about 5'9'' tall (almost 5'10''). However I'm having mixed feelings about even thinking of attempting this.      So, coming back to my initial question. Can you model without being completely serious?

I'm going to order a Sailor hat from eBay quite soon, but I'm unsure on how to make my outfit pop. Does anybody have any ideas on jewelery and accessories I could wear with it? Or any places I could purchase some nautical items for my outfit? I'm not going to stick to what I've said completely, but I've just gathered them together for the basis of my outfit. I'm looking for inspiration and creative ideas as everyone is going in the same theme, and I'd like to look a cut above the rest.      Thanks in advance! xxx
