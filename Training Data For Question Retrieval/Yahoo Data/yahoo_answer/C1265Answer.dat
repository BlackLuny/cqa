The addition of heat energy, due to this compactedness, is translated to Kinetic Energy (greater vibrational motion) which is immediately transferred to neighbouring molecules and the Heat Transfer by Conduction is Achieved.<br>  <br>  Conduction is the Fastest form of Heat transfer.<br>  Convection, heat transfer in fluids (Liquids and Gases) is due to rising currents of fluid due to decrease in Density. Cooler fluid moves in to replace the rising current of fluid. This too, is heated and rises and a circulatory motion is set up within the Fluid.<br>  Radiation, the slowest of the Heat Transfer processes will only heat substances 'or bodies" in the direct path of the Heat Rays.<br>  Stand in front of a fire on a cold night.

All the gases have localised electrons, meaning they don't move around. Even if we boiled ionic and metallic substances which do conduct electricity, the gases would diffuse into the atmosphere, giving no continual flow. In addition, the composition of covalently bonded molecules in air would make it difficult for any others to conduct electricity.

bR4BgFLlaa	1: <br>  connective <br>  epithelial <br>  muscular <br>  nervous <br>  Epithelial tissue covers the body surface and forms the lining for most internal cavities. The major function of epithelial tissue includes protection, secretion, absorption, and filtration. The skin is an organ made up of epithelial tissue which protects the body from dirt, dust, bacteria and other microbes that may be harmful. Cells of the epithelial tissue have different shapes as shown on the student's worksheet. Cells can be thin, flat to cubic to elongated. <br>  <br>  Connective tissue is the most abundant and the most widely distributed of the tissues. Connective tissues perform a variety of functions including support and protection. The following tissues are found in the human body, ordinary loose connective tissue, fat tissue, dense fibrous tissue, cartilage, bone, blood, and lymph, which are all considered connective tissue. <br>  <br>  There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle is a voluntary type of muscle tissue that is used in the contraction of skeletal parts. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of internal organs and blood vessels. It is an involuntary type. The cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart and is involuntary in nature. <br>  <br>  Nerve tissue is composed of specialized cells which not only receive stimuli but also conduct impulses to and from all parts of the body. Nerve cells or neurons are long and string-like.<br>  <br>  In tissues the simplest combination is called a membrane, or a sheet of tissues which cover or line the body surface or divide organs into parts. Examples include the mucous membrane which lines body cavities. Tissues combine to form organs. An organ is a part of the body which performs a definite function. The final units of organization in the body are called systems. A system is a group of organs each of which contributes its share to the function of the body as a whole.<br>  <br>  Each of the structures which comprise the skin has one or more functions, many of which play a vital role in maintaining good health. Those which may be affected in acne, eczema or psoriasis are also described in a little more detail.<br>  <br>  3:<br>  A primary purpose of the skin is to provide a flexible, protective shield between us and the outside world. This is made possible by the layers of dead, flattened epithelial cells which prevent micro-organisms and chemicals from entering the body, and by the waterproofing effect of the keratin, fats and oils. These protective benefits would not last long, however, if skin cells were not replaced. This happens by a process of continuous cell division in the basal layer, nutrients being provided by the blood vessels in the papillary layer. As the cells move towards the outer surface, they lose their nuclei, gradually become keratinised, and die.<br>  <br>  Linked with cell division is the process of wound healing. We need not discuss this complex process in detail, but it involves the inward migration of cells such as fibroblasts and white blood cells, the release of special chemicals called growth factors that stimulate the repair process, and increased cell division of the epidermis to provide a new, intact surface layer. Redness and swelling around a wound indicates that the blood vessels are enlarged and ‘leaky’ – a reflection of inflammation and an immune response which contribute to the removal of dead and damaged tissue.<br>  <br>  Temperature regulation is also an important activity of the skin. The large amounts of liquid lost during perspiration evaporate from the surface and cool it. Also, blood vessels open up to dissipate heat when you are overheated – hence the pink flush when you are warm – and contract when the body needs to conserve heat. Sweat also contains waste materials such as urea and up to 1 gramme of waste nitrogen may be lost through the skin every hour.<br>  <br>  4:<br>  Smoking can damage our body, For Example, your lungs, your brain, and your heart. The poisonous chemicals in a cigarette can cause death. Think about this, if you smoke you won't be able to run fast or jump as high if you can't breathe properly. Another problem is that you can get addicted easily by one of the chemicals called Nicotine. Nicotine can make you feel hyper sometimes. The more you smoke, the more you want to continue to smoke.

The Human Body is made up of many systems that work together to perform complex tasks on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  QUESTION 3:<br>  Skin performs the following functions:<br>  <br>     1. Protection: an anatomical barrier from pathogens and damage between the internal and external environment in bodily defense; Langerhans cells in the skin are part of the adaptive immune system.<br>     2. Sensation: contains a variety of nerve endings that react to heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury; see somatosensory system and haptics.<br>     3. Heat regulation: the skin contains a blood supply far greater than its requirements which allows precise control of energy loss by radiation, convection and conduction. Dilated blood vessels increase perfusion and heat loss while constricted vessels greatly reduce cutaneous blood flow and conserve heat. Erector pili muscles are significant in animals.<br>     4. Control of evaporation: the skin provides a relatively dry and impermeable barrier to fluid loss. Loss of this function contributes to the massive fluid loss in burns.<br>     5. Aesthetics and communication: others see our skin and can assess our mood, physical state and attractiveness.<br>     6. Storage and synthesis: acts as a storage center for lipids and water, as well as a means of synthesis of vitamin D by action of UV on certain parts of the skin.<br>     7. Excretion: sweat contains urea, however its concentration is 1/130th that of urine, hence excretion by sweating is at most a secondary function to temperature regulation.<br>     8. Absorption: Oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide can diffuse into the epidermis in small amounts, some animals using their skin for their sole respiration organ. In addition, medicine can be administered through the skin, by ointments or by means of adhesive patch, such as the nicotine patch or iontophoresis. The skin is an important site of transport in many other organisms.<br>     9. Water resistance: The skin acts as a water resistant barrier so essential nutrients aren't washed out of the body.<br>  <br>  QUESTION 4:<br>  Second hand smoke causes serious health problems. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to get ear infections, bronchitis and lung infections. They are more likely to die in house fires and are 4 times more likely to be a victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.The non smoking spouse of a smoker has a 20% increase risk of getting cancer and a 30% higher risk of developing heart disease.

DU8zxsKRaa	For your first question - yes.<br>  <br>  For your second question -- you're close.<br>  <br>  The first step where you have:<br>  <br>  x^18 / x^24<br>  <br>  is correct, but the constants are not coefficients that can be cancelled out by finding the LCM.  These are the exponents.  So the factors that are able to be cancelled are the x's.<br>  <br>  You likely know this rule:<br>  <br>  a^x * a^y = a^(x+y)<br>  <br>  The product of two numbers of the same base when multiplied toghether is the same as the sum of the exponents.<br>  <br>  For the same reason, when you divide, you subtract the exponents:<br>  <br>  a^x / a^y = a^(x - y)<br>  <br>  So to simplify what you have, subtract the exponents:<br>  <br>  x^18 / x^24<br>  x^(18 - 24)<br>  x^-6<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  1/(x^6)|`|bTHhpGanaa	the first one is correct<br>  the second one is simplified to 1/x^6  (24-18)|`|LtiOm442aa	1st ones right and for future reference just work out the original and your answer on a calculator, if they both come out the same answer you're right!<br>  2nd one is wrong. Up to x^18/x^24 it was right. You can't cancel the 18 with the 24 because they're powers, you can only cancel if they are multiplied.eg.18x/24x=3/4(Note the x's will cancel also) In your case you need to remember your law of indices: a^b/a^c=a^(b-c). So in your case you get: x^(18-24)=x^-6=1/x^6. Another way to look at it is you have 18 x's on top and 24 below so the 18 on top cancel with 18 on the bottom leaving 6 at the bottom.ie.1/x^6<br>  Hope this helped|`|sieisRAMaa	Your first answer is correct, good job.  Your second answer is almost correct, you did everything right until the very end.<br>  <br>  when you hvae (x^18)/(x^24), you do not simplify by making them a fraction.<br>  <br>  lets look at (x^5)/(x^3).  This is the same as (x*x*x*x*x)/(x*x*x). x/x=1 so we can do that three times and are left with x*x=x^2.<br>  <br>  So we get the formula, (x^n)/(x^t)=x^(n-t) where n and t are constants.<br>  <br>  So your answer would be x^(18-24). which is x^-6.  or 1/x^6.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, good luck!|`|xKWeKLOwaa	1.

When you're growing up, the balence between them is that more osteoblasts are produced, creating more bone, but once you reach around 30 years old, the balence alters in the other direction, so in actual fact, more bone is being worn away than being formed, which is why you become shorter when you're old.|`|ogRTCBt1aa	because life is too short<br>  :)|`|5apGkgS9aa	because the bone cells have  chemical messages sent to them to stop mutiplying..|`|4ZCclzKkaa	That's what "adulthood" means - that your body (the bones part anyway) stops growing.

ii0hMr0caa	If you leave mild steel in contact with air and damp, the surface will oxidize (go rusty). If we put a coating over this wire that excludes the oxygen and damp, rusting will not occur. One popular and robust method is to coat the mild steel with another metal that melts at a lower temperature, it could be copper such as the coating on MIG welding wire. or more commonly Zinc. The mild steel is cleaned in an acid bath to remove all surface contaminants and is then fed through a bath of molten zinc, this is called galvanizing, see it used on fence wire, roofing sheets, water pipes, electrical conduit and trunking and cable tray among many many other applications.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	Galvanizing is the process of coating a metal with a noncorrosive coating to prevent your important metal from corroding away.

lljK4HfHaa	I studied that for my O-level exams.. but i forgot it all now..<br>  <br>  Maybe this will help? :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_synthesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_syn...</a><br>  <br>  Ok so this is copy-paste from a bio book i got :<br>  <br>  The stages of protein synthesis :<br>  <br>  There are 3 stages in the process by which the info of the gene is used to determine how the protein molecule is constructed.<br>  <br>  STAGE 1 :<br>  occurs in the nucleus where a complementary copy of the code is made by the building of a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is called transcription and the enzyme is RNA polymerase. One stand of the DNA, the coding stand, is used as the template.<br>  <br>  Once the mRNA strand is formed it leaves the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane and passes to tiny structures in the cytoplasm called ribosoms where the information can be read and is used.<br>  <br>  STAGE 2:<br>  the amino acids are activated for protein synthesis by combining with short lengths of different sort of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA). The activation occurs in the cytoplasm. It is the RNA that translates a three-base sequence into an amino acid sequence.<br>  <br>  All the tRNAs take the shape of a clover-leaf, butthere is a different tRNA for each of the 20 amino acids involved in protein synthesis. At one end of each tRNA molecule is a site where a particular amino acid can be joined. At the other end, there is a sequence of three bases called an anticodon. This anticodon is complementary to the codon of mRNA that codes for the specific amino acid.<br>  <br>  The amino acid is attached to its tRNA by an enzyme. These enzymes are specific to the particular amino acids (and types of tRNA) to be used in protein synthesis. The specificity of the enzyme is a way of ensuring the correct amino acids are used in the right sequence.<br>  <br>  STAGE 3:<br>  in stage 3, a protein chain is assembled, one amino acid residue at a time. The process is called translation. Tiny organelles called ribosomes move along the messenger RNA 'reading' the codons from a 'start' codon. In the ribosomes, complementary anticodons on the amino acid-tRNAs slot into place and are temporarily held in position by hydrogen bonds.<br>  <br>  While held there, the amino acids of neighbouring amino acid-tRNAs are joined by a peptide linkages. This frees the first tRNA which moves back into the cytoplasm for re-use. Once this is done, the ribosome moves on to the next mRNA codon. The process continues until a 'stop' codon occurs.|`|D4xmy588aa	Genetics is something i never understood<br>  <br>  its toooooooooooo hard|`|nS7koC7Oaa	Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) correspond to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.<br>  <br>  Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.[21]<br>  <br>  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.[20] rRNA is extremely abundant and makes up 80% of the 10 mg/ml RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cytoplasm.<br>  <br>  Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is found in many bacteria and plastids. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Genome of an organism is its whole hereditary information and is encoded in the DNA (or, for some viruses, RNA). This includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	Kar Khanigi Tan khod ko!<br>  <br>  LOL Oky you didn't understand your own language!

gCn6bXAFaa	There is wide variation in social structure in ground nesting bees, even within a single species.  Ground nesting bees in the genus Andrena are most likely to be solitary.  Bees in the family Halictidae may be solitary but frequently drift into higher forms of social organization like these: <br>  <br>  aggregations: many solitary nests nearby.<br>  <br>  Communal:  Many mated females share a burrow but there is minimal division of labor.

PFTB5Yt7aa	I thank you for your maturity. Not many people are as open as you. <br>  Any way let me answer you accordingly. <br>  <br>  1)How come every life form contains seed to reproduce after its own kind?<br>  <br>  Not all life on earth uses eggs or seeds to propagate. In fact bacteria and other simple organisms use a process called Mitosis to create identical daughter cells to the original. (Imagine cloning or creating a photocopy)<br>  <br>  2)  Why does life not continue to begin by same original origin?<br>  <br>  Well this is a trickier question, first of all you have to classify what is life. In this case lets just say that life is a very simple self replicating molecule (No cell wall, no mitochondria, nothing but a strand of self replicating information.) Now that we know what life is we can properly answer. <br>  Truth be told we don't know how life started on the early earth, so we can't say for shure why life isn't starting now. But a very simple hypothesis as to why no new life isn't being created is because that the current life on the planet would out compete it for both resources and space, and with neither of these that new life would be extinct within moments of its creation. <br>  <br>  3)If all life forms began in this way, how come there are so many different ways of reproduction amongst the plant/animal kingdom?<br>  <br>  Well suppose that evolution is true and that all cells started from the same parent cell. As that cell created coppies of itself, some of its daughter cells would, through natural mutation of the genenome, be better at surviving in an than others. So after millions or billions of years, some cells found that they were best suted to live in an environment so to prevent further change in their genome they self propogated like plants. While some cells found that the best way for their genes to survive would be through breeding and so mating creatures like the animals were created. <br>  <br>  P.S  I know its long and I hope this answers your question.|`|KRJziwIHaa	necessity is the catalyst of evolution.  this means that the environment selects for certain traits in a species.  the environment has changed so much over time and is so different as you move across the globe that many forms have arisen in organisms.  and if you simplify reproduction of species, most need a male and a female to produce offspring.  and on a molecular scale this reproduction is very similar in most species (plant and animal), especially  in the aspect of cell division and meiosis.<br>         so the type of environment and the niche an organism takes all factor into the organism|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	> "Darwin presupposed in his world famous 'The origin of species' that man evolved over millions of years from a primordial germ - into apes - then into man."<br>  <br>  Actually, no he didn't. The Origin of Species hardly mentions man at all: that is "The Descent of Man", which he wrote in 1871 (12 years after Origin was published).<br>  Also "presupposed" means "to assume some truth without proof" (wiktionary); the correct term would be "hypothesised".<br>  <br>  > "Ok so if it is supposed that man began as micro-organism/bacteria, [1]how come every life form contains seed to reproduce after its own kind?"<br>  <br>  ??? I'm not sure what you are asking here - but you seem to be missing the part of evolution which described divergence, or branching. Different populations of organisms diverge from each other evolutionarily, and will eventually form new, separate species.<br>  <br>  > "[2]Why does life not continue to begin by same original origin?"<br>  <br>  This question is not covered by evolution, which only describes how life changes with time (not how it began); that field is "abiogenesis", a totally seperate area to evolutionary biology.<br>  <br>  But to answer the question from abiogenesis, there are several reasons:<br>  [1] any "new" life-forms would obviously have to compete for resources with the existing life-forms. We've had 4 billion years to adapt to exploit our environment, and would therefore out-compete any newly-arising life-forms.<br>  [2] the conditions hypothesised to be conducive for the origin of life no longer exist on earth. for one thing, there is now oxygen in the atmosphere (which there was not on early earth, as there was no photosynthesis), and it would poison the chemical reactions required.<br>  <br>  > "[3] If all life forms began in this way, how come there are so many different ways of reproduction amongst the plant/animal kingdom?"<br>  <br>  Because different species evolved their own methods of reproduction. And, in point of fact, there aren't really that many different forms of reproduction: there are only two (asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction between two partners). These are the two basic methods; everything else is just detail.<br>  <br>  > "I am still gonna hope for genuine answers from people who know what they are talking about and are confident in their belief in evolution."<br>  <br>  The correct term is "acceptance" of evolution. Belief requires faith, while acceptance only requires evidence. Evolution is supported by evidence, so you either accept it or not.|`|De4vgWXPaa	Evolutionary theory is an explanation, not a belief system.  Come up with a better explanation for the evidence, and the theory will be rejected.<br>  <br>  <<[1]how come every life form contains seed to reproduce after its own kind?>><br>  <br>  As Darwin pointed out, all progeny of all organisms vary ever so slightly from their parent(s).  This eventually results in taxa such as species being fuzzy concepts with ill-defined boundaries rather than strictly defined ones.  Natural selection tends to result in beneficial mutations spreading through subsequent generations and, eventually, the accumulation of changes can result in a new species emerging incrementally.<br>  <br>  "Kinds" (whatever they're supposed to be) don't have fixed boundaries.<br>  <br>  <<[2]Why does life not continue to begin by same original origin?>><br>  <br>  The origin of life (if any) is completely irrelevant to evolutionary theory.  That concerns the origin of species, and that process continues.<br>  <br>  <<[3] If all life forms began in this way, how come there are so many different ways of reproduction amongst the plant/animal kingdom?>><br>  <br>  They evolved.<br>  <br>  <<I am still gonna hope for genuine answers from people who know what they are talking about and are confident in their belief in evolution.>><br>  <br>  Again, it's an explanation for the available evidence, not a belief concept.<br>  <br>  <<I am not trying to catch anyone out here and although it may be a slim hope...>><br>  <br>  Wow, what a demonstration of maturity (irony intended).

KMQnebmTaa	I agree with everything Jax said, but would add the following:<br>  The vector field here has the form of 2(i+j) + yk.  Ignore the k component for the moment.  The fact that the i and j components are equal means that the vectors (or at least their projection down into the x,y plane) are pointing directly outwards -- i.e. radially.  That makes computing the dot product extremely easy, because the vector points in exactly the same direction as the unit normal to the surface.  Another way to say this is that the vector field has cylindrical symmetry:  it remains unchanged if you rotate around the z-axis.  That's what makes cylindrical coordinates such a natural choice, here.|`|fLHs5dd1aa	Think about the boundaries defined here- an infinite stack of circles (x^2 + y^2 = 19) with planes at z=0 and z=4. That sounds like a cylinder with radius sqrt(19) and height 4 to me.<br>  <br>  Additional details:<br>  Cartesian coordinates can always be used, it's just a matter of convenience. Some problems in vector calculus are unbelievably tedious in Cartesian coordinates but take only a few lines in spherical or cylindrical. Part of the finesse of vector calc is knowing when to use which system.

mqV9TOv0aa	T3 (cytomel) (Liothyronine sodium) <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=What+are+the+effects+of+the+drug+T3&page=1&qsrc=0&zoom=%3CKW%3ET3%3C%2FKW%3E+and+Thyroid%7C%3CKW%3ET3%3C%2FKW%3E+and+Cocaine%7CNormal+Level+of+%3CKW%3ET3%3C%2FKW%3E+in+Thyroid&ab=2&u=http%3A%2F%2Fbodybuilding.elitefitness.com%2Ft3-cytomel-liothyronine-sodium-remarkable-fat-burning-drug-and-where-get-it" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=What+are+the+ef...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Cytomel is the most common synthetic version of the T3 or triiodothyronine. T3 is not produced directly by the thyroid gland but by the thyroid-stimulating hormone or THS. THS is also responsible for the production of T4 or thyroxine.<br>  <br>  Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, such as Cytomel, are used for the treatment of obesity since they are effective fat-burning agents.<br>  Cytomel exerts its fat-burning ability via the following metabolic pathways and processes. <br>  <br>  Cytomel up-regulates the beta-2 adrenergic receptors in fat tissues. In lipolysis, or the breakdown of fat in fat tissues, the enzyme HSL (hormone sensitive lipase) plays a significant part. HSL controls the rate of lipolysis. For HSL to be activated, epinephrine and nonepinephrine (catecholomines) are necessary. These catecholomines bind to the beta-2 receptors, and thus when Cytomel up-regulates the beta-receptors, there is a corresponding increase in the ability of catecholomines to activate HSL, resulting to increased lipolysis.<br>  <br>  This drug is likewise known to increase the UCP-3 or uncoupling protein-3. This process significantly increases lipolysis. Further, Cytomel also stimulates growth hormone (GH) production, as substantiated by several studies. And since GH is a thermogenic, it contributes to this drug’s fat-burning action. This is why when athletes are using Cytomel they find no need to use HGH.<br>  <br>  Advantages of Cytomel therapy<br>  <br>  With AAS use, the suppression occurs even after the therapy is stopped, sometimes in periods of weeks or months (especially in cases of long-term use). The same thing is observed during insulin intake, whereby the pancreas (the organ responsible for insulin production) ceases its production of insulin. Such is not the case with exogenous T3 hormone therapy. Several studies have concluded that thyroid therapy does not cause prolonged suppression of thyroid normal production. Thyroid function is normalized just days after medication is discontinued. In other words, there is no thyroid shutdown due to T3 supplementation; there is only a down-regulation of thyroid output during therapy.<br>  <br>  Drawbacks of Cytomel therapy<br>  <br>  Side effects of this class of drug include tachycardia and atrial arryhtmias, bone resorption, and loss of lean muscle tissue. Secondary side effects include insomnia, diarrhea, and nausea. These adverse reactions are highly possible if the user takes high dosages.<br>  <br>  Notice that some of its major side effects relate to the cardiovascular system. This is because thyroid hormones have significant effects on cardiac structures (including cardiac muscles) and systems that alter cardiovascular hemodynamics.<br>  <br>  Hyperthyroidism increases virtually all cardiac functions including heart rate and contractility, diastolic relaxation, and rate of ventricular pressure development. This results to an increased cardiac output by as much as 250 percent. These physiological changes are (most likely) the consequences of an increase in the expression of ATP and a decrease in the expression of ATP’s inhibitor, phospholamban.<br>  <br>  Another drawback of Cytomel is its catabolic ability. When Cytomel exerts this ability on stored fats, this is an asset. However, this becomes a liability when it exerts this on bones and muscles. The negative result is bone resorption and muscle wasting (mentioned above). Moreover, this drug also diminishes GH’s nitrogen retention ability (although it stimulates GH’s production, as mentioned earlier).<br>  <br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  .|`|LF7C1Rzgaa	a T3 is just regular tylenol with a bit of codeine in it.<br>  <br>  It will do a great job or treating pain because codeine is an opiod (really strong). <br>  <br>  Taking T3s can make you constipated because it can make your bowels less active|`|Pu6EKr82aa	Dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, sedation, shortness of breath, vomiting

4Qgmvpdhaa	If just 1% of the world's population migrated to the Moon, that would provide enough natural emissions to build a nice atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Remember, all mammals which respire aerobically (breathe oxygen), give off 2 primary byproducts:  water vapor and CO2.  They also give off methane gas.  All 3 are potent greenhouse gases which can even out temperature extremes as well as protecting living things from cosmic rays and the photodissociation of water.<br>  <br>  Earth's MAGNETIC FIELD deflects COSMIC rays, while our ATMOSPHERE blocks out uv, gamma and x-rays. The geodynamo in the core of the Earth generates its magnetic field.<br>  <br>  Ideally, a series of 3 magnetic fields should be in place in order to live on the moon or on Mars, and to protect its waters--mobile, local and global magnetic fields:<br>  <br>  To create a "global" magnetic field on the moon or Mars, a Superconducting Magnetic Ring would have to be imbedded deep into the crust, about 200' deep. You'll need to have a Superconducting Magnet that meets these specifications: variable ramping up from 2 to 14 Tesla; quench recovery; ability to sustain a "persistent current" indefinitely; backup and failure protection; 24/7 monitoring system. Super Pulsed Fiber Lasers such as the Photonic's IPG laser will make lunar and Martian excavation projects a breeze compared to conventional drilling equipment: rocks will glow red hot and crumble.  The Superconducting Magnetic Ring would have to be placed in a HORIZONTAL position, for the correct N-S (North-South) alignment that is most similar to Earth's magnetic field alignment.<br>  <br>  On Earth, the magnetic field on the SURFACE is only 0.5 to 2.0 gauss, while near the CORE, it's approximately 100,000 gauss, or 10 Tesla. That's because magnetic flux varies as the Inverse CUBE of the distance, R. Use a fluxgate magnetometer to measure the magnetic field.<br>  <br>  A Samarium Cobalt magnet of 1 to 2 Tesla, imbedded 5' under a compressed dome will create "local" magnetic fields, protecting about 50 inhabitants from cosmic rays. Elongated bar magnets (200-300 gauss) strapped onto spacesuits will create a cosmic umbrella of "mobile" magnetic fields, deflecting cosmic rays while you walk and work. Eventually, a global magnetic field will be necessary in order to walk out of the dome and begin building an atmosphere.<br>  <br>  METHANE gas will create a blue/green color in the sky. Compost piles and farm/animal droppings are a natural source of methane.<br>  <br>  Then it's just a matter of building an ATMOSPHERE, which is literally, a piece of cake. All we have to do is build bakeries, restaurants and farms. That's because water vapor and CO2 are the 2 primary byproducts of COMBUSTION and AEROBIC RESPIRATION. That is, the more we eat, and the more active we are, the more water vapor, CO2 and Methane gas we add to a planet's atmosphere, 24/7. Pretty soon, it'll be flooding on the Moon and on Mars. Methane is 25x more potent at heating an atmosphere than CO2. Build a Fischer Tropsch reactor to make propane and other fuels.<br>  <br>  Funding for such projects may be obtained from the ISDC Conference 2009 (Int'l Space Development Conference).<br>  <br>  Bring a bunch of furry animals with you to "bioform" the planet, since all mammals (groundhogs, squirrels, gerbils, hamsters, lorises, lemurs, etc) give off water vapor, CO2 and methane gas. All 3 are potent greenhouse gases which can build a rich and thick atmosphere while balancing out temperature extremes. Just fill a silo with dry pet food, fill a crater with clean water and provide salt licks. You might also set up a dome for them when temperatures get extreme, or dig tunnels for them to go underground.<br>  <br>  Lunar CRATERS have to be filled with water, iron sulfate and phytoplankton. Thru photosynthesis, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is released, generating cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and OXYGEN. CCNs cling to water vapor and dust particles to create CLOUDS. Coal ashes can serve as dust, just use a fan to create some convection. Use an ozone generator to create ozone.  Use magnesium-enriched water to water the grass, since grass-fed cattle require magnesium for optimum growth.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	To answer seriously, I think you meant on the surface. The problem wouldn't necessarily be how many could fit, as the moon is about the size of the United States (China is the same size, and they have 1.5 billion people). <br>  The problem would be getting enough materials and workers up there to build a heck of a lot of those glass domes! It takes considerable money and effort to get materials to the International Space Station, so the moon may be more difficult, unless you could drop them with balloon protectors (the way the rovers land on Mars).<br>  With a time frame of 20-30 years (my estimate on how long we have until we ruin the environment), and the belief we would start right away and not wait until it was too late, and say that the United States was paying the bill like everything else on this planet, and we had a conservative cash flow: We could probably build cities or a megalopolis that would support 500 million (one and a half times the population of the United States. <br>  Many would die, because once a certain amount were brought to the moon city, no new recruits would be allowed to "contaminate" it. All "new" people would be born there.<br>  Materials would continue to be "mined" from the Earth, including destroying buildings and bridges and other structures (easier than mining raw materials).<br>  Trees and vegetation would also be striped from the Earth. You would need millions and millions of tree transplants to start out with an area that would cover at huge portion of the moon. Not to mention hundreds of millions of tons of soil or soil-like materials.<br>  Water would also need to be brought in, but eventually condensation and water works could be used to have renewable, fresh water.<br>  Basically we would strip the Earth even worse than an eco-disaster to make the moon Earth-like. More than 90% of the Earth population would still die.|`|24780d0fcf8e3b6b28ed98b77fa996d9aa	Well if the moon is 2.19 billion cubic KM and a person is about .0495 cubic M...then I think you could fit 442,424,242,424,242,000,000 people inside. Of course, you might have to liquefy a few of the people to get them all to fit in there with no airspace or anything. I'm sure this helps tremendously in your quest for knowledge. <br>  <br>  That's a totally different question than how many could survive on the surface though...There's no air up there...nothing to eat...so I think a lot of people could survive up there...for about 7 seconds each.|`|aY8oLCE7aa	Well that depends....if the moon as some believe is actually a hollow space station for aliens that is 100% unnaturally made, then it may hold alot.

A disadvantage is that you are only able to survive when oxygen is available.<br>  <br>  Anaerobic respiration allows organisms to live in environments that would otherwise be unlivable because they are able to make energy without the use of oxygen.

In anaerobic conditions, the downside is that less energy is produced, but it can be carried out when there is no oxygen present, so is less dependent on the surroundings.|`|1tiCB311aa	Aerobic respiration is the release of energy from glucose or another organic substrate in the presence of Oxygen. Aerobic means in air, but it is the Oxygen in the air which is necessary for aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is in the absence of air.<br>  <br>  Aerobic respiration takes place in almost all living things. It is easy to get rid of the Carbon Dioxide and excess water; this is excretion (the removal of the toxic waste products of metabolism), and maximum energy is released from the glucose.<br>  <br>  Some organisms can respire in the absence of air: this is anaerobic respiration. This does not release so much energy and it produces much more toxic waste products. However, if Oxygen is not available, anaerobic respiration is better than nothing. <br>  <br>  When this happens in our muscles we produce lactic acid which gives you cramp. The bacteria in milk produce the same chemical when they turn it sour. "Lactic" means "of milk". So lactic acid is the acid in sour milk. Yeasts produce alcohol which is also toxic. Eventually there will be so much alcohol that the yeast cannot survive.

ii0hMr0caa	David, in my answer I am going to assume that you are in the UK, if not my answer will still probably be good but I cannot be 100% positive as local regulations may have a thing or two to say on the subject.<br>  So you have no neutral and the heater is 3 phase. Firstly connect the three heating elements to match the supply voltage may be in star or delta(mesh) and connect the 3 phases to the appropriate points. Don't forget to connect the earth (CPC or Ground) to the exposed metallic parts of the heater. You don't say if it is fan assisted, if it is and you have connected the heater in star and it's a single phase fan motor, then connect the motor to the star point and any of the phases. This will cause a slight imbalance but the fan motor load will be small when compared with the heater load.<br>  If it is a single phase fan motor and you have connected the heaters in delta (mesh) then you are stuck, the only way out is to use a small transformer to reduce the line voltage down to the heater motor voltage.<br>  General, provided the 3 phase load is reasonably balanced, a neutral is not required in a 3 phase system, as in a balanced system, no current flows in the neutral. Use a 3 pole switch of the correct current rating to control the heater.<br>  Hope this helps|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Sorry. unless you know the system, (if it's three phase with no neutral, <br>  one of the phases might well be grounded, ['grounded delta']),  call in a competent electrician.<br>  If the load is always balanced, (no separate switching of the phases,<br>  a 'floating Wye tap' might be possible, but you don't give enough data , <br>  or know enough, to make the determination with certainty.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	The building does not have a neutral line?

I suggest you compare seawater with pure water, which has no buffering ability.  Get some of each (maybe a liter) and measure the pH (get some proper test strips, or if you have access to it, a pH meter).<br>  <br>  Then add the same amount of your acid sulfate soils (mixed well so that it has a uniform composition) to a certain amount (~100 mL, maybe) of each sample, mix well, and measure the pH again.<br>  <br>  Don't use up all your soil or all your water in one run, because you might have to do this a few times to get a handle on how much soil you need, how much water you need, amount of mixing, etc.

Since Pluto is now a dwarf planet, Neptune is the fathest planet.|`|3WLWmtrvaa	Pluto, planetary body counted as the ninth planet in the solar system after its discovery in 1930. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. The new IAU definition of a planet that changed Pluto's status is not accepted by some scientists, who continue to recognize Pluto as the ninth planet. Pluto revolves about the Sun once in 247.9 Earth years at an average distance of 5,880 million km (3,650 million mi). Pluto’s orbit is so eccentric that at certain points along its path Pluto is slightly closer to the Sun than is Neptune. Pluto is about 2,360 km (1,475 mi) in diameter, about two-thirds the size of Earth’s moon. Its composition links Pluto with Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), icy bodies found beyond Neptune in the outer solar system. The first space mission to explore Pluto, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, was launched in January 2006 and is scheduled to fly by Pluto in 2015. Pluto was named after the god of the underworld in Roman mythology. <br>  <br>  II  Observation from Earth <br>  <br>  Print this section<br>  All the information astronomers have on Pluto comes from observation through large telescopes. Pluto was discovered as the result of a telescopic search inaugurated in 1905 by American astronomer Percival Lowell, who postulated the existence of a distant planet beyond Neptune as the cause of slight irregularities in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Continued after Lowell’s death by members of the Lowell Observatory staff, the search appeared to end successfully in 1930, when American astronomer Clyde William Tombaugh found Pluto near where Lowell predicted another planet. Pluto became the ninth and most distant known planet in the solar system. However, the new planet posed a puzzle—Pluto appeared to be too small to affect the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Astronomers later detected errors in Lowell’s calculations and determined that the irregularities Lowell noted in the orbits do not exist. Clyde Tombaugh’s discovery of Pluto now is seen as a lucky accident that rewarded hard work. <br>  <br>  For many years very little was known about Pluto, but in 1978 astronomers discovered a relatively large moon orbiting Pluto at a distance of only about 19,600 km (about 12,180 mi) and named it Charon. The orbits of Pluto and Charon caused them to pass repeatedly in front of one another as seen from Earth between 1985 and 1990, enabling astronomers to determine their sizes accurately. Charon is about 1,200 km (750 mi) in diameter, making Pluto and Charon the parent-satellite pair closest in size to one another in the solar system. Some scientists have called Pluto and Charon a double planet. <br>  <br>  Pluto and Charon are tidally locked, meaning that they always keep the same face toward each other as they rotate. The lengths of Charon's “day” and “month” (one orbit) are thus the same as Pluto's “day” (6.4 Earth days). Charon's orbit is also retrograde (clockwise viewed from Pluto’s north pole). Although Charon is thought of as a satellite of Pluto, both in fact orbit around a common center of mass (called a barycenter) that is situated in space between the two bodies. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  More from Encarta<br>  College degrees and career training<br>  Explore online and on-campus programs.<br>  Learn how to get that degree!<br>  Recharge your brain<br>  We serve up a heady brew of Encarta's best.<br>  Check out Coffee Break.<br>  What do you want to be when you grow up?<br>  Spin a new career from your daydreams.<br>  Read how others have done it.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) detected two more small moons orbiting Pluto beyond Charon in late 2005. Follow-up observations with the HST in February 2006 confirmed the existence of the moons, which orbit Pluto in the same plane and same direction as Charon at distances of about 49,000 km (about 30,400 mi) and about 65,000 km (about 40,380 mi). The two moons later were officially named Nix and Hydra, in outward order. Additional observations with the HST in March 2006 showed that the two moons are the same color as Charon. The three moons have a neutral color, like Earth’s moon, and contrast with Pluto, which has a pinkish hue. <br>  <br>  The findings that all three moons orbit in the same plane and have the same color lend support to the theory that Pluto’s system formed from the collision of two large bodies about 4.6 billion years ago. Pluto survived the collision, according to this theory, and the material that afterward was thrown into orbit around Pluto eventually formed Charon and the two newly discovered moons. <br>  <br>  Every 248 years Pluto’s elliptical orbit brings it within the orbit of Neptune. Pluto last traded places with Neptune in 1979 and crossed back outside Neptune’s orbit in 1999. No possibility of collision exists, however, because Pluto's orbit is inclined more than 17.2° to the plane of the ecliptic (t|`|7RLY2itSaa	sedna

N7gOE1btaa	I have a degree in neuroscience.  So hopefully my opinion counts for something.  In terms of medicine, any biology or chemistry degree will help you.  For instance, most medical students find the brain to be the most challenging, thus a degree in neuroscience will help.  Generally speaking though, you are right, biochemistry is the most widely ranging major that will benefit you most.<br>  If you are interested in neurosurgery, then nothing you do in your undergrad will necessarily be beneficial.  This is because to become a neurosurgeon, you will have to complete 4 years of medical school plus engage in years of residency.  Your undergrad will only get you to medical school, not help you specialize.  Specializing will depend on your success and understanding while at medical school.|`|3b71155316600300855e8677f67125edaa	This is a tougher question than it seems:<br>  <br>  1.

To get into medical school - the major that will allow you to get the best GPA possible.<br>  <br>  3. To make a living if you don't get into medical school - something you enjoy and could see your self pursuing.<br>  <br>  To answer your question about neurosurgery, there is relatively little you can study in undergrad that will prepare you in any way for a residency after medical school.|`|szmXqI7Raa	Any major that has all the prereq's and suggested courses are best.  Make sure you get great grades.  Neurology might be a good place to start, just to make sure you like it before spending 4 years undergrad, 4 years med school and 7 plus years in residency before you even start your job.  Brain surgeons have a LONG residency, so make sure you really like it before you spend the next 15 years on it.  But then, you could always make Brain surgeon jokes in the elevator, so it balances out....

8V2KIPw3aa	Glycopyrrolate is anticholinergic meaning it antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine in the body. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter involved in the autonomic parasympathetic nervous system.  It also is present in the sympathetic nervous system, but only in sweat glands.  So the dermatologist's intention was to antagonize the sympathetic Ach receptors which would reduce the sweating.<br>  The side effects are caused by the Ach being blocked in the parasympathetic branch of the ANS.  The parasympathetic M3 receptors are located on salivary glands, urinary sphincters, GI system, etc.  Blocking the normal parasympathetic tone would cause dry mouth, constipation, difficulty urination, etc.  The parasympathetic M2 receptors are located on the heart.  By blocking the normal parasympathetic tone to the heart, the heart rate would increase.

But for your application all we do is put the primary of the transformer in the toothbrush base and the secondary in the toothbrush itself. The magnetic coupling is not great but it's only a few watts ans it works ok. Don't do this on big things using 100 watts or more as removing the secondary winding from the influence of the primary may cause a burn out of the primary.

sa8dElLZaa	Some plants are known only from a very specific region or habitat. Plants that are restricted to such specific areas are said to be endemic. Endemic plants are often associated with environmental distinctions or distinctive locales that are geographically isolated. For example, some endemics are associated with concentrations of unusual compounds in soil. Many milk vetches (Astragalus) are found in areas in which the soil has unexpectedly high concentrations of selenium. Isolated locales, such as islands or mountain ranges, often have endemic plants that have evolved and are found only in those places. Endemic plants are prized because of their identification with specific locales and generally narrow distributions.|`|O0qUkMz8aa	Endemic plants are native to a particular area and found nowhere else.  Often, the geographic area in question is fairly small; people are more likely to talk about a plant being endemic to a particular state than they are to talk about plants endemic to the US or North America
30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	When you run and jump, you take some time during which you do work which is converted into the kinetic energy of motion and then when you jump, it is this kinetic energy plus the work done in pusing the floor to jump, both get converted into potential energy giving you greater height of jump. When you just jump pushing the floor, the work done in that small instant of time by pushing the floor is less resulting in lesser height of jump. It has nothing to do with the momentum.

Some use external fertilization, some place the sperm directly inside the female just before she lays the eggs. Fertilization is accomplished by passing sperm, usually in packets (with the male grasping the female and using a reproductive organ slightly similar in function to, but not a true penis) to the female's reproductive organs, where it is usually stored in a special chamber where the eggs pass through and are fertilized as they are laid.  This is all usually just after she molts her exoskeleton.

It will continue to get closer to the pole until the end of the century, when it will be 0.5° away.

frK8VOjFaa	Is the water pure or impure?  <br>  If it's pure, no matter how much much heat energy you put into the system, that energy will be used to convert the liquid to a vapor and it won't be used to raise the temperature of the liquid.  So the temperature of water boiling after 5 minutes will be the same as the temperature of water boiling after 10 hours: 100 deg C and 212 deg F.<br>  If it's impure, the presence of impuritiies will raise the boiling point and, likewise, lower the melting point.  These are known as the boiling point elevation and melting point depression, respectively.  For example, when it snows, roads get salted because the presence of salt (NaCl) will lower the melting point of water so that water will be able to melt at temperatures below freezing (0 deg. C/ 32 deg F).  As such, adding impurities to water will cause the boiling point to be above 100 deg C/212 deg F.  If you want your pasta to cook at a higher temperature, a cool trick is to add salt to your boiling water.  <br>  The short answer is: the temp of pure liquid water (not the vapor) is still and always will be 100 deg C/212 deg F.  However, if impurities are present, the temperature will be somewhere above the boiling point.|`|e5fjD2IFaa	it depends on the temperature at which you are heating the water... a high temperature will cause it to reach to 100 degrees centigrade in 5 mins.|`|ThYN1mFFaa	212 degrees F or 100 degrees C<br>  <br>  Why a thumbs down is beyond any reason.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy (usually in the form of ATP) to move a substance against its concentration gradient.<br>  <br>  An action potential occurs in a neuron (nerve cell) or muscle cell.  All the movement of ions occur due to simple diffusion.  What happens is that there is a stimulus that causes a depolarization.  This depolarization opens the voltage gated sodium channels, and sodium moves into the cell (by diffusion).  The sodium moves along the cell, causing depolarizations in neighboring areas, which in turn depolarizes them and causes their voltage gated sodium channels to open.  This process continues along (in the neuron) until the area of depolarization reaches the axon terminal (or bouton).  Here the electrical signal (electrical because the movement of charged ions caused an electrical field) changes to a chemical one - a neurotransmitter is released and moves (by diffusion) to another cell, and causes a change in it.
AA10093500	You are indeed looking into the past per se, as the light you see from all those stars took time to arrive to your eyes. So you are seeing them as they appeared at the time when  that light left them.<br>  <br>  You are seeing them in the present -- your time, but in the past -- their time.<br>  <br>  Time IS relative. When things occur 'simultaneously' it means relative to a reference time set and agreed on by the observing parties.<br>  <br>  Your time is your time and what is universal is the duration. It may be noon at one place and 3 another and 6 some place else any some given instant, but the duration of say 15 minutes is the same for everyone. It's where on that scale of time that varies.<br>  <br>  It's like height.....a tree is 50 feet tall, and it's understood to mean 50 feet relative to the ground, but it could be measured relative to a lake's surface, the bottom of the lake, or a valley even....anything.

Time is like this too, and when you factor in the effects of high speed motion -- relativity theory (special relativity) then you start messing with the *duration* as well.<br>  <br>  It's all very funky....and if you start looking at faster-than-light signals (tachyons) you start getting bizarre effects, like; receiving signals before they are sent......it's a madhouse I tell you, but fun and the mystery is fun to work with and think about.<br>  <br>  You're engaging in some good brain exercise!|`|bxlYleZkaa	With whose clock are you counting?|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Depends on where you are.

J4cSgIreaa	Capacitors do not behave the same as resistors. Whereas resistors allow a flow of electrons through them directly proportional to the voltage drop, capacitors oppose changes in voltage by drawing or supplying current as they charge or discharge to the new voltage level. The flow of electrons “through” a capacitor is directly proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor. This opposition to voltage change is another form of reactance, but one that is precisely opposite to the kind exhibited by inductors. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to some more info in more scientific detail.<br>  <br>  www.nhn.ou.edu/~fleshman/1215/labs/lab...<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|deff56c7bd6aab37f73ee6ca5ea9decfaa	when the capacitor is connected to an Ac source, it limits or regulates the the current, but does not completely prevent hte flow of charge. it is alternately charged and discharged as the current reverses each half cycle.A capacitor in an AC circuit exhibits a kind of resistance called capacitive reactance, measured in ohms.

FAwEkYyZaa	The artificial kidney is called a dialysis machine. It a machine that takes your blood in your vein then through a series of tubes which undergoes filtration, by the use of reverse osmosis. The reverse osmosis takes the by product of your blood like nitrogen in your blood, away from your body by having a disimilar solution that sucks the waste by product of your body through a thin membrane.Blood that is now cleaned is then returned to the body, This process can take hours, because you natural kidneys does that all through out the day.|`|8xBS8w4Baa	an artificial kidney machine that is dialysis machine contains dialysis fluid . when blood is passed through this fluid ,the waste product like urea , creatinine etc diffuses in the dialysis fluid . in this way it works . <br>  NOTE : the dialysis fluid should contain the same concentration of glucose as in the blood. Other wise glucose in the blood will also diffuse through the semi permeable membrane into the dialysis fluid.

2lQ8DJAcaa	What will happen to the Earth when there is no Sun? <br>  The short answer is that BEFORE the Sun actually 'dies', the Sun will evolve into what is called a red giant star. Its outer edge will be way out here near the Earth's orbit so that the Earth itself will be Bar-B-Qued. This will happen in about 6 billion years, but our investigations of stars like the Sun show that in about 500 million to 1 billion years from now, the Sun will have grown in its power output so that the temperature of the Earth's surface will be 50 - 100 degrees higher than it is today. The oceans will evaporate into the sky which will cause the earth to heat up just like Venus is today with surface temperatures above 500 degrees F . So, long before the Sun dies, life on this Earth will come to an end. It took multi-celled life about 600 million years to get to were we are today. This means that we are half way finished with the age of life on this planet. 500 million years seems like a long time, but if we take too many wrong turns in creating a future for our species, even 500 million years from now, we will be extinct a long time before that! Natural catastrophies, asteroid impacts and other things can easily cause a devastating impact on humans from which we could not easily recover space travel technology.|`|uOqk7PzGaa	we will be long gone by then.<br>  <br>  The sun will extinguish its Hydrogen fuel and will start using Helium as a supply, this will make the sun turn red. It will start growing to the point that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Once Helium is gone then the sun will temporarily burn other heavier elements and will start loosing mass. The sun will shrink to the size of a planet and will become a white dwarf slowly cooling to space as a cold dead star.<br>  <br>  Edit: Not sure what to tell you, that is exactly what is going to happen to the sun and the planets around it. Humans will be long long gone before the sun even becomes a red giant: either humans will be extinct or or have left the planet for other solar system like ours. That is what WILL happen regardless of anything humans do.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	The current speculation is that the sun will not completely go out.  Rather,  in about 5 billion years it will expand into a cooler burning Red Giant.  The Red Giant that will expand roughly 250 times it's current radius consuming the three inner planets.  As Paul Harvey used to say that's U.S. us!<br>  <br>  So the dynamic in the solar system will change leaving Mars as the closest planet to the Sun. The earth will end (life actually as we know it will end about 1 billion years before the Red Giant phase).  Whatever atmosphere is left on Mars will be completely blown away.  Jupiter will be in the position of where earth is now (remember the asteroid belt exists at the logical point were a planet should exist). <br>  <br>  Because of the increased proximity to the sun the dynamics of all the planets and moons will change.  IMHO, some of Jupiter's moons might be the best habitable place for mankind.  Especially Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  Some of the dwarf planets like Ceres and Vesta might also be candidates.  We'd better get to be good a Terra Forming or life is going to be rough.  <br>  <br>  The orbital dynamics of the outer planets will probably not change very much although this is pure speculation and it's difficult to say how they will change.  The outer planets will probably not warm considerable because a Red Giant is considerably cooler that a G2 class star like our sun.<br>  <br>  Eventually the sun will blow off the red giant shell becoming a planetary nebula and collapse into a white dwarf. Then, having exhausted all of it's fuel, burn out leaving our solar system a very cold place to be.  <br>  <br>  By that time we better have found a new place to live.|`|KHSOVxViaa	If we're lucky, and get our act together a bit more, we'll have spread out and colonised quite a few exoplanets by then.  Local isolation will mean each colony's humans will evolve differently from each other, as well as any life we bring with us, so there will no longer be humans as we know them.<br>  <br>  Instead there could be a substantial number of human-descended species, though quite possibly in a number of cases it will be our descendants who become extinct and the other forms of life that become predominant on that planet.<br>  <br>  Towards the end of the Sun's life it will run out of hydrogen.  It will fuse helium to carbon, then carbon to other materials right up to iron.  The higher thermal energy from these reactions will cause it to expand in size and become a red giant.<br>  <br>  As for our planets - Earth will be frazzled to a crisp.  If the Sun expands beyond its orbit, as it might, the orbit will decay and it will fall into the heart of the Sun, disintegrating the same way as Mercury and Venus beforehand.  An increased solar wind will increase the radius of the outer planets' orbits.  Mars will likely lose what's left of its atmosphere and any volatile substances in the crust.  The outer planets may have increased evaporation, but its unlikely they'll just boil away.  By the time the Sun shrinks to be a dwarf, some remnant, possibly substantial, of the gas giants will remain.<br>  <br>  The Sun will splutter a bit going through the last of its more energetic fusions, throwing off much of its outer layers to form a planetary nebula. The core will collapse under its own gravity to become a hot, dense, rapidly spinning remnant, slowly cooling to become a white dwarf.<br>  <br>  The Oort cloud and volatile outer solar system bodies will be pushed outwards by this expanding planetary nebula.<br>  <br>  After a few million years, what's left of the solar system will look quite pretty from telescopes on nearby worlds!|`|854xeaRvaa	the universe will be swallowed in one of the holes to emerge in another realm , another life.. the black holes are gates to another sphere ... no this is my imagination|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Most stars, when they use up their fuel grow into huge red giants (bigger than our solar system), which will destroy whatever is left of this solar system. It will then condense down on itself, forming a brown or white dwarf, with mass so intense the entire star will only be about the size of Earth, but the mass so heavy a single teaspoon would weigh 60,000 tons--if it could be measured in such a way. After this the pressure will increase until the gravitational force will punch a hole in space/time, and suck in the remnants of the system. <br>  But this whole scenario won't matter to humans, because we will either be extinct or evolved into something that would have left this solar system eons before.<br>  And finally: Did you know that it was believed (centuries ago) that the sun's fuel (core) was coal, and that it was estimated that it would all burn up in 6,000 years (kind of along the lines of the Bibical 7,000 years of existence)?

AA10008098	Brain activity likely involves the firing of synapses, the consumption of oxygen and the use of sugars.  Ordinarily this should not cause identifiable sensations.  However, pain and pleasure may release different psycho-chemicals and their concentrations may be detectable as mood, etc.  Loss of a close relative (or lover?) may release chemicals that cause perceptible pain.  Headaches may be involved with the constriction of capillaries, etc.  The brain is very complicated but it may be difficult to relate cause and effect to routine events (music, language, etc.).

Cppi6kRFaa	A cheaper method then the humidifier is to just boil water on the cook top. The evaporating water will put moisture in the air and help control static electricity.|`|AA11707529	First, if you wear slippers, have carpeting in your house, and shuffle when you walk, that will create static, so don't touch anything metal when dressed this way: wear shoes when ever you can. <br>  <br>  Then there's if you have a lot of metal objects in your home. Do not touch them directly. First, grab hold of something wooden -- it will ground you out, and you shouldn't get a shock. <br>  <br>  Also, humidify your home. The air is overly dry in the winter.<br>  <br>  And THE  worst, is static you create in your car. If you pivot on your butt before getting out, you will receive one hell of a shock when you get out. The clothes you wear rub against the cloth seat, you touch the metal door rise getting out, and, OWW!! The best thing to do is ground yourself out first, by touching the rubber part of the window, or PUSHING the door open [with a foot or object], BEFORE getting out. With the door open, reach around a hand, and touch the side with your palm before getting out. This will help keep you from getting a shock when climbing out. My husband ignores this advice, and gets shocked EVERY TIME.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you are on your cell as you pull into a gas station, hang up, before exiting the car. I must warn you -- even just keeping it on will put you at great risk, even if it may not seem so. ANY metal is a great source for a shock. AND, once you exit the vehicle, do not reach back in or climb back inside... not only can this give you a shock, it could create a big enough one to start a gas pump fire. If you ever get a fire, DO NOT remove the fuel pump hose from your tank. That provides a fuel source for the fire, and there will be a HUGE explosion.... just run and tell the clerk to turn the pump off. <br>  <br>  And the last thing I can think of is clothes: knit material like sweaters and blankets are full of static once you put them on or use them, in the winter.|`|3a7880f184966840b001503e5b53b7b0aa	There are a number of things aggravate this problem each with its own fix.<br>  <br>  Humidity - The problem is worse in hot dry or cold dry weather.

CCeRdaoLaa	It's true that blood flows against the water current (called counter-current flow).  This kind of flow actually makes O2 absorption *more* efficient because of the way hemoglobin works. Hemoglobin cam bind 4 O2 molecules at one time, but each one is a little harder to bind than the last.  By flowing against the water flow, fresh blood enters in at the back of the gills, where O2 concentration is lowest, but is offset by the fact that the first O2 is really easy to bind.  By the time the blood reaches the front of the gills, it has already bound 3 O2 molecules, but here the O2 concentration is highest, making it easier for the hemoglobin to bind that 4th O2.<br>  <br>  It's not necessarily evidence for a designer, though.  It simply allows much more efficient O2 absorption, and so could be selected for by evolution.<br>  <br>  The problem with ID is that it is fundamentally unfalsifiable.  To any conceivable argument, one could simply argue "the designers made it that way."  If there are flaws in the system, then it is possible that they were simply designed that way, or as you said, turn out not to be flaws at all.  This, combined with the fact that ID has no positive evidence (it is only supported by the gaps in our knowledge), means that ID isn't science.|`|uOqk7PzGaa	If I say that I agree, would I get best answer?

Gnfc4wRlaa	Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigerants, solvents, foam blowing agents, and in other smaller applications. Other chlorine-containing compounds include methyl chloroform, a solvent, and carbon tetrachloride, an industrial chemical. Halons, extremely effective fire extinguishing agents, and methyl bromide, an effective produce and soil fumigant, contain bromine. All of these compounds have atmospheric lifetimes long enough to allow them to be transported by winds into the stratosphere. Because they release chlorine or bromine when they break down, they damage the protective ozone layer. The discussion of the ozone depletion process below focuses on CFCs, but the basic concepts apply to all of the ozone-depleting substances (ODS).<br>  <br>  The CFCs are so stable that only exposure to strong UV radiation breaks them down. When that happens, the CFC molecule releases atomic chlorine. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules. The net effect is to destroy ozone faster than it is naturally created.<br>  <br>  Large fires and certain types of marine life produce one stable form of chlorine that does reach the stratosphere. However, numerous experiments have shown that CFCs and other widely-used chemicals produce roughly 84% of the chlorine in the stratosphere, while natural sources contribute only 16%.<br>  <br>  Large volcanic eruptions can have an indirect effect on ozone levels. Although Mt. Pinatubo's 1991 eruption did not increase stratospheric chlorine concentrations, it did produce large amounts of tiny particles called aerosols (different from consumer products also known as aerosols). These aerosols increase chlorine's effectiveness at destroying ozone. The aerosols only increased depletion because of the presence of CFC - based chlorine. In effect, the aerosols increased the efficiency of the CFC siphon, lowering ozone levels even more than would have otherwise occurred. Unlike long-term ozone depletion, however, this effect is short-lived. The aerosols from Mt. Pinatubo have disappeared, but satellite, ground-based, and balloon data still show ozone depletion occurring closer to the historic trend.<br>  <br>  One example of ozone depletion is the annual ozone "hole" over Antarcticathat has occurred during the Antarctic Spring since the early 1980s. Rather than being a literal hole through the layer, the ozone hole is a large area of the stratosphere with extremely low amounts of ozone. Ozone levels fall by over 60% during the worst years.<br>  <br>  In addition, research has shown that ozone depletion occurs over the latitudes that include North America, Europe, Asia, and much of Africa, Australia, and South America. Over the U.S., ozone levels have fallen 5-10%, depending on the season. Thus, ozone depletion is a global issue and not just a problem at the South Pole.<br>  <br>  Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes nonmelanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to cataracts. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun. However, ozone depletion will increase the amount of UVB, which will then increase the risk of health effects.<br>  <br>  Measurements carried out in the Antarctic have shown that at certain times, more than 95% of the ozone concentrations found at altitudes of between 15 and 20 km and more than 50% of total ozone are destroyed, with reductions being most pronounced during winter and in early spring. Natural phenomena, such as sun-spots and stratospheric winds, also decrease stratospheric ozone levels, but typically not by more than 1-2%.|`|j4Q2Eb57aa	The wright answer is Ozone layer is not get re-charged as it depeleting rate due to pollutants and mass oxygen consumtion by the human socity. , more over we are wrongly conceived the notion about the Ozone layer depletion?

e5fjD2IFaa	A convex polygon is defined as a polygon with all its interior angles less than 180°. This means that all the vertices of the polygon will point outwards, away from the interior of the shape. Think of it as a 'bulging' polygon. Note that a triangle (3-gon) is always convex.<br>  A convex polygon is the opposite of a concave polygon.

D2nu1fPEaa	Amotosalen, methylene blue and riboflavin all inactivate pathogens by blocking replication of the nucleic acid genome of viruses, bacteria or parasites that may be present in donated blood.  If a pathogen can't replicate, it can't infect the transfusion recipient.<br>  <br>  The inactivation process doesn't compromise the function of the blood components because platelets and red blood cells are terminally differentiated cells (they don't replicate and don't have nuclear DNA) and plasma is just a liquid, not a cellular product.  So nucleic acid-based inactivation processes are targeting something which is critical to the infectivity of pathogens, but not to the function of the blood component itself.<br>  <br>  The donor's white blood cells may also be present in the donated blood.  These cells do contain nuclei, and may be inactivated by the pathogen inactivation treatment (varies by method).  However, the donor's white cells can cause complications to the recipient (transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, acute transfusion reactions), so it's actually desirable to inactivate white cells.<br>  <br>  A solvent-detergent pathogen inactivation method is also available for plasma.

The usual method of trying to solve these problems is assuming a solution of the form,<br>  y=e^{ax}<br>  <br>  Assuming this solution, we can determine, <br>  dy/dx=a*y<br>  d^y/dx^2=(a^2)*y<br>  <br>  Now, we can plug those results into your original equation to obtain,<br>  (a^2)*y + 3*a*y+2*y=0<br>  <br>  We can divide through by y and determine that,<br>  a^2+3a+2=0<br>  <br>  From this, we can solve for a and we find that a={-1,-2}.  Therefore, we know that there are two solutions to the equation, both <br>  y=e^{-x} and y=e^{-2x}<br>  <br>  Since the original differential equation is linear, we can create a linear combination of the two solutions to form a general solution to the homogeneous equation,<br>  <br>  y=A*e^{-x} + B*e^{-2x}<br>  <br>  where A and B are unknown constants.  I will let you finish the problem from here - basically you just use your intial conditions to obtain two equations relating A and B, from which you can solve for A and B.

That means that transformers with adjustable taps are presumed to be at the flat, or neutral position prior to the start of the simulation. Then, the simulation is allowed to choose taps that achieve certain criteria such as maintaining voltage at some point within a specified band.<br>  <br>  It is also customary to initiate a load flow simulation with all bus voltages presumed to be at 1.0 perunit.  That is the same thing as a 'flat profile' of voltage across the system.  The alternative is to choose some other starting point, but for off line applications, that's usually considered unnecessary work.  It may be helpful in accelerating a solution, but normally in off-line studies, the computation time is not especially important   <br>  <br>  On the other hand, in an on-line application, starting the simulation with voltages closer to the final value will shorten the time required to get to those solutions.  On-line state estimators can be used to infer starting voltages.

bxxmaycraa	It sure as heck can!  But that doesn't necessarily mean it will.  <br>  <br>  The key will be to plan your program so that you will always be a half-step ahead, all the time, so that you will always have a pretty good idea of what each course contains, always have a pretty good command of the prerequisites, and always have a little time available for emergencies.<br>  <br>  First, you need to identify the course work for the entire program.<br>  <br>  Second, have a general plan for getting through the entire program.<br>  <br>  Third, understand where you are in terms of actual understanding of these courses.  Adjust your plan so that by the time you reach each course in real-time, you will be pretty sure you have mastered the prerequisites.<br>  <br>  Fourth, to improve your future gpa, schedule time to pre-study all the more difficult courses.  By that, I mean use free and unofficial on-line courses that are available for just about everything you will need.  Have a good browse entirely through the tough courses, identify and do overviews of the most difficult sections from your pov.  This will greatly ease the strain when you actually take the courses, as well as give you better test results.<br>  <br>  Maybe most important, involved your family in your struggle from the beginning.  When your family is on your side, anything is possible.<br>  <br>  I was a bit younger than you when I took on a similar road.  For me to make it, I had to work until Ihad the money to do the first two years without working on a job.  But I didn't have the on-line tools available today, nor did I have any hope of student loans other than the GI Bill which was a big part of my resources.  Otherwise, I did pretty much as I suggest to you, picking up a family on the way.<br>  <br>  If after you think it all through you have serious doubts, don't start.  Life is full of happy people who get along fine without being Engineers, they just make sure they can provide a useful service of some kind to some employer.  <br>  <br>  If you can work out a long-term plan,  keep positive, love your family, no worries, and take it one day at a time.|`|9535d40205e67996eef08db4d32873a1aa	I went the nights route and received a BS in Civil Engineering.

AA11513203	That's a little tricky to answer.<br>  <br>  Certainly we have no evidence whatsoever that there is any "essence" of life that is missing from atoms ... i.e. that a certain configuration of atoms, moving in a certain way, does not constitute "life".<br>  <br>  But the problem is that "life" is not just a configuration of atoms, but a *process* in action.<br>  <br>  As a warm up exercise, ask yourself if it possible to put the right elements (hydrogen and oxygen) together to not only create a cup of water ... but a cup of *boiling* water.   You would imagine not just bringing together all of those H and O atoms into H2O molecules, but *then* applying energy to start it boiling.   But imagine having to start the water boiling without an energy source ... i.e. you need to get all the H2O molecules *moving* and transforming from liquid to gas (steam) with enough motion that you have created a cup of water in the act of boiling.  That is more like the task you are imagining for creating life by just collecting the correct atoms together.<br>  <br>  Second example, a bit more to the point.   Imagine reconstructing your brain ... atom-for-atom, molecule-for-molecule, nerve-cell-for-nerve-cell into an exact atom-for-atom replica of your brain.   That still would not bring it to life.  That still would not recreate your thoughts and memories ... because your thoughts and memories are a particular configuration of *firing* nerve cells.   So how would you get that started?<br>  <br>  And so that is the problem with jump-starting life.    Life is not just a collection of atoms ... but it is a chemical *reaction* in the act of occurring.   It requires not just the right combination of chemicals ... but the right application of energy, at the right time, with the right amount, the right availability for additional energy and elements, etc.  It is a very difficult problem.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	What you describe is insufficient.

It is fairly easy to demonstrate with sheer numbers of people that almost all have the five fingers on a hand. Humanness causes five fingers on a hand (among other characteristics). But, the reverse is not true. Five fingers is shared with apes and monkeys. It can be shown that not all creatures with five fingers are human. So rigor must be maintained.

Cl2is5hYaa	I'd say it depends on why their on the verge of extinction.  If it's because of natural causes, then no, as that's what Survival of the Fittest is all about (or at least half of it anyway).  If a species can't survive on it's own in the wild, tough luck.  If it's because of a direct impact of man (say a nearby city as grown to a size where the natural habitat is gone, and a species only lived there) then yes.  That said, global warming is not one of those cases, as it is a natural occurring event (only accelerated by man, not caused), so if the polar bears can't adapt, as beautiful as they are........ that's the way things are.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	all animals are part of the food chain in some way or another.  an animal goes exticnt, the food chain gets thrown out of wack, and that starts affecting everyone.
TL1Jkqunaa	No, there is no one site for all  types of sperm banks.  But many zoos do have sperm banks for endangered species and help to supply them to other zoos.

However, in terms of sperm, I doubt there is.  It's extremely hard to keep sperm for a long time and with the case of extinct animals, it would serve little purpose as an egg would be needed to reproduce.  Endangered animals, especially the ones with longer gestation periods and less offspring would most likely have sperm kept to fertilize females that may be non responsive to males.|`|rJ3Pb4Qbaa	Not really. I mean in captivity, they have used artificial insemination to help their animals reproduce. Instead of worrying about two animals getting along and mating, they take the sperm from the male and insert it directly into the female. However, this can be expensive, and there isn't any guarantee that it will work.

Some division answers go on and on, and you would have to round them off after a decided upon number of places. <br>  Next, put your decimal point after the numerator (upper figure) and then add as many zeros as you want decimal places in the answer.<br>  Then do you dividing the way you should have learned in grade school. <br>  <br>  Example: 9 / 4. want 5 place answer.  So, 9.00000 divided by 4.  4 goes into 9 twice (2) with 1 left over. 4 goes into 10 twice (2) with 2 left over. 4 goes into 20 five times (5) with nothing left over.

When you're doing projectile motion, divide the projectile's velocity into two parts- the one in the vertical direction and the one in the horizontal direction. The cannon is shooting its cannonball with a muzzle velocity of 120 m/s, but some of that (120*sin(36.9) m/s, to be precise) is in the vertical direction. You're concerned with the 120*cos(36.9) = 83.68 m/s in the horizontal direction, which, assuming no air resistance, will not change. This is because the only force acting on the cannonball, gravity, is in the vertical direction. Hence, divide 672 m by 83.68 m/s to get 8.03 seconds. <br>  <br>  Make sure to check that it doesn't hit the ground before those 8.03 seconds are up, these can often be trick questions!

l0Ojx5DCaa	1) A and B are not mutually exclusive. If there are two heads, one tail, both are true. Mutually exclusive means that both cannot simultaneously happen.<br>  <br>  2) A and C are mutually exclusive. A says there are exactly two heads, C says there are exactly three heads or exactly zero heads. These two conditions contradict each other. Too specific.<br>  <br>  3) A and B are not independent. If A is true, B is guaranteed to be true. Independence means that knowing that one is true tells you nothing about the truth or probability of occurence of the other.<br>  <br>  4) B and C are independent. If C is true, it gives you no information as to whether B is true. If B is true, it gives you no information as to whether C is true. They have no bearing on each other.<br>  <br>  More explicitly on #4, the probability of B being true is 4/8. The probability of C being true is 2/8. If B is true, then the probability of C is now 1/4 instead of 2/8. If C is true, the probability of B being true is now 1/2 instead of 4/8. However, you'll notice that these probabilities are the same. So, B and C don't effect the probability of the other being true.|`|cjJ9yVrVaa	.dfk
Z2eeToKzaa	PATIENCE and understanding. For some reason I was always the most frightened of my math teachers (probably because I was frightened of math itself). The best teachers I had were ones which would take the extra bit of time, to explain it that one more time, til the light bulb clicked on. I've been in the arts my whole adult life, but because of a few patient and understanding teachers - who sought to listen to me rather than intimidate me - I managed to rake up a few math awards, believe it or not. Good luck!|`|i8ySLyjLaa	-some students need things explained in layman's terms<br>  -patience<br>  -doing something fun every once in a while (for example, one of my teachers sung class one day, talked like forrest gump another, etc.)<br>  -not giving lots of homework, but enough to ensure that people understand the subjects completely|`|YUAegpPoaa	Patience and the ability to explain things many different ways.<br>  <br>  Knowledge of mathematics is a definite plus. :)|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	The best math professor I ever had was the professor I had for College level Trig. She had a great sense of humor. She was very animated in class. She used a lot of visual aides. She used to say that by the end of class, we would think she is dancing in front of class. When describing things like, say the unit circle, she would take a yard stick in both hands point to 3 o'clock and take the other one and point to 9 o'clock. Thus, the dancing. She just had a light, friendly personality and just loved mathematics. You could see it in her face. She was very enthusiastic. If someone had a question,  she would not give the answer straight away, she talked people through it and had them come to the answer. She was tough, but fair. I have continued much higher in mathematics than trig. But, she is the professor that sticks out in my mind as the best. Have patience with students. Not everyone gets it the first time.<br>  Be animated, enthusiastic, and passionate about math and let your students see it. Be entertaining. Be tough but fair. Have a sense of humor. Be visual in your presentations. Most people remember things like yardsticks pointing in opposite directions to represent going from 0 to π. Please do not speak in a dull, mono tone voice. Nothing puts people to sleep faster.<br>  I am sure you are a good math prof. I think if you incorporate some of these things, you could be a great math prof. I am sure you are on the right road. It is the habit of great people to stop, evaluate, get suggestions, and open themselves up to self criticism on how to improve themselves that make them better. <br>  Good luck. I hope this helps.|`|j6dAbXCAaa	Here's an intersting story for my background. I started in Math/Computer Science. My last semester, I changed to Math Education, because I thought I would be a good teacher and I got satisfaction in helping others with math.<br>  <br>  I taught for one year in a very small southern Nebraska school. I taught 7th - 11th grade math. Had 5 lesson plans every day. Wanted to coach and they wouldn't let me. Had no social life as a single 24 year old. Unfortunately, that was it for my teaching career, just 1 year.<br>  <br>  Recently I did teach a college algebra class for a community college. For all the hours I put in for preparing, making tests, grading, etc, I made probably $9/hour. Yikes.<br>  <br>  ANYWAY, lol, a good teacher to me must bring the level of the content down to the students' level. Even if you are at the college level, it would depend on the content of the class. College Algebra or even Calculus 1 means you would need to bring the content down to the students for the most part. A Calc 3 or Discrete Math etc means nearly all the students are good at math.<br>  <br>  In general, if you can teach facing the students, rather than with your back to the students, this makes the teacher effective.<br>  <br>  Again, at a college level, asking questions of the students might not be as important or as possible, but I'd suggest asking questions as much as possible.<br>  <br>  You have my utmost admiration for wanting to continue to improve even at the college level. Bigtime kudos to you! We need more teachers at all levels like you!|`|TqtzzsHjaa	Well, it all depends on what level you are teaching at. If you are teaching kids e.g 12 - 16 years olds, they probably act dim-wittedly (not all kids mind) so you'd have to be more strict, and give them detention for not doing their homework on time, or whatever. otherwise they'll never learn.<br>  <br>  But if the student is older, then being nice, and acting generally as speaking to another adult. (unless the student acts as a child). Also bringing humour into the mix isnt a bad idea. Explaining thouroughly the questions, and how to get answers. <br>  <br>  Remember all students will have different capabilities, so try setting, some easy and some hard maths questions.<br>  <br>  Also patience.|`|4pw41geQaa	Hi I'm a student right now.

In this case, he empathized more with students who didn't get it. On the other hand, when he taught courses related to his research area, he tended to get excited (rightfully so) and go a bit faster because it was the material that came easy to him.  Because of this, he told us if he started to do that (I took a class related to his area) to make sure we slowed him down if we weren't getting it.  <br>  <br>  The fact that he recognized this, in my opinion, made him an excellent teacher!<br>  <br>  So, that is one thing to consider in your quest to become and even better teacher.|`|FC4VXL4saa	Making things more interesting for the students, like teaching maths from different perspectives, and in ways that will actually interest and excite the students, which is a difficult thing for a teacher to do but it CAN be achieved!<br>  <br>  * Make the students laugh.<br>  * Make sure they have respect for you, because after that, you can teach them in much more interesting ways much easier.<br>  * Do different things with them as well to teach them the maths, like games, class debates, and things that involve colour and pictures, because that may sound really childish, but EVERYONE, not just children, learn better when there are pictures and colours involved that help them to remember things. That goes for everyone! <br>  * Be something special that leaves a spark in their memories - when they think back to their maths tutor, they will have good, special memories.<br>  <br>  There are also a lot of teaching websites and books that you should  check out, that give you ideas and spark your imagination.<br>  No matter how long someone has been teaching for, there is ALWAYS still something else to learn.|`|bszyOuIqaa	I am a college student who hates math.

UFteXlqwaa	From ancient time, man used the northern star to find a latitude. The Babylonians divided the circle in 360 degrees and by holding a piece of wood at arm's length, measuring the elevation of the northern star above the horizon, those became our latitudes because at say, latitude 40, the northern star is seen at roughly 40 degrees above the horizon.<br>  <br>  The longitude was an entirely different matter and seafarers didn't manage to measure it accurately before John Harrison, at the end of the 18th century invented the marine chronograph.<br>  <br>  Because measuring the longitude is measuring a time angle in relation to an arbitrary place of reference: Greenwich in England, that is called the prime meridian.<br>  <br>  But, because the Babylonians had divided the circle in 360 degrees, that measuring unit was also used for the longitude.

They require students to remember the numerical value of a mole (Avagadro's number), which is 6.02E23, which is the number chemists call a "mole". Moles are very important in chemistry, but the actual value of this number is not. Chemists use moles to express weight. For example, this many hydrogen atoms weighs 1 gram. This number is found in the periodic table and is called an atomic weight.<br>  <br>  Oxygen weighs 16 grams per mole. Now, what is true of atoms is also true of molecules. A mole of water molecules (H2O) weighs 1 + 1 + 16 = 18 grams/mole. This is the molecular weight of water. Having calculated this, it is easy to express a given weight as a certain number of moles. 45 grams is 45 g / (18 g/mole) = 2.5 moles of water molecules. I leave it to you to calculate the number of individual atoms. Nothing personal, but as a working chemist it is below my dignity!<br>  <br>  Hydrogen gas is calculated exactly the same way, but with a trick. Hydrogen gas is a molecule, H2. The molecular weight will be 2 grams, but the number of individual atoms is twice the number of moles of molecules.

abVU9tTCaa	The answer to your first question is: AB = 2R sin (74.63709553°)<br>  <br>  To get this we need 2 equations: the equation for the area of a segment of a sector of a circle and the equation for the chord that bounds that segment. <br>  <br>  Let C be the chord (i.e., distance bet. A & B),  R  = radii of the circles, D be the central angle (angle subtended by the chord-also equal for both circles) and W be the area of one segment . We have:<br>  <br>  C = 2R sin (D/2) >> as you can see we only need to express D in terms of R, and<br>  <br>  W = ? (R2 D  - R2 sin D) >> D in radians.<br>  <br>  Since the 2 circles with equal radii overlap, the area of their overlap is just twice the area of one segment, also as your problem stated, it should be equal to the sum of area of the crescents formed so:<br>  <br>  R2 D  - R2 sin D = 2* [ pi R2 - (R2 D  - R2 sin D) ] >> because the area of the crescents are equal.<br>  <br>  Rearranging these terms and simplifying (divide everything by R2), we will have:<br>  <br>  3 sin D = 3D – 2 pi   >> there is no close form solution for these equation (and I don’t think Taylor’s approx. for sine will work here) so let us use Newton’s method; first arrange the eq:<br>  <br>  3 sin D – 3D + 2 pi = 0 >> just find the zero of this equation by a series of approximation:<br>  <br>  X – [ (3 sin D – 3D + 2 pi ) / (3 cos D – 3) ] >> newton’s method<br>  <br>  I use LISP here and it took about 15 iterations, starting with an initial guess of 1 radian and accuracy of 0.000001<br>  <br>  So you will get 2.605326 radians, substitute this to the eq. of C and you’ll get the answer.<br>  <br>  I am not ambitious so I won’t solve the second problem.

As you can see, it’s too long =]|`|qozdiWpIaa	As the circles intersect at points A & B and as both circles are of radii r each, we assume their centers at C and D. AC and AD are extended to other part of circles to cut at E and F such that AE = AD = the diameter which is 2r in length. The right angled triangles ABE and ABF with angle at B = 90 degrees either side. CD bisect AE and AF and it is obvious to see that AB and CD bisect each other as rt. angled triangles ABE and ABF are equivalent because squares of EB and FB are equal to square of diameter minus square of AB. The angle made by  AB at A with respect both diameters at A for both circles are equal. If that angle made by diameters of both circles are each equal to say "X", in each the above  rt. angled triangles:<br>   Square of AB = 4 times square of radius r multiplied by square of CosX   ..... (1)<br>  From triangles AOC and AOD obtained by bisection of AB and CD at O, we get SinX = CD/2r. <br>  Square of CosX = 1 - Square of SinX = 1 - Square of (CD/2r)  = square of (2r - CD)/4 times square of radius r .... (2)<br>  From (1) and (2)  we get  that  AB = 2r - CD<br>  or the length AB = twice the radius of circle minus distance bet\ween their centers..<br>  <br>  According to ambitious case it is <br>  AB = sum of radii of circles minus distance between their centers.

O7rMKLEMaa	Yes; it is possible, but not practical. The bottom of an SE at 50 north would be tilted toward the equator---perhaps 20 above the horizon. The angle between the SE and equatorial plane would gradually decrease. The top would be nearly parallel to the equatorial plane, and it would be perhaps 2000 km north of the equatorial plane. (All those numbers are wild guesses.) <br>  <br>  A payload being dropped off at the middle would be in a slightly elliptical orbit. The opposite side of that orbit would be as far south of the equator as the middle of the SE is north of the equator. Relative to the middle of the SE, the released payload would go south; about a day later, it would retrurn close to the SE. <br>  <br>  For an SE at the equator, the middle (meaning the point of maximum tension and maximum thickness) must be 35,786 km above sea level; that is 42,164 km from Earth's axis. For an SE anchored at 50° north, the middle would still be 42,164 km from Earth's axis. The anchor point would be 6396 km * (1 - cos(50°)) = 2,285 km closer to Earth's axis; so the middle would have to be 2,285 km farther from the anchor (actually more like 3,000 km because it's a curved path). <br>  <br>  That additional bottom portion would have to be thick enough to life a payload as well as its own weight, and the rest of the SE would have to be thickened enough to support the additional weigh of the bottom section plus supporting the increase in its own weight. <br>  <br>  There's no point trying to calculate how much thicker the SE would have to be because we are still theoretically a decade away from having a material strong enough to anchor an SE at the equator.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	no. it must be over the equator.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Possibly, but it would be very problematic. Remember, the path of the counterweight is not an orbital path unless its plane passes through the Earth's center of mass. A space elevator sticking either straight out parallel to the plane of the equator OR straight out from the center of the Earth, from a point that wasn't on the equator, would not be orbiting and its position would be extremely unstable. If you placed the counterweight above the equator and just had the cable angled such that it anchored north of the equator, that wouldn't work either, because the centrifugal force would cause the elevator to swing northwards, whereupon again it would no longer be orbiting; trying to have the counterweight swing up and down as the Earth turned would probably run into the same kind of problem. I don't think it's feasible any way you try to do it.<br>  <br>  That said, what WOULD be perfectly feasible is if you wanted to have the counterweight placed above the equator and just anchor it using two cables, one north of the equator and one south of the equator. That may actually be your best bet for political reasons, for example you might be able to have one cable come down around Japan and the other around Australia, rather than having to deal with the political repercussions of trying to place a single cable in some equatorial country.<br>  <br>  >I'm wondering if it would be possible for a space elevator to be created north of the equator where the centrifugal force of the earth is less like in Canada.<br>  <br>  The fact that there is less centrifugal force at higher latitudes is irrelevant, because for one thing the difference of a couple thousand kilometers isn't very large compared to the 30000 kilometers or so that are required for geostationary orbit, and for another thing the space elevator still has to be high enough that the counterweight is above geostationary orbit and so the centrifugal force at its ground location would have rather little effect; in fact, you would just be making it harder for yourself because the cable would be longer and the payloads would take longer to lift up to the altitude of the counterweight.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Think about it.<br>  A 'Space Elevator' requires a geostationary satelite directly <br>  over the base for its upper terminus doesn't it?<br>  How do you get one of those anywhere but at the equator?

mC838ZbLaa	PERIODIC LAW, in chemistry, law stating that many of the physical and chemical properties of the elements tend to recur in a systematic manner with increasing atomic number. Progressing from the lightest to the heaviest atoms, certain properties of the elements approximate those of precursors at regular intervals of 2, 8, 18, and 32. For example, the 2d element (helium) is similar in its chemical behavior to the 10th (neon), as well as to the 18th (argon), the 36th (krypton), the 54th (xenon), and the 86th (radon). The chemical family called the halogens, composed of elements 9 (fluorine), 17 (chlorine), 35 (bromine), 53 (iodine), and 85 (astatine), is an extremely reactive family.

DRVSCxKpaa	Cast iron is basically an alloy of iron and carbon; with a little silicon. In the commonest form, grey cast iron, the carbon is present as graphite, which give it its grey colour.<br>  Cast iron is tough but brittle; and is used in making heavy objects such as engine blocks and pump casings.  <br>  If it cools very rapidly, the carbon can combine to form ferrite; iron carbide.  This is known as white cast iron, and is very hard.<br>  Cast iron can be inoculated with special metals such as cerium, which causes the graphite to form nodules; or spheroidal graphite ('SG') iron.  Less brittle and more malleable.  Or the cast iron can be heat treated to make it malleable.<br>  <br>  The advantage of cast iron is that it has a lower melting point that pure iron or steel, and so can be cast using smaller furnaces.<br>  <br>  The Wikipedia reference is quite good for general information|`|AA10133800	Cast iron refers mostly to grey cast iron, has 2.7 to 3% carbon, 1.8%% silicon and 0.5 tp 0.75% manganese and 95% iron.

z7BiMSWmaa	After passing through a spiracle, air enters a longitudinal tracheal trunk, eventually diffusing throughout a complex, branching network of tracheal tubes that subdivides into smaller and smaller diameters and reaches every part of the body.   At the end of each tracheal branch, a special cell (the tracheole) provides a thin, moist interface for the exchange of gasses between atmospheric air and a living cell.   Oxygen in the tracheal tube first dissolves in the liquid of the tracheole and then diffuses into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell.   At the same time, carbon dioxide, produced as a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the cell and, eventually, out of the body through the tracheal system.

16vMIGPiaa	There may be scientists who, for reasons of faith, accept the Creation story.  However there isn't such a thing as a "Creation Scientist".<br>  <br>  There aren't any "main problems" with the theory of evolution.  The theory itself has evolved and improved as time has gone along.  It is a very workable model of how things happen.  It checks out against what is measurable, and that is the ultimate test of a theory's validity.<br>  <br>  The points a-d look to have been copied from somewhere, and yes they are the 'pedestrian' explanation of part of the theory.  The other significant point that's not mentioned is: unpredicted random mutations that are then passed on or eliminated by the natural selection process.  Mutations that improve surviveability make a particular species more robust.  Genetic weaknesses tend to drive a line to extinction.<br>  Another factor is external influences like massive climate change driven by, say, a huge meteor strike.  Organisms that were able to adapt to the much colder environment lived.  Those that couldn't died.<br>  <br>  In the end, the common thread that binds all life on this little planet together is DNA.  Everything we consider 'alive' has it.  And human DNA is massively similar to what's found even in something as simple as bacteria.  The progression from less complex to more complex can be demonstrated.   I think that is very interesting...|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Although this is not specifically mentioned in Darwin's main points, Creationists who know big words have always talked about the Second Law of Thermodynamics, that states that, over time, entropy increases;  things break down from complex to simple.<br>  <br>  That is, they point out that things cannot go from from simple to complex because of that Second Law.  This is true in a closed system, but they forget that living things are NOT closed systems, that energy is always entering, and increasing complexity IS possible in an open system.|`|9NcZTroJaa	Well, common sense forces me to reject part of this theory if not the whole theory itself.<br>  1) "Change is gradual and slow", but how gradual & slow?<br>  2) "Change takes place over a long time", but how long?<br>  <br>  Some of this theory if not the whole itself is purely suggestive due to a lack of concret observation involved. From cave man era to modern one, does anyone ever see a chimp is in the process of becoming a human being?|`|eqp3aWPYaa	My theory about Darwin is that he was adopted.|`|9y1cISQtaa	Many people would find the use of "creation scientist" a contradiction in terms, as most of modern science point towards the neo-darwinian theory of evolution, although there are some other theories including intelligent design. Quite often creationists use examples that support evolutionary theory as examples to support their own needs, so should be considered carefully. One such example is the duck billed platypus. The platypus has recently had it's genome mapped, confirming evolutionary biologists' belief that it is an example of how mammals and birds evolved from reptiles since genetically, it shares a lot of genes with these animals. However creationist scientists may say that this animal is so strange that it could not have evolved thus (actually thats quite a simplified explanation but it illustrates the point).  In my current and previous university there was a book sent out to every biological department; this "atlas of creation" innocently sat on the shelf for about a month bfeore anyone had a proper look at it, and when they did so it was found to be what can only be described as "creationist propoganda", with large colour photoraphs of fossils and modern counterparts that look similar and so the author said it was "proof that these things have been around for a long time and were put there by God", however there was no explanation for the genetic and not to mention morphological differences or any kind of scientific evidence. This book blamed Darwin for the rise of world wars 1 and 2 among various other accusations, and of course is not really a good example of what ALL creationists believe! Having met a couple of people who said they did not believe in evolution, it confuses me that something so simple cannot be accepted. You know that a son resembles his father, and he his father, and so on; so why not accept that if this were to happen over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, there would be a great cumulative change much bigger than what you see in a lifetime. I know that this is going to sound very biased coming from a biological scientist but at the end of the day there is too much pressure put on people to either "believe" in science or God, you can accept and understand and even love science without having to be an athiest, because at the end of the day faith is, by definition, something you cannot prove - you just have to believe it. <br>  <br>  Sorry if that was a bit of a rant!|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	There have been many claims as to problems with both the theory and the evidence for evolution, most of which have been shown to be incorrect.  Take a look at this web site for the creationist's claims:<br>  <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/." rel="nofollow">http://www.answersingenesis.org/.</a>  Note, they also have a section on what arguments they have given up on!  <br>  <br>  The most recent arguments have been in therms of "intelligent design" although there is no evidence for it, and it has been banned in the schools (see the Kitzmiller vs. Dover trial).

mH1Tnv5Naa	The Earth is in orbit.  That means that the forward momentum of the Earth, which would otherwise cause the Earth to move in a straight line, is balanced by the inward pull of the Sun, which causes the Earths path to curve. The two forces combine to make the Earth move in a circular (actually slightly elliptical) path around the Sun.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Inertia is that physical characteristic that wants to keep mass at the same momentum p = mv.  This means the velocity v of a moving mass m like the Earth wants to go in a straight line and not change speed.  <br>  <br>  As Earth m is whizzing past the Sun, inertia wants to keep Earth in a straight line; in which case it would fly off into space.  It would have left the Sun long ago but for the Sun's gravity.<br>  <br>  Gravity pulls at the moving Earth; so it bends its otherwise straight velocity vector a slight bit inward towards the Sun.  But in pulling the Earth a bit toward it, the Sun also gives Earth a bit more kinetic energy and, therefore, velocity.  And that increased velocity, again, wants to fly on out into space because of inertia.<br>  <br>  And there we have it, Earth does not fall into the Sun because inertia keeps tugging away from it.  That is, gravity tugs inward and inerta tugs outward at about the same force; so they are balanced.  The result is that the Earth stays at or about 93 million miles from the Sun and does not fall into it.|`|MufqgZzGaa	because science is wrong.<br>  <br>  but if you want to hear their explanation: the reason it doesn't crash is because it travels so fast, and the reason it travels fast is because of a big bang that happened 13 billion years ago.|`|TlXLKVEOaa	the earths speed and orbit going around the sun keeps the earth from diving into it.

Lets assume you have a signal which is low level and unable to drive the actuator you wish to control. An amplifier is used to increase the signal strength to a point that it will now operate he actuator. However, the amplified signal must be a true but amplified copy of the original input signal, the amplifier must have a linear gain throughout the stated input range, hence a linear amplifier or linear buffer.

fLHs5dd1aa	Well, they do. That's where interference comes from. However, in general, you're not talking about light rays when you're trying to accurately model optics on the level of multimode fibers- you have to, at some point, move to more accurate models, i.e. Gaussian optics. Also, it's faulty to consider "collisions" when you're talking about photonics- think to your experience with quantum mechanics, and the particle-wave duality. Although thinking about photons and phonons is useful up until a point, you generally have to consider the "wave" aspect of photons when they interact.<br>  <br>  Check your reasoning about "carrying so many single modes". Single mode fiber means just that- it carries one, low-energy mode. Multimode fiber carries many higher-energy modes, which means more opportunity for interference and thus lower bandwidth.<br>  <br>  In general, single-mode fibers are good when you need a very clean signal without a need for high power- their apertures are about 10 um, and hence very difficult to get a clean coupling into- and multimode is good for when you need to get the maximal amount of light.|`|4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	Light does not 'interfere', since electromagnetic fields obey linear superposition.  But think more about dispersion, and how the information encoded on light can be affected if it is carried by light of various frequencies, when those signals travel at different velocities.  All manner of tricks are employed to design optical fiber to deal with this for various applications.

LoFeJztxaa	Exact formulas for solving cubic equations were discovered by Cardano and others in Italy in the 1500's.  For the equation you give Vieta's substitution can be used.  <br>  <br>  X^3 + X + 4 = 0<br>  <br>  Let X = y + s / y where s is a constant to be determined.  Plug in:<br>  <br>  (y + s / y)^3 + (y + s / y) + 4 = 0.<br>  <br>  Do the algebra, i.e. multiply it out and simplify.  After multiplying both sides by y^3 the result will be:<br>  <br>  y^6 + (1+3s) y^4 + 4 y^3 + s(1+3s) y^2 + s^3 = 0<br>  <br>  Now notice that if we choose s = -1/3 then both the y^4 and the y^2 term drop out!  So put s = -1/3<br>  <br>  This gives:<br>  <br>  y^6 + 4y^3 - 1/27 = 0<br>  <br>  Let y^3 = u so that y^6 = u^2 and you get the quadratic equation:<br>  <br>  u^2 + 4u - 1/27 = 0,  rewrite:<br>  <br>  u^2 + 4u = 1/27,  now add 4 to both sides, completing the square:<br>  <br>  u^2 + 4u + 4 = 1/27 + 4, factor the left side, do the arithmetic on right side:<br>  <br>  (u + 2)^2 = 109/27, take square root of both sides:<br>  <br>  u + 2 = ± √(109/27), so<br>  <br>  u = -2 ± √(109/27).  Now work backwards, since y^3 = u we have<br>  <br>  y = (-2 ± √(109/27))^(1/3),  the 1/3 exponent means cube root.<br>  <br>  Finally, X = y + s / y where s = -1/3, i.e X = y - 1/(3y), so<br>  <br>  X =  (-2 ± √(109/27))^(1/3) - 1/(3*((-2 ± √(109/27))^(1/3)))<br>  <br>  If you choose the plus sign in both places and calculate you will get:<br>  <br>  X = -1.378796729 approximately.<br>  <br>  The other two roots are complex numbers.<br>  <br>  Not very intuitive, but I'm afraid there is no easier way.|`|bTHhpGanaa	y = x^3 + x + 4 = 0<br>  you are correct, +/- 1,2,4 are not the roots, so try<br>  plotting the curve on a calc and find the x-intercept.|`|xKWeKLOwaa	Nope , Its really Simple Actually .<br>  <br>  Take X common from both the tersms:-<br>  <br>  It becomes X(X^2+1)=-4<br>  <br>  Now you get two different Equations :-<br>  <br>  X = -4 and X^2+1=-4<br>  <br>  Therfore , Answers are -4,-sqroot(3)i ,+sqroot(3)i|`|hiflzw3paa	<a href="http://www.1728.com/cubic2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.1728.com/cubic2.htm</a><br>  <br>  Thats the best I can do|`|ec47bbd09ff22cb037891dcc314d3c08aa	im really rusted already.. i noe the answer is -1.3788 but im trying to get the working out for u..

ossCVxPqaa	Standard air pressure, when expressed in bar, is 1000mbar. Therefore a pressure of 1022.2 millibars would be a slightly high, but achievable air pressure.  It would be impossible to have an atmospheric pressure of 222 922.2 mbar. This would be 222 atmospheres. This type of pressure may be used in certain industries and laboratory research, but I doubt if the pressure would be expressed in mbar

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	We do not see the edge of the universe.<br>  <br>  We see the "edge" of space-time, a construct that results form the finite (and relatively slow) speed of light.<br>  <br>  As we look far in distance, we are also looking back in time.  When we look at a star at 10 light-years, we see it as it was 10 years ago.<br>  <br>  When we look at a galaxy 1 billion light-years away, we see it as it was a billion years ago.<br>  <br>  What we do notice is that when we look at things that are far away (and, therefore, "far" in the past), the universe was different:  it was hotter and denser.<br>  <br>  So, we can add another line to our trend:<br>  look far = look in the past = look at a hotter universe.<br>  <br>  The average temperature is now around 3 K (three degrees above absolute zero).  To give you an idea of the scale, the boiling point of water is around 373 K and the Sun's surface is around 5700 K.  However, most of the universe is very cold, so that the average works out to 3 K.<br>  <br>  At some point in the past (13 billion years ago), the average temperature of the universe was above 3000 K.  We know (because we can test this in labs) that hydrogen is not transparent when it is hotter than that (that is why we cannot see inside the Sun).<br>  <br>  Therefore, we cannot see further into the past than the moment when the universe was around 3000 K (at the time, the entire universe was mostly hydrogen, some helium and a pinch of a few other light elements).<br>  <br>  So, working with the trend we had earlier (look far = look in the past = look at a hotter universe) and turning it backwards:<br>  <br>   look at a hotter universe = look in the past = look far<br>  <br>  --the edge is really at a temperature of 3000 K;  it is caused by temperature, not by time or distance.<br>  <br>  --because of that, it allows us to reach as far back as 13 billion years<br>  <br>  --and that is why we cannot see further "away" than 13 billion light-years.<br>  <br>  This is true, regardless of the real size of the universe, or even if the universe were really infinite in extent.  It is time and temperature that causes the apparent "edge"<br>  <br>  This answers your first and third questions.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  For the second:<br>  <br>  The universe is expanding.  This seems to go along with the fact that it is cooling (and getting less dense) with time.<br>  <br>  Since light takes time to get to us from distant objects (on the scale of the universe, light is slow), the universe expands while the light travels to get here.<br>  <br>  This gives us the recession.<br>  <br>  Because the universe expands while the light from a galaxy comes here, we see that galaxy as "moving away" from us at a speed that is determined by the rate of expansion.  That galaxy is not moving, relative to its own local space.  In fact, if there were astronomers there and they were looking at our Galaxy, they would think that we are the ones moving away from them.<br>  <br>  What really happens is that space is being "added" between that galaxy and us.  The rate at which space is added gives us the impression of speed (speed = distance / time;  if the distance increases with time, then it looks like speed).<br>  <br>  It is possible to determine the rate at which this "speed" increases with apparent distance (= how far into the past we look).<br>  <br>  Comparing this rate with the distance, we can calculate the distance at which the speed of recession would appear to be the same as the speed of light.  That distance is 13.7 billion light-years away.  This means that any light that would come from that far would have traveled for 13.7 billion years.<br>  <br>  We can also calculate that, at that moment, the temperature and density of the universe are well beyond anything we can calculate.  I do not want to use the word "infinity" but it would work as a description of temperature and density.<br>  <br>  The highest temperature that makes sense to us is called the Planck Temperature (from the name of a scientist who worked on such problems): at that temperature, every single point in the universe would have been a black hole.  How do you explain anything hotter? I don't know.<br>  <br>  So, this is the moment that we call the beginning of the universe.  In reality, it marks the beginning of the expansion that we can perceive.  It is also the first moment where time (as we perceive it) makes sense to us.  The word "before" makes no sense at that moment.<br>  <br>  That is why we give the time elapsed since then (13.7 thousand million years) as the "age" of the universe.  We are quite sure of that number; we are not very sure of what came "before", if anything.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	The Cosmic Microwave Background gives us the age of the Universe<br>  <br>  We cannot see past the CMB, so we do not know what is beyond it|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	we can't. the most distant objects we can see are 13.9 billion light years away and they all have severe red shift.

Now it is speeding up again but it's no wear near the speed of light.  We can tell this by the redshift of all galaxies.

QPWjtDzcaa	It was discovered about three days before it's close approach.  I first heard about it about a day and a half later, when it was already determined that it would miss earth by about forty thousand miles.  Small asteroid close calls don't get much media attention.  Most of the world is completely unaware that one struck our atmosphere back in October.<br>  <br>  There are tens of thousands of NEO's that are discovered in short notice of close approaches, however, the thing that makes them so elusive...  their small size...  also makes them limited threat.<br>  <br>  This object is about the same size of the Tunguska (1908) impact...  on that "exploded" in the atmosophere and leveled many trees and broke windows...    If this one would have impacted earth, devasataion would have likely been similar...  isolated within a small region of the earth.  If it were to strike land, the forces involved would be rather intimidating.  I'll let some of the physics junkies crunch the numbers and tell you the devastation range for that possibility.<br>  <br>  NASA (and other organizations as well) is tracking numerous NEO's and have estimated risk analysis for all of the *known* potential impactors.  Most of these are no more dangerous than earthly natural disasters, and there is no outcry for people to stop earthquakes, cyclones, tornadoes, volcanoes or hurricanes...  so there seems to be a general public bias against "death from the skies" versus "death from the earth."|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	It was minimal 63,500  km away from Earth and guess how the people are called, who found out that this object passed so close to Earth: Astronomers. It was discovered 3 days before the perigee passage. Yes, they found it before. Just not early enough to do any kind of defense... luckily it missed.<br>  <br>  It is one Earth Crosser asteroid of the Apollo family, it is not too uncommon too miss one of them, especially if they are hidden by the sun. The largest object of this family of asteroids is 10 km large. A 20-45 m large asteroid is not really dangerous. 20m is just the minimum size for asteroids to reach the Surface of Earth.|`|WkWedRnoaa	It was first seen about three days prior to its closest approach which was around 40,000 miles.<br>  <br>  Astronomers did not know about it before, but do now.<br>  <br>  There will be a next time, and though usually we get lucky, that won't always be the case, as was seen in Tunguska in 1908.<br>  <br>  Though we've probably located everything that crosses the Earth's orbit that is a mile or more in diameter, there are thousands of Earth crossers down to the size of small cars that we've never seen, such as this one, which was somewhere between 70 & 150 feet in diameter.  These rocks are too small and dim to be seen when they are farthest from us, and many come at us from the direction of the sun, which makes them extremely difficult to spot early.  Although a number of groups are trying to find and catalogue all the possible dangerous asteroids that zip by us on occasion, it is going to take decades until we can be reasonably certain that nothing is going to sneak up on us like this one did.|`|TqtzzsHjaa	They knew about it a few days before it happened as far as im aware.|`|Ox3AtKRKaa	Thy must have known by the same way you knew.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	As I understand it, 2009 DD45 was only discovered a few days prior to passing by.

However, had it hit would probably have been in the ocean (given it's flight path).<br>  <br>  So, yes, the astronomical community knew about it but didn't have a lot of time to warn the public.  It missed us by a scant 27,000 miles but we had one 5 years ago (Mar. 1, 2004) that missed us by just 4,000 miles.<br>  <br>  One of the difficulties we have in detecting some asteroids is when the approach us directly from the sun.  They're almost impossible to see. So, yeah, we found a couple "after the fact" but as of today we've found and track over 1035 (see las link below).  <br>  <br>  Right now with the current technology and funding we're doing the best we can do.  Contrast that to 1995 when we were doing almost nothing to track these objects and you'll see that we've come a long way.<br>  <br>  If you think it's important that we do more about these objects then  please write your congressman or senator with your concerns.  NASA needs more funding to track and develop a method to deal with this issue.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	who the heck do you think detected it? used car dealers?
CSysSbnlaa	Yes, cats do see the paranormal. They are very sensitive to spirits. Whenever my moms cat, Kelly, hears something that isn't a human she looks over where the sound came from. Cats know where spirits are and I know since I can see spirits. So Kelly and I would see something. Also, we have guardian angels and that was proved scientifically. We have like our own procession of guardian angels. Whenever I'm home alone and I say something Kelly always looks around me and she will keep looking at the space around me. It is said we should meet our main spirit guide in a dream. Most people can't see their little entourage of spirits but a very tiny number of people can see their spirit guides and I mean not just in a dream but all the time. <br>  I can feel the spirits around me since I see ghosts and stuff. It's like having humans crowding you at all times. These spirits can heal you when sick because they're like, your guides. Well, this is off subject. But yes, cats do see the paranormal.<br>  Good day!<br>  ~Midnightrose|`|H6KvVXnraa	I totally believe that cats can sense and/or see spirits.  Have you ever noticed how they can sense something coming before we can? ie, someone coming to the door etc. All of their senses are stronger than ours in my opinion.  I think that they are much more in tune with 'otherworldly' things because there is no one to tell them they are crazy or imagining it.|`|f75f1f375524c86801b6480a227d61c4aa	Yes they can sense spirits and dogs can too. My brother came down to my house with his dog a few weeks ago and she was sitting on my lap, next thing her head started turning slowly like she was following something in to the kitchen, then she jumped off me and followed whatever it was in there. She was'nt growling or barking so that made me feel comfotable knowing that whatever it was, it was'nt bad.|`|FByBcUeeaa	Dead on Jess, No joke intended.

Cats have better vision then we do and many times when it looks like they are staring at nothing, they are really staring at  dust bunnies. There is even one episode of Sabrina the Teenage witch where at the end of the sow Salem the human turned cat is watching a dust bunnie for hours and Sabrina joins him after he shows her where to look.<br>  <br>  Cats also have very good hearing and will at times be reacting to noises outside or sometimes a rat or mouse or bug in the wall that we cannot hear.|`|6upsduhDaa	I used to live in an old house and my cat used to stare at the top of the stairs for ages. (The house was open plan, the stairs were in the lounge) When I got a kitten, they BOTH used to stare at the top of the stairs. It freaked me out.

It seemed they both enjoyed it.<br>  When the shi-tzu died we buried him in the garden, wrapping him in towels and plastic and sealing it. We placed a slab of concrete on top. The same evening the cat came in and curled up on top of the slab. Normally if we went out in the garden the cat would run away but this time he wouldn't budge and stayed on the grave all night.<br>  Our other Shi-tzu died two years later and again the cat sat on the grave but only for about an hour this time.<br>  We've never understood why the cat did this but think he knew his pal was dead|`|aDudTXwDaa	Mmy house, which use to be haunted, has a stairs that curves left  at a right degree angle with a square platform at the turn; anyway there i use to have a dog that would go everywhere through out the house except  up the second part of the stairs. My room  was directly at the top of the stairs . HE would stop in his tracks and bark at nothing at the top of the stairs. Even when we tried to move him he would keep his head turned to the top of my stairs and bark at nothing. Our house was haunted i guess, i was a child at the time.

Animals have never lost their instinct to be in tune with their surroundings. I have an elderly dog and a young dog, both who react to things that we cannot see. The younger one I will pass off sometimes as hearing a sound that is not audible to human ears (someone on the street outside or the neighbours moving around their home), the elderly one is both deaf and blind, yet she will start to wag her tail and give little cries of happiness ( as she used to do whenever our old dog came into the room before he was pts) for no apparent reason. I have heard of numerous cats and dogs that behave as you describe, so in answer to your question, yes, I do believe that cats can see ghosts and spirits.|`|24H5tznkaa	Yes, I do think that cats can see spirits..among other things.

After each "predicted" doomsday passes with nothing happening there is a new one invented.  I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the History (Hysteria) Channel.  The content isn’t about any real 2012 event happening and it isn’t about history. It is about selling books and selling advertising on the TV programs.  <br>  <br>  There is no scientific theory that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. ZERO scientists believe that anything out of the ordinary will happen in 2012.  It is all total CRAP.  These people are interested in one thing - MONEY.  And by listening to their programs and/or buying their books you provide them with - MONEY.  The more MONEY they make the more twists and turns they invent to make it more interesting so you will listen to new TV programs so they can make even MORE MONEY.<br>  <br>  If you had hogwash to sell wouldn’t you try and package it so looked like prime rib?

Only about FIVE HUNDRED GAZILLION TIMES.<br>  <br>  >Can people please explain what is meant to happen and why!!<br>  <br>  The date, December 21 2012, is acquired from a property of the ancient mayan calendar. The mayans had names for different time periods measured in days, one of which, the baktun, is 144000 days or a little under 400 years. Based on when their calendar started, the 13th baktun will come to an end on December 21, 2012, and the mayan calendar 'zeroes' will 'roll over' on that date just as the zeroes in the gregorian year 'rolled over' going from 1999 (three nines in a row) to 2000 (three zeroes in a row). Basically, it's the mayan equivalent of the 'end of the millennium', only for them it would happen about every 395 years rather than 1000 years. Now, the important thing is that in mayan mythology, the Universe had several previous incarnations, each of which was in some sense a failure and was therefore ended when it hit the end of its 13th baktun. The idea, of course, is that at the end of the 13th baktun in this universe, either the universe will come to an end, or some sort of apocalypse will occur and cause widespread destruction and chaos on Earth. The various mechanisms usually brought up for this purpose include:<br>  - Some unknown planet in the Solar System (generally known as either 'Nibiru' or 'Planet X' or both) will approach very close to and/or crash into the Earth.<br>  - The Earth's magnetic poles will reverse, allowing charged particles from the Sun to hit the surface of the Earth and kill us all.<br>  - The Earth and the Sun will line up with the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, which by some unexplained mechanism will cause lots of gamma rays to hit the Earth and kill us all.<br>  - The Large Hadron collider will create a black hole that will consume the Earth.<br>  - Jesus will return, bringing forth the biblical Judgement Day and the Rapture.<br>  As you may expect, none of these proposed events is in any way even remotely suggested or upheld by any reasonable scientific evidence. Furthermore, the mayans themselves never actually said that this universe would end on the 13th baktun, and in fact their mythology involved predictions of events which they scheduled to occur, in this universe, at dates later than December 21 2012, in some cases even thousands of years later. In every rational sense whatsoever, the 'mayan doomsday' is a load of patent bullcrap.<br>  <br>  >I dont want you to tell me that you think it is a load of rubbish<br>  <br>  But it is.|`|W2suykEtaa	people, and I use the word in a general sense, like you, will stop asking this fool question.<br>  <br>  "Is there any poison you can give your wife that the police can't trace?

Try telling me how many pounds of iron oxide to mix with five pounds of aluminum dust to make thermite without it. If you get really far into chemistry you'll see things like the equations governing electron orbitals, and quantum physics is about as hard as math ever gets.<br>  <br>  In the age of computers you will have to do relatively little math by hand, but you still need to understand it well enough to know how to ask the calculator the right question.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Yes when you're calculating things like the number of atoms or molecules that need to come together in a reaction to make a certain number after the reaction, based on the number of electrons they have in their outer ring. When I was doing advanced chem at age 14-16 there were quite a lot of people who struggled with that part of the subject so I guess it's quite hard if you're not good at math but it shouldn't be too difficult to learn with a bit of practice and effort.|`|F4phWwBdaa	Chemistry does involve math. It isn't always difficult math.<br>  For example, if we had a bottle filled with 1.0L of air at a pressure of 3atm, how much pressure would there be in a bottle filled with 5L air?<br>  You would use a formula (many problems have a formula, which makes it easier)<br>  P1V1 = P2V2<br>  (3.0atm)(1.0L) = (x atm)(5.0L)<br>  [(3atm)(1.0L)]/5.0L = 0.6atm<br>  Not every question is as simple as that, but learning how to substitute values is essential. Additionally, learning/knowing how to cancel out variables is valuable (such as in the above question, I canceled the L, leaving me with just atm). Be a little vigilant. Double check! Most of all, if you (try to) enjoy it, it will be much easier and you'll stay calm. You do not have to be great at math to be good at chemistry, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't help to be good at math.|`|xxVWCHTJaa	Well, Simple answer.... Yes<br>  <br>  Example<br>  An Ion is an element that has lost/gained electrons to become stable therefore it has a charge.<br>  An electron has a negative charge.<br>  And a proton has a positive.<br>  Elements have the same amount of protons and electrons so that they are neutral. When they lose an electron the have a charge of +1 because they have a "spare" proton and if they gain an electron it would have a charge of -1 because it has an extra electron... And it gets more complicated than just one gained/lost.<br>  <br>  Personally I think it's easy... but I think that's just because I'm a sciency sort of person...|`|DyHpuiR8aa	Yes it does - I hated chemistry with a passion, but I was fine with maths.<br>  <br>  There are certain calculations you need to do - like calculating the number of moles of a substance, or the pH of some things.<br>  <br>  The calculations aren't too hard, since you're given most of the formulae, you've just to learn them & slot in the right values.  However, you MUST learn the formulae, as very few of them are provided in the exam.<br>  <br>  As for examples - I'm not sure what level you're doing, so I don't want to scare you off with anything...<br>  <br>  However, some of the easy ones include calculating the mass of the substance, given you have the relative atomic mass and the number of moles (You would use the m = n x rfm.  m= mass, n = number of moles, rfm = relative formula/atomic mass)<br>  <br>  You do them all year though, so that's plenty of time to get used to them etc.<br>  <br>  P.S:  If maths is putting you off taking chemistry - stop thinking like that.  Chemistry is a valued qualification in almost every line of work - you may find yourself later in life needing to get a chem qualification to proceed in your studies, so you'd be best getting it done as soon as possible.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	Yes, like most things.

YYLybWHSaa	We have a circulatory system with a pump to move the blood plasma fluids bearing food & oxygen around & around through our bodies but plants don't. We have a separate skeletal system for support.<br>  <br>  Plants have very narrow tubes that run in lineal columns up from a root to a limb. This is why if a set of roots are damaged the limbs they supply with water will wither. There is no transfer across the plant; the flow either goes up or it goes down. The xylem and phloem separate the flows. Xylem bears water with dissolved mineral nutrients from root to leaf primarily powered by passive transpiration while phloem transports sap, with the dissolved photosynthate as sucrose, actively. <br>  <br>  One other similarity is that blood is constantly renewed by bone marrow stem cells just as the plants lateral meristem regrows the cambium to renew the phloem and xylem. Animals constantly renew their transport cells while plants renew their transport vesicles.<br>  <br>  The roots take up water (and its solutes) by having more salt ions than the soil. The roots actively create the osmotic gradient for the water to follow. Once in the root system water is pulled up the xylem by water evaporating from the top of the xylem column among the leaves. The plant stops the flow, preventing excess water loss, by closing the pores in the leaf, the stomata. Because photosynthesis requires water in the first photon reaction the photosynthetic rate is limited if water is limited. <br>   Xylem's structure is duel purpose. The hardened cell wall supports the plants height and the dead cells losing the end plates open themselves into a continuous capillary tube for water transport. The open columnar xylem structure moves water vertically faster than the water moves laterally by osmosis to the rest of the plant. The dead cells have limited period of use in transport so are replaced annually. The older xylem structure remains in the center of the tree becoming the heartwood. This allows the tree to become taller as the heartwood increases in diameter so becomes the tress skeleton.<br>  <a href="http://hcs.osu.edu/hort/biology/ptranslo.html" rel="nofollow">http://hcs.osu.edu/hort/biology/ptranslo...</a><br>  Plant structure<br>  <a href="http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/botanicalsciences/PlantsStructure/PlantStructureGrowth/PlantStructureGrowth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/scie...</a><br>  Plant roots<br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=G95kKjM_cmkC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=xylem+water+transfer+to+plant&source=web&ots=Q2JFP2eF6r&sig=8ZI-Vx1bKppl7CmbD-8QD5zUF5g" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=G95kKjM...</a><br>  Roots are the limiting factor in water uptake<br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TD1-41KW8J4-M&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=121426653fb6759fc07bb3814610921a" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob...</a><br>  Water is moved with diurnal rhythms<br>  <a href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/12/1384" rel="nofollow">http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/conten...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The phloem are the living transport tubes that move the product of photosynthesis as sap. Other hormonal molecules that regulate plant growth and defense are also transported via these passages. This is not just a passive flow down a concentration gradient it is assisted by active transport. The flow is seasonally controlled to move to the root region for dormant storage or to the leaves & cambium for use in growth. Most plants have some form of storage for seasonal periodicity if they are perennial.<br>  The direction of phloem flow is based on demand and source. In spring bud break the roots are the source so flow is towards the leaves. Once leaves are regrown and photosynthetic they are the source and the phloem flow can reverse but the destination can be flowers, fruit, general tissue growth or roots.<br>  <br>  Once the photosynthesis of glucose is complete the glucose is made into sucrose and transported to the 'sink' or point of use or storage depending on season. Sucrose is the form transported in a plant stem for reason that it is nonreducing so does not react with oxygen in transport. Osmolality for sucrose is better than glucose, for each single molecule transported twice the energy is moved to storage. Finally sucrose impacts guard cell regulation of stomata opening cross linking control of transpiration with photosynthesis.<br>  <br>  <br>  Translocation of food<br>  <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Phloem.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...</a><br>  <br>  Whole plant transport integration - Water exchanges between xylem, and phloem.

Maple syrup is actually just the sugary sap of the maple tree. This sap is carried up the stem using capillary action (surface tension makes the fluid rise upwards, like a very narrow straw) rather than having a heart pump it. The sap is mostly water with simple sugars and other trace metals and such the tree requires to continue building new cells.<br>  <br>  Waste products from the tree are sent out via the pores on its leaves into the atmosphere rather than carrying the waste back down into the earth. of course, a tree's waste products are oxygen and complex sugars!

Having to live permenantly in farming villages and cities meant humans were perhaps domesticated by animals.<br>  <br>  FYI: Humans are not the only creatures to ranch and farm.

If you are comparing the quantity of two material things, you have to take into account what they are, not just how many of them there are.  That's why all those word problems you get which have to do with units of measure have you convert to like units before you perform any mathematical operations.  For example, how much is 1 pound and 1 ounce?  Adding 1 and 1 doesn't help, because it isn't 2 pounds or 2 ounces.  You can either convert the 1 pound to 16 ounces and then add that extra ounce or you could convert that 1 ounce to 1/16 of a pound then add.  Or, you could just leave them as is and say that you have 1 pound and 1 ounce.<br>  <br>  So, the object you are considering affects the math you perform.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	No, the number one cannot represent a dumbell.

nTKuRFlKaa	*Chromium  is a chemical element which has the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is a steely-gray, lustrous, hard metal that takes a high polish and has a high melting point. It is also odorless, tasteless, and malleable.<br>  <br>  *Chromium was regarded with great interest due to its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding chromium and nickel to form stainless steel. This application and electroplating are currently the highest-volume uses of the metal. Chromium and ferro-chromium are produced from the single commercially viable ore —chromite— by silicothermic or aluminothermic reaction or by roasting and leaching processes.<br>  <br>  *The strengthening effect on steel by forming stable carbide grains at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5 % of chromium. A important stainless steel is 18/10 stainless, made from iron with 10% nickel and 18% chromium, is widely used for cookware and cutlery. For these applications ferrochromium is added to the molten iron.<br>  <br>  *Uses:<br>  # As a catalyst.<br>  # Potassium dichromate is a chemical reagent, used in cleaning laboratory glassware and as a titrating agent. It is also used as a mordant (i.e., a fixing agent) for dyes in fabric.<br>  # Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is used to manufacture magnetic tape, where its higher coercivity than iron oxide tapes gives better performance.<br>  # In well drilling muds as an anti-corrosive.<br>  # In medicine, as a dietary supplement or slimming aid, usually as chromium(III) chloride, chromium(III) picolinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate or as an amino acid chelate, such as chromium(III) D-phenylalanine.<br>  # Chromium hexacarbonyl (Cr(CO)6) is used as a gasoline additive.<br>  # Chromium boride (CrB) is used as a high-temperature electrical conductor.<br>  #Chromium is used to harden steel, manufacture stainless steel, and form many useful alloys. It is mostly used in plating to produce a hard, beautiful surface and to prevent corrosion. Chromium gives glass an emerald green color and is widely used as a catalyst.<br>  <br>  The refractory industry uses chromite  for forming bricks and shapes, as it has a high melting point, moderate thermal expansion, and stability of crystalline structure. <br>  #Chromium is used as a catalyst in ammonia synthesis, in the production of chromium steels, stainless steels and chromium alloys and for electroplating. Organic complexes are used as development dyes in colour photography. Inorganic chromium compounds are used as paint pigments. Chromium(VI) salts are widely used in wood preservation and leather tannery.|`|9Wi2eNInaa	It's shiny like a mirror, it doesn't rust and it's very hard.<br>  <br>  Chrome is just a short word for the element chromium.<br>  <br>  Chrome plating is used for decoration on cars, trucks and motorcycle for shiny rims, mirrors, headlights and trim.<br>  <br>  Chrome is mixed with iron and nickel to make stainless steel, which is very hard steel and it doesn't corrode.<br>  <br>  Chrome is plated onto hydraulic and air cylinders (the cylinder shafts and inside tubes) to give a very hard surface that doesn't wear and is impervious to leakage of fluids or air.<br>  <br>  If you look at construction excavators and backhoes you will see the chrome plated hydraulic cylinders are the shiny tubes that move the buckets and diggers|`|sRl3pWG8aa	Chromium is a steely-gray, lustrous, hard metal. When used in electroplating, the material is generally called Chrome.<br>  <br>  Hard chrome or engineered chrome, is used to reduce friction, add wear resistance, or increase corrosion resistance. It is very hard, measuring between 66 to 70 HRC. Hard chrome lacks the bright color which is seen in decorative chrome plating. Most of the decorative chrome color comes from Nickel plating.|`|ii0hMr0caa	It is a major constituent in stainless steel, it can be deposited onto other metals to give a shiny rust resistant surface.

Pretty straightforward.<br>  <br>  4. energy before is mgh = mg*1000ft<br>  <br>  From thermo (and high school chem):<br>  Q = Cp * m * ΔT<br>  <br>  This Q is heat flow (energy), not fluid flow rate Q!<br>  <br>  So, if Cp (specific heat of steel) is in J/g°C, and mass in g, and the ΔTemperature is in C°, then Q is in J.<br>  <br>  Equate the two, convert PE to BTU's, cancel out the m's on each side, and you're done.<br>  <br>  7. Look at the references for the head form. I believe you just divide through by gh. Plug in the units to show everything is in height.<br>  <br>  8. Use B's. The before is in the pipe; after is after the difuser. use a horizontal streamline so no change in elevation. Consider frictionless case. Energy before is ?mv2, energy after is all in pressure. Calculate. Internal energy is waste heat, so zero for frictionless diffuser. Case 2: deduct 10% of the perfect case, it shows up as waste heat (similar to problem 4). Case 3: assume everything turns to waste heat.<br>  <br>  Use B's to get velocity. Before, energy is pressure outside hull at 10m. After, ?mv2. Now, Q=V*A, calculate flow rate Q.<br>  <br>  18. Use B's to get flowrate out. Engineering toolbox link has similar problem. Then, drop in level is Q=V*A. V is dh/dt, of course.<br>  <br>  <br>  24. B's again. Put in the pressures before and after.<br>  <br>  25. B's again. Don't forget to subtract a bunch of energy (see Engineering Toolbox link again.

Whichever of these are insoluble will be produced through reaction. The soluble ones will not be produced, because all ions remain in solution.
AA11432707	Try using a scopolomine patch (Transderm Scop, it's commonly used for seasickness).  The patch should be placed BEFORE surgery and can be kept on for days.<br>  <br>  Also, ask your anesthesiologist about a dose of dexamethasone during surgery, along with whatever antiemetic he/she is planning to use.  Those will help with N&V after surgery, and can last a bit into the post-op period as well.<br>  <br>  Another option for some surgeries is regional blockade (numbing medicine in the areas that hurt), but that depends on what you're having done.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|eulMjLtPaa	Have you determined if it's the acetaminophen in the vicodin or percoset that's the problem?

Unfortunately, the severity of nausea changes from patient to patient. It can be lessened by taking the medication with food or an anti-emetic (anti-nausea) medication. Your surgeon or doctor might be able to prescribe an anti-emetic along with the pain prescription (like Phenergan or Zofran) to ease the side effects. Phenergan comes as a suppository so you don't have to worry about vomiting it up and not getting the full effect from it. Depending on the surgery, you might not have much of a choice because you'll need something strong enough for the pain.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

So we are recovering from a little ice age and therefore are in a general warming trend.  There are a lot of things that a weatherman probably has learned that you don't understand.  So he has an opinion that is counter to what you are hearing about global warming.  But the discussion is about what is called anthropomorphic global warming which contends that human activity is causing even more warming than the normal warming.  There are serious scientists who disagree with the consensus about this warming so just because your local weatherman doesn't agree either doesn't make him an idiot.

"he aint come here" and i was like yes he did and he was like ask your mom because i don't remember him being in here. so i asked like all my family members and they all said freaking no. <br>  so the next day we was still at the hospital and my cousin walked into the waiting room the exact same way I 'saw' him walk in that other day. same outfit same everything.<br>  i was so freaked out i just decided not to tell anyone this|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	No, not at all. There are things we can do to predict some aspects of the future, usually involving mathematical models and analysis of trends, but psychically "seeing" something happen in the future is fiction. This doesn't mean that someone can't dream or daydream something vague and then search for an event later on to "shoe-horn" into their dream. In fact I think this mind trick is what leads many people to think they might have precognition.|`|duVTqRM4aa	There have been just too many instances in my own life where I had a premonition and it came true.

F8zjiOJ4aa	Muscle contraction occurs when the actin and myosin filaments in muscle are driven past each other by a cyclic interaction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and actin with cross-bridges that extend from myosin. Current biochemical studies suggest that, during each adenosine triphosphatase cycle, the myosin cross-bridge alternates between two main conformations, which differ markedly in their strength of binding to actin and in their overall structure. Binding of ATP to the cross-bridge induces the weak-binding conformation, whereas inorganic phosphate release returns the cross-bridge to the strong-binding conformation. This cross-bridge cycle is similar to the kinetic cycle that drives active transport and illustrates the general principles of free energy transduction by adenosine triphosphatase systems.

27bf67894cbc5cfa304dbe2b01a0b7a3aa	SHORT ANSWER:<br>  Liquids and gasses = CONVECTION<br>  Solids = CONDUCTION<br>  <br>  Each given molecule in a liquid or gas is relatively far apart; the actions of one molecule does not have a profound effect on the neighboring molecules. <br>  <br>  LONG ANSWER:<br>  For CONVECTION currents, as a substance is heated, the molecules making up that substance expand and become less dense. The molecules closest to the heat source (eg. the bottom of a pot of water on the stove) heat up the quickest and rise to the top. Colder, and thus denser, molecules move in to take the place of the hotter, less dense molecules which have moved away. This cycle continues over and over until a "convection current" is made. This current type is only applicable in liquids and gasses because their molecules are free to move around individually.<br>  <br>  There are two subcategories for CONVECTION; "molecular vibration" and "free electron diffusion". Convection currents apply to only solid substances. As the substance is heated, because the molecules of the substance are stuck in the state they are in and cannot move around, they start to vibrate eventually vibrating vigorously enough to cause their neighboring molecules to move. This carries on in a chain reaction all the way throughout the solid substance (molecular vibration). Molecular vibration is a slow process. <br>  <br>  For substances with more free electrons, such as metals, free electrons can be passed down the metal towards the cooler end of the solid substance, and in doing so also pass along energy. This is what causes a heated metal to heat up so fast and uniformly throughout the metal object.
AA10259042	The barred tail certainly does indicate that it might be a Sparrowhawk.  They are rather small only about 12 inches long.  I believe that it is a juvenile.  That is probably why you can not find a picture exactly like it.  The adults have a gray back with the white splotching. Also notice the yellow-orange eye.  That is also indicative of a Sparrowhawk. <br>  <br>  The other possibility is a Northern Goshawk.  They look very similar but are much larger, about 16 inches vs 12 inches.  Without a scale reference in the photo, it is difficult for me to determine which it really might be.  A good reference would be the width of the ledge the bird is sitting on.  If the ledge is about 8 inches wide then the bird would be a Sparrowhawk.  If the ledge is 12 inches wide then the bird would be a Goshawk. (I think)|`|mRG0W5Yxaa	I'd put my money on Sparrowhawk.

R3E8DkTfaa	On the surface this would seem like a tough question to answer with absolute certainty. But when you consider the facts about each of the thermic types mentioned and those about roundworms it is pretty straight forward.  Without a doubt roundworms are not homeothermic.  This requires that they are actively controling there body temperatures by metabolic means.  Their temperature would remain the same regardless of what the temperature of the surrounding environment was. You and I are examples of homeothermic organisms.  The difference between ectothermic and poikilothermic is less dramitic.  An ectothermic organism is completely dependant upon the environment for it's body temperature.  Poikilothermic organisims have ways of regulating their temperature that are non metabolic.  They employ things such as gigantothermy or heat exchangers.  In gigantothermy the mass of the animal in relation to the surface area allows them to hold enough heat that they have a slightly higher temperature than their surroundings. An example is the great white shark.  Some large fish use heat exchangers to keep their muscles warmer than their other tissues allowing them to swim faster in cold water, example Tuna.   The classic example of an ectomtherm is something like a snake that relies on the warmth of the sun to bring its body temperature up.  They don't have enough mass to regulate their body temperature and they don't have enough mitochondria to self regulate with metabolism.  <br>  <br>  I think you can safely say that roundworms are ectothemic for the following reasons.  Since all roundworms are parasitic in nature, they have a stable environment in which they live.  They don't need to  regulate their body temperature because it is done for them.  Their  mass isn't great enough to require a heat exchanger to warm their internal parts.  Nor are they large enough to be gigantothermic.  Roundworms are true ecototherms.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	This question has much more to do with latin than it does with biology. What the question is asking is whether roundworms are cold blooded. What this means is whether they can generate their own body temperature like a mammal or rely on external heat like reptiles do. <br>  <br>  "Homeo" = "the same"<br>  "Thermic" = "temperature"<br>  <br>  Warm blooded animals always are exactly the same temperature (alive), so roundworms don't classify as homeotherms.<br>  <br>  "Ecto" = "outside"<br>  <br>  Ectotherms are the same temperature as the outside (of their bodies). In short, "cold blooded". Roundworms (and 99 % of all other life on earth) is cold blooded, so roundworms are ectotherms.<br>  <br>  "poikilothermic" is a thoroughly academic term and I'm guessing it probably means "somewhere in between". Many reptiles and even some fish are able to generate body heat by flexing their muscles. It gives them the heat they require for short bursts of fast movement. The great white shark is such a creature. Bees and moths also use this maneuver to power up before flight.

The fungi are heterotrophic organisms possessing a chitinous cell wall, with the majority of fungal species growing as multicellular filaments called hyphae forming a mycelium; some fungal species also grow as single cells. Sexual and asexual reproduction of the fungi is commonly via spores, often produced on specialized structures or in fruiting bodies. Some species have lost the ability to form reproductive structures, and propagate solely by vegetative growth. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are examples of fungi. The fungi are more closely related to animals than plants, yet the discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi, known as mycology, often falls under a branch of botany.<br>  <br>  Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter, and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi. They perform an essential role in all ecosystems in decomposing organic matter and are indispensable in nutrient cycling and exchange. Some fungi become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or molds. Many fungal species have long been used as a direct source of food, such as mushrooms and truffles and in fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. More recently, fungi are being used as sources for antibiotics used in medicine and various enzymes, such as cellulases, pectinases, and proteases, important for industrial use or as active ingredients of detergents. Many fungi produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides that are toxic to animals including humans. Some fungi are used recreationally or in traditional ceremonies as a source of psychotropic compounds. Several species of the fungi are significant pathogens of humans and other animals, and losses due to diseases of crops (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage caused by fungi can have a large impact on human food supply and local economies.<br>  <br>  To read more about Fungi, use this link : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi</a><br>  <br>  As for you question about eating 'it' ('fungi' by the way, is a plural, the singular of fungi is fungus) you can EAT some types of fungi, mushrooms, for example are a type of fungus but some are very dangerous. NEVER eat a fungus or mushroom from the wild.|`|bmsq005uaa	Fungi is a general term for any spore producing, saphorytic life, such as mushrooms.  It is the same kind of term as "animal" or "plant".<br>  Most fungi can be eaten.

PFTB5Yt7aa	The best answer if you want to link your creature to evolution is to say that "Many millions of years ago, my creature was once a climbing reptile. It used to be very short and it fell off of the trees too easily. Over the years a tail formed from its back because the longer my creature became the easier it was for it to balance on thin branches. As even more time passed the reptile, which was covered with scales, grew feathers and wings. This is due to the fact that over millions of years, the scales on the arms and legs started to grow out from the body to help it glide from branch to branch. As the scales grew longer they started to "fan out" into a basic feather. So what once was scales and arms, now is feathers and wings. <br>  <br>  P.S. (You don't have to use my idea, but try to expand off of it).|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Whoa.<br>  You'll notice that no extant fruit-eating forest fliers have both a long tail and wings.

CCeRdaoLaa	The argument I usually hear is "what use is half an eye?"  Of course, it brings to mind images of 50% of an eye, split halfway down the middle (which would, of course, be useless).<br>  <br>  When you actually look at the makeup of the eye, it becomes easier to see how the individual parts can function on their own.  Start with a simple eyespot - a photoreceptive outgrowth of the nervous system.  It doesn't even have to be complicated or have dedicated parts of the brain to interpret the information (just simple reactions, like "towards light" and "away from shadow").<br>  <br>  Then you take that photoreceptor, and start building up tissue around it in a cup shape.  That cup would further protect the eyespot and allow more light to be funneled in, permitting further retinal development (and parallel brain development).  If you continue this over many steps, you end up with a nearly-enclosed eye.<br>  <br>  This nearly-enclosed eye would be a huge advantage.  It would be protected and it could be aimed around (the retina, at this point, would be developed enough to form crude images).  It would allow for a huge jump in eye development - a lens.  The lens itself wouldn't be all that important at this point.  All that is needed is a small hole, and the laws of optics would allow a clear, focused image (on the same principles as a pinhole camera) - the modern nautilus still uses this method.<br>  <br>  From here, the retina and brain would develop even further to take full advantage of the image clarity.  Then, it would simply be a matter of refining the whole setup: clear connective tissue to form a cornea to protect the eye, a modified cornea to serve as a lens, muscles to move that lens and allow for focusing.<br>  <br>  So far, not one single example of irreducible complexity has been found.  Many have been proposed, but each one has been shown to be reducible upon further study.  The only way the argument holds up is for one to ignore the reliable, clear, and concise evidence.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Creationists claim that the eye is so complex, it could never have evolved from something so simple as a few light-sensitive cells.  Those that know big words say that, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, nothing can go from "simple" to "complex" without intelligent design of some sort, since the Second Law states that, over time, entropy increases;  that is, things break down from complex to simple.<br>  <br>  The response is that, while the Second Law of Thermodynamics is true, it is true only in CLOSED SYSTEMS, which living things are not.  As long  as energy can enter a system, it is not a closed system, and the Second Law does not hold;  entropy CAN decrease in an open system.<br>  <br>  If the eye were designed as some Godly creation, why was it designed to develop myopia, presbyopia, or hyperopia?  Why was it designed  a retina that could be detached from the choroid beneath it? Why was it designed to degenerate as we got older?|`|WPPIaLORaa	The creationists use the idea of irreducible complexity to make the argument that certain biological features could not have evolved.  However, every example they use to support intelligent design eventually turns out to have been built naturally of parts that may have had different purposes.<br>  <br>  The scientific evidence is that vision has evolved independently multiple times using different mechanisms to take advantage of light.  The fundamental point is that the eye did not start de novo, but it evolved from parts that served different purposes.  Furthermore, a close study of the embryology of the eye shows that the process is quite natural and no intelligent design is needed.<br>  <br>  Another point is that vision has its imperfections.  I wear glasses to correct  the imperfect geometry of my eyes.  If there were intelligent design needed for the eye, what untalented designer created problems with the eyes.  An intelligent design of the eye would not have allowed for near or far sighted vision, astigmatism, retinal detachments, congenital blindness, color blindness, and all of the other problems with the eye.<br>  <br>  It would serve the creationists better if they would provide the physical evidence for the existence of a creator first.  Let's call him Duane to distinguish him from any particular deity.  Once the physical existence of Duane is established, then one could ask if there is overwhelming physical evidence that Duane designed the eye.  However, to conclude from the anatomy of the eye that Duane exists is a massive stretch of the imagination.|`|031f2b5c50a8adb5d60eebe4f92a1a91aa	I can't speak necessarily to Dawkins' answer, but I've heard the response for instance that the eye is a perfectly explainable evolutionary product all the way up from light-attracting chemicals in plants (e.g. chlorophyll).  <br>  <br>  Moreover, the creationist suggestion that eyes are proof of the divine loses some steam when you consider the enormous number of people who require glasses to see properly.  An organ whose supposed perfection is such that its very existence demands the existence of an all-knowing creator surely does not square with the reality of poor vision we all know.|`|sXZWQRGdaa	The "eye is too complex" argument got started from a misquote from Origin of Species.  Darwin, playing devil's advocate, said that it is hard to imagine how something so complex as the human eye could evolve, but then went on to explain how it makes perfect sense.  This quote was, as far as I can tell, first misquoted by Scott Huse in his book "The Collapse of Evolution".<br>  <br>  "To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree."   <br>  <br>  This is where creationists like Scott Huse usually end quote. However, the rest of the quote is as follows:<br>  <br>  "Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound."<br>  <br>  The vast majority of the creationist arguments against evolution is based on flat out deception.|`|ekWmdorHaa	omg just accept that there could be god cos for some things, thats the only explanation. how the f... could something as complex asthe eye be a coincidence that just happens to be controlled and used perfectly by an organisms brain. oh and i suppose its just coincidence that our movements are controlled by what our eyes sea which enables a species to survive!!!

O0pb1F3gaa	Collision of India with the Asian mainland during the earliest Eocene (~50 Ma) has resulted in the growth of the world's largest orogenic belt, the Himalayas, and the associated Tibetan plateau. The seimotectonic tectonic evolution of China is characterized by the merger of several microcontinents throughout the entire Phanerozoic (Zhang et al., 1984; Hendrix and Davis, 2001). The collision and associated convergence and extension has created 64 major tectonic zones in China, which can be subdivided into a smaller number of tectonic "regions" (Zhang et al.,1984; Yin and Nie,1996).<br>  <br>  <br>  Thus, China is located in one of the most active seismic regions of the world that has been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history. The most significant of the historical earthquakes, in terms of lives lost, was that which occurred in 1556. However, since 1900 China has experienced several more destructive earthquakes. The most destructive earthquakes of the 20th Century were those of 1927 in Tsinghai, of 1932 in Gansu, of 1933 in Sichuan, of 1969 in Bohai Sea, of 1970 in Tonghai (Yunnan), of 1974 in Zhaotong (Yunnan), of 1975 in Haicheng, and of 1976 in Tangshan (Hebei Province) . The more recent earthquake of May 12, 2008 in Sichuan Province was the latest of the more destructive earthquakes that have struck China in the new millennium. The following is a brief account of the 1556 event and of some of the more destructive earthquakes since 1900<br>  The worse natural disaster in recorded history - at least in terms of lives lost - was caused by an earthquake in Hausien, in the Shaanxi Province of China in the morning of 23 January 1556. In Chinese historical record, this event is often referred as the "Jiajing Great Earthquake" because it occurred during the reign of Emperor Jiajing of the Ming dynasty. The "Shaanxi Earthquake" as it became later known, had an estimated magnitude ranging from 8.0 to 8.3 on the Richter scale (final assigned Moment Magnitude of 8), and had an estimated intensity of XI on the Modified Mercalli scale. Its epicenter was near Mount Hua in Shaanxi, close to present day Weinan city. The earthquake was responsible for the devastation of 98 counties and eight provinces in Central China, but particularly destructive in the Province of Shaanxi. The destruction extended over an area of 500 miles. In some of the counties, the average death toll was estimated to be about 60 percent of the population. According to historical records, a total of 830,000 people lost their lives, most from the collapse of poorly constructed houses and of Loess cave dwellings Destructive Earthquakes in China in the 20th Century in relation to the most recent earthquake of May 12, 2008 (modified graphic of Western Australia Un.)<br>  <br>  <br>  The Haicheng Earthquake of February 4, 1975<br>  <br>  <br>  On February 4, 1975, Haicheng, a town with about 100,000 inhabitants in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, was struck by a 7.3 magnitude earthquake. As early as 1970, the State Seismological Bureau, had identified the Liaoning Province as an area of high earthquake risk. Six months before the earthquake, there had been a series of smaller quakes in the region - which intensified on February 3rd. <br>  <br>  Based on studies of such precursor events and on unusual behavior exhibited by animals, a warning was issued by local authorities on February 3rd and in the early morning of February 4th.Thus, when the earthquake struck at 7:36 p.m. that evening of February 4, there were few lives lost as most inhabitants had evacuated to safer places. The death toll was relatively smaller than what could have been without the warning. Only 1,328 people lost their lives. However property damage was high. <br>  <br>  No other earthquake in this century has been as catastrophic or has claimed as many lives as the earthquake that struck the city of Tangshan in Northern China on July 28, 1976 (27 July 1976 local date). Tangshan, a thriving industrial city with one million inhabitants, is located in the Province of Hebei, about 95 miles east and slightly south of Beijing and about 280 miles southwest of Haicheng - where in the previous year another very destructive earthquake had occurred. Although the region had experienced moderate seismic activity in the past, there were no foreshocks this time, and no warning.<br>  <br>  China's Seismic Zones<br>  <br>  Collision of India with the Asian mainland during the earliest Eocene (~50 Ma) has resulted in the growth of the world's largest orogenic belt, the Himalayas, and the associated Tibetan plateau.
