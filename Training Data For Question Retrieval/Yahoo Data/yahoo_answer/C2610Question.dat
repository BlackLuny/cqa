20080928174910AASWifI	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	What's happening with this 2002 PT Cruiser?	We've had the car for about a year now, and haven't had too many problems. Most of the problems were things that the dealership failed to check or fix when it was in their possession.      I drove the car instead of my Ford Cobra to save gas, this being the first time since I got my license that I have driven it. I first noticed it when I was driving down my driveway. I put it in neutral and shut it off like my mom does any time I'm riding with her, however, I noticed a big problem.      The car was still running, but quickly died. So I started it and continued down the road. After a few stops, we stopped at a local Food-Lion and I turned the key back to the off position. It kept running, even sputtering like it was about to die.      But it continued to run, and even revved up on its own! It didn't rev high, but it still did on its own. It would even respond to depressing the gas pedal, which shocked me. So what's wrong?

I managed to get most of my car out of the way but she hit the front drivers side fender.  I have managed to pull the fender out, but I don't know if I have a broken axle.  My steering wheel center is vertical instead of horizontal now.  My passenger front wheel is no longer completely vertical, but it is only off by a few degrees.  When I tried to drive the car the steering was much softer and not as responsive.  The more I drove it the more noise it made, kinda like squealing tires or a bad fan belt.  I need to know if I should start to look for a new car.

20081107223642AAFuabC	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Is it uncool for me to be a cautious motorcycle rider?	I am 20 years old I almost got my M1 license, and I honestly don't know any stunts not even the simple wheely. ANd just for thought about doing  stunts scares me. I look at it this way; its already alot of risk involving riding a motorcycle, but then if you start doing stunts you're just asking for a death wish. But yet again I don't want to lose my respect, what if my friends in college see me riding my bike and tell me to do wheellie it will look cool just do it, and I don't know how to wheelie and don't get any thrill out of it. So if I nod my head they would just laugh at me and call me pussy. So either I do a wheelie or lose respect? I honestly don't understand how some people get a thrill of playing with death? it must be stupidity and adrenaline that gives them the high. When I get my M1 I want to be a cautious and defensive driver. So basically most of society think your a bad *** if you do stunts and if you're careful you're a pussy. WTF is wrong with todays society?

20090309195940AAyUN5j	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;BMW	Traffic Police BMW M5 on the M5 Entrapment?	A rumour has got back to me about an unmarked police car, which is a gold BMW 5 series probably an M5, operating between Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, possibly on the M5 motorway.      Apparently what they're doing is coming up close behind sports cars, and if they react by putting their foot down, they then put the blue light on and pull them over for speeding.      Would they do this?  If so is this entrapment?        In all fairness, if I have someone driving too close, I slow down, and will slow down to a painfully slow pace to make a point, and usually that works.        But that's potentially fatal on the motorway, especially if your in the outside lane, and there isn't space in the middle lane to pull over.

I have already planned on utilizing 2, 10cu ft deep freezes and hauling them and all the other donated items in the charities enclosed trailer and pulling it with my pickup truck but I am unsure how to power the freezers.   I want to use an inverter but don't know how big an inverter I will need, since my truck is a Dodge diesel I am pretty sure my electrical system can power a large inverter.   If I do use an inverter is there a sequence to powering up the equipment i am running?   Does the inverter use the truck batteries to run or the alternator?   Are there any precautions I need to watch out for?   My other option is a gas generator but I don't like this idea.      Remember all this is for a charity and everything has been donated that can be. I am providing the truck, transportation and the fuel and I guess once I know what size inverter I will either buy one or borrow it if we can find someone with one.      I would like to go ahead and thank you all for the excellent answers I know I am going to get.   God bless you all!!

The actual truck's front end doesn't shake, but a noise that hums and vibrates resonates through the front of the truck and to the middle (about under the seats) I don't know if it comes from the front to mid, or starts from the mid and goes to the front. i've had my brakes, balljoints, and outer tie rod ends replaced recently, so i doubt its those. I've been told a/c clutch and tranny. As i've also said, it is louder when the a/c is on, so i don't know what effect that would have on the transmission. It also seems to happen more when the truck is cold, then the noise gets a little quieter. PLEASE, IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT IT COULD BE, I'M TIRED OF IT.

20071011212946AAwfAmM	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car Keyless Entry can lock but cannot unlock?	A friend borrowed my car and I think he might have unknowingly changed the settings of the keyless entry system when trying to figure out the remote. I have a Autostart brand remote car starter with keyless entry. The remote starter still works fine as far as I can tell. The keyless entry system is hooked up to an actuator that moves the driver side lock. Right now, the doors can be locked with the remote, but cannot be unlocked with the remote. The door also immediately locks itself again after I unlock it manually with the key. I suspect the system may be in a "locked-down" mode and a simple combination of buttons can disable it. Any suggestions I can get on this problem will be much appreciated. Thanks!

20090309124822AAd5uf6	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Car Accident - No police report - Ins info exchanged?	Over the weekend I was involved in a very minor accident. I rear-ended a vehicle. We exited the vehicles and looked over the damage. I had NO damage to my vehicle, however there was a small chip of paint missing from the bumper of the vehicle I rear-ended. We exchanged contact info and insurance info, however no police report was filed, in fact the police were never called to the scene. Today I received an email from the other party stating that she was going to need to have her bumper replaced. I called the body shop she went to and requested a copy of the estimate for my review. The problem I have is that there was already damage to this bumper from a previous accident, which I was not involved in and which was admitted by this person as a previous accident. I feel like I'm being pressured to pay for a new bumper when in all actuality it was only a bit of paint missing. She said that the bumper was cracked through the plastic so it needed to be replaced. How do I know or does she know this wasn't cause from an earlier accident? I have not informed my insurance company at this time, as I do not want to involve them and have my premium go up. I was willing to pay out of pocket and settle without insurance, but that was before I knew the entire bumper would be getting replaced? If I just don't respond to the email or choose to respond and say I don't feel I should be responsible for a new bumper when it may have been from an earlier accident what can happen? I've not admitted any fault written, she did have a witness (boyfriend) with her, but again there was no report. Help!?

The other day i drove home from work down the high way and the service engine light comes on. Later on that night as i started the engine again the SMG light turns on and it wont let me started with 1st gear instead it only starts with 2nd gear. Plus it wont allow me to chang gears to any of the other gears. Then as i paddle the gas on 2nd gear and when the RPM goes up and reaches around 5-6 and speed went up then thats when the gear changes to 5th gear but it skip 3rd and 4th gear. As soon as it hit 5th gear then thats when it lets me change gears again.

From my understanding at that time I needed 2 things in order to get a permit: completed a drivers ed course, AND completed a drivers training course (behind the wheel training). Well I completed the drivers ed course and got the certificate for it. But I never took drivers training because it was too expensive (like $200). So now I've been looking at the requirements again & everything I read says I just need to have completed a drivers ed course and then I can get my permit? If this is true then this is great cus now I can get my permit :]. So can someone please officially clarify this for me? Thank you sooo much in advance.

It worked fine til today when I was at the store. I got in the car and it wouldn't turn over to start. It would start, then die just as fast. It wouldn't stay on. Anyways, I had it towed home and had some guys look at it. They said they thought maybe it was our fuel pump and that it wasn't pumping enough gas into the engine to turn over and that we may need a new one. First of all, what could have happened and how much do fuel pumps approximately cost for '96 Pontiac Grand Am's?

Help Please!!?	.Was cruising along the freeway nicely yesterday, going about 70 mph, when suddenly my vehicle slowed down and would not accelerate when I stepped on the gas pedal. Engine did not stall and I was able to putter along the shoulder of the highway at 5 to 10 mph but would not speed up when I tried to accelerate. Twice, I let it sit for ten minutes and started out again but each time vehicle seemed to be accelerating properly for about 30 seconds but then the same problem would reoccur. I finally had to be towed 200 miles home.      Today, strangely, the mechanic test drove it on the highway for fifteen minutes and it ran fine. My fear is that if I don't find the cause of the problem it could happen again.      My vehicle is a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup. 350 V8 engine.

20090309220236AAMHyzb	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What would be a good choice for a sporty, fun car at 17?	I have been looking to buy a car for a while now, and i have a few things in mind. Im pretty interested in cars now and i want something thats alot of fun to drive but doesnt really cost too much money, and nothing thats going to be ridiculous on insurance. Im not really sure if i want to get a loan yet (not that i could get my own anyway, i would need my parents to get me one) but im really considering everything.      I have looked at a few cars, just to give you an idea of what kind of car im going for, maybe it would help with suggestions.      I first looked at getting a loan for a WRX impreza, preferably a little bit older one. I got a quote for insurance on that, even signing with my parents its around 350-400 a month, dont want to pay that, even though this would be my number one choice for a car      After that i thought i would just get an older sports car, and i have also looked at the Toyota Supra, an MKIII from 87-92. This is much much cheaper on insurance considering the year of the car, and still seems like it would be a really fun car to drive      A few others would be a 94-99 Mitsubishi Eclipse, or an 00-05 Golf GTI, both of which are significantly cheaper on insurance and total cost than a WRX      Thats just to kind of give an idea the type of car im looking into, any suggestions on other cars possibly? i dont need a car with a turbo, or anything super fast like a WRX, but i want something that has a tighter suspension, something in the 160-200 HP range, that is just fun to drive      Please dont tell me to go throw a grand at a much older economical car, even though many might think i dont need a sporty car at 17 (which i dont) it is what i really want, i have been driving a 96 Subaru Outback and its such a great car, but im just wanting something more a bit more fun to drive.      Oh and also, i dont know much about cars yet but i want to learn much more, which is kind of why i want to get a little bit older car like the Supra and learn how to do my own work on it.      So, any suggestions/thoughts as far as cars go?   Thanks a lot, all answers appreciated   Ivan

Well, last saturday i was on a gravel rd and i peeled out and gravel kicked up and about 5-10 minutes later, i notice the temp gauge was all the way hot. I have changed the thermostat, blead the line, and refilled the coolant and the car gets hot is only about 1 minute. It literally goes from off and cool to all the way hot in about 60-90 seconds. Also, although the temp gauge is all the way hot, the radiator cap, plastic resovoir, no hoses, or the engine is hot.

I don't believe they are blown because I never really have it loud enough to where I think they would blow. I'm not much of a fan of sony audio, but the car came with it so no complaints. I'm trying to figure out what's wrong so I can decide whether or not to get new subs. The amp is a 1200 watt xplod and it seems to be powering on fine. Both of the fuses also look fine. I checked all of the wiring and that seems to not be a problem, but I'm worried it is. I noticed the sub not working after I had vacuumed the car which involved me moving the subs around a bit and I think there may have been a problem there. Can anyone think of where something may be wrong that I haven't checked already or anything I should double check or where the wiring may have gone wrong that I have checked? Also if I can't find a solution should I take it to an audio repair shop or just plan on buying new subs?

20090309230837AA94NBh	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Possible ways to unseize an engine?	My nephew has a 1990 something chevy S-10 blazer.  The oil plug fell out and naturally after he ran it long it got hot.  He shut it off not knowing what it was ( he's 17 and mechanically challenged). When he went to start it, the engine was seized.  Many people have said to spray oil into the cylinders, others say put trans fluid in the crankcase, and try turning the engine with a wrench on the balancer bolt (crankshaft)  Will any of these methods unlock the engine?  I know bearings are probably burnt ETC. but its easier to work on the engine with the motor turning. Any help will be appreciated if you have a tricks or a tips. ThanX

20090309231714AAUP3Mw	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Car Insurance rep presented low-ball offer. How do I fight back?	Ok here is what is going on. I have a 1990 vw vanagon that I own for since 1999. My tire split on the interstate and lost control of the vw and went upside down. I have full coverage plus I pay extra to the insurance company for my life time paint job and a body kit that I put on my van back in 2002. The insurance people are going to total the vw out and they also tells me that extra money I pay them works differently when totaling out the van. I have the receipt of the cost of the paint job ($3,408 dollars) but do not have the receipt for the body kit and the company went out of business. But I do  have the web site where that company bought the body kit from which the cost of the whole kit was 1,113.05 EUR = 1,401 US dollars and thats before shipping. Well anyways the insurance company only offered me $3,853. I feel I am getting ripped. Please tell me what you think.
