20070215083001AAduKU1	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What's the MINIMUM amount of money YOU would need in the bank to be wealthy?	And by WEALTHY, I mean having enough interest money coming in every month to meet the expenses of your chosen lifestyle.  Work would be optional.  Your mimimum amount would not be invested.  It would be in banks (with emphasis on plural) in CDs where your principal is protected by FDIC insurance, and earning an assumed low average of only 4% per year return.      People have differing needs when it comes to lifestyles.  What will be acceptable to one might not cut it for another.  So, you have to give some thought to identifying what lifestyle would be acceptable to you and what it would cost you to live that way.  For example, a minimum for me might be a beach bum sort of life style, but with a roof over my head (maybe an efficiency apartment) and a vehicle (maybe a VW beetle) to drive around in (visiting different beaches).          So, are you eager to figure out what your minimum is, and how long it will take you to save it?  Happiness might be available to you sooner than you think.

So TurboTax online tells me I can get my entire $69 dollars back from the state of NJ... however they'd charge me about $30 to file with them. So I decided to print out the forms and do it myself... as I was printing out the forms and filling out all the boxes, I realized that I was being taxed $51 on my income, so therfore I'm only getting $18.69 back. Am I doing something wrong when I'm filling it out myself? Or am I exempt from state tax? I'm really confused. Who is right? Turbotax, or me?

I meet with my staff of 7 and asked all of them to monitor their break time better, especially time spent in the break room, that it had been reported to me that some staff were spending a lot of time in the break room, and I had also noticed it (all true). It was simple "reeling in" so to speak. Directed at the group in general.      One of the employees in the meeting got upset, started attacking some of the other employees for their behavior. I tried to step in a handle it the best I could, I acknowledge I didn't do everything perfectly, I am still a new manager. I ended the meeting as soon as I could, informed my boss of what happened.       Next day the upset employee accused me of age discrimination and said she was going to tender her resignation. My boss and the director of our EEO office both say there was no discrimination. The employee may or may not resign. I doubt she will.       If she doesn't how do I work with her now? How do I pretend that nothing happened knowing that any move I make can be seen as age discrimination?       One of the employees complaints is that I spend more time talking to the younger employees than the older ones (I don't), but now that I've been accused of this how do I have casual conversation with someone who accuses me of age discrimination?       Do I have any recourse against someone saying this about me, Same things been done to 2 previous supervisors and HR acknowledges there's a problem, Just what do I do about it?

Money markets are markets for            Foreign currencies.            Consumer automobile loans.            Corporate stocks.            Long-term bonds.            Short-term debt securities such a Treasury bills.          2. Which of the following statements is CORRECT?              The most important difference between spot markets versus futures markets is the maturity of the instruments that are traded.  Spot market transactions involve securities that have maturities of less than one year whereas futures markets transactions involve securities with maturities greater than one year.                    Capital market transactions involve only preferred stock or common stock.                    If General Electric were to issue new stock this year, it would be considered a secondary market transaction since the company already has stock outstanding.                    Both Nasdaq dealers and “specialists” on the NYSE hold inventories of stocks.                    Money market transactions do not involve securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.         3.  If the stock market is semistrong-form efficient, which of the following statements would be CORRECT?        The required returns on all stocks are the same, and the required returns on stocks are higher than the required returns on bonds.                    The required returns on stocks equal the required returns on bonds.                 A trading strategy in which you buy stocks that have recently fallen in price is likely to provide you with a return that exceeds the return on the overall stock market.                    If you have insider information about a particular stock, you cannot expect to earn an above average return on this information because it is already incorporated into the current stock price.                    Even if a market is semistrong-form efficient, an investor could still earn a better return than the market return if he or she had inside information.         4.    Suppose 1-year T-bills currently yield 5.00% and the future inflation rate is expected to be constant at 3.10% per year.  What is the real risk-free rate of return, r*?   Disregard cross-product terms, i.e., if averaging is required, use the arithmetic average.               1.90%                    2.00%                    2.10%                 2.20%               2.30%               5.    Suppose the real risk-free rate is 3.50%, the average future inflation rate is 2.25%, and a maturity premium of 0.10% per year to maturity applies, i.e., MRP = 0.10%(t), where t is the years to maturity.  What rate of return would you expect on a 5-year Treasury security, assuming the pure expectations theory is NOT valid?   Disregard cross-product terms, i.e., if averaging is required, use the arithmetic average.                 5.95%                    6.05%                    6.15%                    6.25%                    6.35%               6.    Which of the following would be most likely to lead to a higher level of interest rates in the economy?                 Households start saving a larger percentage of their income.                    Corporations step up their expansion plans and thus increase their demand for capital.                    The level of inflation begins to decline.                    The economy moves from a boom to a recession.                    The Federal Reserve decides to try to stimulate the economy.               7.    Assume that interest rates on 20-year Treasury and corporate bonds are as follows:      T-bond = 7.72%        A   =  9.64%      AAA    = 8.72%        BBB = 10.18%      The differences in rates among these issues were caused primarily by                 Tax effects.                    Default risk differences.                    Maturity risk differences.                    Inflation differences.                 Real risk-free rate differences

20090222130757AAOcYDM	Business & Finance;Small Business	I have some questions about Mary Kay?	Hi, I am a new Mary Kay Beauty Consultant, and I am soooo exited about my decision. It took about 1 week to make up my mind even after reading all the negative blah, blah, blah online I have decided to take the plunge! Yippee!  I'm just so exited. I had a few questions about success when you first start. I was wondering what some  beauty consultants where doing to get there business up and running on a budget? How do you start with no inventory? Can you just order for your customers, and have it shipped to them? What's the pros, and cons of having inventory on hand, and making such a huge up front investment? I really could not afford the start up kit fee which was 100.19, but I figured it would be worth the gamble considering I'm jumping in with both feet. Thank you for your responses.

In the same contract say that you don′t gonna receive money from the first 150 thousand books selled, and they give you it like a prize, and you had to pay for it label, casuse is not considered has copyright, like if was the loto or something like that.

Also I saw, trying to discover something, the contract for the publicity system of google, Adsense, and they divide you in three categories: American company, foreing company with employeds in the US and people who don’t “touch anything” in the US, And I –against- can find me there.

The HDI combines three basic dimensions:          * Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity       * Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).       * Standard of living, as measured by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) in United States dollars.

I've been there for over a month now. He ALSO isn't paying ANY of my taxes because he considers me a free lancer for the company...which is fine...except he also has me being his assistant now who calls people and sets up appointments along with designing...      I told him before that maybe I could just work from home and he can pay me per job (he keeps whining about my hourly pay amount). He liked the idea of paying me per job but not working from home because he needs an assistant. He said he'd only consider me an employee and pay my taxes if I was willing to take a GIANT pay cut because then he's paying for that....which doesn't seem fair..

I don't get paid to be on call and yet it's expected.  I also don't charge for my time when my boss calls nor do I get reimbursed for my phone although I am dead in the water without it.  Am I being taken advantage of and should I go back to using my company phone and tell them to pound salt when I can't check my email or take pictures on it?

My older brother (28) wanted to purchase a car, but he has bad credit, so my mom cosigned for my brother's car. He's making all the payments. But before she cosigned for his car, she called her agent to find out if she was able to be the cosigner of the car, just because we are considered a low income family. They said it was fine.      Now I want to purchase a car(I'm 19/finance the car), and my mom wants to cosign, but she doesn't know if she would be able to, since we have health care.   She's calling the healthcare representative this week to find out if she can be the cosigner of my car. I'm going to be making the payments for the car and insurance.      My question is.. would she be able to be the cosigner of a car I want to purchase? She's already the cosigner of my brother, and soon to be me, but we don't know if we are allowed to.

20090222132846AAnT9vV	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Rights concerning internet purchase?	On Christmas eve 2008 I bought and downloaded Power DVD8 Ultra from Cyberlinks website.  I was very excited to be trying out blu ray on my new PC.  I installed the package, put in the disc and watched  through the adverts.  Then after the adverts had finised the programme crashed - didn't even get to the title screen.      I tried everything I could think of, and eventually contacted Cyberlink through their support section of their website.    The response I got was a rather bland, standard message, the content of which suggested that they hadn't even read what I had written.  I gave them the answers they asked, including the diagnostic 'is your computer ready for Blu ray' thing (why would I have been trying to run blu ray if my computer wasn't set up for it??) and waited for an answer.      several days later, another message from them asking for more info about my comupter, which I gave them .  They seemingly only answered me after this because I had to prompt them to do so.      To cut a VERY long story short, this is still going on over 2 months after the date of purchase.  They have not been able to offer me a solution that makes the product work.  I have now asked for my money back, and they seem VERY reluctant to let me have it!  I sent my request to the link they sent me.  They told me that their policy states that refunds can be given 30 days after the date of purchase!  This hardly seems good enough as it is their fault it's taken this long, and it's not my fault their product does not work!      My latest message from them said that as it was over 30 days since my purchase I should follow this link  http://www.cyberlink.com/english/cs/supp...       As you can see, this tells me nothing that is any help.      I know in the UK that they are in breech of trading laws.  However, as they are on the iternet, I am unsure what I can do.      All I wanted was for the product I bought to work.  And now I am ending up fighting a battle to get my money back as they have not been able to make their programme usable.      Can anyone advise me where I can turn to?  Does anyone know what my rights are concerning an internet purchase such as this?  And does anyone know how I can get my money back off of them?      Thanks   Susan
