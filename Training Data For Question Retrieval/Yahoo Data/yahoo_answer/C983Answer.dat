983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Hornswoggle vs Khali was pretty good :)<br>  <br>  In terms of a more serious match, Big Show vs Rey when Show strapped Rey to a stretcher and, contrary to the wishes of the WWE Creative, swung the stretcher like a baseball bat to hit Rey against the ringpost only for Rey to then fall right on his head because his arms were strapped down and he couldn't brace his fall. <br>  <br>  That was a good one :)|`|cwfu4cQUaa	Rey mysterio vs The Great Khali|`|AA12079388	Andre the GIANT Vs Hulk Hogan....|`|2enbuCQ6aa	khali vs rey or rey is big show|`|3icTrKLLaa	Shawn Michaels vs Diesel at IYH:Good Friends, Better Enemies<br>  <br>  He is a very talented wrestler, so hopefully his career with the WWE will go very far.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Rey and Khali.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bourne will go far if he can avoid injuring himself.
qF1oQG7Xaa	I would Agree with the Raw one!<br>  The SD one was kinda boring, the Champion coming out first and getting eliminated first, Kinda sucks really. Also, Kozlov and Big Show should've used their size advantages better but both got pinned by smaller stars! Also, it was unrealistic, How could HHH take 2 last rides but Taker couldn't take a Pedigree? Silly. Also, Undertaker hasn't had a title for a year, Triple H has won loads more and had one a few months back, it's Taker's turn I feel, not just the same old HHH again! The only real thing that made the elimination chamber better than a singles match was Jeff Hardy's Swanton of the cage.<br>  <br>  However, RAW's one got started right when Kofi got done by Edge, it made it exciting, then Rey came out and nearlly broke Edge's lil Chamber thing (Haha). Why Mike Knox was in it I dunno, but he didn't do badly anyway. Kane was a let down Kinda though, I hoped he do better. When Edge was into the match, Rey just took him out straight! Cena getting pinned soon after coming in made it get exciting, another new champion. Also, the Codebreaker, 619 and Spear Combo was a good way to have Cena eliminated! The RAW stars made better use of the cell, threw each other on it a lot, better than SD. Then Jericho got eliminated, then just Rey and Edge left - Also good because Rey was friends with Kofi, who Edge injured!<br>  Mysterio did some amazaing high flying moves, but Edge won with that single spear - The Crowd didn't know who was gonna win!<br>  The only thing that was bad in both was no one bled. Also, the whole Edge thing was a little silly, as Edge was in both (Yawn) and annoyed me, and it made it Kinda obvious who was going to win right from the start.<br>  <br>  *STARED*|`|A4hyDNH6aa	Smackdown, because Jeff Hardy eliminated Edge, then after he was eliminated from the chamber, the title was really up 4 grabs, even though it wasn't The Undertaker's time to win the Title just yet.|`|Ut7XQJ1Faa	I would say the smackdown elinination chamber coz tripe h won and teh match was great wiff him and the undertaker. I would usually say the raw elimination chamber but the whole edge winning thing was so stupid|`|W9f1QFcgaa	i would say the raw match, it would have been better if kofi had a chance, edge one fair and square, but kofi earned the place to be in that chamber match.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	obviously the smackdown elimination chamber|`|cwfu4cQUaa	Smackdown Elimanation chamber was the best|`|AA11237905	I Thought the smackdown one was better and i think vladamir kozlov will face big show.|`|XtZxAyZSaa	RAW 5*<br>  SMACKDOWN 4*|`|qNHMcRL4aa	Smackdown elimination chamber was better apart from the ending with hhh winning!!!!! I thought the pin on edge was awesome and the undertaker became an honorary hardy with the poetry in motion.<br>  <br>  Kane should have won the raw chamber!!!|`|94UNuQ4Faa	Yeah, the RAW one was the best.<br>  <br>  WQ: Kane?<br>  I starred!! =]]|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I would say the Smackdown Eliminatin Chamber with Triple H winning the WWE Championship. Edge should not have been allowed to enter the Raw Elimination Chamber Match. that spot should have gone to a Raw Wrestler, not a Smackdown Wrestler.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	yeah i agree the raw chamber with the twist as well as the finish between edge and rey mysterio were executed perfectly, it was also exciting to see mysterio do those moves in the chamber.<br>  <br>  The big show will face maybe vladmir kozlov|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	the smackdown one coz of hhh wining the wwe title, it should have been the undertaker but very good match|`|yvtGL6RTaa	smackdown...it had way more compitition .....by far...the raw EC was weak...but rey almost winning was kool....but o well
FlOTIfhbaa	you probably wont be over 6 foot dude...I'd say at a guard positon or small forward.|`|GswnLKtQaa	since you a shooter, play SG and play at the wing. your team can use your shooting skills from long and mid range.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	6'9 is quite a stretch buddy. Depends on your style of play. If you know the game well, shoot good 3s, decent jump shot, perhaps a shooting guard.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	You should play a SF.Great speed,good 3 point shooter,great mid range shot,great dunker and rebounder.You should play a SF,you have to many great things for that postion|`|SZzASlujaa	Well it's obvious that you'd make a good center. That's just my opinion though. Sounds like you have a nice couple of years ahead of you though. Good luck.|`|hmsCFQocaa	Develop your small-player game until you get to 6'2". You will be practicing most likely with older boys, and you'll need it.|`|4j92pzJxaa	u wont be 6'9 lmao.<br>  <br>  u will be 6'1 max|`|RLoilwCNaa	Stick with water boy.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	be left out.
GswnLKtQaa	try some of these vertical leap excersize:<br>  <br>  JUMPING EXERCISES<br>  <br>  Deep Knee Bends --- Be standing. Slowly bend at the knees while keeping your back straight. Slowly crouch down as low as possible (it shouldn't hurt) and slowly rise back up. Do this 15 times. Over time increase to 20, 30, etc. <br>  <br>  Deep Knee Bend Jumps --- Be standing. Crouch down as described above but fairly quickly, almost touching your bottom to the ground, then explode upwards as high as you can. The moment you land, immediately crouch and launch back up again. Do this 15 times, and when you can, increase to 20, 30, etc. <br>  <br>  Toe Raises --- Stand regularly, then raise up onto the tips of your toes. Lower back down. Don't just rock up and down, do it slowly (not too slowly) but steadily. Repeat 30-50 times. <br>  <br>  Toe-Raise with Weights --- If you have any sort of weights, holding/wearing them while doing these toe raises will help. Use small weights (a mere 5 or 10 pounds is fine) and work your way up. <br>  <br>  Stomach Crunches --- We believe that sit-ups are bad for your back. Stomach crunches, where while lying on your back, using your ab muscles and keeping your back straight, you rise up just enough to lift your shoulders off the ground, are better. Do them often - perhaps for 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night. <br>  <br>  Jumping Rope--- Jumping rope definitely helps your vertical leap. Jump rope while watching tv or something. Make it a habit.
F2mmYds1aa	the bulls and nba's best record was 72-10 in the mid 90's...<br>  the lakers are the ones who have 69-13 as there best...<br>  and kobe for mvp...<br>  screw lebron..|`|GswnLKtQaa	I think because Malone has better numbers and Jazz also won 60+|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Lebron will probably get the MVP.  Kobe's goal is the Championship ring; the MVP title is not even in his sights.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	no,LeBron will probably win it or Wade,not Kobe. even IF L.A. has the best record in the league because:<br>  MVP-Most Valuable PLAYER!!!!!!!!<br>  not most valuable team.<br>  its not what your team overall does that determines who is the best player in the league,its what your stats are that you,and you alone did.<br>  Your team has nothing to do with MVP awards. MVP-best player award.<br>  Best Team Award-Championship.<br>  Ex.LeBron James won Mvp and his team didn't have the best record,samefor your ex.with Malone. its about whoever has the best statistical records f|`|vFbzBo4eaa	We don't know but rings are more important for Kobe and his team,he heas done with the thing he wants rings.The MVP battle is between other players.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Winning the championship is more important for Kobe and the Lakers.
fWMzd7y5aa	Yea, all they care about is if they make money. They do not care if their players rot in a **** hole.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	The Warriors have a power struggle with their Pres of Basketball Ops. in Chris Mullin and their Head Coach in Don Nelson. Who wants more power trusted into him whether it being taking Mullin's job or becoming the GM. It is not a pretty situation and it can end, like it did for my Knicks when Pat Riley - our Head Coach had the same power struggle with our incompetent  owner in James Dolan and our incompetent Pres. of Basketball Ops at the time, Scott Layden. End result was that Riley left to the Heat, an expansion team back then where he was given the Head Coaching position as well as part owner and Pres. of Basketball Ops. Knicks ended up getting Jeff Van Gundy, so it was all good and the way Riley left created an intense Knicks-Heat rivalry for many years to come.<br>  <br>  If Nelson walks out maybe the Warriors can hire Avery Johnson. The very same guy who replaced Nelson in Dallas and took them to the Finals. Nelson had a better chance to take Dallas to the Finals, but because he does not believe in defense even though he had a stacked team in Nowitzki, Nash, Jamison, Walker, Howard, and Marquis Daniels they could not get further than WCF. Johnson is a defensive coach and took them to the Finals. Even, though Nelson beat Johnson w/ his Warriors in the playoffs. Johnson got the better of Nelson in the long run and could turn the Warriors around.<br>  <br>  Grizzlies have always been bad until they got Jerry West as a GM. They were very good for 3 straight years. Until, it went downhill from there. The franchise stopped listening to West and they traded away Posey, Williams, Wells and left Gasol alone w/ just Miller and Gay was still progressing. Clippers have pretty much always sucked cause their owner Donald Sterling does not like to spend any of his money.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They don't agree with some things in thier teams and the result is same in every season,is simple as that|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	yea it's the GM's and coaches cause the Clipps got Baron Davis,Eric Gordon,Al Thorton,Zach Randolph and more all of these 3 teams got tlent howver they dont know how to play as a team and dont know how to win
G3EOBdLEaa	Antonio Mcdyess refused to go to Denver so instead of voiding the trade they just bought out his contract.  It kind of sucks for us Nugget fans though because we could have really used McDyess off the bench.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	He din't fit in the team and the Psitons was the olny place for him so|`|LSXdwRDUaa	McDyes wanted to play for the pistons. He didnt like the Denver Nuggets<br>  So they waived him.|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	yeah cuz he didnt want to play there. he wated to play for detroit|`|2VVgxFDKaa	because they didnt want his contract
9kb6LcNPaa	Miami has way more people than Seattle.<br>  you're thinking of geographical size, not population size.<br>  <br>  and yes, everybody counts the metropolitan area, not just the city limits. in a lot of cities there are more people living in the suburbs than in the actual city nowadays.<br>  <br>  go by what the metropolitan area is.<br>  the amount of people that only live within the city limits is irrelevant.|`|fynRVMZAaa	I'm confused by your question. There are 2 mil. more people living in Miami than Seattle. Add Cleveland to Seattle and you still don't equal Miami's population. You know how I know this? I read your link!

RB9Y8p8Yaa	yes first the Grizzlies loose Gasol's huge contract second the Grizzlies get Marc Gasol, Pau's brother and Marc Gasol is young and looks talented and looks like he will have a great future with the Grizzlies|`|2VVgxFDKaa	yes it was because it freed them up in cap space and Gasol asked to be traded in the year before so he wasnt happy there anyways.  It will work out for Grizzlies in the future|`|LSXdwRDUaa	it was good for Lakers But not good for the Memphis. <br>  The only reason why lakers are good is because of Andrew Bynum and Pau gasol|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	No, it was a good deal for the Lakers though.|`|Jtt6SaVIaa	Getting rid of sour lemons is always a good option. They tend to spread venom throughout a team. He really was a bitter player.|`|GswnLKtQaa	come to think of it, the memphiz has a good future with the young players they have now. it was a good move by the griz.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No,Kwame Brown(former NBA player i think) and Javrious Crittenton were great players and Crittenton was a great player but he didn't fit good in the Grizless and they trade him and Kwame went out of the NBA i think.The lakers had great things from this trade,Gasol fit perfect and Kobe need big men to help him,Bynum,Gasol and Kobe.
2VVgxFDKaa	no not a 15million extension.  It would be about what Bynum got and that was for the first year it would be like 12 million.  And they dont want to spend that kind of money on David Lee.  I mean ya he is a good player but he isnt a future elite player in the league and he gets most of his points on hustle points so he is not really a guy that can create his own shot well|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	15 million Lee is a good player however his not worth 15 mill <br>  probably 7-9 mill however not 15
vFbzBo4eaa	I think so it's good trade system
TKDi70uTaa	its a possibility alright. its all very well saying we wont but we have been around the bottom all season long. unless there is a string of results over the next four weeks i fear for my team as i think their bottle will go if it comes down to the last 3-4 games.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Not me , it would be a shame if they went down , they are fun to sit next to at matches - unlike some fans . Seriously they won't go down , they will get by don't worry Spurs fans you will be Fine , enjoy the excitement|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	I reckon Spurs & Arsenal will be mid table soon - Spurs going up, Arsenal going down.|`|XU1KaWXwaa	i think spurs BEST team could just about beat Manu U18's|`|rfCGWFNcaa	yes the way they are going yes|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Only the haters..... I cant see it,,, As bad as Spurs are there are 5 or 6 teams that are just that much worse.. And we still have to play most of em!!  Why So interested in Spurs tonight?????

x9GODf8eaa	Sakic and Draper are almost identical.<br>  <br>  Both have a 1/2" curve, open face, rounded toe. The only real difference is the lie. Sakic is 5.5, Draper is 5. That means the Sakic blade has a slightly smaller angle from the shaft to blade. I doubt you would notice half a lie difference though.<br>  <br>  But yes, Draper is your best bet.|`|eW3St5H6aa	Go to a pro shop and look at some, thats the only way to really know if you like the curve or not.  Then if it's cheaper online you just go home and buy the same thing you just looked at.|`|HxqCHgOLaa	Draper is probably the closest.|`|axxQzOCHaa	<a href="http://www.hockeymonkey.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hockeymonkey.com</a> from there go to replacement blades, click on Warrior and look at videos of the Pro Stock blades whether if tapered or standard (which will fit is dependant on the shaft you use)

If you want to start from scratch I would suggest buying a pop-lite from ebay or a branded deck from www.warehouseskateboard.com Cargo trucks are inexpensive and very high quality. Bearings are cheap and you should clean them with acetone. For wheels it is really up to you. If you want to buy a complete (already built) then get a branded from warehouse skateboards. Don't buy elements because they snap really easy and are not good to start on whether or not they are a great brand. If you like have something against my idea of beginner boards just do your research and get a nice simple one. You want to look for ones with good pop and good concave.

When Defoe is fit with Campbell we looked good enough. Once again a new manager assembles a new team and gives the old players no chance to gel, this will end with Redknapp sacked within 18 months. The team needs time!<br>  To 'Fergie's Whistle' Rooney may be able to score on the pitch but I would bet you my grandmother he couldn't pull in a brothel.|`|85dnSnVAaa	i think yes because he is feeling more homely there than liverpool any way i like playing him more for hot spurs.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|pysi6GPuaa	yes  he wil score more because when he player for Liverpool a couple of weeks ago they never put Him properly on vs chelsea no vs Other teams yes and no if they put him in he wil score officially|`|oPYw0QYqaa	none in one game.... But yes i believe he will... he will get two against liverpool... Just like he did at Anfield last season!|`|KDChZAzlaa	Robbie Keane  could′t score in a brothel - unlike Rooney.|`|efGx6z3vaa	erm, He already has 100 goals for Tottenham, I am a GFunner and I know.|`|IWM1khX7aa	yes.

xRPjgGs1aa	Do this trade you get a great catcher a good 1B and you also get a fair pitcher.    <br>  Tips<br>  Don't bench Putz replace him for Armando<br>  Replace Mark for Troy<br>  Start Miguel Cabrera|`|piM3bj9Gaa	Verlander just isnt good enough.  You need the star pitching that peavy provides.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	I think it's a great trade for you.<br>  the players you get are all more consistent than the players you are giving up.|`|3G7Lpah5aa	Justin Morneau is a good player but i think Prince Fielder is a little better|`|NG98TGFvaa	Do it bro. All of the players are better|`|H82AYTpsaa	yah|`|DsF05nHZaa	do it! all three players you get are better|`|c6q3EERdaa	NO. Verlander had a bad year last year, and Peavy is very consistent. Also, Soto could be a star and Fielder should have another good year. Don't pull the trigger.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	no i wouldn't do it if i were you, Peavy is a stud, and Verlander was horrible at times last year....very inconsistant.  Not to mention why are you trying to trade a first baseman for another first baseman?  why not try to upgrade 2b or OF?  You could get a lot for a potential 50 hr guy.|`|hR87A418aa	do it jake PEAVY WAY better then justin velander..... look at his last year starts HORRIBLE...  N PRINCE FIELDER =STRIKE OUT MACHINE..... i was u accept it....REMEMBER Joe Mauer won another batting title last YEAR... <br>  <br>  GL|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	I say do it!<br>  <br>  x0 iCoNiC - The 1B is a wash because he's got Miguel Cabrera at 1st!|`|JQXCdGHYaa	do it
0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	I'd take it based on the fact that the rest of your pitching won't take a huge hit when you get rid of Peavy. Plus Verlander can't do nearly as bad as last year, hopefully. With Morneau and Mauer, you're getting guaranteed .300 average hitters, and you get BOTH with Morneau in homeruns, average, and RBIs. (Maybe not as many HRs as Fielder, but close enough to where the average out-does him) Fielder doesn't hit for average, is a poor defensively. We know more about Mauer then Soto, for all we know Soto could slump in his sophmore year.<br>  <br>  Take it.<br>  <br>  PS: Bobby Abreu stinks.|`|UoT86gbiaa	The C and 1B moves are pretty much lateral; you'd give up HRs and RBIs for batting average.  Thing is, you already have four players in Polanco, Jeter, Sanchez, and Damon whose primary asset is batting average, so you'd really miss the power numbers.<br>  The pitching is a serious downgrade for you.  Verlander is nowhere near Peavy's class of pitcher.<br>  <br>  I see no way that this trade would benefit your team.  Decline.|`|PbNcLBbqaa	No.  Fielder and Morneau are both great, with Morneau a bit of an edge.  Catcher wise, Soto had a very good season last year, and while Mauer is the best in the game, Soto is not exactly a bad option.  Here is the deal breaker: Peavy for Verlander is not good for you at all.  Verlander had a terrible season last year, and Peavy is a true ace.  Peavy is the better pitcher by far.  Deal with Fielder and Soto, you'll be sorry if you accept this.|`|PcJG3lrDaa	This reminds me of the 1954 episode of the Cheers when a baby elephant's gears were grinded after he walked into the local walmart and tried to buy a tub of salsa. Sadly he was turned down, due to racial discrimination. GO BLACK PEOPLE<br>  <br>  i hope i helped, but actually, i don't care|`|NG98TGFvaa	Definitely do it

IITnJjAjaa	Running in the morning on an empty stomach will be best if your trying to lose weight as it kick starts your metabolism so you burn whatever you eat more quick and in your case if it's in the morning, you'll be burning fat as you haven't yet eaten. Remember if you're trying to lose so much as a stone, you need to run slow or else you will build up too much muscle which will make you weigh more.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	The morning is better for most, because you run wont be ruined by other plans you may have with other people.  It also wakes you up, and makes your metabolism higher for the rest of the day.  If you do this, make sure you eat first, like an hour before you run.  Me, I'm an evening runner.  I just can't run at all in the morning.  I can run for miles in the evening, I can barely run a mile in the morning.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	A lot depends on where you live and what time of year it is.<br>  <br>  In Texas, for example, you want to run first thing in the morning during the summer, because that is the coolest time of day.<br>  <br>  Morning also works best if you run in traffic.  There are fewer drunks on the road in the morning than at night.  Another consideration is lighting.  By "morning", you mean after the sun has risen, you will be easier for drivers to see.|`|OKKfyLnlaa	It really depends on you.  I always feel faster and run farther at night, but if you get right up in the morning that ensures that you will find the time and energy to run.  When I train seriously for half marathons I do it in the morning on weekday so I know I will have time before the other pressures of the day start, but for my long runs on the weekend I tend to do it at night.|`|zXAM0untaa	I would say early in the morning as you are energised and in the night you are more tired and you wont be able to run for longer and burn more fat on whereas in the morning you would.So yes in the morning. Thanks.|`|bT0kyzRPaa	night your muscles are towrn through workout and are arstored by sleep.... and using more energy before sleep will cause you to sleep better and deeper.... if you are trying to lose weight n not build muscle then run in the morning before breakfast... but to tone up go at night|`|dzHbx8Zxaa	Going in the morning before breakfast is best, as it helps your metabolism run faster throughout the day<br>  .. although I always find I can run further and faster in the evening - I'm not really a morning person!|`|2gz6ad5kaa	use the buddy system at all times.its safer. 4 me running at night makes me feel super fast. hehe|`|ES8af3HQaa	night.. its dark and hardly any1 will see you.
MWSv1yfhaa	It would be awesome if that happened.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	1st he has to qualify to get in.  Second because he was good in the fall doesn't mean he will be good now.  Two different sets of conditions in the fall it was blistering heat the track was slick and now it's chilly the track has more grip.  The teams have to be able to set the car up for the different conditions everything is different, AJ will have to be able to adjust to different track and car set ups.|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	I don't see it.  He's good, I really like the guy's personality but think it's going to be tough to finish that well again this week.  Matt has the lead for one thing and he's not going to want to give it up now...lol, just like any of the veterens of the track.|`|ZYCLuvkmaa	I would be amazed if he would but A top finish at daytona doesn't mean you will finish high up at every race. At daytona alot of guys that finsh in the top 5 usually never finish there every week like aj allmendinger or eliot sadler.|`|i8soZLfRaa	I didn't even think he would qualify. He proved me wrong. Points lead, I seriously doubt it, but hey, I've been wrong ONCE today already!!  lol|`|CO2o0YYMaa	Sorry to bust your bubble, but it's not gonna happen. Although he is in better equipment, he won't take over the points lead.|`|XjJCMkWDaa	Nope not this week sorry!!|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	you never know.What a story that would be.I wish he drove the 43 instead of Reed.|`|MCWdcrpraa	I would not mind if it happened.

v0MlomPoaa	Assuming your are referring to NCAA Division 1 baseball, the committee tries to reward teams for their competitive success during the season.  They try to pick the top 16 teams on the season. For the most part if you're a number one seed, the committee will try to grant that seed the opportunity to host. There are 16 teams seeded #1 in the 16 regionals. Teams must submit bids to host a regional.  When you  see a regional hosted by a team other than the #1 seed, it is when that institution doesn't submit a bid, which has happened on occasion over the past few years. Or, they've got a facility flaw, for example, the field is torn up. A couple of years ago, there was a host who had just hosted a conference tournament and their field was just a mess. There maybe other flaws causing them to decline the school a host opportunity.  Of the 16 top seeds, 14 or 15 of them will be hosting., so you don't have a situation where an institution is buying the host opportunity.<br>  <br>  Super Regionals will be at one of the two regional winners site.<br>  <br>  There is a regional in the Carolinas almost every year.  Sometimes even more than one.  The regionals won't be picked until the end of the season.  I would expect there to be one somewhere in North Carolina.<br>  Chapell Hill would be a favorite to host one now.  Others that might have a shot, could include Conway (Coastal Carolina), Greenville (East Carolina, Charlotte (NC-Charlotte), Raleigh (NC State), and Clemson, South Carolina.
vgt0YtRxaa	With the uncapped seasons starting in 2010 I see the same owners who had success before the cap rule, ruling the NFL. With that said its going to be the teams that throw the most money around. Who comes to Mind? easy, Al Davis is already throwing money around because he knows it won't matter how much he spends now, so i expect Al to keep spending. and field a great team, Al Davis will pay any amount of money to field a winner. Same thing go's for Jerry Jones and the Cowboys. The raiders and the Cowboys were always in the playoffs before the cap rule. A few other teams were to but those owners are gone now. Most NFL owners hate the idea of an uncapped  seasons, but AL and Jerry are already preparing for it and both are  excited about it. Can't say any of the other owners are. One other team to mention is the steelers, Art Rooney will spend big buck to.
c4cf8d445ae0b6318e1822bbaf6cd71aaa	cleveland...fosho.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Celtics, Cavs and Magic? Don't forget about Detroit. I am not rooting for the Pistons but d'ya still remember what happened last playoffs? They did great, if not excellent even if they lost. Celtics already proved that they can make it to the top and they've kept the championship caliber roster. As for Cavs and Magic, they are a young team with lots of talent. Cavs also proved that they can make it to the Finals but still needs to have a ring and Magic is so hungry to get another shot at the Finals (Last time was '95 - Shaq era). Magic got talents same like '95. They've got a dominant center before (Shaq) and they've got Dwight (both are Superman), and they are surrounded by shooters just like '95 (Dennis Scott, Nick Anderson, Brian Shaw), now it's Lewis, Reddick, Turkoglu. The thing is that they don't have a leader that can make plays not unlike Boston and Cavs. Since Boston is pretty much confident that they can make it just like last year then maybe Cleveland Cavs will be no.1. LBJ got the heart of a leader and always want to be number 1. Want proof? It shows on his records.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Celtics: Which is a BIG deal.....If Cavs finish 2nd, they will have to play BOTH Magic and Celtics, to make it to the Finals.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I think the Cavs will be the best team in the east this year then the Celtics then the Magic.|`|X1f4icumaa	Celtics!|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	Who cares... no one is going to stop Kobe and the Lakers...

Yuvraj was slated to be next captain but his off field behaviour has cost him the job. And that was a blessing in disguise. Because Dhoni till now has been an outstanding leader. He is sharp strategist and great motivator. Both are all rounders in a sense that they have multiple skills. But Dhoni is able to change gears according to the situation. He talks about allowing his players to play their natural game. But we have not realized that he has changed his natural game in order to allow the rest of the team to be what they are. The only other person who is not playing his natural game but according to team needs is Sachin Tendulkar. And with all that change, Dhoni still maintains his No. 1 position in ODI batsman rankings. Yuvraj definitely has a capacity to blast any opposition on given day. But if you want to rely on someone to definitely win or save game for you, it has to be Dhoni.|`|HSXxRjysaa	Dhoni<br>  In the IPL,yuvi's performence was effected coz of his captaincy...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzz7FjFzHdY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzz7FjFzH...</a>|`|oGNeNlpnaa	i go with Dhoni<br>  cuz he changed the entire indian team to a winning team<br>  so i give credit to dhoni, yuvi just good when he bats good <br>  and Fielding..|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Dhoni still wins over  Yuvi,....for 90% luck<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers~|`|rnY99OrGaa	Both players are good but If i have to pick one from those to i would pick Dhoni. Dhoni has successfully captaining the Indian team. He also a consistent batsmen  also he rated Number 1 in icc rankings for ODI batsmen. Yuvraj is just behind Dhoni he ranked Number 3 in ODI. I think Yuvraj now playing more consistent now and if he can do this more he can became Number 1.|`|vHggsiJvaa	Dont keep any doubts in your mind about this questions.

z6pdWKa5aa	Me being an Auburn fan, I obviously would love for us to earn a trip to Atlanta. But due to the shake-up on the Plains, I doubt it. Bama has too much reloading to do, they have only 5 starters back on offense. LSU has even more reloading to do, but they have a mobile man in Jordan Jefferson and a defense that is never counted out. Look at Arkansas to be better... But not THAT much better. I think Ole Miss wins a wacky west over LSU, Auburn, and Alabama, and play Florida in the SEC Title Game.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	No because in terms of pure technical puroresu style wrestling, it would have to be the Japanese promotion Pro NOAH.The roster works an excellent style of wrestling featuring gifted wrestlers like Kenta Kobashi and Mitsuharu Misawa in exciting matches.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	No i disagree WWE is the best|`|JiCfYfLraa	when it comes to wrestling yea because there wrestlers are better then wwe. but wwe has more history,more fans and most of the tna roster are nothing but wwe rejects and washed up hasbeens like jeff jerret for one,billy gunn,road dog,mankind,jackie moore,rhyno,gail kim,kurt angle,booker t and many more in the company.|`|AA11482019	When it comes to actual matches, I do.|`|T13xM9iJaa	No worst|`|5cvKJNXLaa	It might be|`|WCX6kYITaa	WWE has bigger stars + is richer, more famous, has more fans, and is synonymous with pro-wrestling.

Plus, the fans always eat every minute of it up and are fully FULLY vocal and into it. <br>  <br>  WWE can't EVER EVER EVER EVER come close to this again. EVERYTHING in WWE is way too generic, predictable, etc, and it has been like this for a long time now. You KNOW it's a problem when people on the net (including many business insiders) think Randy Orton's current heel persona is "one of the best ones of all time". Heck, I EASILY (without BLINKING or BREATHING) rank nearly every single heel character in TNA at the moment over Randy, for the simple fact that they all don't sound FORCED or REHEARSED when they cut their promos...even Matt Morgan, cause at least he actually sounds legitimately cocky and a bit vindictive. In addition, who looks more like a weak stable...Legacy or the Mafia? EXACTLY my point. <br>  <br>  Then you throw in the young stars like Joe and Styles (who really ARE the faces and attractions of TNA), and even Abyss.....variation of styles with those three automatically. TNA REQUIRES that the work level of their wrestlers are up to standards, and don't pass off just ANYTHING (like in WWE) to give fans.|`|9gnVGV1baa	Tna could be if they and wwe continue their current trend but at the moment the dire ecw gets higher ratings than tna.|`|hpkOeOLyaa	when i was a little boy, i watched i think WWF, but now i see that wrestling is terribly boring.|`|AA11237905	TNA SUCKS WWE RULES.|`|ObWZD0gIaa	how about HELL NO!!!!!!! wwe and ecw miles better=]|`|2f342328e53df826906951ac96feda13aa	nah its a cheapmans wwe

Both teams doing well at the top of there indivudual divsions. (Serie A, Premier League) Inter are scoring goals which Man Utd are struggling to do after defensive 1-0 displays, but after all Van Der Sar is making Clean sheet after Clean sheet. Jose Morinho claims Ibrahimavic is the best in the world at the moment while Alex Ferguson has other ideas. It will be a great battle with Adriano and Ibrahimavic vs Vidic and Ferdinand.

IDBasYahaa	You can kick out on the full from in your 22, as long as the ball wasn't run, or passed back into your 22 by your own team.<br>  If it was taken back by your own team or your kicking from outside your 22, you can't kick out on the full, it must bounce in the field of play 1st. If the ball does go out on the full, the line out will be taken from where the ball was kicked.<br>  <br>  You always have the option of a quick line out, as long as the line out hasn't been formed, if it has, the ref will call it back. When taking the quick line out, under the ELV's you don't have to throw it in strait. The quick line out can be taken from anywhere equal to or behind the point that the ball went out.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The above two answers cover it pretty well. It was a good rule change to stop the ball being played back into the 22 for the line kick. It helps speed the game up and offers more enjoyment for spectators and players.|`|4jAdYR1Kaa	I agree with Aussie Chef but will add that a quick line-out cannot be taken if the ball was touched by an official or a spectator when it went out. It also has to be the same ball that was used in play before it went out.|`|6AFvANHtaa	Its only your ball when you kick it out if it is from a penalty, and this doesnt matter if it bounces into touch or not.

onySROuhaa	You do not want to submerge your head completely underwater when you are swimming freestyle.  Keep your neck in line with your spine and as you alternate sides for breathing turn your head just until your mouth surfaces enough to catch air.  Then roll your face back into the water.  When this is done correctly it will allow you to get the air you need and keep swimming quickly.  This is really something that a coach can help you with best.  However in the mean time I would recommend going to youtube and watching some videos of freestyle swimming.  There are millions of michael phelps videos on there that are good examples of how to do it flawlessly!|`|Fe15PkS7aa	when you want to breath turn your head to the side so that half of your goggles are in the water and half are out and just move your arms the same way or try just kicking on your side with  half of your face in the water and the other out and then start to stroke when you think you're getting the hang of it|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Try the style of swimming with standing on floor & bending forward. If you practice this on floor, the same can be applied while swimming.|`|eVubSKcEaa	I am quite good at breast-stroke but not that good at freestyle.. on the other hand my brother and my buddy are hard core freestyle swimmers.. They tried teaching me freestyle..<br>  The technique  is:<br>  When your left hand is paddling in water, your right hand goes to the lower end of your body.. so then you turn your head outside water to take a good breath.. then continue paddling till you need to breathe again..  Yeah, dont turn ur head to both sides to breathe. thats a big mistake.. breathe only for one side, either left or right.. the only way you can get this right is by putting this to practice... so keep practicing and do well in ur competition|`|LWsyxuMfaa	I have that problem too. the correct way to do it is to rotate your head sideways so you may be doing it right it just takes practice. Here are some good drills for practice:<br>  <br>  Deck Drills - good for warm-ups <br>  <br>  1. Stand on a step or side of the pool if possible so one leg can swing back and forth without hitting the ground. Swing the leg from the hip with the knee and foot relaxed. Notice when the knee bends naturally. Once you've learned it in slow motion, you can increase the speed until you feel like you are "whipping" your lower leg back and forth. <br>  <br>  2. Stand on the deck with one foot forward slightly and the other back. Feet no more than a foot apart. Jump slightly and switch which foot is forward and which is back. Repeat this movement as if doing an aerobic exercise. In water aerobics, it is called a cross-country leg action. <br>  <br>  3.Sit on the edge of the pool with the legs overhanging the water. This works best when the water level is lower than the deck. Lean back and with legs straight, imitate the flutter kick from the hips.<br>   <br>  Water Drills <br>  1. Flutter kick while holding onto the side of the pool. Works best if one hand in on the top of the wall and the other is directly below it approximately 18" deep for support. <br>  <br>  2. Kick while gliding away from the wall. Can be done without kickboards or with with kickboards<br>  . <br>  3.Exploration drills. This drills are meant to help students feel their kick better and to help them correct their own mistakes. Obviously, some of these ask the student to do it wrong so they can feel the correct form better. <br>  --Kick as fast as you can. <br>  --Kick as slow as you can. <br>  --Kick with lots of splash. <br>  --Kick with no splash. <br>  --Kick with no leg bend at all. <br>  --Kick as if riding a bicycle. <br>  <br>  4.Flutter kick on your side. Can use empty milk jugs for support orsome other flotation device. Helps the student to feel the kick both forward and backward. <br>  <br>  5Kick with fins on.<br>   <br>  6.Kick across the pool with head up. If swimmer can do this and keep mouth above water for breathing, they know they have a very strong kick. This is also called "alligator kicking". Good self-test drill|`|XTN6ZH2Paa	You have to learn to breath on your side. One of the most basic and important skills of swimming is breathing correctly. Before you get into the water, stand straight with your hands by your sides. Mimic slowly stroking (without the kicking, of course). While one arm is back and the other arm is right by your ear, pretend to take a breath. It may help to pretend that your ear is glued to your arm, so when you turn to complete the stroke, your head will go along with it. In the water, your mouth will be right above the water. Breathe quickly and finish the stroke. If you can learn to breathe on both sides, kudos to you! If you can only breathe on one side though, that's okay. You'll just have to hold your breath a little longer.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Usually swimmers just turn their head to the side with the arm that's pointing back (other arm is pointing ahead).  Your body is already in a slight roll with the shoulder of the arm pointing back sort of higher then the other arm so it's natural to turn your head to that side and take a quick gulp of air.  Watch the tapes of Olympic swimmers to see how they do it.  You're having problems with it now because it's still ackward to you but with enough practice, just like swimming, it'll become part of just a natural rhythm as you swim.  And if they do it in the Olympics, it is probably correct.  You might also want to check with your swim coach.  I'm surprised no one has taught you this already if you are up to competition standards.|`|AA11631715	as you finish your right arm stroke and begin your left, tuck your chin to your right shoulder and take the breath...exhale on the left stroke underwater.

AA11041009	YES.  You generally DO NOT get the best basketball out of teams late in the season, anyway.   Plus, basketball players openly admit to having to constantly "pace" themselves.  While there is virtue in pacing one's self, there is a cost to fans, which is lower quality basketball over the course of the season.<br>  <br>  62-72 games would make more sense to me. <br>  <br>  Go Lakers.|`|5ANmjtLOaa	82 is a fine number for 30 teams.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	65 games would be better, but that would take away from the History of the NBA. Making certain NBA records impossible to beat.|`|GoYT6SIHaa	it should be 100 games instead of 82.|`|BSqDYs1eaa	nba season should be non existent|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	That is the most exciting thing about NBA. You can see how good an athlete is. Basketball is a very physical game, even if we cut down the games, if the player is going to be injured then he will be injured. And that is the time that you can see another player on the team step up. Basketball is a mind game just like a chess, if your queen is caught then you play queenless but still the excitement is still there. And if your superstar is injured then another player or two will improved their game that makes the game exciting and unpredictable.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I disagree I think it actually should be longer only about 80-90 games they should have about 100 games.|`|2370f62875bd70c8746709dffc08ef47aa	no it should be longer.

But he will give 100% every game and when a player of his quality does that.. he could always get goals... Berba is a better player but when at Spurs he would be awesome for one game then go missing for four games cos he couldn't be bothered....

Just like us when Bill Nick stepped down.|`|5c2tW6d4aa	Spurs are just bad dude|`|0lACfoXSaa	Problem is this....<br>  <br>  There is no quick fix, Harry may seem the best choice but he is over-rated in my book.<br>  <br>  Ferguson took 7 years before he won the title and 13 before he won the champions league. Look at Moyes, how long has it taken him to build a decent squad?<br>  <br>  Spurs problem is that they want it all and they want it now.

KdhNCnEjaa	Farmer should start over Fisher this year as a Celtics fan. The only thing Farmer lacks is discipline on the defensive end, he has a tendency to reach a little too much, but offensively the two dont even compare.|`|VHphDgrhaa	No that is no way a Hater. No he shouldn't start over D-fish he might help the lakers bench points if he would get a little more minutes.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Because they dont know what the fu----oh, kidding, my bad! :)<br>  <br>  RQ: I think Fisher pretty much has the starting job locked up in LA for as long as he is still effective. He has done great things for that franchise. However, Jordan Farmar is a very talented young PG that will likely see his minutes increase big time, if not get the starting job, next season.|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	LOL<br>  You people always get my questions lol<br>  <br>  RQ- This one is a tough one because i Love Fisher and Jordy , but maybe he should wait another year and see<br>  <br>  the thing is I Like Fisher for his experince|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Lol|`|nz220kO4aa	If fish is still in a team i highly doubt it.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	The Lakers need to start Jordan Farmar at the lead guard slot and bring Derek Fisher off the bench. The bottom line is D-Fish has never been the reliable shooter the Lakers need at the beginning of games. He also doesn’t log a lot of assists, but in his defense rarely turns the ball over. This is because; he shoots the ball every time he gets it. Now I don’t mind guys that like to shoot the rock, but there are certain percentages needed to keep that privilege especially when you are the point guard, because you are guaranteed to have the ball a lot. Point guards that shoot a lot are synonymous with not losing, unhappy teams; see Stephon Marbury!|`|LbJqU82waa	HE WILL SINCE FISHER IS AGING! COMMON SENSE!!
e6TI1Uvmaa	I love my Oakland Raiders first of all, so I know all about our team. Anyway, we need to give him some more time. He has a $60 million dollar contract, we can't pay him that much money and not start him. We also can't afford another good quaterback. We'd be way over the salary cap. Plus, towards the end of the season he started to show some improvement and talent. I think if we give him a good quarterback coach and another year, he'll be good.|`|bJn83u7Oaa	While I don't put all the blame on JaMarcus, I still don't believe he's going to make it in the NFL.  I know his O-Line sucks and is WRs suck, but I just don't feel that he's going to be a good QB in this league.  Yeah he was the #1 overall selection, but he's not worth that kind of money and will never see another contract like that again.  The Raiders are just going to have to eat this one and let his contract expire before they can look at another QB.|`|Zp65xPQyaa	I would say give him a couple years. The problems in Oaklnad weren't really his fault. It would be good for Oakland to take some O line help in the first round and get a guy like Hakeem Nicks in the second to give Russell a reliable target. He doesn't really have anyone he can really develop chemistry with. He has all the physical tools to be great, he just can't carry a team alone.|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	Russell has a huge arm but he is really eratic. How about getting a veteran qb in there to mentor him? Try bringing in Kerry Collins? That's a stretch but Russell has the tools to be a good qb. He also needs dependable WR. The most receptions by a wideout was 22 by Higgins! That's ridiculous! The organization is in disarray and it's hard to blame players that may not have enough talent to be starters and its hard to blame coaches that aren't even on the team for more than a year. The defense is pretty solid, so once they build around Russell, they can probably contend.|`|2rmr5fLcaa	the raiders need to give him more oppurtunities to throw the ball!!!  what he has like 20 attempts a game? When you have that little amount of oppurtunities every wrong thing he does is going to bring him scrutiny. Mcfadden n Fargas need to stay jhealthy along with Bush to open up the play action game and they need a big time recieever..walker is injury prone and needs to be released...if the raiders can get a decent offense going..they will win about 8 games becasue there defense is stacked|`|8KmGcTW8aa	What I think is that JaMarcus Russell has the potential to be a great QB  but he was just thrown into the fire by Al Davis. Hes not a QB that comes straight from college and takes his team to a winning record. He needs a veteran QB to learn from like Jeff Garcia or Kurt Warner. Advice to Al Davis and Tom Cable: Sign a veteran QB!!!|`|vgt0YtRxaa	Not even going to answer this question. The kid is only 22, cut him a break, he has many years ahead of him.|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	Yes. Anything Al Davis can do to keep the payrole up and the Talent down, I'm all for!!!|`|f1HKgd4Gaa	well i think once Davis stops play musical coaching staff and the Raiders have a stable coaching staff Russell along with the rest of the team will do great , but it's probably hard leaning new systems all the time , they need to get everything stable and teach him a good system and he will be doing great|`|AA10957632	they need to better  train Russel who has always had the potential but the supporting cast and right training...............nope!|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	They are paying Russell way too much money to keep him on the roster and get another QB.   Thats way too much money on one position.|`|WNv8PDlzaa	for the fact that he played in one of the worse o-lines with mediocre WR's, and still managed to get decent numbers, he's shown a lot.  give him at least 1-2 yrs.|`|b8b71dd90d1df59ac71646789ff94ab9aa	Its the oline thats the problem....He has no time to make a decision...No Qb can do well if they are constantly getting pressured...The Oline is the problem and raiders need to get better WRs becase Javon Walker hasnt done anything...how can a QB do good with constant pressure, no blocking, and no reliable WR|`|KhBmlaefaa	So it's JaMarcus' fault? Tell me who in the hell is even on the Raiders worth jack ####? Even McFadden can't do much with that terrible O-Line. So I wouldn't be blaming Russ for the Raiders. My thoughts is Al Davis need to croak.|`|lNytOKH5aa	Micheal vick will really help|`|UgnMjtYDaa	no they should dip for a wr and an OT......

Ad8m1dYXaa	The WWE are NOT going to fire Mickie James... She is considered one of the most popular and talented females in wrestling, and is unquestionably the most popular woman the WWE have, she has been for about three years... She is also considered the future of the Women's Division (being that she hasn't even hit thirty years of age yet, and has already had the championship multiple times), and is incredibly SEXY (as ALL men probably know). The beautiful young woman has alot more things to do, and Vinny KNOWS he NEEDS Mickie James. Why fire the most physically talented (arguably) woman on the roster?<br>  <br>  Give it time... The WWE have done this to Mickie James before... Remember when Candice Michelle was champion? Mickie got pushed to the back before, it is like everyone just forgot about her (despite the fact that she is the no.1 most popular female wrestler). This has happened to Ms. James before, and I can assure you (unfortunately) that it will happen again at some point in the future, but Vince McMahon knows Mickie is the greatest (female) thing he has got, and in the end of her career (years from now), she will be the main star (like she always is)... For now, we can take pride in the fact that she has already had the championship four times, more times than any other woman currently in the Business - things could be worse...<br>  <br>  She will be champion before Summer (I hope and predict).<br>  <br>  What I want to see? The TOP FIVE greatest females the WWE have, against eachother: Mickie James vs. Beth Phoenix "The Glamazon" vs. Natalya "Nattie" Neidhart vs. Melina vs. Gail Kim... IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN... <br>  <br>  And yes, Mickie James has got the best mic skills of all the divas... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FympH-xxRRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FympH-xxR...</a>|`|Q1MI6L96aa	It appears that she is being phased out, maybe because her contract won't be renewed. The company is trying to make cuts where possible and the Divas seem to be the area where a hard look at contract renewals is long overdue. Talent will not be pulled off the road and onto mic work unless they are injured.<br>  <br>  Gail Kim is returning for an immediate story line that will get her wearing the strap. She is not coming in to simply feud with talent in secondary story lines.

Obviously, he cut better promos during his heel stage as the Attitude era allowed for more 'adult' content.<br>  <br>  He could make anyone look great in the ring and he gave Austen his springboard to greatness by selling his moves like no other. Being a great wrestler is not just about technical ability but being the whole package. At the moment in WWE, Randy Orton is such an athlete.<br>  <br>  That said, Bret's downfall is that he couldn't see the difference between his character and himself anymore, believing the Bret Hart character was as heroic as he was. He should've done what was right for the business and not what was best for Bret Hart the character.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No he wasn't the best but he was among them. He did not have the great amount of charisma but he could outdo most anyone in the wrestling world of his time with his amazing technical abilities.

lYnkvRASaa	I do, the real scandal here is the on ice performance.  <br>  <br>  The general feeling is that maybe Kovalev is not the bad guy after all.  He did take the bros K under his wing last year and maybe they found new "friends" this year.  That may be affecting Kovalev.  This probably takes some pressure off the GM/coach in some respects.<br>  <br>  If its game fixing people will be pissed, otherwise people are more upset with on ice performance than anything else.  If they had won 8 of the last ten this would not be a story that Hab fans even care about.<br>  <br>  The radio call in shows are having a field day though.|`|8NphFD9maa	I live in Montreal.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Big time mistake.  I've a low  opinion of Mr. Leow, and Kelly needs a finishing course in all aspects of boxing.  We saw just how out of sorts he was against Hopkins, he had no plan B.  No plan B is the direct result of a lack of all-around skills.  It happens to every fighter: he gets into the ring and his natural style of attack doesn't work.  A fighter needs a plan B or he's going to lose fights he shouldn't.  I'd rather see Pav train with Roger Mayweather, but anyone except Leow.
87BjduXvaa	if your paying $60 its Fake<br>  <br>  if your paying something like $200-$300 its real|`|NR5LhOpPaa	I'm guessing that it would be real, for a couple reasons. <br>  <br>  First, if it's in a real store, there's a much smaller chance that it's fake. Since you get to actually look at the frame itself, and hold it and everything, it would be very hard to pass off a fake.  If you were looking on ebay, it would be much easier to fake a racquet, because all they have to find is something with a decent enough paint job to fool the buyer.<br>  <br>  The second reason that it's likely not fake, is that the Microgel Prestige Pro isn't the most in-demand racquet on the market.  Two of the most commonly faked frames are the Wilson Ksix-one tour, and the Baboloat aeroPro drive cortex, because they are very popular frames right now.  Head frames don't tend to be quite as popular, and anymore, Prince frames are difficult to copy because of the O-ports.<br>  <br>  If you are that worried about it, just get it from tenniswarehouse.com. If you really want to buy it from that shop, ask if there's any kind of return policy if you find faults with the frame, or just decide you don't like it. If they do have some policy like that, then you can feel secure in buying it from them.  Even if they don't, it's probably fine to buy from them anyhow.<br>  <br>  As far as identifying a fake, there's a couple giveaways.  First, hold the frame and see if it's weight seems correct.  Most fakes are made with cheap, lightweight material, and won't be anywhere close to spec for that frame.  <br>  Next, check the paint.  Most fakes will have a similar paint job to the real thing, but they always miss something.  <br>  The last thing to check are the specs listed on the cardboard insert that comes with the new frame.  If the specs on it aren't correct, or if the cardboard piece just doesn't look right in general, then it's likely fake.|`|iAIv62HXaa	Should be right...especially if its in a store. Also, make sure it feels like a good racket. Like, demo it someplace first and try it out. If it feels fake and turns out to be real, then the racket didn't suit your needs in the first place.

ntLUHiTAaa	I agree with you, Denver has so many needs especially since their switching to a 3-4 defense because if they draft MLB rey mauluga thay still need a NT,OLB, also a number 2 cornerback because they released Dre Bly. On top of that they also need a running back, they do have peyton hillis but don't know if he could be a number 1 runningback.|`|fUUlywctaa	Tampa will most definitely take the biggest run at free agency. They have a void at quarterback and will do their best to try and attract that market. Arizona will focus mostly on re-signing past talent, like Warner and Boldin. Denver will have to look into the defensive market, but other then that, they're relatively set. Kansas also has some defensive worries. Tennessee doesn't have to spend much since they already have the pieces in place.<br>  <br>  In short, Tampa will spend the most.|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	denver is the closest to being competitive so prolly them... arizona to but they have so many internal conflicts they may not get to involved|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Denver, because they havent been shy about brining in high dollar free agents in the past.<br>  <br>  The other 4 teams, are usually cheap, and I dont see any of them making a strong push in the free agent market.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	I agree with you Denver needs:<br>  -LB ; all forms DJ Williams can't do it by himself<br>  - DB ; they need to start looking for a future replacement for Champ Baily and when they find him he can play opposite corner from him...for now. Also they need Safety's.<br>  -RB; This is probably their 3rd need because they obviously need defense. I think they burned through 7 running backs last year.

119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	Looks like a .32 Rimfire to me.  Kind of hard to tell, but looks like a pretty wide base to it, which leads me to think its the .32 Rimfire.  Those bullets are not manufactured anymore either.  <br>  <br>  It is a real bullet however, it has either been taken apart and made into a necklace or it was purposely made that way.  Either way its not a live round any longer.|`|0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	The caliber should be marked on the bottom of the case.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	it doesnt have any powder  or  a primer|`|h2KkiKK3aa	it looks like either a 455 webley or a 32 short colt, not sure though.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	It's a necklace... we had them when I was a teenager (about 15 years ago). They are made by removing the gunpowder from the shell and then drilling a hole in the side to place the chain in.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I'm pretty sure that's a .32 caliber.  It's "real" but it won't function.  The fact that a hole has been drilled through the case means there can't possibly be any gunpowder in it.  It was most likely constructed for this purpose.  No one in their right mind would drill through a live round.<br>  <br>  I once had one of these that was a .38 round.  When you pulled out the bullet, it had a coke (cocaine) spoon attached.  My dad had confiscated it in a drug raid.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	I would guess 9mm, judging from the size compared to the thumb.|`|AA12103790	its hard to tell for sure but it looks like a .22 rimfire with an odd bullet|`|5VELZt7Saa	looks like a 32 caliber to me too.

The thighs move upwards to lift the legs. The hands skull to the side just wide of the shoulders. The hands and shoulders, in unison, lift gradually.<br>  <br>  3. The body rises, and elbows bend sharply, while the hands move inwards on almost the same line as the outward skull. Leg recovery starts as the knees bend.<br>  <br>  4. The bent arms are drawn vigorously inwards as the pull ends. The hands continue forward without hesitation. The face clears the water as the body is elevated. The hips press downward, causing the legs and feet to lift.<br>  <br>  5. Shoulders and upper back are clear of the water and the swimmer breathes. A deep knee flexion brings the heels close to the buttocks with the feet just below the surface.<br>  <br>  6. The arms extend forward with shoulders following to enable the swimmer to get a longer reach, the feet are flexed outward as the kick starts. The head lunges forward and submerges.<br>  <br>  7. The hips extend, thighs and buttocks lift in reaction. Leg drive nears completion, feet accelerate through this powerful phase of the kick.<br>  <br>  8.

DnWsMhwLaa	i dont think they should be in the hall of fame, at least not until pete rose gets in. but i have a much harder time saying that the stats should be astricked or ignored, if for no other reason, because of the general feeling like this has been going on for a long time and the few that have been caught are just the tip of the ice berg and no one really knows how big a problem this is. the fact is that no matter what you do, someone who did steroids is already in the hall of fame. plenty of people did steroids and didnt get caught. do you just forget an entire generation of baseball? probably not. it isnt fair to lump the honest players in with the cheaters, but i think that is an assumption you have to take at this point, if they played in the last 20 years they are suspicious to me. i think we are just going to get used to calling this the steroid era.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Holy sh*t, it's pinstripes! :O =P Hey dude!<br>  <br>  I do not think they should be allowed in the hall of fame. To much of a question of how long and all of that stuff. If they did it I think they should be not let in!<br>  <br>  I know its kind of cliche by now but I think they should be putting the asterisk next to the stats of the players. It will still count but it will go down forever that the player cheated to get them which I think is worse than not counting them.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	I think that their numbers should count, because anyone can inject themselves with steroids but it is not everyone who can hit a ball that is the size of someone's fist traveling at 90 MPH, but they should not be allowed to join the HOF because they cheated to get there.|`|YWQdsoOMaa	Remove all of them past and present and start all over.  We know they used some kind of performance enhancing drug in the past, what is the difference now.

Regardless of the drugs they used, they still have to hit the ball!|`|qTnpXnNIaa	I know this isnt a great debate and definately not popular, but this is how i answered another question in regards to should they or shouldnt they let players be eligible for the HOF based on the accounts of steriod use;<br>  <br>  Great question, and i have wondered the same thing for a long time also. Matter of factly i even wrote to various magazines (sports illustrated, ESPN the Magazine ET AL) and voiced my opinion very much like you did here. If i may, let us look a little deeper into this in 1919 The Babe (thats right Mr. George Herman Ruth) hit a somewhat mortal home run total of 29 jacks in just over 430 at bats, the next year 1920 Mr Ruth hit a total of 54 jacks in just over 450 at bats (the things that make you say hmmmmmmmmm) and get this his nearest competition hit, wow, are you ready for this stat 19 Home Runs (Mr. George Sisler). It wasnt till the following year that Mr. Ruth hit 59 home runs and his team mate Bob Meusel was second in the league with 24 home runs (FYI.....Mr. Meusel was out of baseball less then 10 years later, ala Ken Caminiti (i dont know the details of why). In the following years the Babe hit home run totals more, how should i phrase this, Mortally, 35 in (1922), 41 in (1923), 46 in (1924) well you get the picture right ??...... but in 1927 history tells us the Babe hit 60 jacks that year, with team mates Lou Gehrig closely behind with 47 and Tony Lazzerri with (ready for this) 19. So yes absolutely do i believe that there have been performing enhancing drugs in baseball forever ?? YES !!! But do i believe we will learn anything or gain anything by proving this and keeping our hereos out of the Hall of Fame, what would the Hall of Fame be without Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Mantle, Reggie et al.......we can continue this debate and include Mr. Maris, how about George Foster, Cecil Fielder, and my favorite of them all Brady Anderson who all some how managed to hit 50 or more home runs at least once during their careers. The media has made this our so called Steriod Age something of a mockery and have pinpointed the heros and stars of our era McGwire, Sosa, Bonds, Clemens, Palmeiro et al and now are saying they shouldnt be in the Hall of Fame because they cheated us of something. I say they didnt cheat us of nothing, they gave us a show and as fans we ate it up, who else will ever come close to the home run display that we saw in the late 90's and early 2000, when is the next time you will see a pitcher win 300 games (ok i know randy johnson will break that barier this year) how about 7 Cy Young awards ?? So guess what media, it is time you turned your backs once again and gave credit where credit is due and enshrine the heros of our time ?!!!!!!!!! The players that made us say "HMMMMMMMMMMM" !!!!!!!!!!!|`|c6q3EERdaa	It's been a while, and I do remember seeing you here often. Too bad you won't come back!<br>  <br>  I understand you're a Yankees fan, so I can see why you're asking this. Honestly, I feel that all steroid users (including big names) should not be allowed into the Hall. They cheated on the game. It would seem to be a little unfair that someone who used steroids got in with others who didn't.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Take a page out of track & field and swimming....records and stats are removed if an individual pops a positive. For the HOF, it is obvious that if there are no "official" stats then an individual cannot be considered.|`|xIfvXy4waa	I believe they should. On this matter, I agree with what has been done. Steroids have not been illeagal for long, most of the players who took them, including Arod, were not doing anything against the rules in MLB. To be punished for a youthful, stupid mistake is okay to a certain degree. But if the player is sorry and handles the situation maturlely, then I think it wouldn't be just to keep them from the HOF. But that is just my opinion, I'm sure I will get thumbs downs :)|`|aUyopOWiaa	Hey! Of course I remember you.<br>  <br>  As for the question. No, they shouldn't The records shouldn't count and there's no way they should go into the HOF next to all these greats who did it naturally.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Absolutely.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	NO<br>  <br>  Drug cheating it is cheating<br>  <br>  but then again knowing baseball they will turn a blind eye in a couple of years

YhGm39qdaa	I wouldn't say he has completely lost his game, but its going that way. I honestly don't expect Federer to go back to his dominat form. There are just too many up and coming players that have already figured out his game and are much fitter. Regarding Nadal, yes I believe he is better than Fed. He has accomplished so much more at 22 than what Federer did at that age. Rafa already has 6 grand slam titles, at 22 Roger had 1. Rafa also has a 13-6 record against Fed, so yes that would indicate that Rafael Nadal is just that much better.

Had he faced opposition of the type Sampras faced he'd have found it extremely hard to win more than 6-7 GS's in his entire career.|`|Fe0zXe74aa	he hasnt lost any of his game he still plays the same he did when he was dominating but it just so happenes that the top 4 are closer in terms f level now than in 2004-2005 and even 2006,you have murray who once he gets a slam will be given the respect i think he deserves as he first beat roger the fist time in 2006 when roger was really on top then you got djokovic who got the respect because he won his slam but keeps losing it because of his "injuries" and finally nadal who just is that "stain on his t-shirt"that wont go away no matter how much you try to wash it off.plus they have improved alot and roger hasnt improved he just plays the same level he always has since his domination|`|RrGW4OzBaa	Nope, i think rafael is very strong now but Roger will still stay strong, he did win us open last season and came to the final in wimbeldon, semi in australian open and final in roland garros, he fell to nadal in wimbeldon and roland garros but the wimbeldon match was so close anybody of them could have won. Same with AO 09 it was very close, i just think Nadal has been pushing his luck, Roger is still good to go :)|`|e6TD1j1gaa	Right now Nadal is better, but he is one of those scrappy players that relies so much on speed and quickness. Nadal will flame out soon enough. Federer is fundamentally sound in every aspect of the game, therefore he will be a force to reckon with at least for a few more years (he's barely 27 yrs old)|`|svU3xeotaa	nah i dont think so, you know how all sports work every team or person have there season of fame and its just not fedrerer's season, u never know mayb next time he will dominate.

With the uncapped seasons starting in 2010 AL will continue to put out the  Benjamin's and shock the world. better jump on the raiders band wagon now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ir7JA6IUaa	Most people without ski pants wear jeans with long johns or sweat pants underneath.  You should absolutely take extra clothing with if you wear jeans as they will get wet when you fall, and hold onto sweat making you cold when you quit skiing.  The main issue with non-ski clothing is that the legs of the pants don't fit over the tops of the ski boots, so you have them all bunched up between your knees and the tops of the boots.  If you have loose nylon track pants with zippers on the sides, and they are big enough to let you wear something underneath, this is an option too.|`|fJbWRwsmaa	If you can, buy a pair at the mountain (or on the way there; ski towns are expensive) because nothing really works as well.|`|eBPApOcxaa	Stay away from anything cotton; it will soak up water and your skin will get chapped big time. Nylon windbreaker pants and/or polypro fleece is a better choice. <br>  Some resorts have clothing rentals.  If that's an option you will be much more comfortable. Or, if you have a Marshalls or similar store nearby you can probably get something suitable that's cheap.

7RUMbREoaa	That varies from person to person(as you will see here).<br>  <br>  I believe that Atlanta is the best track.<br>  <br>  I have to disagree with you about Bristol.Bristol USED to be the best track before they screwed it up and took away everything that the fans liked about it-the bump and run,one groove racing,lots of crashes,etc.They really ruined a great track when they repaved it and made it wider.I have only seen a few races more boring than the 2008 Sharpie 500(this year's Daytona 500 being one of them) and that's a heartbreaker because that used to be my favorite race of the year.Between the repaving and the COT,the Bristol of old is gone.It is nothing more than a smaller Dover now :(|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Daytona, Talladega, Martinsville, Bristol...<br>  To drive it would have to be Watkins Glenn..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Bristol is pretty hot. But I would rather see a Darlington race.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I agree with Bristol|`|8Z3PEaGeaa	Richmond International Raceway<br>  "The Drivers Favorite"<br>  <br>   Short Track racing with a Super Speedway feel!<br>  "It's a lot of fun to race on, it's kind of like the ultimate short track," Harvick said. "It not so small that you can't pass on it and you don't have to beat, bang and tear your stuff all up like other short tracks. You can pass and move around and do what you need to do to race."|`|AA11229410	Daytona will be paved when the economy comes back or never.  So Dega has to be the one for speed and moves.  But most of the action really is at Bristol and Dover if you must hate the road courses.  I still watch the those but I don't tell my friends when they go fishing on Sunday.  I don't go anywhere on Sundays or some Saturday nights.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	My favorite is Martinsville.  Its so small and intimate.  If you haven't been, do yourself a favor.  TV does it no justice.  <br>  <br>  I disagree with those that say Bristol was ruined. If anything, I think it was improved.  Fans are always complaining about a lack of side by side racing but end up not liking the tracks where you get it.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	Talladega with Bristol a close second !|`|XaYAcLBsaa	Best track DEGGA but the best time every year is MIS FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND, PARTY PARTY PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XEcoJnt4aa	I am not a big nascar fan, but I do thoroughly enjoy the Talledega race.

nH4TOhGVaa	thought the song in the year 2525 was all about Rangers eventually winning a league|`|bTNxl0ohaa	no, it will be at 22:30 tomorrow night back at the top.  then the pressure will be on celtic, who have only won 2 out of their last 6 spl games.|`|SjVukApqaa	If the grass was greener on the other side, would you go?

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	The issue may be what league you are in. Is there a no drop list? If there is he is still on that list and might not come off it for awhile. If you can drop him immediately I would, 8 weeks brings you to the end of the season and even if he comes back after say 6 weeks you get his services for what...5 or 6 games? And he wont exactly come back in top playing shape, the eye injury not only will affect his potential vision early on but it also will severely limit his ability to do simple things like run. So even if he does come back early I dont see you getting anywhere near max performance. Tough to lose your likely 1st rounder but find someone who can post any thing resembling good numbers....have a weak area, find someone who isnt all that great all around but specializes in an area of need.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Depends who is available, and if you're in position to make the playoffs in your league or not. I'd say if you're in the top tier of your league, keep him benched, and make use of him in the playoffs. However, if you need to get to that point, I'd drop him and hope someone at the top doesn't pick up and use him against you. Tough call, really depends on who is out there. I'd say if Eric Gordon is available, grab him, he's on a tear at the moment, scoring in double figures nearly everyone of his last 30 or so games. 15ppg and rising.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	I had the same problem I dropped him, hopefully he'll get healthy by the end of the year.  Keep an eye out, pardon the pun, maybe you can pick him up right before he's due to come off the injured list.|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	drop hes injured right now wait u cant even drop him hes 100 percent
jTaW3goeaa	Runs don't usually take me that long, usually the longest it takes me off the express quad is 8 minutes (time on lift included) but thats only if I go all the way over to the far side of the mountain, usually it only takes me six minutes.  <br>  <br>  Off the slow lift, runs have taken me 20 minutes top to bottom, but thats usually on busier days when the lift is constantly starting and stopping because people don't know how to load properly.  One time it took me 45 minutes to get down the  mountain but that was only after falling, laying there for a while and then having to explain to ski patrol I was ok to get down the mountain

Just going down their roster, it's loaded with superstars. Not many teams can match Villa and Torres up front. France is also a lot younger now, they could surprise. Brazil doesn't excite much, they looked bland in recent games. The Netherlands has a bad habit of choking. Italy can never be ruled out, and as long as they're strong on defense (which aren't they always?) and Buffon is atop his game (as always..) I see them competing at a high level. Germany is also looking very strong. (Gomez is becoming great..)<br>  Argentina also has a solid top to bottom lineup, and as the years continue on, I think Mascherano becomes an elite Midfielder in the world, if he's not already. Tevez is underrated and we all know about Messi. I put it like this<br>  <br>  1. Spain<br>  2. Italy<br>  3. Argentina<br>  4. France<br>  5. Germany|`|c4GykfVkaa	hope it'll be Argentina|`|tivIxrX0aa	1. Spain<br>  2. England<br>  3. Argentina<br>  <br>  Spain are a obvious choice. they have players who are experienced in the international scene, and play in different countries. England are second, because only spain have a better team on paper. When the whole England team is fit, then boy what a team it is. Ferdinand and Terry probably are the best centre back pairing in international football. Gerrard is a star of a midfielder, and can turn a game on its head. Lampard is the same as Gerrard, but to a lesser extent. Beckham is a brilliant crosser of a football. Barry is a good tackler, and can pass the ball. Rooney works incredibly hard, and all of his game is well polished. Heskey provides the aerial presence, and wins most aerial battles.|`|ph58F3Dqaa	wtf, england mate, we have got a lot of talented young english players and we will rip evreyone apart in south africa, just watch us, france u having a laugh, brazil, past it, italy, finish runners  holland wtf?! no chance|`|DEcunDd5aa	1.

GswnLKtQaa	Nice list, I think it's going to end up by a two man race with Mayo and Rose. you also forgot a very impressive rookie in Gordon from the clippers he has a chance to be ROY.<br>  <br>  brook lopez would end maybe 3rd behind mayo and rose but he's clearly the best bigman in the draft class. Marc Gasol will end up 7th.|`|GoYT6SIHaa	Derrick Rose|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	You forgot Greg Oden. He is still a rookie and unlike most No. 1 picks, Greg Oden doesn't have the same expectation of being that singular spark responsible for his franchise's turnaround. A large part of that burden has been accepted by baller extraordinaire, Brandon Roy. With Roy's breakout season, the Blazers went on a 17-game win streak.<br>  <br>  With a team already possessing it's go to guy on offense, Greg Oden isn't going to be expected to put All-Star numbers in that department. He'll be expected to do what he's done best and that's rule the interior by crashing the boards and defending the paint.<br>  <br>  Putting him in lineups alongside another 7-footer in LaMarcus Aldrdge or Channing Frye will ease the burden of guarding the paint. Remember, to win Rookie of the Year you don't need to put up All-Star numbers, you just have to put up good consistent ones.<br>  <br>  Greg Oden is destined to be a double-double machine. His NBA ready body should be ready for the physical nature of the pro game. It'll be easier playing alongside Brandon Roy with Roy the guy that defenses will scheme around. His first of many double double seasons to come.|`|2370f62875bd70c8746709dffc08ef47aa	its gonna be two man race <br>  rose and mayo<br>  and rose has little advantage because of his assists and better overall record compare to mayo and grizzles. mayo is averaging 2 point more than rose, but rose is averaging more assists, steal, and rebounds and he lead the eastern conference in points, assists, minutes played among the rookies so<br>  i think rose will be the rookie of the year. i wouldnt be surprised if the honor goes to mayo|`|fWMzd7y5aa	The only two people that matter Rose and Mayo.

The Legacy of 3 WWE Legends, The Legacy of the golden age of professional wresting is born!!! Randy has surpassed His father and Triple H. He is the World's youngest Heavyweight Champion!

PG1LuEk5aa	holy cow i see the michael vick question is going to be the new....what are the green dots mean on nfl helmets question....|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Vick was a worthless QB when he was in the league.  Its tough to imagine how bad he will be with rust on his arm.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Yes I do. Don't know where he will go. But in a land where you pay your debt to society, you shouldn't have to constantly be beaten down. There comes a point when a person needs to be able to move on and be productive. Vick's productivity is as a football player and now mentor to troubled youth. People need to get off his back. I'm sorry to say, but people hold animals higher than human beings these days. Vick hasn't raped, molested, or murdered anybody. Yes, he killed dogs and he's doing time for his actions. He's paid his debt. Plus so many people hate pit bulls anyways, the same people who right now act like they care about them by bashing Vick.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	Yes... i think he should be allowed to make a living. He's a football player. He'll be out of jail and into a half-way house any day now. And there are a few teams I think would be interested in him. I'm interested in seeing him play for another team. He's a walking highlight reel and a cash cow for any owner. He may even draw a decent contract. I also think he can beat most starting qb's in this league for the starting job. I think he could go to either detroit, san francisco, kansas city, tampa, chicago or maybe buffalo. Me personally as a dolphins fan I hope he comes to miami but I highly doubt that. He'll be a superstar again watch. Football is a violent sport that invites violent people. I think he can get passed this.                And also for those of you that don't think vick is a good qb you should check out his pro bowl stats in comparison with the likes of manning and brady and mcnabb.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think he should be back in the league.  I mean, Ray Lewis killed a man and got off scott free, Kobe raped a girl and even got his endorsements back, plenty of people have did stuff and not even "paid their debt to society" the way Vick has in prison, and it seems that everyone gets a second chance, so let the guy play.<br>  <br>  As for where he'll go, I'm thinking Oakland, Minnesota or the Jets.  Oakland has a rep of taking the bad boys, Minnesota and the Jets can really use a QB.  I think the Jets said they wouldn't go after Vick, but they specifically said last season they would not trade for Favre, they weren't interested at all, and well, you see what happened.<br>  <br>  As for his ability, Vick was a decent passer, but nothing great.  Where he excelled was his scrambling ability and his ability to make a huge play.  While he might not be a huge upgrade as a passer, his ability to make big plays could turn a team around.|`|e4WhipTHaa	Don't listen to Danny D, I like your question!<br>  <br>  I certainly think he will be reinstated.  In my opinion, he is going to be a BARGAIN for the team that gets him.  Yes, it will take time for the fans to adapt to him BUT he is going to be at such a low price.<br>  <br>  At much as I disagree with what he did, I would LOVE him on my team.  The guy is incredible even though his stats aren't so good for fantasy team's|`|NWXBqftkaa	I was a Vick fan before the incident happened. I think he's payed his dues. Lot of thinking goes on in Jail. I think a team will definitely take a chance on him. I wouldn't mind my favorite team the 49ers taking a chance on him. He'd look great in that cardinal red #7 jersey.|`|mNgps3qwaa	he ll go home

(Personal reason/theory? People in Boston are so uptight it creates too much pressure for the sports teams to actually go all the way.

r5AMG8g7aa	Shihan J gave you good advice. You don't really want to make it TKD and mixed martial arts together. Nothing against MMA, but it is not your thing. There will be trouble of you combine the two in the same class. Your comment about there not being enough TKD people there is not true. A lot of people study or have studied TKD. If you get it going you will not have a problem finding students to join. That assumes that the instructor is qualified and knows what they are doing. You do not have the experience at this point to be the instructor. Best to find a good one with at least 10+ years of training and at least 3rd dan.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Well, since your only experience in the martial arts is in Tae Kwon Do, you should teach what you do the best.<br>  <br>  I started out in 1968 at a mixed martial arts club: Kodokan Judo; Hakko Ryu Jiu-Jitsu, and Goju Ryu Karate.

vi1bbvCXaa	first you will need to hav a instructor certificate showing you can teach the art you want to teach. register insurance etc. talk to your college people for hall hiring. you will need at least one guy who knows your art to help you out. make sure you plan properly what you want to teach and your grading system etc. talk to your instructor about this. im sure once you get 2 1st degree blackbelt, you will get a blackbelt manual thing. make sure you have enough budget to run, estimate how many equipments you need and how much will they cost. promote your club properly in the college and make sure you promote in the local advertisements or online etc. give the people free trial for 1 week or certain lessons etc|`|W2YtVUqKaa	rule one of fight club is do not talk about fight club!|`|szcA8CDyaa	Teach you to self-defence and teach everybody to self-defence too.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	First you need to hire a hall on a regular basis, a scout hall, college or  any hall as long as it is reasonable in size to take at least 20 people upwards. Then you need to advertise a Martial Arts club in the local paper, in shops etc. You need to have a set price one for adults, one for children, keeping in mind children's classes need to worked around their bedtime, so not too late. Charges can be anywhere you would find a reasonable charge per person per training session. You need adequate insurance, this is where your Taekwondo affiliated body would advise. To start a club it would be a good idea to advertise it as a 'Beginners Course' this way you will have people who are not scared of coming along in case they think it is for established people only. Remember you can emphasise the need for 'women' as well as men that should learn self defence.
YDpT2ClBaa	you need to go to the main office of the collage and present this to them. tell them the style.<br>  you will usually need  offices like a president and a vice president|`|Bb8Ijj8xaa	first thing you wil need is a venue, make sure you can get it on the days or nights you want and also be happy with the price they look for it. second you will need insurance, both public liability and also instructor insurance, then put up a few posters in local shop windows or advertise in the local paper. <br>  <br>  if your a traditional martial artist i would stick to what you know.... mma is an area which anyone who has put on a gi or a dojang thinks they can do but be warned.... mma also means you need to be fit to walk the walk as well as talk!!|`|AA11101806	if you want to  start the club as TKD, you really need at least three people with black belts that are certified instructors so you can cover all of the classes being taught.  Then try to get 10 or more  people with different rank belts.    This should give you adequate instruction for classes, and also people at different skill levels to assist with class (and practice with each other) when people split into smaller groups.<br>  <br>  If you only want to start an MMA club, you need a top class wrestler, a jiujitsu expert (1st dan or higher), a couple people that are experienced in *different* styles of karate (1st rank or higher), someone that has a 1st rank belt in judo, and possibly a couple of people with a high level of experience in boxing. -- This way you can cover most major aspects of MMA.<br>  <br>  The TKD group can workout in almost any practice gym at the school since you can workout on a hard floor.  An MMA group needs use of a gymnastics or wrestling room, because people need to be on some type of mats to prevent injury.<br>  <br>  Also realize that an MMA group has to meet for a much longer length of time, because you have to cover many different techniques, and it is nearly impossible to teach everything people need to know, to a group of beginners.<br>  <br>  Then you have to register with your school so your group is a registered student organization, and you can gain access to the schools facilities.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your biggest problem with running an MMA club is trying to actually teach MMA, and letting people know which techniques to use in the appropriate situations.  The issue here is that judo, jujitsu, greco-roman wrestling, and each form of kenpo/karate will tell someone to deal with a situation differently.  Thus, each stylist will want to use a different technique as a defense, and to counter that point, some fighting styles don't teach how to fight against other styles.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	www.fightingarts.com<br>  <br>  under The Business Side of Martial Arts<br>  <br>  and Martial Arts Teaching and Learning<br>  <br>  www.martialinfo.com/owners.asp<br>  <br>  Good luck wish I had the guts<br>  to open up any business.|`|DPBgVA6Caa	You just asked this question.

Lebron James takes a basketball and hits Ray in the head with it. However, Ray and his 29th street posse jump Lebron James and beat him up. Ray Lewis pins Lebron as special guest referee Rowdy Roddy Piper makes the count of one, two....Lebron gets up! That is right! HE GETS UP! Lebron is still groggy and in pain from outside interference from Ray's 29th street posse as Ray puts Lebron in a camel clutch. Lebron is still in pain but he gets up and fights back. This time he will not be denied. He hits Ray Lewis with a steel chair from the outside given to him by Ric Flair who is sitting at ringside. He hits Ray Lewis with four--count 'em four--chair shots to the head and pins him for the count of three. Lebron's hands are raised and he is the winner of this epic and violent encounter.|`|zLcYfde4aa	Chuck Norris. He always wins. He also has a fist in his chin so he has the advantage.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Ray Lewis would rock Lebron.

If you have the playoffs secured, I would consider hanging on to him.  If you need every point from every player every night to make the playoffs, you may need to kick him loose.|`|sSOqEzqxaa	NOPE!

vF5lU8zeaa	for a 98 just keep your co2 tank but if you really want one then yes get the 3000 there really isn't much of a difference|`|AA12103790	IMHO a 4500 psi tank is not needed for a 98. most 98s in my experence gain little from changing from co2 to air. if the field you play at is one that fills air for free but charges for co2 then it might be worth it but even then a 2000 lb or 3000 should be enough.

SjVukApqaa	For a start, I think they need to give whoever is in charge of the team, a lot more time to implement his ways. Arsenal seem to be the only club who have stuck by their manager and if Wegner wasn't so gung-ho in his obvious lack of faith in the British pro, they would be even better than they are today.<br>  <br>  When Alex Ferguson does pack it in, United will not be quite the force they are at the moment and teams like Chelsea should be setting themselves up to take advantage of that instead of looking for that "instant' success at home and in Europe.|`|cxd2kSaSaa	They need younger players. If you look at their key players you'll see they are all about to hit the thirty mark - if they haven't already. <br>  <br>  And the need to stick with a manager, preferably Mourinho.

Cl6KbcAGaa	I never knew you could use "cheap" and  "durable" in the same sentence!?|`|AA12342474	If you mean cheap as in inexpensive (relatively anyway) try www.bikesdirect.com... I have a Kona cyclocross bike that I ride most the time that I have about $1400 invested in and I also have a Motobecane Fantom Cross Uno that cost me $400 and actually performs quite well. It is a single-speed with a flip-flop hub but because it lacks shifter and derailleurs it is bomb-proof. It's seen asphalt, mud, single track, ice, and snow without any issues (I've not been too gentile to it either). It is probably the cheapest new bike worth buying that I'm aware of. If you want a used bike you just have to shop around. If you mean cheap as in crumby, try Wallyworld but keep in mind it is a throw away bike, any major repair will cost more than the bike is worth and many bicycle shops won't touch it.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You can buy cheap road bikes at Walmart and durable bikes at the local bike shop, But you won't find a durable bike that is cheap.

IITnJjAjaa	Heres the key to it: Run slow (basically jogging) and your legs will slim down, but if you run faster, you will build up lean muscle.|`|zzvDybEiaa	Check out your parents legs, it is partially a genetic thing.<br>  <br>  I would recommend exercises such as running / walking.<br>  <br>  Distance and not speed would be the criteria, your leg muscles have to burn off the muscle energy, before it starts to utilize the fat resources.<br>  <br>  Besides, one other factor / our body looks mighty different to ourselves than someone else.<br>  <br>  There's probably a guy out there that will fall in love with you, because of your eyes / your butt /  Etc.<br>  <br>  A Beautiful Smile dose more magic than anyone can imagine.<br>  <br>  Anyway, running is a good way to meet people, with mutual interests.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Yup, the others had it right, just do LSD - Long Slow Distance. Slow repetitive motions are more inclined to tone muscles rather than bulk them up. So while you will retain some definition, long slow distance should in theory slim down ones legs. Though not too slow, a jog may not have the desired effect that an actual run may give you, but you will discover this in due time and with training.<br>  <br>  Someone who has a fast twitch muscle - ie a sprinter - would be more inclined to build muscle mass from their workout because of the abbreviated fast paced workout that they do. <br>  <br>  Could your legs stay the same, yeah, but if you are feeling better about yourself in the end, then it would appear to be worth it, regardless of the outcome, plus there is the whole cardio-benefit aspect to running anyhow. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy the running.

37evQRaDaa	I used to use a single speed cruiser to commute to work every day.  I know people who've ridden 40+ miles in a day on cruisers.  It just depends on what you're comfortable riding.<br>  <br>  I prefer to ride a road bike with thin wheels because it takes less effort.  Your best bet is to just try it out.  Give yourself some extra time at first, and if it's going well, continue.  (If you're not used to riding these kinds of distances, give it a couple or three weeks before you get too discouraged.  It takes a while to acclimate your body to this kind of new routine.)<br>  <br>  By the way, I ride 6 miles to work (and back) every day, and there were many days I rode a cruiser.

Neither bike was designed to ride long distances.  Not that 8 miles is that long a distance, but it is to you.  If you can't get at least a Hybrid, I suggest you try and ride the 8 miles as practice.  Then YOU know if you can do it and we can stop guessing if you can.<br>  <br>  On a road bike 8 miles is a piece of cake.|`|dq51okHIaa	8 miles should not be too bad; i would put mor pading in the seat and longer rear shocks if they would fit if i was going to ride say 300 mile every day.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Gettem' McG! yes you probably can this is not far to go and since you seem young anyway, you have plenty of energy so USE IT!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Yes.

If you screw up when it really counts, it could very well cost you your life...even when "civilization" is "only a phone call away" (that cell phone might not work, for a wide variety of reasons, and it might take a week or more for the rescue crews to actually find you - if they find you).<br>  <br>  Be safe -- keep in mind that just because someone says something is "safe to eat", it could actually be poisonous.

I guess it is what you have, and I do not know how to improvise a bowstring.<br>  <br>  For the bow itself you need 5-6 feet of hardwood, preferably ash, fresh enough that it will not snap under tension.  You can use a sapling if you need to but it will probably bend too much to give a good pull.<br>  <br>  Shave the wood down nice and smooth and make sure there are no cracks, put in notches near the ends to hold the string.  If you can make an arrowrest out of a branch stub, great, otherwise clean them all off.<br>  <br>  For the arrows you need strong straight sticks - more likely than not you will need to take some bigger sticks ~30" long and shave them down.  Making arrowheads is probably beyond your capabilities, so just sharpen the tips and harden them over flame (as close as you can get without catching fire).  Fletching again is a problem, but if you can get close you will not need it as much.|`|AA10249078	A  survival shelter is easiest to build against a tree or trees. Find a long branch or slim sapling, then find two trees that are approximately 5' to 6' apart each having a branches at about the same height. Lodge each end of the sapling in a notch of the trees.<br>  <br>  Then using other branches and saplings lean them against the overhead sapling.   You can put them on just one side for a lean-to or from both sides for a tent-like shelter.  You can use vines to attached the framework together.<br>  <br>  Cover that frame with what are called “spider branches” which are web-like branches that will reach all over the shelter. They are abundant in most areas and make good tinder as well. If they cannot be found lying about, they are on the bases of most trees.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.survival-homestead.com/wilderness-survival-shelter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.survival-homestead.com/wilder...</a> for more information|`|3C4zchTNaa	yes ash is great for a survival bow. I have made a bow using ash and some kind of string and the arrow can go about 200ft.  I also used a doul rod for the arrow and for the fletching i used duct tape.

I also helped my team by getting steals and being a good passer. <br>  <br>  My weaknesses were fouling players when I went for a steal and like I said before, I was a ball hog in the beginning. I was a bit of a sore loser too...|`|4DcvpQXfaa	I play PF<br>  <br>  #21<br>  <br>  I averaged double double|`|kzYdVfifaa	My strengths: Driving to the rim, Getting low on the post. (for my size that's great) Not scared to go for a rebound, I'm actually great at cleaning up on the boards. My passing is sick though, kinda like a CP<br>  <br>  My weakness: I get drunk with it, I try to take over a game and doesn't always work out. Depends on what day it is. I don't step  up when needed, which makes me underated. My lock down D needs help. I'm better at help defense<br>  <br>  I play PG-SG and wear 24. (Not because of Kobe) there's a reason why but don't wanna explain it.|`|HiuNSScLaa	i play center and point gaurd yah pretty weird if were losing at the end of a game im the best dribbler (im a born sg sf) on the teamso i take the last shot and all that but im also th biggest and tallest on the team the shortest center in the league but i lead the league in fg% blocks assists points and rebounds #4 in steals oh and #1 in not turning the ball over my jersey #5i havent taken a 3 but outside of the paint ive taken 7 shots havent missed one and am 6/8 from the free throw line|`|NmXKPDoIaa	PG/SG<br>  #7<br>  <br>  Strengths: Defense,quickness,can make circus shots, great scorer, great rebounder<br>  <br>  Weakness: My passing skills, getting in foul trouble|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	I played Point Guard and wears jersey no. 21. I am really good at dishing out the ball to open players but I am not that good in ball handling.|`|b9ShNrWoaa	I'm PG.

IDBasYahaa	Steyn will be the test for him. If he can perform against him, he'll do well.|`|AA11088802	hope for his best..<br>   thanks to yahoo that its not given this mess "this Q is not appropriate for any section"|`|Leoc8rlGaa	I didn't realise Will Young had taken up cricket! Maybe he's better at that than singing.<br>  <br>  As for Phil Hughes, the series will either be a tour-de-force for him, or a bit of a damp squib. I suspect he will do alright, as not many people have seen him play, and judging from his Shield record, he has the ability to score runs and handle pressure. The acid test for Hughes will be when he has been around the international scene for a while, and teams have worked out his weaknesses. For the moment he is an unknown quantity, so whether he prospers or not will depend on how sound his technique is, and whether he can handle the pressure.<br>  <br>  <br>  And perhaps Y!A have a point in wanting to post a cricket question in TV/Soap operas.|`|Eq6LEVq0aa	Well i can tell you it won't be an easy task. South Africa have already targeted him. <br>  'Our video analysis chap will be hiding behind the sightscreen in Potch with his camera' says Mickey Arthur.<br>  South Africa have actually got a camera man out there in the current tour match ready to record every move of Phil Hughes, they'll actually be hoping Hughes gets some runs under his belt so they can watch the footage in order to prepare for him.<br>  <br>  For Phil Hughes i think he's just got to come out and play naturally, South Africa are looking to tame Hughes just like what they've claimed to have done with Warner. There's no doubt that it's going to be tough, but that shouldn't alarm Hughes, he shouldn't come out and try anything too special, just play naturally and he'll perform well.|`|8FUAMccRaa	Depends on his mindset, if he tries to be like Matthew Hayden then he'll fail. If he  bats like Phil Hughes he should do well in the international arena|`|5GUjFJjkaa	I think he has the ablility and calmness to succeed.|`|v8w2BUutaa	To start your test career on South African pitches against the likes of Steyn and Morkel will be very difficult so I would think he will find it hard but if he makes some decent innings then he should be considered a good emerging player.|`|CoeOAH3faa	He look better for an add commercial!!, performance, honestly i doubt it, he's still young!!|`|gNeFtZdBaa	hi i am from usa and i learning cricket becuase its better than BASBALL

But that wouldn't have mattered if Santonio (OSU star by the way :) ) hadn't got some on Saturday nite LOL. Ohh and watch the replay; on the 100yd INT return, larry Fitz was about to pull him outta bounds (if not tackle him) but a CARDINALS player on the sideline wasn't 5 yards away from the field of play, and Fitz ran into him and got wrecked|`|Cody3Begaa	Yes.

I agree  completely. I mean, Randy Moss ( while he was with the Vikings) made $10,000 a minute. Thats more than I make a year. So yes they do make way too much money.
ad88b8ea18e3c82251404395d95b8510aa	Maybe I am speculating but he decided to skip the Pro Bowl because of the biceps injury so he appears concerned about getting it healed up. That makes it look as if he's not planning to retire. If he were to retire he would not skip the Pro Bowl. He would have most likely made that his last hurrah.    As far as staying with the New York Jets...I have a gut feeling that no he will not be back with them. They are about $13 million over the salary cap and ironically Favre makes about $13 million a season. Couple that with the fact that it sounds like they want him out and it makes for an interesting situation for the Jets. Scuba Steve is right, the Packers did not want to see him in a Vikings uniform so they bound him to New York with contingencies but if the Jets release Favre, the possibilities are endless because he could sign anywhere he wants to with no compensation to any team. It is important to remember that. I look for it to happen - New York will release Favre and rid themselves of the salary cap problems and rid themselves of the hold that Green Bay has over them.    I think Favre can still play very well but unfortunately everyone may remember him most for throwing all those interceptions during the last month of the season. Instead, I think it is important to remember the job he did before the biceps injury, which caused him to lose arm strength. Some may laugh at me for saying it but Favre might have been the league's most valuable player if he hadn't suffered that injury during the final month. He took over an awful Jets team who 4-12 the previous year and had them 8-3 before the aforementioned injury. The Jets still finished 9-7. I have to wonder what he could do with a team that just needs a quarterback to push them over the hump. I can say one thing for sure - there is no way that he will sit there without someone interested in signing him. One guy above said he will retire when he can't find a team. That could not be farther from the truth if you ask me.|`|XLXncQu9aa	That is a possibility.  I think there are many factors that go into his decision to stay.  The first factor is that he wants to leave with a clean record unlike he did this past season.  Who wants to go out their career not making the playoffs and not living up to the hype? He certainly did not live up to the hype.  Secondly, I'm sure he wants to help that NY franchise get back to winning games or at least contention in the playoffs.  If he retires, then who do they have they can rely on?  That is what the Jets did wrong.  They put all of their hope in Favre not knowing that if he left they wouldn't have a decent QB to back things up.  I believe he will come back for one more season just to try to get the Jets back to the playoffs at least.  But the smart thing to have done would be to have retired after GB.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	I think it's time for Farve to retire.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I hope he stays, because we really don't have another viable option right now.    Do I think he will? Honestly, I have no idea. He's suggested to GM Mike Tannenbaum that he plan for the season as if he wasn't coming back. However, that may just be his way of avoiding unwanted attention.    Tannenbaum, owner Woody Johnson, and new coach Rex Ryan, have all stated that they would like to have him back. Most of the players have stated that they would welcome him back, though the media has focused instead on the two players who have voiced their objections. I don't think that will be an issue, anyway.    I do appreciate the fact that he's so far been quiet about it. As long as he decides before the draft, I don't see any reason to press the issue. If he comes back, great. If not, we'll see what Brett Ratliff has too offer, or maybe sign a veteran like Jeff Garcia. Either way, we need to draft a quarterback for the future.    (edit:) If he goes to the Vikings, the Jets owe the Packers three first-round picks. Ain't happening. He'll play with the Jets next year or retire. He's not going anywhere else.|`|UxooffHZaa	Yes. I think he'll be back for another year or 2. But, each off season he will "retire" then flip flop back.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think he is gone...............|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not a chance because they openly hate him and have stated it to the press.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	retire|`|4ec0a31b1f8ce574de49a57391c919f9aa	i think he will play for the jets..i think he will want to be released..but jets dont owe favre anything like the packers did...if jets are stupid enough to release favre though...he'll be a viking within a day|`|2VGbJtnCaa	He is a giant premadonna! He is now trying to get out of New York and get to the vikings! Were he wanted to go all along.|`|9sQ8OQqnaa	He's done. Apparently his teammates don't really want him back. It's time for him to let go.|`|0WPdeB4Paa	If he doesn't play in NY, he will try to get on with another team.  He doesn't know when to quit even though he is long past his prime.  He can't play in the cold anymore and he runs out of gas before the end of the season.  While he was once the seasoned-veteran everyone wanted, he is now the old man the other players don't want to see.  He will quit when no one will sign him.|`|FCXzgwC7aa	I think he'll stay with the jets for a year or 2 and then he'll either retire or go some place else

OfNTLq3Qaa	You know I really struggle with this question. Yes, he did bail on the fans but he did a lot for the WWE before he left. When Austin was out for more than a year during the Attitude Era, the Rock carried the WWE on his shoulders. I remember classic promos between the Rock and Triple H, and classic matches.  I think the Rock bailed while he was still on top. His character really couldn't go anywhere else. He had already done everything he could do. You might say the Rock was so good that her performed his way right out of a job. I think he was tired of the schedule that the WWE forces on superstars. I am not defending everything he did but just trying to see it from another point of view.|`|ELcEOOWTaa	Tell you the truth, I agree with you when you say Rock sold us out. I love him and I respect him for everything he gave us, but I just feel shortchanged. I can't help it. But to answer your question, I believe that he DID have a passion for the business. I think he DID love what he did, but when he realized that he could make more money in Hollywood and not work the WWE schedule, he left. I can't say I blame him for what he did, but like John Cena has said, don't give me some schtick about "loving the business" when you have basically abandoned it.    P.S. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE THINK|`|fqrE36YSaa	He left because he wanted to be the father to his daughter that his dad could not be to him. The WWE schedule is insane. He loved his wife and his child. If I had been him I would have done the same thing. He said he might come back. We will just have to wait and see.|`|ZDyiSTwoaa	i think he did have passion he was a great champ and hardly ever was beaten ok the rock is great really great he is just great yes very great GET IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|O6WSs2s5aa	He didn't care about the business he was only in it for the money if he loved it he would still be wrestling not making movies|`|lzbxT6p9aa	I think that he did to begin with. I mean he gave up a pro football career to become a wrestler. I think that once he was at the top, he wanted a fresh challenge so he decided to move onto movies.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	You don't make it to the WWE without being a good wrestler and having a passion for the business so i do think he started off passionate about wrestling but like everyone passions change. I wouldn't call what he did betraying wrestling, he gave you many great memory's and decided it was better for him to move on while he could. Lets face it he wasn't a great wrestler in terms of in ring skills and in a era which is more about wrestling than talking that we have right now i think the rock did the right thing.|`|AA11105507	It's so funny to read your comments about how he "betrayed" us wrestling fans, or how he sold out.  Grow up!  Think about it...if you had the opportunity to take a job where you didn't have to put your body through hell week after week, and you were going to get paid more, you'd take it too.  So don't call him a sell out or accuse him of betraying the fans.  He did what anyone with half a brain would do.|`|RskPXtibaa	i use to love him when he was in wwe  he betrayed us all and made us look like fools  i dont even watch his crap movies  all he wants is money and he dont realise its us who placed him where he is now    money will die when u die  but his name in the hearts of the fans wont die forever  he doesnt relalise it

f6JWEBdDaa	I would love to see Carolina try something like this! There's no doubt that Peppers is a freakishly gifted athlete, and could certainly do the job! And I sure would love to see him stay a Panther! But...I'm afraid that Fox is just way to conservative to scrap a system that's gotten him to the playoffs so many times! (Kinda hard to justify a switch when we went 12-4 this past season!)<br>  <br>  But who knows! Nice to ponder the possibilities! :-)<br>  Good question!|`|cDKkKEgvaa	That would be very interesting, I would like to see that happen and see how Peppers does as OLB, he is very athletic and could easily do it but it all depends on if it works or not<br>  <br>  Baltimore, Cowboys, and Steelers use 3-4 defense and their constantly ranked in the top 5 in defenses...........who knows it could very well work with Carolina|`|WL1cX9rTaa	peppers is leaving so that wont be happening|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	That's why Peppers wants to go to a 3-4 team because he see's a player like Demarcus Ware get 20 sacks and he wants better numbers, but he needs to realize that he's not D. Ware, Ware get's those numbers because he's the best pass rusher in the game.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Peppers obviously wants out of Carolina...so, after this season, don't count on it...He's around for one more year thanks to the franchise tag...Then, he's gone like a bat out of hell...
8bTder08aa	I was taught that 1 lb weight = 1/5 second = 1 length when handicapping horses, as long as:<br>  <br>  The horses are carrying weights close to the Jockey Club Scale of Weights;<br>  <br>  The track is fast;<br>  <br>  The distance of the race is 1 mile +,- 1 furlong.<br>  <br>  Weights the horses carry are supposed to equalize their chances of winning.  In allowance races, weight penalties are based on how many races of a certain type a horse has won recently.  In a handicap race, the track handicapper assigns weights based on his assessment of the quality of the horses and their competitiveness relative to one another.  <br>  <br>  FWIW, for the vast majority of races, I don't think weight is much of a factor.  Most races are run with horses carrying weights below The Jockey Club scale of weights.  (Here in California, the California Horse Racing Board has the scale of weights included in their rules governing racing:  <a href="http://www.chrb.ca.gov/query_rules_and_regulations_database.asp?form_query_action=display_rule&form_query_rule_number=1615&form_query_rule_title=Scale+of+Weights+for+Age%2E&form_query_article=Scale+of+Weights+for+Age%2E&form_query_article_index=7&form_query_argument=1615" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrb.ca.gov/query_rules_and_r...</a> )<br>  <br>  When you have horses carrying weights higher than the scale of weights, the differences in weights carried become much more critical.  In other words, the difference between 115 pounds and 118 pounds doesn't matter as much as the difference between 127 pounds and 130 pounds.  <br>  <br>  If weight was actually an extremely critical factor, then a jockey like Laffit Pincay Jr., who had to carry overweight in many of his races because he couldn't make weights below about 114 pounds, would never be successful.  In fact many trainers were happy for Pincay to carry as much as 5 pounds overweight because of his quality as a rider-- and because the horses weren't usually carrying scale weight even with the overweight.|`|zywy6vOGaa	1 kg = 1 length. So in a handicap race if a horse has 58kg and another has 55kg the handicapper believes that the horse with 58 kg would be able to beat the horse with 55kg by three lengths in a set weight race.<br>  <br>  So when it comes to handicap races the best horses get the biggest weight to "slow them down" to give everyone an equal chance. And in weight for age the younger the horse the less weight and fillies and mares carry less weight then the boys.<br>  <br>  Its all about making it a level playing field for all involved.|`|GMcdPLoIaa	Less weight equals more speed, so they make all of the horses carry the same amount of weight so that there isn't an advantage by going with a smaller jockey.|`|8lsBBK62aa	Put it this way. If you were running against somebody your equal but you were given a rucksack to put on your back containing 3 or 4 Ibs of butter then you'd probably get beaten.<br>  Also you'd have to buy a new rucksack cos the butter would've melted.

First of all, Chauncey is like the Ray Lewis of Basketball, He makes your team better, and play defense. Allen Iverson however doesn't believe you should go to practice|`|AA10896470	They should.

Regardless they gave up over 30 points quite a few times this season. They need a new QB. Delhomme is washed up. Maybe they could get a trade for Peppers with some good draft picks and a mediocre player. That would be my best guess.

1X8c2hEFaa	nba just want the nba players to be little more mature, because if your from high school your a little immature than if you go to college at least 1 year|`|YwpKrQOsaa	I heard they're going to be increasing it to 2 years and at least 20 years of age in the future.    There are quite a few reasons    1) Players gain some knowledge and are a little more mature when they arrive in the NBA although Brandon Jennings bypassed this by going to Europe.    2) Gives you a chance to gain some physical durability before taking on the challenge of an 82 game season.  Look at Bynum, he's only 21 and is already labeled as injury prone. McGrady would be another example of a guy who wore out his body at a young age.    3) Keeps players out of trouble because they aren't getting rich so young, chances are if you're given a multimillion dollar contract as a teenager that lasts for like 7 years, you're either going to slack off or get into a lot of trouble because you can now afford to.    4) Revives the concept of a student athlete at the HS level because now they're forced to take their studies a little more seriously.    5) Too much of a do or die situation. Shaun Livingston is a tragic example of a guy who made the jump and suffered an injury, and is now getting kicked around the league.  Chances are if you attend college you can go back to get your degree at some point.|`|HcSQPUYWaa	There is no point.  Because if a high school player with bad grades is a guaranteed lock for the NBA, they can just go to Europe for one season and bypass college altogether, and get paid while they're at it as well.  Look at Brandon Jennings.  He said screw David Stern and went straight to Europe. He is getting more of a basketball education there than he would playing in college.  Plus he immediately gets money to help his family, then after one season in Europe, becomes a top 10 pick in the 2009 NBA Draft, if not top 5.  In your face David Stern!|`|xm2ZxPXXaa	to get an education, so they won't behave like kobe bryant,  arrogant  selfish  putting down his teammates publicly!|`|fqrE36YSaa	So that one of year of college ball can give them an insight into the dynamics of playing at a higher level. Besides when Kevin Garnett came into the league...they ate that boy alive...It was shocking too.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Because when you come out of high school your like 18, 19 ish, & if you come to the league you're basically going to be playing with like 23-38 year olds. I think that's why they did that.|`|p82QGArCaa	The THEORY is that High School athletes will take will take academics more seriously if they know that they must complete a year of college before turning pro. Does the theory work? Who knows?|`|8KxurcApaa	The NBA has several arguments about maturity & other BS but the real reason are (1) the Players Union wanted fewer high school phenoms coming in and forcing older players out and (2) establishing a farm system so NBA teams have more data on the high school phenoms.    The rule change was attempted in the past but always failed until the NFL somehow*** won their ruling in federal court.  That said, the NBA still wants the phenoms so they accept them after one year.
z5rlyGXNaa	The Trail Blazers will be a Championship Contender if this happened. Which wont!|`|0h52QcPbaa	Bad trade....|`|D6Llh23Baa	no, they won't. they lose blake, a very good passer (and underrated at that). they get wallace and morrison, who both wouldn't fit well with the portland's current chemistry.
AA10939368	I thought that Holmes was an appropriate choice, the only other player I would have given it to was Big Ben.  He played well last night and was able to extend plays.     I was dissappointed with Harrison and his behavior although it was understandable.  Gandy held him almost the entire game and was flagged personally 3 or 4 times.  He also committed two facemask penalties on Harrison, neither of which were called.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	no Standing over another player and beating him down, should have got him suspended from the game. No wonder the steelers won.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	I think that Santonio was a good pick for the MVP, I felt that Big Ben would have also been a good pick. Harrison would have been my third choice. He lost his cool there in the fourth quarter, I guess he was getting frustrated because it seemed like he was being held a lot and even though they flagged Gandy three times he should have been flagged a few more times. He couldn't handle Harrison.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Yep. Beating the crap out of a player for no reason definitely made him deserving of that award.|`|7RziqsDcaa	No since he beat up one of the Cardinals players (they say he should have been kicked out of the game).    Anyways, they were like in love with him after he scored that TD.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	harrison should have been ejected not even close to a  M.V.P|`|eIOlBzm8aa	bandwagon=you|`|yg3Pveakaa	I think he was considered but the real battle for the MVP was between Santonio and Ben which Santonio won because of his clutch plays and the game winning tip-toe TD reception over 3 Cardinals players.|`|osI8T5rMaa	Nope i don't think so i'm a steelers fan,he did give the  steelers 7 pint score when he run back all the way to the end before the first half is over but it doesnt mean he can do what he did last night its kind of disgrace for me .Harrison or big Ben deserve to be the MVP.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	What Harrison deserves is a $100,000 fine and an 8 game suspension for those sucker punches.|`|Z9uZ98Msaa	No the douche beated the crap out of a player when he was down on his knees. And kept on going. The only thing he'll get is fined.|`|UefCjbvOaa	no beacuse he was acting like how micheal vick would have with a dog in that penalty.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	He should have been ejected for his excessive cheap shots on the play where he wouldn't let the cards player get up past his knees before he would drill him again. He was playing well until then and I for one lost respect for him on that play.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	He could not have gotten it because of the fighting play, whether he felt or others felt he was justified or not. That disqualified him.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	I think he should have got ejected for his dirty play!|`|zTmliPhEaa	Not with the way he acted near the end.  If he would have manned up and kept his composure, then he could have made another play or two and gotten MVP honors.  But Santonio Holmes did deserve it.  He was the only one able to get past Arizona's defense in those last few minutes.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Harrison had a great game too  it was a close call|`|xLGH4RAXaa	james harrison is a effin tool.  punchin erin francisco  definitely a fag who deserves to die like every other player on the steelers.|`|Fg6iojkUaa	no only other option would be big ben|`|JwWLcBlpaa	yes i think he should of gotn mvp by beatin the crap out of that player jajaja    no     santonio holmes won the game for us so he deserved it!!!    GO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!|`|szkrumAJaa	For that one play, No|`|DafekVxjaa	Are you kidding?  Get the MVP for what?  Beating up the Cardinals player while he was already down.  What a joke.  He should have been ejected from the game, given a stiff fine and be ousted for awhile!  What a great image for all those kids to see.  What the hell was he thinking?  The Cardinals player wasn't even anywhere near the ball.  He needs some anger management classes or something.  I am angry and disappointed.|`|X52KmH3baa	Haters.  Harrison will choke a bird then laugh all the way to the bank.  Please, thumbs down me and see if I care?  You people can get so annoying.  The game is over, let it be.  Your precious Cardinals have another chance next year.  This year just give the Steelers their win and be happy for them that they worked so hard to receive it, and they played the hardest schedule in the NFL, plus had to go through many injuries.  It's honestly really pathetic. You know for a fact that if the Steelers played for your hometown, you would be going nuts right now, just like the Steelers fans are right now. And you call them obnoxious.  Just grow up.|`|jmMXz7yeaa	yah anyone thats beats the crap out of someone THEY SHOULD HAVE A BONUS AND NEW CONTRACT
KdhNCnEjaa	Definetly like Larry Nance. I appreciate Stoudemire and think he is a great player, but he does not have Barkley's heart.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Def like Nance - no one would be like Charles Barkley. Duncan and KG may be better than him and Malone can have a case made for him. But, Barkely is w/o a doubt the best overall talented player @ his position being undersized like that. He is unparalleled by Phoenix Suns now and forever and is the heart of the franchise.|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	close but wrong because nance played defense and could play with his back to the basket .......think shawn kemp in his prime thats a closer match even though kemp was better in the post.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Yes. I agree.  Larry Nance
OfNTLq3Qaa	Umm. No, HBK and Triple H are not even on the same show. HBK is on Raw and Triple H is on Smackdown.   However, they remain friends.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	yes|`|7rpILeYtaa	they occasionally do reform, on special occasions. but no, they are not together|`|RtQaCYUuaa	on special occasions like on the three hour house shows and also the big three tri branded super shows they team up.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	They still do the Suck it thing but they are on different brands and wouldn't be together anyways.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Yes, they are still together. They only tag together when the ratings are low and need a boost or to sell DX merchandise.
R0NfdgzLaa	to add to the answerer above, if you were struck on the pads in india, you started looking for the pavilion.  didn't matter if it pitched outside leg, hit you outside the line, was missing the stumps or you got a massive edge, if they appealed you were in big, big trouble.  it must have been hard to take after seeing a few plumb ones ruled not out when you were fielding.  even the commentators accepted it.  it's just how it was back then.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	No prizes for guessing India.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Let me guess.........INDIA.   The land of match fixing snot rag wearing cry babies?|`|8u8v5y4uaa	thats one ugly looking flag|`|mj1bC73gaa	That would be India ... until the ICC actually took control and MADE them appoint neutral umpires, restrain the crowds in iron cages and ban mirrors that they used to shine in the faces of opposing batsmen.    It was well known that getting an lbw given against an Indian batsman was impossible so don't bother asking.    Lucky it's all changed now.|`|tz7JEqstaa	The Smelly Country.
b7IaDJVTaa	i think they should keep beckam cuz ronaldinho is getting useless so that will be a good deal.|`|u2PYpgOtaa	i would keep both but if i could only keep one i would go with dinho. david beckham is playing rather well but dinho has built up an amazing partnership with the rossoneri players and he is contributing a lot to the team. since day one dinho was playmaking, scoring, and taking beautiful free kicks. i would keep ronaldinho.|`|5h8nyzKSaa	I think it's a good idea.then i could watch his plays every sunday.but i love to watch all of them play together.more than christian ronaldo more than english football.because of david beckham. the man who is full of experiences in playing football.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	I hate Beckham........but the bastard has done good for AC. Dinho is getting back into form and has also contributed to many AC milan wins. Beckham style of play is too plain for my taste.      if you have great players on a team, u will play better. Beckham plays like a$$ for galaxy cuz galaxy is a POS.....now compare Galaxy to AC Milan........... its like comparing Placenta and a filet mignon.|`|3nl5JtpKaa	No man! Milan need pace and Beckham lacks that attribute. Furthermore he is much older than Ronnie.  What's more, Dinho can be brilliant. When (if) he get's back to fitness he can run riot the opposition..  Ronaldinho will be amongst Milan's best by next season.|`|X6aDkjpHaa	no becks is hopeless keep ronaldinho in milan and get rid of becks he is getting old and well he simply cant play|`|A4W6YLS0aa	Beckham is playing excellent. Him and Pato have built a good partnership, but keeping him will be good for Milan. Ronaldinho is very useful too, he scored against Inter and won us the game.
eTUEAWO9aa	Kobe is MVP thats all i got to say|`|7RBdjcl2aa	CP3 for MVP!|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	I still think LeBron James is going to be MVP, about time too. Kobe is in the race for it but I think James deserves it more.|`|UadP6GO8aa	It was the freakin Knicks man get over yourself. The Knicks aren't exactly famous for their defense and Kobe had a great night. I'm not saying he ball hogged or anything I'm just saying he had a great night. Congrats to the Lakers.    But anyway, that was only one game. I still say Lebron James is the real MVP.|`|0JAYAuVXaa	cp3 mvp kobe and lebron are ballhoggers sure theyre good playes but thats hwy othe rplayers in the team wanna get traded|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Dude two of our starters went down (Center Big Z, and Shooting Guard Delonte West) and LeBron averaged 27.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.1 assists per game in the month of January. He had three triple doubles in January, and 7 double doubles.     Now, thats a true MVP.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Anyone who hates Kobe is just jealous.  He is a damn good player and no one can take that away from him.|`|2MdE0Npkaa	i'm starting to think MVP award is a curse. let lebron get it, and when the lakers meet them in the finals, they'll get swept again like last time.|`|HOtYR1ksaa	What do haters have to say?  "Ballhog".    It's all they have to say right now. They try to act like if it is nothing special.|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	Well, I'm not a Kobe hater but since you roped me in.  It wasn't as impressive as LBJ's performance in the Garden last year.  :)|`|xn6vRb6taa	kobe is sick and the best player in basketball right now. lebron is having a great season but i just dont think hes on kobe's level yet|`|DDmFQU7raa	People are going to say he did it because it was against a weak team. If that's the case, why hasn't anyone else bothered doing that?    People are going to say he's a ball hog. If that's the case, why hasn't he scored 61 points EVERY NIGHT?    He's definitely not MVP, at this point. I'm still going to give that to LeBron. He's lead the Cavs to a perfect record at home. Plus, his stats are SICK! If you take LeBron out of the Cavs, then the Cavs wouldn't be worthy of a discussion. LeBron is more valuable to the Cavs then Kobe is to the Lakers.    I don't care why you hate Kobe, but you can't deny how good he was tonight.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	You wanna know why Kobe should be the MVP, cause when he doesn't play the Lakers are lost.    Most Valuable Player = Kobe "Mamba" Bryant....Legend!|`|529b4eb9936aded6e8d2b5fa2e31f186aa	Without Bynum be it good or not Kobe has to take more of the load and he will have to have more MVP caliber performances. Kobe played great today and truly Im confused as to why Kobe scoring 61 a record for one of sports greatest arenas to keep his team afloat is ball hogging when Lebron had 50 last year and no one said much negatively about his performance.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	That was assume!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Listen, the MVP is a jinx, so let La Bron win it. I don't think Kobe cares one bit. He and all of us true Laker fans would much rather have the Ring.|`|Jsvz996Baa	i think he is still arrogant now even more than before
7x4VtGtFaa	Another D word added to Liverpool fans' attributes: DENIAL (delusional is of course first).|`|uXXbegw5aa	I will admit whether or not the season is over after Liverpool face Man United at OT :)|`|bfe20288bf1f5863434f20dd8176ac43aa	The true Liverpool fans wont concede defeat until it's mathematically impossible to catch Utd, mind you I don't see City winning AWAY ?|`|SIKuOevVaa	Pigs do fly.

9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	do people that ask stupid questions really think their smart?|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	The ball was already on the Pittsburgh 1 yard line.    The refs did penalize Pittsburgh because of that infraction. However, since AZ had already downed the punt on the 1 yard line the resulting half the distance to the goal penalty was like 1 foot.    By rights Harrison could have been ejected, but in the way that the game played out it wouldn't have made a difference.|`|AA12103453	Well I'd need to see a CLENCHED fist to know what would be done. That wasn't punching by my definition, but clearly the ref will call a personal foul for the behavior, and SHOULD have. If you want to argue that he should have been ejected for how he handled himself, and so the refs could gain control of the game then I'll say you have an argument.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	They should have called a penalty.|`|cqps4ujeaa	Yes, like someone else said, it WAS a penalty.  The ball was stopped at the one yard line, what are you going to do, put ito out of the endzone?  He will probably not get punished, but any sports fan knows that in the NFC championship game, the late hit put on Warner was worse than the punch.  It was a chippy game and got called, but there was no ejection because he didn't deserve one.|`|BhXMno7faa	Yes, he does call a foul, It would be a unnecessary roughness call.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Patrick he is definately supposed to. If that particular play really bothers you and I know that one you are referring to, write to the NFL and state your grievance. During the Superbowl, they do relax the rules some due to the pressure and hype and competitiveness, but a penalty might have been appropriate to call in that case. I can't definitively say because I haven't seen enough of the replays yet.    However, remember that the rules are relaxed, purposely. But punching is pretty serious. Good luck.|`|yeu09pfOaa	Doesn't seem too|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Yes.  He called a Personal Foul - Unnecessary Roughness which put the ball on the 1 yard line.  A subsequent Holding foul in the end zone led to a Safety.  This forced Pittsburgh to free kick the ball back the Cardinals who, thanks to another Personal Foul, scored a Touchdown putting them ahead in the game by 3 points with less than 3 minutes to go.    Any other questions?|`|UfWx65PTaa	he needs to hear it first|`|2VGbJtnCaa	The cards lost! Let it go!|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	He did.  He should've also thrown the thug out of the game, but at least he called the unnecessary roughness penalty.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	You should be thrown out if you punch a guy.|`|kuifoznbaa	Harrison should have been arrested.|`|HAVLq7IMaa	Yeah, and OH MY GOD, he did! Imagine that. I'm sick of people whining about this. Yeah, I'm a steelers fan and they should have thrown him out for his bad behavior. It was an a** move.    That being said: WE WOULD HAVE STILL WON ANYWAY.    so shut up about this already.|`|0RHmpkhYaa	the ref should have thrown out the player that threw the punch i dont now why they didnt|`|gIRusZKpaa	of course|`|YCwmCDkUaa	It was called a personal foul, tard...

P.S. i like Pete Rose but he made a mistake|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	Think about this.Everybody knows pete rose would be a hof if he didnt gamble on the game.shame,shame.Being in the hof is a status of reputation.Rose has that status.Everybody knows his playing ability is hof material.His numbers speak louder than words,so in our minds he is a hof even thou he officially isnt in it.|`|KWwaxMTPaa	Would everyone please shut the **** up about Obama solving every goddamn sports problem on the planet.

Rose made his choices, Rose signed his acceptance of permanent ineligibility, and Rose in all the years since has done nothing to indicate he has any interest in trying to earn a second chance.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	Obama doesn't have that authority. Bud Selig doesn.    Rose has always shown an interest in himself and never for the game since this whole thing started. There was one cardinal rule about baseball - no gambling - and he broke it, then lied about it constantly ... until he could make money on a book about coming clean.    I have no sympathy for him. We're just not allowing him in the Hall or in a baseball uniform. It's not a death sentence.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Obama can't pardon Rose unless he takes Selig's job.  Rose is banned from baseball, not the United States.  Besides Rose was banned for gambling, isn't Obama against corruption and under-the-table deals?

ebD1plKNaa	When I first started playing, my coach taught us three or four ways to shoot a layup and then made us practice those various ways over and over.  Then he did the same thing with jump shots.  I got very tired of the drills, but when we started playing against each other (and eventually in games), I found out that it was very different when someone was guarding me.      The big difference was I had very little time to do anything.  So, from then on, when I practiced, I did so trying to always imagine that someone was there trying to block my shot.  Then when I played in the games, I did as best as I could to not change the way I shot.    I tried to ignore the defensive players altogether, except for acknowledging where they were in relation to me (after all, you can't run into them and then expect to have enough space to shoot a jump shot).  I practiced throwing the ball off the wall and catching it and shooting it immediately.  Then I learned to pay attention to where a couple of my teammates were at all times.  Then, if I just didn't have the shot, I could easily sling the ball to one of them.    I can't remember ever looking at someone's face.  I tried to look at the entire court and know where all nine other players were and where the basket was without focusing on anything in particular until I had to.  And when I had to, it was either a player I was throwing the ball to, or the goal when I was shooting.      Learn to ignore the people who are playing against you.  I wound up being picked as an All-State point guard by ignoring them.|`|88oSbMbEaa	Make them scared and syke them out then go for the lay up. That help me a lot.|`|GswnLKtQaa	measure the shot blocker before you drive, don't be scared once you are near him for a shot there are two options: 1 is that you can get you lay up in after you measure him. 2: someone is wide open because he came to block you so pass the ball to the opem teammate.    you can also practice high arching layup (tear drop) to avoid shot blockers.|`|E4hFt3RRaa	Just feel like you're the only one out there. Whatever you do don't get an offensive foul those are embarrassing.|`|5IkqBDJ0aa	Listen to 2pac get pumped loose the fear get strong on them don't let the blocker know your scared. Also try a pump fake get them in the air and draw the foul mix things up.. GO HARD OR GO HOME!!
ntLUHiTAaa	Andre Smith, he is big and has great footwork the only problem with him would be lining up against speed rushing DE like dwight freeny or someone like that but whoever gets him could switch him to a guard. I know he will be a good run blocker but don't know about his pass blocking.|`|BwhMgmxFaa	Eugene Monroe|`|Cm86ddQQaa	Andre Smith, with good coaching he can easily be the next Walter Jones or Johnathan Ogden. Jason Smith and Eugene Monroe can be just as good though. They are all top 10 OTs|`|fUUlywctaa	I would say Jason Smith, he's a great offensive lineman.|`|rvl2f6ERaa	andre smith|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Jason Smith good speed,strong,great feet. Andre Smith is more of a RT not a LT and can't handle speed rushers.
KdhNCnEjaa	Projected to go #7 to the Raiders, what about him?<br>  <br>  Hes good|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Im hoping he slides to Minnesota.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	He is fast and has good hands if he runs at least a 43 forty at the combine he will go high in the draft.|`|e6TI1Uvmaa	I'm a die hard Raiders fan, and no offense but I don't think he'll be going to us, but anyway, I predict he'll go top 15 definitely.

FdNYv4D9aa	Honestly, none of this impresses or shocks me at all, for the simple fact that we've ALL seen Vince, Shane, Stephanie, and Linda take stunners, chokeslams, punches, fights, etc. over the years. <br>  <br>  Even Orton's "condition"..I don't know...maybe because I've watched wrestling for 20+ years now and have SEEN hundreds upon hundreds of "psychopatic" characters in ECW, WWE, WCW, TNA, etc....and each of them has TRUELY personified ANY and EVERY definition of "crazy", "disturbed", etc. that I can think of.<br>  <br>  I still can't see Randy Orton as being anywhere near credible of a heel as Chris Jericho. Orton's promos and mic work STILL sounds over (and sometimes UNDER) rehearsed, and he seems like he has to think way too much about what he's gonna say before he says it. I like Orton, and I realize that WWE wants to really push the guy, but week after week when I watch Raw, I just can't help but to see him..his gimmick..(which really AIN'T a gimmick, as he's just...RANDY ORTON..plain and simple)..his look..his music...as nothing beyond BLAND. Legacy..AKA..the Ortonettes...look TERRIBLY weak and needed Manu and Sim to add some diversity, color, strength, muscle, and edginess to the faction. <br>  <br>  I just personally woulda been given Orton's heel push to Jericho, who can convincingly produce excellent mic promos, dynamic and effective heel personas (probably not as some heel portraying a "mental case" like Orton, since Jericho is more of a wise-@ss type of heel..but can STILL "snap" given the right opportunity..which is ALL you need when/if your goal is to take out the McMahon family). Plus, I always felt that Jericho never was PROPERLY given the right heel push the first time around in WWE and he actually also has a score to settle with Hunter, so Jericho and Hunter at Mania woulda (in my opinion) been far better promo/storyline/match wise, instead of another post-Evolution..post Rated-RKO feud between Orton and Hunter.|`|gNeFtZdBaa	RKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>  OOOOOOOOO<br>  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODE|`|VBfhoqS3aa	"He has iED"<br>  <br>  lol...|`|S0u3HKzhaa	He did the same thing after he punted Vince too.They are trying to make it look like he really has that diease he claimed to have a few weeks ago.By making it look like he just lost it and wasn't in the right frame of mind.|`|TzCu3igraa	it's odd. i think wwe are finally tapping into the fact that he gets a lot of cheers for a heel<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgB5NH09J1w5xN.Wb5RevcpMxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220114840AAHmON3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Lv89kHKpaa	Same thing happened when he punted Vince.

xqgE4CrBaa	Hey! Most gyms have different requirements for the levels, so it can vary depending on your gym. Once you get to level 4, there are USAG requirements. Levels 4, 5, and 6 are compulsory. They are given set routines and skills to complete. Once you get to level 7, you are able to make up your own routines and include any skills you want as long as you meet the difficulty requirements.<br>  <br>  (BB) - balance beam<br>  (FX) - floor exercise<br>  (UB) - uneven bars<br>  (V) - vault<br>  <br>  Level 1 - <br>  (BB) walk on tippy toes, kicks<br>  (FX) forward roll, backward roll, cartwheel, bridge, handstand<br>  (V) run and straight jump on mat<br>  (UB) front support, cast<br>  <br>  Level 2 - <br>  (BB) plie jumps, stretch jumps, begin forward roll<br>  (FX) bridge kickover with box help<br>  (V) begin diveroll<br>  (UB) cast, pullover<br>  <br>  Level 3 - <br>  (BB) forward roll, begin handstand, <br>  (FX) handstand forward roll, round-off, begin back handspring with octagon or spotter<br>  (V) begin handstand flatback<br>  (UB) begin back hip circle, begin squat up<br>  <br>  Level 4 -<br>  At most gyms, this is the first competitive level. <br>  (BB) 3/4 handstand, side handstand dismount, straight jump, tuck jump, 90* split leap, 1/2 turn<br>  (FX) round-off back-handspring, handstand forward roll, handstand to bridge kickover, 120* split leap<br>  (V) handstand flatback on tall mat<br>  (UB) pullover, front hip circle, front stride circle(legs split with bar between), undershoot, back hip circle<br>  <br>  Level 5 -<br>  (BB) 3/4 handstand, cartwheel, side handstand twist off dismount, 120* split leap, tuck jump, split jump, 1/2 turn, double pivot turn<br>  (FX) round-off back-handspring back-handspring series, dive roll, front handspring, 180* split leap, straddle jump<br>  (V) front handspring vault(on vault table)<br>  (UB) kip, front hip circle, squat up, jump to high bar, high bar kip, back hip circle, undershoot, 1/2 turn dismount<br>  <br>  Level 6 - <br>  (BB) 180* split leap, tuck jump 120* split jump series, back walkover, handstand to 1/2 turn to side handstand to 1/2 turn to dismount, full turn<br>  (FX) standing back handspring, straddle jump, front flip, front handspring step out to front handspring series, 180* split leap to 120* straddle leap series, full turn, round-off back handspring back flip series<br>  (V) front handspring vault(on vault table)<br>  (UB) kip, free hip circle, baby giant, flyaway<br>  <br>  Level 7 - <br>  This is the first optional level, so the skills included in routines are optional.

Leoc8rlGaa	Hoggard had been struggling for a while to pick up wickets. Yes, he had a poor match at Hamilton, where he took just a single wicket for 151 runs, and the England selectors dropped him, along with Harmless, for that reason. And he could consider himself unlucky to be dropped after just one bad game. <br>  <br>  But the two Tests he played in Sri Lanka on the preceding tour show that his career was starting to become a bit up and down. In the Galle Test, he took six wickets, but at Kandy, he took just one, and went for over a hunded runs. <br>  <br>  In the two Tests he played against the West Indies, he barely bowled at Lord's, so his performance there can be discounted, and five wickets at Chester-le-Street showed that Hoggard was still a decent contributor.<br>  <br>  In the Ashes series of 2006/7, Hoggard's increasing inconsistency was exposed. Only at Adelaide did he provide the wickets and the control England required. In the other matches, he barely took a wicket, and conceded a high volume of runs.<br>  <br>  In his last nine Tests, Hoggard took 26 wickets at a cost of 33.00. Hardly the worst figures ion the world, but England clearly felt they could do better.<br>  <br>  Anderson and Broad were the men who replaced Hoggard and Harmless, although the after-mentioned has somehow managed to persuade the selectors to give him another go.<br>  <br>  Anderson has played 13 Tests since coming back into the side in New Zealand. He has collected 44 wickets at 34.00. Broad has played 12 Tests, taking 34 wickets at 37.02. Harmless since being recalled has played 4 Tests, picking up 9 wickets at 41.11.<br>  <br>  Is Hoggard unlucky to not be in the England team? Well, the stats show that when he was dropped, his performances over a period of time were still better (perhaps only marginally in the case of Anderson) than any of the pace bowlers England have preffered to him since.|`|rmcEFak0aa	cry|`|AA11088802	i think he drops only after 2 bad performances.. and harmi got chance after chance|`|k2y36hPkaa	His dropping from the national side was really dissapointing he had that one bad test in NZ and was never called back... I beleive he himself had said he doesn't see himself in the England side ever again after being left out for the home series against NZ and SA last year...

Rsr8nngWaa	Utah is going to surge and be well above the 8 seed, c'mon. Dallas gets the 8 in the West, Suns are the odd team out.

In the east, I am gonna go with either Nets, Knicks, or the Bulls.
cb2NxPERaa	Who cares?! There are other things people/world should be worrying about. Ask any 20+ year old what they did last weekend.....|`|uJKTR4d2aa	woah i didnt know that. crazy sh*t. sad that a lot of people, even athletes use drugs.|`|DVXypPKgaa	For gods sakes why are people still talking about it?  Im not saying that it was right but he is just a kid he is only 23|`|jvvTybx4aa	I think it's stupid that people are making a big deal of Micheal Phelps doing weed. It's not that big of a deal, seriously. Like he's human and young and im sure the guy worked like crazzyy before the Olympics for that gold meadel so he deserves some type of enjoyment. <br>  <br>  And im sure there are a lot of other celeb's out there who do worser things.|`|tUDOJIFbaa	I like gymnastics better than swimmers. Gymnasts aren't well known worldwide unless it's Nadia Comaneci or Mary Lou Retton. While swimmers are treated like movie stars.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	most celebs do marijuana.|`|KvphGLGVaa	i'm not really that disappointed him him because everybody makes mistakes, no matter who they are or how much money they make or how many gold medals they have. michael phelps is a human and humans make mistakes.<br>  yes, he will probably regret this for the rest of his life, but it's a good learning experience for him.<br>  plus, nobody really knows the whole story behind what michael phelps was doing. there's lack of evidence. nobody has proof that there was or wasn't anything in the bong he was holding.|`|06Rlukp7aa	yes it's immature and dumb, but sometimes I wonder if we make to big a deal out of these things. He didn't hurt anybody and people have to make their own choices. If we make poor decisions becasue a celebrity did then we to accept responsibility for our actions, because what does that say about us?|`|OI8R5KK0aa	Duh! Celebrities do drugs as publicity stunts, to get attention, and some celebs feel like they can't live without drugs.|`|nnlWIAniaa	I'm not surprised or ashamed of Michael Phelps for trying marijuana.<br>  I'm a little shocked he was dumb enough to get photographed holding a bong.|`|jXndHFm3aa	I'm very a lot of kids looked up to him. Now kids see the mistake he did he shouldn't of done that made a lot of us fans of him mad.|`|CgzgTNPAaa	i guess because they're stressed out. yeah im really dissappointed in him because he was my role model.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	no iv hated him for so long. he deserves it. he made the stupid choice to do that. he was so overrated and now hes not|`|D4mwFjwRaa	can u s   uck my dick please ?|`|R41X5wiWaa	We've seen kids disappointed in Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Miley Cyrus or any grown-up child star's misdeeds. Parents buy those posters for them and they hang it up on the wall. <br>  <br>  Michael Phelps was USED to be a child star (or i would say child olympian), he was 15 when he debuted in the olympics. In Fall of 2004, he was arrested for drunk driving in Maryland. Due to his misbehavior, he loses some endorsements.<br>  <br>  Parents will know their kid's vices when they reach 18.|`|93f114bf5dedd99d6243decb11da4e6daa	i look up to him and i think he is kinda hot but thats besides the point and i read the article and it said it was for a photo shoot so i dont know but i am upset that he would do something like that. i thought he was better then that. and yes, all of the stars are being dumb!|`|T2JlDJD7aa	I am. He's the biggest idiot in the world and everyone that's sticking up for him is obviously a stoner who needs their stoned asses killed.

Grow up and get a life.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Are you kidding me? Last year's West Conference title AND those little three rings aren't good enough for you? Shaq didn't get those alone, you know.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	just another HATER|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Too much preassure to the young man.

Wade will take his extra step. AI will palm the ball, and of course it'll rarely get called. If you've got status in the NBA, you can get away with these things, unfortunately.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	No. Are you going to ask another stupid question again? lmao. Go out and do something with your life outside your room for once.

S9ZNGhqyaa	eww yeah, it happens at track practices|`|1JwBoU7Haa	I get it for no reason at all sometimes but I never get it while I run|`|oFePenfVaa	Yes this happens to me when I run to hard or long, especially in cold weather. When it happens I usually stop excercising and drink some water for a bit, and if I feel better afterwards I can go back to running. I only have chest pains if it's really really cold and my body isn't used to the weather yet.|`|2gz6ad5kaa	yah this happens to me. ur dehydrated. if u spit is thick it means ur dehydrated. water is ur friend :)|`|pSymjiFxaa	i get this all the time when i run i hate it|`|W8hvEmFlaa	It's normal..  I don't know about the "stringy stuff" though..|`|jV136uuiaa	It's normal, probably even desired on high intensity threshold runs. It means that your body is unaccustomed to running at whatever pace you were running, so your body could not process all the additional lactic acid building up in your muscles. It builds up in your saliva, causing it to taste like blood. <br>  <br>  See a md about the "clear stringy stuff"|`|0UFDOlZyaa	This happens to me all the time after ive pushed myself to the limit in races.<br>  Though the "stringy stuff" i havent a clue|`|hW9Kv59Iaa	Wait, blood came out of your mouth?|`|93CVX6Jwaa	its normal|`|aKzKHhoYaa	i don;t get it that often but i have on a few occasions. if i were you, i wouldn't worry

Wave your hand around like you have a lasso.<br>  The Kayak: Skate and slide on your butt. Hold your stick in the middle and paddle like a kayak<br>  The Sniper: Skate and slide on your belly, but land so you are facing the goal you just scored on. Hold you stick like a gun, and pretend to snipe the goal<br>  The Sword: Stop as soon as you score, as close to the opposing net or bench. Put your hand on your stick and slide your stick through it, like putting a sword back in its holder.<br>  <br>  Plenty more, just too lazy to write them all.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	Have some respect, you dont showup your competition acting like a hotdog. Thats how people get hurt, physically. Guys that like to show off, usually end up taking a cheap shot, the price they pay for their showmanship. I think you should focus one the games themselves, instead of how to hotdog a goal you MIGHT score.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	How about acting like its not the first or last goal ever scored? Getting to the line with very little extravaganza makes it look like you mean business and not like you've never done it before and probably never do it again.|`|0SDlTGXpaa	throwin your glove up in the air and pretendin your stick is a shot gun and the glove is target. like teemu selanne status.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtk6yVqDy3Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtk6yVqDy...</a>

kfSuRisvaa	if its a regular track 1 lap normal 2nd as fast as you can 3rd normal 4th as fast as you can on the fast laps if you need to slow down or walk do it but dont stop also run more than once a week get into the habit of running and you will look and feel better|`|AA10241450	In order to run faster you will need to practice and run more miles.  For instance running 5K's will bring down your 1mile times as your endurance grows.  Try to keep your training fun since your young.  Practice plenty of form work drills and do skipping since it helps your form.  You can also run intervals which makes your body used to runing at rest pace and trains your heart better than running slow miles.  Good intervals to run would be 400 meters X 6 at mile pace or 200 meters X10 at 400 meter pace.  Good luck!|`|SqX9dGRWaa	u shud practice trying to kick your butt when your running like make your feet go through the full range of motion and just push yourself a bit more like try and do it this way: keep going until u think your gonna give up than a go a minute more always try and go a minute more or even 30 seconds more at a fairly quick speed also remember this quote you cant take the pain home so leave it on the track|`|ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	You can run more often, but that unfortunate truth is that you may just have to grow and mature a bit more before you will keep up with your friends.  I weighed about the same in 7th grade (and so I was even smaller, since I was a boy), and I simply wasn't yet grown enough to keep up.  So do run a few times a week for fun, and when you go to the track start off at a steady pace, and stay active.  When your body catches up, you will KICK BUTT.|`|H16o1MySaa	You have to train. Run a mile 3 or 4 times a week and time yourself. Everytime you need to try to improve your time by I'd say 5-15 seconds. Here's a good site to make a training schedule:<br>  www.runnersworld.com<br>  You the SmartCoach to make a training schedule designed for you.

Air rifles do not count as a firearm and what are you hunting with one anyway, squirrels. Pellet guns usually don't have enough power to take out pidgeons.|`|ui7waO1haa	I'm not sure.

7x4VtGtFaa	Yes. Actually some of them are already knocking on the doors of the first team. Welbeck, Gibson and Possebon have played at one point.<br>  <br>  But you are right to say that perhaps Fergie will continue to mix and match his team for as long as he is managing. It's no secret that while he likes to keep an United core by developing them from the youth academy, he likes to buy the best available player that will suit Man Utd the best.<br>  <br>  So while we have seen the likes of Giggs, Neville bros, Beckham, Butt, he bought the likes of Cantona, Keane, Solksjaer, Yorke, etc, grace United.|`|AA11307432	i think possebon, gibson, simpson and campbell are good<br>  i dont think lee martin or eckersley are good enough for us but thats just my opinion...<br>  i think it was a mistake for fergy to sell chris eagles and kerion richardson but thats also just my opinion<br>  <br>  but yeah its looking good, if only we could get sergio aguero from athletico madrid, giles barnes from derby and bojan from barca, then we would have a squad that would last for at least another 5 years without any buying or selling...<br>  <br>  but hey, thats just my opinion...lol|`|GbyHQQLiaa	I think that Gibson will definitely stay. From what I've seen he has a lot of potential. <br>  <br>  Lee Martin and Richard Eckerlsey are two other players that I could consider staying in the long term.|`|9gnVGV1baa	I only see gibson and possebon staying.|`|n4kp5k6Gaa	i think he'll keep Campbell and Simpson and replace the others but their chances of playin in the 11 starters are week as man u already has stars lyk ronaldo, rooney and so on|`|0HO8sTGeaa	i think they gonna keep Poisson , gibson n simpson... =8~P|`|Xverqpu4aa	I think at least 4 or 5 of those will stay for the long term, no doubt being leant to smaller clubs for experience in the meantime.<br>  <br>  New 'big' players will come, but they will be the minority in comparison.
oAjbBLDpaa	Yes, he does get it too many times but he does well with each title reign. Also, each of them are short reigns, his last two were both about 21 days long.|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Um, not that I'm a big fan of Edge, but Edge's nickname is the Ultimate Opportunist, he sees an opportunity, he grabs it. He's cunning, sly, and manipulative, which are the good ingredients for a great heel. By sneaking in and winning titles, he draws more heat from the fans.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I totally agree with you. he shouldnt have this many titles this soon. i posed a question a few days ago similar to this about the wwe being too TITLE HAPPY. and as i said in my question. does anyone realize he already has more titles then bret hart ever had? thats kinda sad considering what a legend bret is. and edge is going to be around for awhile longer probably so more titles will come.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	edge is a title whore.he won 8 championships in 3 years<br>  and stole another 3 in the last 3 months<br>  <br>  he sleeps with vince mcmahon|`|b1648XnPaa	Look at my name, I think he's a role model the thing is His reigns are way to short for someone who calls therself an oppurtunist.

They should give it a rest.|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is a transitional champion thats how it is suppose to be.
LWOZ9Yqdaa	It depends whether you're more focused on getting bigger/stronger or if you want to be faster/lose weight. If you're trying to lose weight than creatine is not the the answer for you because creatine is basically an energy source in your body that you rely on when you are liting to your limits. It gives you that little extra energy to life more and get stronger. Also if you are already fast than you don't need to lose weight because you want weight as a RB. If you could include a 40 time then you could decide whether you need to focus on losing weight, or getting bigger. <br>  Yeah and like the other guy said if you choose to use it, make sure you drink plenty, actually more then plenty, alot of water.<br>  And yeah if you want to get stronger go ahead and do that. But like that guy said it might be best to wait, because it may stunt your growth but will make you bigger/stronger. Right now I am a freshman 5'11 180 but not fat at all just really lean, and i use creatine because i wont get too much taller haha|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Talk to your coach or trainer first.  You cannot trust most of the stuff on the market because the supplement market is not regulated like regular medicines are.  There are no standardized testing procedures, no government oversight into manufacturing methods, nothing.  It's a snake oil racket.  Lots of lofty claims made but nothing to back it up than some flimsy research paid for by the company who makes the product.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with eating a good diet and working out hard.  Lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and grains don't have side effects.|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	the 2 guys right above me hit it perfect... so what they said and also make sure and drink lots of water, creatine dehydrates you|`|1QP6YFAXaa	I played QB, but I had the same dilemma back in 02! I really think that you should chill until your junior year. I waited until my sophomore year. I was a 5'9 155lb QB! I did get up to 175 when I took it. I think you need to let your body grow naturally before you start taking anything. If you start taking it now, you might be a 5'6 200lb LB as a SENIOR! I know you want results NOW, but trust me, it will only help if you let your body grow first! Just do normal workouts and then as a junior, when your playing the level that really matters, VARSITY, then go ahead if you still feel you need that extra push. But right now, its just too early.

l4WEwTWwaa	A very famous example is the Billy Collins incident in 1983. Billy Collins was a huge boxing prospect that was expected to do great things. But a well known cheating trainer named Panama Lewis put plaster casts in Luis Resto's gloves before the fight. Resto was a bum with 8 losses on his record already but Lewis put the plaster casts in his gloves and removed all the padding in his gloves leaving only hard leather. The impact of the blows detatched Collin's iris and ended his career. It's a shame because he would have gone on to do great things. Resto and Lewis were sent to jail and Collins died in a car crash. He was drinking heavily ever since his boxing career was taken away from him and he would be alive if it wasn't for those two. That's why people are chewing Margarito's *** because he could have killed Miguel Cotto or ended his career.|`|dh48AkbCaa	possibly aaron pryor with "that bottle (his trainer) mixed", although we'll never know for sure.<br>  <br>  mysterious billy smith, who lost 10 fight by disqualification.<br>  <br>  jake lamotta, who threw his 1947 fight with billy fox.<br>  <br>  mike tyson, who, not only chewed evander holyfield's ears, but was prone to throwing elbows as well (see his fight with pinklon thomas, and thomas' trainer angelo dundee's reaction in between the 1st and 2nd rounds).|`|ebfb6f74ff2342b199ea5099662b442eaa	Moseley, Pazienza, Margarito, Luis somebody...Panama Lewis was removing the stuffing from his gloves between rounds...some claim Sharkey took a dive against Carnera, some claim Dempsey, Duran thumbed Davey Moore, intentionally and directly in the eye in their fight.

Ekx7G30jaa	Yes, they are.  In fact, I am going to go so far as to say that they're stupid.  I question the legality of some of them.  <br>  <br>  In order to buy a handgun, you have to obtain a California Handgun Safety Certificate.  This involves passing a written test and an actual demonstration of how to load and unload a handgun, as well as locking it. By the way, it's not free.  They want 25 bones from you for this.  What I don't like is that we're paying for something that's a right guaranteed by the Constitution.  The state views it as a privilege.   <br>  <br>  Check out these two sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/hscinfo.php" rel="nofollow">http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/hscinfo.php</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/hscsg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/hscs...</a><br>  <br>  The study guide will tell you all about safety and how to load and unload the various types of firearms. <br>  <br>  When you buy a handgun, you're going to have to fill out a form that will want your biographical information.  You'll need your HSC certificate, your driver's license and a recent utility bill, rent payment or mortgage payment to provide more verification that you live in the state.  <br>  <br>  You can only purchase one new handgun every 30 days, another ridiculous regulation.  This is all covered in the study guide.  I think it was on the exam too.  <br>  <br>  If you're going to buy, buy now before Obama takes all the handguns away.  He's as anti-gun as they come.  Don't believe a word he says.  He's voted no on every pro-gun legislation while a senator in Illinois.|`|qnI1BfoHaa	yea i think california has the most strict gun laws in the country. one day they'll probably outlaw all guns.|`|HJTs6qppaa	Absolutely, and it's only going to get worse.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Yes and no.  You can get anything you want, but it has to be a legal firearm in the state.  For long guns, that means not "assault" weapons.  Handguns have to either be on a list of legal guns with the state, or be private party transfers.  For long guns, you must be at least 18.  For handguns you must be at least 21, and pass a handgun safety test to get your handgun safety certificate.  The test is along the lines of "What is your name?" and "Which end do the bullets come out of?".  That is all that you need to do to purchase firearms here.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	for sure, you can only buy one handgun per month. but you can buy one hundred shotguns or rifles per month.
z58NVkOnaa	For you to be able to connect and send a small round object that far is actually an amazing feat.<br>  <br>  Think of driving as this...you want to throw a ball...the driver head is your hand, and the shaft is the arm...if your shaft/arm is too stiff for the speed of your swing/throw, then you will lose distance...however, if your arm is flexable and your shaft bends with your swing, you will be able to throw the ball a lot farther.<br>  <br>  No matter what anyone says...to be able to hit a golf ball, that in itself takes skill...the harder your try to hit the ball, the shorter the distance it will go...(for now) the easier you swing, and let the natural motion of your swing take effect, the farther it will fly.  Try it, I believe that you will enjoy your time at the range...and congrats on your distance.|`|as0xwRRzaa	To be completely honest it depends on how long you have been playinh. Some people also have natural swings. I am 15 and about 5'11'' and can hit the ball about 250-260 on average but I have been playing since I was 5 or 6 so that makes a huge differnce. Keep practicing and it will drastically improve. Trust me.|`|sMjndu1Eaa	Well I just turned 15 years old and I can hit past 200 yards on the driving range with my driver at my local golf club. If I can, I mean you can too.. So 200 yards is a good driving distance, you can do it, just practise alot and play alot of golf.|`|sBrummATaa	thats pretty good if its your first time hitting a golf ball. i would assume your hitting a driver. i usually hit my driver 230-250, 250 if i hit it pure, but that usually dont happen|`|o7E9LxV8aa	at that age that good
a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	How old are you and what is your current fitness level also what is your diet like.<br>   Sorry I know this isn't an answer<br>    You should start seeing something now, It is difficult to see improvement on yourself so ask a trusted friend (be care full who you ask as you don't want to look silly or worse vain.)Expect progress to be slow and steady if you eat well and exercise regularly. Take picts in the mirror (same pose always) and you will notice the difference. Good Luck|`|s9w9Rbkqaa	go to the gym
pANpZ3vaaa	I've also been a huge steeler fan and lived in Pittsburgh from 1992-2002, since then I moved to Tennessee in 2002, where they really like the Colts, Titans, and others...<br>  <br>  I had a hard time trying to find some friends that keep up with the steelers, but finally found out that some friends do!<br>  <br>  Anyways I threw superbowl parties in 2005 and 2008 when the Steelers played and if you weren't a Steeler fan, I made them pay twice the entrance fee!

QTd8MVDjaa	Tippmann doesn't make an A5 with no cyclone, but there are a few different ones that are based on the A5. It isn't much different than the Tippmann 98 Custom. But if you like the look of the A5 more, look at the BT BT-4. Its kinda like an A5 and a 98 put together, without the cyclone. If you can find one, the PCS US5 looks exactly like an A5 without the cyclone, but it isn't as good and doesn't have as many upgrades as a BT-4. I'd go with the BT-4 Combat. It doesn't look exactly like the A5, but it's very close and it's a solid gun. A new barrel would be a good first upgrade.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Nick nailed it.  Just to add, for the BT's, they make a halo b hopper that side mounts just like the cyclone.  I wish I could get one to fit my x7.  I love tippmann guns, but like you, I have my doubts on the cyclone.  It just uses to much co2 I think.  I loved my Halo B with a ripdrive, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make to go with the x7.

aKzKHhoYaa	i agree|`|0pXBYo4paa	Smoking irritates your respiratory tract. When you ran, the heavy breathing irritated it further and pushed things over the edge. Basically, your throat and bronchial tubes just kind of freaked out from all the abuse. You don't have real asthma, just your lungs are just kind of tore up from smoking.<br>  <br>  If you quit smoking now and continue working out, it will go away. The irritation will heal and all the crud eventually clears out. You can't smoke in basic anyways and if you wait till the last minute, nicotine cravings will make things really suck there...as if basic isn't hard enough to begin with.|`|UCNPFSw8aa	It really sounds like it's a combination of your body not being used to working out that much, and your body detoxing. This same thing happened to me. I too leave for Basic Training on March 24 (Air Force), and I now find myself with one month to get ready!! Feel free to email me if you have questions. I went through the smoking thing (I haven't had a ciggy in 2 months! Damn I miss it!) and I recently went to a gym on base, and a trainer set out a work-out routine for me that should help get me ready in a month. I'm more than happy to share it with you if you like.
gC7OMToraa	Smoking weed didn't help him win. I have never been a "die hard" Michael Phelps fan so I'm not "defending" him, but the media should just shut up about this. People are talking about how they don't understand how he could've done this, but it's simple. He's human and so are they. Letting something like pot change your opinion of him is just stupid and judgemental. No matter what he's still an amazing athlete and smoking weed hasn't changed that.|`|pXhoYvzkaa	the rumors are a lie!!|`|0OERgH7taa	how would smoking we need help him win in the olympics, and no they wont be taken away becuase it didnt affect the olympics|`|p73sRHztaa	won't loose his medals and he will swim again... and it's probably not the first time he smoked pot was I the only one who saw SNL when he hosted?!?!? If he was sober he should admit that he was high. He was awful!!!|`|175f31c99576af42d5ff8e3e686de0eaaa	The Olympics officials do complete blood tests. They'd surely have found something if it were in his system.     Plus, weed is not a performance enhancer, but a relaxant. He'd have been relaxing by the pool with his bag o' Doritos and a Corona if he were high.

br1kwegaaa	If you noted, MSU moved down to  13 in the AP poll.  Losing at home vs. Northwestern and Penn State can't be encouraging.  But the Penn St. loss was on Super Bowl Sunday, so I don't think many voters were focused on that game.  MSU is 5-0 on the road in Big 10 play and they should be ranked higher than  19 Minnesota, who they beat up on the road earlier this season.  (Note: I think the Gophers are overrated, but that is for another time).  MSU did beat  16 Texas on the road earlier this season and should not slip below them in the rankings.      I will call MSU  15 for now as of 2/3/09.  But I am writing this knowing they have yet to play Purdue this season and still have to play at Michigan and at Illinois.
vJj6lo4faa	So, the 7th ball wouldnt be the 8-ball right? So, he potted the 7th ball and supposed to pot the 8-ball next, but he scratched.  its not a loss, its just a foul.  The opponent then will continue with the cue ball in hand.    Its not a loss, just a foul.  It will only be a loss if the player pots the 8-ball and at the same time scratched.    hope it helped!|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Loss no, foul yes. Respot the black and white goes to the semi-circle for the next player.|`|y5TTkgFYaa	Zack is right, BCA rules follow World Standardized rules.  It is never a loss to scratch unless you also pocket the 8 ball or jump it off the table.|`|zFTSg47waa	A player is not "on the black ball" until the shot where he pocketed his 7th ball is completed, that is, all the balls must have stopped moving. So it's just a typical scratch and the opponent gets ball in hand.    In order to lose while on the black, the black must be pocketed and the cue ball must scratch on the same shot.

UQLNP6iyaa	In a young country, any sport which has been played competitively for over 100 years and played profesionally for over 85 years carries huge cultural significance.    The Superbowl carries more cultural impact because, unlike other almost uniquely American sports (Basketball, Ice Hockey, Baseball) it is the game where the championship is won all at once. In the other sports each team gets 7 games (or 6 second chances) to eke out the win. The Superbowl has seen bad games when times were good and good games (like Sunday) when times are bad. Many Americans celebrate Super Bowl Sunday as a holiday and, with the exception of July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas/Hanukkah and New Years Eve, in a manner more in keeping with the event of the day than any other holiday.    Therefore, one can argue that the Super Bowl relates almost intrinsically to the cultural heritage of the United States.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	I think that the Super Bowl's relationship to American cultural heritage is somewhat over-stated. NFL Football football is by far the most popular sport in America, and as a result the SB. which is only 43 years old, is going to be huge.    I would say that the Superbowl has a very limited relationship to US cultural heritage, but football itself (HS, collegiate & pro) has a much more significant part in US cultural heritage.|`|1Byis7Flaa	As you could see in the Super Bowl anything can happen.  Penalties happen on every play, but don't get called on every play.  There are often mistakes in which pentalties are called.  The players are paid millions of dollars, do they still get corrupt and take bribes?    Just like the USA a capitalist country with lots of quiet corruption|`|AA11593134	SuperBowl is the most watched event in the USA. I think most household watch the SuperBowl on TV every year. Other than the Olympics and the World Cup (Soccer), it is the most watched even in the world as well.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Many people in America love to party, watch football, drink beer, eat fatty/fried foods, and argue about who's city is the best. The Super Bowl brings all of that together in the ultimate celebration of American culture.|`|UxooffHZaa	One of the ESPN personalities, I think maybe Sal Paolantonio, recently wrote a footbal history of America, connecting the sociological importance of football with American culture.     Football in America and it's rise has a lot more to do with it's play in collegeate sports than NFL. The NFL, and the Super Bowl is just the greatest expression of Americanism in sports. One game, do or die. A huge event that is not just sports, but music, fireworks and commercials. Football is a made for TV sports, with huddles that last the perfect length for quick commercials. It's violent, but people wear protective uniforms to keep injuries to a minimum. It's "on the clock" like most American workers. There are no judges, you either win or not. You're either in the end zone or not.

5e8d9d565c4a1b022e1a499cb8fb71f8aa	Hi there.<br>  <br>  I think this is a good point as, being a football fan, I dislike the fact that a lot of top clubs in England are not giving young English players a chance. But a key point in the game today is the time and support managers are given to make things work. I can sympathise with managers as they are under a lot of pressure to deliver (Tony Adams and Phil Scolari was given the boot recently!) from chairmen, the board as well as fans. So, given the choice of either bringing in a player for a few million who has the desired level of ability or gambling on a youngster who'd take several seasons to 'blood', it's easy to see why most take this route.<br>  <br>  Now, whether a British spine is needed in a team in order to be successful in the Premier League is debatable. If by success you mean in relative to the ambitions of he club, Man Utd woiuld be a good example. Alex Ferguson's Man Utd have won a number of titles with teams that tend to feature 4-5 british players or more regularly playing in a season. However, Chelsea did manage to win the title with only John Terry, Joe Cole and Frank Lampard regularly featuring as their British players.<br>  <br>  Credit has to be given to Villa (and Martin O'Neill in particular) for how well they've played this season and by their standards have been an out and out success. But Liverpool (my club of choice....and stress!) have been very inconsistent in comparison, feature very few british players (Gerrard, Carragher and Pennant who's on loan to Portsmoth), have a Spanish coach and find themselves a just above Aston ViIla In the league.<br>  <br>  To be fair to Arsene Wenger though, when his team are on form there are very few that can compare and they play the game as its meant to be played, If they still had a Viera type figure in the squad, maybe they'd have been pushing for the title this year.|`|AA11901745	Hang on how many of the current top four have a british spine hmm liverpool carragher gerrard oh thats one. Man U ferdinand carrick rooney scholes (many to choose from) so two then, but hang on how about chelsea  with Terry and Lampard. shall we stop at 3 then well villa makes it four doesn't it|`|I5Mr8mXIaa	i agree he is a good manager but he should focus more on the yung english talent cuz we all no hes good at spottin yung foren talent but gettin yung players from the teams nation wud be better and i wud think probly cheeper|`|ebee988c7e88e57112c395fec80ac354aa	Martin O'Neill is Northern Irish not Scottish|`|exARv7Bmaa	Arsene Wegner is too set in his ways to accept anything as forward thinking as that....a bit of British steel and passion would have seen the Gunners with a few more trophies in the cupboard by now.|`|AA12370193	English spine like who? The better English players are at the other top clubs because their prices are beyond Arsenal's. Villa has no great English players that REALLY put them where they are, they're there simply due to an abundance of luck unseen at Arsenal.<br>  Unless you're saying its English players that bring luck (a la Gerrard)? But its a shame they can't replicate that luck on the international field.<br>  <br>  Villa, is really no club to look up to. There's nothing I can look at on them and be jealous of any success or such.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	we barley had any english man whe we went unbeaten,so your point is?<br>  <br>  <br>  i know martin o'neil from scotland and it's not the british players,thats not why there up there. he's a good manger and knows how to get the best out of players. very under-rated manager.<br>  <br>  he could of got his celtic team challenging for the PL if rangers and celtiv were aloud in the PL then.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	Absolute rubbish!!!

cOPCNP7Laa	Firstly no more 4-3-3 but get back to the WC 06 formation (4-3-1-2). Then don't play both De Rossi and Pirlo together. They are the same case as Lampard and Gerrard. They cancel each other out as they effectively play the same position. Have Gattuso hold the defense and stop calling up Montolivo and Pepe. Then play Giuseppe Rossi as your main striker partnered by Toni/Gilardino whilst having Del Piero or Cassano playing as that player linking the mid with the attack, right behind the two strikers. Have Di Natale always on the bench to replace Rossi when needed and Perrotta ont eh other flank parallel to Camoranesi. Then the problems would be sorted with a strong midfield, good fantasy behind the strikers and both a fast winger/striker and a solid tall guy to head the balls in and win high and long balls.<br>  <br>  Ideal formation: Buffon - Grosso, Cannavaro, Chiellini, Zambrotta - Gattuso, De Rossi/Pirlo, Perrotta & Camoranesi - Del Piero/Cassano - Toni (Gila sub) G Rossi (Di Natale sub)|`|oNR7il8baa	Get some Spaniards/ Argentinians DUH!! <br>  <br>  Look at Camoranesi =]<br>  <br>  Add Brazilians too Sorry|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Their attack is already great,....<br>  <br>  <br>  Look at Pirlo, Del Piero, Gilardino, etc.. etc....<br>  <br>  They have lots of talent.... <br>  <br>  and I'm sure they'll do great in the next World Cup :)|`|7VwcvLTxaa	LOL @ Marco!!!

6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	It is not too late to fine Santonio Holmes for excessive celebration after the TD when he did his homage to LeBron James (using the ball as a prop is an "automatic" foul for excessive celebration).<br>  <br>  However, by fining Holmes, this is unrefutable proof that the referees blew the call by not calling the foul.  ALL excessive celebrations are penalties worth 15 yards assessed on the ensuing kickoff.  Since the NFL is fining Holmes for his actions, the NFL is acknowledging that his end zone antics were cause for a penalty (excessive celebrations are personal fouls that also come with fines after the game) that did not get called by the referees.|`|d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	IT IS LATE! It is so ******* stupid and ridiculous for leagues like the NBA and the NFL to fine players ridiculous amounts for performing harmless TD celebrations! The higher ups in these leagues are trying to do nothing more than take the FUN out of playing sports! Now don't get me wrong. I agree there are some celebrations that, over the years, didn't need to take place (like T.O.'s running to the Dallas Cowboys logo when he played with the 49ers), but there's no real need to fine Santonio Holmes for imitating LeBron James in the Super Bowl. What is that? It's getting so that you can't do anything in sports anymore! As long as you're entertaining the fans who come to watch the games, who cares?<br>  <br>  But in reality, if I were him, I wouldn't worry too much about it because leagues like the NFL and NBA can fine their athletes all they want for bullshit like this, but as long as the athletes have the $$$ to pay the fines, it doesn't matter!|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	No, he got what he deserved.  A fine, a ring, and a ball to keep as a trophy.<br>  <br>  Yes, the officials missed it.  Quite understandable that there is not one official who stare at a guy who makes TD until he's back on his bench.  The action took place at least 30 seconds after the TD was caught and did not involve any players from the other team.  Most officials are going to be setting up the next play by then.|`|e6TI1Uvmaa	I think the refs should have penalized him at the Super Bowl. That would have given the Cardinals better field position and possibly the win. The refs totally gave that game to the Steelers.|`|kzYdVfifaa	No it's not too late, It's against the rules and shouldnt' be done. Excessive Celebration leads to fines|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	'Bout time. Now they should take Get the two teams together and restart the game from the 15 yd. penalty with whatever time was left on the clock, if the Cards can score the Steelers have to give the trophy to the Cards if not they get to keep it.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	He used the football as a prop.  Definitely and clearly a violation.|`|rDmlKoRQaa	It's way too late, but it was done intentionally. The NFL wanted to give time for people to cool down after the superbowl. By fining Holmes they would have confirmed that a flag should have been thrown that could have potentially changed the game. <br>  <br>  The last thing the NFL needs to do is admit to poor officiating again this season. We the public take care of that for them. They just tried to avoid as much controversy as possible.|`|2CuuIT70aa	They should fine Larry Fitzgerald for imitating Shaquille O'Neal.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	It's was MJ who started it, quit the LBJ thing.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	now the NFL must be "crying" about it to ha
tPaRZod9aa	I agree. Rice just dominated the game. I remember back in the 80's and I saw the 49ers on our shcedule, I automatically put a loss on our record just because our secondary was too bad for that combo.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	I think Larry Fitzgerald has the potential to be one of the greats, but I don't think you can say hes up there with Jerry Rice.<br>  <br>  This is the kind of conversation people should be having 10 years from now when Larry Fitzgerald's carree is coming to an end.|`|KTp27Fokaa	I say they are stupid.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	thts just crazy<br>  this is his first season being the noticed<br>  ive loved the guy for ever and now everyone thinks hes the best outta no where?<br>  get real<br>  hes not the best!<br>  just bc he did goood this season doesnt mean hes the best ever<br>  altho ive liked ever since he came to the nfl i would have to say he will be good but not the best|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I want to wait and see how he does without Kurt Warner and Anquan Boldin there to help. Without Boldin defenses will be able to focus 100% on him.<br>  <br>  He will never be the greatest.|`|JTSNljLhaa	Rice is the greatest of all time..i wouldnt put Fitz over Rice or Moss yet|`|Lcnc8952aa	i think that the people|`|AOA8TJraaa	Larry Fitzgerald, outstanding leaper, exeptional speed for a wide reciever, great young superstar, great awareness.It's easy to say Fitzgerald is right now. Nobody was talking about this subject before the playoffs. Let me be clear: I think Fitzgerald is a very good receiver and certainly one of the best. But I think that Randy Moss is the best receiver. You can't stick to Moss one-on-one.<br>  <br>  I do remember Rodney Harrison playing against Fitzgerald during his rookie season. I was impressed of Fitzgerald, for a big man, he was very athletic, very quick. And he ran really good routes. He's really good at catching the ball at its highest point. He has all of the small little habits that make a receiver really good.<br>  <br>  Fitzgerald has been really good this postseason, having the best postseason of anybody in NFL history. But right now, I think that guys like Moss, Andre Johnson and even Chad Johnson are among the best. That's not to say that Fitzgerald isn't in their class, because he is. I want to see him do it consistently along with guys like Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.<br>  <br>  If he does this next year, then yes, I think he could be the best.I think that Larry Fitzgerald and Andre Johnson are the two best young receivers in the game.He has an all-planet quarterback throwing him the ball.But we can't get too "fast food" about it -- don't make a snap decision about it just because it was the playoffs. We need to slow down.His size is what really sets him apart. He has that great size like a lot of the other top receivers -- Terrell Owens, Randy Moss and Plaxico Burress. Those guys are freaks. They all have that size to make mismatches with defensive backs. Fitzgerald is also good at attacking the football -- fighting off the other guys to make the play.|`|AA12375576	I think he has the potential to be the greatest.  He still has alot of years to play to catch the likes of Jerry Rice.  In todays game it will be hard for him to stay healthy and productive like Jerry did.  Jerry also had very good QB's for most of his career with Montana and Young.  If Leinhart works out Fitz will continue to be productive but if Leinhart ends up being a bust and it takes the franchise a few years to find a solid QB he will have a really hard time putting up Jerry-like numbers.|`|AA10896470	Greatest WR of his era can be more suiting for him. He plays in an era where the NFL basically pampers the offensive side of the ball (fining players for hits is BS) whereas the players in the past were in a much tougher game.

If you know the year, help me out.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS, I could go to the Left Field Bleachers and pull Steve Bartman by the ears when he tried going after the ball in the 8th inning.|`|1668e512ad95a12828036de52cff9631aa	i would travel to whever it is the Mets win their next World Series.<br>  <br>  So apprently I'm gonna travel to October 2009!!!

Tony M.|`|Ey4puW2Kaa	I agree with MrDurden20, I would like to see Babe Ruth "call his shot". There has so much controversy whether he really called it... That would be fun to see.
N3OuAcx3aa	Yes, Dwyane Wade is a very good franchise player. He has all the skills of LeBron and Kobe. He is underrated and people don't see that four years at Marquette gives him betterknowledge about basketball than LeBron. Dwyane should have received this coveted award in 2006, when his team won the NBA championship. Wade has proven himself that he is worth it, but all you crazy fans out there must believe commercials and dunks makes a player. This is not to criticize them, but it is to teach them that this is basketball not a Nike Shoe commercial.|`|YJcYBNv0aa	This year's MVP race might be the tightest in a LONG time. You have Kobe, LeBron, D-Wade, D-How and CP3. This is my prediction:<br>  <br>  1. LeBron<br>  2. Kobe<br>  3. D-Wade<br>  4. CP3<br>  5. D-How<br>  <br>  Honestly, even if the Heat win 50 games this season Jermaine O'Neal will be given credit and D-Wade might be bumped up to the 2nd spot but it looks like they will barely be able to crack the top 4 in the East, and considering the fact that it's the East and they can't even be a Top 4 team don't expect D-Wade to win.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	2005 - 2006<br>  <br>  LeBron had 31.4ppg 7rpg 6.6apg<br>  <br>  Cavs were 50 - 32, and he didn't win MVP<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  D-Wade would certainly be worthy, but I'm not sure what the true definition of the MVP is anymore.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	NAH SINCE LEBRON IS THE NBA'SPUSSY BOY THEY'LL GIVE IT TO HIM<br>  <br>  <br>  WADE>LEBRON<KOBE<WADE|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yeah I think he should because he is leading the NBA <br>  in scoring.|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	no, i dont think he has been doing much for the heat this year.|`|X1f4icumaa	YES!!!!!BUT IT WONT HAPPEN BUT I WANT IT TO!|`|2IwOsywiaa	yes i think he now mvp|`|OnpLn838aa	no one should get that if you are a bad father and dont take care of your kids|`|21J0IIZbaa	He would be talked about more.  The MVP race is between Bryant and James.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i think he should get the mvp award go wade he is gonna win for sure i can tell you that|`|FUoKu13Daa	If kobe and LBJ was not playing as well as they are and if their teams was hovering around 50 wins too then yes I would say D-wade should get it <br>  <br>  But the fact that Cavs and the Lakers have two of the best records of the league and they are both playing at a high level one of them will most likely get it<br>  <br>  Throuhout history the MVP weighs heavily on a team success so a 50 wins team and their star has a chance of winning it but when you have two players and actually 3 with Dwight Howard playing well too and their teams are going to be 60 plus wins then the MVP usually goes with the person on those teams.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	He's turned this team around greatly.  After the embarassing year the Heat had last year, this is a major improvement.  I would be surprised if the Heat didn't make the playoffs.  But I don't think DWade will win MVP even though he deserves.  Everyone is concentrating on LeBron and Kobe.|`|csKyqot0aa	No. LeBron will get MVP.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	thats a tough question.......<br>  depends on the other team records of lebron and kobe but he would be a strong candidate
KdhNCnEjaa	No, there should not be an asterisk. Today's shooters took a legitimate approach to the game, did everything legally, and succeeded. They should not be punished for playing the game within the rules.|`|BiMkowVMaa	defensive 3 second rule was introduced in 1966. Hand checking doesn't give you an advantage as Jordan has stated himself and tick tack fouls have always been a part of the league based on the referee crew.<br>  <br>  It's been stated by players and coaches that there is more defense and defensive sets now then ever before.<br>  <br>  You video examples are useless and spliced together improperly to give your argument any support.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I don"t know if their should be an asterisk but the hand check rule is big and the def 3 sec rule is big,<br>  <br>  The NBA implement these thing to increase the score of the games and so today players do have a little advantage from the 90s.
AA11229410	I have read in more than one place that it will be three or a few years.  I have seen both stated.  I can see someones point about the loss of character but it's just about time to do it anyway.  I don't know if you can ever really fix turn four.  Coming out of four is where all the demons live.  They come out of that tunnel and slam the drivers in the wall on their way out.|`|2Bl7zOO4aa	It's going to happen in 2011. I agree. It will make racing better and it's going to be like talledega. They will also make the track 2 feet wider.|`|muc8sq9naa	Maybe it will help the tire problem????  If it doesn't then I don't see the point in re-ppaving.  I am all for it.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|mIdcJEJNaa	They said they planned to repave the track in 2012..|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I don't like the idea although I do understand you do have to occassionally repave.  It will just take some of the character out of the place.  I don't want it to be so smooth that a premium is taken of handling.  Daytona is a ten times better track than 'Dega for this reason.  I don't want them to race at Daytona the way they do at 'Dega.  Talladega is easily my least favorite track.  Sorry, but I just don't get it I guess. : /|`|sXMrY3uwaa	Disagree, Going to ruin Daytona... Since when are these drivers being pansies and can't drive on a bumpy track? For me, thats what makes Daytona so great, watching them control those cars bouncing around like that. This is a mans sport, screw smoothness!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=3899797" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup...</a><br>  <br>  And it won't be after July, It's going to be in 3 years according to ESPN.com|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	I think that it will kind of mess the track up.That's what is so great about Daytona.Also look at the other tracks that have been re-paved.Bristol isn't the same Bristol it used to be.      :{|`|FtkoBEVpaa	They need to do something about all the bumps in the corners, the only thing I worry about is tire wear on new pavement.|`|icTRTBAraa	It was looking kind of bad last week maybe a good repaving will help the tire situation there.|`|Vfm7w7nNaa	They should make a dirt track out of it.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	I believe it would make better racing . So i agree|`|bTZGob8qaa	I think it will be in three years, that's what I've heard. After seeing Talladega, I'm all for it!|`|bBFiiSG2aa	Agree. Daytona is very bumpy and repaving would improve the racing. The drivers are just hanging on to the car in the bumps, so a smoother track would help. This possibly would help the tire wear also|`|c3tADklmaa	So the bumps at 3 and 4 will be gone. Which means less Big Ones. So I say disagree for this one.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	its about time.. yes more than likely after the July race it will be done
CijPDCv1aa	ASK YOUR GROUP, because you do whatever you need to do to help the stunt stay in the air<br>  <br>  like if your bases tell you that they need help lifting the up the stunt, you should hold their wrists. <br>  <br>  but if the flyer is semi- new, or uncomfortable with flying, you should probably hold ontoher calves, or ankles|`|PxtmMAMnaa	a front is unnecessary, but when they are there your job is to help out the stunt as much as possible. I would ask the bases what they prefer, usually fronts hold the bases wrists and help pull up.

IWM1khX7aa	Bojan- The Youngest of the group, but he's amazing for his age.  He scored 10 goals last season at 17 years old.  He will be the next great striker for Barcelona and Spain.<br>  <br>  Kun- The oldest of the group, but he's at Atletico and his talent will be overshadowed by Messi when he gets older<br>  <br>  Pato- 11 goals this season for Milan and in the last 6 games he has scored a goal, and he is compared to someone like Pele or Ronaldo.  He will be the best out of this group.<br>  <br>  Gio- Has tremendous talent and he's compared to Ronaldinho, but he is stinking at Tottenham.  He still has a chance to become a great player though, and he just needs to be better in Mexican internationals.<br>  <br>  1. Pato- Will become one of the best strikers to ever play football.<br>  2. Bojan- Will become one of the best strikers to ever play football.<br>  3. Gio- Will be like Ronaldinho...At a young age, he's one of the best but at an old age, he sucks.<br>  4. Kun- I don't know how much longer his fame will last since he is at Atletico and in the shadows of Messi.|`|YETEt0Dqaa	I think Dos Santos could be quality but needs to move away from spurs!<br>  he could be the new ronaldinho<br>  <br>  but i reckon pato will have the best career, he is still only 19 and plays nearly every game!|`|jLRpCt03aa	I dont think Kun should even be in that List, he's been playing professionally for a long time. But anyway, I like Bojan and Dos Santos.|`|yVMGqyIwaa	Definitely Pato<br>  no one on that list compares to his awesome talent|`|VDh1fcGIaa	The best out of all of them will end up being Pato followed by Bojan, then Kun.|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Mr. Dos Santos is my fave<br>  The best will definitely be Kun|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Out of the above players Pato is one of the youngest yet the furthest ahead...|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I think Kun is the most complete  player|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Gio Arriba Mexico y Arriba El America|`|oNR7il8baa	It's all About Kun <br>  <br>  I see Bojan getting really good. And Pato is already getting there|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Pato and Bojan are at the same age. I think they have a great future ahead of them. So yeah I have to say them two.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Its between Kun and Bojan I think.<br>  <br>  lol ducky
RLQdhFWXaa	Probably only going to be able to watch the Sprint Cup race this weekend.   My grandsons birthday is this weekend, we are going to be having a BBQue and celebrating.  <br>  <br>  Go Junior!!!!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I'll be watching all three!!<br>  <br>  I love the Fontana track, I know it's not much of a fan favorite, but it's always appealed to me for some reason...not sure why exactly, but I do love it!!<br>  <br>  Good luck to everyone's drivers....and go KB!!|`|c3tADklmaa	I watch the Truck and the Cup every weekend if they trucks raced. I don't like the Nationwide that much due to the fact of double-duty drivers.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Maybe not the truck race this weekend....but still agonna watch the Nationwide and Sprint. You bet i am excited!!|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I'll be on the edge of my seat, watching the Cup race Sunday. I got money on Carl Edwards to finish better than the #18, #24, #48 and #14, and if the #1 car wins at Fontana I don't care how much money I lose. I'll be watching the cup race at home. Safe and sober. I'll probably be the only NASCAR fan drinking hot tea while watching the race. Now all I have to do is figure out what i'm going to have for snacks.|`|muc8sq9naa	I will be watching every race, practice, qualifying and trackside program on.  My tv will be on Speed or ESPN all weekend.  I just hope it doesn't rain for the race on Sunday.  We are expecting rain in the Central Valley here in Cali on Sunday, I just hope it doesn't hit the southern part of the state!  We don't need another rained out race!<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|7RUMbREoaa	Yes,I will be watching all three.I hope the Cup race is better this week.It is at CaliBOREnia,though.The only time I usually like Caifornia is when Jimmie is dominating it(instead of someone else because some ALWAYS dominates and gets like a half-lap lead) and wins.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	You better believe it I am.I got the "honey-do's" done and Im ready to park my wore out back in my easy chair and relax all weekend. :)<br>  <br>  I will watch all three as well. Go Kurt! Starting 4th! Yeee-Haww!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Absolutely............I usually only watch the Sprint Cup but occasionally the Nationwide Series.|`|Uaj4B84iaa	I don't like either CA tracks but as long as they're racing, I'll watch!|`|OFFjKX72aa	You read my mind, Storm Bandit. Let's get ready to go racin'!!!|`|Zd6q5s2Kaa	nope, not really my thing! But have fun!|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I'm always excited for Fontana, it's basically Jimmie's home track and he always does well there.  A lot of people don't like it but I prefer it to any of the restrictor plate races.  Let's hope the weather holds out and we don't have all the delays and drama like we did a year ago.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	This is week 1 of the season as far as I'm concerned even though my favorite driver won last week.  The next three races, all fast downforce tracks, will really go a long way in telling us who the real players will be this year.|`|58h70voyaa	Yes, something exciting to look forward to.|`|icTRTBAraa	You bet I am as long as the rain stays away they are predicting rain through Monday.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Absolutely.I am really looking forward to seeing Jeff break his winless streak in a points race!|`|VQHGqYXvaa	YEP all 3 Truck, Nationwide and Cup.. LETS GO RACING BOYS ! <br>  <br>  And ladys if theres any in there this week!|`|olopisx7aa	No. I just can't understand the point of cars going round and round in circles.|`|HGl8ddWjaa	nope i am not excited|`|NOool8qIaa	yes|`|JSryPP8faa	As hard as I've tried over the year's my taste for pickup truck's and racing just don't corralate and I went in person. It's the Nationwide and Sprint cup car's that garner my attention. Honesty is the best policy.|`|G72tc4AVaa	definitely - go harvick and edwards!!!!!!!!!!
Q2sZhNmJaa	When Robby wins an offroad compititions, it it is exciting, or a leg in Dakar.  When he finishes a race in Nascar it is exciting too.  I think I will be super excited when he wins a race in Cup, as long as he does it with out taking out half of the field.|`|c3tADklmaa	I feel that they won the Daytona 500!!!!|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Man it puts a smile on my face for a week. <br>  I wouldnt want him to win every race but every now again would be nice.|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	I have anxiety attacks when they win, then I get really ecstatic! The excitement of seeing them up front is soo much that I freak out, and my parents tell me I am not allowed to watch the races. <br>  <br>  As for the knowing you dont have much of a chance, I dont let that get in my way, because technically everyone has a chance, so I dont believe that there is no such thing as not having a chance.|`|muc8sq9naa	Totally awesome to win a race, but it really sux when your driver is out or so far behind you know they don't have a prayer.   BUT...you still pull for your driver if you are loyal, win or lose, you back their effort.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It isn't football, or baseball it's racing..<br>  Your driver usually beats somebody unless he finishes last..<br>  When he beats everybody it feels so much better..|`|kjAsuC6Haa	It's hard to explain. I always pick the underdog. I like to be surprised. When you see somebody struggle and come oh so close, week after week, and then FINALLY get one, it's a lot more exciting and satisfying to watch that guy win than a guy who knocks out wins like he's on an assembly line. You know that win means more to the underdog than the guy who wins 8 or 9 races a season and probably doesn't even look at his trophies once they're shipped home. It means more to you as a fan too. I think I'd be far happier over Elliott Sadler winning one race or Mark Martin winning a championship than a Johnson fan would be over Jimmie winning 3 championships. <br>  <br>  There's always a chance of winning somewhere, esp. at a track like Martinsville where anything can happen, and that's what keeps me coming back to support my driver.|`|i8soZLfRaa	Why do you think Matt was in tears last week? He knew he had a top 10 car, but he also knew he didn't have a winning car. Right place, right time. Everyone knew the rain was coming and should've been racing like the race would end any time. I'm just as disappointed that the race ended under a red flag for rain as anyone else. My boy, Mark was moving up in the field again, thanks to the adjustments they had made and the track was coming to the car.<br>  <br>  In the end, it didn't matter. When NASCAR called the race for rain, Matt was the leader, and gets credit for the win.|`|eg9VRVQaaa	It's an amazing feeling. Indescribable.<br>  <br>  I'm a huge fan of Cruz Pedregon, a famous NHRA drag racer. I wasn't a fan of his until he came out of retirement and raced with Advance Auto Parts sponsorship. I followed him for probably 4 years, watching him get eliminated in the first or second round every time, until he finally won a race. Vegas 06, I remember. And then this year, he won 3 events in a row, including my home track, and got the championship. I cried...totally awesome feeling.|`|AA11229410	I don't know if I am the only one that doesn't have a favorite.  The sport seems to feed the need for speed.  I had some British guy email me about a comment I made about F1 racing and I told him how much better NASCAR was and he emailed me a bunch of crap about why he like European racing and then blocked me.  I don't really give anyone a hard time here but that was annoying.  Send him my love, Chow baby.  <br>  <br>  Okay, Martin, Burton, Edwards, Kyle..... Not even in that order.  I just like skills and persistence.  I have a reason for each of them and there all different.  Watching Jimmy Johnson win is like watching a MASH rerun.  You like to watch it but you've been there, done that.|`|icTRTBAraa	You know its not always about winning and losing.  Its about watching the race and routing for your favorite driver.  I often pick drivers and sports team that don't always win because I hate the stereotype of winners and losers, we are all winners.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	when Jr. won Michigan I cried. I was the happiest I can ever remember. I would do anything to have that feeling again. That feeling knowing that MY driver, the one I root for each and every week only to have disappointment just beat 42 other guys. I WANT JR TO WIN!!!!!!!!|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	It felt horrible last year when Jeff didn't win,but it was a great feeling when he won the gatorade duel,even if it doesn't count.|`|bTZGob8qaa	It makes winning all the better, I can see winning getting old when it's done all the time.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	i really don't expect martin to win every weekend so when he does it feels awesome

Also he could be a Randel El type of player because he can throw it and run too.<br>  I think we will go OL though maybe trade up a few spots to get a good player like Michael Oher.<br>  Also, we should draft a few defensive lineman because ours are getting old.<br>  <br>  Players we should resign: Nate Washington, Marvel Smith, Bryant Mcfadden, Chris Kemoeatu and Byron Leftwich.|`|AktmOvVmaa	i think they do need offensive line man, but i dont think they should cut Mewelde. he's really good and sometimes gets more yards then parker

Tommy really punished him on ECW after haha. Seriously though, like, IDK why he betrayed Tommy. I'd probably know if I watched ECW, but I don't so... I'm guessing he wanted to be with the best.

uXXbegw5aa	Ronaldo to Real Madrid<br>  Torres says he's happy where he is and isn't going anywhere :)|`|L1QTSErIaa	I really believe Torres's move to Barca looks more likely. With Benitez increasingly prostituting himself to Real Madrid, Torres would not have a reason to stay at Anfield. <br>  Torres had always claimed it was Bentiez who helped his career prosper and the reason he came to England. He never gave credit to the club. If Benitez goes, he will bring Torres along. <br>  Sir Alex will never sell Ronaldo to the 'mob'.|`|ph58F3Dqaa	Torres to Barca, thts fking bulls*it, he said he wants to stay a long time at Liverpool and why would he wanna go to Barca when hes at the worlds best team, if he wanted to go to barca he would of gone when he had the chance to, but no he chose liverpool because he loves us. Ronaldo to Real, your having a laugh evrey1 knows that hed want to stay at a world class team in man united and not go to an average team like real, im a liverpool fan but its true. Engish teams are miles ahead of Spanish teams, the only reason why spain is so godd is because most of their players play in england|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Torres to Barcelona will never happen but C.Ronalda to Real Madrid is a FACT!!!!<br>  <br>  Barca will sign Villa....|`|DEcunDd5aa	C.Ronaldo to Real Madrid for sure. <br>  I don't think that Torres to Barca is likely at all.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Ronaldo's heart and head (and wallet) is already at Real, it's just his feet are still at the Swamp.|`|MUERDKyzaa	Why would barca want Torres. Everyone in Spain knows that david villa is better than him and is the best in the world. Guardiola does'nt even want to let go of Henry, rather Eto'o and its fairly obvious to everyone in spain that he wants Villa, next to Benzema. So Ronaldo to Real Madrid is much more likely, especially if Madrid get further this year in the Champions League than Man U.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Torres to Barcelona will likely happen first given the state of finances of Liverpool. As we all know, the economic recession globally has taken its toll. Liverpool's owners have to cough the money to pay their mounting debts. The only way for them to do this is to start selling "assets".|`|9gnVGV1baa	Ronaldo to Real madrid will happen one day and im a united fan. To be honest i want him to go because i have had enough of people saying united will be nothing without ronaldo.|`|uUitKmJMaa	<a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N163227090210-1712.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown...</a><br>  <br>  Read it.<br>  <br>  Torres doesnt wanna go any where else.|`|9VSvFnSMaa	Why torres to barca ?<br>  Yep ronaldo is more likely :D|`|Pfq2zRejaa	ronaldo 99%|`|SjVukApqaa	Who cares.|`|nwwhfuADaa	the 2nd im afraid|`|Bl6ctutYaa	Don't think Ferguson care's about losing Ronaldo as Rafa does Torres, because frankly without Gerrard and Torres, Liverpool are a mediocre team, so Ronaldo|`|zN82yuVDaa	torres to barcelona<br>  <br>  you don't really think sir alex ferguson is going to let go of ronaldo?|`|ZacGbxZDaa	Ronald to Real Madrid.

pANpZ3vaaa	After loosing Farve and other good players, they had to build the team back up!  Teams usually need a couple years before they can get back to where they were after a big loss!<br>  <br>  Doesn't mean McArthy is a bad coach or anything.  If they are bad, it all depends on how bad they are.  I dont think they will have a loosing season but they might not make the playoffs, with teams like Bears and Vikings in their division! <br>  <br>  I think they should be given another year unless they go like 7-9 or worse!|`|tPaRZod9aa	Give them another year. You cant forget that in the '07 season, McCarthy was coach of the year. The packers had a bad season this year because brett leaving and all of those injuries happened to fast to adjust. And the NFC north has only gotten better (besides the lions).|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	since they r switching to a 3-4 defense they can just use that as escuse to buy another year haha, but ya my prediction is the bears r going downhill and its a fight between the vikes and the pack for the nfc north|`|N3OuAcx3aa	Get some offense in there!!!|`|J76jjgsaaa	Being that Brett was such a huge part of Green Bay's success, you can't just expect Green Bay to pick up right where they left off when they had Favre. I'd say if they don't make the playoffs this year but they're a respectable 8-8 or maybe even 7-9, that's no reason to fire anyone.|`|BvlYQMf1aa	they should come back and try again|`|cdQryr7paa	I was really amazed that they didn't challenge for the division last season.<br>  To me, they were one of the biggest disappointments of the season.<br>  I look for them to rebound next season.<br>  They have a solid core of players and they will find a way.<br>  Keep the faith.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	no fkn way!!!!!!!

FeG9Knzlaa	It can be a good thing sometimes. For example, everyone thought Christian was attacking Jeff (that wouldn't have been predictable without the internet) and it was quite exciting for him to return but when it turned out to not be him, it was dissapointing. Thats an example where unpredictabillity was quite disappointing for people...I hope you get what I'm trying to say<br>  <br>  All in all, its about 50-50|`|UbUSth5haa	Predictability is kind of a 50/50 thing. Sometimes its a good thing, but sometimes its a bad thing. It depends upon the situation.

tivIxrX0aa	work on your pace, as it really adds to anyones game. just do some jogging, and then sprint for around 15 metres, then jog again, then sprint etc. and get used to the cold!<br>  <br>  also, try to do some weights. strength is a very important part of a defenders game (im a right back myself), so it should definetly not be overlooked. <br>  <br>  if youve been away from he game for a while then your technique may be lacking, to improve your first touch and first touch passing (can get you out of tight spots in defense) then just pass a ball into a wall at some speed, and try to pass it back into the wall as many times as you can.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Use the exercise bike, alot. If you can, get lifting bands called 'bodylastics', you can do all sorts of exercises with them. All about conditioning. Diet properly, and when it gets warmer out, run outside on soft ground.|`|5X0p45Zbaa	Remember that training is just as important as resting dont over train way to much its simple to get in shape i know its kind of snowy and alittle windy or sunny for some people but dont give up use your exercise bike and try as hard as you and as defense you got to have good heading , tackling , and in strong bodys if a striker is coming at you try your best and not let him get past you thats the job for defense no matter how good the player is dont let him past because the defense and goalie is the guardian of your team its like defending from a army. diet gotta be healthy and everyday at least run a 60 yard sprint or like some laps and just do your best!<br>  <a href="http://www.soccerwarmup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.soccerwarmup.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccer-training-info.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccer-training-info.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerpractice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerpractice.com</a>

Can the normal human athlete, or MOST athletes in a sport thats not their own, bat .202 in AA? Probably not..|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He sucked.  He was a minor leaguer and really only was even able to do that because of the publicity his team got by having Michael Jordan on their team.  He batted .202 playing AA ball.|`|c3tADklmaa	Oh good god! He sucked badly! Good thing he got the Bulls.

oNR7il8baa	Xavi by a mile and 3/4ths<br>  <br>  And I'm an Atleti fan|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Xavi. He's a Barca legend. Same as Puyol.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	Gerrard<br>  <br>  but he has to kick his (now frequent) diving habits|`|Yb0182Vxaa	Xavi|`|IWM1khX7aa	Xavi is the best center midfielder in the world, so that means he is better than Gerrard.<br>  <br>  Xavi tackles like a defender and passes like a world class playmaker.  You get 2 in 1 if you have this guy.  Xavi has done not only for Barcelona but for Spain.  He was voted the best player in the Euro 2008.  He reads the field better than Gerrard.  He will be a Barca legend (so will Gerrard at Liverpool).<br>  <br>  He has the ability to perfectly set up an attack, that's why Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi have been able to score like crazy this season.  Messi is the best player in the world, but Xavi...the most intelligent footballer in the world.|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Its like saying whos better Messi or C ronaldo? last season ronaldo and gerrard.<br>  But this season its All Xavi, he has been the best midfielder for the last 3 seasons.Without Xavi the barcelona midfield is not the same, Gerrard is a great player. Certainly one of the best mids in my opinion #2 behind xavi. but Xavi has been having more success at the domestic and international level. Thats why Xavi is better. Plus he sets up plays for the strikers, that allows them to score easy. he sets up the tempo and is a overall great mid. He defends and attacks.Perfect.|`|FgF39gBZaa	They are 2 different types of players. Xavi is more of a defensive player, than Gerrard, who is more of an attacker, playing two different types of Football. I would say Gerrard, but many others will disagree.|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Xavi by light millenniums.|`|n4kp5k6Gaa	Xavi ofcourse|`|VDh1fcGIaa	I think its pretty obvious....=)|`|HraimwiDaa	Xavi.<br>  And I'm a Real Madrid fan.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Xavi by LIGHTYEARS|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Xavi by the entire universe+ one trillion lightyears squared:P

In this age of free agency, and teams cutting costs, there is no way to know these things. Obviously, the Lakers and Cavs (because of Lebron and Kobe) have to be the most likely teams to win titles. The Raptors have a LONG way to go to even be considered contenders. Also, age will catch up with the Spurs at some point.

wd9EPcGWaa	if he says he is 16 and is really 20, that is 4 years short of a career that an organization would expect he could possibly play|`|4uSRVZNNaa	I agree with the first answer, but I also think it's a developmental issue.  if a guy's talent is at a certain level at 20 as opposed to say 23 or 24, that's a big difference.  his upside (talent level) is far better if he is younger, meaning there is more time to grow and mature and more likely that he will end up being a better player in the long haul. that affects how much a club will pay for his services, especially later in his career.  it also affects his potential trade value if it comes to that.<br>    <br>  for example, if you have a player that is going to potentially hit 30+ hr and 100+ rbis every year, he is going to command a certain amount of money come contract time.  the ultimate contract for such a star is a huge multi year deal.  if the player is in his mid to late 20s, he is virtually guaranteed that big contract. the club that signs him will expect that kind of production throughout the length of the contract.   the older he is, the more likely his play will start to decline because of age.  (unless the club in question is the yankees. but that's a whole other answer in itself)|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I don't see any real problem other than the simple fact that when you break someones trust, you've let them down. His age isn't really that important, but its a matter of principle that he lied. I personally don't like being lied to even over the smallest most insignificant things, so I see how it would have been a big deal to those involved.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Of course it's important.  Besides the obvious ethical problems of lying to your boss.  He got more money because of this lie.<br>  <br>  You display a certain set of skills as a 16 year old, people can wonder and project what you'll be with a few years of learning and maturity, and you get signed to a contract based on that projection<br>  <br>  If you've got those same skills when you are 19 or 20, then a few years of development, you are already 23 or 24 years old.  There is a lot less potential there, and you aren't nearly as marketable.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Like it or not, athletes only are considered prospects up until they're a certain age. If not in the "high minors" or top professional league by a certain age, the chances of getting a promotion start going down - and fast. More importantly, lying is bad, regardless of what it is, regardless of the cirumstances.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	He would lie to get a longer contract for more money! <br>  <br>  You people who don't see the lack of morality in players engaging in cheating by taking steriods and lying to ownership about their age never cease to amaze me.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Think about it.  The way baseball contracts work is they get a player in their minor league system, and when they finally bring the player up, they have exclusive rights to him for 6 years.  <br>  <br>  If you look at a player's skills and are looking at them as a 16 year old, you will judge him differently than a 20 year old.  I mean that person you think is 16 you're judging as a 16 year old, knowing he's going to get better.  If you really knew he was 20 you would expect him to be a lot better, because thats 4 years of improvements you're losing.<br>  <br>  Case and point, you have a 19 year old who was rookie-level MVP last year.  Lets say it takes him 2 years to progress through A, AA, and AAA and finally be called up to the majors.  You're talking he'll be 21 maybe 22 when he's called up, provided he does well, thats the type of prospect you want, he's progressing well for his age and you'll have him in the prime of his career.<br>  <br>  Now, lets say you find out that the 19 year old was really 23.  I mean, yeah, he was still rookie ball MVP, he still hit .343, but you're now talking a 23 year old playin against 18 and 19 year olds straight out of high school, not as special.  Plus, who knows how much better he's going to get, or if he's peaked. If he does, given the same timeline as I did before, he'll be hitting the majors at 25 or 26.  You're exclusinve rights to him then run out when he's 31/32, possibly past his prime.  <br>  <br>  So, you're talking a guy who's going to be coming into the league now as a rookie, the same age or older then players like Dustin Pedroia who's working on his 3rd season.  Add in the learning curve and you're talking a guy who, if he turns out to be good, probably wont be good till hes like 27/28, and then you don't have nearly as many years left with him as you would with a 21 year old.|`|GMcdPLoIaa	The younger kids lie that they are 16 so that they can sign a contract sooner.  The older kids lie to make them appear better for their "age" and be more attractive for a team to sign.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind this pertains to mostly foreign born players since they are not subjected to the June draft, and are just signed at will by whoever wants them.|`|UTAGICeSaa	Well if a player is 21 and he says he is 16 or 17 thats like 4-5 years that an organization expects him to play and develop skills and knowledge around the league which will help that player to get to the MLB younger than he would being 20. Another thing is that if a player is getting signed as a free-agent being 16, he will surely get so much more money than he would being older.|`|BMoLTrNMaa	His team trusted him and then he betrayed them. of course it matters
qQiOtyuzaa	I'd think for self defense , kickboxing would be better. In karate, you spend alot of time doing kata (unless you're in a dojo that focuses more on sparring). <br>  <br>  Also alot of karate sparring is light to medium contact (unless you're in a style that focuses on hard-contact, like Kyokushin karate) . That's not bad for beginners, but you eventually need to learn how to take a punch so you can keep on fighting when attacked for real . <br>  <br>  Some of the blocks in karate also aren't that great to use against much bigger opponents. I nearly got my arm broken trying to use a low block to stop a kick in a tournament (the guy was about twice the size of me in height and width), and that was after YEARS of training in karate and TKD . (I'd never fought full-contact before that) <br>  <br>  And if you decide to go into kickboxing.....make sure that it's REAL kickboxing and not carido kickboxing .|`|3WzvuPB4aa	I think Kickboxing is a more realistic art.  Nothing against Karate, as I have nothing but respect for any Martial Arts practitioner, but if I were in a confrontation with a Karate student and he went to horse stance, I'd kick him in the balls.  If he had one hand up and one hand at his hip, I'd go for a roundhouse kick to the dome.  I know traditional Karate is a good base for learning, but I think Kickboxing, and MMA in general, are much broader arts.  <br>  <br>  My advice is to start with the Kickboxing, and then compliment that with taking up Jiu Jitsu.  I've always been an advocate that the best type of self defense for women for rape prevention is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Why?  Because you learn a ton of offensive moves from the same position that a potential rapist would put you in.  But, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.|`|f1f7IQIKaa	Honestly,except for there stance,Kickboxing is just full contact Karate. That is why allot of Kickboxing Teachers used to or DO run a  Karate class on the side. Kickboxing was made by 3 Champion Karate students,who did not like the limitations of Karate,I recommend Kickboxing but ONLY because there are ALLOT more Karate Mcdojo's,and in this world,I dont want you loosing money.<br>  <br>  Obviously there is a Karate Fan boy running around giving Kick boxers a thumbs down. Kickboxing is better. Take a class of each,and determine your opinion.|`|VwEUO6reaa	its horses for courses really...we have done kick boxing and really enjoyed it as well as tae kwon do which we also liked..the best thing to do is go to a reputable club and go from there..it also depends whether you are going to just get fit or if you are into the whole martial arts thing kick boxing is better in my opinion for self defence|`|l89kUn4naa	what you need to do is MMA(Mixed Martial Arts) it trains you how to defend better the boxing or karate and it also teaches you self discipline.|`|Lk09F1OTaa	Karate helps dicipline your mind so it's more relevant to real life.|`|Q7QID49Kaa	karate|`|UGV9O3Veaa	Kickboxing is soo cool! my friend goes there and she kicked me so hard, i HAD to go to hospital!!!! you gotta learn kickboxing lol :)|`|YDpT2ClBaa	it doesnt matter which one, they are both equally as good. that the one with the better instructor thats what is really important. all styles have there pro's and con's|`|2gx2LgzEaa	If you want self defense, Karate. <br>  <br>  If you want sport, Kickboxing.<br>  <br>  Watch both and try em out, see which one fits you best. Talk to the instructors, Shop around, every serious practicioner does that so you wont offend anyone by asking for a trial or asking to watch a class or 2 first. If they dont let you, move on. <br>  <br>  Its sort of like Kung fu, Northern styles work better for some, while others are more comfortible with southern or Hung gar. <br>  <br>  Noone can really tell you which one is right for you but you.<br>  <br>  But neither will be easy starting out ;) if you want a good self defense Karate though, look for the Japanese styles or even chinese styles. <br>  <br>   TKD has been reduced unfortunately to more flash then anything useful... (Why kick someone in the head, when you have so many targets just below the waist, groin, feet, legs, knees, and you dont kill your center of gravity!)|`|gBO908P6aa	Nothing is "easy".

Takes self-discipline to do this but it is possible.|`|UxU7qZGTaa	Focus pads, conditioning in the form of lifting and running, and sparring.

M9JF9qcOaa	Bradley is injury prone, although the ratios are potentially impressive. But with your stacked outfield you don't need him.<br>  Cantu is a slight upgrade over Reynolds, but only in AVG. I think the rest of your roster can carry Reynolds AVG, so this is marginal. Cantu is still a OBP, SLG and OPS liability.<br>  <br>  On the other end of the deal, Sanchez is a liability, with huge ERA, WHIP and L risk. I don't think the upside is worth having him start for you in this league, so he is a throw in.<br>  <br>  This is why I will simplify it to Soriano for Oswalt, they are the ones who will determine the value of the deal. <br>  I think Soriano, although a moderate injury risk, will contribute in all categories. <br>  Oswalt is on the decline, he is no longer a 200K guy (maybe 7K/9), his ERA is rising year by year. I don't think he is going to improve in his early 30s. He is still good, especially in a league with IP (200+) and therefore QS, just I don't think he is quite as good as Soriano.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to do you trust the pitching staff you drafted. I like the mix, but I understand if you want to replace Maholm with a safer player. I always trust that free agent pitchers will emerge (assuming you can pick up undrafted players for free) during the season, so I am willing to take a gamble on a few high-risk/high-reward pitchers along with a few safer guys.|`|ogFPGxpXaa	Amazing team! BUT U NEED A-ROD|`|cWmx0J4jaa	sure, if you can pull it off. Oswalt is almost a stud as he slows down, Cantu has some pop in the IF and Bradley when he's not unjured or suspended is usually pretty solid.<br>     Soriano I think is over-rated from his Yankee years Sanchez is a huge question mark in SF. I would take a proven SP over a young guy and I would take Bradley/Cantu over Soriano. Not sure if the other guy would agree but I would feel i got over if I made this deal personally.

They are currently members of the Western Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). Originally called the Los Angeles Chargers, the club began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League. The club spent its first season in Los Angeles, California before moving to San Diego in 1961. The Chargers play home games at Qualcomm Stadium.<br>  The Chargers won one AFL title in 1963 and reached the AFL playoffs five times and the AFL Championship four times before joining the NFL (1970) as part of the AFL-NFL Merger. In the 34 years since then, the Chargers have made ten trips to the playoffs and four appearances in the AFC Championship game. At the end of the 1994 season, the Chargers faced the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX and fell 49-26. The Chargers have six players and one coach enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio: wide receiver Lance Alworth (1962-1970), defensive end Fred Dean (1975-1981), quarterback Dan Fouts (1973-1987), head coach/general manager Sid Gillman (1960-1969, 1971), wide receiver Charlie Joiner (1976-1986), offensive lineman Ron Mix (1960-1969) and tight end Kellen Winslow (1979-1987).|`|tFrCoJlVaa	Titans|`|AA11502346	San Diego Chargers.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	New York Giants|`|r9lfDeRmaa	Go Bucs!|`|ixOE0onnaa	i pick is cowboys they respent where i live at.|`|YaITofFfaa	a|`|JpvXhgmraa	Carolina Panthers....the RIGHTFUL 2008-09 NFL Champions.

83TPsWimaa	I've done similar trips to work and back for the last few years, and have a physically demanding job.  Mine is 32 miles each way.  I usually start by working my way to be able to go one way (I can take a train part way if I choose) and then work my way back as well.   When I'm riding both ways in one day I usually take the next day off, or only go one way.  For me the most reliable way was to start riding to work one day, and riding back the next, etc.  But that's just me.  Then I can push it and ride back if I feel like it, and I would also do longer weekend rides...but time can be the issue, and you will want some lights, otherwise you will be able to ride both ways about 20 days...<br>  And I'm assuming you have showers at work?|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You life will consist of working, cycling, and sleeping.  The bright side is that you will lose weight.|`|AA11056614	It can be done, BUT plan on 2.5 hrs minimum each way. It's not the fitness level (although you will have to work up to that type of distance on a regular basis) ... it's the time requirement (and daylight and weather in fall and winter). A second concern is saddle sores. Unless you take care you WILL get saddle sores and that requires time off the bike to heal. I suspect 3-4 days/week would be a maximum practical goal ... but it really depends on your determination and discipline.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	I live 15 minutes by car away from my workplace which means I can pop home at lunch and eat pies*.<br>  <br>  Move closer to work and you too can indulge in your pie cravings.<br>  <br>  *sometimes I eat sandwiches instead.|`|KBfUwbCzaa	Is it uphill or downhill?|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	Yes, very feasible.  You will need to allow 2 or so hours, depending, for your commute.  I know a few people in my club who ride from Wellingborough to MK every day.  This is a comparative distance. You will need to keep fuelled, etc.  But as a commute it is viable.<br>  <br>  If you are out of shape, then you are right to worry about your recovery.  I would take a recovery drink with me for the other end, or a snack etc. that will allow you to re-fuel your muscles at the end of the run.  However, I would be tempted, until you get back to viable fitness, to ride one rest one at first.  In this way, you could look at working up to the daily commute, without going for burnout.<br>  <br>  Luck

C1gT0pDOaa	It totally depends on the type of track you are racing on!--Dragstip or oval?  Road Course I need more Information about track type and intended usage to give a more detailed answer!!!!!|`|he3Od6owaa	If you are drag racing you will need a higher gear in the rear end which will get you the high reving.but if you want good mpg then will you will probably want a lower gear.I own a 1980 camaro and i do street and strip.I run a 3.89 gear,so i can still cruise down the high way at 2 to 2500 RPM but then go to the dragstrip and run decent numbers.|`|DXV0A1haaa	Different engines have different characteristics, which is better is all relative.  Take for instance the little Honda S2000 or Mazda RX-8, neither makes power worth squat below 6,000 RPM's, but when wound up to 8,000 and higher they are more than happy.  Try to hit those numbers with a big-block V8 or a diesel though, and you're going to hate life.  <br>  <br>  In general terms, smaller displacement engines have to wind up higher on the tach to generate as much power as a bigger heavier engine, though the larger engines will make much better power earlier and run out of operating range quickly.  <br>  <br>  As examples, the old pickup I learned to drive in (big block Ford V-8) was completely worthless past 4,000 RPM's but could pull a 30-foot boat out of the water just fine at a little over 1900 RPM's.  My little 4-banger doesn't make max torque until 4,300, and max HP is almost 6,000.  The Ford would have launched a rod or spun a bearing trying to operate at those revs.  <br>  <br>  As a general pro and con, small displacement high-revving engines tend to be more thermally efficient, more fuel efficient, and require more RPM's to do their work.  As a result, they are usually built to run at higher RPM's and tend to be smoother, but depend mostly on their horsepower to do their work. <br>  <br>  Larger displacement engines and diesels tend to focus not on horsepower so much as torque, and are generally built and packaged to operate much lower RPM's not only to take advantage of cooler operating temperatures but also because physics dictates that heavier items can't move as fast (think pistons, rods, bearings) before they start to fail.  <br>  <br>  In the case of diesels, the diesel combustion cycle just plain takes longer to complete than gasoline, so after a certain point on the tach a diesel becomes less efficient in a hurry.|`|MU5h69Siaa	it doesnt really make any difference cuz the engine will rev as much as it needs to get going. if you have a car they revs easier and slower and acccelarates just as fast as the high reving one, that prolly means that it gets better milage tho

Here are just a few that popped into my mind at the moment:<br>  <br>  1) Underestimating the opponent<br>  2) Turning your back (for any reason including spinning kicks)<br>  3) Backing up (you simply can't fight well backing up)<br>  4) Trying to fake the opponent out so you can throw your favorite technique.<br>  5) Having a plan of what you will do before hand. (You must be able to deal with what the situation is. you can't always get waht you want so you can do what you want to. you must be flexinble and able to adapt to the situation instantly)<br>  6) Trying to use head kicks as your main method of attack.<br>  7) Trying to do any fancy technique. (Simple techniques will always work better)<br>  8) Standing to far away from the opponent.<br>  9) Backing away from kicks and then trying to get in range to counter. (Is just asking to get nailed, you just stay in range by deflecting or avoiding the kick yet staying in range to counter.)<br>  10) Being a counter kicker or counter puncher. In other words don't flinch and instantly launch a kick just because the opponent kicks. (Better to kick if he punches and punch if he kicks.) <br>  11) Losing your temper or getting mad. (You lose all self control)<br>  <br>  And there are many more. This just scratches the surface<br>  <br>  <br>  I see the Thumbs down fairy is present again. I see no need for it here.

It's works AMAZINGLY! thats what i do to all mine. Once it comes out nice and warm just rub some glove conditioner on it and work the glove out while it's still warm! them stick a ball it the pocket where it feels comfortable and rubberband or Bungee cord(which i prefer) it **** for a day or 2.

Depend on what postion your glove is for is the way your going to break it in. <br>  <br>  Outfeilders- You want have a big web so you want to flair the glove. When you flair it you have to take the pinky end and the thumb end and bend it outwards from the top of the glove, so the top and the web is bigger. You want to keep playing with it by bending it over and over, keep playing with it to break it in faster. Also tou want to catch the balls in the web only wen you start to use it so the pocket gets deeper.<br>  <br>  Infeilders-  You want to shape it to your best comfort in which you have it shaped to a point where you can get the ball in and out of your glove as quickly as you can. As an infeilder you want to catch the ball more in the palm than in the web of the glove so you have a quicker transtion. I like to fold the pinky end in toward the middle while pushin the top of the thumb end out awy from the middle. <br>  <br>  Oil never hurts the glove, since it keeps it from drying out as quickly, but if you put to much oil on it changes the color of the glove and makes it weight a bit more than what you want.

pVpQuWXzaa	These are the most important pads, and the first consideration is size. They need to fit snugly but comfortably. To be measured for adult football pads, stand up straight with your arms at your sides and have someone measure the width across your back from shoulder tip to shoulder tip, rounding up to whole inches. For youth football pads, do the same but consider chest size and weight as well:<br>  <br>  Youth<br>  shoulder pads<br>   Back measure (inches)<br>   Chest size (inches)<br>   Weight (pounds)<br>   Adult<br>  shoulder pads<br>   Back measure (inches)<br>   <br>  XX Small<br>   11 - 12<br>   24 - 26<br>   40 - 60<br>   Medium<br>   17 - 18<br>   <br>  X Small<br>   12 - 13<br>   26 - 28<br>   50 - 70<br>  <br>   Large<br>   18 - 19<br>   <br>  Small<br>   13 - 14<br>   28 - 30<br>   60 - 80<br>  <br>   X large<br>   19 - 20<br>   <br>  Medium<br>   14 - 15<br>   30 - 32<br>   70 - 100<br>  <br>   2X large<br>   20 - 21<br>   <br>  Large<br>   15 - 16<br>   32 - 34<br>   90 - 120<br>  <br>   3X large<br>   21 - 22<br>   <br>  X Large<br>   16 - 17<br>   34 - 36<br>   110 - 140<br>  <br>   4X large<br>   22 - 23<br>   <br>   <br>   5X large<br>   24 +<br>   <br>  <br>  Quarterbacks, defensive backs, tailbacks, punters and place kickers: Skill position players generally want flexible, lightweight football pads that don't limit head movement or vision. If the QB also runs, huskier pads are a good plan because he's giving the defenders more chances to pile on him.<br>  <br>  Wide receivers: Very much like other skill position pads, receivers use the lightest pads to allow them additional speed.|`|5CLx01G1aa	It usually has a weight range on the pads.
Y4mz8BShaa	Mock suppressor.<br>  <br>  A mock suppressor won't do anything except add weight and size unless you run a longer inner barrel through it. By itself, it just hinders your ability to use the airsoft gun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftgi.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Barrel+extension&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftgi.com/advanced_search...</a><br>  <br>  Any barrel extension with 14mm CCW threads will work your airsoft gun.

oqQjnpfGaa	Overall recommendation: NO<br>  <br>  Do this trade only if you can get a better player than Dampier back. <br>  <br>  Right now Stuckey is in a mini-slump but when he is good this trade will be slightly bad for you.  Aldridge is a very consistent player and IMO better than Prince.  Try getting a solid player for Stuckey, Dampier is only good for rebounds/blocks<br>  <br>  From a fantasy perspective, if you get Aldridge/Dampier you get: <br>  The same: points (about the same)<br>  <br>  The good: <br>  * More rebounds<br>  * Higher FG%<br>  * Less Turnovers<br>  * More blocks<br>  <br>  The bad: <br>  * Less 3pts <br>  * way less Assists<br>  * Lower FT%<br>  * A few more steals<br>  <br>  Unless you are a king at rebounds/blocks/FG%, then this trade will just make you weaker in those areas.  However, you might want to do this trade if you get someone better than Dampier because having 3 pistons is quite a risk.

E2YkgSnZaa	I am a varsity collegiate rower for the Univ. of Alabama, and I usually prep myself for 2k races in a similar manner to yours...early bedtime, plenty of fluids, a huge dinner, extra sleep. <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to mentally break the race up into little 200m chunks. Try and mentally coach yourself through those 200m pieces...for example what I'll do is for the first 3 or 4 200m pieces, I'll try and shave a half second off my split time. When you get to that halfway point, just keep telling yourself that you're more than halfway done. Keep climbing down that 200m tower. Shave a half second each time. When you reach 500m, I wouldn't go all out...but I would maybe take 3 or 4 3/4 length strokes at a high pace (34-38 strokes/min) to get the adrenalyn flowing...then at the 300m I hit the gas and just go all out. For the last 100 meters, mentally count out the last ten strokes and give it hell. Bend that oar handle or if you're on a machine, make that flywheel scream. Kick as hard as you can with your legs and really stretch forward on the recovery.<br>  <br>  Most of all, just give it your all. There's nothing worse than getting out of a race and knowing you had anything left in the tank. Leave it all out on the water or on the machine. Good luck!
LnJjS8BRaa	Lying isn't a great solution. Bandage it with a medical gauze wrap and just go to class. If anyone asks say you hurt yourself (technically it's more true than most people who say it) but that it isn't going to effect your training.<br>  <br>  Because you said you slipped up I am going to assume that you're trying to stop. Good luck with everything. I hope you find what you're looking for in your training.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Yeah.... You need to see a psychiatrist. No offense, but you definitely need to seek help if you're not already getting it from a doctor.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, wrap your wrist in medical bandages and tell them you cut yourself on a fence or you burned your hand on the stove eye.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	This is the wrong area. You should seek professional help since you have a bigger problem than hiding your scars. Self mutilation is a serious issue related to depression. You need to quit worrying about karate classes and get your problems taken care of through counciling. Good luck.|`|UxU7qZGTaa	You can't were wristbands or wraps during karate.  You can however wear bandages and lie about hurting yourself in an accident.|`|AA11101806	Just use standard athletic tape and tape your wrists.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	just wear wrist bands dude, or a hand wrap on your left hand-if people ask, tell them your wrist hurts
ubGNtkHQaa	That's why we have ignorant people (Yankee haters) who can't stand the yankees and believe what they want to believe (even if it's false)|`|axxQzOCHaa	I do. <br>  In my opinion, a cheater is a cheater, whether if such substances were "legal / illegal at the time" or not.<br>  <br>  ** Anyone seen his Maybelene commerical ?? **<br>  << Maybe he was born it (ability) .. Maybe it's make - believe. >>|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Obviously, they wouldn't call him a cheater if it was legal. <br>  <br>  However, I don't buy your argument about the eye/hand coordination and Neither does Bob Costas. I believe he called it "nonsensical". All you have to do is look at the numbers. The players that juiced had dramatic increases in their homerun totals over time.<br>  <br>  If the steroids made these players bigger and stronger it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that they are more likely to hit homeruns.|`|b4bca8c21af83ca96ef687dca4ae6b00aa	You mean A-ROID!! Yes people would still call him a cheater because all of the players before now had to play baseball without steroids and if A-ROID breaks their records it is not right! And by the way the yankees suck! GO REDSOX|`|ak5A435maa	dude.. they didnt even sell the drug with a prescription in the DR! tell me thats not illegal!|`|gMTatFZBaa	My God this question never gets old every five minutes.<br>  <br>  Get a clue.|`|4xnbDihJaa	People wouldn't call him a cheater, because he would not have been cheating.  Also, steroids wouldn't be illegal if they didn't also harm your body when you took them.<br>  A Rod is incredibly talented, and steroids do not make you a better contact hitter.  However, they do dramatically increase strength, which is essential to power hitting.|`|3OBmjBsNaa	They will.  It was illegal even if it wasn't banned then.  Steroids don't affect hand to eye coordination, so I agree, he showed he can hit with or without them.  If he used for 2-3 years, his numbers were as good before and after.  Bonds was a bigger deal.  He never broke 50 hr's in a season, then hits 73.  Amazing that out of 104 players who tested positive, we only know about one -- and now he is the fall guy for all 103 others.  It's not right.  We need to know all the other names, so we can assess the seriousness of his "cheating".  If every contender for a Cy Young or MVP in the past 10 years was juiced, we're being far too hard on A-Rod.  He's getting hammered for "not coming clean enough", well where are the other 103???|`|OPSFSpRsaa	What do you mean the guy still has to hit the ball?  I don't know if you've ever watched baseball, but stronger swings equals more home runs.    I will briefly walk you through the logic of the argument against steroids.<br>  <br>  Yes, you still have to hit the ball, but most of the time there is a significant difference in simply hitting the ball on a regular basis versus hitting the ball out of the park on a regular basis.   One scores runs sometimes, the other scores runs every time.  <br>  <br>  When you score or bat in more runs than other players, you are usually considered better than those other players.  He has an unfair advantage over the other players who choose not cheat and lie to the fans about it. <br>  <br>   Do you get the picture ?|`|xBiwuNuUaa	Steroids won't take a guy who can't hit major league pitching and make him a .300 hitter with power.  However, if you have the skills already, those magic muscles you just grew will turn fly ball outs into home runs as sure as World Series games on Fox will all end after midnight. <br>  <br>  It's hard for me to have a lot of sympathy for a guy like A-Roid who, like Bonds did it just because he could.  He was already a terrific, 5 tool player, not coming back from an injury, not trying to break into the league and earn just one ML paycheck... <br>  <br>  What a waste... stupid, indeed.|`|r2aPlUPXaa	Grey area.If he shot a performance enhancing drug,probably not too cool. But: Do pain killers enhance your performance? What about gatorade? Hmmm.If a lot of players were doing it,cut him some slack.Let's see what he can do without the drugs. I mean at least he owned up to it when busted.Not like Baroid,who lied under oath.Do you think he needed performance enhancing drugs when he hung out with Madonna?   Tony M.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Same reason they call Bonds , and McGuire cheaters... Because they are haters!<br>  None of them used PED's after they were illegal...<br>  But one the other hand some ppl give A-Rod and Big Mac a Pass, but wanna Burn Bonds at the stake... Wich IMO is not fair...|`|0XTSsephaa	Oh you did not hear the reports from the New York press today?  In 2007 he was commonly seen with a trainer who is banned from baseball and used to carry duffel bags full of steroids.<br>  <br>  QUIT BEING A-ROD JOCKERS YOU SORRY SYCOPHANTS!|`|AA10915692	Because balls that are normally hit off the wall, would now go over the wall. Singles are now doubles. Routine fly balls are doubles and home runs. Do you need more help with this?|`|vv0v03SHaa	steroids do effect a lot of things.

C7qWlWBkaa	Initially, no, snowboarding is very different from skiing. However, once you start linking your turns and carving, it feels similar to parallel skiing - just think of skis stuck together and your body turned 90 degrees. Once you become good at snowboarding, you'll appreciate the light weight of the board (nice in powder) and the softer boots. Try it a few times and you'll love it!|`|jTaW3goeaa	No, its going to be hard either way.  Snowboarding is completely different from skiing|`|LdLEDGZqaa	noooo i ski and it was really hard for me to start snowboarding you hav to take few runs to get the hang of it|`|WTw9BSOYaa	Wakeboarding and Skateboarding/Longboarding have more of a cross over to Snowboarding than Skiing.<br>  <br>  Think about it, Snowboarding and Skiing are totally opposite, everything from balancing to how you turn is different, with a background in Wakeboarding you will have an up on people who have never done a board sport before, but over all you will still spend at least a few painful days on the bunny hill.<br>  <br>  Over all the learning curve for the basic's of Snowboarding also take more time to gather than Skiing, so you might get discouraged by this being a Skier, so I guess it might even work against you more than for you as far as morale goes.|`|wd9EPcGWaa	For a normal skier NO.  It's really had when you start.  But since you wake it may come more natural
yTkNT3OSaa	While the speedsafe feature does not fall within the traditional definition of a switchblade, your local laws may have a different definition or it may be interpreted differently.<br>  <br>  Kershaw supply details of how the speedsafe system differs from a traditional switchblade; present this information to whom it may concern and request that the knife be re-examined.|`|c5d46e3c7eb9fa9356007718f6f2444caa	I do not know of any switchblade knives that Kershaw has made, but that does not mean that one has not been modified to be a switchblade.  If you are talking about one of the Kershaw Speedsafe designs then they are NOT switchblades.  By definition a switchblade requires the blade to be released by manipulating a button, lever, switch, etc. that is not part of the blade.  The Speedsafe design requires that you manipulate the blade itself.  Be advised that I am only speaking in general, local authorities may have declared the Speedsafe design to be a switchblade.  In any case make sure you are represented by an attorney when you go to court.  If your family is hiring an attorney make sure he or she is familiar with the knife laws of your state, county, municipality.  If you are using a public defender you may need to go the extra mile to provide the attorney with information regarding those laws--it should be available on-line.  Your attorney must also be familiar with details of knife design, especially as it pertains to the Speedsafe design.  Once again there is a lot of information on-line about the design.  Good Luck.

The eagle is intended for target shooting and hunting.  The glock for self defense.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Desert Eagles, while looking pretty, are reasonably useless, other than for intimidation. If want a good gun that is actually sensible to own? Go for the glock.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	The Glock is a better buy if it was $900 and the Deagle was free<br>  <br>  And I pretty much hate Glocks|`|oZj6DfpKaa	The Desert Eagle is a cleaner shooting gun by way of it's gas piston action, but is heavy and unsuited for carrying around for any real time frame.  It looks cool, but it is a beast and not "real world" practical; especially for the money.<br>  <br>  The Glock may be "dirtier" in it's recoil action, but the thing will continue to shoot and shoot until you are tired of pulling the trigger.  Glock's have withstood torture test after torture test, doing things no person would do to a gun and still went BANG when the trigger was pulled.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the Glock 20 in 10mm.  Using full power rounds, it exceeds the .357 Magnum and can drop a deer in it's tracks.  You can also buy a .40 barrel for it and convert it to that caliber in about 30 seconds (same thing for .357Sig).  Even uses the same magazines.  Or you can shoot standard power 10mm (FBI Rounds)...they have the same power as the .40 cal.|`|AS5bLez1aa	Depends on which Desert Eagle your talking about.I own a 9mm Baby Desert Eagle that holds 15 in the magazine and one chambered.A very well respected gun in the real gun world.Glocks are just cheaper and lighter easier to conceal accuracy? Depends on the shooter,You can buy a Desert Eagle in the 9mm or 40 and 45 acp for $600.00 If you can find them,It's called supply and demand.I have shot both Desert Eagle my choice although it is heavier for conceal carry for that I carry a KEL-TEC 9mm good gun for $300.00.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	It depends on what you want to use it for.  I consider the Desert Eagle to be a novelty handgun to shoot for fun.  I know people who conceal carry it in 44 Magnum, but it's a large gun.<br>  <br>  The Glock is more for conceal carry because of its size.|`|AA11640949	If those were the only 2 options I had and the Glock was priced at $900 (extremely overpriced), I would still pick the Glock.|`|DV4xyeChaa	i heard the eagles in alaska sued after they named that POS desert eagle....overpriced over sized...,,,a waste of metal..|`|THvXrJYxaa	Go with the Glock.

LIKkt8djaa	You're about right for the size, If you're looking for an all-mountain setup which it sounds like i would look in the 148 to 152 range, You're still young and probably have some growing to do so if you don't plan on or want to buy a new board when you grow then go on the larger end of that size range.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	That sounds about right, yeah.|`|WTw9BSOYaa	Not to comment, but wow you are small! <br>  At 115 lbs Id say you should be looking at decks around 144-148 for freeriding and 138-144 for freestyle, you are a small person and require a smaller deck.<br>  Some companies dont offer snowboards this small in their main lines, but you shouldn't be put off by riding a child's deck, I have a friend who is around the same height/weight as you that rides child's boards, she is 25.<br>  Id say for what you are looking for a deck that would work in the park or out bombing some groomers, you should try to find something around 144.<br>  <br>  [EDIT] Just saw you are 13, and I am guessing you are a guy, but please correct me if I am wrong lol <br>  In that case id go for a bit bigger, something around a 146 or even a 148 would do, being that you could ride it for at least a few seasons that way, I wouldn't stray into the 150s yet though.|`|XI74yGYUaa	well, when you go to buy the snowboard, doesn't the seller help you out?<br>  and isn't the snowboard length based on your height?<br>  <br>  uhh, tried to help.<br>  (x
qyATAaeXaa	I'd say a good place to find some historical info about the resort would be with some of the longer tenured employees and mountain volunteers. Many resorts have a "chapter" of the 80+Ski Club. These are octogenarians who regularly ski the area, usually during the weekdays. These old guys are awesome sources for info about a resort's history. Most of them wear a small white-and-red patch with "80+" on their jackets. Also stop by the resort's Marketing offices. I bet they have at least one copy of every year's trail map and and brochure on file.<br>  <br>  You can also contact the New England Ski Museum. They may have some info. If you are close to Franconia Notch, stop by for a visit. I spent a whole day there once just looking at old stuff.

AA10264508	I am sure you will wear team jersey or t-shirt on the court, but during lunch time or other break time, you might want to switch to your own casual t-shirt. If you wear volleyball shoes in the gym, you might want to switch to your normal running shoes when taking a lunch break and when your games are over.<br>  Make sure you bring some comfortable chairs for your parents if any of them drive you to the tournament. Set them up outside the court (and for some gyms you can do it inside the gym next to your court), so that they don't have to suffer sitting there all day on the floor or on the guest stand. <br>  Bring your favorite music player, a book, or something that can help you relax (video game). Tournament is usually a whole day thing (at least five hours), so don't stress out.<br>  You may bring some sport-water and light snack. Sometimes your schedule would not allow you to take lunch until 2pm so be prepared. Most gyms offer cafeteria or similar facility, but make sure you don't eat anything too heavy. Whole grain crackers and those 100-Calories packs are good.<br>  <br>  Playing pool style means that if you are in a pool of five teams, you play once with each of those other four teams, best two of three. You will get more "team standing points" if you can get better score in each game/set, and if you beat a team that has higher standing than you have. Usually there is no play-off. You play based on your schedule, and do line-judge and scorer's job when not playing.<br>  <br>  Playing Saturday tournament is fun but takes some planning for the coach (or coaching staff). It is hard to explain how to motivate a team, as it is a little too complicated. As a player you want to follow the coach's direction, arrive on time, go through your routine warm-up before each game starts, and stay positive with your teammates. Call the ball, move your feet, high five your teammates, comment a good serve, save... and make sure that you are not the only one making those comments.|`|dGPlTJL9aa	if there r 4 teams PLAY REF <br>  1-3 2 <br>  2-4 1 <br>  1-4 3 <br>  2-3 1 <br>  3-4 2 <br>  1-2 4 <br>  it's based on what team number u r<br>  <br>  4 5 teams it's PLAY REF <br>  1-5 4 <br>  2-3 1 <br>  4-5 3 <br>  1-2 4 <br>  3-5 2 <br>  1-4 3 <br>  2-5 1 <br>  3-4 5 <br>   normally u want to bring a blanket, pillows,stuuf u need 2 ref, also stuff 2 entertain u'r self<br>  <br>  mostly u should eat fruits<br>  (try the night be4 to eat stuff like pasta it gives u enery)|`|Kb4yS1xsaa	u shuld bring snacks. u dnt really need xtra socks or a brush. unless ur obssesed with your hair. power bars taste really good and give you energy. i would say dont drink gatorade cuz it gives you energy but then brins u down l8r. drink water. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ND, wheres ur tournament? i hav 1 2moro[:|`|zvq3uiB6aa	Okay, what I bring is:<br>  Gym bag to hold all my crap<br>  Cut up fruit (and veggies but fruit is the best!)<br>  A roll of pre-wrap or and extra headband is you are allowed/prefer<br>  Extra ponytail holders<br>  Hair brush<br>  <br>  Pool style is what we do during the regular season too.

If you apply for (for instance) the United States TST for the 3 group matches and they somehow don't qualify for the tournament, then you lose your 10% TST Service fee for those 3 games (depending on the category of tickets you ordered, you lose either $48, $36 or $24).  Otherwise, you get all your money back.  So the risk of applying for a TST (and that is regardless of if you just apply for the 3 game test, or the 7 game TST up to the final) are the amounts I listed above.  It certainly appears that you get the rest of your money back if you are otherwise unsuccessful.

x9GODf8eaa	Kind of. <br>  <br>  You have two options.<br>  1. You can attempt to put a blade in the bottom end of the shaft, but depending on where it is cut, the blade may not fit snuggly because of the taper and the bottom of the shaft. Hit and miss here.<br>  2. Take out the plug from the butt end, and put a blade in there. Guaranteed it will work, but depending on the taper at the top (where it was cut) it may not have the same feel.<br>  <br>  Overall, I don't like the feel of 2-pieces as one-pieces, but they do save you money in the long run because it will usually break at the blade, meaning a small replacement, instead of a 200 one-piece stick.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Same thing happened to one of my CCM VECTOR sticks awhile back. I was able to fit a standard blade on the other end to create a 2-piece you may be able to fit a tapered one where the blade WAS on your stick before it broke = but I am not 100% certain of this.|`|7Mot5ifjaa	sme i had a vapor xx but it wont fell the sme even if u got same brand blad and same lie patterrn and every thin im sory but its easy to get use to

AA12022123	pats<br>  colts<br>  steelers|`|pANpZ3vaaa	Currently I would have to say that it is the Pats, but the team of the year title should not go to who has the most superbowl wins.  It should go to who has been consistently winning more games and going to the playoffs more than others.<br>  <br>  In any case I would have to say it is still the Pats.  But the year is not over yet.  If the Steelers manage to win another lombardi trophy next season or even get to the superbowl, I would go with the STEELERS!<br>  <br>  I'm a steeler fan and I say it is the PATS.  A lot of people who are dissing the steelers are just plain HATERS!!!  A lot of Steeler fans will tell you it is the PATS!<br>  <br>  Also if you hate on the steelers, you should also think that if it wasn't for Vinatierri's last minutes kicks in two superbowls, the PATS would have been nothing right now.Look what happened to them last year, they went 18-0 until the superbowl and then collapsed.

I like competition and I like to show people how a winner can just step out of nowhere and beat the "big guys". That's what racing is about. I once turned down an offer to have a chance to work on a pit crew.

SFKw0FhWaa	Absolutely! Both teams are ranked backed to back in the top 25 (although pitt should be higher becuase of their RPI ranking and strength of schedule). Anyway....<br>  <br>  DeJuan Blair and Tyler Hansbrough would be a great match-up because even though Blair is a smaller Center, he can still frustrate and dominate the opposition. Most big-guys for top ranked teams think they can handle him and then just get beat up (((think Blair (22 pts, 23 rebounds) vs Hasheem Thabeet (5 pts, 4 rebounds) and the latter was supposed to be the best Center in the country)<br>  <br>  Levance Fields could match Ty Lawson on Defense and is quick enough to school him offensively<br>  <br>  And, in my opinion, is better than both Danny Green and Deon Thompson<br>  <br>  UNC would have the advantage on the other side with either Green or Thompson being better than Tyrell Biggs<br>  <br>  <br>  All in all though, I think Roy Williams has the experience to help him out, but I think Jamie Dixon is a better coach all around.|`|GmYM3CLwaa	i think north carolina would make it look like a slaughter fest  i mean pitt plays in the Big East no competion while North Carolina plays in the ACC where you got teams like wake forest and duke|`|cWsBSpQNaa	no uconn and north carolina|`|6yoQhXsOaa	north carolina will not make the championship game in the first place!|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	Hansbrough and Blair will cancel each other out. Lavance Fields can not keep Ty Lawson from getting to the basket and Pitt doesn't have enough fire power coming off the bench. UNC gets 77 points per game from their starters. Pitt is averaging 78 as a team and UConn 76.6. I think UConn would match up better with UNC because they have Thabeet in the middle and he will alter some shots and keep Lawson from getting to the rim. They also have guards that move well on defense. Lavance Fields is too stubby. Hansbrough wouldn't be affected tough. He can face up and shoot the jumper and so can Thompson. I think it could be close early but if UNC dictated the tempo, they would pull away late against UConn. I don't think the Pitt match up would even be close.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	it sure will|`|AA11511615	Not as good as UNC VS UCONN.  I am from North Carolina, but cannot stand the Tarheels, so I will pull for whoever they play against.
8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	There are tons of good ones.  Consult a high end bike shop that caters to triathletes.

wKMCI1azaa	is very rare to see leg sweeps on a Muay Thai fight and is very dangerous if you are not fast a Muay thai fighter will love you to try a sanda leg sweep.he will knock you out as soon you stand up. this sweeps are only effective in the street because they do not expect you to do it is only a surprise technique only if you master it. i use it against oponents that are boxers or stand up fighters but not against a Muay thai fighter.

kzYdVfifaa	Basically because there Duke. What i mean by this is that Duke historically is known as good. They don't want that taken from them. Personally Duke's dynasty is slowlly but surely declining. Duke is not Top 10 personel, but because they have the name Duke, they want Duke to stay Duke. Like 2 years ago, when they dropped out of the Top 25. They beat St. Johns to get back to 18. See, People say Duke and think greatest dynasty in college basketball. The NCAA commission does it's best to protect them|`|Jtt6SaVIaa	They suck and Dickie V loves Duke. Otherwise they would be in the trash can with Ohio St.|`|mwxKnUleaa	Because they are in the ACC and have some good wins|`|cWsBSpQNaa	because they are good|`|NWXBqftkaa	UNC #1. Ship Ship Ship.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	I hate Duke also but timing and strength of schedule have a lot to do with it. They've lost to 5 teams, all who have been ranked during one point of this season. Three of them were ranked in the top 10. So in losing to good teams you don't fall that far in the rankings. It also helps when you lose when you're in the top 5. They've lost 3 games while ranked in the top 5. Next, it helps when other teams in the top 10 lose. Last, if you look at the rest of the top 25, Marquette, Missouri, Clemson, Xavier, Butler, LSU and Dayton are the teams with fewer losses than Duke. Clemson killed Duke so they could make an argument and possibly Marquette but those other teams probably aren't as good as Duke. As far as UNC is concerned, they are considered the favorites to win it all because of their talent and potential. It is assumed that they will get it together eventually and when they do, they will be unbeatable.|`|i5MInqeMaa	East coast biased and ACC biased that's why.  If you replaced duke with a PAC 10 team they wouldn't even be in the top 20.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Because there is not 9 teams better than them this season.

The Diamondbacks and Giants can do that deal.|`|gMTatFZBaa	Yeah, nothign the BJs want to do more than acquire some big contracts and dead weight in place of one of the best pitchers in the AL. <br>  <br>  You see, this is why the general public doesn't make trades. Why would the BJs do this terrible trade?|`|eZsBPaRSaa	If Jays would ever trade Halladay they would want a good SP and a good solid hitter to hit 4 in the line up<br>  <br>  <br>  As of know they wont trade him|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Good Deal. The Dodgers will get more solid pitching.|`|oyq0vrWNaa	Yeah right...|`|vuh0i3Axaa	no way...<br>  <br>  that will never happen...<br>  <br>  never....
S0u3HKzhaa	No Matt was face,MVP was heel.And would make up the excuse and cheat as Matt was face and played fair etc.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No...he was still a heel at that time, and Hardy was a face|`|TzCu3igraa	no, they were rivals<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgB5NH09J1w5xN.Wb5RevcpMxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220114840AAHmON3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dgXKvb7haa	No,he was just being a suck up to Matt Hardy.Matt Hardy was face and was a rival to MVP.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	MVP was a heel and Hardy was a face|`|zXpbfBcuaa	no|`|p3EOSY8Eaa	Matt was face, MVP wasn't. You can usually tell the difference easily cause heels will talk back to the crowd or brag. Baby-faces don't do that crap.|`|kHLWDgmIaa	no ... mvp was a heel when he teamed up with Matt Hardy|`|AA10957632	he was a heel but Hardy had his number
p3EOSY8Eaa	HELL YEAH! but not for the WWE title, maybe for the Intercontinental or United States title. Nothing offensive to Shawn, but he's a bit too old to  be holding a belt of that caliber. He might end up having to surrender it(AGAIN!) due to medical reasons. But he doesn't actually care about the "10lbs of gold" anymore, he wrestles sourly for the thrill of exciting the fans. To be 100% honest, Shawn is one of my favorites of all time an a childhood role model.|`|GZc2hVWtaa	i dont|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	To the person above who said Jeff Hardy would win must be an idiot, and they also said they want HBK gone? Shawn Michaels is a legend, and a veteran, Jeff also is a veteran(belive it or not he is, he has been in the WWE for ten years) But to say Jeff would beat HBK is a joke.|`|qt7QcmtPaa	Nah Jeff would win anway I want HBK gone thish Wrestlemania.|`|bwvWunTgaa	That would be a good main event for raw or smackdown or even the wwe champ match at royal rumble but its not good enough for wm 26. It should be jeff vs hbk vs hhh vs undertaker vs cena vs austin vs the rock hell in a cell.|`|gVCZlEPIaa	that would be an ok match i would rather see matt hardy vs jeff hardy in a no holds barred match|`|4HTn6LPhaa	sounds interesting but i wont want to see it that much|`|FtKPPsdWaa	No thank you.
7dJvSe2Raa	It was not a good start for the Aussie bowlers even though it was a flat pitch I think they should have been more effective.<br>  <br>  McGain certainly did not have a great day I read he pitched short a lot which for a bowler who was said to be fairly accurate is unforgivable at this level if he repeats this performance vs the Proteas his figures will be a lot worse plus SA pitches have never been to spin friendly but after this performance I honestly don't see how he is going to trouble our batting line up.<br>  <br>  I think the Aus pace bowlers may have better conditions in the test matches where the pitches should do a bit and help them but it does seem even though its only a warm up they need to start getting it right more often than not to trouble the Protea batting line-up.|`|Eq6LEVq0aa	It's certainly not a good start for McGain and for the Aussie team. I feel like just winning this tour match will give them a good confidence boost. If they get hammered in this tour match, you can guarantee they'll come into the first test very cautiously which is not how Australia play best. Hopefully the Aussie batsmen can put on a show in this tour match because right now i think the South Africans are watching this with a smile.|`|KbzXg3hfaa	Playing spin on this ground was never a good idea anyway - at best he could have bowled perfectly and only been a bit more economical.<br>  <br>  The ground is not conducive for even good spin bowlers so unless he has a very thick skin it will only hurt his confidence and spook the Aussie selectors.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	The similarities with the opening match in India are spooky...not a good sign. No!....We will win, the West Indies ( when they ruled the cricket world) always lost their tour openers against Western Australia and then rolled the Aussies.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	That wasn't a very auspicious beginning I must admit. I don't hold out too much hope for the series.|`|AA11088802	may be hes experimenting something
Ekx7G30jaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Jokingly, I am going to say a trap range.  LOL!  I just couldn't resist the tempation.  Now that I got that out of my system, I can proceed.  <br>  <br>  I found 3 ranges.  I think they're in your area.  I have never been to Oregon.  You might want to try sporting clays.  It's a lot of fun.  They call it golf with a shotgun because there are usually 10 to 12 stations per round (100 shots).  Each represents a different type of game, one could be ducks, another could be quail, etc.  Each station has a different target presentation.  The targets could be high or low, incoming, outgoing or side to side.  There is even a rabbit station where there's a stronger clay that rolls on the ground. It's more expensive, about $35 per round of 100 plus shells. but it's a heck of a lot of fun.  <br>  <br>  Check these places out first.  If these aren't close enough, perhaps they can find one for you.  They're usually pretty good about that.<br>  <br>  CENTRAL OREGON SPORTING CLAYS<br>  Cossa Range Millican<br>  Bend,OR 97701<br>  (541) 382-5663<br>   <br>  MEDFORD GUN CLUB<br>  1259 E Vilas Rd<br>  Central Point,OR 97502<br>  (541) 772-7817<br>   <br>  COTTAGE GROVE EUGENE SPORTSMEN<br>  81078 N Pacific Hwy<br>  Creswell,OR 97426<br>  11.8MI from Eugene<br>  (541) 942-2021 <br>  <br>  There's no where close to shoot where i live. it's a good 45 minute drive to the nearest one.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RjUWPz5daa	Here's a listing of places to shoot in Oregon.
TeNIStN1aa	There are no real permanent solutions. However, there are temporary solutions that will get you through the day (or night).<br>  <br>  1) Keep your bait inside a cooler when not in use.<br>  2) Take your dog fishing. (Not recommended if your dog is a real killer)<br>  3) Flash them with a bright flash light. This will work on many birds at night. (Flashing worked better than a steady beam of light)<br>  4) Bring a spray bottle filled with water. When birds come close, squirt them directly between the eyes! If you can't get them between the eyes, any other part of the body will also do the trick.<br>  <br>  PS: I recommend option number four. Its a "blast".|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Permanently?  No.  It is their nature to take advantage of any opportunity to eat, and the easiest methods to do so appeal to them most....even if it means stealing bait from humans.  My method to keep ducks and other birds from stealing my bait is to "dust" them with a pocket of sand launched from a wrist-rocket slingshot.  They don't like it and get the hint real quick.  Just be sure you do not use larger projectiles because you are dealing with federally protected migratory waterfowl and the penalty for harassing them can get rather spendy...especially if you accidentally injure or kill one.  Sand works and is free for the taking.  A little sand in their craw may take the sand out of your craw about bait-stealing birds.  Good luck.|`|5O1YTpYmaa	shoot them!
zg1lIy7Oaa	Point Guard. I played Forward when I was 12 y/o and I was 5'7" then.|`|u2Afg0IFaa	That's everything a Guards have to do, dribble, shoot, pass, be fast. Everything else is what a forward would be. Your height is what a guard should be. Exactly your a guard!|`|AA11477361	Play the 2 or 3 for now. Work on your handles and your court vision incase you dont get much taller. Point Guard might be your only option later on in life.|`|ZSAVHC84aa	Pretty high opinion of yourself, eh? Well, if you're that great at everything then be PG, you're short.|`|A9etUnnfaa	you're a point guard......the shortest player the NBA was muggs bouges at 5'3|`|vuh0i3Axaa	bench warmer...<br>  <br>  sounds good, eh...|`|cWsBSpQNaa	point gaurd|`|vFbzBo4eaa	SF or SG|`|Lxj6kMklaa	You can be the waterboy/gatorade boy|`|2c9AGznmaa	1.this is a place for 13+<br>  2.your short<br>  3.dribbler?dont you mean handles?..<br>  4.quit now and play tennis<br>  <br>  EDIT:bench heater hahahahaha|`|GROkWyBAaa	The way you described yourself, you're definitely a bench warmer.

CBVlu3Gvaa	Golden Gloves???????Golfer receive colored jackets when they win some tournaments.....never heard of anybody getting a golden glove.|`|sBrummATaa	im not trying to be rude, but your in the wrong section. this is the golf section. you would get more answers that were correct in the wrestling section. and to answer your question, you could try looking it up on google. thats what i would do
AA11264943	Try looking up "Wolfslair" MMA.  I know it's in England, but don't know it's relation to Birmingham.  I imagine if you gave them a call they could help you out to find a place closer to you.<br>  <br>  James
