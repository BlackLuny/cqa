giKCTfnfaa	the information in the books and on the internet is based upon averages.  some women don't have pregnancy symptoms.  others say they experience them a few days after conception.  not every woman is the same.  it is very possible at 18 weeks you wouldn't look pregnant yet.   the 5 pounds is normal weight gain for 18 weeks.  one morning you'll wake up and poof, you'll have a baby bump.      if you have any concerns, ask a doctor, friend who has had a baby or even a mom or aunt.  stress is the worst thing for you, especially later in the pregnancy.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I was the same way...my doctor even told me that the baby is " a little on the small side" at my last checkup that made me almost at 21 weeks. I didn't gain a lot of weight until right around my 18th week. I still do not think I have felt the baby move and the doctor says "she's on the go" from what she can hear on the heart monitor. if you go to your doctors regularly and do what is told then you should be fine! try to relax, stress isn't good! good luck =)|`|o8xNTVWTaa	every women is different and its the same with every pregnancy ur fine iam sure the first kick and u will be feeling very pregnant and ur mind will be a ease. dont stress ur self out i know its scary but if u talk to ur dr iam sure he will clear ur mind of ur questions the kicking usually starts happening around 20 weeks   good luck and congrats|`|bLluZIeTaa	yea it is normal you will start feeling pregnant when you start to feel the baby move,which you should start to feel not to long from now,good luck|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	dont be worried unless you have bleeding and severe cramping.  all pregnancies are different and you cant believe everything you read from books and the internet.  i am 20 weeks and have only gained 2 pounds, like i said all pregnancies are different and if you are worried talk to your doctor next time.  im sure everything is just fine|`|xPfJG3FGaa	your fine i was the same way, i'm 8 months now, almost 35 weeks and sometimes i still don't feel pregnant, besides the fact i can't really tie my shoes, and i'm constantly getting kicked in the ribs, but sometimes it doesn't feel real, don't worry this is normal|`|1MEnCmwoaa	it is ok! i am almost 17 weeks with  2 and i even forget i am pregnant sometimes. though, i have felt faint movements every so often (but again this is  2 for me)   i have gained like 2 pounds only. i did that with my daughter also, and just ended making it up later on.   when you get your big ultrasound soon and see the baby more and if you want to find out the gender it makes it so much more real! then it is no longer an "it" and you can start really picking names and buying things etc... plus about 20 weeks or so you will start to show more (most likely)   i am in maternity pants but just look like i have a gut right now!  you are normal :)|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i didnt really 'feel pregnant' until about 20 - 22 wks. i had only gained about 7 lbs by this point too. i would say its normal. im 34 wks now and i feel VERY pregnant! it will come, i didnt really feel that 'connection' with the baby until about a month ago. now i play music for her to hear every night and im just now starting to buy baby stuff. im sure your fine, just first time mommy worries :)|`|Qkb35DIlaa	I was 6 months pregnant with my son and the only thing that let me know that I was pregnant was I went to intensive care because I wasn't feeling good I found out I had mono and I was pregnant at the same time. I think it's different for everybody.|`|Wjo2X9LRaa	Its normal... I didn't ever "Feel" pregnant! I knew I was pregnant, but I didn't "feel" it! Its totally normal. I didn't gain ANY weight while pregnant!    I didn't really "feel" pregnant until about 28 weeks. I actually, when I would feel the baby would remember, OH yeah, lol... I had him at 31 weeks though
6yYeCVQFaa	Yes. According to What to Expect when Expecting you do experience worse symptoms or magnified symptoms whenever you are expecting twins. I am not sure as to why this happens but I am assuming that there is an increase in HCG levels that make a person more sick than if they were just expecting one child.|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	yes!|`|Bw18seFqaa	not neccisarily..  everyone experiences symptoms differently..  even a woman who has had multiple pregnancies will experience each pregnancy differently.    Some people have a hard time with symptoms with just a single baby.. and some people have multiples with no problems.|`|OKSeZwV1aa	Your hormones are even stronger when you are carrying twins. So it seems as though you would get sicker and have more intense symptoms.
54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	No, not symptoms. Perfectly normal.|`|eM1kHW1saa	have ur nipples gone darker, are u having moodswings, are u fealing nautious, breats increased in size and become tender, bloated, need to urinate more often. those are signs of early pregnauncy|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	well...you would not be having those kind of symptoms if you are pregnant and you are in the very beginning...is it even possible you could be pregnant? meaning, haveyou had unprotected sex recently?...      your best bet is to go to your doctor.    good luck.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	No    your bladder is full|`|OKSeZwV1aa	This sounds totally normal... you have to pee you are not pregnant!
UJWVEI45aa	First thing is first please don't stress, its no good for u!!! second thing are your periods regular?    It sounds to me like you are pregnant, just because your test results are showing negatives trust me I have experienced it myself, I did 7 test before 1 finally showed positive and by then I was 10 weeks pregnant, I just wasn't showing enough HCG  hormone ( which u only produce when ur pregnant) for a home pregnancy test to pick it up, I would go to your doctor and talk to them, If they do a test and its still negative, wait about another 3 weeks and if there is still no sign of a period do another test, your HCG levels should be high enough by then to show up, The best pregnancy test to look for is one that test at about 20HCG or lower which u can get off the internet, look for an EARLY PREGNANCY TEST. You can have lots of false negative tests but NEVER a false posotive.  So if u can handle the wait a few more weeks then redo another test. Your doctor might offer you a blood test just to double check which will show you HCG levels easier than a hpt.  If you redo a test do it first thing in the morning as the level of HCG is higher as u won't of diluted it by drinking lots through out the day.    I hope this helps as I know exactly what your going through, just remember try not to get yourself all worked up.    x|`|yClEWLeKaa	I'm sure you're not pregnant.  The reason your period has been off lately is because of stress.  Normally when you worry about it, it seems like its been longer than usual since you had had your last period and the stress is making you exhausted so you're sleeping more.  And since you're only 17 your body is still getting used to it, after about 6-10 years a girls body will become familiar to the routine of having a period.  If you are truely worried you can go to the doctor.      Your breast may be sore and chapped from lack of nutrition because nutrition and vitamins and minerals all go out to help your body and whatever mineral or vitamin you're lacking, its affecting your breasts.  Try putting lotion on them, it could also be because of the cold weater.    Sweetie, please don't worry about it.  And if you just can't help but worry the best thing is go to a doctor because no one online is going to be able to fully know if you're pregnant or not unless they give you a check up.|`|Su0LaNhoaa	no your not pregnant your probably need more nutrition|`|Vsy7mMzKaa	girl why don't you go to the doctor and find out|`|hamdnq5Yaa	I would take a hpt. If you are that far along your test should come up positive. Make sure you read the directions well. It may be better to pee in a cup and then put the stick in the cup for as long as the directions recommend for testing with the cup. To much pee or to little pee may give you the wrong results.  You can go to the DR. for a exam  The Dr. can feel to see if your uterus has expanded or if your discolored inside. You can even get some blood work done to see what your hormone levels are.    Good luck and in the future try to find some kind of birth control that works for you.  Sometimes when we want to be pregnant our body's will act like it is pregnant. It is called false pregnancy. You can have nausea, food craving, breast tenderness and swelling, you can also have tummy growth that gives the appearance of a growing uterus. All the symptoms that you are have can be caused by may different things. NOT JUST PREGNANCY.    You have to see a doctor then because most people here on this site are not doctors. They use there own person experiences to help other people. No one here will be able to diagnose you with any kind of conditions.
1MEnCmwoaa	Just because you start dilating doesn't mean labor has to start soon. i started dilating at 35 weeks and didn't have my daughter until the 39th week.  plus, labor takes a few hours so as soon as you think you might be starting labor go to the hospital so it won't be emergency but just done quickly!  the people i knew who had planned c-sections were scheduled earlier than 39 weeks. one was at 38 and one at 37. but the one at 37 had to have an amnio done the day before to make sure the babies lungs were developed enough.   if you are concerned question your Dr more, they are there to help you.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Too much c-section is being done.  Too many drugs like pertosin.  Un necessary and dangerous.  Doctors want to keep things moving in and out so more beds are open.  Babies have to come on their schedule.  More painful, babies all drugged up coming out.  All for convenience and Big big money.  It is wrong to believe surgery is safer than natural.  Surgery is more dangerous.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It is perfectly fine that you are dilating- they can still do a c-section.  Sometimes in an emergency a woman is pushing at 10 cm and ends up needing a c-section.  They want to do it as close to 40 weeks as possible to give the baby the best chance at not having any complications.  They don't like to do them at 37 weeks if they don't have to.  There are cases where they do not want the woman to go into labor for whatever reason so they will do a c-section at 37 weeks to prevent this, but it doesn't sound like they are worried about this with you.  Relax- your doctor knows more about this than your friend does.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Why are they doing a c-section?|`|70kh6VSoaa	my cusin had a c section with all 3 of her kids but they say after you have one every time you have a baby it has to be like that so maybe thats why|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would personally think that if you are going into labor, then um yea they should take the baby so that you dont have to have an emergency c-section. I too have to have one and my doc told me that they were going to plan on taking the baby at 39 weeks but if I happen to go into labor before that then they need to take him so that it wont be an emergency. I had my first son by c-section at 37 weeks and he was fine I was dilated 2cm|`|KOwzDLPdaa	With my second baby, my section was planned and at 36 weeks I was 2 cm dilating with irregular contractions. As long as your contractions are not causing further dilation you will be alright but if the contractions keep up for 24 hours and don't become regular, I'd still go into the hospital if I were you. You're far enough along now that you should be seeing your doctor weekly so if you can't wait for the appt and are really worried, call them.|`|75HzIpSraa	Waiting until 39 weeks is normal, they really shouldn't do it before that unless need be!  I started to have contractions and dilate before mine too.  Your doc is right in not doing it early unless your water breaks or they are 5 min apart!  Hang in there mama, you're almost there!!!|`|eVPyTfqxaa	Yes, once you begin to dilate then they are supposed to do the c-section. I was scheduled with my daughter at 39 wks and 1 day but a week and a half earlier I was in the office for a check and I was telling my Dr. that I was having strong contractions and he said he wanted to check me because if I was dilating even to 1cm then that would warrant a c-section. So if you are having contractions and are dilating  (that you know of) I would recommend going into L&D because you don't want to wait to long. Good luck!
Xrwvu5Uraa	if that is something that you have been experiencing since week 4 and you have not talked to your doctor/miwife about it, then you should!!!    until then, maybe take tylenol, which is completely safe during pregnancy and try to relax...|`|AA11828121	It's your siatic(probably spelled wrong) nerve, it usually happens furthur in pregnancy but i've been having the problem since I was 10 weeks. My OB said it's from the pressure of the baby and it's normal and pretty much something you have to deal with....    You can take tylenol.|`|6yYeCVQFaa	I have been told not to sit or stand for long periods of time. I have horrible abdominal pains if I sit to long. Try changing your position often and maybe getting more exercise. I am 11 weeks so we will be giving birth around the same time. :)|`|eeyGYRcPaa	my pelvis and vagina area hurts if i sit a certain way for too long. my doctor told me it was the pressure of my uterus on my pelvis bone when i sit that way and suggested sitting with my legs stretched out, my pelvis tilted with pillows propped behind my back. and usually that helps but sometimes the only thing that helps is laying on my left side. i hope i helped!
GCcQPzD6aa	I would say you were more than likely pregnant. As tests can show a false negative result but it is very unlikely to show a false positive, and for you to have had two positive tests I would say it would be more or less impossible. The doctor will be able to tell you for sure when you see them. As for the test being out of date, im realy not sure what difference this would make to the results. hope all goes well and you get the result you hoped for off doctor.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I have not experienced the same thing as you but quite the opposite. My at home pregnancy test (digital) said clearly "Not Pregnant" and in fact, I was. You should go to your doctor because at-home tests aren't 100%. Your doctor is the one that could tell you for sure. Good luck, I hope you get the outcome you want!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	if you took two preg. tests, i would say that you are very much pregnant.    i had to take three to be sure myself haha.    i would go ahead and set up an appt with a womens health care dr as soon as you leave your drs monday.    congratulations!|`|6yYeCVQFaa	Have you miscarried recently? Did you have a period this month? If so, then you could be getting a false-positive because the HCG levels might be high enough to be picked up by the test.    Test out of date....um may produce a false-positive as well    None of these? Congrad's!!!! Just hang in there, the fun part of morning sickness comes next and my thoughts are with you during this time.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	The test most certainly could be faulty.  Especially if it is expired.  Read the information in this link.    http://www.pregnancy-due-date.com/gettin...    I would check the box and packaging and find the expiration date.  Just because it's 4 months old doesn't mean it's expired, however if it is, it is very likely you have just gotten a falso positive.  Go buy a brand new test off the store self and first thing in the a.m. go test again just to be sure.|`|iv0aR3DRaa	The likelihood of a false positive is very unlikely. The test being out of date would more likely give you a false negative that a false positive. In fact, most doctor's offices use a very basic urine test!  However, some doctor's will send you for a blood test to see if your Hcg levels are on the rise.  For the time being, I would assume that the test are accurate and behave as such.      Good luck!!

44OH7Si6aa	Yes it is okay for a doctor to induce early, many people do it. But the decision is up to you, if you would rather wait for the baby to come naturally then say so. Doctors like to induce because that makes it easier on them. Plus side: you know when your baby is coming and can make arrangements with family members who would like to see the baby after birth and you know your doctor will be there and you won't get whoever is on call delivering the baby. Down side: it's possible the induction won't work and you'll be sent home disappointed.  You also won't have the excitement/ordeal (depending how you view it) of rushing to the hospital while in labor.  It's your decision though, if you have doubts then wait, your Doctor won't force you.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	that's bizarre. The only reasons Ive heard of women being induced a week early is b/c if the baby is at risk if "left in there" or the mother is like pre-eclampsia etc. My SIL got induced at 39 weeks bc she has type 1 diabetes and they speculated that if my niece was born any later, she could be a stillborn. So they induced her, and my niece came out a healthy 8 lb baby. I think that's a really lame reason to induce you, and you dont have to agree to it. I'm sure your baby will be fine born at 39 weeks, but it could make your labor more difficult if your body really isnt ready. I BEGGED my ob to induce me when I became 3 days overdue, and she STILL insisted on "waiting and seeing" then finally scheduled me for one on july 11th at 9 days overdue.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Definitely, I can believe that statement.....hospitals get busy, etc.    It's a money making scheme and your doc is making it convenient FOR HIM (high class Jerk)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Yes.   Certain times people have lots of babies.   I was sent home in labor to dilate more....because they had no room for me.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Heck I would be happy!! A week early is not going to hurt the baby at all, be happy that you have a cool doctor that will let you have the baby a week early!|`|SRzswqTeaa	Convenience for the hospital and the doctor is NOT a good reason to put you and your baby in jeopardy.  Inductions are not without risk, they are not 100% safe for you and your baby.  You walk in the door for an induction, and you can expect a 1 in 4 chance of ending up with a cesarean section.  Pitocin (the meds they use to induce you),  causes abnormal contractions..longer, stronger and it can cause you and the baby stress.  Pitocin also shuts off all of your bodies natural hormones that you have during normal labor (unmedicated), which produces both physical and emotional benefits for you and the baby.  Bonding is stronger, babies tend to be a bit healthier, the list goes on.  You can read all the pros and cons of inductions at my blog here:  http://thebirthteacher.blogspot.com/2008...|`|70kh6VSoaa	sounds fine to me congrads|`|zcSAWWCkaa	its fine. my friend is due on march 10th (3days before me!) but is having a c-section on feb 25. i personally would love to be induced a little early, im so ready.|`|75HzIpSraa	None of the docs around here would do that, maybe the hospitals are highly different! It not's usually in the babes best interest to induce, especially early, for no reason!|`|pRF5LLloaa	Only a week??? yeah, that's fine.    You are better off inducing a week early, and having good care than to deliver on time and have less-than-good care.    Sounds like the doctor is right on top of things.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I don't think it is right at all.  Your doctor is taking your baby out before she is ready because the hospital gets busy?    I'd be pissed if my doctor put my baby's health and well being AFTER what is convient for the adults.  Sure, a week early probably won't be that bad...but there's a reason babies come when they are ready.  My doc has already been very clear that she doesn't even consider inducing until we reach the end of week 42.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i was induced a week early but because my blood pressure was too high.  my baby was fine a week early and didnt have any problems but i will tell you that i ended up having a c- section because my body wasnt ready.  even with lots of pitocin and breaking my water they could not get my labor going and i didnt dialate, finally for the babies sake they did a c-section after 13 hours of painful useless contracions.  it wasnt a terrible experience and my c -section went just fine, but if i had a choice i wouldnt agree to being induced for no reason, your body and the baby knnow when its time.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	that is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard your doctor is an idiot. it is much better for you to go into labour yourself as being induced can be a lot more painful as your contractions are drug induced it is better for nature to take it's course i would tell the doctor that if they suggested it to me. unless there are problems they shouldn't create them unless there is a medical reason to do so.  i think it is unprofessional of your doctor to put their convenience before your needs and possible side effects to your baby. when your baby is ready to face the world it will.  i don't mean to scare you as the risk of being induced is very minimal but the difference in the onset of labour to your body is not.   natural labour takes a gradual hold of you so your body is able to adapt to the increasing level of pain involved usually with inducement you have very strong pains from the beginning and there is no gradual build up. especially when this is your first baby this can make it a very unpleasant memory of what labour should be like.  good luck whatever happens but i hope they let you go into labour on your own it will be better for you.|`|LABC73E7aa	ummm like others say i would love to be in your shoes!! but it sounds like ur doctor is trying to take the easy way and most costly way out. he or she isnt thinking of u or the baby. my doctor wont induce me early cause she says my cervix isnt favorable yet and to wait til im overdue. if u feel uncomfortable about it tell your doctor. cause im sure the hospital will find room for u if they are full! the nurse at the hospital told me that they clear out operating rooms to fit pregnant woman in sometimes! but im sure it would suck to be there if the maternity ward is that busy!|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	There will be no harm in doing this.     It may be to your doctors advantage or it may be what he told you about a full hospital.     If you are going to be induced why not just get a c-section? It will be faster, easier (for you), and much less stressful for everyone, including the baby. That pitocin is painful for mom and makes babie's hear rate go up. Then you'll probably have all of this drama with the pitocin, and dilating, or not dilating, and end up have a c-section anyway.     I just had an elective c-section and it was smooth and stress-free. Plus I got to deliver 2 weeks early. I'm glad I went that route.|`|UDX7yqD2aa	My opinion is no. Due dates are just an estimate and are rarely exact.   There are so many risks involved in having an induction.  You don't know for a fact that baby is ready to come out and there's always the risk of a c-section or a multitude of other complications.  Your body knows what's best. Trust it.   Hospitals are notorious for doing this. So are doctors. With my daughter they wanted to induce me a week early. I refused then found out later that he was leaving for vacation the week I was due. I'm not saying this is the case in your situation. Just be careful. Doctors don't always know best.   My daughter was born 16 days late and perfectly healthy.   I would definitely hold on a while longer.|`|ai5PkbeLaa	Unless there is a problem with the baby or your self, you should carry the baby full term. Even if it is only a week, there is no reason to put either you or the baby under unnecessary stress.(Read the bottom of page three.)
0nb1rQhnaa	I know you can't hold your baby all day long (you have to use the bathroom once in awhile). When we weren't holding our baby he laid in his Boppy. Just throw a towel or blanket over it to make a sort of sling. That way he is safe to lay by himself (he shouldn't be alone) and his head will be elevated and not laying flat on the floor.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	Just don't leave him on his back all day.  If he's carried a lot (especially in a sling), he won't be laying down and won't have a chance to develop flat head.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Give him tummy time through out the day that will help make his head not flat in the back|`|KNxs4PrZaa	just make sure you are holding him alot and giving him some tummy time, its usually babies who are constantly left on their back, in swings and playmats etc  all day.   I am not saying not to use those things they are a life saver! just dont rely on them all day long make sure your baby is being moved into different positions during the day. Still make sure to have your baby sleeping on his back, that is the safest!|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	you can prevent it by not only putting him to sleep on his back but on his side too which is also safe in preventing sids with a infant sleep positioner, in the day carrying your baby close to you in a sling or front carrier, letting your baby get a lot of tummy time, and also dont keep your baby in swings and car seats all day that adds pressure to their head...|`|0n5sYl6raa	I was so worried when my lil one was 2 mo and did ask this qn to moms in this forum.And guess what,she is 7 mnths now and her head is getting to be shaped. Kids will roll over and lie on thier sides and eventualy, the head will become to be of proper shape.Dont worry Mom :-)|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	Don't let him lay flatt for hours on end.  If you hold him, pick him up and play with him through out the day and only keep him laying down either while napping or for short periods he should be fine.  The flat head is from the baby not being able to move there head as much as they should and it lays in one spot.  Thus the skull from the pressure from the head flattens in that area.  This can happen to adults in ICU in the hospital except it's the skin that gets mushy and flat and breaks down not the skull it's self.|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	when  your babies laying on his back and if he's asleep carefully turn it to the side you could lay him on the floor thrughout the day on a blanky on his tummy like while your sitting and watching tv also by holding your baby lots who doesn't love holding a cute little baby :p you can also when he falls asleep for a nap lay him down on his side and if he wants to kinda like roll back on his back take a pillow and kinda prop it against his back depending on the thickness and type of pillow you may need to use more than one you kinda want him to be leaning back against the pillows but still pretty much all the way on his side i'm sure you know wat i mean but usually if it does appear to be a little flat in the back of the head as a baby it wont stay like tht as he gets older and his head gets harder|`|MOPXWu33aa	When he is about to sleep,keep him on his side.If he is used to sleep on his back,he will try to be on his back. Then gently turn him on his  side stroke his back gently and sing or hum a lullaby till he is fast asleep.Then keep two pillows by his sides,cover him so that he will be  quite cozy.Slide the window curtains in the room to avoid bright light.Then rest for some time till he is sleeping.             Best of luck and know that this is the happiest time of your life as you are nurturing your baby-boy.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yes it is bad;  and if you are holding your baby he shouldnt be lying on the back of his head all day....google 'noggin nest' by boppy to use in bouncys and swings, but hold the baby a lot, give him tummy time, etc....so it doesn't get flat...put him in a baby carrier if u need your hands free, he will appreciate being that close to you..|`|YmEGCGtnaa	lots of tummy time during the day.  but even if it does get flat spots, it will go away as he begins to crawl, etc.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	hold him lots   nd lots of tummy time  but always put him on his back 2 sleep|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Honestly, the only way a baby's head could be permanently disfigured like that would be if a person left that baby on their back 24/7.    However, make sure you're picking him up and playing with him occasionally. If he's laying down, try turning his head so he's resting on one side; then, if he's there a while, try turning it the other way.    Tummy time is important, as well, once he starts to want to hold his head up and look around.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	chances are hes going to end up with somewhat of a flat spot because your suppose to keep him on the back when sleeping. my son was NEVER on his back during the day, always on his belly he lovedi t. or in his jumperoo and he still got one becasue he slept 11 hours straight at night, on his back.

If you have regular menstrual periods and are sexually active, you can become pregnant, even if you use birth control.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	omg is this serious that would mean u would have a 2 years old toddler in ur uterus NO u are not pregnant|`|U7oJrc3faa	NO.

eemmWU0Haa	I gave in and took a test 4 days b4 my period was due and its was negative, but today I had cramps and some brown and abit of red, suppose to start my period the 2nd of Feb now all of a sudden it stopped and I got nothing Im hoping its not my period but then again It could be it...bummer|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I've had that feeling constantly since my doctor told me I could potentially conceive without having a period (coming off depo-provera). I've been hoping to conceive since last May, but, like I said, no period yet, so it's pretty unlikely for now. And my husband said a couple days ago that he wants to stop trying for a year or so, so pretty unlikely anytime soon, actually.    Well, good luck to you. I don't see why you couldn't test now. If it's positive, yay, and if it's negative, wait a little longer and try again.|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Yeah I am five days late and I test on 14 dpo and nothing and 16 dpo and nothing.  I am going to retest again tomorrow.  It is possible to not get a positive for a week or more after you miss your period.  I hope you get your BFP this month.  Best of luck and lots of baby dust.|`|sfYY9QGVaa	I was 21 days late for AF, and had 8..... make sure you see that EIGHT positive urine home tests, but went for blood twice and both times was negative...finally had u/s done as well and negative...but I had every symptom you could possibly think of. Until it comes out positive on an u/s I don't believe any test, blood or urine.|`|BCGhOGQPaa	yea i had the feeling on both my kids   the first i was like i no im pregnant i just no i am dint even get to miss my period i said it to my dad ( iwas 17 at the time) and up to the dotor i went   second  i just kept sayin it to my husband and on valentine`s day 6 years ago i found out i was   which it was a great day for me as it was also my birthday ..|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I am in the same boat has you are. I am always on time with my period and my last was on dec 28 . My cycle is 30-31 days and I am late. I took a test a few days ago but it said negative. I want to test again but I am just going to wait to see if my period comes later. Good luck to you. Baby dust,|`|AfSwDFRcaa	LOL I know how you feel. My last period was 1/1/09 and it shouldv'e arrived on the 29th or so. On the 16th through the 19th I had a very strange and light 'period'. My friend who has a 2 month old baby told me that it happens in early pregnanacy and is totally convinced that im preggo. But that's what is throwing me off now... I dont know what to think. Been feeling really crappy lately and getting cramps but every time i check AF is not here. I tested on the 29th but it was negative. The Doc told me it might be too early. I hope that I am and I will be so disappointed if AF shows!
Xrwvu5Uraa	well if you have chlamyda then you should tell your boyfriend!!!!  usually they give you pills for that by the way.  you should definitely be going to an OB-GYN if you are sexually active no matter your age.    a lot of STDs do not give you symptoms and signs that they are present or that you have them, that's why routine checkups at your doctor are essential.    HIV can only be tested through a blood test not a pap smear, so you should probably schedule one of those ASAP.    You are freaking out a little too much, I know it's something that is probably making you very scared but I'm sure everything will be okay you just need to see a doctor regularly.    You can not treat EVERY single STD, no. AIDS/HIV is a virus and virus' can not be treated, along with Herpes and HPV(Human Papillomavirus) can not be treated as well. HPV is very common among woman, keep in mind. 1 out of 3 woman have HPV and or have had. Sometimes your body can fight if off. Syphillis, Gonnorhea, and Chlamydia though have been proven to be cured. If you are tested to HPV and come back negative you should get the vaccine known as Gardisil to protect you from that.    Good luck =)|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Ok- please don't ever use the word "nut" again unless you are referring to the kind that you eat, and take a deep breath and calm yourself down.  You don't have to worry about any of those other STDs until you find out for sure if you have them or not.  Some STDs are treatable and will be gone with a course of medications.  Others you will have for the rest of your life.  Just make sure that you are seeing your gynecologist regularly and that you are doing everything she says.  Always use condoms from now on and confront your boyfriend about cheating on you and tell him that he also needs to seek treatment.
giKCTfnfaa	when i had braxton hicks contractions, they seemed to be mostly in the abdomen.  the were a lot like period cramping...nothing really painful, just uncomfortable.  at 37 weeks, the baby is running out of room.  everything is pushed up and squished.  because of this, many women have problems breathing towards the end of pregnancy.  if it's something you are concerned about, ask your doctor.  that's what he/she is there for.|`|oIFMohfUaa	Yes...it does make sense!  Are you sure they are contractions?    It could be just some anxiety.  It could also be your blood sugar trying to regulate.  My daughter just went through that!  Turns out she was borderline gestational diabetes.      Just give your dr a call and ask.      Is your blood pressure good?  It can also be that you are just so full of baby that your oxygen is low and your body is shaky.      Then again, it could just be one of those quirky pregnancy things... with no explanations!  LOL!    Good luck~|`|tbMV3yOFaa	I sure remember feeling that way.  I had to stand up all the time at work because I would get out of breath that same way.  Then I would soon have to sit down cause I was so tired!  I also went into labor at 38 weeks.  Good Luck!

It is pronounced Cora-line though.    I like Koraline Jayne the best out of the names you listed.|`|NPjF1t28aa	I honestly like Koraline (Coraline) Joyce.  good luck and congrats!|`|U49so236aa	Wtf is Kroline|`|bzkSIJYnaa	i think Coraline is so pretty! I prefer it pronounced core-ah-line, rather than core-ah-leen. And I like the spelling Coraline better than Koraline. It looks classier. Coraline Marie and Coraline Jayne.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Anything but Kroline. Sorry, but thats awful.
giKCTfnfaa	baby probably has the hiccups!|`|AA11210211	Hiccups maybe or a light punch,My daughter use to ball her fist up and punch me and it would feel like that.|`|9FbcLKsfaa	baby might have hiccups, i get that thumping a lot when my lil one has hiccups!|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i dont know what it is but im 34wks and have the same feelings. its like a constant rhythmic vibration almost. its kinda annoying when im trying to sleep. maybe hiccups but i dont know.|`|cSm1zod4aa	Sounds like hiccups! I love when my baby gets them, its so cute. Nothing to worry about!!|`|qmmu6hv5aa	Those are hiccups..i get them everyday now that i'm 37 weeks. The first time i was like aww how cute, now its like ok get it over with because they get really obnoxious and keep me awake.
MzqZGvalaa	My son is nearly 15. (had him at 26)  I will be 42 in May.  I always wanted another child but had a few miscarriages, then nothing - until at 39 I fell pregnant, had the baby at 40.  No complications, and now I have a pigeon pair, I got my girl!!!!   Jeez I had to wait a while though.  There seemed to be no reason I wasn't falling and my partner has 5 other kids, so it wasn't him!   Who knows why these things happen or don't happen?  I know a lady who didn't fall after 10 years of marriage, and adopted 2 little ones, then fell pregnant and had two healthy boys, one after the other.  Another friend of mine spent $40,000 in the early 80's on IVF treatment and had twins,  then a year later fell pregnant naturally and had a son!!!  Mother nature has a weird sense of humour.   Don't lose hope, sometimes these things take time.  But it's worth the wait.  If you're really worried (and that won't help you know - worry) go see a health care professional.  Chinese herbalist have an amazing reputation for success with this kind of thing - and look how many Chinese there are!! ha ha.   Some women have reported success when using the 'Circadian Diet' which was developed by a doctor - it's called the 'The body clock diet' in the UK.  Can't hurt anyway hey?  Good luck darl, I hope it works out for you-just don't despair.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, you can.  Maybe your husband has a low sperm count - get him checked out!|`|iwYu32N2aa	my aunt was 40 when she got pregnant with my cousin. I think this is a question for a doc|`|v9rzGYWoaa	You may want to have him checked out. If your dr is saying that your healthy it may be him.|`|kxSz1PYmaa	My husband is 10 years younger than I am and we just assumed it was me.  I am 40 as well.  Had all the tests ran and everything was fine, so he went in and it was low count with slow swimmers.  They told us to get these vitamins from GNC called Fertility Blend for him and we were pregnant within 3 weeks after trying for 5 years.  Luckily this was a specialist that told us to try this before starting the expensive treatments.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Firstly i would get your hubby to have a check up then you know you are both fertile,once you know that there is no reason why you cant get pregnant but fertility does decrease as you get older so it might just take longer.|`|6yYeCVQFaa	Yes it is possible but so are the risks. The older the egg the higher the risks for complications. I would out weigh the risks before trying to get pregnant. Sadly, I have worked with handicapped children for many years and know how much trouble and how sad it is for the parents. God bless and best of luck.|`|gz7YVvKlaa	I would try some fertility enhancing pills if you haven't been able to get pregnant. And yes its very possible. My mom had my sister at 43 and she had my brother at 48.
jsdDgIuRaa	You mean like the people who hoard cats or dogs but rather a "kid hoarder"  ? LOL    Quite possible.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	When my aunt said to me the other day that she would have loved to have 14 kids, i nearly choked on my cereal...mental.|`|PsN79isyaa	She will be once the media destroys her, and her family.|`|gz7YVvKlaa	I think the people with 18 kids and counting are mentally disturbed.|`|cbDfpfYKaa	It's sad, but there is definitely a problem here.  She has 6 kids - the oldest now being 7 years old.  And she's not married.  That's not exactly the sign of a mentally stable and secure parent.  It's a free country, but I do worry about the future welfare of the now 14 children involved.|`|FA710vETaa	stay out of her business:)|`|cY8DgJv5aa	You know what?  I don't really consider it any of my business to be quite honest with you.  All I know about the situation are the few sketchy opinions/details that the media has thrown out there.  I am in no position to say if she is mentally disturbed since I haven't evaluated her.  I also do not think the doctor should be held accountable nor should he be responsible for supporting the children.  That's just asinine in my opinion.  If you hold that doctor accountable, other doctors will start running scared and there will be all kinds of lawsuits coming out of the woodwork.  Perhaps doctors who offer prenatal care to teenage mothers who can't afford it otherwise should be held accountable for also supporting that child after its born.  They helped support the pregnancy, making sure everything was healthy and normal, all so that the child could be born to a mother who wasn't even old enough to work a job to support that child.  Its a stretch of course, but so is your scenario.
cSm1zod4aa	Sounds cute to me... I wore a blue ribbon tied around my belly when everyone came over for my fiances birthday... they picked up on that real quick.lol|`|UWZSiqXWaa	Who the **** cares.|`|Yq7SlzK2aa	yA!|`|IA1irLy7aa	yea that sounds cute you could also refer to the baby as he or she, him or her, his or hers but don't say it too often just like once in a conversation they will soon pick it up.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	absolutely... thats a really cute idea.. Maybe on tuesday i would have them wear the color shirt that they think the baby is... and if they are right.....they will match you... if they are wrong, they should get the hint!!!|`|NI8D46J0aa	It is a cute idea. I like the ribbon idea also. It may make it a little more obvious what you're trying to say. Congrats on the baby.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes, it sounds cute.  Just realize that some (or most) people won't make the connection.  lol  Our first born son wore a shirt that read, "I'm a big brother" all day long and it took a long time for people to figure out what we were trying to tell them (that we were expecting again).  Sometimes people can't see the forest through the trees.    **LOVE the ribbon idea.  I'd do that one.  Its more obvious, yet more fun than just telling them.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	That sounds like a cute idea. Oh Especially if it said Baby on the front!|`|PYySLOw6aa	this is cute i love it!! i wish  i would have thought of somthing like this!!!
AA11021960	Ethnicity is what your heritage is... in your case Australian and Indian  Nationality is what country you are from or have citizenship with.  :)|`|UjI3TuSZaa	Nationality = country/countries of citizenship (ie. where he would be eligible to get a passport from)    eg. 'Australian'    Ethnic Background = his heritage, ie. countries he or you have close cultural/family ties with.    eg. 'Australian, Indian'|`|1uvLD4xhaa	Nationality is where he was born, or where he are a citizen of (eg a dual citizen of Australian and India possibly)  Your ethnicity is where YOU and YOUR PARTNER are from - eg Indian & Australian
qz41rQtwaa	after you find out she is pregnant because at that point the growth of the fetus has begun.|`|oIFMohfUaa	ANYTIME after being pregnant!  A baby is a baby.  Lost is lost.  Sad...|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Anytime you miscarry you lose a baby, and it is painful.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I think at any point. It is not like she lost a car or a shoe. She was pregnant and as such, lost a baby.  From my opinion, of course.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	when she actually losses the baby u can say that i would think 3 weeks 5 months 4 days its still the same thing she lost|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I agree with anytime.  I think after 22 or 23 weeks it is considered a stillbirth, but to me, any miscarriage is a loss of a baby.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	i believe anytime .... i lost my baby @ 7 weeks.|`|hamdnq5Yaa	Im not to sure what you are asking. If you want to tell someone that you lost a baby you just tell them. IF they are close to you there support can be helpful.
e8W9Q9cbaa	Yeh, my mum (4 kids) has non, my sister didn't get any with her first but a few on her second.     I got one tiny weeny stretch mark right at the end of the pregnancy, about half a centimetre... I was smug. But then I looked at my belly the day after the birth and was covered! No one warned me you can get them after as your skin shrinks back down so quickly! Gutted.     I used palmers cocoa butter, the stretch mark one, but not everyday. Bio oil is meant to be good, but its expensive.     I didnt think mine would ever look better, but honestly they do, my daughter is 20 months now, and they have recently shrunk and gone from angry red to silvery/brown.     Good luck!|`|dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	I did.  I got one teeny stretch mark on my lower belly and I cannot even see it anymore.  In fact, I just looked for it right now and cannot find it.  That was it.  I never got them anywhere else through my whole pregnancy either.  But I did not gain a ton of weight.  And (and they say this does not help, but whatever) I used moisturizing body wash and TONS of lotion.  I use lotion all the time anyway, so this was nothing new for me.  But I put it on all the time....otherwise my belly felt dry and itchy. I am 6 weeks with baby  2 and doing the same thing with this one.|`|atmDaT61aa	I did but it depends on your body, how elastic your skin is, and how much weight you gain. Some tips to help prevent them : keep moisturized, don't go crazy with the food (just because you're pregnant does not mean eat whatever you can find) and do pregnancy safe exercises.|`|AA10624857	I don't know statistics, but I have given birth 4 times and never got a stretch mark with any of my pregnancies.  I do believe some of it has to do with genetics since hormones play a part in the forming of stretch marks.|`|Xcyaju2vaa	Yes- it depends on genetics and how well you take care of yourself. (My mother had 7 children and no stretch marks!)|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I did!  I was so glad!  I have one teeny one on one of my boobs from pregnancy, but NONE on my belly!  I only gained 13 pounds, though.  I'm built really small (I'm 5 feet tall) so I was sure I was going to get them.  I thought I was pretty big.  I bought some of that Belly Butter but only used it a couple times, so I don't think that helped.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	some don't get it, some do. good luck...|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yes its possible, by eating healthy, gaining weight gradualy thru pregnancy, exercising, keeping urself and ur skin very hyrated, using lotions and oils ... not scratching when ur itchy is also a big one ... gooood luck.  this is my 1st pregnancy im also hoping ill be fairly lucky.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	I only know three people that didn't get stretch marks. They stayed so thin during there pregnancies that I doubt it was healthy. They also popped there babies out like it was nothing. Their family was weird anyway.|`|cSm1zod4aa	yes its possible, many people and doctors are beginning to think that its hereditary. If your mom had them, then more than likely you will too, if she didn't then you probably wont. Also, don't gain wait too fast... if you gain weight at a slow steady pace your odds of getting them are reduced.|`|Om1yADWRaa	Its is possible but unlikely if your skin is prone to stretch marks you'll get them but you can help yourself by using a good moisturizer every day to make the skin supple but remember after the birth the stretch marks with fade white and then tan can take a while but as long as you keep in good shape you'll still look beautiful.|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	I have a total of 4 kids and one one the way...No stretch marks...so yes it is possible to not get any...but than again all women are different|`|LABC73E7aa	yeah some woman dont get them. its all about your genetics. just keep your skin mosturized with some stretch mark cream that will help reduce the risk of getting them.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	it kinda isn't up to you some people get big purple ones some get red and some get white it just depends on your genetics it doesn't matter if you are skinny or big either . you can try the coco butter and stuff but if you are gonna get them you will get them sorry|`|AiUCeifEaa	yes it is possible. I am 38 weeks and still not a single stretch mark!|`|6TbXpU1iaa	yes there is luck!! you can sometimes go without stretch marx but also most woman have to apply lotion every 4 hours for the stretching to go away.|`|iIBTB5jSaa	maybe you'll get a little bit but not without any|`|UDX7yqD2aa	Every woman is different.  My mom had 3 kids & doesn't have a single stretch mark.  I've also had 3 & have a few on my lower belly.  My sister has had 1 & she got a significant amount of stretch marks. She calls it her road map.  There's no way to avoid them. I have heard that a daily rubbing of olive oil can help prevent them though.  If you do get them just consider them your battle scars and remember that they will fade over time.|`|Wjo2X9LRaa	Yup... BUT just because you dont have them while pregnant, doesnt mean you wont get them after!     I didnt have ANY! I started to lose weight, and I have LOTS!|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	I'm pregnant with my 2nd baby and havent got a single stretch mark on me!    My boss had twins before I got pregnant and suggested I use bio oil because she didn't get any stretch marks either. So I used bio-oil every single day on my bump, sides and thighs from when I was 16 weeks pregnant with both babies and it's done the trick so far!|`|6yYeCVQFaa	The best crystal ball in determining whether or not you will get stretch marks is your mother. Try not to gain weight to fast which causes worse stretch marks and moisturize your skin to help it deal with the stretching caused in pregnancy.|`|eANBUVmdaa	yes u can. i don't have one, hade 2 kids.even when i gained a lot of weight way after pregnancy i did'nt. it really depends on your skin type& water,water&water!
XCueIYnYaa	There is a chance you could get a false negative. It happens when you HGC levels weren't high enough to detect a pregnancy. It sounds like you are pregnant, if you still don't get a positive test I would go to the doctor, you may need to have a blood test, or something else could  be wrong.  Best of Luck.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	you wouldn't be feeling morning sickness by now.. it's all in your head. stop stressing.
K5TrkUhCaa	As long as they are cleaned and cooked/heated correctly then yes they are okay to eat during pregnancy.
b5JnSBstaa	I didn't really have any common indicators of labor.  I did notice extra mucus a couple weeks before. I also starting feeling like someone was pulling my pelvis bones apart. It was very painful to walk, stand, get out of bed, etc.  My dr said that its the baby settling into the pelvis that makes it hurt like that. About a week after I starting noticing these pains, I went into labor.|`|LABC73E7aa	i had those symptoms for 3 weeks and still pregnant....|`|5QSpBBaIaa	i honestly had absolutely no signs of nothing untill i was actually in labor.i never had a fake contraction or anything untill i started having the real thing.and contractions are the worst part.but if your mucus plug (you'll know what it is trust me) comes out you need to call your dr.and if your contractions are evenly spaced even if there 6-7 min apart call the dr too.good luck and congrats!|`|bulv8t3qaa	I have been researching the 'net for days trying to figure out if some of the things I am experiencing are "signs" of labor -- I know all about the common ones (plug, diarrhea, achy back, nesting and so on) but I am more curious about if anyone felt anything else - for example, the past day my belly has turned into an absolute rock all over the place... and it doesn't come and go like a BH or false labor, just stays hard all the time.  Baby movements have somewhat decreased, have that "butterfly" feeling in my stomach, can't concentrate on anything... or is it all just wishful thinking? guess what I am really asking is things you experience other then the "common" signs - for example, my grandma SWEARS that the night before you go into labor, you will have the best night's sleep!! any others out there??|`|qmmu6hv5aa	im 37 weeks and have been feeling what your describing for about 2 weeks now, i told the doctor and she said that still doesn't say when i will deliver, i said "am i really going to make it to my due date with all of this going on?" and she told me that she doesn't predict anymore because people can go on like that for weeks...|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Honey I wish it was a sign.  I've had all of that for about a week and a half now.  I have contractions, cramping, not much diarrhea, just had it once, and I have had more discharge, but NOTHING.   But then my mother said before she went into labor with me she felt like she was coming down with the stomach flu (diarrhea, nausea, achey body) and had me the next day so who knows.      Edit: if you are losing your mucous plug, have already lost it, or have not seen it yet, then you do NOT need to call the doctor.  You can if you really want to, but it's not necessary.  Losing the mucous plug is no indication of labor being near at all.  Some women lose it months/weeks before delivery.  There is no need to call the doctor when you lose your mucous plug, all they will tell you is to wait for contractions to become 5-7 minutes apart or for your water to break.
AA10948113	i went and with my first, they gave me NO restrictions and i passed. this time, i had no food after midnight. i could drink water though. i don't know my results yet, i go in 2wks to the dr. i am 29wks , i think, lol. its either 28 or 29. lol.     they say that it doesn't affect the baby, but next time,without telling them just eat a saltine cracker or low sugar ..low protein. it could be that you are hypoglycemic-which means your blood sugar drops if you don't eat often. try making the appt. early, 7am. stay up till midnight the night before, thats what i did, and by the time i got the test done and over, i was a little queasy but ready for food! keep crackers and chees in your vehicle, so as soon as you are done, you can snack till you get food.     also, if your prenatals make you sick, take flintstones 2, a day. i do that. its lot better and hasn't made me sick at all. i have a 6yr old as well, so we take them together.|`|b5JnSBstaa	I would ask them again to be clear on their instructions.  I also had to take 2 glucose blood tests while I was pregnant. The first test I drank an orange glucose drink and has to wait in the waiting room for an hour, then they did the blood. That test came back slightly elevated. Before that test I didn't have to fast(not eat or drink).  I just couldn't eat anything really high in sugar or carbs.  The second test was horrible!!!  I couldn't eat anything after midnight, the night before.  I drank a stronger concentrate of glucose and had to have my blood drawn 3 times during a 3 hr waiting period.  After that I was free to eat and drink. They said that a lot of women feel very sick to their stomachs b/c of the high sugar content, but I don't see why they would ban you from eating after the test. .   That sounds strange to me. Definately ask them again b/c I think there might have been a misunderstanding.  After the test is done, you can eat, just don't eat something super sugary or full of carbs.  That much sugar can make you sick.|`|GCcQPzD6aa	This is a glucose tolerance test (gtt), It is important to have this because you need to be closely monitored if you do have gestational diabetes. I had 3 of these tests during and after my pregnancy. At each of them I had to not eat or drink anything except water from 10pm then the following morning had to be at hospital at 8.30am to have bloods taken and be given a glucose drink. Then I had to wait in waiting room for 3hours again not eating or drinking anything except water before having further bloods taken. The reason for staying in waiting room is so if there was a problem with me fainting the dr's could help. My gtt test showed I did have gestational diabetes so I then had to be monitored at the hospital every week, aswell as taking insulin every day. I had to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day using a finger prick test, and inject insulin into my tummy with every meal. I then had to go to the hospital weekly to have my blood pressure, weight and blood sugar level monitored. They also scanned me every week to check babies heart rate and size. As long as it is kept under control and monitored your baby can be born perfectly healthy as was mine. The only thing with my baby was that she was slightly big from the extra sugar levels in my body, but apart from that she was perfect. As for parental vitamins, you can take them once the second lot of blood has been taken, you can eat then too. In fact they advise you to eat after it is finished as your baby will need the food.|`|1KppBoKnaa	i dont remember not being able to eat or drink anything for that long. I think i was just not allowed to eat for the hour after i drank the stuff until they drew blood.    my levels turned out fine not fasting before hand.|`|AA10624857	This is perfectly fine.  Typically with the 1 hour glucose tolerance test you don't have to fast, but you do with the 3 hour test.  After the test is finished, though, you can eat and drink normally.  You shouldn't have to go the whole day with out eating or drinking just until after they take the final blood draw.  If something happens, such as you are ill and end up not eating for a day or two it isn't going to adversely affect your baby.  If you are healthy you will have plenty of nutrients in your blood system for your baby to use.  You won't be able to take your prenatal vitamin before the test, but there isn't any reason you can't take it after the test is over.  It is common for pregnant women to have elevated blood glucose numbers during the 1 hour test yet go on to have results in the normal range for the 3 hour test.  Even if you do end up with a diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes, it is not that bad.  I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th pregnancy.  I was given a diet to follow and I had to monitor my blood glucose numbers 4 times a day.  I was able to manage my numbers quite well and didn't require insulin, but some women do.  One of the risks with Gestational Diabetes is to have a larger than average birth weight baby.  However, this doesn't happen all the time.  My baby was born at 41 weeks and weighed 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Most cases of Gestational Diabetes are gone as soon as the baby is born, most specifically when the placenta is delivered.  Speak with your doctor about the next test you have done.  Ask to have it done as soon as possible in the morning than take along a healthy snack to eat right after it is done.  It is not uncommon to not feel so well after drinking the glucose solution.  I know I didn't feel so good for a few days after wards.  ADDED:  I had Gestational Diabetes plus now I have Glucose Intolerance.  Women who have had GD have an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, so my blood glucose has been monitored for a number of years.  Fasting before the test is normal, but there is no reason to have to continue fasting after the test is finished.  I have never heard of such a thing for any blood test.  Ask your doctor for clarification and if he/she says not to eat for 24 hours, I would seek out a second opinion as that seems wrong.  For the 1 hour glucose tolerance test, fasting is not necessary nor is it recommended.  Fasting for the 3 hour glucose tolerance test is normal.  Absolutely do not eat something without telling them when the test instructions say fast after midnight.  Anything, even a saltine, is going to affect the accuracy of the test results.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	No it's not wrong.  That is what they require for accurate results for the test.  ALL of us pregnant women go through it.  they usually schedule the appointment in the morning, but if they dont have an opening till later in the day then you need to make do with what they can schedule.   Your  baby will not be effected one bit.  Your stomach may growl quite a bit, but baby already gets everything from you first no matter if you eat first thing in the morning or not.  Your body is still containing nutrients even when you skip a meal or two. Why can't you take your prenatals after the appointment?|`|giKCTfnfaa	nope.  i had to do the same thing.  i thought i was going to die before i got that test over with!  that sugary stuff just seemed to bounce on an empty stomach.  then the lab messed something up and i had to do it again.  yay fun.    **added**  i could take my vitamins after the tests only after i had a full meal.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	No, it sounds completely normal.  It's a Glucose Tolerance Test, and everything you described is completely normal.    Your baby is not affected by this.  The baby takes what it needs from your body; even though you may not have eaten for more than 12 hours, you're still storing enough calories and nutrients to survive for a good long while.  The baby will feed on that, leaving whatever is left for you.    Edit: For this next test, try to schedule it early in the morning  Also, since they're having you retake it, they may make you have the 3 hour test.  During that test, you go in and have your blood drawn, and then you drink the glucose drink; then you have your blood drawn three more times, once for each hour.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	I chose to skip the glucose test during my last pregnancy. The circumstances of the test are, IMO, unhealthy, and do not give an accurate picture as to whether or not someone has Gestational Diabetes. Instead, I chose to have my midwife monitor me at each of my appointments, and monitored myself at home by watching for warning signs.    Just because something is "usually done" doesn't mean it's the best idea. I think the glucose test is safe enough, and that there's nothing wrong with having it done, but I also think that women should realize they can refuse it as well. I would rather have my midwife and myself watch me carefully, rather than deprive myself and the baby of nourishment for hours, only to mass-inject us with sugar on an empty stomach.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Just eat a big dinner the night before 8 pm.  The get up early in the morning and be the first one there for the blood test.  It is safe for baby and it's safer that you do it the right way so they will be able to tell if you have gestational diabetes.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	That's totally normal for those tests except usually they schedule them in the morning so you don't have to go all day without eating.    After the test is done and they have taken your last blood draw you can eat.|`|QVFeqpVvaa	its what needs to be done to make sure you arent suffering from gestational diabetes. i drank the glucose drink and had 1 blood test that came out high.  i then had to fast, drink another glucose drink and they gave me a blood test every hour for three hours.  by the time the test was finished i was so weak, tired, hungry.  the dr said that is perfectly normal.  i went and got something to drink and eat right after the testing was finished.  my test came out good.  dont worry about skipping a meal it is important for the baby, good luck!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I don't know why they asked you to fast...that is usually for the 3 hour test.    My doctor specifically told me to go ahead and eat breakfast before I came in for the drink (at about 9am.)  She just said no fruit or juices.    *I don't understand the TD.  You indicated you went in for the glucose screening (as opposed to the 3 hour test,) and I have found no information that indicates you need to fast.  As a matter of fact, this website says you SHOULD eat a couple of hours prior to the test to avoid becoming ill.  Perhaps you can ask another doctor there for a second opinion?  http://www.babycenter.com/0_glucose-scre...|`|v9rzGYWoaa	That the way it was for me. I got there 8 am drank the nasty stuff and sat for i think three hours the first time. the second time is five hours. It sucks but it doesn't hurt you or the baby. Just makes you feel like ****.|`|1G97OBNEaa	When I took the test (a few weeks ago) i didn't have to do anything special like fasting.  I was told to eat and drink as normal but when I drank the drink I had to wait one hour and I wasn't allowed to eat, drink or chew gum for that hour.  Mine must have been a different test or something.  I would def. schedule the test as early in the morning as possible...I know I get sick and shaky when I don't eat for a while so I can imagine how you felt.  Good luck with the new test and congrats on your baby.........
AA11021960	I had three boys.  My third pregnancy I broke out with acne.  I had to really watch my chocolate and sugar intake.

fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	if he looks like he is really having a hard time i would give him some infant mylicon drops they are completely safe with no side effects it helps...and think about switching formula your newborn may be having a hard time digesting it|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if he's not constipated there is nothing to worry about; if you see really hard, dry, or pellet like stools or excessive straining, then u have something to worry about.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Does he seem distressed?  Is he having enough pee diapers during the day?  Is he eating?  Is he otherwise healthy?  If he's not unhappy and the pediatrician says he's fine, he's probably fine.  5 days is a little on the long side for a formula-fed baby to go without pooping though, so he might be a bit constipated.  If he's especially cranky, that's probably it.    Try putting the tip of his rectal thermometer into his anus, just a tiny little bit, not very far.  Sometimes this stimulates their reflex to poop.|`|C6d4ndMOaa	I don't think you'll find a pediatrician here; I would go with what he/she said. Remember that you're feeding your baby liquid with nutrients and since it's not solid, there is not much solid to dispose of (poop). If you don't like what the pediatrician says, get another opinion.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	wow, i would get a second opinion.  my pediatrician says if they dont go once atleast every 3 days then its a cause for concern.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Your pediatrician is right, do NOT give karo syrup, sugar water, juice or anything.  It IS normal for newborns to not have regular BMs.  Some newborns can go up to a week and a half without having a BM (mostly breastfed babies, but it is not uncommon for formula babies to go that long without a bm).  Those of you saying "I don't think it's normal" need to do some research.  I was worried when my son didn't go for a few days, so I called the doctor, he said he was fine, then I googled and researched it and everything said it was normal and fine.  Now if your son starts struggling when he goes (grunting, screaming, crying), has poop that is small and hard, then you need to call the pediatrician about constipation and then consider the karo syrup. Give it a couple more days and I bet he will have a BM.  If he doesn't appear to be uncomfortable then do not worry, he is fine.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	try not to worry as hard as that is, bc worrying will only make all things worse. You can be cocnerned, but worrying takes so much energy. I only have one baby, but when she was 12 days old, ehr bm's did slow down a lot but she was still going about 4 times a day. But she was mostly breastfed, which in babeis that young, has a laxative effect on them for some reason. Formula-fed babeis when theyre newborn do tend to get constipated more so. However, was his last bm hard, or soft? Does he appear to be in any pain or discomfort/ gassy? fussy? if not, and if his last bm was soft and "mushy" then it could just be normal for him. However I wouldnt let him go too much longer without one. and if you feel your pediatrician sint concerned enough, you can always switch.   here are some home remedies that you can do to get him to go:  --put a rectal thermometer up his butt and then take it out, that should help him go  ---or put a q-tip with baby vaseline on the tip, and put it up there, then take it out. that could also help.  ---or you can give him 1 OUNCE 9no more!) per day of dark karo syrup avaialable at any grocery store in the baking section usually. put it in his bottle with the formula or by itself. he may spit some of it out bc hes not used to the taste, and i dotn blame him, but as long as takes some it should be o.k.    try ONE of these methods for 2 days, if nothing still, move onto the next method, etc. Then if still nothing of trying all these methods afetr a few days, then it's time to DEMAND your pediatrician see him.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	put two drops of dark corn syrup in a bottle with once ounce of formula that will do the trick|`|uCdpqmSqaa	He's just a little anal retentive.  He'll grow up and be a politician.|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i think you may want to look for a new pediatrician, thats not normal...or at least i wouldnt think so|`|hrMhhB4Saa	no he's fine. my son went 6 days without pooping at that age. you can try taking a thermoment putting a little vaseline on it and puting it in the rectum and making a circular motion, if he has to poop that will stimulate him|`|qN5iVvAFaa	If he hasn't pooped in another 3 days i would take him in... not just the pediatrician you saw before, but a different one...|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	your babys still a newborn baby he's not digesting anything but liquids so he won't be producing anything for a BM as much as someone whose eating solids  go with what your peditrician said and wait a few more days after about 3-4 more days and he still hasn't and your still worried go to the same or a different peditrician if your babys acting normal then i dont worry to much about it|`|NCSKeRXTaa	he should be breast fed it is a lot better for the baby|`|IUy3IQAFaa	so he doesnt have to poop whats the big deal?|`|CfD1bRNtaa	He/she should be fine if the doctor says he's fine. I've heard of things like this, and everything has worked out fine in the end.|`|35AfY6gTaa	If the pediatrician says he's fine, he's fine.  Wait a few days, and if he's still hasn't, take him back.  It's okay.  Just calm down.|`|DYm8rPpyaa	Hell poop eventually i would relax and wait plus dont use google if the doc said ok then it should be fine. get a second opnion isf it makes you feel better|`|ji8PuePIaa	in the beggining babies dont poop barely at all because all you are feeding them is formula liquid, so they bassically just urinate the whole time. It is completely normal and your baby is fine. :)|`|7FvVx3kVaa	i would get a second opinion. I don't think that is fine. My daughter was 10 days old and didnt poop for 3 days and the doctors and milwaukee childrens hospital were real worried! she had to get surgery cause she was so plugged up. I would deff get a second opionon on that! Formula will tend to make a baby constipated but not that long. the longest should be a day or two! I hope everything goes okay! You can also by a laxative they do work also|`|tkhBJMmhaa	That sounds odd to me I have four children and I can't ever remember them going that long. I do know that when my oldest was a newborn he had a little problem and they told me to give him a tsp. of karo corn syrup to help him out. The way I see it doctors can be wrong and it's your child so if in doubt take him somewhere else.|`|ekr7IlX7aa	That's a long time! No wonder you're worried.  I would do the dark corn syrup that was suggested earlier.  Just because your baby probably has a belly ache.   I assume that the baby's not crying any more than normal if the Dr. doesn't think it's a problem?  If you're still not feeling comfortable, consult a different pediatrician.  Good luck!
fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	i agree if you are going to be worried and calling home every hour dont go it really will ruin it... then again a little break from baby is completly healthy|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, myself, i couldn't leave my seven mo old overnight, so i def couldn't do that; if u can and enjoy yourself, go ahead....|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i wouldn't leave my 3 month old baby- my son is almost 22 months and i plan on taking my son lol|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	You can delay the honeymoon until you feel comfortable.

AA11021960	Hi!!!  I really think that what your child looks like is a toss of the genetic dice.    I am full blooded Irish and have red hair, The majority of my family does.... not all.  My hubby is Scandanavian and German, he has dark brown hair.  We have one blonde boy, one dark brown haired, and my 7 month old is flaming red haired!  My mother in laws family is full German.  There are six kids.  The two oldest are red heads, the two middle are blondes and the two youngest are brunettes.  Oddly, both of the parents were brunettes as well, lol.     Now eyes are a lil different for some reason.  Generally if you both have the same color eyes, that will be what your children have.  At least from all my observations.   So... you will just have to wait and see!!!  :)|`|Bw18seFqaa	red hair can be a dominant or a recessive gene..  since so many in your family have red hair, it sounds like it may be a dominant gene..    depends on what genes you BF carries..  and if the gene for the red hair is dominant over his genes.|`|3TT2ErHZaa	It depends on the red hair allele, whether it is dominant or recessive. If it is dominant over balck, then yes. If it is recessive, it may or may not be. It depends on your boyfriends genes and whether he has any ancestors that had red hair. I reccommend a gentic counselor. Sorry if that doesn't really help.|`|w2GG8Z99aa	My sis-in-law and *EVERY* member of her family: both parents, all 9 of her siblings, her paternal grandfather and her maternal grandmother all have/had red hair and she and her husband (dark brown hair!) had one blonde son and one dark-brown haired daughter... not a spot of red to be seen! It is all up for grabs when you get down to it!|`|FA710vETaa	they have a good chance|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is a very good posibility that your child/children will have red hair.
44OH7Si6aa	Honestly the only pants I can wear are my pre-prego pants unbuttoned with the bella band over them. With my full panel pants, they start to sag down, i can't keep them up on my hip area and i end up tugging them back up all day long. My cute maternity pants with the "real waist" are worse, the part that is supposed to stretch around my tummy folds itself down sometimes and sometimes shows a bit of the bottom of my belly. but i love the bella band and highly recommend getting at least one|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Men's sweats. I roll them up once so they are under my belly. Just the $5 ones at walmart are just fine. Umm, do not get the ones with the 2 inch band that are supposed to go under your belly. That doesn't work because the outer layer shrinks and the inner elastic doesn't it gets bunched up and uncomfortable so I ended up cutting mine down- now they fall off. the best ones are the ones that go up to your bra actually. You wouldn't think so, but the material is thin and gives you some belly support in the later months.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Hubby's sweats! LOL But really, just try them all on and see what works best for you. What one person finds comfy, you may find restrictive! Good luck!|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I have the normal waisted maternity pants from Motherhood and also 2 pairs of the ones with the stretchy top, not the panel, just the roll down piece.  I've only worn each 2 times with this pregnancy and I'm at 37 weeks.  They both worked great though and didn't fall down.  I would go to the store and try a few different pairs on and walk around in them to see which ones will be best for you.|`|hamdnq5Yaa	I liked the full panel. Now they have a new kind slimming panel or something like that.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I loved the ones with the wide elastic waistband that sits below the belly- I still have one pair of Gap jeans (that I got on sale) that I wear with long shirts from time to time because they are SO comfy!  I hated the roll down and full panel ones.  I didn't like to have my belly covered.|`|QVFeqpVvaa	motherhood maternity pants are the best!  i like the full panel vs the half panel.  i like the support the full panel gives.  ive tried maternity pants everywhere, motherhood maternity is the best!  they have a lot of plus size choices too!|`|dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	I LOVE the ones with the band that sit below the belly.  I could start wearing them right away when the early pregnancy bloat kicks in (that is how I knew I was pregnant...my pants did not button, but I had not gained any other weight).  They are super comfy.  The more pregnant I get, the lower the pants sit.  Then after I am pregnant, they still fit super comfortable until my belly goes back down enough to get into real pants again.  I literally wear these pants all 9 months.  I got mine at the Gap and Motherhood.
dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	You can try.  Generally it take a day or two after implantation (which would have caused the light bleeding) for enough hormone to build up to make it to the urine.  So at this point, you may get a positive.  Or you could test negative and still be pregnant.  If this happens, then test again the day your period is late.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	it wont do any harm to take a early test now sometimes they work , with one pregnany i got a positive 4 days early and the other i didnt get a positive until 3 days late, just remember that they are not as accuarate until after your period is due.  If it comes back negative now, wait until after your period is late and try again.  If you are pregnant the spotting you had was implantation bleeding.|`|70kh6VSoaa	its way to early to be having symptoms to begin with. yes it might be to early try not thinking about it for a few days cause stressing about it will make you miss you . or be late just wait and see if you miss then take a test first thing in the morning....
3EhoJ42zaa	check your weigh, urine, blood pressure,dependiong how far you are, they may measure your belly or check for the heartbeat with a doppler (normally after 15 weeks sometimes earlier) ask if everything is going okay and thats it.  All your appointments will be that way until the end|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i just had my second mid-wife appointment and all they did was take my blood pressure,measured my stomach and tryed to find the babys heartbeat on a doppler. and that was it.
819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	If you havent gotten your pap smear done this year or an hiv test they will definatley do that they will do a vaginal exam and then you will just have to keep going so they can check your weight and they do ultrasounds about 3 or 4 out of like 15 visits you have with the doctor so not alot you should just expect the nurse to check the heartbeat of the baby and check your weight and ask you questions     GOOD LUCK  :)|`|iwYu32N2aa	at my ob they dont i have to go somewhere else to get u/s done. But they dont give you an ultrasound every time you go to the ob|`|5SHPRfUgaa	I had sonograms done at my OBGYN's office but whenever there was something that they thought was wrong [twice during this pregnancy] they sent me to the hospital to have a ultrasound done.|`|Qn5mn99vaa	You generally won't get an u/s at your OB's office. You should only have one more u/s done at 20 weeks or so, and that will probably be at a radiologist or perinatologist's office. My OB had an u/s machine at her office, she used every visit for me, but that was because it was twins and easier to hear/see both heartbeats. I also had u/s at a perinatologist's office regularly.   As far as second visit, I don't think you'll get an exam. If I remember correctly, you get one at your first visit and then you get them every visit in your last month. Good luck!
l4mMBe5Aaa	My daughter (11 months) will pull a hat right off UNLESS we show her what she looks like in the mirror with the hat on.  She loves to look at herself in the mirror (vain little thing!), and will leave a hat on if she thinks she looks cute in it (our "oohs and ahhs" help, too!).  She's bald (still!), so she wears a hat all the time in the winter.  We have a few that fasten under the chin for when it's really cold out so that she can't pull them off if tempted.|`|AA11085356	I never really put him in hats, but when I do it doesn't seem to bother him. Guess your daughter doesn't want to hide her hair!|`|5IlaGPxUaa	No he isnt too bad... pulls them off if it goes near his eyes but apart from that leaves it on...|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	Yes. I have resorted to only buy hats that have can tie up under her chin.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yep, my son hates hats, I gave up on them.    (We tried one that ties underneath but he pulls at it constantly and now he is getting strong so that didn't work either)|`|YbnMcP9yaa	My daughter will put wear it to the mirror or if we put it on and leave the house, but it doesn't last 5 minutes. She is 1 year 4 months.|`|tnKhIUK1aa	Kids at that age imitate their parents...Do you wear hats??  Play with hats.  Have a play session in which you try on all sorts of hats and put a set of hats before the child and see which one they put on as they mimic your behavior.  Go shopping and put a bunch of hats out before her.  Try the ones you like on and show her and make it special and then let her try some on and pick the ones that she seems to like...|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son use to hate wearing hats- now he has this one hat that he hardly wants to take off- he's almost 22 months|`|fHjSonssaa	My little boy goes both ways.  When he's in an exploring mood, he'll yank them off and then laugh.  When he's bundled up, tired, or already really interested in something else and I slip hat on- he doesn't notice (so least he'll wear it until he gets bored with whatever he was originally interested in, THEN he;ll yank the hat off)    Only time I really care if he has one on (even though I LOVE the cute ones we have that match his outfits)- is when we go out in the cold- and he doesn't fight it then (because he doesn't have usable hands)- otherwise, I'm starting to learn that all those impratical cute accesories us moms just HAVE to have are better left at the store- and funds saved for a rainy day.  (doesn't mean I still don't indulge here and there)        It's sort of the same with his toys- I bought the really cute ball machine and all he wants to play with is one of his plastic hangers.  Who knew??!!|`|w4zjmhxoaa	For a while this year -- I would say between the ages of 11 and 17 months, my son would do the same.  Now he's 19 months old, it's so cold outside, he's got to wear a hat!  I tell him it's not a choice, and he's been leaving it on.    It's one of those lovely phases!
b7018d9c9ec16027422751e58ba74476aa	I was just like you. I had a miscarriage so that made things worse with my second pregnancy. Just chill out. Its better for you and the baby. Even if you by chance start spotting its totally normal. I spotted with my daughter in the first and the third trimester and everything was totally fine. Just relax things will be so much easier for you if you are calm.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i was like his at first but the fear faded for the most part- of course you will worry a little through it all in the back of your mind- but learn to enjoy your time being pregnant and not worry about everything. plus after 3 months when the risk for miscarriage go down a lot you'll feel much better|`|IFqY2w1Paa	I was exactly like you when I was in the first trimester. The moment I hit 12 weeks, I was extremely relieved. The chances of having a miscarriage are lower than the chances of carrying a healthy baby. =) I kept worrying and worrying about miscarriage, then having him too early...but he's perfectly healthy and worrying does me no good. Don't worry, you are just fine! Did you know that a heartbeat found in the ultrasound lowers the risk of miscarriage to less than 4%? My doctor told me that at my first prenatal appointment, and I was 6 weeks pregnant at that point. Why shouldn't you enjoy your pregnancy the best you can? You're healthy and the baby is, too! Good luck and congrats. |`|eemmWU0Haa	Its called a nervous pregnancy not good...maybe you should just relax and have fun...and just be glad your pregnant and stop stressing it ain't good!
Ksbf5OUQaa	I've got to admit this sends me wild!!! My daughter went through similar at school, and they will close ranks and deny its happening. Next time she does this tell her that you know she is singling your daughter out for whatever reason and bullying and picking at her constantly, it is upsetting your daughter and yourself, family, tell her if it doesn't stop as from now, you will be reporting this to the Chairman of the Board of Governors!!!  Please do this if it doesn't stop, as the governors will not ignore a strongly written letter of complaint about a teacher. You must, if you aren't already, keep a record of all that has happened so that they can see whats been going on. Good luck!!!|`|bufQfEqbaa	I would call a conference, have the principal sit in and tell the teacher how you feel, maybe things will come up that you didn't know about.  I would start there, if it gets worse and your daughter can't handle it, pull her out of the school if you have to.  Just make sure you get all the sides of the story first.|`|c9ZqOAk4aa	Definitely talk to the principal or administrator! Your daughter's sanity is worth it!|`|HxZyPXS0aa	call and email the principal and vice principal! it will work, you have to make your voice heard in the office.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Go to the headmaster of the school and tell him or her your concerns. If they don't do anything about it then take it to a higher level - everybody has to answer to somebody. I was also bullied by a teacher when I was little so I can completely understand how awful your daughter must be feeling, it could damage her self-esteem enormously.     Get your daughter to keep a diary and note down everything the teacher says that feels wrong or makes her upset. This will all be good evidence if you are ever asked to provide some. Click on the link below for some advice. Good luck!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Talk to the head teacher|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	report her to your local education authority or like us pull her out of school and go for home tuition you are given all the guides on what needs to be taught by you|`|EgLTmiTjaa	go tlk 2 the teacher and tell her ur concerns face to face|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	Talk to the principal and ask what the options are.  Does another teacher teach the class and could you move her to the other teacher? You might consider doing home schooling to finish up this year.  You need to get yourself and your child out of the situation.
XXZFf1AYaa	You need to take charge, and remember that the child is 6 not you. No matter what he says or does, no matter how forceful or violent he could even imagine being, you're the boss. You don't have to scream and be violent yourself to show him this, if anything he knows how to pull your strings if you do. But be firm, and don't give in. Get what you ask for, if he/she doesn't do it willingly everything should be taken away and they have to sit alone facing a wall until they decide to agree to listen and behave. When they are doing what they are supposed to, praise him/her so they know it's what they should be doing, and they feel better behaving appropriately than misbehaving. Please remember though you're dealing with a 6 year old and even though they can drive you crazy and get under your skin, please don't hold a grudge. Kids pick up on that and come to believe they are unlikeable and continue to act bad even with rewards for being good.|`|HZbSbZIraa	unlike a lot of the answers i think that hitting a child with anger issues is only going to manifest those problems even more !!!! i have my degree in education and what i find works best for this tough age group is positive reinforcement !!!! for example take something he really loves be it playing outside computer time etc whatever he really loves and use that to your atvantage. Take two small jars one that says the thing he really loves for example comptuer time and the other jar that says naughty behavior or no computer time anytime he is a good boy and does as he is told he can earn a stone or marble towards time for that thing he loves HOWEVER any time he is bad or shouts nasty things you take TWO stones or marbles away and he has to earn them back and he CAN NOT have his favorite thing until the jar is filled with stones or marbles. If you have to take more than 4 stones away give him a 6 minute time out (1 minute for every year old) if he coporates during his time out he can earn a marble or stone. Kids really respond well to a behvior plan that is surrounded by positive reinforcement !!! By encouragin the good behavior by rewarding it you are creating a better mind set and attitude for your child to have. Another great thing is to use a green yellow red system like a stop light you start on green and for every time you do a bad behavior you get moved the first time you move to yellow its just a warning and when you have a bad behavior again you move to red resulting in some sort of punishment ie time out or take a toy away etc. I use this in my classroom and it works wonders !!!!!|`|yfcJwQr8aa	That super nanny crap is for the birds...your the parent.  They had to have someone else come in their house and do their job.  Take everything and i do mean everything from them...every single toy, thier tv out their room and all.  Everytime they talk back make them put a plain bar of  soap in their mouth. .yeah its old school but it works and not its not dangerous.  they will think twice about mouthing off to you.  the child is 6 if you dont get them under control now then when they are a teenage you will have no hope.  Dont be afraid to discipline your child.  I have a 5 year old and you can believe she says No ma'am and Yes Ma'am to me.  She knows better to be disrewspectful.    Just as she is GOD-FEARING...She is also MOM-Fearing.    Meaing 'she has respect', 'reverence', 'piety', 'awe toward a supreme power'...That may be over the top to some of you but thats a childs place!!!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	With a good smack on the backside.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Watch super nanny, she doesn't hit or shout and every single time it works, and those children are probably worse than yours. Hitting them is only going to make them angrier, that's how  99% of serial killers started off.    If hitting worked so great then why is your answer to everything violence? And why do only have negative things to say about the government, and mouth off to the police.|`|bufQfEqbaa	6 years old is a harder age to try and stop that behavior.  I would check their background, why does he or she have anger, why does he or she argue,are they insecure, have disease or illness that would make them this way.  Do they have consistency, structure, love, devotion from parents?  I would take them to a counselor for help or use tough love!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	well if that was my kid id slap him. my kids DO NOT disrespect me or anyone. that is just not smacking some butt when they were 2 and mouthing off. for real if that was my kid he would not see the light of day. so blame the parents for their kid being an a - hole. good for you parents for raising ungrateful little bastard. i hope you are proud|`|rTTwH9Unaa	This is why i think you should be able to smack your kids. Can you? I don't even know anymore, but the naughty step is for gays, bring back the cane.|`|Of08XyvSaa	Who is in charge ? you or the kid ? Hit him and that will solve all your problems. Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.|`|WLynh3bCaa	Don't give into her, be consistent. You must be strong and endure her tantrums and her attitude (unfortunately). I honestly think that a decent spanking will get her attention- I say 'decent' because she's six years old- so it needs to be hard enough to get her attention. Just don't leave marks, spank her on her clothing and not more than 5 swats.|`|mrrVtKGgaa	TIMEOUT!!|`|9EgXeA2waa	I hope you dont think im being sillt but watch super nanny ITV 2 :)    ALOT OF HELP THERE SERIOUSLY|`|2dke6ChJaa	hit him, thats the problem with kids nowadays, i was hit as a kid and i turned out ok.|`|iN0cyZoTaa	Sometimes I think issues like anger, not listening, and saying nasty things can be manifestations of bigger problems going on with children.  Granted, sometimes a time out or a spanking are just what is needed, but occasionally the problems are deeper than what at first appears. If the problems persist with a 6 year old then sometimes I think it's appropriate to seek professional counseling to see if something else is going on.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Slap her bum. She is old enough. Don't BEAT the girl but a good slap on the behind (not bare) should stop it. then stand her facing the corner of two walls until she calms down. hold her there if necessary|`|prqrQcd1aa	Put her  in the corner every time he does it for 6 minutes. Do it every time she does it consistently. Tell her that she is not to do it anymore and if she does she goes to the corner for it. IF she does it again after you have told her then start corner time... if she gets out of the corner, then put her back in, as many times as it takes, telling her only once that her time starts when she is standing there quietly. When putting her back in the corner(if you have this problem) do not talk to her after the first time of telling her when time starts, and do not look at her... she will eventually get the point and stop!|`|qbzt3r4xaa	Easy.. Just work his mind into something he accepts.. to like.  Be progressive.. with genuine love. Remember kids can see (right) through you. Easy listening basically x|`|fDXrRtkHaa	If you're not against it, a few swats on the bottom never hurt anyone. If you are COMPLETELY against that, you could always try whatever else you "non-spankers" do...|`|cMpYz5B4aa	start watching supernanny! it sounds cheesy, but that woman is amazing with unruly little kids and i swear she has an answer for anything. she also has books too- buy one asap.|`|ErtxmW4Xaa	supernanny lol or a naughty chair or summin usually helps :)
Nnqw6AU3aa	He might be a little irritated or ticked off that  you'd want to do that.    Then again it's your dance and you make it  up, so it's more up to you than it is him. Just  tell him in a nice way or ask him nicely.
rFtKFp03aa	They probably will be.. some kids are lucky when they eat crap when they are younger they burn it fast...     I would imagine as they become teenagers and adults they would grow into overweight adults because of their poor eating habits..|`|7SKVCPcSaa	yep, they probably will be!    their parents aren't doing anything to teach them good eating habits. i mean, my son gets some junk food but not much at all! he has had one cookie today.. a few chips. three sweet tarts and the sweet tarts were rewards for peeing in the potty!    the chips were just with his lunch. and his cookie was a before bedtime treat!    they will most likely be over weight if someone doesn't get their eating habits under control.
eCZ6YW4Paa	Begin with how a girl appears and feels completely before puberty and go from there.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	oh my lol. dont make a book!. just tell her!! lol|`|gILygKvRaa	Dear Melanie- As you get older your body will expierence changes. go on to list these then put the dates she did and stuff like that|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Well, if you want it to have a story line it can be about a young girl who unexpectedly gets her period and doesn't know what it is, so she goes to her mom [or older sister, or both] for advice.   You can answer any questions she might have as well as making a story at the same time.  How thoughtful.|`|X1NVjZEKaa	lol|`|AA12305061	look on gURL.com              ^^  I survived on it through those "tweener" years!|`|okp0CMc3aa	omg sorry, but this sounds like it would embarrass the sh*t out of the poor girl, especially if you get your friends involved, buy her a book instead or get one from the library!!!
d67ULZQ6aa	Well just because It's over now that doens't mean that yall will never get back together. If he was making eye contact with you then that means it isn't totally over. Just talk to him or give it time.|`|ZtuLKde8aa	First, you're a kid. Love right now for you isn't real- it's hormones. Control them, and you'll be fine.    Second, it's just a guy. Who cares? There are billions more out there.|`|f65f6a3828a7dfca1810ccf182dbfd3baa	Of course it's hard to see someone whom you have ended a relationship with.It brings back all the sweet memories you had together so i think if u wanna get over him ry not to see him it helps trust me..It's fairly easy when you are occupied with somthing to do like hanging out with friends and all.|`|w69QiAqOaa	my goodness. thats how it happens. first you're all sad, but eventually youll get all "hes so stupid" and be all angry, then youll get over him!
wiAVa1H5aa	You can have lunch meat/deli meats IF they are fully cooked before consumption.   There is a good chance that uncooked meats could have listeria in them, which for a normal person with a fully active immune system that would be fine, they'd just get ill but in a pregnant woman it can infect the uterus and kill the fetus.   So, go for the pastrami - but cook it first, sometimes cooked pastrami with some cheese on top is great with a toasted bun.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	It is just because of the high nitrates and sodium in the processed meats.  Try healthier versions and low sodium.  Talk to your doctor or a dietitian if you have concerns.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	It's okay to eat as long as you heat it up til its steaming hot. :)  That kills any bad bacteria.|`|AA11027121	If you heat the meat up then it is fine.  The problem is that the meat might have a toxin on it that could make the baby sick and it needs to be heated to kill the toxin off.  It can get this from the equipment that is used to cut it and other areas.  So if you make a nice hot sandwich then it should fine.|`|yVAdjc6caa	My doctor told me I could have lunch meat from a deli (like at Walmart where they slice it for you.)
avx7bLnKaa	my newborn son is like that too and similar circumstances with co-sleeping etc...    with my first son I didn't start moving him around to playpen or crib until 5 months...once he could roll over and tummy sleep I didn't have much problem laying the sleeping baby on his tummy in the crib or playpen    you can try laying down to nurse bby and when baby has slept for 10-15 minutes you can try to slide away from him and get up...|`|5JB1fHz9aa	My son had the same problem... he slept 6 hours straight by the time he was 2 weeks old and slept completely through the night by the time he was 2 months old.  He was a horrible napper though!  He would fall asleep while breastfeeding and I did everything I could to keep him awake, but it just didn't work.  I would lay him down and than 15-20 mins later he would wake up.  Sometimes I would just hold him so I could get some quiet time and he would sleep longer.  I honestly don't know how and when he started taking better naps, but it did eventually get better.  Also I had such a hard time getting him to go to sleep and one time he stayed up for 10 hours straight at like 3 weeks old... it was crazy.  He was also breastfed and would eat like every hour for a half an hour during the day and didn't get up much to eat at night at all.  But like I said it did eventually get better and I really don't remember when everything fell into place just know it will get better.|`|xMNpzFzGaa	Play with him longer when he's awake. It could be that he's learning the difference between night and day too.|`|ae8nVXBpaa	you could try putting him down when he's in slow wave sleep so that he will be less likely to wake up. if he's in REM sleep (short for rapid eye movement) he won't be sleeping as deeply and will be more likely to notice when you put him down. you'll know he's in REM sleep because if you look at his eyelids you will see that he has rapid eye movements during this stage. so to reduce the chance of him waking up when you put him down, put him down after he's been asleep for 5-10 minutes but not during REM sleep.    also, make sure he is warm enough. he could just be sleeping better on you because you are warm.
4wTbdsJgaa	Guys are always paying attention to girls.  They are constantly looking for signs that girls like them.  If you just talk to him a little more, or give him a compliment or two, he will definitely take the hint.

Slowly ease into conversation gradually and get comfortable together, and it may come naturally.  Don't avoid him completely, since he will take that to mean you are too shy to talk to him. (That is not always bad, but it depends) But don't stalk him or anything.|`|n5zZkbqNaa	ha ha.  gosh!! i swear i'm not laughing at you!!  but i just had really bad deja vu.  i was in your same situation in 7th/8th grade.    i ended up eventually dating the guy, but i didn't tell him that i liked him for 3 years. it didn't last very long because the flame for me was gone.    just tell him that you like him, that's the best that you can do.  if he likes you, what's the harm in you liking him?  see?  simple:)    honestly, though, don't worry so much about it.  just go to the dance without a date and see him there.  dance with him.  and maybe something will happen.    on top of that, seriously, focus on your studies.  i was (and still am) wrapped up in boy-drama and i was (and still am) failing some classes.  now i'm looking at college apps, i'm fifteen and a freshmen, by the way, and i realize now that i need to worry about science and not whether a guy likes me or not.    my boyfriend and i have been on and off for two years, trust me, things are easier once you're out of middle school.  and, on top of that, guys are a little bit easier to understand once you hit 9th grade.    promise:)|`|sH1LgUN4aa	just tell him you like him and be your self if he liked you before he probably will like you again and it's the perfect timing for you to tell him because he's no longer with his girl

And then it won't be a secret :P|`|MIUzgwsTaa	(shh)    Get closer    A little closer    Now promise not to tell anybody    *Whisper in to your ear..."it's a secrect so I can't tell you"    (shh)|`|brvOa9QYaa	haha why ?|`|7ZNRqKbKaa	dont really have one to be honest with you. haha.|`|CFU77qCbaa	Why the hell would you care? And if I would never tell anyone, why would you ask?|`|gILygKvRaa	It's a secret|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Well if I say what it is then it won't be a secret anymore!      **I see dead people...they're everywhere...they don't they're dead...|`|Inc78M0Raa	None of my friends know my secret.  But here it is:  People always ask how I go the scar on my wrist, (It's not on the under-side of my wrist, it's about where you would would wear a bracelet) and I always tell them I don't remember where it came from. But the truth, is that 2 years ago my dad attacked me with a knife. I now hate knives and if you point one at me I will totally freak out.  I plan on telling my guy friend that am really close to. I just want someone to know, I hate keeping it to myself.|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	i think i have one..
iIJm5JToaa	God the things kids do.  Ok, first, get a bungee cord for the fridge.  Easy to adjust the height, multiple uses, including fridge lock.    Second, and I don't know how much you've told your kid up to this point, but explain to him that if he puts the puppy in the fridge, the puppy will have to go live in heaven, and he won't be able to see him anymore.  Nice way of saying he will die that won't scare the crap out a little boy. Or tell him that dogs only go in fridges before they go to heaven, not when they're babies, or they will get sick.  Think of it in his terms, all he knows is sick is bad, heaven means no more, and hurt is bad.  Tell him you asked the dog mommy, and she said the puppy doesn't like the fridge and wants your son to stop.  If he loves the dog, he might understand if you say you talked to her (hey, he probably thinks dogs can talk to you)    Third, if he keeps it up, he needs consequences for his actions, whatever parenting style you have. But let him know it hurts the puppy, even though he doesn't mean too.  Tell him he's the puppys big brother, and a good big brother leaves the little ones with their mom.    The people that say you have no control don't have kids, or their kids are little autobots that never do anything funny or creative.  Your kid isn't nuts, as adults we know fridges are dangerous, a kid doesn't.  You can accomplish two goals here, save the puppy, and teach your child about the dangers of fridges.      My sister and I used to lock each other in the trunk of the car around that age.  Why?  Because we thought it was funny.  We wern't psycos, we just didn't know any better (until my mom caught us, and whooped our butts, then told us why it was bad). We thought it was a cool hiding place.  As an adult, I realize how dumb it is, but a kid?  They'll do stuff when your back is turned.  If they didn't they're wouldn't be emergency rooms, syrup of ipicac, or bandaids with Dora on them.|`|tpfxZZADaa	I think you need to give your son some hard love (read: discipline).    He understands what he is doing, you have explained to him that the pup can be injured and he is giving excuses for putting the puppy in the fridge.  If he keeps that up, you may have a very angry dog in your house soon, a dog that may bite or scratch your playful son. Or you may have a dead dog.    I suggest next time you catch him, give him time out. Make his stand in a corner (nose touching the wall) for at least four minutes. Use the stove timer, and restart it the first few times he breaks, talks, cries or does anything like say he is sorry. Make sure he "cools off", but don't let it take more than twenty minutes.  Then explain to him, that the puppy will die if he keeps up those antics, and that your punishment of making him cool off in the corner was fair considering he could kill the animal playing around like that.    I just wonder, if you are encouraging the behavior a little at the moment. Are you laughing, or something that makes your little boy think he is doing something that is actually harmless.|`|lhOd2hvXaa	How on earth does any child have free access to a 2 week old puppy?    EDIT:  You are reading MUCH more into my reply than intended. Killing machines? Oh the drama!  A 2 week old puppy should NOT be handled by anyone other than a responsible adult.  We don't even let our 8 year old handle pups that age unless she is sitting on the floor and is supervised by an adult.  A 2 week old puppy taken from its dam and litter could VERY easily die of exposure put into the refrigerator for the smallest amount of time!!!|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	whoop his butt if he does it, he will get the message.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Cindy D is correct, if he won't listen then he needs to have his access to the fridge and the other appliances restricted, and/or his access to the puppy restricted as well.  Yes he's a little boy and it's common for them not to get it, but he will remember this if he does end up hurting the puppy and it will be on you for allowing it to happen!|`|rAkWoweOaa	LOL!! It is funny!! I think that is cute, but like you I would never condone it. You will have to put ice on his skin and ask him if he likes being cold like that. Of course he won't and he will understand what that puppy is going through.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Put him in the corner every time he does it for 4 minutes. Do it every time he does it consistently. Tell him that he is not to do it anymore and if he does he goes to the corner for it. IF he does it again after you have told him then start corner time... if he gets out of the corner, then put him back in, as many times as it takes, telling him only once that his time starts when he is standing there quietly. When putting him back in the corner(if you have this problem) do not talk to him after the first time of telling him when time starts, and do not look at him... he will eventually get the point and stop!|`|77lIzq4Taa	From reading your Question and Additions you are not going to want to hear this but I'll speak my mind. Why is a 4year old EVER left unattended with a litter less than 8 weeks old if then?   A 2 week old puppy does not have the temperature regulation at that age to survive hardly any time in a refrigerator or hidden under a couch or in a closet.  In my house a 4 year old will be corrected and be told that such actions are unacceptable the first time they handle a puppy with out supervision. That they will not and are not allowed to be in contact with the litter without myself or a responsible adult being there to supervise, that if they do not obey that's right I said OBEY me they might and could kill the puppy they love. Might not be what you wish to hear but too bad. Don't ask if you don't want  to hear  opinions.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You need to put a safety latch on the fridge.  Also one on the oven and the dryer.  And he's two years old, you HAVE to watch over him 24/7.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Tell him that if he puts the puppy in the fridge, it will eat all the food or maybe even get so cold he will freeze and die, and then you will either a)not have food or b) not have a dog anymore. Poor puppy!     if he does it again, i would take a toy away or ban him from playing with the puppy!|`|fDXrRtkHaa	Every time he does it, give him a swat on the bottom. He won't like it, and he'll learn. Be sure not to laugh, which i am sure you must have if he thinks it's funny... But just follow through.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	you could tell him that it's not funny and the puppy will die. or you might have to actually watch him 24/7 until he stops. if you say no to him but he still does and thinks it's funny - someone is not taking it seriously and he is picking up on it.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	You need to halt this behaviour right now.  He is not a normal boy.  Children of his age that harm animals are statistically likely to become adults that abuse other people.      Why don't you lock him in the fridge and see how he likes it?      Seriously, you need to get this child to a psychologist or counselor and possibly give up the puppy.  It is cruel and is only a matter of time before the animal gets truly hurt or killed.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I'm having a hard time taking you seriously...    A 2 week old pup needs around the clock care (as they should never be taken from their mothers prior to 8 weeks.)  The fact that you have an animal this young and allow your four year old unsupervised access to it is downright scary.  I can only hope you are trolling...    The solution here is to monitor your son.  And not take in anymore infant animals since you aren't prepared to handle them.|`|CeqbfVscaa	tell your son of the consequences of putting the dog in the fridge.If he does it again put your son in time out.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	You can tell him that dogs have their own way to stay cool,that they pant. Tell him that it gets too cold in the fridge for the puppy and that puppy needs to be with momma dog for warmth/ coolness.    Do you keep the momma dog and litter inside? When one of my dogs had pups we always seperated the momma and litter from everyone else. We had a huge back yard and a seperate area for the mom and pups, that way to keep them safe from the other dogs and my little cousins/neighbors that came to visit.    We never allowed our pups to be handled by anyone but one other person, not until the pups were old enough. 2 weeks is too young for a child to handle. I'm not trying to be mean. Accidents can happen...    My cousin loves puppies. She's 3 and she likes to pet them only its not really petting...she more like pats them, sorta hard so we had to show her the right way to do that. She also likes to pick them up the wrong way...I never left her unsupervised with my dogs and the pups, not only for her safety but theirs as well. When their teeth come in, they can nip and bite. For a small child that can seriously hurt, even draw blood.|`|AA10754660	put a lock on the fridge or get rid of the dog until hes old enough to learn...|`|b0YxgQMMaa	Just by asking this shows you're an incompetent parent and dog owner, controlling a four year old isn't that difficult shame on you!|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	buy some of those locks for the fridge, freezer, toilet, dryer washer etc.    You know after I posted I got to thinking, I read it wrong too & thought it said he was 2. Still I would put  the locks ont he fridge. Yeah it's not very convenient, but it's something you have to do. I had to do it because my 4 yr old would sneak food, even after having a big meal. Also, he's FOUR, you can talk to him & tell him flat out that if the puppy goes int he fridge again he'll have to find a new home because he will die. Four yr olds are much smarter than people give them credit for.|`|bufQfEqbaa	Be completely honest, tell him it will hurt or can kill the dog.  If he keeps doing it, he needs consequences.  You need to be consistent every time he does it.  If that means losing play time, a toy, a movie, etc. You need to do it every time he puts the dog in the fridge.  I feel bad for the dog.  2 week old dog shouldn't probably be playing with a four year old yet.|`|dfBjPB1laa	Hmmm, well first of all I'm not sure a safety latch on the fridge would even help.  My son is 4 and he's autistic and can defeat all those latches for the fridge and freezer.    Um, ok.  So I think your son will eventually stop.  The puppy is only a couple weeks old and is new.  Your son doesn't understand.  I think I would keep explaining that the puppy will get too cold in there.  Maybe everytime you find the puppy in the fridge (or know your son is going to put the puppy there) you can say to him, something like "Oh no, we can't put the puppy in the fridge.  Puppy doesn't like to be cold.  Lets cuddle him instead."  Then get a small blanket or towel and help your son sit on the couch and cover himself and the puppy up.      Or you can put up a safety gate to keep the puppy in one room.    You could put your son on time out everytime he does it.     Those are about the only ideas I have.  I don't have dogs, but my mom does and when I take my son to her house we have to lock the dogs in the bedroom because my son thinks he can ride them.  He just... doesn't know any better.    Good luck.  Give it a little time, it'll be ok.
9vz1bsFzaa	There is nothing wrong with you! You are making the best out of the year by having good grades, staying out of trouble and avoiding guys (you are right about the perv-immaturity thing). I think you are wonderful they way you are, and it's better to have a few good friends than be "popular" with a lot of kids who'll end up shredding you to pieces behind your back! You are cute, smart, and your own person, and I don't think there is anything wrong with that!|`|S3t69kh2aa	Now is a good time to pick up a new hobby, or music or whatever you are interested in.  There will be more opportunities in high school, but you too need to make a move to meet others.  Join clubs, and start talking to people!  Ask questions.  I hope things pick up for you this year.|`|GLXWgR9qaa	dont worry god bless u|`|N2O9rJvUaa	just try not to beso shy n try to socialize with other girls|`|ieusQoDRaa	I completely understand what you are saying.  I'm 22 years old now, but looking back over everything, the best way to make more friends who you will really click with, is to get involved in stuff.  Find some clubs at your school that you like.  Have you thought about playing tennis?  I understand you don't have money for lessons, but for example, you could try out for your schools tennis team, (its usually a spring sport), you can get a cheap racket for $20, and bond with the other girls practicing.  (That's what I did...our tennis team was nothing, so they could use a person who had even no experience).  Also try community service somewhere.  Find something you are interested in, contact them, and you'll defintely meet people with the same interests as you.    Sports, clubs, community service, all really awesome ways to meet people, and keep yourself active.
bAp35x7uaa	Anything that raises your overall temperature may cause defects so you are strongly advised to avoid hot tubs and saunas. HOWEVER they do say *may* not *will*.  Just avoid them in future and have a chat with your midwife if you're worried.|`|yB5go5wbaa	the baby can't regulate its body temperature like you can.|`|RrPjG9x9aa	being in a hot tub raises your body temp, and that can make the environment your baby is developing in fluctuate, which is not good for baby's development.  the way I look at it, why risk it?|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I've also heard you aren't supposed to. But I'm not really sure why.|`|giRRCXU4aa	My doctor told me the maximum amount of time you can be in a hot tub is about 10 minutes. It raises your body temperature and that's definitely not a good thing to do. I haven't gotten in a hot tub my whole pregnancy just to be safe. I'd talk to your doctor.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	do not go into a hot tub while pregnant. it can harm the baby because of  the intense temperature.     also, it says right on the hot tub: do not go in while pregnant.|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I did a lot of research about that issue with my last pregnancy.  I determined that it is ok to go in a hot tub while pregnant if the temperature is under 100 degrees.  I kept my hot tub at 98 degrees to be safe.  That's about the same as a bath tub really and baths are safe as well unless the water is too hot.  My doctor confirmed that it's ok to go in the hot tub if the water was under 100 degrees.|`|WcvsBgLuaa	I read that it isn't safe for a developing baby because the water is so hot.|`|W1p6LetFaa	The danger lies in the temperature of the water because of how it can raise YOUR body temperature.  If your body temperature rises above 102 degrees, it can harm your baby or even cause a miscarriage.  You may still go in a hottub while pregnant, but the water should NEVER be above 100 degrees while you are in the tub.  Or if you can't lower the temp, you shouldn't be in the water for more than a few minutes, or just put your feet in.  Especially when you're 8 months pregnant, NOTHING feels better than being weightless in that water!  Just be sure the temperature isn't above 100 degrees.    (The other thing to be careful of is just getting in and out of the tub.  When you are big, it's a lot easier to slip and fall.)    Good luck to you!!|`|w4zjmhxoaa	It's not healthy to let your body temp. rise above 101 degrees when you're pregnant (from a fever, hot day, or a hot tub).  Most hot tub temps are set higher than that.  It can cause birth defects, health problems for the baby, and miscarriage    It's best not to risk it    http://babymed.com/Blog/Blog.aspx?75    http://miscarriage.about.com/od/lifestyl...|`|fHgbL046aa	I heard going in a hot tub is not good for your child because of the tempeture. I also heard you should never have sex in a pool or hot tub because the risk of infection to the women.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	The hot water is not good for the baby.  It increases the temperature of the amniotic fluid which could cause changes in fetal development.  Not to sound cruel but in a sense you are boiling your baby.  Talk to your doctor but it is not recommended at all during a pregnancy.|`|WwCBomTMaa	The baby is already really warm inside of your body. Add another high temperature, such as sitting in a hot tub, and you could literally boil your child (at least that is how my doctor discribed it when I was pregnant), And another thing is that all of those chemicals they put in the hot tubs can cause birth defects and retardation.|`|627pWyVkaa	No you cant go in hot tubs! Your heating your baby inside of you. And No im not just saying this! Look it up in pregnancy books. It clearly states No sauna's or hot tubs and if you MUST the temperature has too be below 38.9 C!!!!|`|BRHANhYwaa	As far as I know, its not healthy to get into a hot tub while pregnant. Basically anything that can cause your internal body temperature to rise high is not safe. This also goes for over-doing it while exercising.|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	I hear that its not good that your body temperature is not to exceed 100 and a hot tub gets pretty warm I don't know exactly why but I as well couldn't get into a hot tub because of that reason and im pretty sure the doctor knows why he says things so ill listen to him.    Good Luck  :)|`|KNxs4PrZaa	nope sorry, raising your body temperature to the level that hot tubs are usually kept at (above 100 degree) is dangerous for the baby, it can cause brain damage and birth defects.  I am sure no harm was done during one quick dip in the hottub but i would avoid doing it again.  If you are needing something to warm up and relax take a warm bath in your tub, the water out of the faucet and in the tub wont get hot enough to cause a problem.  If you own the hot tub then turn the heat down to 99 degrees and try that, it may not feel as good but it wont be dangerous.|`|yCUOXInFaa	You do need to be cautious about "hot" baths as there is little known about the possible effects on the blood flowing through the placenta or on the baby. If the water is too hot, you could also feel faint or sick, as it could lower your blood pressure a bit too much - not a good thing as that could lead to fainting/collapsing!
NvycINb7aa	im 16 34DD...     ive had at least a C since i was in 6th grade and im not over weight at all...  i completly understand i have horrid back problems! my nipples are not fully developed either but i havent gotten any bigger i normally went up a cup size every year.. the best thing to do is exercise and they willl get smaller. but after you have kids i would consider surgery thats what im doing|`|Bcfw1rweaa	ooh i feel you!  im 13, just turned 13  and i am a F   I was about a B in 3rd grade and they have been growing ever since! im gonna get a breast reduction when i turn 18.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Having my period at 9 I was a 36 DD at 13 and by the time they stopped growing I was a F.

Ask your parents if you can get a breast reduction.|`|IYzMqNJDaa	Are you sure the 14 is right? I have never heard of a 14.     Ok 36 that's better. You should just about be done with puberty so you should be about done growing.  You can't make them smaller without surgery unless you are heavy you can lose some weight and they may get a little smaller.|`|gILygKvRaa	REDUCTION you troll|`|Inc78M0Raa	This is why I like having A-cups.  They don't almost hit you in the face when your running.  And you don't have as much strain on your back from the weight.  But I would suggest getting a reduction.  They could cause back problems for you later in life.|`|rnZoebKQaa	are you braggin or complainin?|`|K3RzcMRTaa	WHAT THE ****.  get a REDUCTION.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	i dont think theylll grow anymore;)|`|nrGsxWw3aa	I think you should stop growing pretty soon.  I was DD since I was 14 years old.  I had breast reduction 2 years ago and it was the best decision of my life!  I am now 33 and if I would have know how happy I was going to be I would have done much sooner.|`|70kh6VSoaa	wow they should stop growing soon talk to your mom and if your both concerned talk to a dr|`|ieusQoDRaa	well, you obviously can't make your nipples smaller w/o surgery.  and there is no such size as 14....so I don't think you are for real.  It would be impossible to go from a C to an E in a month unless you are pregnant.  So don't waste peoples time heffer.
eeRLckg5aa	My kids are 2, 3, and 5. My sisters, who's kids are grown, keep telling me...it gets worse as they get older. I do dread having 3 teenagers all at once.

They will never listen they wont know the meaning of no and why will forever be the worst word in the world|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Your house will never be quite again until they move out! With my older 4 kids we did not have "terrible twos' but we had HORRIFIC threes!!!  My kids still do not always listen but get disciplined when they choose not to. You have to maintain order in your house. And with my only daughter the horrific threes are now repeating themselves at age 6, melt downs, fit pitching, crying over nothing, etc.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	they dont, do you listen to your parents now?  lol, your house will be quiet when they move out and they will never listen to you.  sorry.|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	I will be quiet again when they are gone. I have a 5 year that is in school and a soon to be 2 year old in April. They never listen. I ask my 2 year old a question and the answer is always no. And my 5 year old thinks that she is the queen of the house. It never gets better.|`|o68Zageuaa	LISTEN???? omg the minute there born they hear but don't listen, it gets worse the older they get too, and as for a quiet house, you have to wait till they have left home before that becomes a reality,|`|nrGsxWw3aa	My daughter started to listen when she was around 4 1/2.  As for my two year old son he is always on the go and does his own thing.  I am hoping he will listen soon because I am really really tired!|`|snAtqVG9aa	i have a 4 year old and a two year old. the four year old thinks she is the head of the house and the two year old is   not that bad. i can yell constantly at my 4 year old and it goes in one ear and out the other.|`|IErPuZnkaa	Quit yelling!  The more you yell, the more conditioned they become to it and the easier it is to tune it out.  Start talking quietly but still enact the same punishment.  They will also get quiet to listen instead of yelling over you.  I make a point to NOT yell because it really does no good...  Be quiet but stay firm.  It might help with the listening and the control.
gILygKvRaa	HATE IT!!!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	no, not since middle school.|`|y6406A92aa	Never have ...|`|7ZNRqKbKaa	uhh i hate it when people do that. it sends the same text like 30 times every 5 seconds. its annoying.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Never happened to me...yet.|`|I64JOuMKaa	LMAO  i've never been mass texted  but i've mass texted people before !    you can put the person on your block list so you dont get their texts!|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Nope.

All the time,  it's SO annoying. :P  But who know's how to stop it?   Lordyy!  (:|`|cN9sOZfDaa	ah, it's so annoying >.  i hate it.    i don't give out my number to people who i know send those out alot (:  easy.    or i tell them i can't txt anymore or else :]|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Lol, never.    Wow, how does that happen, anyhow?  That'd cost a **** load.
YqeatZB4aa	My one year old does a lot of the same things. He is will burry his face in the ground and scream until someone comes and gets him or gives him what he wants. What I do is I ignore it. When he starts screaming and acting like that I ignore him and start doing something else, or even get up and walk into another room. Usually he will fallow me so I will leave that room until he gets the point and starts playing. I learned from helping with my sister's kids if you don't give in and you ignore the tantrums then they will learn that it is not how to get their way. If you are in the store simply leave your cart gather  up all your things and take him to the car and tell him that if he wants to scream and yell he can do it here and not in the store. My son understands what I say to him, although he can't really talk back other than to say no, momma, dada, mamma and he nods. Someimtes he has other words but not all the time. But he knows what I mean when i tell him things. Good Luck|`|n86P8yccaa	yup its very normal|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Of course thats normal!!! My 1yr old does that same thing. He screams, arches his back, kicks his legs, and now he slaps too! I didn't spoil him either! Think about it...your child has feelings just like adults, anger, frustration, happy, sad ect.. But he cant put word to his feelings, so he acts on them. He telling you how he's feeling in the only way he knows how.|`|70kh6VSoaa	awww yes its very normal|`|PQQipirDaa	terrible twos that phrase can be very deceiving. What you are experiencing is completely normal both of my kids terrible twos started at 13 to 15 months and my son's lasted until he was nearly 5, although it did get much better at 4. Don't think when he turns three you are out of the water yet.    Actually from what people tell me it never gets better, only worse and worse until they are adults.  Although my son is at a very cooperative age of 5 right now. it's great for the time being however my daughter is full force terrible two's at nearly 23 months and yes we've been at it for quite some time.   Have fun and try to keep your sanity.    Avoid power assertion and harsh punishment. Foster a secure attachment and provide lots of love. Dont be overprotective, Do expose child to new people and places.  It's hard to tell whether he can use the words correctly to tell you what he wants or his feelings because all children develop at different rates. Try getting him to point etc... and use words as much as possible you could also introduce some signs as well as words such as more, please, book , no, eat, all done, etc...|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	My son's "terrible twos" started at 10 months old.  He's been throwing temper tantrums, and holding his breath, and all of that..for a long time.  He's only 18 months now so I just cannot wait to see what happens when he actually hits 2!|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	Yes very normal. He is probably to young to use words to help you understand. Some tips don't give in ex.if it's nap time and you put him down for nap and he starts screaming and throwing a fit. If you know he's okay and ready for nap don't give in and pick him up. When he realizes you're not giving in (it may take a while) he will stop. You have to be consistent. Its not neglect or bad parenting. Now is a good time to break it though if you let it continue it gets worse and harder to break.
iVcaB9h7aa	Adoption statistics aren't routinely gathered so there is no accurate data to answer your question.  Here is some information for the US:    1992 Was the Last Year National Adoption Totals Were Gathered  The total number of adoptions each year has not been comprehensively compiled since 1992. While there are reporting mechanisms for foster care and international adoptions, states are not legally required to record the number of private, domestic adoptions. In 1992, the National Center for State Courts gathered adoption totals from a variety of sources, and estimated that 126,951 children were adopted through international, foster care, private agency, independent and step-parent adoptions. [4] NCSC estimated that stepparent adoptions accounted for 42% of all adoptions and foster care adoptions 15%. [5]     -http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/researc...    There is one trend that can be identified with a high degree of certainty. At the current time, a far greater number of adults seek to adopt newborn infants than the number of newborn infants available to be adopted. Published statistics indicate that there are 3.3 adoption seekers for every child that is actually adopted.     Additional statistics indicate that 20,000 or more newborn infants are placed for adoption each year in the United States. It is also true that 11% to 24% of couples that experience infertility decide to pursue adoption.    -http://www.families4kids.org/adoption/da...

mFZGIPcWaa	Funny you say you were sitting indian style cuz when I went into labor with my twins, I was sitting on the bed indian style too and felt a little gush then went to bathroom and whooo laaaaa...was my water. Then the contractions started. But some women don't have contractions right away when they go into labor. It is possible that some of your water is breaking, but not all. I would call your doctor and ask him just in case. You and your baby are most important and because it is your first pregnancy, every ones body is different. Congrats on the little bun.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	During pregnancy you can get lots of different discharge. Since you say it was clear and like liquid you might want to wait a little longer to see if more comes out and if so go to get it checked out.|`|ZTb7O6VJaa	It could potentially be your water... I would call your Dr and ask them what they think as not all women have the "big gush" everyone talks about... They will most likely have you come in and get monitored... They will also do a couple of checks to see whether there are signs of your water being broken... They do a specimen test... Check for pooling which uses the same tools as a pap... And then a chemical test which reacts to the hormones in the amniotic fluid... Good luck... And congrats as you might have a baby soon!!!|`|EpuVj5imaa	If I were you I would go get checked. It is always better to be safe than sorry. I had that happen during my first pregnancy and it was my water breaking. I also thought it happened during my second and third pregnancy and it wasn't my water breaking. Its hard to tell sometimes so its best to leave it to the professionals.|`|PkbPOWzsaa	it might be nothing wrong but if i where you i would've called my doctor instead of loosing time typing and waiting for the answers.Even if you been paranoid its better to have answers from professionals especially from your doctor.call him now!!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, you're not paranoid.  Go get checked.  There is a very high chance of infection if you don't deliver within 24 hours after your water breaks.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	ANYTIME you think that you broke your water, you need to call your ob/gyn and get it checked out!   Until you have it checked insert NOTHING into your vagina, no fingers no penis, nothing - and check your temperature, if you have a fever go directly in anyway if you suspect premature rupture of the membranes.   You won't be loosing face if you are right, and even if you are wrong at least you'll know!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Your water could be leaking and not to scair you but if it continues and alot starts to come out but not the GUSH of it breaking go to the er because if water is just slowly leaking this can cut of oxogyn and you could loose you little one. BUT if it is just that little bit wait untill monday and call your ob and make an apt. They can cheack you water. Good luck god bless|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	that happened to me too actually. im 32 weeks with twins. my stomach is also rock hard and i have no idea whats going on.  sorry i dont know what it is, this is my first pregnancy as well. but i just wanted to let you know im in the same boat.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	If you ever think your water has broken, go to the ER (or doctor's office if they are open).|`|ZncV5gc0aa	It could just be pee, but regardless you need to go to the hospital. They can test to see if it is amniotic fluid. Better safe than sorry.|`|giKCTfnfaa	you need to go to the er.  they need to check to see if it leaking.  it's nothing painful, just a strip of paper.  if it's leaking, they'll contact the dr and possibly admit you.  an opening in the amniotic sac invites in bacteria and could lead to infection.
yCUOXInFaa	Not necessarily.....only if it is severe, meaning  if the placenta's detaches itself from the uterine wall ...... the baby is no longer getting oxygen or nutrition. Immediate delivery is almost always recommended, often by cesarean section.  You may be advised to take complete bed rest untill your baby is born....|`|suVispAAaa	It is highly possible but not a definite. Depends on the circumstances at the time of the birth. You could go in & try having the baby vaginal & then they could say we have to do a c-section, or you could go in and they could find out & tell you right away you need a c-section or you could have the baby vaginal, not easy to answer. What you should do is either go in as if you are getting a c-section, that way you will be preparing your self & then if you do not need one great! Or you could go in prepared for both, & what happens happens!! Sometimes the answer is not know until the actual time when you go into labor & get ready to deliver. Good luck!!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	It depends on the degree that it's detached. If there is the risk of it completely detaching during labor they will do a c-section because it can suffocate your baby.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	you should have a conversation with your doctor about this...thats what they are there for. :o)|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	Yes you are more and likely going to have to get a c section it is a safety issue and it is safer for the baby to come out through c section then natural because of that it is defiantly the preferred choice    GOOD LUCK  :)
t1fx6kXcaa	At that age my son had black beans, lentil, chickpeas etc. I always cut them up but at 10 months I didn't mash them. Large chickpeas & black beans may be choking hazards if left whole. If the baby swallows small whole beans, than they will pass into their nappies (diapers) whole, undigested. They will absorb more nutrients if they are mashed or cut up and the baby chews/gums them before swallowing.   Also, black beans are more nutritious if you cook them yourself (rather than use canned), and cook them until they are just soft (not mushy). Bring them to the boil and then simmer until just cooked.   My son eats a lot of legumes and enjoys them. They are a good alternative to meat.  Good luck!|`|TVx4iWlGaa	My daughter had beans when she was about a year old and the poor thing had gas so bad she cried the rest of the day. I felt so horrible and I havent given them to her since. She is 2 now and only eats green beans.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Hmm. Well, I give my daughter beans (she's 10 months) and if she doesn't chew it and just swallows, it usually goes down fine and by that I mean she doesn't start choking. I know sometimes she doesn't chew them because they're whole in her stools, but as long as you're near your baby and keep an eye on them while they eat IMO it's fine to give the beans whole, BUT if you would feel more comfortable mashing them, just do that.|`|68c6B8dRaa	No, whole beans are fine. Black beans are pretty small to start with.     No, re 'harder to process.' He will gum them up. The odd one may be swallowed whole or nearly whole, but it's quite harmless.    Do check out:  http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i have yet to give my son beans and he is almost 2 and a half.. i'm just paranoid that they will upset his stomach.. i'm not really concerned about the choking part though.    i would mush them up a bit before feeding them to baby. and when he gets a bit older, try giving them whole.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My 14 month old eats black eyed peas every night for dinner, it is actually his favorite food! He has been eating these since he was probably 9 months old or so and he did not get his first tooth until almost 11 months. Of course he is my 5th child so am a lot less paranoid then many other mom's about what he eats, I've caught my older kids giving him all sorts of things he should not be eating do to a "choking hazard" but he seems to get it all down just fine! Just make sure you are sitting with him in case he for some reason does choke a little.|`|avx7bLnKaa	if your baby is able to eat cherrios or other foods requiring chewing they can eat the black beans....  black beans are small enough not to choke on and easily smashed with the baby's gums and/or teeth    my son loves beans and he's been eating them for a while.... and he didn't get teeth until 11 months    I've never noticed black beans to cause much gas or be hard on tummy
w4XE9M7uaa	Well, just talk to him on the phone if you can.

819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	Im 32 weeks pregnant right now and in 15 weeks i didnt gain more then like 5 pounds now its like 25 pounds and im 32 weeks pregnant you are supposed to gain 25-35 that is what my doctor told me is normal.    Good Luck    :)|`|ZncV5gc0aa	5 lbs is great. A  lot of women lose weight from morning sickness at first, so you are doing great!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	it is normally between 2 to 4 pounds but some women lose some from throwing up and some gain more from being able to keep more down|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	it depends on how much you give into the cravings. my mother is an OB/GYN and I think she said that anymore than 3x the baby's ideal weight isn't good for the entire pregnancy. I know that it'll be difficult but don't give into the cravings EVERY time because your risk of prenatal diabetes significantly increases :/|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Well, the best answer to this question is that if you're really pregnant, you should be seeking REAL medical care and guidance through your pregnancy and NOT asking random people on Yahoo who may or may not give you good answers!    At the very least, you should get a couple good books from the bookstore or library which should give you hints about nutrition, exercise, milestones and signs to watch out for as opposed to what is normal.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	you are doing fine at this point. just dont get carried away.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Every women is different. Sounds like you were pretty tiny when you got pregnant. Just try to stay within the recommend weight gain of 25 to 35 lbs. With my 1st I had gained about 12 lbs by the time I was 15 weeks, with my 6th I did not gain any weight until my 7th month.|`|qBdbYH3caa	No it's normal|`|eemmWU0Haa	go on fortune baby.com and there's a weight tracker there, it should help you out. its a free site as well  Good Luck!|`|qLkknQx1aa	no such thing as normal while pregnant so you'll need to get that out of your head straight away... - every woman is different as is each pregnancy. - i gained 60 lbs with both of my pregnancies, bounced back to my pre-baby weight within a few months. - some women gain 10 lbs and then gain even after the baby is born. - don't worry yourself with statistics or what is "normal", just follow doctor's orders and HAVE FUN !!!!!!!!! - i love how i'm getting the thumbs down from people... , don't be haters., gosh, i guess telling her to have fun is just a horrible thing to say... i should be struck down.. - lighten up people.|`|895XRbnJaa	wow that is such a coincidence before i was pregnant i was 5'2 and 109 lbs. anyways i didnt gain much at all in the first trimester, some people even lose weight. but as long as you dont go overboard on the weight gaining you will be okay. If you gain to much your doctor will tell you or if you are worried you can just ask.|`|3VR3u22Laa	it's natural|`|o9u4H6m6aa	I'd have to agree with the people who said, there's no normal weight gain in pregnancy. There is an Average, but that doesn't mean that non-average people have a problem.   Listen to your body! Don't get preoccupied with numbers!  The important thing is that you eat healthy and as much or as little as you feel like.  If you are not eating healthy right now, figure out how you can better get what your body needs, not focus on increasing or decreasing your weight gain.  If you are eating well, then good for you. Relax. There is an extremely wide range of "normal" in pregnancy.|`|fHgbL046aa	With my daughter I gained 39 pounds. I am 5'5 and weighted 110pounds before getting pregnant. That was 15 years ago.   I am 17 weeks pregnant with my second and I was153 pounds before I got pregnant and have lost weight (I'm 145LB) which concerns me. I will be seeing the doctor on February 3. The weird thing is my belly sticks out quite a bit and I eat all the time.|`|p89KSfznaa	no thats totally normal
d0e10e643d80c474c11bc076052dc77aaa	The same thing happened when I switched my son to soy, he was always constipated. We now use Enfamil Gentlease. Way better. I also tried the prune juice and water, that only loosened the poop that was still being "made", as for the poop that needs to come out I got baby suppositories and only used half, and within half an hour he went poop and cleaned out his system. I recommend if you are going to continue soy, then adding more fluids to your babys feedings, water or Pedialyte.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	2 oz of prune juice mixed with 2 oz of water   or pedilyte     r try switching to soy formula if ur using formula of course|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	HONESTLY I gave both my son's prunes. I KNOW most people are so worried about giving babies food but look my kids are 100% healthy and good to go and amazing never been sick EVER and they were eating real food at 3 months old (they had teeth). Feed her a little bit of prunes from gerber baby food. and she will love the new taste  not juice FOOD|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Check out Dr Sears Website. he has an extensive page on helping with constipation. There's too much for me to rewrite for you.    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081100...|`|S4z7mefcaa	Try glycerine suppositories.  She's really too young for juice.  Introducing juice prematurely can cause different problems including allergies.    Good luck!|`|IVSqQQzlaa	Two months is too young for juice.  I made that mistake with my first because I didn't know any better and it caused all kinds of problems (like severe rash and then allergies, etc.).  Try a warm bath and rub her belly while she's in the tub.  Also, if your formula has added iron you should switch to one that doesn't.  I remember trying suppositories with a couple of my babies and they definitely helped but I can't remember how old they have to be.  I think they can be used quite early though.    Good luck - hope your babe is feeling better soon! :)|`|dTLTNZTzaa	Prune juice is not recommended until baby is 6 months old. Did your baby had problem with formula before? Why did you switch?|`|AfSwDFRcaa	Try prune juice concentrated with water... My friend had a similar problem the other day with her 2 month old... It's what the doc said to do.|`|xMNpzFzGaa	Why don't you ask your baby's pediatrician? I gave my kids apple juice back then when they were older than 3 months, I'm not sure if that would be alright for a 2 month old. Might be too acidic for her.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Why would you not give her Dark karo syrup? It works like a dream and it safe and all natural verus some of these other things. No baby should be having stools this hard at this young age. If you don't want to see her suffer than why put her thru this any longer? Prune juice and water wil not act as quickly as karo and also to much water is not good. My pediatrician always recommended the karo first.|`|tnKhIUK1aa	I am an RN but also a mother. Before I was a nurse, I had a very constipated baby who screamed from the pain.  I brought him to his pediatrician who did not know what to do.  I tried 7 different formulas and he did not digest any of them.  Breastmilk is the best because if helps with the immunities in the baby and is easy to digest.  If you are giving formula, iron will constipate the baby.  Babies are mostly water, so be careful regarding dehydration.  Babies could die from dehydration quickly.  Get the baby to a doctor if the baby is not drinking.  Also the baby may later on suffer from what the professionals call "failure to thrive" if baby is not eating.  This is very important...Get the baby to a doctor...My baby did not want to drink breast milk or formula because he was constipated and related eating to pain.  I tried everything on the market.  Even baby enemas and suppositories.  Nothing worked.  In desparation, I opened the book "Back to Eden" and read about raspberry tea enemas.  Make tea and let it cool.  I put it into a syringe and gave my baby a raspberry tea enema and everything came out.  Prior to that the suppositories only let the liquid comes out with a small amount of the hard stools that had the appearance of rabbit stools out.  He was still in pain.  With the raspberry tea enemas, it all came out.  I had to be creative in my desparate need to relieve the pain that my son had when he was an infant.  Run this by your doctor first.  But if all else fails....the herbal tea helped him...The doctor also had me put him on a formula called Neutramegen...a formula that was hydrogenized and filtered through charcoal.  It stunk like rotten eggs, but he eventually drank it.  It is very expensive and was a powdered form in a can and I had to add water to it. My son had to get used to it.  I also had to watch for dehydration and monitor if he did not drink....Good luck...|`|vGpawdUCaa	I have an almost 5 month old who is breastfed and goes about once a week. We do bicycle motions with his legs, and then we press his knees to his stomach. This works even faster when you see them struggling to get it out.|`|rDGDk1SXaa	my 1 month old had a case of the same thing and we did the light karo and it was just a drop not even a 1/8 teaspoon in her bottles and she is fine now we did it for 1 week if that, we have recently found that a 1/8 teaspoon of stage 1 prunes to 4oz water,can do the trick to if it is a1 day event if it last longer I just watch very closely how much formula I am putting in her bottles its 1 non packed scoop so even if it's below the top of the scoop it is fine she will get the nutrition she needs.
aMcYK663aa	The line down the middle of your tummy is called linea negra.  It will disappear a while after you have your baby.  It is completely normal, nothing is wrong.  Some women get it, some don't.  I had it for both of my pregnancies.    Don't worry about showing already - everyone is different.  Hang in there with the morning sickness.  Eat when you can stand it.  If you are craving a bacon cheeseburger - go and get it.  I remember for a while there, I could only eat apples, icees and potato soup.  It will pass eventually - just remember that.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	The line is totally normal. It's caused by hormones. You may have a tilted uterus and that's why you are showing so soon. It's not anything life threatening to you or the baby. You'll just look bigger. Just tell your concerns to your doctor and he'll be able to help you.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	It is normal to have a small belly this early.  It's the bloating, uterus is the size of a grapefruit right now, plus your organs shifting together.  What your showing isn't baby, baby is the size of a grain of rice right now.

She was fine and so was her baby.|`|snAtqVG9aa	i had to have my apendix takin out at 6 weeks pregnant with my daughter. she turned out just fine. if you are worried talk to your ob about it.|`|QvmHjhdsaa	When I was 19 weeks I had to have major abdominal surgery to remove a cyst. I was put completely out and was on TONS of pain meds both before and after the surgery. I think my dr's were more concerned not because I was being put under but because it was abdominal surgery (I had to have a cantelope sized ovarian cyst removed) So the location was MUCH closer to the uterus. I came through the surgery just fine as did the baby. I am 37 weeks pregnant now and set to have my c-section on 2/10. If you are concerned about the anesthesia just talk to the dr and the anestheiologist before hand. They should be able to alleviate your concerns.    Good luck
giKCTfnfaa	it gets pushed upwards a little. towards the end of pregnancy, it usually causes some stomach discomfort.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It is above the uterus off to the left side of your body.  It gets squished a little during pregnancy.|`|dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	From what I remember, It goes UP.  There was a poster in Lamaze class that showed all the organs through out the trimesters.

I'm pretty sure that's PROOF that God has a sense of humor.  that and the proportionate bladder capacity.....  lol|`|o9u4H6m6aa	It's squished above the uterus. Because it's squished, Moms need to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large meals.
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	If you are on a 28 day cycle two weeks before your period would be about the time you ovulated. Many women will get PMS symptoms around the time they ovulate. This is brought on by an increase of hormones. Many women don't experience sore breast from pregnancy until a week or more after the egg implants. After ovulation it takes 5-10 days for the egg to implant, and then about another week before you really start feeling symptoms. Some women have symptoms early, however that usually doesn't start until they are close to their period. You are going to have to wait it out and see. I would suggest checking a ovulation calendar website to see when you are expected to ovulate.  I suggest www.babyhopes.com.  This one has worked for me and been very useful.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	yes u can be pregnant if u've never had that symptom before|`|SBj7fhNvaa	It could be both my breast are usually tender when I pms but alot of my friends who have been preggers said their breast hurt worse than they ever have so really its kinda up in the air!
vZuzT3cTaa	ok my second pregnancy was very unexpected. i took about 17 tests, and they were all negative, them i went to the doctor and got a blood test and i was pregnant. sometimes you have to have the blood tests because its more efficient. also if you pee on a stick in the morning, your hormones are more stronger. so buy a test, then wait till the morning, or go to the doctors. also you could just be stressed out and thats why you didnt start. it happens alot to women.|`|AfSwDFRcaa	Try taking one in like 2 more days...   Or getting some blood tests at the doctors, only problem with that is that it is a even longer wait.  If you have been stressed lately it could be that your just late.

Ka52nbhNaa	It depends on what you mean by "have" - if you asked my husband if he has children, he would say yes . . . they are involved in the conception of the baby.    But they cannot physically carry and give birth to a baby as they do not have a uterus.

I dyed my hair by myself in the 3rd trimester.|`|TDOfjYGBaa	Yup, if you're past the first tri, which you are. just make sure you're not breathing anything in.|`|UaL28atDaa	Its perfectly safe for the baby, however maybe not for your hair color! The hormones make your hair react differntly to the dye. This video will explain a lot better!    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...    Good Luck!!
K5TrkUhCaa	No, they can only give you an estimate.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	No. But you can guess if you remember what days you had sex.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No, but they can give you about a week timeframe.|`|zATQaiwIaa	They can give you a pretty good guess - but every womans body ovulates differently...so its more a educated guess|`|KNxs4PrZaa	no but pretty close, based on your last period and if you get an early ultraound to see how far along you are.  They told me i most likely conceived on the 16th of august and they were dead on, that was the only day we had sex! so unless you had tons and tons of sex with lots of guys and dont know when your last period was you should be able to get pretty close to the exact day.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Nope just an estimation!|`|F8m04KSoaa	No they can get it to the week but it's not fool proof so if you were with two guys in the same week...uh oh!
0sJsTN83aa	TV makes this look so easy, I remember the Friends finale had a giant theme of "we just adopted twins!"  And from a young age we're given little twins and triplet dolls that make having multiples seem like a fun toy.    In reality, twins are pretty rare.  Now, trying to find a woman pregnant with twins that she's putting up for adoption - one in a million cases.      Now, if you want an older set of twins, that is far more likely.  But please ask yourself, why twins?  One child is very difficult, now imagine one baby finally going to sleep just in time for another to wake up screaming!    My close friend had triplets five months ago and had to quit her job and hire a nanny just to keep up.  My father and my cousins are twins as well, so trust me, it's not a something to go into because it looks super cute.      I would strongly suggest that if you're interested in more than one child at once, try to find a sibling set (ie, children related, but are often different ages).  There are lots of siblings out there who don't have homes, and that would be a fairly easy goal to obtain.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	well if someone is giving them up but i think finding any new born is hard enough nevertheless finding twins...good luck though|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Is it possible for you to give birth to twins.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Is it possible? Yes  Is it probable? No    I don't mean to rain on your parade, but the chances of finding infant twins available for adoption is pretty low.  Infants are generally adopted domestically and there's fierce competition for the estimated 20,000 newborn infants placed for adoption each year in the US.  If you compare that to the hundreds of thousands of people looking to adopt, you can see where the probability is not good.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	I second BLW.  It is very unlikely.|`|Py1oiwYQaa	Yes, it is possible but the odds aren't good. You can say you're open to multiples, but I woudln't turn down any singles in the meantime. It is difficult to get selected in the first place, and you don't want to discourage any mom from choosing you to parent their child. The more situations you are open to the better your chances of finding a match.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Hey I'm a multiple Mom.  Hang on I'll just pop a couple out for ya    Rolls eyes|`|Fx77zYhWaa	yeah, but I don't think you can request twins with an agency and there's a long waiting list for newborns.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Well do you know of someone wanting to put twins up for adoption?|`|ZM6ztWAzaa	Do you want fries with your baby order too?

2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	My son started the jumperoo just after 4 months, he also had good head control. In the begining, just limit the time she is in it. Start with one or two minutes, then slowly increase the time. You don't want her to lose the neck control while jumping and cause whiplash.    Because you want to use it after eating (and jumping after eating is a recipe for spitting up in my experience)...  The other thing you can do is get a bouncer seat that is inclined. Or prop her up with pillows. You can also prop up her crib mattress.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	i would try the excersaucer first!!!! my son loved his excersaucer then went to his jolly jumper when he was older.....i had my son in one when he was quite yoing....surrounded by blankets......he was able to hold his head...but he liked it...u know hat she can handle ur the mom....|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I had my baby in it when she was 4months old!

23MPcnNqaa	A blood test.  The levels will be higher than a singleton pregnancy.  But other reasons may also cause your levels to be higher.  So it wouldn't be definite.    You may hear 2 heartbeats if you are having twins.  But at 3 months, Which was my first prenatal care visit, we only heard one heartbeat.  I didn't know I was having twin until into my 4th month when I had my ultrasound.    You have a higher chance of having twins if they run on your mother's side of the family.  It is the female that carries the gene.  So whether they run in your husbands family or not doesn't matter.    I would just try to be patient until your ultrasound visit.  Best of luck to you!!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If the doctor hears more then one heartbeat, that would let you know.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	You can request a hcg blood test and from this if you were carrying twins your hcg level reading will be higher that that expected from a mother carrying one baby at 9 weeks.|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	There's no SURE-FIRE way of telling if you're carrying multiples without an ultrasound, not even by testing hcg levels.    If you're short, that would explain your bump growing quicker than you expected.    Good luck!|`|S3t69kh2aa	Do you have fraternal twins on your side of the family?  Is this your first pregnancy?  If so, I would say very likely, yes.  Ask the doctor to check.  It can be easy to miss, I had three ultrasounds before the second baby showed up!  Good luck!
HRL4t9yraa	Did you have unprotected sex in October? Periods can be late because of stress, and if you just moved, you are probably stressed. If you used protection, and had a normal period in December, then your period may just be delayed due to stress. However, to be on the safe side, it would probably be a good idea to take a pregnancy test.|`|pvJAp3vIaa	If you're not having regular periods, you should always talk to a doctor.  A pregnancy test is cheap and easy to do.  As for not having any sexual interaction... do you mean none at all, or just no intercourse?  If a guy ejaculates outside, but near your vagina, it CAN get in.  It only takes one little swimmer to get the job done.  There are documented cases of "virgin" pregnancies where a woman has never had intercourse, but the man ejaculated outside and it made its way up and in.  Not common, but not impossible.    As for irregularity.... again, see a doctor.  Its possible you had a period but were pregnant.  Whatever the case, you probably want to check with a doc and make sure you're in good health.|`|KSf9t0Vnaa	just take a test it is the easiest way to find out for sure good luck. hope my advice helped.
23MPcnNqaa	Like you said, there is always a chance.  But I wouldn't base it on your belly getting big earlier in the pregnancy.    When I was pregnant with my twin boys, I didn't start showing until I was a little over 5 months.    Every pregnancy is different though.    Congratulations to you!!  I wish you a happy, healthy pregnancy.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I'm having my third, and the way my doctor put it is that by now your round ligaments are stretched from each pregnancy and don't really hold much up. You are definitely going to show sooner with each pregnancy.     Factors that might increase twinning are obesity, age 35 and older, whether you've had previous children, a family history and of course the use of fertility drugs.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	after you have children, you are more likely to start showing early.  and i highly doubt your having twins because of this, but you never know      and ps, i am just a lucky one that is having twins. im 21, twins don't run in my family, etc... so im lucky!|`|5RoYyprkaa	you start showing earlier with each pregnancy.  with a family friend, she didn't show until 20 weeks, then for every baby thereafter, she showed earlier and earlier. she's know on baby number 6 and she showed at 9 weeks.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Just because you didn't show until 12 weeks with your other 2 doesn't mean it will be the same with this one. You will just have to wait and see if you are carrying twins. Do twins run in your family? Were you on fertility drugs?|`|Qn5mn99vaa	You show earlier with each pregnancy. However, when I was pregnant with my twins I had a small but noticeable bump at 6 weeks. When I first asked my doc if that was normal (it was my second pregnancy) she said it was. Then she took a look at me and was a little suspicious, checked the size of my uterus and sent me for an u/s. Sure enough, there was two in there and I carried HUGE throughout my pregnancy, looked a few months further along than I was the entire time.  You could maybe just also have some bloating? Either way, good luck!|`|1KppBoKnaa	theres always the chance. but the more your pregnant the3 sooner you show.
jiwTWNNtaa	Pregnant sex is the best, no worry about birth control! As long as the doctor doesn't say not to have sex, it's OK up to the end.    Possible concerns:  1. If pre-term labor is a risk, orgasm might be a risk  2. If the water has broken, infection is a risk  3. If Dad hasn't finished any meds that were prescibed for std's (STDs are very bad for babies, so don't have sex with any other partner. Some STDs cause blindness to the baby).|`|jfwmelYgaa	No it's fine up to the 3rd trimester....so it won't induce labour...|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The only complications that can arise are if the partner has an STD (bad for fetus and mom), or if the mom has an incompetent cervix (premature labor) - otherwise there is no reason to stop for most healthy moms.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Sex during pregnancy is perfectly fine.  The only time to not have it is if the doctor specifically tells the woman not to.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Yes, but I would avoid the (simulated) rape fantasy.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	No in fact my midwife told me to have sex and let my husband ejaculate inside me to help prepare my cervix for birthing.  Some women have contractions from sex, and sometimes just from the sperm and in that case you would tell your doctor.|`|bvWgHr5Qaa	it's fine, have at it!|`|o9u4H6m6aa	Yes! Of course you can!!!  No, there are no complications that could happen!|`|U60L7qNEaa	well besides the baby being poked with your dick, no there are no complications    some women actually report being hornier while being pregnant|`|giRRCXU4aa	In a normal pregnancy, sex is safe and healthy. It can't do anything to the baby or the mother. If the doctor thinks something is wrong or your pregnancy is high-risk, they may ask you to refrain from having sex.|`|xmKBjEfIaa	its fine! go get some! haha|`|DeRRNCvnaa	Having Sex while you are pregnant is said to Induce Labor. That's all I know of.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	its perfectly fine as long as your doctor hasn't told you not to.  the only time it is not ok is if you are having complications during the pregnancy that might be worsened by sex, but in a healthy pregnancy got for it!|`|8vV145Peaa	If the pregnancy is not high-risk than yes sex is fine but there are restrictions. if the male is on top it limits or can totally cut off circulation to your lower body and the baby. also he should not put his full body weight on your abdominal section during the first trimester. if your pregnancy is high-risk than you should ask a doctor for the most accurate results. there are websites you could look at.|`|rnZoebKQaa	thats why God give women an anus....|`|XmhYNlumaa	it will be alright no harm will be done

DDYwnut6aa	Well, it's a bit of both.  While you can't choose a sperm that will produce a healthy child, you can maximize your chances of having healthy sperm.  You don't want to abstain for too long, you are correct.  Don't wait a week between ejaculations.  However, every day is fine for men with no sperm count issues.  If there is a low sperm count, you will want to go for every other day.  It takes a normal healthy male about 24 hours to replenish the sperm supply.    Good luck!    Phillippe, you are speaking of a fertility test.  They want older sperm as well as newer in the test, thus the abstinence for 3 days.|`|mFZGIPcWaa	You have it wrong, the longer your sperm is it your testicles the better. If you jerk off daily you bring your sperm count level down which makes it harder to concieve. Have sex every other day and not every day. Takes just one sperm out of 300 million to get 1 single egg pregnant. Good Luck,    I was saying that in a hypolitical way, just in case you do and did not mention.    And this is too Phillipe, you are so wrong, you should go read up on how to concieve and right there written from the experts states "having sex every other day" increases you chances of pregnancy more. Its not a mathematical question either, so you should go get more knowledge on this aspect.|`|AA10027086	unfortunately there is no sperm that will produce a healthy baby:-(    if you have sex with your wife every day the chances of her getting pregnant will be lower. the reason is that your sperm count decreases that much more often. ideally you should have sex EVERY OTHER day during the week your wife is due to ovulate. sperm can live in her for about 48 hours. i don't know how much you both have read into the fertility signs, but the one where you can help is by noting her cervical mucus. i know sounds gross, but when a woman ovulates her mucus down there gets thicker, almost egg white consistancy to help the sperm swim easier. if you notice she seems more "wet" than usual while having sex and she thinks she may be ovulating that is prime baby making time...good luck to you both!!!|`|MH9w47FCaa	I do not agree with Chels that sperm takes 24 hours to replenish... for exemple... many sperm banks request 3 days of production... it is more replenished after 3 days...    I do not agree with Kitcat's maths: of course lower sperm count descrease probability, but if you give every day instead of every 2 days, your overall sperm count will not be lower!    Your sperms are not swiming out of your body but in the orgasm, there is a muscle at work and this is very much the same for woman, it is why the cervical fluid becomes like it is to grab the sperms and carry them... so my advice, is that the guy should have his orgasm first and then go on giving one to his wife...
NYBo35zjaa	Yogurt, plain place directly on the area, add some to your water when you wash.

You do look pregnant in this picture.   I didn't actually look pregnant at 18 weeks  - I just looked like I was gained weight as opposed to carrying a baby.|`|tb0NMaooaa	awww baby bump!   I think your fine! your a tiny tiny girl! If your really worried, ask your doctor on your next check up.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	i honestly think u look fine|`|CptGRMSlaa	I looked and measured small my whole pregancy.  When I was a week late, they went to induce me and I measured 8 weeks behind.  They debated, but after much insistance on my part they did induce me, insisting the baby would be tiny.  She was 8lbs 14 oz!  Don't worry, you look like you have a small frame, so you are going to look small compared to larger women.  Oh BTW I did not even show at 18 wks with my first.  He was over 9 lbs.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	You look fine. When you have your ultrasounds they will tell you if your baby is small or not. Just because you don't stick out far doesn't mean anything. It could just be the way the baby is laying. Also your slim built your not gonna stick out really far until your farther along.|`|1cRANJXNaa	girl my stomach don't even stick out as much as u an i'm 21wks along its still flat an an only sticks out if im laying down. so i wouldn't worry cuz my lil one kicks all the time an seems just fine to me.|`|ac5r2V1maa	Your bump is fine because you are thin person. Everyone shows their pregnancy different. An acquaintance of mine who is very thin showed her bump at  months.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I was very tiny and was measuring only the size of 3 months along when I delivered at 34 weeks. I wouldn't worry too much at the moment. You may just be tiny your whole pregnancy or you may just grow overnight or pop out at the last minute. Just keep up with your doctor appintments.|`|afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	You look like you are "skinny" like me. At 18 weeks I had a bump but it wasn't big. Then it was like over night I had this bump that looked like I swallowed a ball. Right now I'm 24 almost 25 weeks and people who don't know me really well say "Oh you're not very big for being 6 months" but the people that see me all the time say Look at how big you are getting. Also its much more noticeable depending on the type of shirts you wear. I usually wear t-shirts and sweatshirts but lately they don't fit so Ive had to wear the maternity shirts Ive inherited and you can really tell now. Just hang in there and don't worry every one gains differently. In the first 20 weeks I gained maybe 5 lbs total and I have gain that much if not more in the last month. Good luck|`|xIKo5zA5aa	dont worry, i didnt start growing til 19 weeks !!!     Good Luck and Congrats!|`|pvJAp3vIaa	Some women don't show much, or at all, for a while.  A friend of mine, a really tiny girl (5'2 and 105 lbs before she got pregnant), didn't show noticeably until she was about 4 or 5 months in.  If you're at all worried, talk to your doctor.  Odds are, though, that you're fine.|`|phAqOpzZaa	You look cute tiny!!! i hope i turn up this way!|`|vhuqAqNdaa	Holy moly, i bet you still fit into your nomal clothes!!  dont worry size of bump dosent indicate size of baby whatsoever! You have a tiny frame to begin with.|`|ooaT4uGraa	I think you're fine. As long as you're eating healthy and your doctor says everything is fine, then you don't need to worry. I didn't show until I was 7 months along, and I had a 7lb 11oz baby.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Your baby is still very small, barely coming out of the pelvis. You are the perfect size for your pregnancy. Don't worry because your belly will grow enough later on and you'll be wishing it'd stop. Keep rubbing that stretchmark cream in.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	You are tiny.  But, you were tiny to begin with I am guessing.  I would not worry.  Your doctor would have said something before and I am sure you will ask at next appointment.  Try not to worry or stress.  You could call adn try to get in the appointment a bit earlier if you are really worried.|`|DNygQdmVaa	its a small bunp but your small girl.  Soon enough youll pop out there don worry!|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	No, your fine. Being a first pregnancy you usually take a while to show as the stomach muscles are still tight. Smaller frame people also take a bit longer to get a "bump."  When you are 8 - 9 months, you will be wishing you were small again, believe me!  Lots of luck.
AA11973712	Not spanking nearly enough.   Spanking should be the first line of discipline until the child is ready to move out.

fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	i would try just pumping for a while he is obviously not latching on to you properly.  use lanolin cream until it heals a bit and then try again if the problem still happens i would talk to a lactation specialist they are at the hospital where you delivered.... heres a website for the right latch on technic|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	You can get it to heal quickly if you follow these steps:        *  Breastfeed from the uninjured (or less injured) side first. Baby will tend to nurse more gently on the second side offered.      * The initial latch-on tends to hurt the worst - a brief application of ice right before latching can help to numb the area.      * Experiment with different breastfeeding positions to determine which is most comfortable.      * If breastfeeding is too painful, it is very important to express milk from the injured side to reduce the risk of mastitis and to maintain supply. If pumping is too painful, try hand expression.      *  After breastfeeding, soak nipple(s) in a small bowl of warm saline solution for a minute or so--long enough for the saline to get onto all areas of the nipple. Alternately, put the saline solution into a squeeze bottle and squirt it on gently; use plenty of saline, making sure to get it on all areas of broken skin.      * Avoid prolonged soaking (more than 5-10 minutes) that "super" hydrates the skin, as this can promote cracking and delay healing.      * Pat dry very gently with a soft paper towel.      * If baby objects to the taste of the residual salt from the saline rinse, rinse directly before nursing by dipping nipple(s) into a bowl of plain water. Pat dry gently.  After the salt water rinse        * Apply expressed breastmilk to the nipples to promote healing--this can be done in addition to other treatments.      * To promote "moist wound healing" (this refers to maintaining the internal moisture of the skin, not keeping the exterior of the skin wet) apply a medical grade lanolin ointment (e.g., Lansinoh, Purelan), soft paraffin/vaseline PDF or a hydrogel dressing (e.g., ComfortGel, Soothies).      * If you have thrush, follow the saline soak with an antifungal ointment or other thrush treatment.      * If needed, apply an antibiotic ointment (e.g. Bactroban/mupirocin, Polysporin)   Between nursings        * Keep nipples exposed to air when possible. When wearing a bra, use fresh disposable pads (change when damp). Some mothers use breast shells to protect the nipple from the dampness and friction of the bra.      * If there is a specific injury--like a bite--cold compresses (ice packs over a layer of cloth) may help: 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off; repeat as needed.      * Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) is compatible with breastfeeding.      * Once a day, use a non-antibacterial, non-perfumed soap to gently clean the wounded area, then rinse well under running water. Using soap on the nipple area is not recommended unless the skin is broken.|`|9vz1bsFzaa	Keep it moist all the time with vaseline or moisturizing cream specific for that purpose.

I just nursed my son on my left breast until the right healed.  I would hand express milk out of my right breast because it was too sore to pump.  I used nothing on my sore nipple but the breast milk I expressed. I would gently rub it around my nipple and let air dry.  My breast eventually healed and all the pain was gone.  Yours will too.

The shield went right over my nipple and protected it till it was better.  You can buy a nipple shield at any baby store and they only cost about 5 bucks. It will really help! Good luck and don't give up, remember you are doing what is best for your baby!!!|`|xMNpzFzGaa	Try a nipple shield. It has worked for others, but sadly not for me. My son got weirded out by the shield. I continued to breastfeed though painful. Kept it clean and used some lanolin and it healed on its own.|`|S3DFPmjaaa	DON'T GIVE UP!  Breast is best.  It's not always easy, but it's worth it for you baby's sake.  You do need to be careful because a wound like this could lead to mastitis.  Can you get to a pharmacy?  They may have someone who can help but if they don't, look at what they have in the way of nipple creams, nipple shields etc.    I don't know where you are but many countries have breastfeeding support organisations such as the ABA (Australian Breastfeeding Association) and Le Leche League (in the US) who have phone &/or online counsellors who can give advice for free.    Hang in there and good luck.  You really are doing the best for your baby :)
ieusQoDRaa	First, your actions are very important.  If you are getting good grades, staying out of trouble, that helps.  Anything less, she's not gonna trust you.  I'm not sure how old you are, but if you are younger than 16, and having a bf/gf, probably also doesn't help the trust.    Also, communication is important.  Start small.  Ask very nicely, politely, if you can go to the movies, say who is going, what time, what movie, when you'll come home, like that, and see how she reacts.  If you are asking to go out, and its during the day for example on a weekend, and she says no, ask why?  (obviously, if its really late at night, or an R rated movie, or other guys there, she has reason to say no, even if overprotected).  Ask her why she doesn't let you go very nicely and politely, w/o getting mad, and be reasonable, explain that you are careful, a good kid, that you dont' want to do anything bad, and maybe slowly she'll change and warm up to the idea.  It will take time though.|`|d5K8wORqaa	talk to her|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, if you were complaining about things that actually mattered to real life and weren't just whining about how you aren't allowed to text in church or something, I'd be more willing to help you.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	she surely doesnt hate u but  u could slightly confront her so therell be a point when u explode n ull be a rebel n ulll do wat u want haha|`|x0Ftr35Laa	That sucks. My mom was the same way. I finally moved out of her house when I was a junior in high school. I couldn't stand her. I have 2 kids now and I definitely don't want to be a parent like she is.|`|brvOa9QYaa	she sounds like she loves u too much aha  she certainly dont sound like she hates u  u just need to explain that u need more freedom.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	Well, if you never lost and never had it how would you know how to gain it?    Warning: Do not follow this theory if you won't follow through with it!!!  Or else your mom will really get to you!!!!!!!!!!!    Be rebellious (nothing major like sneaking out)  Use your minutes and if she has something to say you respond by simply saying "why did you get me unlimited minutes anyway thats a no brainer, I surely won't be on it with you all day!"    If she wants to pubish you by taking your phone after your little back talk you throw the phone and run in your room and slam the door.    If you want to go out with your friends to the movies and she says no you scream to the top of your lungs and say ("OMG! you never let me do anything I AM getting older and mature and unlike you I have my youth and want to hang out.") RUn in your room again)    Repeat these episodes until she ask whats wrong with you,  How did you get this way  (with a soft tone) you explain to her that you are getting older and you need her full trust and respect in order to enjoy your teenager years,  Tell her that you never felt that she loved you the way a mother should love her child, and she's only loving you because she HAS to, and not because she WANT to...(and whatever else you have on your mind)    She'll eventually break down and relize how she's acting...and you'll get trust and respect|`|dt8UrgaVaa	Do things around the house without her asking you to do them first. Ask if theres anything she needs done. If worse some to worst stay in your room and act depressed for a weekend or two. Thats what my brother does and then my mom lets him go everywhere because she feels bad for him. It takes a lot of time to gain trust from a parent. Just be patient and don't get into any trouble!
S4z7mefcaa	Walmart has pretty good prices.  Make sure you buy a new one.  Used ones are risky and they may have expired and no longer be safe.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	There are decent ones at discount stores for $50 (walmart, target, k-mart). check freecycle.org or craigslist for a used one.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Big Lots ( if in your area) you can sometimes get them for about $40. Otherwise if you don't mind used, check out your local consignment shops or church sales. Also you can go to Craigslist.org|`|w7FSmSTnaa	depends on what you mean by cheap. The cheapest you will prob find is going to be around 100.00. check babies r us they have one made by graco pediacomfert. ive been using it for about 4 months and love it|`|FLEXqVoiaa	A good one is the Cosco Scenera . We bought one of these seats for both of our kids to use in my parent's car, and another set for my husband's car. It's easy to install and there are a few different styles to choose from. I believe they're sold everywhere-Target, Wal Mart, Babies R Us, etc.    At Target, the seat sells for right around $50|`|TDOfjYGBaa	www.craigslist.com has a lot of good and cheap things people are trying to sell.|`|xMNpzFzGaa	Big Lots and WalMart. Watch out for coupons for BabiesRUs too. Always buy brand new. Used ones might have been from accidents or recalled models.|`|nrGsxWw3aa	Kmart, Walmart or Target.  Remember Walmart will price match.|`|tnKhIUK1aa	Check under Craig's List on the computer in your city first... They have great deals.  It is worth the search...|`|4QTaOm8qaa	i saw some at burlington coat factory in the baby depot for about 50 to 100 dollars. i wouldn't buy one from a consignment shop because you don't know if it was involved in a car accident.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	We just got a Graco from Wal-Mart, it was $80 and seems nice so far.|`|YVBXMghXaa	Do not give into the temptation to save money buying a used carseat.  You do not know the history of the seat and it can be deadly to your child if it has been in an accident.  When thinking about saving money on a carseat, you also need to think about the longevity of it.  If you buy an inexpensive seat and then end up having to buy another one when your child outgrows it, you are not really saving any money in the longrun.  You are better off spending a little bit more money now to make sure that your child is as safe as possible for as long as possible.    My best reccomendation for a forward facing only seat is the Graco Nautilus, which sells for about 150.  Most seats harness to 40 pounds, but often outgrow the height restrictions before the weight.  40 pounds is the absolute minimum to move to a belt positioning booster, although it is safest to keep them harnessed as long as possible.  If your child reaches the height before the weight, you are going to end up buying another harnessing seat anyway before the booster.  The Nautilus harnesses to 60 pounds and then can be changed into a booster when the time comes.  I don't recall the height restrictions off hand, but it should last most kids close to the 60 pound mark.  Once your child is forward facing, this will be the last seat you will have to buy.  Remember that for a forward facing seat, the harness straps should come out at or slightly above the child's shoulders.  If their shoulders are taller than the top slot, your child has outgrown the seat.  Good luck!
BRHANhYwaa	The only pain I can think that it could possibly be is round ligament pain, basically all your muscles and ligaments around your belly and pelvic area expanding. If you are not sure you should always ask your doc to be on the safe side.|`|uiRdhx3saa	i had this and still do occasionally. i was really worried, but my doctor said it was round ligament pain, kind of like growing pains during pregnancy. its normal.|`|BKCwQn2Eaa	this began for me at 15 weeks im now 19 weeks and im still experiencing it the doctor checked me and told me that it is round ligament pain ... if your really worried go see your doctor i call mine all the time ... good luck and congrats
WwCBomTMaa	First of all there is no story to go with this like usual. Did you actually have sex? Hun, if the answer is yes then you need to talk to your mother. Even if you aren't pregnant your mother might be able to figure out why her 13 year old daughter is having sex. And put a stop to it.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	They sell home pregnancy tests at the dollar store.   Tell your mom, she needs to know and teach you some things she may have thought you already knew about sex and pregnancy.|`|HZbSbZIraa	the only way to know is to take a test and or see your doctor ! have you missed your period ? that would be the first sign !|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Sweetie, you're going to have to tell your parents.  If you are pregnant, you're not going to be able to hide it very long.  If you are not pregnant, but are having sex, you need to see a doctor for birth control.  If you are not having sex, you aren't pregnant and you need your parents to explain the facts of life.|`|PAwqjxvaaa	take a hpt, but if you're not ready, you're much too young, and not financially ready to have a baby....think of abortion, or try to have a miscarriage, I know that sounds crazy, but ****, i wasn't even thinking about sex when i was 13....you gotta live your life to the fullest, graduate high-school and fall in love with the man that wants to be with you your whole life.....having a kid now is basically going to ruin you.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	goodness..well you & your boyfriend need to try to find a clinic in a nearby city, and please talk to your family.|`|eemmWU0Haa	a test...you have no choice ask your mom too take you, butt umm you might wanna tell her that you might be pregnant first.|`|3VR3u22Laa	If u miss ur period.|`|phAqOpzZaa	ask the guy you slept w/to help you get a prego test...and hun i pray your not...your 13 and still need to live your life!|`|kOcYkte7aa	I recommend you tell your mom and ask her to take you to buy a pregnancy test.have you missed you period?missing your period is usually a first sign of pregnancy.Best wishes.
Ka52nbhNaa	No, she is not pregnant . . . sperm is pretty resilient but they cannot swim through jeans and into her to find the egg.    If she was undressed, it would be a different story.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	if the *** is on her pants, then no she's not pregnant.  if she wasn't wearing anything, then theres a possibility|`|PLK1p8cUaa	If he ejaculates in or near the vaginal opening without a barrier there is a chance of getting pregnant.|`|wMZhw6STaa	yea|`|mFZGIPcWaa	on her jeans? There is a barrier there. No way to get pregnant is there was just semen on the jeans. The dreams she's having. It's because she is thinking of it too much. Kids shouldn't be having babies or sex unless you know what really makes a baby and how.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Sometimes, I think that girls are so desperate to get pregnant that they are hoping for the answer to one of these stupid questions to be "yes". Why is that? The answer is no, hun, and I have a suggestion.......go back to sex ed.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	If it was only on her jeans then no.. But if he got any inside of her then yes.. If that is the case and you dont want to be pregnant then you need to be a little more careful.. Good Luck!|`|eemmWU0Haa	ahh did it actually go in???...we need more info there kiddo|`|gX40pgLyaa	as long as it didnt go in|`|Zy5TyS8gaa	It is possible, only if it went in somehow. It's not really probable though. If she's SO worried though, she can take a pregnancy test but she's probably over-worrying.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	are her jeans connected to her fallopian tubes?|`|WcvsBgLuaa	Prolly not.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If she still had her jeans on, it's not likely.  If they were zipped, no way.  She needs to see a doctor for birth control SOON or she will be pregnant.|`|a6An96Araa	If she had pants on, plus underwear, there is absolutely no way she is pregnant.  Sperm cannot make it through 2 layers of clothing, AND up the vagina just by that.  He would have had to ejaculate inside, or near her naked vagina.|`|gs3pJCRQaa	Okay I am little confused did they have sex? If not no she can not get pregnant sperm dies when it hits the air. relax|`|feZy6AMhaa	If any got on her skin near her vag theres a problem but if there is clothing in between she should be fine.|`|3VR3u22Laa	No|`|9Q2jwVSTaa	no way not gonna happen
SBj7fhNvaa	I feel your pain it never feels like a good time and theres always something going on.... But my Mom gave me the best advice if you wait until everythings perfect you will never have a baby theres never going to be "enough" money and theres never going to be the "perfect time." you have to do it when your ready so go for it..(but a note from a recent bride I would wait to try until after the wedding i'm sure you have a beautful dress you want to fit in)  Congrats on your wedding have a blast and good luck with everything else!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	From my experience there is no really good or bad time for a baby.  It's more important that you handle parenting well no matter when the baby comes.  Mind you, I got knocked up when I was almost 40 and thought I had female problems!  The first doctor I saw when that happened assured me that every woman works it out somehow.  Now I'm looking forward to being an "older" Mom.      In your case, if your "baby itch" gets scratched now, your anxiety medication might be changed or discontinued in favor of other therapy, and it might mean you and your fiance postpone your goals.  If you have a baby a few years from now, you might be dealing with different issues, but it will still be a big change in your life.|`|1yWBRCKSaa	well, if i were u,,,  i wiould wait aleast 2years until u would and a baby|`|gs3pJCRQaa	My husband and I have been married for 7mnths and we are trying for our first now. If you both are ready than go for it. Good luck with everything
J6vd8Gsbaa	Birth ive had both done ...really its birth with geting shot it is one place that hurts with birth your whole body feels like is is being torn apart|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Depends on where you get shot. At least during labor the pain only comes every 2 minutes and lasts 45 seconds. If you get shot or stabbed the pain is constant.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	well i've had a child, and i've been shot in the back of the leg with a 22, and to tell you the truth, i think getting shot hurts worse. but most women would tell you that i'm full of ****|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Nobody can answer this unless they've had a baby and been shot...not likely.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Ive never been shot but I have been stabbed and I tell you the pain form being stabbed was 100 times worse than having a vaginal delivery with no epi!!!|`|PLK1p8cUaa	Child birth no comparison.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Giving birth. When you get shot you're either dead, or you go numb with shock.|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	Lol thats a pretty funny question im sure they are both very painful and well getting shot would depend where and giving birth you are being stretched open from the inside so I dont know but both seem pretty painful to me|`|eemmWU0Haa	I'd rather have like 12 babies all vaginally then get shot, birth sounds much better & plus you get a real cute bundle of joy at the end every time too!...haha|`|hBMn6U4Xaa	getting shot|`|SOWJoNLuaa	Well I have never had a baby, obviously, but I can tell you getting shot hurts about as bad or worse than any pain I have ever had.   It is a deep throbbing pain that just continues.|`|4mgxl9r2aa	Getting shot, because after you got shot, you might possibly live, and its really painful.|`|fHgbL046aa	I'm not sure because I never been shot. I guess it all depends were I got shot. I tell you the whole having a baby hurts like a mother f-e-r-. That much I do know.|`|DgTZc7UQaa	having a baby, you go in labor for 40 hours and then getting shot wont seem half bad
7Vd3DfYzaa	If you have had your period then you should only grow a couple more one or two inches in the year after that. I am tall to and I just wonder when the guys will start being taller...lol|`|KbPrPuvhaa	your so lucky. why would you want to be taller? ur the perfect height.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I was that tall when I was 14. I stopped growing at about 17 and I am 5'10''. I am 26 yrs old.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Look around at the rest of your family.|`|gILygKvRaa	probably not much taller|`|DN9RZHi3aa	you might get a little taller like a few inches, but not to much|`|M4n6cj1paa	do modeling u got the height!  ;D    but probably just another 2-3 inches|`|f4be7a05ca90909db785dc60c0dfdb16aa	well usually u see how tall ur family is  but otherwise u problably grew earlier  either someone grows early and doesnt grow later on  and then others grow slowly throught the years
rAkWoweOaa	I am WAY more tolerant. Except before I had him, I couldn't stand it when babies cried in restaurants, but now I understand, and I get mad when people get mad because my baby is crying, lol.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Oh yes..I am way more patient then I have ever been, well not with hubby at times but he is a whole other story ;) :P. I do tolerate a lot more. I came to realize that it is not just about me or my husband anymore, we have this little human that we created and needs us for everything, and I can not let her down at all. Well at least until she hits her teens, then we'll talk. lol|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I'm actually a lot more mellow - my priorities have changed, so things that were a big deal before aren't so big now.    I also find that I'm much more interested in babies and kids around me.  I used to make a face and say "oh, uh, no thanks," when people made me hold their babies, and I'd keep my distance from anyone under 3 feet.  Now, though, I smile and wave and want to know about all them.  Crazy.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea a lil bit, i am def. alot happier than i was born, i was always a happy person, but now that Max is here if i feel down all i hafta do it look at him and i feel better, so that's just awesome, :D.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I feel happy and more fulfilled than I did before I had my son.

Im more mature, nurturing, and I believe strict on myself.|`|eD0MVJxUaa	I have definitely had to learn more patience.  I'm also able to go on less sleep, deal with messes, noisiness and mean people better.  It has made me grow so much so fast!!

It's been great.|`|202ff5e36fd233f7e4e10b9bde6c914daa	OMG I was almost where you are.. unfortunatly I satyed stressed (daddy issues...) lost all baby weight and then got PREGNANT AGAIN!!!!

Don't get me wrong I have always loved and respected my mom, but my senior year of high school she was so strict. I couldn't stand it. Now 8 years later not only am I finding myself totally agreeing with every rule and stipulation she put into effect, but thinking on certain things she was too lax!! I also find I'm totally content just staying home taking care of the house and playing with the kids all day. I am the happiest and most scared I've ever been in my entire life!!|`|qx4F2SJmaa	no-for me it was the complete opposite. I really became a nervous wreck.  I worried about every little thing.

I want to be a better person for my kids ya know? I'm picky about who I allow around my children, I think for most parents having a baby makes you grow up. Good for you! Enjoy him|`|GU3RauKOaa	I've become more assertive and agressive actually. I used to be a bit of a pushover and wouldn't say anything if someone in public was rude or mean to me. Now I stand up for myself maybe more than I should, lol.    I have also lost my shyness and have become more outgoing . I guess I realized there was no reason to be unsure of myself, that there are more important things than what others think of me.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	I am happy everytime I see my son. He just puts a smile on my face. I am so much happier now with my son and I am more patient also.
uQAZEzq2aa	When you go to the doctor towards the end of your pregnancy, he/she will check you to see how thin your cervix is and how dialated you are...while he/she is doing this he/she will sort of scrape away the mucus plug. I had it done twice while I was pregnant, at my 38 and 39 week check ups and after the 2nd time I went into labor with in an hour and my son was born the next morning. It is quite painful....in fact i remember it bringing tears to my eyes but its over fast and so worth it if it keeps you from going past your due date. Good Luck!!|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	When you reach your due date, your care provider may recommend a technique known as "sweeping" or "stripping" the membranes. This method has been long used by midwives and obstetricians as a way to start labor contractions. Several questions arise. How does stripping the membranes feel to the mother? What exactly does the process of stripping membranes involve? Does stripping the membranes start labor? And are there any risks to this procedure?    What is Sweeping the Membranes?  When your provider strips your membranes, this is done via a vaginal exam, typically very close to your due date. During the exam your provider will separate your amniotic sac from the cervix using his fingers.    You will typically feel some discomfort and it may feel like a longer and more painful vaginal exam than normal. It is not unusual to have some spotting for severals days after you have had your membranes stripped.    Does Stripping the Membranes Start Labor?  For years, providers used this technique routinely since they believed it would stimulate contractions. However new research published in the June 2008 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology does not bear this out. This research shows that stripping the membranes does not shorten the pregnancy or prevent a mother from going past her due date.    Are there any RIsks in Stripping the Membranes?  The same research study above has confirmed that if a mother's cervix is dilated 1cm or more then sweeping or stripping her membranes may increase the chances of breaking the bag of waters. Unintentionally breaking the mother's water can create a need to start labor and may include a host of other complications such as the need for pitocin, antibiotics if labor is prolonged and potentially a greater chance of a caesarean.    Questions to Ask  Some providers strip their patients' membranes routinely if the mother goes past her due date, so it is always a good idea to check with your provider prior to any vaginal exam to verify whether or not she is planning to perform this procedure. Remember that all medical procedures should be done with the mother's prior consent and knowledge.    Do you need to have labor started? If there are medical indications that require an induction of labor, either medically or naturally, be sure to talk with your provider about your options. In most cases, it is perfectly normal to pass your due date by a week or more before it is necessary to stimulate labor.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. I don't know. I have never heard of that. Good luck & Peace|`|n4eHbm6baa	it doesn't hurt as much as it is irritating. but it is a good thing to help get the ball rolling. the just use a little tool and scrape the cervix. if you do have to have it you'll be ok.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I had mine stripped with my first pregnancy. It is a little uncomfortable to get done, but no worse than a cervical exam. Basically the doctor just loosens up the amniotic sack off of the cervical area. My doctor calls it "stirring things up a bit". He just runs his finger around the circumfrence of the cervix. I went into labor the next day after having it done. So I don't regret it at all.|`|UDX7yqD2aa	Your OB/midwife will, for lack of a better word, "scrape" along your cervix in hopes of loosening your mucous plug.   It doesn't always work. I had my membranes stripped during two of my pregnancies. With my daughter I didn't go into labor for 2 more weeks. With my son it was 4 days later.  It's not painful, but it can be quite uncomfortable.   My suggestion would be to just wait it out and let your body go into labor on its own, but it is much less invasive than other methods used to encourage your body to go into labor.  Good luck!

GGH0HVdvaa	Right on Jennygirl!!|`|E7LSetRHaa	I am sorry but your parents shouldn't let her move in with you. You got her pregnant not them. It is hard enough providing for a family you made with out providing for a family someone else like a careless 16 year old made. If you want to live together get a job and buy your own place. You say her mom is acting selfish but are not you and your girlfriend the ones who made a baby with no plan to support it? And are not you and her the ones who expect someone else to provide for a baby you made? To me that sounds pretty selfish. How are you going to pay for the medical bills?|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	talk to them.....do they know she is preg, if not they will prob be shocked at first but will support you...explain the situation they will more then likely help..remember after the shock they will realise this isnt just your baby its their granbaby|`|DN9RZHi3aa	talk to them, or better yet write a letter  tell them how you feel, and that you feel responsible for taking action on your part for the baby that you created with her  theyve got to let her|`|sVV0VO6Jaa	in what were you thinking???  u and your girlfriend are facing a really big responsibility now...  but, im not here you give u a lecture...  your parents will understand...they will be obviously shocked but  they'll understand, parents love you no matter  what you do
23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Yes I carried to term (4 day past term to be exact) after having a miscarriage...    I didn't feel comfortable telling anyone until after 14 weeks (the gestation of my miscarriage) For me it was like a weird superstition (I knew I was being irrational but I couldn't shake it) if I made it past the 14 weeks without a problem it was ok to tell without jinxing it...    Not feeling comfortable and thinking you will some how jinx it by telling is quite common after a miscarriage...  You will likely relax when you pass the gestation time of your miscarriage until then it's ok to feel the way you do....|`|23fDrmZoaa	Most doctors will tell you that once you hit 12 weeks you are at the safe point. Although i have never had a miscarriage my friend did. With her second pregnancy she went a week  over due so it is deff possible that you will carry this baby to term|`|gq6omW7taa	I did miscarry early in my second pregnancy and I still got pregnant again and had that little girl.  I can't say that same thing will happen for you but sitting there worry yourself is going to just stress you out and that can also cause or help with the cause of the miscarriage.  Stay calm and think positive.|`|uiRdhx3saa	the best thing you can do is relax which i know is the hardest thing to do at this point. i miscarried on feb. 3, 2008 at 10 weeks, and learned i was pregnant again nov. 2, 2008. i am now 18 weeks pregnant. i couldn't even go to the bathroom. i was filled with so much anxiety to even look after i wiped, in fear that there would be blood. everything is going perfect. we go monday to find out the sex of our baby. i know i didn't exactly answer your question since i haven't even made it half way through my pregnancy, but it was reassuring to me to hear of pregnancies going well after miscarriage. best of luck.|`|dkX838qBaa	I had a miscarriage May 25 2008, I was 4 wks pregnant. I got pregnant again June 4th 2008...1 week later..My doctor was not happy, but I was thrilled..I am now 36 wks 3 days pregnant and and expecting a big healthy boy...My doctor said that people miscarry 30 percent of the time but they didnt even know they were pregnant in the first place..I am sure you will do fine..Once the doctor hears the heart beat around 8 or so wks you wont be so worried.After they hear the heart beat the chance of miscarrage drops big time..I have been where your at and the first few months are crazy you will be cheaking for blood every 5 min..But you'll be fine...Congrats and Good Luck|`|PkbPOWzsaa	i have 2 friends that had a miscarriage and after that they got pregnant in short time in 3 months and 4 months.now both they have beautiful baby girl 6 months and beautiful baby boy 12 days.so don't worry,enjoy it.i would wait though in spreading the news until 3 month of pregnancy.that is an unwritten law of pregnancy.good luck to you!|`|OBgqkkqlaa	You will be fine. I have 2 sisters and 2 cousins who all miscarried, and were pregnant again within two months. They all have healthy children. I miscarried in early November 2008, and now I'm eight weeks pregnant again. My doctor told me that sometimes when a woman gets pregnant for the first time, her body might not know what to do. This makes it a piece of cake the second time. Good Luck!|`|6lm66aHtaa	First of all relax. Miscarriage, while heart-breaking, is quite common. It does not always  mean something is wrong with you.   I miscarried twice, and my doctor said just happened that way. Nothing wrong.   I just had my baby a week ago and he was born 3 hours before his due date!   Just relax, that is the best advice I can give you. Sleep, take time for yourself and read pregnancy books. That all really helped me.   I didnt tell anyone until I was 12 weeks. just for the fact that they say it is less likely for a miscarriage after that time.   Good luck and dont stress!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Please, calm down. I cant tell you you will carry to term, I had a miscarriage at 5 weeks, which would have been my first pregnancy & I am now 7 weeks 2 days pregnant again. I believe most of first pregnancies end in miscarriage. There isn't anything wrong with you but most people say about the beginning of the 2nd trimester is when the miscarriage rates drop.  Good luck & best wishes.  p.s. stress is bad for the baby, so just relax & be happy you've been given a blessing|`|AA11763588	First, I'm sorry for your loss. A miscarriage at any week is a terrible loss.    I miscarried back in Aug and in Oct found out I was pregnant again. The first time my husband told everyone that had an ear that I was pregnant, this time around he waited till I was 12 weeks. Once you hit 12 weeks the chances drop dramatically.    I'm currently going on 21 weeks and everything looks great.    Try not to stress and think about having a miscarriage. Just stay positive, take your vitamins and drink plenty of water.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'm not pregnant right now but I'm sure in a few years when I have my first child things will work out. I had a miscarriage several years ago but I don't believe that is going to ruin my chances of having a healthy baby.    Good luck.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	it really has only been a month sense you have miscarried and they tell you to try and wait at least 3 months but if you stay calm and not stress out about it and feel like you can make it it will be better for you... keep your feet up dont do much and stay away from sex... im not crazy you really do alot of harm with sex if you have miscarried with all the movement and orgasms it doesnt make it easy for the baby|`|s8APstrVaa	I misscarried in Jan 2007 and was preg again by March.  I stressed about it the whole nine months.  Don't stress yourself out.  Everything happens for a reason.  Just keep your check ups with your doc and if you are feeling unsure, you can always go to the hospital.  They will monitor you and let you know what's going on with you baby.  Hope everything works out for you.
AA11021960	Ok, so I heard she is single... my question is - and I feel I have the right to ask since it is my tax dollars (as well as everyone elses) that are going to raise all these kids -   Why in the hell did that doctor even implant ANYTHING when she was single and had 6 prior kids!!!!???  I had to sign my life away promising that I was married, having sexual relations with ONLY my hubby just to get an IUD!!!  I am amazed that she was able to have this done at all. She already had children, she is single, where did the money come from to pay for this procedure....  I just don't understand how this all happened to begin with.  I hear that the doctor is under investigation by an ethics committee.  I half wonder if this was a 'can we do it' stunt.  There are so many reasons that in mainstream society it would have been stopped.  Beginning with the fact that she is single with 6 other children.  I think that the reason the doctor didn't advise against it was because he knew he would have his 15 minutes in the spotlight and I also wonder if she did this so she could move out of mommys.  Think of all the people who have multiples who get help from donations and other things.  The Duggars, there was also a family about 10 yrs ago or so that had 6 at once that got a lot donated to them.   There certainly is not any rational reasoning here, that is for sure.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Maybe she was trying for her own baseball team.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Yeah I saw that.  I heard she lives with her mom too.  That might just be a rumour though.    But yeah...what an idiot!|`|a1ymHaWAaa	well are you going to adopt them?|`|prqrQcd1aa	Do you know you are about the 100000 person today to talk about this??    Do you also know that back in the time of my grandparents and great grandparents it was common to have that many children.. though not in that manner!    I do not know, as i do not know the woman personally,nor am i a psychic who can see into the future.. these kids may be fine, they may have health problems, i don't know.... but with my grandfather who was the second oldest of 14 kids, i can say with great ease..yes... but once again, they were not born through IVF, it wasn't even around then lol.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	She lives with her mother people!!! She is crazy!|`|s2JvJ5alaa	She had octuplets, I think.  It was her decision to have so many children. Just because she has 14 children doesn't mean she stupid or ignorant.  Have you seen or heard of the Duggar family? They have 18 children. Most of which are extremely young and all live at home.  You can't judge someone like that just because you think it's wrong they have so many children.|`|c05bb431beac7ffe86bf43bdbf9897fcaa	It is a little odd that the doctor implanted 8 embryos, especially when she already had 6 kids. Who knows why she did it...|`|AA12364667	She is crazy. 14 kids with no hubsband and still living at home with mom. Its crazy.|`|mrrVtKGgaa	Yes, well maybe she thinks she could manage the family. Who knows.?|`|b5eSmOhiaa	She may be smart, and yes, I saw that on Yahoo!.  However, that is not a rumor.  She has no husband, though...I mean, think about the kids.  14 of them growing up without a dad, all under one parent.  Don't you think they would be a little hard to raise?  I don't have a problem with husband and wife having that many children, but in the article it said that this lady loves babies.  That may be so, but you have to think about the children's future.  Babies aren't an accessory, they are living breathing things that will become the future of the world.|`|qNf0A4V4aa	i thought she was crazy, until i found out she is a single parent. now i think she is a total idiot.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	I have 15 aunts and uncles on my mothers side of the family and her mom ended up being a single parent because her dad died when she was young.  The oldest is 20 years older than she is.  No life insurance or anything....Her family managed.  Lived in a 4 bedroom house and she worked as a nurse.  and no this was not back in the 1940s this was in the 70's      and her having 14 kids is not going to effect my tax dollars personally.  no one knows her finacial situation anf for a dr to implant that many embroys at once...Im sure there is an underlying study going on that we may not no about.  To get that procedure done period cost money...so apparently she has either the funding from somewhere to have that done or she has  money herself!!!    You do not need a husband to raise kids!!!|`|b934057de9d292e8af49c856f1338095aa	I think that this is ridiculous. She's only 33; did you know that? Plus she doesn't know who the father is. Which means more tax dollars feeding people who just are foolish.
KozoNqpsaa	Congrats on your decision! All 3 of my babies were conceived the old fashioned way...doing the BD on day 14. (The 14th day from day 1 of AF) Also, checking your CM for when it's slippery and clear - sorry, TMI. I have heard that EPT makes a good kit and I think they are all pretty close to the same price. Try a generic (store brand) version though...generic pain meds, cold meds, etc. all seem pretty effective; why not an ovulation kit, right?!    I too was pretty regular but they didn't all happen exactly when we wanted them too. Just remember, it takes time and patience; try not to stress too much and get all consumed with it. Just relax and enjoy all the "practice!" :)    ***Baby Dust!!!***|`|RrPjG9x9aa	I spent about 2 months buying opk's at Target, but I have irregular cycles, and they only come 7 in a box for around $12, so I was buying like 2 or 3 boxes a month.  Then I discovered that on ebay, you can buy them in bulk.  I bought 50 for $14.99, and they work great:)  (just type in "ovulation predictor" in the search bar).  Since you're regular, you may not need 50, but whether you go Target or Ebay, those are the cheapest I found.  Good luck!
FLEXqVoiaa	Haha I think if there's so many dumbas*** on Y!A I can only imagine how many clueless parents there are in the world.     My oldest sibling is 40-I asked my mom about whiskey on the gums, after seeing a question about it on here. She said even 40 years ago, no DR ever suggested that to her.    Also-I've had whiskey. I don't recall it ever numbing my mouth.|`|52bAHCaUaa	It was probably just trolls...I wouldn't take it personally.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	A little bit on the gums won't hurt the baby.  In fact my mom did that to me and my sisters when we were babies.  Not enough to make the baby drunk or sick, but enough to numb the gums sorta....but we were teething at the time.    I know a long time ago people used to mix a little whiskey in milk to help a baby sleep so if she only put it on the  babies gums, I don't consider that abuse at all.    And I'm sure I'll get some thumbs downs but oh well.|`|3klIx1Egaa	some people are set in there ways i guess, when some were raised they were taught thats how you do it, so some of the old fashion people probably didnt agree. other then that dont worry about it and dont take it personal.|`|AA11579568	I have a feeling you aren't telling the story (now watch, i'll get a thumbs down even though I know right from wrong).|`|DNygQdmVaa	Dont ask me.  I think thats wrong even if theyre teething.    but the whole nonsense teen thing?  Im 19 and a mom. I dont think age has anything to do with it,|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I look at it this way - to the person who said "a little bit on the gums wont hurt the baby" If it is not reccommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women to have ANY alcohol - why would it be ok to give the child alcohol first hand on their gums?  Its the act of a FOOL to give a child alcohol, and anyone who does so should be prosocuted for child endangerment and abuse.  THATS WHY THEY HAVE TEETHING GELS AND INFANT PANDADOL TO HELP WITH THE PAIN - SO IDIOTS DON'T USE ALCOHOL.    In answer to the original question, i have found there to be ALOT of people on here who THINK they know what is right, but are far from it.  It amazes me when i get heaps of thumbs down, and i would think some of my answers are in line with the common sense.|`|opUngk8waa	yeah i don't get it either .  all the good moral answers to my questions have an overwhelming amount of thumbs down !! what's wrong with people, idk !|`|S545jx81aa	i know it sounds TERRIBLE when mothers say putting some alcohol on babies gums to help with pain but its not bad. My faimly and all my friends families goes by that. Just dipping your finger in a thing of whiskey or something along that line and just rubbing a TINY bit of the gums to numb them a bit is a good thing. It just numbs the gums to help with teething pain. Not bad. Trust me it works i have seen it first hand. it sounds bad but if you have seen how much they use its not. :S    ok so i have never been pregnant but i have talked to mothers and doctors and an occasional small glass of wine is supposedly ok during pregnancy. And a little dab of whiskey on the gums to help a baby with pain isn't going to kill them or make them drunk it just helps with pain. If seen a baby scream and scream and they gave them the gel things and everything and it wasnt helping. Then they put a LITTLE bit of whiskey on her gums and it numbed up the pain for a little while for her to use the gel things for it to help.|`|claW4UUcaa	i agree with the first answer it was probably just trolls. i get mad too though. i take being a mother very seriously. just joking about things like that ticks me off. i can't watch the news anymore. it's just to heartbreaking. if i need the weather i watch the weather channel.
T87pwfi4aa	N00dz?    Because people are stupid and redundant.  They have to drag EVERYTHING out!  I would never send anyone naked pics because what if we break up?  He could show everyone!  I learned that from Vanessa Hudgens lol.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I think it is fun personally. I have sent nude pictures to probably around 17 guys and none of them have been sent around. I don't think it is bad as long as you are smart about it, I trust all the guys not to send them around and I don't put my head in any of the pictures. I send random nude pics to my boyfriend and he loves them, it's just harmless fun to me.|`|oqUci1MNaa	i agree with you.|`|ZAppRn5Faa	i know exactly what you mean. people just want attention.|`|7UIoQFKJaa	.......|`|0P4rtupoaa	because people are too shame to do it in person.      XD      idk, i never got anything like that.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	i've noticed most of the people who do that  are the ones who want to show off  and plus there not thinking because with technology these days  it can be forwarded to like the whole world and everyone gets to see   which is very embarrassing.  and i agree if they really had to show off they should just do it right then in there.  but honestly people like that need to stop|`|kRaVa0Wraa	haha yeah i know.  my (guy) friends girlfriend sent him nudes and suddenly EVERYONE saw them. even me. ick.     and people were making fun of her because she didnt take care of her hair *down there*|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	What is your point?
Xrwvu5Uraa	I'm 21 also and 21weeks 5days pregnant with my first and I didn't really "feel" pregnant until I was about 18 weeks. I still don't think I've felt the baby move really.    Don't worry about the heart beat that is something that you shouldn't nessecarily stress about right now! Stress is no good!    Just eat what and when you can. Don't force yourself to eat anything and it will not nessecarily hurt your baby, just make sure you are taking your pre-natal vitamins everyday because baby is taking from you and you need your nutrients and supplements!    Congrats and good luck =)|`|cSm1zod4aa	Your age has nothing to do with it by the way ;-) Im 20.  Try not to worry, I think every pregnant woman has had that worry, it goes away after you get so many months. No, not being hungry will not hurt the baby. Just eat when your hungry. I am 5 months pregnant and other than the sore boobs and being kicked/punched from the inside, i have no other symptoms. I never had morning sickness either. consider yourself lucky!!|`|LABC73E7aa	the hungry and not hungry thing is normal. you are not hurting your baby in any way. sometimes we dont have access to food right away! like if we are out or at work. your just worried. dont stress yourself. good luck!|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i didnt really 'feel pregnant' until around 22 wks. your fine. and just eat when your hungry thats the best thing to do. i was really sick the first half of my pregnancy and didnt feel like eating so i didnt. just keep taking your vitamins :)|`|sPr2HhYEaa	Your baby is probably just fine. When I was expecting my first child I too was totally freaked out thinking the baby would be deformed or not have a head or something I was so silly.  I think it is normal to worry but try not to. When you get hungry eat because sometimes not eating can make your stomach upset or queasy. The baby will take what it needs from you so if you don't eat, you can get run down physically so take care of yourself & eat & rest.|`|fIUr49ujaa	Sweetie it's ok calm down.  I think every woman is scared somewhat during pregnancy.  I was terrified during each of mine.  If you are that worried you can get a little machine at most baby places that way you can hear the babies heart beat anytime you are feeling scared.  It has this little microphone you can rub on your belly while you wear head phone.  Trust me they help sooth your fears that something is wrong.  Every woman is different so every pregnancy is different.  It's ok really.  Calm down and just take a deep breath.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Ask the parents before they leave for the evening about bedtime routines. The best way to get children to bed is to stick with their normal routine. Generally if I watch a child who is distraught over mom and dad not being there and calling them to let the kid say goodnight isn't possible I assure them that I will make sure that their parents come in and kiss them as soon as they get home; that usually works great. Or, tell them that they have to stay in bed until you come to check on them in five or ten minutes and if they are still awake and upset they can stay up (I've never had a kid still awake when I went to check in with them).|`|K9QpF4S3aa	what I would do is give them some warm milk or hot coco. It usually makes kids sleepy. If this doesn't work you should try to read them a boring story! Make sure the story isn't a bad one, something kinda strange or exciting will be a good choice.|`|FA710vETaa	the best way to make a child go to sleep is to put them in their bed and let them scream. Make sure and check up on them and if all is well then they will be out in 30 min. a child has to learn to put themselfs to sleep|`|briRpzL1aa	Easy... Feed them something with allot of fat in it..   Also, limit any simple sugar consumption...    For example... Hot chocolate with whole milk, or some half and half.  Fat is very dense in calories, does not give a rush of sugar to the blood stream, and moves blood to the digestive track.  This makes the person get tired and fall asleep...    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps...|`|BylgJSEJaa	when i baby-sit my little cousin,i put him to sleep on a warm heating pat...in minutes he's out like a light...also if they need light or television to sleep,turn on a show they enjoy w/ low volume or a room w/ dimmed lighting.don't ever put them in a dark roon where they'll scream_;|

Tory is from Mythbusters and Sebastien is from Simple Plan  3- Elexiana- except the a's have those two dots above them to make the name and the sound seem more awesome.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	My children are named Christopher and Sara.|`|dRG025hyaa	i love the names Maria Antoinette,jason,demetre,mikey,kenny,fra...|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	Those are great names!

Olivia  Kate or Katherine  Natalie  Julianna or Juliana (Julie and Anna are family names)  Sienna  Kiara  Evelyn  Maia  Marissa    James  Liam  Connor  Lucas  Aidan  Tony(Family name)  Tristan  Noah  Blake  Seth or Thomas (Thomas is a family name)    I really like Elizabeth as well :)|`|G0s5uxrEaa	I love the names Bryce and Grier|`|NOAwj4pOaa	i really like the name Evelyn and Edward|`|QeWbIQ5qaa	i like MAIRE.

My baby is a week old and I used it today for a while to try it out and so far I love it and so does he.|`|AA11021960	Personally, I couldn't get a sling that would not squish my son because I am larger breasted.  I had the Nojo and it stunk!!!  What I found that I love love love is the HipHammock.  I like that better because you don't feel it at all on your back, it is really easy to get baby in and out of.  For me it worked because when I bf I don't have him in anything.  If you are looking for something to take in public and be able to bf in, the hip hammock won't work... or at least it would be a lil more difficult.  I use it while I go for my walks, grocery shopping or while at my older sons sporting events.  I don't go anywhere without it.    JMHO  :)
WbJPQM1naa	Well, I'm sure you will get a wide variety of answers to this question!  Every baby is different and every woman will be different.  So, our feelings might not necessarily be your own.    I had seven.  I usually felt a quiet assurance the day before my labor began.  When the contractions started, I knew, with my intuitive nature, that my labor had begun.  The only one which was not really sure was my third, my son.  I was in labor.. or so I thought and having light contractions all day.  But, I wasn't dilating and my doctor wouldn't let me go to the hospital.  I was very frustrated, because I knew once they picked up and I got to the hospital my labor would be quick.  I was right and my doctor actually missed the birth!    Statistically, less than 10% of labors begin with the membranes rupturing(water breaking).  Most times its just a gradual thing.  Contractions begin, usually about 10-20 mins apart.  They gradually increase in duration and effectiveness and are coming more often.  But, it's not like everything just happens all at once, for most.  Its a gradual building and you will somehow just know the right time.      When you begin, take as much rest and relaxation as you possibly can.  Eat, drink plenty of fluids, walk and breath.  Take a nice hot soak or a long walk outside, if weather permits.  Do whatever feels good for you!  You don't need to go to hospital for early labor and if you do, you increase your chance of having interventions that you really don't need in a normal, low risk birth.  So, stay home as long as you can.  Read, sing, laugh! (this opens up your cervix)... whatever you need to do!      Don't worry about knowing... you will just KNOW when it's really time.  Most women do.  When your contractions build in intensity and come quicker with less time between, you know you are having real labor.  When you cannot quiet them by drinking a big glass of water and laying down for a bit, thats the beginning.  Then your only job is take them ONE at a time, breath deep, relax everything in your body and stay open.  Your throat is directly connected to your cervix, which is why laughing and singing can help promote your body to dilate.    Good luck, and don't worry.  YOU CAN do this!  Every woman is equipped to have their baby naturally and without pain meds.  I did it and I know you can too!    Many Blessings,  R    Meanwhile, watch this great video I found called "Pregnant in America"... it is fantastic!  http://www.megavideo.com/?v=QTRRAG2A|`|6Svqb2xAaa	i went straight in. my water broke and NO contractions. so it can happen to you NOW or in a day or a week.|`|aMpMFLo3aa	I felt like getting my last things that I had to get done like put my daughters diapers in her organizer then went to sleep and at 3 am I woke and my water broke ;)|`|PkbPOWzsaa	every pregnancy is different therefore every labor as well.i had my first baby at 38 weeks and five days and i was huge and i was felling heavy and tired all the time but nothing like a sign except i woke up at 2 in the morning with a little pain like the one that u have when you get your period an i went to the bathroom and "splash" my water broke.but i had my baby 30 hours later.with my second one i just had my check up and they told me i was dilated 2cm (and i was 35 weeks and 5days).they said i can go like this for another 3 weeks..they gave me tylenol just in case i will have pain later.after 2 hours i took the first pain killer.by midnight   i had pain(contraction) every 8 minutes apart,rush to hospital had my baby 5 hours later.so you will know when the time comes but be prepared prior to due date...just in case:).best luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	great relaxed then my water broke|`|yfcJwQr8aa	when i started to dialate...I just thought i was cramping really bad(i was at home)  I was pacing around my room holding between my legs..lol.  But I just thought I was cramping really bad until i went for my appointment 2 days later...when I got to my appt I had already dialated 4 cm...wow huh|`|3klIx1Egaa	i was just extremely irritable, and could not get comfortable within the 24 hrs leading up to labour.  Other then that nothing, and suprise my water broke at 3am.|`|fHgbL046aa	I remember how I felt NERVOUS. I had to be induced so I was at the hospital at 7:30am to get hooked up.
qHAgbuHkaa	It is supposed to dry up when the baby is done breast feeding. A milk supply is supposed to stay steady as long as you continue to breast feed. Once you completely stop breast feeding, the milk will begin to stop producing. Although you won't be producing milk the same, it takes some time before the milk is completely gone. I stopped breast feeding my son 14 months ago and I can still squeeze some out if I try hard enough. But as long as you keep breast feeding, the breasts continue to produce more milk.|`|BQpQewOAaa	When I had my first child, I did not breast feed, and the nurses bound my chest.  After I left the hospital, I had to wear a tight sports bra.  Oh, it was so painful.  I feel for you, but one thing I noticed was whenever I got in the bath tub, I would start leaking, it was visible in the water.  I think it took a good month for everything to go back to normal.  Good luck to you, and congrats on the new baby.|`|356f8f209dcd6dc30f57b5bcaa4830f6aa	To the best of my knowledge the milk supply will last as long as baby is nursing    It is the nursing  that stimulates the milk flow.. Normally after the baby stops nursing it will take awhile for the milk flow to stop.  If you have been breast feeding for awhile and want to stop your breast will probably feel sore and full and will still probably leak until the milk supply has ceased.  Also, I have heard that after you stop breast feeding you can still experience leakage from six months to up to two years after you stop.  Hope this has helped some.
L1KVUIJ6aa	spanking and nipple grabs?! what kind of high school do u go to? well if i was in ur shoes and that **** happened to me i would lay someone out too! Give them a reason to stop, they sound like a bunch of fags!|`|0b942db656cf91b93e0853fad2dd236eaa	Just ignore them, if it persists, give them a solid punch to the stomach or cheek, then walk away.    If it keeps happening, beat the punks asses in front of everyone!|`|CLvc8teXaa	Haha. Give them a good knuckle sandwich in the noise. Thats what I did in middle school to a bully and he never bothered me again. We actually became friends.|`|b6QG2hQ3aa	if they start grabbing your nipples dont worry theyre the losers in that situation.  just pop one in theyre nose, not the best shrt term solution a good long term one.|`|9taVf4wbaa	just ignore them or bite them|`|623zz8d7aa	Ask your parents to go with you to talk to the school principal and gym teacher. If they don't help by disciplining the boys, then tell them you are going to go to the superintendent's office. THis is ridiculous that you should have to be in a threatening environment. School needs to be a safe place where you an learn. If your parents won't go, then you go. Maybe your older brother or sister or grandparents, uncle or other person could get involved, too.    No, don't do anything stupid like start a gang. That is the biggest mistake you could possibly make.    If you were my kid, I'd tell the school that things better change so that you have a safe environment or they'll be smelling a lawsuit!    Good luck!!|`|gILygKvRaa	*cough troll cough*|`|KwwAmaqqaa	lol a gang your funny..... you cant make a gang a gang is homies shooting other ppl not fighting...you can make a krew though its homies that tag and back each other up..... so u can get ppl that dont like the guys that pick on u 2 back u up and hlp u beat those guys up 2gether then u can make a krew and back each other up|`|eeKp9mStaa	BASH THEM BABE|`|AA11579568	Ever thought of telling on them and getting them suspended?

7m9HVlYtaa	Well I don't have kids yet but I've been volunteering on and off in several preschools/headstart programs for awhile so let me tell you what type of things I've noticed. As previously mentioned, its not a bad idea to check with your state or whatever local governing body monitors this to see if any of the places you're considering have a lot of complaints. Avoid these like the plague, particularly if their behavioral type issues.    You wanna ask about what kind of people will be with your daughter. Ask what kind of training they require of their staff. What sort of education do the teachers have? Ask what the adult staff member to child ratio will be like. Lots of the places I've volunteered at have been because the teacher was in way over her head and needed help. Not exactly the ideal situation as asking random college kids to come herd your kids is not the preferred method. Its okay to get volunteers but how heavily do they depend on them? Ask what kind of experience the teachers have- how long they've been working with kids, etc.     Apart from their rates ask what your paying for. How long are their programs? What do they include? Snacks/Nutrition? What's a typical day like? What kinds of things do they focus on, any specific goals? Is there a religious aspect and are you okay with that? Personally, I'm a big fan of Montessori Preschools but there tends to be a higher cost.     Also, there will be other parents there so don't be afraid to ask them about their experiences if its their second or third kid that they're there for. Good Luck!|`|IErPuZnkaa	Contact DHS to check into any problems that they might have.  We are all human and make errors but this will help you see if they get reported alot and caught in the act.
1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	Ask to see Standardized Test Scores to compare how well their students do compared to the public school students.    Ask what type of "specials"/electives the school offers.    Find out how the curriculum is designed.  Do they follow the state guidelines, or do they have their own benchmarks?    I love my daughters' school.  They both attend a private school.  The parent involvement is especially high, and there are no major behavior problems to deal with like they have in the public schools.  My first grader is reading a third grade level.    One dislike:  There is no Orchestra, only band, while the public school offers both.|`|15popp31aa	I would prefer public school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ztNo0IZYaa	Public schools are a lot more reliable,safer, and your children will be a lot more comfortable. Most private schools have uniforms, and usually have strange rules. in addition, they are very strict, and can do anything they want if it's not against the law. public schools provide a nice, comfortable environment, and they also have safety regulations for every school in the district for children to be safe. Most public schools do not have uniforms, however in my district, some of them have a dress code (example: you can only wear blue, white, or yellow, ect.) I totally recommend public. The safe, stable, and reliable way for your child's education. Not to mention, private schools are money eaters. I do not recommend taking children to a pocket digging school.|`|9taVf4wbaa	i go to st peter elementary in nj merchantville it is very nice and educational and there are many extra cirriclum activities like basketball football cheerleading  chior alter service|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I pay alot of money to send my kids to private school. They get an education not a dumbed down version ...created to pass tests . They actually learn in detail and hands on.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Private schools suck!    Go PUBLIC!! ^_^

Brooke is kinda common though, Cameron sounds so cute and not just a baby name but something he could grow up with.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Yeah Brooke is cute for a girl.  I also like:  -Sarah  -Rachel  -Haley  -Rosalie (or anything with Rose in it)  -Isabella  -Annabeth  -Anastasia  -Gwendolyn  -Gabriella  -Allyson (my name)|`|7UIoQFKJaa	im not crazy about the name brooke for a girl but i love the name cameron for a boy:)|`|p1ZkG7Hgaa	oooooooh!!!!! I love those names!!!!! Mine are Isabella, and Jonathan!!! My moms second choice for me was Brooke, I would rather be Brooke than Brittany. Brooke is less common, and Cameron sounds like an adult name so if it's a boy he won't get made fun of in high school. Both names are great!!!!!!!! (in my opinion) ?|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Brooke is nice but very popular now.  I always try to find something a little different if I can.  Cameron for a boy is nice.  Try the website www.babynames.com which has a great selection of names and get out books as well.|`|doSdEtqYaa	cameron is nice! For a girl i think kaci would be nice! because kaci means brace! ;)|`|SUBqk9WQaa	Cute names!!

XzV4bUeFaa	Your name is fine.  Alexandrea Jean Surges sound really nice together.  As long as you can use your nicknames, don't change it.  Out of your nicknames I like Lexi best.  Lexi Jean is a very cute name.|`|EFzXvfbQaa	i would put it alltogether..no harm in that    Selena Jean-Marie  Selena-jean Marie  Selena-Marie Jean  Selena Marie Jean    or Angelina Marie!    i love that name|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Selena like the singer??? Your name is fine I love long names Mine is Tyffannie Lynne Fluitt  both my kids have long names|`|JpmKtpqmaa	i honestly like your name...its very classy|`|8NvjYY6Naa	Well i like it cuz my name alixandra jean too!

Selena's pretty but I personally think its weird to change your name in general.|`|cR8UZdi1aa	Are you 14? Sounds like it.  Alex is perfect, stay with that!
V9pZ0t8Saa	yes bad cramps and increased discharge in both my pregnancies and both m kids were fine|`|627pWyVkaa	yes But doctors will worry that you could have an ectopic pregnancy. test for pregnancy if you are pregnant (go to the doctors) you'll need a scan if your having abdominal pain because as i said they fear it can be ectopic. (or your ligaments getting ready to stretch)It may not be, Mine wasn't but it was worrying some and best to find out right away incase it is, you would need surgery to have it removed so you don't burst your tubes and die. If not pregnant you might still want to see your doctor if your getting a lot of pain. (however sometimes cramps come before, and during your period (it may be that coming soon!) good luck|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yes at the start of a pregnancy you can get cramps mine felt like my period was going to come, so forever I didnt think I was pregnant until my period never showed up.  You really need to take a test just to make sure and see if you are pregnant. Hope this helps|`|4MffVLX8aa	You should probably first make sure you're actually having a baby...  But I'm pretty sure that cramping is a normal symptom in the beginning of pregnancy|`|F2RFHOmjaa	Have you taken a pregnancy test? If not, then you should.  If your not pregnant your period is most likely on its way.  If you are pregnant, the cramping may just be your body adjusting.  Either way, you should take a test and then consult with you doctor.|`|fHgbL046aa	I'm 17 weeks pregnant and I get awful cramps and so much pain. I never experienced that with my daughter. I know I'm suppose to have my gal-bladder removed years ago and wonder if that will cause any problems. I'm gonna ask my doctor on Tuesday.|`|gRcVgmxVaa	There could be a lot of reasons for cramping in early pregnancy or it could be a sign of a coming menstrual cycle. It could be normal muscle stretching, an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that is outside of the uterus), a miscarriage, etc. The first thing you need to do is take a pregnancy test. If it is positive and the pain continues or gets worse, please see a doctor. An ectopic pregnancy can be fatal if not treated in time.
AA12221392	Where i live it is 5 years old.. I live in michigan|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I'm pretty sure it's 5. But that's in Ohio...call and ask someone from CPS, they should know.|`|jPlUycx0aa	10 years old|`|edoxElQfaa	i have 7 year old twins a boy and a girl they share a room|`|CnM2U1bXaa	probably about 8 or 9|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	No. They are brother and sister. They can share a room until whenever you get a bigger place and they won't have to share. It's not anybody's business if they share rooms until they're 30. My 18-year-old son and I live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. Anybody going to call CPS on me?|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- the folks who administer public housing in the US -- stipulate that boys and girls age six and over can't share a bedroom.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	All states have different laws on that, but I would personally have to say when they start school...age 5 or 6.|`|GgVJzDjDaa	Well, I live in a 2 room apartment. My parents live in one room and my 2 sisters and I live in the other. I'm 18 (still in hs, lol) one is 15 and the youngest one is 9. We definitely don't live perfectly. My 15 yr old sister and I used to fight a lot, it has cooled down but. to answer your question is has to be at about 13-14 when puberty sets in.|`|fgSugxDeaa	maybe when they start noticing the birds and the bees|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes there is, and every state has a different law about it. Call social services...cys,cps and so on, and ask them what the age is in your area.|`|xukz46NFaa	Children once 6yrs old, can no longer share bedrooms... Girls must have their own room and boys their own...  :)  Good luck...|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	I would say 10 or when the female gets her period. Which ever comes first.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	No, there are no LAWS. The police can't come into your house and take you or your kids away for sharing a bedroom. I know someone who lives in a 2 bdrm house with her hubby & 3 kids and they ALL share a bedroom and they are way over these little limits you guys are talking about.    They can't come in and do anything. It's none of their business.  And I live in Ohio.    EDIT: IF there IS something in writing you all should know it's a load of crap. Sorry but do you really think that the gov't can tell you how to live? Then again, with Obama as president we might just find out.|`|dfBjPB1laa	In Wisconsin it is 3.  I'm sure it is different everywhere.  Call CPS and ask.|`|5QiVZ2azaa	im pretty sure there isn't an age where boys and girls are not allowed to share a room but i would think at around 12-14 would be a good time|`|YMdYyRmqaa	when they start noticing the other parts.  my cousins kids were 12 when they were still sharing a room and one night she found them on top of eachother in their room on the floor naked. they wanted to do like mom and dad. Wow right? yeah! I would say when they notice the other parts.
WbJPQM1naa	Many parents do not realize that without an actual LEGAL order of custody from a court, whether you're primary caregiver or not, your child's custody is only as far as what parent the child is with.  If the other parent wants to take the child, they can at any time and take them anywhere they want.  So, if you are not in a committed relationship with your child's father, it is in your best interests to go to court and file for legal custody of your child.    Most courts today take a lot of things into consideration in deciding which parent the child stays with.  They use a guideline, written in the state statutes (laws), usually found in their "children's code", which specifies what things the judge will consider when determining the "best interests" of the child in question.  I am enclosing links to a site for your state which will direct you to the laws in MA.  READ them and if you have any questions about the legal wording, feel free to message me further with that.    The "best interests" litmus test usually includes these things:    a. financial : how each parent is financially able to care for the child.                  Whether parents are employed.  If so, who will care for child while parent works.    b.  PRIMARYcaregiver:  this is probably the most important aspect.  If you have been your child's primary caregiver.. meaning that you provide MOST of the day to day care:  feeding, bathing, dressing, teaching, playing, ect.. Than you need to document this for the court.  Your baby's father, while having been the baby's financial provider, his working does NOTexcuse him from providing day to day care as well.  So, if he doesn't do that, or provide your baby with quality time when he is not working, that will make a difference in how the judge decides.    c.  Each parent's documented ability to place the needs of the child before their own.  This is kind of a gray area for some courts.  But if your child's father chooses to spend his free time focused on himself or his needs, instead of being aware of your child's needs, you need to document this as well.  If he is a good parent and you feel that your child benefits from his relationship with him, then I would make this known to the court as well.    I read your state's criteria, and for joint custody, both parties have to be in agreement and sign something agreeing to it, prior to court.      Also, if there are any issues in your relationship where you might feel unsafe, or victimized.  Or if your baby's father is abusive to you in ANY way: verbal, emotional, mental, or physical.  You MUST document this for the court.  The quickest way to protect you and your baby, and win temporary LEGAL custody is to file for a restraining order.  If you feel at ALL unsafe, or threatened by him, get help and protect yourself.     So, don't worry.  Check into getting legal aid if you can.  If not, it is not impossible to have a custody dispute and represent yourself.  READ the law, and any other resources you can.  Also, check with your court and see if they have a "pro se" resource center. Good luck.    R|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	are you breaking up??? You both have custody unless brought to court to fight it.|`|fscgp7iFaa	IDK but if you're not married and you had the kid i think its leaning in your favor...I mean what kind of sacrfice did he go through to have this kid...sex?|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Well if you are still together I don't see what you are getting at. You do have full custody. If you were to end the relationship, he would have to hire an attorney and file court papers requesting legitimization and joint custody. Chances are unless he has a very shady past the judge will grant him these rights, keep in mind he would also have to pay child support and get visits every other weekend and split holidays.A DNA test will also more then likely be required to ensure he is the father.|`|vMjbeQyFaa	The only way custody is determined is through child support order or the courts.  There is a difference between custody and physical placement.  Custody does not automatically go to the mother.  Just because he works 5 days a week doesn't mean he can't have custody.  If anything, it's a point in his favor as he can prove he is able to support the child.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	You don't have full custody actually. Being married has nothing to do with you having full custody. Neither of you have custody at this point. To gain full custody you have to go to court. If your boyfriend takes the kid and leaves the police will do nothing. They will tell you to go to court or "kidnap" him back. Yes they would probably give him joint it doesn't matter what his work is like joint doesn't mean equal time it can but that is not a given. It just means you are supposed to make joint decisions regarding activities, religion, school, doctors.|`|k4uZwN0daa	I am not sure what your laws are, but you both have equal rights to the baby. Meaning that it is equal custody. If you have the baby and did not want him to see the baby by law you dont have to give him the child because the child is your care. Now the same goes for him if he has the child he does not have to give the baby back either. Now that does not mean that either party( u or him) never see the child again, it just means you both have equal rights. So at that point you would go to court file temporary custody and wait for a court hearing to make arrangements for the child. Usually when filing temporary custody you have to have a lagit reason for doing so. The best thing to do is make an agreement, and if the relationship is that rocky keep the child in your care until something is written up. Now, unless he had probable cause to see you as an unfit parent the courts would probably not give him the child. Mothers always have the upper hand unless you are unstable. I hope all goes well for you and it works out Good Luck!!!!!1111
NysFTExhaa	My brother and I are the products of fertility treatments and I always get upset when people like your friends say stuff like that.  We wouldn't exist without the treatments and it's almost like they're saying we shouldn't have been born.|`|NTfIJa7zaa	Kate took fertility drugs so why would they say this. I am watching it too and didnt hear that.??    LOL...U meant your friends said that!! Sorry, no i don't think it is immoral. People generally take the drugs because they have little to no chance of producing, how would that be immoral?|`|6yCqTPSyaa	personally i think it's fine my brother and his wife are gonna try it..... if for some reason it doesn't work , i'm thinkin bout bein a seragent mother for them, i already have 4 children and they have tried for 5 years and nothing yet, but yes i also have a cousin that is a result of fertility treatments|`|6yYeCVQFaa	Your friends? Well maybe they don't know the pain that some women go through to get pregnant. I would ask them to be a little bit more sensitive to others desire to become parents. After 5 years of trying I was afraid that my husband and I would have to resort to having these treatment but thankfully God felt we were ready without it and we are 11 weeks pregnant. Recently I have seen on the news that some women gave birth to 8 babies and she already 6 babies. I think that is sick and immoral. I also think both of the Duggars should be sterilized. God said to populate the planet but he didn't speak just to the Duggars. The world is very overpopulated and this is just crazy in a cult kind of way. I think Jon and Kate are wonderful and for those that have problems getting pregnant I see no harm in trying to have a baby. It becomes immoral whenever you are trying to start your own football team.|`|Wjo2X9LRaa	They are speaking like people that ha vent had trouble getting pregnant! You cant understand what people like Myself and my hubby have gone through just have a child, unless you have gone through it yourself.     I personally think that everyone should have as much trouble having children like I did! It really makes you appreciate your children more. You don't appreciate something unless you have to work for it! That's what I think... Maybe there wouldnt be any abuse and people would stop killing their babies!!!|`|AA11210211	Personally I am agnostic borderline atheist so I don't really have an opinion when it comes to God because I don't believe there is one,but I find comments like this a little umm harsh I guess I could say,I mean a baby is a wonderful thing and when someone has problems having one they should have something to turn to to help them have one.I know if I wouldn't have been able to have children I would have tried just about everything no matter what other people think about it.|`|p0prrzf2aa	kate used fertility treatments...      hypocrits..|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	no, I don't think they are immoral at all...although the main reasoning on some people thinking that is that they believe God makes women pregnant to those who are meant to be, there is no such things as "accidents" and "fertility treatments"|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no its not, it give childless couples a chance to become pregnant, now the lady who already had 6 kids and just had 8 more and is single, no job, went bankrupt last year, and lives in a 3 bedroom house with her parents and 14 children she used invitro just because she wanted more kids then she already had, that is immoral and selfish and is abusive of the technology.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I'm not FOND OF the Gosselin's|`|t3A9qpQIaa	What moral code would be violated?|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dont think that it is immoral. I think it is very sad that there are women and men out there that cant have a baby on their own, so what is the problem with seeking some help? I bet if it was happening to your "friends" and they couldnt have children that they really wanted I bet they wouldnt think that it was immoral|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	Um, are you sure you didn't misunderstand the discussion? They used fertility treatments to conceive if I remember right...|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	no because its different for different ppl not everyone can get pregnant easy and need a little help giving someone something to help there chances of getting pregnant isn't bad because you still have to have sex like every other couple out there that are trying for kids|`|KNxs4PrZaa	clearly they have never wanted a baby and had trouble concieving,  sometimes fertility is just as simple as solving a simple health problem, like my body was not producing very much a a hormone that my repoducitve system needed and taking a hormone pill solved that and i got pregnant.  How can there be anything immoral about having a baby! there are so many terrible things in the world that is the last thing to worry about.  A baby is a blessing from god no matter what and the god i know would not have any problem with a little help from fertility treatments, humans arent perfect and we all have health issues, god doesnt want us to suffer from them thats why he let medicines and treatment be created.  how silly.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i think some ppl need help and fertility treatments are there to do just that i think its great that some  who are trying to concive  have options if they have trubble doing it alone.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	Being as they did fsh injections wish a form of infertility drugs.I use to watch that show than it was like Kate got the big head a mouth to go with it so I stopped watching it      i think that sometimes the body isn't perfect and needs a little help.Physically humans have many flaws and fertility is often one of those.God knew this when he made us    Sorry about that well like one of the prevouis answers said they don't know the heartache of wanting to be oregnant and or stay pregnant and for whatever reasons can't I have had 2 miscarriages as wellas two births the births were before the misscarriage I have a gene isssue that cause me to lose the 2 babies.It is hard and it is trully something that if you haven't gone though it tere is no way to understand|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	I think fertility treatment is great to have a family. I don't agree with abortion after if you get pregnant with to many.    I DO NOT agree with I don't know how you call it     where you pick     gender  eye color  hair color  long legs  what specials the baby have like...good at endurance sports, good at running, artistic, musical and more     and so much more     I do think that is going to far and trying to make the perfect baby    If you want to get pregnant and you get fertility help be happy with what ever baby you get.     When it comes down to filling out an application and selecting all the qualities you want is going to far.     I do think you need to be open an honest with your dr when it comes to this.
m0DgqEcjaa	I wouldn't worry, all i know is your baby will come when ready :-) (even though your dates sound more accurate)<br>  <br>  Due date is normally estimated from your last day of your period.<br>  <br>  Mine was 22nd June 2008 and the doctor left my due date at 29th March 2009.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	based on 40 weeks according to your period dates your due date would be May 22nd. Try it for yourself<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/duedate/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/duedate/...</a>|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Well if your doc said May 28th and you think May 22 or 23... then that's not that much of a difference...|`|MubTZUKXaa	Well, I know that they give you a estimated due date at your 12 week scan and this is based on the size of the baby not the date of your last period.  It is only before this scan that your due date will be based on your last period.<br>  To be given a due date from a scan later than 12 weeks can be unreliable due to the variations in growth between each baby.  Each baby can grow at their own pace.<br>  So they say 28th and you think 23rd, little spermies can survive quite a while in your womb, it's possible that you had intercourse on the 25th August but never ovulated until 30th August... so the egg and sperm didn't meet until a later day.<br>  My due date was changed in relation to the date I ovulated rather than the date of my fertility treatment.  My egg was in there a day waiting for the sperm... my due date was brought forward a day without them even knowing about the treatment side... it goes to show that it's the egg not the dates etc.<br>  <br>  Hope I made sense!  Either way a few days won't make a big difference, she'll come when she's ready! xxx|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Use whatever date you want, 5 days means nothing because due dates ARE estimates and full-term means anything from 37-42 weeks and baby could come at any time during that period of time. Personally I think you're overanalyzing and are debating / arguing over a moot point. Ultrasounds aren't perfect, precise measures of gestation, and it's very normal to have a variance of 2 weeks in either direction of what could be the actual due date. Stick with your due date based on your LMP date = add 7 days and subtract 3 months - your due date would be May 22. Your doctor will be using this date, they don't change it based on the ultrasound date unless several scans confirm that measurements are more than 2 weeks off.|`|DutTBV3caa	it sounds to me like they were calculating from your menstrual cycle and you were calculating from the day you had sex. <br>  the same thing happened to me. my menstrual cycle started dec 15th and i either got pregnant on christmas night or the night after. i went in thinking i was 6weeks along and they told me that i was 8. <br>  <br>  i dont think its wrong to calculate your own due date but you should keep the one the doctor gives you in mind.
E7LSetRHaa	I think almost everyone faces discrimination and most people are accused of some form of discrimination. I am a white American. When I was in school if I was friends with everyone. Once in a while if I didn't get along with someone it was because I was a "stuck up white girl" What does my skin color have to do with it. I am not racist at all but racism will never go away. I agree with the above comment. Skin color should not play a role in getting a job or anything else in that matter. As for your question, yes white Americans do face more discrimination. On direct tv they have stations just for blacks and latinos but what would happen if we had white starz. We would be racist. I dont know the difference.|`|gvPdhQXKaa	ya i get made fun of cause im white    most of the time the people are just joking    but some people call me a rich white girl    but im not rich     it just gets so annoying|`|bRcgITRSaa	i think every one is discriminated on in some way and every one just needs too get over it not only white people|`|DN9RZHi3aa	when im at school all the black girls look down on the white girls like they are better then us, they dont seem to understand equality, they tease and make other people feel degraded, they have been fighting this battle since the beginning of time, and it seems like all of our knowledge of the past went to waste  and yes, more white americans are facing discrimination lately|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	im white mix married to a black man with two malato kids I face it all the time I also get treated like sh*it because of my low income. Like when I sign up for low income stuff I get a whole change of how im treated. Its funny because I clean up well. If I tie my hair up and dress in a suit I get treated so well in store and if I am just me comfy with my boy's. I get treated crappy|`|kRaVa0Wraa	um no.   seriously...??? stop trying to make it seem as though whites are the ones being hated on.  we're still the VAST majority of the US.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Omg, yes my spanish teacher is racist against whites, it so annoying.  No it is not just me who thinks this either, everyone does.  Ughhh I hate her.|`|z2izukQJaa	yes i have.    when i was in high shcool in toledo ohio    the african american girls used to think they were so tough and always called me little white girl, or automatically assumed because i was white i was a rich *****, which im actually pretty poor and always have been.    they would try to bully white girls so much. i didnt stand for it though. i actually ended up fighting a girl because she was talking **** about me being white|`|8be367fe78353833dcfd48377d2502ecaa	I would say that there are more racist ideas/thoughts out there today, but it's not as harsh or violent as it was.  There is racism in public/city jobs.  Many cities (when hiring police, fire etc) hire one white, one african american, one indian, one female...etc....Instead of who is most qualified for a job.  If they all take the same test and the top twenty scores are Indians, they will only hire the first one and skip the scores to get to the White, African American, female...etc.  The firemen/policemen coming to your home may not be the most qualified...he may just have been hired based on his ethnicity.  I understand the basis for this type of hiring is to avoid lawsuits of  discrimination...but in a sense it is reverse discrimination.

vJEatJFPaa	Hi !    Honestly, I wouldn't bother spending the $. I bought one for Livi when she was an infant and I maybe used it 3 times because she used to hate her stroller. Soon enough Lexi will be mobile and won't need it. I bought an Infantino one from Target for around $35. Worked very well but carrying that baby around IS a heavy load...Hope this helps with whatever you decide to do....If you wanted to try one out I wish I could just email mine to you so you wouldn't have to spend the $...LOL|`|kqa9VFrfaa	When the baby is ready 4 a carrier try to get an L.L. Bean one. They are made well, and are very sturdy on the ground when U set it up as a seat. They also have good storage areas for diapers and food. If U can't afford a new one look for a used one.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Any kind of carrier that you can get and do a hip carry will be helpful to you. And if it does a back carry as well, even better. My son 5 1/2 months old, but weighs about the same as yours. I use an infantino side rider that i bought on clearance for $8 at Target. Though if i hadn't found it, I would have bought a mei tai wrap. babyhawk.com sells really cute ones, and ones for older babies (toddlerhawk).|`|uERNim0yaa	My boys loved ours.  I used it until the next one was ready for it.  :)  The "baby" (now 15 years old and bigger than me!) stayed in ours until he went to school.  It is a wonderful feeling.  Buy quality and you can hold onto it for your next baby.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	What a big baby :)    The Baby Bjorn holds babies up to 27 lbs. (25 for some styles). I'm not sure if there's any sling/wrap/carrier out there that will hold your daughter, but if you find one she will love it, and so will you! Plus it will make going out with baby so much easier.
H2T2pKvXaa	Story of my life. Im still waiting for the guys in my grade to mature. From "Thats what she said" to "Your mom". Its just a normal part of school. Almost eveyone goes through it. Your not alone|`|zGdyJbYUaa	Guys your age are just immature. Get used to it there stupid right now lol just ignore and tell them to screw off|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You are going to encounter bullies all throughout your life. Bullying doesn't end in elementary school, when you start a job and later get into a career you will find bullies in the workplace. The best way to manage these situations is to make the person in charge (your principal and teachers) aware of the problem but without whining. Say you are having problems with a group of students and you would like some intervention. Also, this is a good time for you to learn how to cope with bullies without becoming one yourself or becoming too scared to function. Find a good group of friends and be a united front against the bullies, a strong support system is the best defense you can have. Learn to talk about your feelings and get out your frustrations. Learning to ignore and not react to a bully's taunts is another strong quality to acquire. Most bullies are just looking for the most responsive (and therefore, fun to torment) victim. Not giving in is a good way to get them off your back.|`|623zz8d7aa	Go to the school counselor on Monday anf get some advice. There is no reason why you should have to endure this idiocy from a bunch of boys. They sound like real losers.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Sadly, yes it's normal. Millions of kids are bullied around your age. I've been a victim when I was only thirteen years old.    You should ignore them. If they make a rude comment to you, just smile :) Kindness kills! If it worsens, tell your principal.|`|agTCqkLDaa	I got bullied from Kindergarten through 12th grade, so yeah, they're just a bunch of jerks.  Ignore them.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	Yes, it is normal. I was also bullied by boys, as well as girls, when I was your age. I found that ignoring it rarely worked and I usually confronted the person and it almost always stopped. Once they knew that I wasn't afraid of them, they found other prey to pick on.     I don't mean to walk up and start anything, that rarely works, I mean saying something like..."why are you talking about me, I haven't done anything to you. I have no problem with you and you shouldn't have a problem with me." this even worked on really "scary" people. Just be reasonable and non confrontational.|`|c55O7jqXaa	It could very well be that one or more of them like you. This is what guys do at this age. They always pick on the ones they like and let me tell you they continue up into Highschool unfortuntely and the bulling with the girls usually starts too. Every guy tat ever picked on me I found out later had a crush on me. Now mind you I was pretty girl, but not overally beautiful or popular. Actually I was more of a bookworm and hung out with my average looking freinds.     Just ignore them. They are so immature and don't grow up into they get well into their 30's and 40's-haha. No joking.
0sqRwzcfaa	i would never ever name my son that in a million years but if you want my opion i think they stink like a dirty diaper|`|6cu3RwBcaa	I had the same idea. Mix the names up.

How about Ayden Shay?|`|y4Uliyq3aa	I Love this spelling of Ayden! Shuford Is Unique and very Interesting...I like It.    I really Love the name Samuel but I don't like It paired with Michael.

God Bless~  Morgan Leilani|`|TYl7kmPeaa	the first one is so much more out there than the second  maybe switch them up  like ayden michael and samuel shuford  sounds better to me|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I like them both.  Good choices!|`|EJJMXnf0aa	Samuel Michael|`|Gge8MNTKaa	What about Aiden Michael? That sounds very appealing.|`|SUBqk9WQaa	The first names are great! However, Shuford will lead to teasing down the road for him in school.  It not like it is a bad name kids just think it is different.|`|627pWyVkaa	im sorry I dont really like the shuford, I think he would be made fun of for it, and it sounds like a weird last name, not a middle name.....
AA11227706	I haven't had experience with it myself, but just about any car is "safe" if you are responsible and handle it correctly.  For example, no car is safe if you are going 100 mph.  So if you are as trustworthy as you say, you should be fine.    Since you are a new driver though, I don't think you should go out and buy a car (even if it's used).  Maybe your parents can lend you their car and they can get a new car for themselves.  Maybe after a couple years of responsible driving, you can get a new car of your own, but not less than a year of getting your license.

AA11021960	AAAHHHH... Don't scratch!!!!!  Yes, it makes it way worse.  Stretch marks are essentially tears in your skin, you can make them worse by scratching.  When you itch, get a dry washcloth and fold it square (so two folds, half then half again)... lay your hand flat on it and gently rub back and forth... it will help to scratch without damaging your skin.  Also, anytime it itches, lotion lotion lotion.    Good Luck Hun!!!!  Congrats on your upcoming lil one!!!!!   :)|`|jNqf8HtDaa	keep using cocoa butter and after the baby is born you can buy some other stuff to help clear them up but i dont know if it takes them away fully or just mostly|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	No, scratching won't make them worse, and it is pretty normal because they can be really itchy. Keep moisturizing like you are doing, try to find some cream with vitamin E in it. They will fade a lot after your baby is born.|`|INkafu0uaa	yes it does try rubbing when it itches or slapping the area and it should feel better!

It is VERY unlikely i would say if you want a real percent you would have to know her cycle. Let me ask you  this have you thought about having her go on the pill ring or patch. than you wont have to worry about anything but STD's. Remember you can not feel precum hun and it only takes one of your lil guys to make a baby. My friend did the same thing all the time now she has a 4 year old. Just try and not worry and go to planed parenthood. they also sell plan B for around $50 sounds like alot but it cost more for diapers and wipes in the first month after birth. my advice would be     Buy plan B at any drug store. (up to 72 hrs after unprotected sex) you need to be 18 or have some one who is 18 buy it for you.    go talk to plan parent hood. they will examine her and give her free pills and she does not need a parent.    than get yourself tested for STD's just because she looks cleadoesn'tnt mean she cant have anything.     Stay safe and good luck.|`|801022f65fca3e71187b34a99f036a2baa	Hard to say what the percentage of pregnancy from pull-outs is.  That's a hard thing for doctors to study.     What you should know is that pre-*** and semen do have sperm in it and it only takes one sperm and one egg to make a baby.     Next time you want to try that, use some spermicide jelly.|`|zif7kxswaa	not sure if there is an exact percentage. it really just depends on if any sperm was able to get through. which is not likely but still possible. then you would have to be ovulating. which is about a 3 in 30 chance, and on top of that you only have about a 20-30% chance of actually conceiving a child if all the circumstances are just right. hope this helps. maybe you should consider birth control. as not even condoms are effective 100% of the time. good luck.

ahDUOe48aa	maybe because i got pregnant on provera not depo so its possible|`|6L9jJnchaa	I got pregnancy symptoms all the time while I was on depo, and even worse when I got off of it (withdrawls)    So I would say it's most likely just the overdose of hormones.  (Depo is like 5 times what you actually need for effective birth control, unfortunatly.)

3klIx1Egaa	try putting a clock near her basinett *one of the ones that tick* or a watch under her bedding, the ticking reminds them of heart beats, and usually calms them down and helps them sleep.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if u r swaddling with a blanket; try a 'swaddle me' by kiddopotamus; ten bucks at brus and they are wonderful, snug, and they don't come loose..where does she nap? perhaps put the bassinet in the room u r in during the day and let her nap there....so maybe she would be more comfy there at night...but def buy the swaddler, they are worth their weight in gold! make sure her needs are met, she is dressed to be warm/cool enough , etc.....she's too young to cio....hth|`|XzV4bUeFaa	She like the feel of your chest and heart rythym.  Heart rythym is what a baby hears inutero.  However, you must get her to sleep in own bed.  While she is in the bassinet, tap her gently on her bottom or rub her back.  It is NOT good for her to sleep on your chest while you are lying down and sleeping also.  This could make her fall or there is a chance that  you could roll over onto her while in deep sleep.  This could be fatal to baby.  It has happened before.  I know someone who recently had her baby fall to floor from her chest when sleeping.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Are you serious...you let your newborn cry for 20 minutes..that is just wrong! She wants you...sleep with her....put you bed against the wall and let her sleep in your bed..I co-sleep and never rolled on my baby and she has never fallen off you have mommy insticts..she will be fine!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Not to worry! The baby is very happy on chest to hear heartbeat. I sleep with all my kids until they were weaned. I can still remember a winter baby that slept on my chest next to the wood stove, and we were under a wool blanket, because of the draft on the floor, and I had to chuckle to myself because we must have looked like Eskimos.   Forget the bassinet. Put a doll in it.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Hi, first of all congrats and welcome to hell year!  (I have 5 kids.. :)    I'm going to give you something to worry about, but it's not a big worry, just something you should have checked out, ok?  This is not normal for a little baby to not sleep in a lying down position, she MIGHT be in pain with her ears.  I found out the hard way, went through the same damn thing with my second child, turns out every time he laid down his ears would start to hurt and he was screaming about 30 minutes into it every time.  We had tubes put in his ears at 10 weeks and he slept through the night every single night after that, in his crib!  But until then?  I was sitting up with a kid on my chest every night.    5th child, same thing, only he had a hernia that hurt like hell every time he laid down flat!  That was diagnosed early but we had to wait until he was 8 weeks old to do the surgery, and I was in the chair every single night for 8 weeks holding a curled up, vertical baby!  Watyagonnado, right?  :)    To make it safe for both of you until you can get the pediatrician to check her ears and everything else out, sit in a chair with a pillow on either side of you to prop you up so you don't drop her, or worse yet, slightly drop her and occlude her breathing.    Don't let her cry it out, no matter what anyone tells you, that's cruel to you both, and dammit, the kid has an issue, she's hardly a spoiled brat at one week old, ok?? :)  Off to the doctor you go, get her a good check up and see what's wrong.|`|SjX72fPyaa	My daughter was doing that at first too. The first few nights home she didn't have a problem with the bassinet then all of a sudden she couldn't stand sleeping in it! As long as your checking everything else, hungry, wet, etc. she might just find the mattress uncomfortable.   We waited it out for the first 2 or 3 weeks and then finally decided to see if she would sleep in her crib in her own room and it worked like a charm!! By the time she was about 2 months she was sleeping through most of the night and now shes a perfect sleeper at 4 months.   So I'd suggest trying her in her crib and if your not comfortable with her being in her own room yet move the crib into yours.   I have noticed that the crib mattresses seem a bit more comfortable then bassinet ones :)|`|8Jaxpop4aa	Your baby looks like one of those reborn,rebirth babydolls......|`|0cx4imxHaa	I've been there. My baby would not sleep in her bassinet, mostly due to gas, which made her uncomfortable. We used a "snuggle nest" in our bed, between us for awhile. That way she was next to me but I wasn't worried about my husband rolling over on her. It sounds like your baby is being comforted by your scent/heartbeat. I would just give it some time.     The first 3 months of a baby's life is like the 4th trimester. At around 3 months, they begin to realize they are separate from you. Before that, they still think they are part of you. So as hard as it seems right now, it will get easier. My baby is now sleeping in her crib just fine but we co-slept for the first 3 months. Good luck!|`|u9sGH0AXaa	First of all...how would you feel to be say....on another planet, not knowing anything around you and having no way of communicating other than your cry?  Wouldn't you want someone familiar to come to you and hold you?  I know if I were screaming for 20 minutes, I would get very tired and extremely scared.  This is what your newborn baby is going through.      Id your baby is crying that much, there is a reason.  She's cold/hot, dirty, over tired, gassy...its something.  They are too young to just let cry, all it will do is make them feel abandoned and scared.      As a first time mom myself, I would never let my daughter cry for 20 min without going to her.  But, it's really up to you.  I'm not judging, honestly.  I know you are probably SO tired, believe me I was just there.      Try everything you can.  Go down the list.  My baby falls asleep as soon as we start the car, or sometimes when I take her into the bathroom and run the sink, she calms down.  You could sing to her, giver her a paci.      Good luck!|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I havent had that problem but a friend of my husband's mom said that he would not sleep in a crip or bassenette. She had to make him a pallet on the floor and let him sleep on the floor. It was the only thing that worked. Sounds to me that your daughter wants to be really close. I know my daughter wanted to sleep on me when I was in the hospital after having her. I was scared because I didnt want her to fall off and hit the concrete floor. I wouldnt sleep because of the thought. The nurse came in and asked me if I have slept and I told her no and why. She told me that Its ok to sleep with her that my mother instinct will prevent her from moving off of my chest. I got enough confidence to try it and she was right. When I woke up my daughter was in the same spot she was when I went to sleep. We slept a good 5 hours. I would try letting her fall asleep on you and give her a good 5 or 10 minutes to get good and asleep and put her on a pallet on the floor. If that doesnt work try putting her on your bed and put a pillow on the outside of her so that she dont happen to fall off the bed. I had to do that with my daughter when we first brought her home because she would wake up screaming from her bassenette and then I found out the bassenette was to cold because it was on the floor. So I had to put it on its stand and put a flannel blanket in there. Good luck and I hope you get some kind of relief.      Oh btw I never layed my daughter on her back. I was scared that she was going to spit up and not be able to get it out of her mouth. My daughter layed on her side. If you do choose to do that make sure she alternates sides every night so that she dont develop a flat spot on one side like my daughter did. I would roll up a recieving blanket and put it behind her so that she wouldnt roll over to her back. I didnt trust putting her on her back or tummy.. Good Luck!|`|G6eBvDz8aa	Tonight is my first night home with my newborn and I am having the same issue, well, did in the hospital.. So I know what you're going through but I just wanted to give kudos to the lady who recommended about putting the watch under the matress.. that's a seriously GREAT idea!!  and I might use it tonight! hahhaah :)|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	Someone answered a similar question once by suggesting that you use your pillowcase (like the one that's on your bed right now, not a clean one) as the sheet in the bassinet so your scent is close to her.  I did not try it, so I can't say if it works or not, but it sounded like an easy enough thing to try...|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	It can be hard for babies to adjust to life outside of the womb. In the womb they hear your heartbeating and the swooshing of your bloodflowing. It was also dark and warm. As they get larger its also comforting because they are held tightly in your belly. Then they are born and all of that is gone. There are bright lights, loud noises, cold are and whole new array of feelings. It can be scary!     My son wouldn't sleep in his bed either (still doesn't!) and the only way we got any sleep was to let him sleep with us. Eventually he slept in his bassinet but you have to keep trying it.. she will get used to it, but you have to keep trying. I slept belly to belly, head in crook of my arm with my son.     There is some evidence (Dr. Sears study I think) that suggests that co-sleeping (when done safely) actually reduces the chance of SIDS. The baby will imitate the mother's breathing patterns and the mother is much more attuned to the child's movemenst and needs. (I was always able to get my son a bottle before he started crying because he would wake me up by punching me before he was upset enough to scream, for example) It is a habit that is hard to break though, like I said my son still sleeps with us, but it works for us (we have a big, low bed too which also helps)    If she will only sleep with you, then do that so you can get some sleep. Keep trying to put her in her bad though. Put her down with a full tummy, swaddled and while she is drowsy but still awake. When she falls asleep on your chest and then suddenly wakes up somewhere else, it can be upsetting. Also, some parents find that laying a heating pad on the mattress for a few minutes before laying the baby down can help, the baby is soothed by the warmth (be sure to remove it and turn it off before laying baby down).    It will take time, but it will happen eventually.    Good Luck! Sounds like you are doing a good job!|`|F2RFHOmjaa	First I just want to say congrats.  I know what your going through, and let me tell you that there is hope.    With my first child, he refused to sleep in the bassinet after two weeks so I put him in bed with me (dangerous, but I did it) and he would sleep all through the night.  But then I learned that is was harder to for both of us when transitioning him to his crib.  With my second child, he would not sleep in his bassinet from day one, so we put him in his car seat.  I made sure that his head was supported on both sides, buckled him, and covered him with a blanket.  Not only did he sleep through the night, but it helped him to breath.  We did this until he was about 5 months old, and then put him in his crib from then on.    Your baby hears your heartbeat when sleeping on your chest, which is why she is most comfortable.  But its a hard habit to break, for both of you.  Is she getting enough to eat before going to bed? Is she gassy? If none of those, try letting her sleep in the car seat.  Dr's will tell you its ok, and it helps with there breathing.  Relax mom, things will get easier and you will learn as you go....good luck!
Rhr1umV1aa	I used those when my husband and I were trying to conceive our second child. I never got a positive the whole month that I used them. We finally just said that we are going to stop "trying". Just have fun. lol. Then my brother in law and his wife got pregnant. He told us to wait exactly 8 days after the first day of your period. Then have sex. So we tried that and now I am 34 weeks pregnant. Hope this helps. Worked for us.
56q4sy3Haa	I'm sorry you're not feeling well. Try some plain toast, it might help settle your stomach. Pasta is good too, maybe with an alfredo or creamy mushroom sauce. Ginger cookies or fruit tea with pieces of fresh ginger in it might help you feel better too. <br>  I know you said crackers taste weird, but maybe try some plain Tuc crackers with cheddar cheese and a few grapes or strawberries.<br>  Hope this helps! x|`|bTXsr5JWaa	I'm finding that this happens to me, also.  I have always loved cheese and mayo, and since I've been pregnant,  I haven't been able to cope with it.<br>  <br>  Eat plain foods low in fat, such as chicken, or if you prefer not to eat meat like me, a bean and vegetable stew or lentil soup might help.  I also find that mild curry and rice, or a plain pasta and tomato dish helps me to eat.<br>  <br>  The foods that you have been trying so far sound quite heavy and high in sat fat, which isn't good for pregnancy related nausea.<br>  <br>  I find that currently, if I eat something that seems a bit iffy, it comes back up in the toilet, and it's more likely to if I eat it in the morning.|`|zdWDkadraa	Up until just recentlIy couldn't eat most things either. Even just preparing food for my husband, or grocery shopping totally disgusted me. My Dr. said to just eat as much as I could, whatever that was.<br>  <br>  For me that was cheese and crackers, fruit, smoothies, or toast with peanut butter and honey. That's all I ate for a couple months.

I was on the pill for 3 years and sometimes I didnt get any bleeding. <br>  <br>  If hwever you missed a pill or took one late then you could be pregnant.

9CoTDEKVaa	Symptoms of being pregnant and side effects from your period are almost the same. Bloating, sore boobs and etc, that could also be due to your period coming. If your having unprotected sex, then yes, you could be pregnant. If your period is late, take a test. And don't stress yourself out because that delays your period. Good luck!|`|s8APstrVaa	it may just be because your going to start your period.  If you don't get your period right away wait until after a week then take a test.|`|HZbSbZIraa	depends on if you had unproteceted sex first of all and also your preiod signs/ syptoms are almost identical and very very simillar to pregnancy syptoms ! but if you dont get your period and your about a week late than take a preg test
WbJPQM1naa	First, physically, you can help by staying on your feet, or squatting.      I would check your mind set too.  If there is some psychological or emotional things going on for you, or fears you might have, these can be hindering your ability to open up for your baby.  So, really think about what might be holding you back, emotionally and release that fear!  Talk to your partner or even journal it.  Or just write it down and burn it or tear it up and flush it down the toilet!  You'de be amazed at how helpful this exercise can be in releasing pent up emotions!    Now, before things pick up to take as much rest as you can. Drink plenty of fluids and maybe eat a little something protein rich to help you keep your metabolism and blood sugar stable.  Relax, listen to music, sing! .. laugh (there is a direct connection physiologically between your throat and your cervix.  Opening up your throat muscles will help you open up there too)  take a nice hot soak and just BREATH and relax everything.  Have your partner pour water over your belly during your rushes(another word for contractions).      Don't allow your fears to overtake your ability to have this baby!  YOU CAN and will give birth, just as millions of women before you have!  YOU are ABLE and your body is perfectly formed for this task!  So, relax and let nature do what it's meant to do!    Good luck and Many Blessings... CONGRATS,  You will be a mommy soon!

IXBl5l5kaa	I am PRESCRIBED iron and am breastfeeding. I think the best thing for you to do is get your levels checked. I have mine checked every so often because I have hypothyroidism so standard procedure is to check for anemia.    You can buy iron pills otc but they are not FDA approved. I would definitely get a prescription.    Eat lots of protein (peanut butter, but make sure it wasn't recalled lol). When I was pregnant, especially, protein helped with weak/dizzy spells      ***Agreed, a prenatal vitamin should be continued while nursing. I take prenatals and additional iron pills, however.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Yes it's safe. I was prescribed a fairly high dose of iron (slow fe) after giving birth to my first child. But it's best to speak with your OB first, and get a blood test done. I lost a lot of blood having my son, and ended up with a low white blood cell count and very low blood pressure.    I felt like you-Very weak. Every time I stood up I would get lightheaded. Also I became very pale, like I lost all the color in my skin. I was told this was a sign of low iron levels.    EDIT: I don't eat meat either! Iron was never a problem for me until I gave birth.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I would ask your doctor if you can take iron pills. I would probably try a multi vitamin or see about taking flinstone vitamins with iron. That is what I had to take when I was pregnant is the flinstone vitamins. I couldnt keep prenatals down. So a friend told me to try taking flinstone vitamins and to make sure they are the ones with iron. Because they have the same things in them as prenatals. I had to take 2 one for me and one for the baby is how I looked at it. My doctor said that it was perfectly fine. I would ask your doctor about it to see if there will be any effects from your breastmilk. Like if its safe for your child to get any. Good Luck!!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	After i had my son i lost 650ml of blood - i was put on iron pills that also had vitamin C in them - i took them for at least a month, and was breastfeeding. Nothing happened to my child, but until you see a doctor - have lots of red meat, cooked so it is just pink inside and eat lots of green veggies - they are also great sources of iron.  * It might sound gross - get some cooked veggies and some cooked meat and blend it all up together and eat it.  That way you have it all there, like make it in a big mixed mashed potato or something. I tore badly aswell, but i love eating veggies so when my doctor said to do that and meat - that was pretty much for me just to amp up the meat consumption etc.  Carrots also have iron in them, as does brocoli, beans, peas and spinach.|`|DnBMRRXaaa	i just had my son on Tuesday and am anemic. the doc. gave me a prescription for iron so i would say yes you can take it but make sure you do check with both doctors  ...my doctor does know i am breast feeding also|`|0cx4imxHaa	I think its normal to have less energy, especially if you are breastfeeding. Are you eating a lot? I was eating a lot more than usual just to make it through the day. But if you have a history of anemia, I would suspect that first.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u need to talk to your doc, possibly have your blood drawn to see if you are anemic; esp if you are still bleeding heavily; they will be able to suggest a safe way to take care of things.  for the record teenybeeny, your wbc has nothing to do with anemia; anemia is a lowered hemoglobin /hematocrit or red blood cells, not white, which is needed to transport oxygen throughout your body..i wish ppl knew what they were talking about when they answered these questions, it would make it much less confusing if  you don't know to just not answer...|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	have you triedd a prenatal vitamin- even so iron should be fine but you don't want too much iron and overdose|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Ask your physician. Your baby is too valuable to get medical advise from a post.    OK then. Iron pills made me extremely sick when I had my anemia. I was in bed for several months and the pills made me extremely sick. I dont know how it will affect the baby since it causes problems in lots of adult that take them. What I did to get rid of my anemia was to eat iron rich food. Like broccoli, cauligreen and beef. There are many more. You can actually get a list of those from a nutritionist. Also drinks lots of vitamin C to help your body absorbed the iron. You can also take vitamins instead of iron supplement. I took centrum just in case I was missing other stuff in my diet. But speak to you health care provider about your options. Some food actually prevent your body from absorbing the iron.     Check out the links below. One woman had the same problem as you and asked that question on yahoo before. Just be extremely careful some doctors love to prescribe medication without thinking. It seems like too much iron can cause problems in babies. You might have to get a shot and stop breastfeeding according to that yahoo answer.      There are plenty of vegetable that can help you. You dont have to eat meat if you dont like it.    ss|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Better ask the doctor.  It's okay to give your baby iron, since there are tons of formulas on the shelf that are iron fortified.  The problem with them is they make the baby constipated upset their stomachs.  If you take it, will it go through your milk, upset the baby or cause constipation?  I don't know.  Better ask.    Are you eating well?  If you can, have iron-fortified waffles or cereal for breakfast.  Sleeping as much as you can?    Best wishes,  TX Mom|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Iron pills can sometimes make U sick and constipate the baby. Best to get iron from natural sources like food. Dark green leafy vegetables (kale) and some seaweeds can really help. Read up on diet. Beets and beet greens are helpful, and there are lots of other foods too.
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Well it depends. Did you also ovulate on 1/25.  If so than it is possible that it was implantation, it usually happens about 5-10 days after ovulation. However it is actually rare to have implantation bleeding.  It doesn't happen to everyone. The best thing you can do is wait it out. Then when you are late test. It could also be break though bleeding which can happen at any point within your cycle. So just stay calm and relaxed and wait it out..|`|SBj7fhNvaa	Well im no expert but I read that implantation bleeding (if it occurs) usually occurs between the 6th and 12th day of your cycle!  Good Luck|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Probably not this soon.  I experienced implantation bleeding but it occurred right when my period was due.  I actually thought I had started my period, but then I quickly realized it wasn't.  Most of the time the fertilized egg needs about 10-12 days to fully implant successfully.  This is the reason doctors will ask about your luteal phase if having trouble ttc.  A very short luteal phase (less than 10 days) can be a cause of infertility because the egg does not have time to implant correctly and ends up being flushed out with AF.
PFO1jxZGaa	well 30 degreees is fine for an hour or two but for the whole night even an adult would most likely suffer some type of hypothermia... Maybe if she drives around every hour or so to warm up the car... She doesnt have money to stay in a motel etc..? The husband could take her baby away from her ( as being she is an unfit parent letting her baby sleep in a car when he has a house) . I'm not saying its right but he could try... Hope it works out but a car is no place for a baby to be sleeping in 30 degree weather.|`|M6c0hUefaa	I'd rather be out of my commute area than sleep in a 30 degree car with my 3 month old. She obviously doesn't have many options, BUT she needs to use the ones she has and although I don't have medical proof it's bad. Once you sit in a 30 degree car for more than an hour you start to feel a little more than chilled.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	hypothermia|`|h59Bc4wfaa	You're too close, and your other friends are too far from work, so she's going to put her baby in a car to sleep? Selfish much? No I don't know any sites or books, but I do have common sense.|`|rAkWoweOaa	If it snows and the snow happens to cover the exhaust pipe, they will both die from carbon monoxide poisoning. I saw on the news where 3 young girls died like that.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Take her by the local police station and ask them to explain to her why it's not ok.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Tell her she can go but the baby is staying end of story. If she trys to take the baby thats when you call the cops and tell them what she is going to do.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Well I don't have any info on the cold weather, sorry. But why don't you get a hotel room? Yes it is expensive, but there are always cheap motels along a major highway. I think the cost is worth it. I will pray for your friend.    Sleeping with a car running does introduce the chance of carbon monoxide poisoning.|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	Call children's protective services. That is ridiculous, the baby is in serious danger.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	call the police, she cant do that! the baby will die. Any website about adults sleeping a tthe temp the same goes for babies but even worse because they cant regulate their temperature.  Seriosuly call the police, explain the situation, they can help, my cousin was in a similar situation and came to my house but it was very close to her husband and she knew he would come here so we called the police, they helped get a protective order and got her to a safe place and watched out house closely the first night becuase she did stay with us for one night.|`|YbnMcP9yaa	Tell her her heart should be saying it is good to put the baby in the car like that. Can you care for the baby during the day? What a sad situation.|`|sr1niZlTaa	for one, all it would take is a simple call to DCS and that abusive husband would have that baby back in NO TIME.  If she has no evidence that he's abusive, and DCS finds an infant sleeping in a car, no matter what the weather, that baby is G O N E.  So, that alone should get her to stay with you.  I mean if she stays with you she's behind closed doors.  If she's staying in a car, what's protecting her and her child?  A WINDSHIELD.  If she's in an abusive relationship ( emotional or physical ) she's probably really frazzled and/or flustered.   Maybe she needs somebody to grab this situation by the horns, if you are comfortable protecting her or know people who can offer protection to her than play HER mommy and insist that she do it.  Some people need a leader in situations like this.  Follow your heart-  and get that baby out of the cold!  Best of luck!    ;]meg|`|tnKhIUK1aa	I do not know the websites, but I am an RN and do know that babies  temperatures can get down quicker than an adults because of the percentage of water in their bodies being higher than an adults.  The baby can quickly go into hypothermia and die....She better not do this...Also CPS. (child protection services) could be called because this is considered neglect and she could lose her child to foster care.  You do not want to deal with them....trust me...It is almost impossible to fight them once they are involved.  One has to hire an attorney to fight them and there are very few attorneys that will fight the government for someone that has no money.  If she is going to be living in her car---I will guess that she has very little money.  The free legal help also does not fight Social Services when it comes to Child Protection.  It will cost thousands of dollars to hire an attorney to get her child back if at all.  She may lose her child forever and the child would be put in a foster home and the mom will be evaluated by the courts for mental stability and also possibly charged with child neglect.  It is not fair, but this is how our government works on these issues.  She should go to an abused Women's Shelter or the Mission and insist on getting a spot or have a relative or close friend take the child temporarily, if that is possible.  As a very last resort, then ask Social Services for help, but keep in mind that the child will be put into foster care and it may be difficult to get the child back.  Our courts could be corrupt and things get twisted when a child is concerned. Her best bet is to get into an abused women's shelter.  Kids are allowed and they help you get the necessary links to get on your feet. She needs to be persistent in this...It is a matter of life or death....but her baby could die from hypothermia. (core temperature getting too low).  Babies get this very quickly compared to adults...She needs to think of her baby first and keep the baby safe...Also she will be charged with neglect and possibly go to jail...Yes, it is not fair, but it is the truth...|`|claW4UUcaa	tell her your concern. she should stay with you. that's crazy to sleep outside when it's that cold. god bless.
a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Olivia or Rachel the best.    Olivia Rachel Yang would go nicely. Good luck|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Nothing ending in lyn because it sounds too much like ying-yang.  Rachel Yang has a really good ring to it and is not too common.|`|xA7lxyLdaa	I like Kia, it sound unique, and I also like Rachel. Maybe you could also think of different ways to spell it, like Rachelle or something a little more unusual because practically every third person is named Rachel. It's still a cute name, though even if you spell it the normal way. Hope that helped! :)|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i love all of them to tell you the truth  but my favorites are adelyn and olivia  they are reallyyy pretty|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Kia|`|jOBJPzmOaa	Olivia & Kia are very Cute!|`|DP48dIxhaa	Madelyn is my fav. I like Rachel and Becca 2! I don't really like the others..|`|0hxK0khKaa	I like Olivia and Madelyn. I'd go with Olivia Yang...No middle name? Olivia Rachel maybe?|`|SI6Y8Au1aa	olivia|`|J2gr1ogHaa	Adelyn, Addy is a great nickname!  my 2nd pick is Madelyn, but prefer the spelling Madeleine|`|10YksH8caa	Olivia!|`|010478ea090db9976afeb8170939dea9aa	I like Adelyn because it sounds unique. I've heard all the other names a lot before.|`|gWCXXHEmaa	well personally i think that Jamie Yang is cool  but out of those names I would say Rachel|`|MSfuRuqCaa	I like Adelyn. It has a nice ring to it plus its unique..|`|nlNNmBbRaa	adelyn - pretty but strong, and also a bit individual and unique but nothing that would cause teasing. adelyn yang also has a nice ring to it.    becca - i think is a bit childish so when she is an adult it may not be so good.    olivia - is ok but pretty common.    kia - is cute but i prefer names a bit longer than that. it reminds me of the car brand.    madelyn - is also very pretty, but i think its also a bit common and adelyn puts a different spin on the popular name.    rachel - i love this name but it reminds me a bit of a soap opera character. like rachel on neighbours or friends.     good luck with the names xxx|`|SBj7fhNvaa	Rachel or Olivia|`|kVWWHiLIaa	I like the name Kia. Its different and sounds cool|`|Ir0dKh3iaa	They are all very nice.    1. Becca - it's weird if her full name is Rebecca...and Becca is the nickname. It's really common but pretty as well.   2. Adelyn - this is the only one i dont like.  3. Olivia - really common as well but cute and ages well.  4. Kia - i personally think its the best...its different, feminine and pretty  5. Madelyn - my second favorite. I love the spelling and it's a great name!!  6. Rachel - way tooo common for my liking.    I suggest Kia or Madelyn they are definitely the best!!!|`|81swnmpyaa	Rachel Yang sounds the best!|`|BY0IqbLgaa	rachel is used alot,   so i would go with Olivia|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I luv Becca.  Also Kia.  Those would be my  l and 2 choices.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Olivia Yang
xukz46NFaa	I would tend to think that your 2 yr old is maybe getting too much sleep during the day. My son when he skips his daytime nap can go to bed at about 7pm and sleep all night til about 6-7am... but if he naps wont go to bed till about 10pm and then wakes once crying for awhile. Try shortening the nap time to under an hour, if he is pushing close to 2 hours...    Ultimately you want to try to cut his nap out completely by age 36-40 months of age....  i am slowly now weening my 3 yr old away from the long naps. If he naps over an hour I have many troubles at night.|`|627pWyVkaa	Try giving him his nap in the day time earlier, and limit it to half the time he normally sleeps (dont just let him sleep forever how long he wants too) and Physical activity is really important for anyone, during the day, try to wear him out, Maybe get your 8 year old to run around the yard or house with him for a good hour or so and it will help wear him out. Also make sure to limit food and drink intake before bed.    trust me he does not have insomnia. I have it, and its pretty rare a child would have it. and insomnia is the lack of not getting any sleep for days, he is sleeping during the day, You may have to stop the nap all together so he will sleep at night. Its not insomnia hes exhausted by the time you put him down for a nap and thats where he is getting his sleep.|`|eya1WDS4aa	So whats the question>? take him to the doctor.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	He may be sleeping too much during the day -- naps too long -- or naps too close to bedtime.  He may need some exercise time late afternoon then a warm bath before bedtime.|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Try not napping him during the day. I know he is only 2yrs old and thats tough, especailly when they get tired and start crying. Or tire him out before bed, play games, chase him around, anything active. When he does awake keep lights low. try giving him a bottle.
3cLE5L7Saa	At first I had morning sickness so every morning I would feel icky and puke and then I'd be fine most of the day...I didn't "feel" like i wasn't myself...then as my belly started to grow I still felt great and didn't feel any different.  NOW I'm 9 months pregnant, and I have a baby inside me kicking my ribs, hiccuping, rolling around, making my back and ribs hurt, making it hard to sleep at night, I have to change my underwear all the time from discharge.  My stomach feels stretched (no stretchmarks though yay!)....I definitely FEEL pregnant, and it sucks, I never want to do it again!  Some women like it though.  Its different for everybody.  I can't wait until he comes out, I can't believe I've made it this far either.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	it depends on the person. your health, the babies health your size, etc. some women dont even feel pregnant. others are sick the whole time. its one of those things you must experience.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	At first you feel funny sometimes sick. Then in your 2nd you start to feel great but your belly starts to grow and it keeps growing and the more it grows the more back pains you get and the more uncomfortable you are.  You also feel your baby move and it is amazing and the best part of being pregnant in my opinion.     You have to get some blood test done and you see the doctor a lot.      It can be painful at times but mostly it is uncomfortable.    Thats how pregnancy was for me.  It is not the same for everyone.|`|895XRbnJaa	at first i didn't feel anything, the only symptom i had was that i didn't get my period and then at about 12 weeks i started to feel pain in my stomach muscles, it was my body starting to stretch, then at about 16 weeks i felt little flutters in my tummy which was the baby moving then the movements got stronger and stronger and now i can see my belly moving. so really the only pain i had was when my belly first started to stretch oh and braxton hicks can be painful i got those pretty early but i dint get them anymore.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	First trimester for me - horrible nonstop nausea, painful pimples you cant put any medicine on, and horrible back ache.     Second trimester - about 3 weeks of feeling great and eating everything in sight, then a suddenly swollen belly, swollen ankles, trouble walking, cant bend over, having to pee nonstop and urgently, then having trouble getting up from a chairs, waddling starts, feet swell.     Third trimester - cant tell ya yet I'm only 24 weeks lol|`|66d8ae5cc5237739b8cad6fb682d6dc1aa	Everyone's  pregnancy is different ,but it shouldn't be painful.

I loved being pregnant.  It is the most awesome feeling knowing that you have this little life inside of you.  Once I had my baby girl I missed her being inside of me.  I mean it is great that she is here and all and I love holding her and kissing her, but I really miss being pregnant.  It was the most amazing thing ever!! You have to be pregnant to be able to understand what I am saying, but its great.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	not so painful as it is wanting to throw up all the time....     it is worth it
xJW1RSaAaa	All pregnancies are as different as the child or children that you are carrying. Just try and relax and enjoy the last moments of this pregnancy and let nature take its course.

vOFdHvlvaa	I would say at least 2, but 3 may be better, i ordered from diapers.com too, and i got 4 big cases of size newborn and size 1's to start out with, and he went through them really fast, so the more the better, well as long as u don't go over board and then don't get to use alotta them.  So def. get at least 2 and prolly no more than 3.  Good choices on diapers, BTW, i love pampers, only kinda diapers i'll use for my son.  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|claW4UUcaa	i have no clue! with my first daughter she didn't even use a case of newborns but with my second daughter we used two cases a jumbo pack and the little pack they give you at the hospital. i would buy a jumbo pack and buy cases of ones and twos. don't forget the wipes!    congrats!!|`|mn8tFuhoaa	i would order only 1 case because babies grow so fast and then you'll have to give the pampers away.. i suggest you just buy 1 case.. good luck..you should also order a box of size 2.. it will be helpful.. also dont forget the sensitive swaddlers baby wipes soft for baby skin..|`|aff12ee9c8750e4530d3ac705c705347aa	My son was in Newborn diapers for about a month and Stage 1 diapers for about 2 months. I wouldn't order more than one case for now. If your child outgrows those diapers you have no way of returning them. If possible, I would just set the money aside you're trying to spend on diapers and when the baby comes you'll have a decent amount of money to spend on diapers. Also, if you're having a shower, you might get diapers, so like I said, save your money instead.|`|pk8Oemycaa	Just one for now, she will grow out of them very quick.

So probably 1|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	it mostly will depend on the size of your baby, but to be completely honest, i would NOT buy boxes of anything smaller than a 2. I had a tiny girl who was 6 pounds 11 oz and so thin at first that she wore preemie clothing, and we only used NB sizes for 3 weeks. When she got into Size 1 i figured we would use them for a while and bought a handful of packages of them--- but lo and behold she FLEW through them and into size two within a few more weeks. I had to return 5 packages between what I had and my grandma had. And size two went the same way. She has been in size three since she was 13 pounds, and it says 16 pounds on the package.     the point being... you don't know how big you baby will be, how fast they will grow, and whether they diapers are going to fit the way they say they will. you never ever know- you might want to use pampers and find that they are just not working for you (although i know swaddlers ARE great for most people, i'm sure there are people who find they prefer huggies gentle care [which i know i discovered too late and wish i had earlier since they are cheaper and work just as well] or another kind of diaper) plus they normally will go through NB sizes SO fast it's kind of silly to buy boxes of NB. some babies are born too big for NB to begin with.     I would get one or two packages and then play it by ear.  If you wanna buy boxes I would get maybe ONE box of size one, and then a few of size two. if you need more ones you can get them, but you know you at least have a few size twos on hand when you need them.     i wish someone had told me these things before i started getting diapers because it was more annoying to have to return all the smaller diapers that it would have been to just get more if i needed them, or stock up on the ones that i really need- size threes and up.|`|7fd087382fbb2c34d1c9ed80fc569c6faa	i would say a few. i didnt buy cases i only bought small packs thinking i would not need very many newborn diapers but i was wrong i have used about 80 diapers in 9 days lol i have not heard of diapers that had that big of a range of size most have newborn than size one. cause newborn diapers have a little u shape at the top for there belly button cause the diaper cant cover it while the umbilical cord is still on there. but ya i would get at least 2 or 3. u can never have to many though .|`|dTLTNZTzaa	1 in newborn size. My daughter did not even get to use all the box - they were too tight for her, so when she was 2 weeks we switched to size 1.

Good luck and Congrats on the baby they sure so grow fast!|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Try to remember how long it took your older children to move up a size and base it on that.  I wouldn't get too many in the size nb/1 because they grow so fast.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	until u have the baby i would only get one newborn, and i would be afraid to buy a big case incase baby's size or shape makes him need a one either immediately or very soon after birth...at most i would order one size newborn to start and maybe a box of size one; you can always order more when you see he's going to need them; and u may find that what worked well for your first baby doesn't fit or work so well with your second; i am an avid swaddlers fan, but i have a friend that swears by huggies...i think i would buy the case at a store that will exchange them and then buy a small pack so if u don't need the case u can return it unopened...jmho|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Only get 3 one for nb size and two for size 1 because babies grow soooo fast its crazy. You can buy them in the store|`|10YksH8caa	1|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Only get one case. With my last son I bought 1 case of 274 size 1 diapers he had outgrown them when I had about 10 or so left. I did have to buy about 160 newborn size diapers as well that I used first. My son was 6lbs. 3 oz. when he was born, he is now 3 1/2 months & 16 lbs. But all babies grow differently.|`|r52rfBkeaa	My son weight 7lbs, 2 oz when he was born and used newborn-sized diapers only through the pack that the hospital gave us.  He then wore size 1 for quite some time.  He didn't weigh 15 lbs until he was about 6 months old... so, with the amount of diapers that newborns go through (anywhere from 7-10 day), you could buy 2 cases and get away with it.  You could always buy more when you know how fast you end up going through them... you could also buy one case of the size 2, in case your baby ends up growing quickly.  You'll end up using them at some point in time anyway!
F8iyUqJBaa	You'll be fine.  Everything you take goes to your baby, but in small doses you'll be fine.  I've have to take it too in pregnancy and My son is great.  I've tried to stay away from all forms of medications for all of my babies, but it's not going to damage your little one in small doses.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	you will be ok as long as its not a daily thing you should be just fine|`|gRcVgmxVaa	Occassional use of ibuprophen in the first two trimesters is generally considered safe. It is a class B medication. Double check with your provider to make sure there are no other reasons why you should not take ibuprophen.    As you know, TAKEN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS CAN CAUSE BIRTH DEFFECTS.|`|mIlWfcOVaa	im a guy but i woulkd but only 1 or 2 it mite not work thgh|`|qX8EFFVtaa	You're fine but you should call your OB.  There are safer (and more effective) pain medications he/she can prescribe....temporarily of course.|`|s1P70K5Saa	yes ibuprofin is a blood thinner. the baby's sack is filled with blood. also the baby is digesting the advil along with you and the babies organs are not properly developed yet. please stop takin ibuprofen please. u dont want ur child to have any defects at least go to the doctors soon.|`|54c33c2b2da66481bc77a67c47e5c81daa	I think that u need to stop taking the ibuprofen. there are several complication that occur with this. U need to consult with your MD about soemthing that is suitable for u without harm to the baby.

i1S8iUAsaa	You have exactly the same symptoms as me and my last period was on the 9th also. I never have sore boobs b4 my period  and they have been very,very sore,and thought I had a bug as I kept feeling sick on and off but was not off my food. I would vary from feeling down to happy to bursting into tears, very unlike me.Also the smell of my favourate perfume makes me gag. I have a child but never experienced these before. I am going to wait with crossed fingers untill the 6th?? May I wish you the best of luck also xx|`|p0prrzf2aa	yes you should take a test asap :)|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	uhhhh yes they are all the symptoms! right on the nose!    how about you go to your doc to take a test, that is your best bet to know for sure...|`|MzqZGvalaa	Yup|`|bSZK2tVtaa	Well take a test and use first urine pee. That is the most accurate. But all of those are symptoms hunni.     Good luck darling,    Sara|`|o8xNTVWTaa	yes all of them u need to test good luck|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	B4 I start I am answering this in my husbands name has mine keeps signing out.

Give it till 16th Feb and then go also take a water sample with u as if u r u won't b far on so u need to take ur water sample from the 1st time u use the toilet that morning cause it may not show up l8er in the day.    Gud Luk|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Those are symptoms.|`|e8W9Q9cbaa	Yes, other possible symptoms are heightened sense of smell, darkening of nipples, strong gag reflex, nausea, aversion to certain foods you normally like, metallic taste in the mouth, excessive tiredness.    Sounds like you need to do a test!
JlHobP4taa	No I highly doubt that you are! BUT....if you STILL think you are take a test. It won't hurt anyone other than your bank account.|`|hs6U2lRzaa	i don't think that you are pregnant, but could be just take a test|`|xgke3Lh9aa	could be why don't you take a test?|`|XUD9AfERaa	take a test, that will let you know, instead of using yahoo answers.|`|YzCPY48qaa	chances are slim that your pregnant,but best thing to do is to take a test to put your mind at ease.x.|`|XSP24wJ7aa	Doubt it.<br>  <br>  But yeah erm.. take a test.
3WWHWsHOaa	Absolutely. We need to help ourselves before we help others. Wether the non American is an illegal alien or someone living in a foreign country. We owe it to our citizens to help them first.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	sorta<br>  i do believe that anyone who is sick or injured should receive medical treatment in a hospital.  not sure if that falls under your umbrella or not.  i know its not popular but i'm a humanitarian in that aspect.  if a person gets their leg cut off and needs medical attention or dies - i want medical attention.<br>  <br>  other than that - i don't want children to suffer.<br>  <br>  i did think that you had to have a valid social security number to get any type of assistance.  thats not true?<br>  <br>  <br>  edit - hmmm 3 people want someone to die just cuz they are "illegal"?  thats nice. hope you guys sleep well at night w/that thought.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I think citizens should get the help first. After the people who need it actually start getting it, I think America may become a better place. I'm not against people immigrating, but if they can't afford to come here and support themselves until they get settled, maybe they need to rethink it for a while... It's sad really. But I guess that's the way it is.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I do agree, but I would add one more thing.  If they are going through the process to become a legal citizen, then I think it should be available to them as well.  I have no problem with people immigrating into our country *legally*.  My problem is when they do illegally and then we still end up footing the bill to support them.  <br>  <br>  It's not that I don't feel for their circumstances, because I do!  But there comes a point where you have to make a decision as to what's best for your citizens, and sometimes that a hard decision to make.  <br>  <br>  I look at it this way.  If you saw a homeless person who really needed a meal, but you had only enough for your children, would you take from your children to feed a stranger?  Probably not.  If we had a surplus of money and could afford it, then I would say yes, help them.  But as it stands, we don't.  We're going bankrupt and are taking care of people who are here illegally.  Why should I be paying for their food and health care when I can barely scrape by myself...and without assistance, because we don't qualify.  It's hard deciding whether you should pay for a phone and care insurance or health insurance because your child needs to see a doctor.|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	I do. I know people will call me mean or whatever but I know I wouldn't go to another country and just expect them to support me and my family so why should people be able to come to America and do that?|`|AA10186411	DEFINITELY.  I think to do ANYTHING in this country you should have to be a citizen.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Like my mother used to say, "Charity begins at home!!"|`|c4e661b88a0133da8f1e15500df223dfaa	Disagree:<br>  <br>  I saw many children who did not qualify for medicaid. To qualify for medicaid you need to be a US citizen or be a lawfully admitted immigrant, meaning you would need to go through INS. <br>  <br>  For food stamps, you have to be living in the US for 5 years or meet other criteria in order to qualify. It is not automatic eligibility that some assume.<br>  <br>  The only program that I know of that does not check immigrant status is the WIC program.  <br>  <br>  Most of the aid that I helped hand out was in the form of vouchers to pay for food items. We also gave out referrals to free clinics and other assistance programs (many of those run by charity organizations). <br>  <br>  Children in my opinion should be taken care of regardless of their citizenship status.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Do I think they should have to be American *citizens*? No... People who are here, legally, but aren't yet citizens? I'm fine with them receiving aid, if needed.<br>  <br>  I've never been one to care only about my own country; I care, period... Especially about the poor kids who have no choice. (I'm not referring to 'poor' as in 'lack of money.') I do think there's no reason for anyone in America to NOT have food or shelter... But, there are other people here, and call me strange, but I want a roof over every child's head, and food in every child's belly... That doesn't mean I agree with people coming here, and parking it, illegally.<br>  <br>  *edited* I really wish I knew why some people can't handle other people's opinions... Giving thumbs down, cause we don't agree? Whoever you are, it's time to grow up.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Yes. <br>  And I also believe that in cases where the person is a capable being, that they should get turned off of aid unless they have worked or do work or are trying to work, to put some of that money back in.<br>  I mean how could that ever happen, but I just cant stand the people who have never worked a day in their life and just collect.<br>  I am someone who has been working on the books (before that babysitting) since I was 14, so when I was on mat. leave I had no problem collecting because I knew I had put in all those years prior.|`|PpheQM2naa	Yes it should be a law<br>  <br>  If your not an american citizen then your not paying the social security taxes, and if your not paying the taxes then you dont put any money into the system before you receive the aid, so basically your getting free money just because you came to the country and cant find a person who would hire an illegal citizen.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps =]|`|AA10478146	Totally!!!!!!!|`|2WoUvFUJaa	Heck ya!|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I'm with you stay at home mom.  I too am a humanitarian, and I believe that everyone should be entitled to at least basic health care.  I don't have a problem with helping people who come to our country and I don't agree with the philosophy of only helping "ourselves" first.  It should not be a US legal status issue, it should be a human issue.  When we start to deny people basic rights we start to become morally bankrupt.  You are in a deficit because your government does not make such things a priority and has spent more money on war.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	hey, don't stop asking political-minded questions or it will be too boring around here.<br>  <br>  no i don't.  i happen to be married to a permanent resident with a green card, who has lived in this country since childhood, who works very hard, and who I think ought to be as entitled as anyone to benefits in the event of catastrophic illness or job loss.  My brother-in-law has lived here as a permanent resident with very severe disability for a long time but has only become a citizen in the last couple of years.  i do think he was as entitled to health care assistance the day before his citizenship papers went through as the day after.  i think even illegal residents should be entitled to things like emergency room care.  as far as other benefits, no, i don't think the adults should be entitled to them, but there may be some situations where it makes sense for their children to be.<br>  <br>  do you have any statistics about how much government aid goes to illegal aliens? i'm guessing it's pretty minimal? don't you need to be a citizen or legal resident right now for things like medicaid?|`|VwMkiLFPaa	It should be mandatory!<br>  <br>  Example: A couple sneaks into the country and brings their newborn baby here. That child is technically “illegal” but it’s okay for them to go through the school system. Graduate high school. Get free aid, benefits, health insurance, etc. But once that child turns 18, they’re on their own and able to be deported. They were illegal the entire time, but now they’re 18 so now it matters. <br>  <br>  We had a girl who was barely 18 that came to apply at our company. She had all the proper paperwork. Social security card and everything. We then put her social into the government system that checks to see if your social is valid. Just because you have one, doesn’t mean it’s valid. And what’s even MORE sad is that this girl is the sole supporter for her family because she was (sort of) the only person who is almost capable of working with a social security number. An invalid one, but if a person doesn’t check it, they wouldn’t have a clue. <br>  <br>  I think it should be mandatory. Why should other people be rejected of benefits or anything of the sort when they ARE an American citizen with proper paperwork when you have people in the system, taking those same benefits, that are illegal in every sense of the word???<br>  <br>  It irks me. As you can probably tell.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Not at all.  <br>  <br>  When visitors come to my house and need something or when I see someone in need of help out in the world in my daily life, I don't check first to see if they are a member of my family before I help them.  I just help, if I can.  <br>  <br>  There are immigration & naturalization laws in place that can be enforced to maintain our borders & population.  Those laws & the people we pay to enforce them, can continue to do their jobs.  <br>  <br>  But, in the mean time, if someone needs food, healthcare, housing, education, I take pride in living in a country that takes care of it's less fortunate, both the ones that live here and the ones that are visiting.  <br>  <br>  My favorite hymn when I was a kid was the one that goes, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me."|`|TQW5E6olaa	Or someone who has gone through the process to be here legally. My dad is a permanent resident, I'd hope that after all the tax money he's paid over 30 years, he could receive aid if he needed it.<br>  <br>  But I do understand what you're saying|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes<br>   The money going out to illegals does contribute to the shortage but mismanagement is the biggest reason.
PQQipirDaa	My son has been doing this since he was three, but what really shocked me was when he was getting off the school bus one day (3 nearly 4) and a little girl brings his back pack to him. He says, "oh ha, that's krista she's my girlfriend, mom." smiling from ear to ear. Then when I go in for conference I find out that he also has a girlfriend in class Jenny, his teacher said they hold hands all day etc... He kept those two for a year , they were both his girlfriends (weird thing is he knew somehow they shouldn't know about each other) all the time flirting with other girls, little girls walk up to me and tell me they are his girlfriend, he is in preschool.     Recently, he decided he didn't like Jenny anymore and Krista dumped him, he is crushed apparently "she has a new boyfriend, some yucky boy that does gross things" He would like to know how he can be cool so Krista will love him again. It's actually kind of sad in a cute way.    So my answer shock and awe is what I felt. my first thoughts were what, isn't it a bit early for this.|`|NuUMDTrTaa	He is just copying you and what he sees on TV, so unless it gets out of control, don't worry about it.

What happened to my little baby?   I'm not especially proud but I'm not fearful either. Its not like they do anything ' inapropriate' like touching or tongue *yikes* just some little kisses on the cheeks.

801022f65fca3e71187b34a99f036a2baa	I don't believe there should be a limit to IVF attempts, successful or otherwise.  The number of children a person wants should not be legislated.     The logical limit I have heard proposed in response to the octuplets is that there is a limit to the number of embryos that they should implant in a woman under 35 (with the assumption that the older the woman the less likely she is to conceive with only a couple of embryos).  I have the feeling that whatever doctor implanted this woman is about to lose his professional reputation, if not license.      Now what I have the largest ethical dilemma with personally, is how Social Services should handle her.  While I don't believe in legislating the number of children someone should have, I do believe that someone who chooses to have a large number of children when they cannot support them better be prepared to have limited or no welfare support when they do so.    Being that she has six children with only one income to support them, she's likely on public aid already.  Choosing to have more after that point?  The ethical dilemma is whether the children would be harmed if the family has reduced aid.  Take them away if she can't take care of them?  Sad, but a possible solution if the woman's parents can't help enough.|`|GCcQPzD6aa	No I think it is up to the individual to decide how many attempts to have. Although I do believe that at each attempt less eggs should be transferred to reduce risk of multiple children. Twins are fine but I think that any more than two is unfair on the children as babies need alot of attention and if you have more than twins you just cant give the attention needed. But if the person then decides to go on and have more children later on I think they should be allowed to, After all people who conceive naturally get that choice. Although having said that I feel that people with no children should have a priority over people who already have children.|`|hqogf9oGaa	If you are refering to NHS funded IVF and fertility treatment which places no cost on the parents then it's important to know that once you have given birth to a live child you are no longer entitled to NHS treatment.  Also, the amount of attempts that a couple are allowed on the NHS are restricted.  In some areas couples are allowed one cycle free of charge, others two and in some areas couples are lucky enough to be entitled to 3 cycles if needed.    If you do not have a child and you have used your NHS entitlement then you have to pay and if you do have a baby your entitlement ceases.      Also, if a woman has a child from a previous relationship however cannot conceive with a new partner then they will not be allowed NHS funded treatment however, if a male has a child from a previous relationship but cannot conceive with their new partner they will be allowed NHS treatment (in most areas).    If you are referring to all and any IVF/fertility treatment (and in particular where couples pay for treatment themselves) then I would ask would you try and tell a fertile couple who can conceive naturally how many children they can have?  There should be no distinction between fertile and infertile couples with regard to how many children they should be "allowed" to have.    It is entirely a couples decision how many children they would like to have and that decision is usually based on how they feel they would cope with more children not only emotionally but financially too.  Responsible people take the decision to create another life seriously and do not just have babies for the sake of it.  Some people would like large families whilst others merely want the gift of one child - that is entirely a personal choice and I would hate to live in a society which saw fit to dictate who can and cannot have children, how many they can have whether they need IVF or not.    Indigo|`|Ka52nbhNaa	I believe that so long as you can support the children (mentally, spiritually and financially) and have the means to pay for IVF - whether it be out of pocket or through insurance . . . than go for it.      We do not limit people that conceive naturally . . . we do not say, hold it, you have 6 children . . . we are going to automatically tie your tubes now.  Why should it be any different for those dealing with infertility?    I am personally against transferring more than 2 - 3 embryos though . . . the uterus was not designed for a high-order birth and it puts both the mom and the unborn children at high risk.|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	if yo have childrena and there are the resoursces then fine, however if ther is a couple that hasnt got any children they should be prioratised|`|8jxMCXjuaa	If you are paying for the treatment yourself and it is not government funded then I see no reason why you should be 'stopped' having children.  People who do not require IVF to conceive are not stopped from having children.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I think that this issue shouldn't be limited to a couple only dependent on the amount of children they have.  A couple should be allowed to do IVF as many times as they want as long as there are not medical complications that could arise.  Meaning that their doctor still feels she is able to carry a baby and have a healthy child.  I think if a couple is willing to go through the process of IVF and can financially pay for it and is in good mental and physical health then it is their choice.  However, I feel it is unethical and risky to transfer more than 3 embryos at a time.  When they go putting back 6-8 embryos then there is a real chance that they can all implant.  Dangerous for mother and babies.  So it needs to be done with caution.    If you limit a couple to IVF or any fertility treatments then couples having babies the "natural/normal" way should also have limitations on them as well.  Why would it be ok for a healthy couple to have 8 children naturally but it wouldn't be ok for a couple to go through IVF 8 times to have the same amount of children?    Just my opinion.    Will possibly be doing IVF in a couple of months!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I don't think we are the ones who decide how many children a person has.  How many embryos are transferred are another matter - that becomes an ethical problem for the doctors involved as it puts the mother's life at risk to transfer too many.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	If you want more children I don't think you should be stopped from having IVF, even if you did have multiple children you decide if you want more.
373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I answered your other question..    But - I had an early miscarriage in Sept 08 and conceived 14 days after that miscarriage. I had stopped bleeding 5 days after the miscarriage.    I have now just lost my baby at 19 weeks and have been told I can get pregnant as soon as 2 weeks, so can try again as soon as the bleeding has stopped.    There is no guarantee that you will fall pregnant staight away but you are more fertile so you could be.    If you are test in 2 weeks. If you aren't you could get your period from 2-6 weeks, depending on your hormones.    Good luck xxx|`|eemmWU0Haa	Its different for everybody.  I had a miscarriage in December the 15th and I was suppose to get my normal period the 11th of January but for some reason I got it early..the 6th of January ( My birthday) Happy frigging birthday huh? anyways now My body is all screwed up.so Im suppose to start my next period the 2nd of February..still waiting|`|801022f65fca3e71187b34a99f036a2baa	Your chances are very good!     A few years back I had a miscarriage on Christmas Eve and conceived on Valentine's Day, which was my first regular cycle after due to several weeks of bleeding.  Some women may have a regular cycle right away, for some, it may take a month or two.     My son is now 5 and the pregnancy was perfectly fine, despite me being a paranoid mess during his first trimester - overanalyzing every new symptom (or lack of a symptom) because I was afraid of a miscarriage happening again.  If you find yourself doing this, banning yourself from the internet and pregnancy books for a few days can help a lot.     I seem to remember reading in one of the "What to Expect" books that you may actually be more likely to conceive in the months following a miscarriage (haven't found corroboration anywhere else).  Some doctors may tell you to wait six months, but I had no problems getting pregnant immediately.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	You are most likely not pregnant, but you may not have a period this month either.  That is one reason many doctors recommend waiting a few months before ttc after having a mc.  Besides letting your body heal and hormones to normalize, you also want to be sure you return to a normal cycle.  Don't be surprised if your whole cycle "resets" to   something completely different.
WwCBomTMaa	LOL!! I have answered some pretty stupid pregnancy questions myself. And have seen some pretty stupid answers as well.    The thing I remember most about Sex Ed is how they seemed to teach us how to have sex more than they taught us the meaning of sex. How we reproduce was only touched on vaguely. I remember using a banana and putting the condom on it, also when I was in high school condoms were passed out during Sex Ed and all we talked about was safe sex. I betcha that as the years pass the classes get even more stupid than they were when I was in school.     No wonder our children and teens are missinformed!!    Edit: LOL!! I'm sorry I just have to know......is the reason your asking this question because you were missinformed in sex ed and now your pregnant? I'm sorry, couldn't help myself.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	I have been answering questions for 2 years and I have completely lost track of the number of "am I pregnant" questions I have seen.

MzqZGvalaa	I felt like that, bad news hon, sometimes the sickness doesn't go away until the babies here, sorry.  I spewed my guts out for the whole time, with both of mine.  If you think it's going slowly now, just wait 'till near the end, when time seems to sssttrreeetttccchhhh, and a day takes a whole week to pass!! ha ha|`|eeyGYRcPaa	it always feels like it's going slow! then you look back and go wow has it really been X weeks?!?!!? like i'm 16 weeks and i remember taking the test like it was yesterday!!|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I felt exactly the same way when I was in the first trimester, it just drags!! Don't worry though, cause when you get past that and start to feel the baby and such it FLIES!!! I can't believe that I only have 11 weeks to go! It seems like just yesterday I took the pregnancy test, you know?     Good luck on the pregnancy and congrats!!|`|PYySLOw6aa	I was that way and still that way i cant wait  I want to meet my baby girl but in the end time flys!!|`|15UZwW2laa	Yeah when I was pregnant with my first the time seemed to just drag by!  But now I'm pregnant with my second and I will be 5 months on Tuesday and it's seems as though I just found out I was pregnant.  I can tell you from experience, just enjoy being pregnant cause you will miss it.  Also you should try to rest as much as possible before your little bundle get's here.  Congratulations!|`|GnFCTnRCaa	when you get farther along it will still seem like its taking forever for it to be over. I am 25 weeks, and I found out when I was 4-5 weeks. I still feel like I can't wait for the baby to be here.|`|AA10027086	yes im sure most women feel that way, i know i did. even after my son was born i couldn't wait until he was older so he could play and run and talk...but now i really miss when he was a baby where he would cuddle and he was just so innocent! i think the same goes for pregnancy-enjoy every stage of pregnancy because it is all amazing!!! every step of the way!!
cYRZpGkqaa	Yes. I love my mom a lot, but I don't like her at all half the time.|`|miPubuDYaa	I would say: Absolutely yes!<br>  <br>  I love my brother because he is my brother. But at the sametime i absolutely hate him. He has no ethics, he steals, doesn't work and lives off my parents and unemployment. He doesn't even try to find work. Instead he broke into my home and robbed me, he steals from my parents, my cosuins home and we have even caught him stealing from my 7 years wallet. How can you like someone like that?<br>  <br>  Me on the other hand moved at 21 had a baby at 22, graduated college at 24 and worked for the same compnay moving up for the past 6 years. I'm 29 years old now and i could never imagine spending my life like my brother.|`|jwftwLBTaa	Definitely- I always told my mother that- In fact at your age, I wrote her a letter and told her that. But now that we are a lot older, I see why she was the way she was and now I love and like her. Now my sisters and brothers, that's a different question!|`|eWObKmBSaa	Yes, it sure is.|`|a1XEf8lKaa	Let me answer it this way, Is it possible to like your parents and not love them?  It's family, I love my mom and all my sibilings but most days I do not like them at all...... But they are family and they will alawsy be there when you need someone to have your back, wether you like them or not!|`|9RLXqtOUaa	You bet. Loving someone doesn't necessarily mean to have to like them or their actions. I love my kids dearly but quite often do not like their actions. My mother in law on the other hand, not even sure I love her..... :0 She can be quite mean in her words to my kids.|`|s7TOT09Kaa	Yea it is, its like that in my family.  Because you know shes family, you love her, but because of her behavior, you don't like her.|`|5jn0kwaEaa	Good on you for calling her out on it to her face. Maybe she'll take the hint. That's a sad situation but totally possible.|`|CgitIVCsaa	Oh wow , I know exactly what you're saying ( my mom acts like that too) I can't stand to be around her most of the time , but I still love her.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Based on your mom's personality, I'd say yes it's possible to love your parent but not like them.<br>  <br>  My mother in law's brother walked out on his wife and kids 7 years ago.  She still loves him, but she does not like him at all right now.|`|satoCRC6aa	thanks for describing my mother to a tee<br>  <br>  I have put up parameters to speak to my mother due to the vicious gossip channels she has created<br>  <br>  we only speak of my son, i do not ask for information and do not give any to her<br>  I only tell her of positive things in my life<br>  she dosn't like it but, it stops the gossip
M6c0hUefaa	Well, a couple of days after I had my daughter I had to go to the store. I walked by myself for a while, but then I really needed a wheelchair. It took about a week and a half for me to be able to walk without a wheelchair for long periods of time.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	about 1 hour- then i went to sleep for a a little bit and i was up again.      had him at 5 am and that evening i went up to  the NICU to see my friends baby whom she had the day before   hmm i went to go pick up my pay check at work two days after i had him- 4 days went to sam's club and on day 5 went to pick up more things for baby shower(party favors)|`|52bAHCaUaa	I was up when I was still in the hospital, I remember going down to see my daughter in the NICU and one of the nurses said "didn't you just have a baby today?" That was probably around noon, and I had her at midnight, so I guess I was getting around pretty good! But if I had had the choice to stay in bed, I probably would have! :)|`|gGW7K9U5aa	After my first born, it took me a little while before I wanted to get out to the store by myself. It was more of being to nervous to do it all on my own. About 3 weeks or so after he was born, I got more confidence to go out and do my daily errands that needed to be done while my husband was at work. This time around, it only took my about a week, and thats only because I had a csection and needed time to heal..lol.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	I took my baby to the grocery store when he was 4 days old. The family still had to eat, and his daddy sure wasn't going to cook for us.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	A woman takes 6 weeks to heal up after delivery, and she should not leave the house for two weeks after. In traditional Japan a woman was waited on hand & foot for several weeks after giving birth. American women are crazy to get going again. I have heard men brag about how fast their wives went back to work after the baby came.   This is sheer nonsense. It took nature 9 months to go thru the pregnancy, and a few weeks should be mandatory for recovery. The pelvic bones have to get back in place, and a lot of other stuff. The doctor told us no sex for 6-8 weeks for maximum healing, and my husband waited 3 months. I will always remember how kind he was.  The woman should spend a few weeks getting to know her baby and welcome it to the world. It takes a lot to adjust to feeding and caring for this new member of the family. (Breast feeding is best of course)  I did not leave the bedroom to do any work around the house for at least 10 days. Then only laundry and light cooking. I did not get back into full swing with each of my kids until 1 month.  We even put off the newborn check up at the doctor's until 3 weeks, because my husband did not think that the baby and I should have to travel a long distance -- the doctor's office was over an hour away. Hope this helps.|`|3klIx1Egaa	an hour.. once my epidural cleared|`|V8wUAVdyaa	about two weeks.. my back and legs were pretty sore|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I had a drug-free birth of a 8.7lb baby with an episotomy and I walked to my post-partum room 2hrs after the birth.  I felt great.  High as a kite.  I would have discharged home the next day if the doctors would have let me.  I was doing laundry and back to my old self right away.  My husband and I went to the store with baby at 3days old after a doctor appointment.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	When I brought my daughter home from the hospital. I went to the store like 3 blocks from my house to get some juice.|`|claW4UUcaa	with my first it took awhile i felt like i got hit by a bus! we went to my hubbys job three days after i had the baby. i was waddling lol. after my second baby not even a half hour after i had the baby i was up and dressed in regular clothes. that night i walked down to the cafeteria to get dinner for my husband and i.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	Once all the pain went away. Probably like 2 days after I got home from the hospital.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	the day i left the hospital i felt OK to walk around, go to the store, etc. we actually had to stop by babies'r'us on our way home to pick something up. i probably would have been fine throughout my hospital stay if i hadn't had a catheter. i had one because i had an epidural, but after labor and delivery, i couldn't urinate, so they had to put it back in. walking around w/ a bag of pee aint pretty!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Pretty quickly, i think i took him to the store at 3 or 4 days old, and i felt fine, i had a fairly easy delivery though.  It really depends on what kinda birth u have (vaginal - naturally or with epidural or c-section), plus it depends on if tear durin a vaginal birth).  I had an fairly easy natural vaginally in which i didn't tear at all so that's why i think i felt fine so soon.  Every woman is diff. though, so u'll hafta see how u feel after havin ur daughter.  But don't over do it, only do what u feel comfortable with, if u feel too tired to go to the store then just don't go til u feel more up to it.  Hope this helps, :D.|`|4QTaOm8qaa	i was out 2 days after i came home from the hospital. we went to the mall and the airport. i think it is up to how you feel and how your body feels.
4gZYucHMaa	I think you have every right to be upset--myself I've had a cake order wrong and when you put such effort to make everything else *perfect*, the one thing that isn't in your hands get's messed up, yeah it drives me crazy too!    I'm sure your son will be fine with it and value the time he has with you more.....but also I'd have to say I'd of taken it to the management level!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Getting a different order than what you placed shouldn't mess up his birthday.Its not about the cake...its about the kid's b-day.    That being said, I would have went elsewhere when the individual that you placed the order with seemed unsure.That was a red flag.Defiantly go to a different place next time.    I disagree that they acted rude...that was not right and they shouldn't have hesitated to give you a discount since they did mess the cake up.    They should have better manors when dealing with their customers.|`|YWekskHcaa	i would be horrified. and if it is like a chain store where there is an overall manager, not just the store manager, i would write to them, explaining the story.|`|qLkknQx1aa	everyone makes mistakes, you are really stressing yourself out over this. - cakes can be difficult and cake makers can be idiots.. - heck, have you ever gone through the drive though, ordered fries and gotten onion rings? - Yes, your son only turns 16 once, so the cake got messed up. - so you make it up to him and surprise him with with something else sometime down the road.....|`|AA10624857	I am sure your son was more concerned that he got to spend his birthday with his family than what the birthday cake actually looked like.  Sounded like you wanted to go with the Super Bowl theme on it and you did get the basics.  A cake with helmets of the 2 teams plus the cupcakes in the right colors sounds acceptable even if it wasn't exactly right.  What are football rings and why was it bad for all the cupcakes to have them?  Actually, I think 1/2 white and 1/2 chocolate is a good way to go with the cupcakes since not everyone likes or can have chocolate.  It doesn't sound as if everything was wrong.  You got 1/4 sheet cake plus cupcakes for $15, that's a pretty good deal.  I'd enjoy my son's birthday with the cake we got and just not deal with that particular bakery again.  It helps to look at things in perspective.  The cake will be eaten and no one will remember tomorrow what it even looked like.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I can understand your frustration more than you know. I have an aunt in an institution......    It was a mess up, you did see red flags, you were called and read back the request correctly, they ended up giving you 10.00 off but it's not the cake that is the problem here... it is your frustration with not being able to do exactly what you want to do with your child because he is in an institution. I know you are not thinking of it this way, but i'm shure you feel guilty about it, and the cake was just the thing to set you off because it wasn't as you wanted it to be. Just like things with your son are not as you want them to be.  I'm not trying to be judgmental here, or saying you are a bad mom or nothing like that. Not at all. Have you tried to get some help for feeling the way you do?      EDIT.. i guess when i said i can understand your frustation more than you know i wasn't in full knowledge of what i was talking about... i've got a child that is much like your own, only she is 7 years old. I've emailed you once already, but now i kinda know the situation. I've added you as a contact and would really like to correspond with you about our children if that is okay with you. My child is at home with me right now, but i'm afraid that she is going down the same path as your son.... i know how frustrating all this can be because i'm living it right now!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	You got a good deal on alot of cake. Sucks that they messed up the order- just dont order from them again... but really... you only ended up paying 15$ for something thats worth a lot more? I'd say Deal!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	i would get pissed and then go off. tell the manager what happened and tell them you will never come back and you will tell all your friends that they suck. i mean he only turns 16 once. but then again, it is just a cake. i would of told them to shove it and make it yourself. but yeah you have every right and then some to be pissed. happy birthday to your son!!
BkdZq0QPaa	thats alot of weight to loose in a month<br>  but try excerising more and keep off fatty foods|`|qxteTM9Kaa	No junk food of any kind,walk /jog  for about an hour or more a day.Eat lots of vegetables.|`|0udjgaoBaa	How tall are you if you are under 5ft then yeah hit the gym if you are 5'4 or over you are at a perfect weight you have curves! Do you want to look like jessica biel or classia flockhart? google them if you dont know who they are.|`|8CuQa2OJaa	Cut calories, exersize daily, and walk a lot to maintain a good weight.<br>  Don't eat after like 8 at night because it will just sit in your stomach, and stay off the junk food, like soda and chips and candy. Eat more fruits and veggies. Control cravings, and if you get them, eat a low fat yogurt or granola bar.|`|AA11296427	Get to the gym!<br>  Or even to the park for a run (like 3 times a week).<br>  Keep of the soda and chips<br>  <br>  <br>  :]<br>  <br>  [10-20 is a bit impossible to loose in that amount of time though, it's unhealthy, and you'll end up putting back on the weight as fast as you lost it.]|`|QQE58qFQaa	What I found helped for me was cutting what i ate in half.. and exercising the parts of my body that i wanted to fix.. (my stomach and thighs), I was happy with how the rest of me looked for the most part....<br>  <br>  I went from 125 to 108 in about 4 months<br>  i am 5'3 - 5'4|`|MFwWifGIaa	Ha im like 147.4 and I'm dying to loose weight. If you live in a region with snow you always pack on a couple pounds. In warmer seasons I'm like 135-138 you can definately loose it. Try going to a gym but if you're not very athletic try weight watchers its cheaper than jenny craig and you dont have to eat microwave meals.. I know its embarassing for a teen to diet in public. You could also try the Special K challenge. You can go online and make a plan and walmart sells all of their stuff for cheap. I think if you replace 2 meals a day with their cereal (add a little fruit its bran flakes so its boring) for 6 weeks you loose 12 pounds. And you can eat cereal for breakfast and dinner so no one at school will know and the challenge allows 1 meal of choice so lunch at school?<br>  <br>  If you have the money I'd DEFINATELY try pilates.<br>  I get in my best shape with that plus 20 minutes of cardio on your off-days. You always allow one day inbetween for rest in pilates. I got to 119. Best shape of my life.|`|a5tItBhYaa	you could try cutting what you normally eat in half and working out(more)
d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	I agree.. No child should be around even second hand smoke, let alone drugs and alcohol.     I also agree with the "teen" portion. Teen moms are already looked down on so it is easy to push them further down, even tho that is not always the case. I work with a young lady who was a teen mom. Getting pregnant was the BEST thing that could have happened to her. She is a great mom and a better person than she would have been, taking for granted that she would have lived to see 20.     I quit being friends with a guy I had known for 20 years because he let his child (3 years old) take a drink from his glass... a glass that had a very strong (his words) long island ice tea (alcoholic drink for those that dont know). I reported him to Child protective Services and havent spoken to him since. He didnt have his first child till he was 28, and this child was his 4th.|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	wow very interesting Question!! Yea i think theres so much pressure put on teens for being teen parents yet when actual adult parents make decisions they arent always perfect either- you have a good point, responsibility comes from who you are  and how responsible not how old you are.|`|ooaT4uGraa	It's just irresponsible parenting. Why would you want to put your child in that danger, regardless of how you feel about drugs, etc.   So yes, I agree, it's wrong, and a teen would be ridiculed. (But I also think that if an adult asked if it was okay, they would get ridiculed to.)|`|3IXj7jQNaa	i think its terrible.we went to a halloween party (only drinking) and someone had brought their 4 year old. parties are no place for kids in less its at chuck e cheese!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	You're right. Bringing your baby into a high-risk situation is just plain bad parenting. It's not acceptable for an adult or a teen. What if there was a fire and mom was too drunk to get baby out?|`|kpiNnkoMaa	I think that if that where to happen than the mother is putting that baby in danger and should have child services on her. That baby could get seriously hurt or worse. so another words i agree.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Too bad you're twisting what the real question was in that post.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	agree no baby should go to a pary like this and a teen would most deff get riduclued|`|fDXrRtkHaa	i personally wouldn't bring my babies anywhere that could harm them.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Your an awful mother if you get drunk, when your child is there. I doubt that mother would, as I read and answered that question..  Same with the get high thing.      Stop looking for fights of teen/adults.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Just because she is going to a party where people are drinking doesnt mean she will drink herself. Or get high. Adults are better in handling 'peer pressure' than teens and dont just blindly follow what others are doing. And if it gets so bad that people are just falling over each other drunk as hell I'm sure she would leave. I read the question you are talking about and she gave no indication on drinking/doing drugs herself. so disagree    edit so you are 16 and you have 2 kids.. so I can clearly see that your judgement level is really high up there... with or without drugs or alcohol..|`|01Mu3wUeaa	What if you get drunk and stumble, fall with the baby?Or get so high you ignore the baby?  I doubt anybody would be getting high or drunk if they bring their child.        What about other drunks/stoners? How do you know your baby is safe when people might fight, fall, stumble, etc!    What if a car crashes into yours? or you get mugged with your child in your arm? 100% safety doesn't exist.        I bring my son to parties.Allot of my friends have kids so all of the kids play in the sun room while the adults chat/drink and some do smoke.    I am never under the influence when my children are around so I don't really trip off it.There have never been any fights at the parties I attend because we are all close and good friends.|`|55c5cbba7c897028d91eb867f8094b8eaa	i totally agree no child of any age should be taken any were there is drugs.....!!!!!!!|`|CKr7pB4Saa	bring the baby to the party, that way they will learn to have a good time|`|LKMWuopNaa	dont go cuz wat if u end up having anuther baby all of a sudden???|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Agree. If a teen asked that, she/he be deemed unfit and a "perfect example" of how wrong teen parenting is.    I'm 18 and I don't party, smoke, drink, do anything illegal. Not all teen parents party. Not all teens drink/smoke. I hate when people stereotype! It's like saying " all pit bulls are dangerous!". The people who stereotype, they are ignorant to think that ALL or even the majority people do it. The media don't help either.     That scenario will never happen with me. I'm expecting my first and never would I endanger my baby in any way! I can't prevent a car wreck but I can drive safely. I can't control people's actions but I can control mine. I didn't do anything dangerous before pregnancy( lol I was the "chicken" my sister says) and certainly will not during/after my pregnancy!    I have a cousin thats in her late 20s with 4 children. Her husband does illegal stuff and she used to. They have "wild parties" at their house with drinking, smoking( legal/illegal stuff) among other things. They get so wraped up in their stuff that they don't pay attenion to the 4 children. One child(3) drank beer and they laughed and thought it was funny! That's irresponsible to me. I don't go over there no more( I moved cities) but even when I lived in the same town, I didn't visit her house because I never knew what stuff they were going to be doing that day and there is no way I want to get mixed up in that( I was a minor, good student,etc) so I rarely seen that cousin and her children. I felt sorry for the children. Social services were called plenty of times but the children stayed home...being physically abused and with the illegal presence...gah.     Now I'm about 4 hours away( by car lol) and I feel sorry for the children( they used to spend the night with me to get out of the house). If I could afford all 4 children, I certainly would take them but I can't and plus I'm expecting my first baby.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	AGREE!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	i disagree. i have been drunker then hell and still took care of my kids. and you cant get "so high" that you ignore the baby. i get high everyday and still take care of my kids. no they are not bad parents, but really leave the kid with a sitter. whether you are an adult or a teen parent. LEAVE THE KID WITH A SITTER. it just depends on the people you are with. like i dont drink until my kids are sleeping.
mFZGIPcWaa	Wow, I'm due for period too same time, my last one was Jan 10th and ovulation was the 24 for me and husband. We are trying for baby  4 and I know what you are going thru. I feel irritable as well and dizzy alot!!!! I know it's too soon to test since HCG levels go up by each day. best time to take a test would be next Friday. 5 days before next period. Also, if you feel warm/feverish that could be another sign. Best of Luck.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	test your pee|`|nrFbE1jYaa	i think you are pregnant. check out ivillage online and calculate your ovulation time.  congrats!!!
DVmDWDC4aa	You'd "probably" be providing a life for a child that otherwise would remain in care till adulthood. Kids in countries such as Russia and the Ukraine, do not have the same chance when put up for adoption as ones here. HEre there are lengthy waiting lists for babies, but over there, there aren't.<br>  <br>  So... not only are you helping out a child which otherwise wouldn't be given a great start in life, AND who probably hasn't had a good time so far (have you seen their orphanages?!) but you also cut out a lot of waiting time on UK waiting lists if you're after a particular age group.<br>  <br>  If possible to adopt from over there, I would, purely because of what that child won't have had so far in their short little life.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Well, as for the "why".. I'm open to pretty much any ethically-done type of adoption, when the time comes. I first want to try US fostercare, but I can't say which doors will open and which will not, when the time comes.<br>  <br>  The reason I WOULD adopt from another country is simply because I want to be a parent to a child who needs one. From what I understand it DOES seem like there are many children in certain countries (especially girls in China and India) that are left in orphanages and in need of a home.. It seems like there is "a need."  So I would consider that. <br>  <br>  I think that IF everything possible is done to ensure the adoption is ethically done and the child's best interests are held first and foremost, I don't think it's anyone's place to judge which type of adoption you or I decide to pursue..|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Sadly sometimes it's ownership and the fact that they adoptee will never re-connect with their family.<br>  <br>  In the UK it is mandatory that the child knows his or her heritage and has some form of contact with their family (which has been found to be in the best interests of the child).  This makes some adopters uncomfortable and so they try to evade the situation.<br>  <br>  Some adopters have been turned down for adoption in the UK because they are considered unsuitable.  These people refuse to take no for an answer and so pursue other avenues to get what they want.|`|6W7nJYskaa	I don't know why people try to adopt from abroad. I have always been of the opinion that you shouldn't look elsewhere while there are children in need of love and homes here. :-)|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I am in the UK and we (dh & I) chose domestic older child adoption over IA adoption because there are so many children in the UK in foster care.  I don't have a problem with IA in general but from a personal point that's at least less child who is adopted domestically and I couldn't have that on my conscious.   At any given time there is on average 50,000 children in care which is disheartening.|`|5c187f748a208cc6e83296a593f81025aa	It is a false belief that there are not children in the U.S. who need homes.  My son is adopted and if you are not in the market for the perfectly healthy - lily white child than you would be meeting a great need right here at home.  <br>  <br>  As a PP said, I don't know why there is such a disdain for domestic adoption when there is a real need here.  There are hundreds of thousands in foster care and children/infants who are considered "difficult to place" because of race (sad but true), minor disabilities, more serious disabilities, history of mental illness in the family, and a variety of other reasons.  <br>  <br>  I think you are in the U.K. but I would imagine the same situations exist there.  Do your research before you decide on international vs. domestic.  There are certainly children in need in BOTH situations.  Go where your heart leads you.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	Straight Talker makes a fairly good point, but in reality this decision is based on the same superficial wants that most other decisions a human makes are: the need to feel or have something 'special'.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself exactly and honestly why you are considering this. A child is not a sportscar or a leather handbag. Looking for the most hip, "exotic" model is inexcusable.<br>  <br>  Your comment on the population is commendable. Good luck. I believe you're doing the right thing, just don't do it for the wrong reason(s).|`|OQnRP6xVaa	There are actually NOT very few babies adopted from the US Foster Care system... That is an incorrect statement. The truth of that issue is that when families adopt from Foster Care they are told they should not choose this root if they only want to adopt a baby.<br>  <br>  Reasons: <br>  <br>  1-- Social Services is not in business to find baby's for families they are in the business of finding families for children.<br>  <br>  2-- Even when a newborn is placed as a foster child placement it will take at least and average of 2-years for the biological parents to have their parental right terminated--therefore it is not possible to finalize an adoption of a baby under about the age of 2 (there are situations where this does not always apply usually with the younger siblings of two parents whom have lost rights to other children.)<br>  <br>  3-- The state will Not work with people only interested in adopting infants and will advise those families to consider a different adoption path if they are only interested in a child under 2 years old. <br>  <br>  4-- The state provides in depth training for Foster Families and the current trend appears to be that Foster Families are trained and only want infants in order to achieve an adoption--this means that many Foster Parents are NOT working toward reunification--and in many cases are considered to be working as a "conflict of interest". Several states had laws that disallowed the adoption of a foster child by the foster family prior to 1996 when federal laws mandated that the foster family should be considered the first choice--if there were no relatives able and willing.<br>  <br>  ...just a few issues off the top of my head. I can tell you that when our adopted siblings were matched with us we were astounded to be placed with a 5 and 1 year old... Not long after we were contacted as Relatives of the next baby born... It was difficult emotionally to make the decision we did, However, we felt that the needs of the two children we had were extreme and that we were too old to have a newborn placed. We asked the state to place the new baby with a family that was interested in only the straight adoption program and a family that would maintain contact with us. <br>  <br>  Our request was honored and the state placed the next sibling with a family that was waiting to adopt and not interested in the Foster to Adopt program--that family was stunned to be placed with not one but, two newborn siblings of our children and We do Maintain contact with each other.|`|L092fDbuaa	I don't know about everybody else but I can tell you why I want to do it! I have a biological child and an adopted chil from foster care. My husband and I want one more child (maybe 2) we are leaning towards adoption again! I am Brazilian. I was raised in Brazil until I was 16 yo! And I know for a fact that there are thousands of homeless and orphaned children there! I have seen it first hand. When I was 14 (to right before I came to the US) I visited a place called CAASA which is a shelter for HIV and AIDS patients of all ages. I used to hold these 18 month olds who looked like they were 6 months! I have been thinking about them a lot lately. And about the children selling candy at the street lights. When I say children I don't mean 6 yo old and up. I mean 3 yo subject to getting hit by a car, with no one to protect them. Fending for themselves. For a while there people were afraid of even rolling their windons down because some of these children were aproaching them with a piece of glass, cutting themselves to bleed, and telling them they had aids and if they didn't give them their wallets they would cut them too and infect them! Can you imagine what drives a small child to such a desperate act? They are usually controlled by "pimps" who get a great percentage of their "profits" and in return they get a place to sleep. Sounds like a horror movie right? It is reality. Right down south from the US! That is why I want to adopt from Brazil. Sometimes it gets me really tired to hear all these people claiming to know so much about international adoption when they never left the US! The best way to adopt from another country is to do so through the country's government and/or a local shelter not a private agency. That is what gives room for corruption! Well you wanted a reaso and this is mine! Now you watch all the thumbs down! It is not even funny!|`|vue9NOhYaa	I don't know about the U.K., but there are VERY few babies and children available for adoption in the U.S.  So most people who want to adopt have no choice but to look overseas.|`|zLoyo24Taa	My husband and I wanted to provide a home for children that needed a home and a family. When I started to research adoption, we thought about going international. When I started to read about and see pictures of how the children in a third world country live when they are abandoned by their bio parents, my heart broke. We decided to adopt older children, partly because of our ages, I am 40 and my husband is 41, and partly because the children are released from the orphanage at the age of 13. So we decided to adopt two preteen boys so they do not have to go back to the streets. Make sure that you are adopting "true orphans", this way a family will not have been broke apart to provide you with a child.
WbJPQM1naa	No one can answer your last question ... babies arrive when they are good and ready to arrive.  My first came 10 days after her due date.  I understand how you feel, SO ready to have the baby.  Read, rest, pray, take up knitting booties if you're bored.  Your baby will be here when it gets here!  So relax and practice your breathing exercises!      I'll be praying for you and your great birth experience and healthy baby.  Remember, YOU CAN  and YOU ARE ABLE to give birth to your baby!  Millions of women have done it and you can too!    Much love and take good care,  (oh and drink your water!)    R    If you need something to pass the time:  watch this fantastic video called "Pregnant in America".  It will really open your eyes!    http://www.megavideo.com/?v=QTRRAG2A|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Girl I was just like you. Miserable as hell and it wasn't until I took a chill pill and decided to let nature do its' job that he came. If you are 2cms dialated that plug is gone. Just get some rest now because once the baby gets here you won't be able to and you can go at any minute. Good luck!|`|AA10624857	A due date is just an estimate when a baby might be born.  Average human gestation is considered 40 weeks from the last menstrual period.  But, there are so many variables to consider that delivering anytime 38-42 weeks is considered full-term.  I am mom to 4 who were all born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days, and 7 days.  With my second baby I was effaced and dilated for 3 weeks before his due date yet he still came 11 days past.  I began to efface and dilate with my third baby 6 weeks before her due date and she came 5 days past.  I only noticed my mucous plug with my first 2 babies, but not with my last 2.  Every woman and every pregnancy is different.  Sometimes the mucous plug comes out in a big noticeable glob.  Other times it comes out in small pieces.  For others it doesn't come out until you are in active labor.  It is definitely hard to wait for nature to take it's course, especially when you watch your due date go right on by.  With my first 2, I tried numerous things to get things going.  I walked for miles, had a lot of sex, ate spicy food, tried nipple stimulation, did squats, walked up and down stairs, drove down bumpy back roads, and scrubbed floors on my hands and knees.  I was motivated to get those babies out.  Unfortunately, until both my baby and my body was ready, nothing I did made any difference.  It's impossible to say when active labor will begin.  The good news is that since you are dilating and effacing that you are in the early stage of labor, which is the time it takes to dilate to around 4 cm.  For some women this process can take hours, but for others it can take days or weeks to go through.|`|mFZGIPcWaa	You may want to question your midwife or dr. about a dry birth. The baby is surrounded by amniotic fluid and usually at that 40wk mark the amniotic fluid leaks out. I would be concerned with that and it is possible to miss losing your mucas plug. Some don't realize. But don't worry your baby will be here within a few days at least.|`|3klIx1Egaa	yes you can loose it and not know. I finally had my son at 41 wks 3 days.  Try sex, cleaning (on hands and knees, scrubbin the kitchen floor works lol) and walking.|`|NI8D46J0aa	I was 3 days late with my second. (1st actual labor. My 1st was a c section) and 1 week early with my 3rd. 3 days early with my 4th.   You would know if you lost your mucous plug. It's all stringy and gross when you wipe. Try walking a lot and s ex. It's supposed to ripen the cervix. This is the worst part. I am sorry you have gone over. That's awful. Good luck and I hope you go into labor soon.|`|SRzswqTeaa	I'm sorry you are so miserable.  Losing your mucous plug gives no indication of impending labor, so it doesn't matter if you have noticed it coming out or not.  It may not come out until the middle of labor :-)  You might have had chunks of it come out over the past few weeks (it rebuilds itself within about 24 hours if you do not go into labor).   The good news is that the baby is low, you are 2 and 50%, and your uterus is gearing up for the real deal.  Nobody can say when you will go into labor, not even your midwife - but  I'd be surprised if you went another 2 weeks :-)  If you have any floors that need mopping, get on your hands and knees and do some cleaning.  Sometimes it can help get baby in a better position to help make those contractions become more effective.  IF not, you'll still have a clean (or cleaner) floor!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Try sex!|`|NYe3TfLsaa	Try vacuuming and having sex (not at the same time)!  Worked for me!  Or go for long walks!!!|`|G0QugnQ8aa	try sex semen has a chemical/hormone in it that helps ripen/break down the cervix...or nipple stimulation could help because it releases chemicals/hormones that could encourage contractions|`|opUngk8waa	if the baby is not born soon, he will have to be born by c-section because he will be too large for vaginal birth.  Ways to get the baby moving are 1) have sex, but not too vigorously 2) go on a trampoline !(sounds crazy but usually works)   3)  don't hold back on normal activities!  Things such as cleaning and simply walking around for a long period of time could hint to the baby to get out of there! good luck|`|af113de04b81b474729aa2c6d7e7fcf3aa	Not all women lose or notice that they lose their mucus plug. I've had 3 kids and didn't lose mine with any. The best two things that I have noticed to move things along are extreme house cleaning, like scrubbing bathtubs, or nipple stimulation. Be Very Careful with nipple stimulation, though. It can bring on contractions that are very fast and very hard. I would not recommend this without doctor supervision or if you are more than a little ways from wherever you intend to deliver. congrats on your little one and good luck with the whole nine yards!|`|o9u4H6m6aa	Yeah, it's really frustrating waiting and waiting and never knowing when your baby is gonna come. That's just one of the perks of the end bit of pregnancy.    But feeling anxious about it isn't going to help your baby come any sooner. In fact, relaxing will probably help a bit more. :> I know that's easier said than done.    I find a lot of unnecessary anxiety stems from being fixated on the DUE DATE.  Babies aren't library books. They can't be overdue. They'll come when they are ready.  The estimated due date just means it is normal for babies to be born 3 weeks prior to and two weeks after the date.  If you are mentally prepared that you might still be pregnant at 41 or 42 weeks, then you'll feel more patient at 40 weeks.  :>|`|0437a9a5ca16bc09f111190dcbc55384aa	i know it sounds ridiculous, but nipple stimulation can trigger your uterus to contract... Think about it, when you breast feed, what happens? Your uterus contracts! So you may get labor going that way... And you may not loose a mucus plug until you are in labor, so don't let that be a deciding factor, because I lost mine two weeks before I had my daughter..... and that just means that my cervix was ripening for two weeks.... good luck sweetie... Whether or not it happens tonight or next week, you only have days left!!! I have 7 more weeks to go with  2!!! I envy you!|`|kMOHsGQcaa	sex and along warm bath helped me.. and you could also try castor oil sounds gross but works you have 20mls then again 2 hours later thats it.. try mixing with orange juice tastes better
3tDqt9sXaa	it may be as old as four before a boy will say this. it takes a while longer for boys then girls. you need to encourage him and give him praise when he does go to the bathroom. and give him a sticker or something when he tells you when he has to go because that tells him he is doing something right|`|wcYRxDw2aa	Well my son was 30 months when he started and we bought a bag of sugar free suckers and candy to give when he went.  We would also go to the dollar store when he pooped in the potty and let him pick out a couple of prizes.  Just continue to ask frequently and take him about 10 to 15 minutes after a cup of whatever drink he drinks, and make sure that you give plenty of praise and encouragement.  Good luck and stick it out it pays off in the end.|`|xukz46NFaa	My son will be 3 in 2 weeks.... So he is literally like almost 36 months....  He started to train about 3 months ago on his own. I bought the potty seat thing for home but just left it in the bathroom and paid no mind to it. One day he just went to it and after seeing me go do my thing, he asked me if he could try too... I sat him on his seat and now he knows when he has to go- just cant always make it on time... I am very patient with him-- You need to be, every child grows differently.  If my son gets it this week, next month or another year it would be fine with me, he has this little bladder and needs the nurturing to build his confidence so he can work at it, not yelling and screaming that will ultimately kill any chance of a quick turnover... :)    Hope this helped...|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	This is pretty good!!!! Especially because you guys just started training him last week. Boys usually take longer to be potty trained then girls, so I definetly think your son is advanced and is headed in the right directions. My nephew will be four years old on Feb 20th, and he just got the hang of going to the restroom. So I definetly think your son is on the right track. Just make sure you keep asking him if he needs to go pee pee and show him he correlation between having to pee and going to the restroom, he will definetely get it.    Good luck hun!!!!|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Keep asking him if he has to go pee-pee. That way he can put 2 and 2 together.|`|nrGsxWw3aa	Congrats!! My son was 2 on 9/29 and still no potty.  He will sit on it but that is it.  My daugher was potty trained by 2.  We did not use Pull Ups.

We paid a lot more for our hello kitty bedding.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Yah, I think that was a very good deal!  Most crib bedding (4 piece/s) are usually $60-200 brand new depending on where you purchase them from.      Just keep in mind that Baby's R Us has a TON of crib bedding clearanced all the time!  My boyfriend and I are doing a Baby Noah's Ark theme and we got a 10 piece crib bedding set at BRU for $80.  We're on a budget too, but we couldn't pass it up!  So, just keep in mind!

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My advice is to do what works now and then worry about making a change when it stops working for you and/or your daughter.  If that means co-sleeping, do it.    With my oldest two, I started them in their own beds at the beginning of the night, but co-slept for the rest of the night after the first waking.  My oldest gradually slept longer and longer stretches until she was sleeping all night in her crib by right around a year.  My youngest was a completely different kid, completely different story, and I didn't even night-wean her until age 2.  She's now 4, though, and shares a bed with her sister.  Occasionally, my husband lies in bed with the girls to help them fall asleep, but they sleep most nights on their own with no problems.    I co-slept almost full-time with my son from birth until he was 6 months old.  I hardly ever even put him down for naps until then (he slept in my arms or the sling).  He's now 17 months old and starts every night in his crib and comes to my bed when he wakes the first time.  He's not a great sleeper yet, but last night, he slept for almost 9 hours in his own bed in his own room.  I haven't done anything special either to sleep train him -- he's just gradually getting used to his bed on his own terms.    Your daughter is still so little, and being close to you helps her to relax and sleep more soundly.  Seriously, do what works now, and you can figure out a different plan when the time is right.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I dont think co-sleeping is bad at all. But I do think a baby needs to learn their own bed early. If she's waking up often there must be a reason.... is she teething? get some orajel to sooth the gums... does she need a bottle? or hungry? Feed her about 1 hour before bedtime... and the bottle thing- I have given my baby a sippy cup of water to help her soothe herself at night... its always in her crib. Also make sure you have a consistant bedtime routine- routines help a lot! anyway... I hope you figure out the issue and take care... if you find it best to have her in your bed for now- just know that it will probably be harder to get her out of it later on...|`|6Knhikr1aa	They don't stay in your bed forever. When they get older, they move pretty readily into their own beds. I would try again. It sounds like it will mean better sleep for everyone! Right now is right now. Not five years from now. Co sleeping is healthy and it sounds like the best situation for you.|`|k0TDCEFEaa	Try adding ceral in your baby bottle @ night she'll be a little more fuller an sleep @ least half way through the night|`|bnblT0l0aa	It really depends, do you want to mope around all day looking like you came out of a horror movie OR  do you want to have an almost good night's sleep?    Its your decision but maybe you could put her in an infant positioner on your bed to stop all the squirming.  Ps. I love Victoria Mae, very classy, I'm naming my unborn daughter Alecia Simone.|`|rRfnHJM5aa	the best thing you should do is , lay the baby on the side it is most comfortable on.|`|qCffsVhSaa	Don't do it!  I have a 2 and half year old girl.  I never let her sleep in bed with my husband and I.  As nice and sweet as it may be you should never do it.  My daughter slept through the night at 3 months and right at 6 months suddenly started waking up.  I tried a solution my daughters pediatrician recommended and it worked like a charm.  You may need at least a week of sleepless nights but it the long run you'll appreciate it once you get your sleep back.      First off you need to put her in a different room from you.  You can not sleep in the same room.  Continue your daily night routine; bath, story and then put her tucked in the crib and close the door.  She will cry right away but it's what you have to do.  After 5 mins of crying open the door but not going in the room or saying a word and stand there for 1 min.  (this shows that you there and aware of her crying but she has to go to bed)  If she continues to cry for another 5 mins continue and open the door and stand for another min.  Continue this pattern adding 5 min intervals until she falls asleep.    The first night will be the hardest, my daughter cried for almost 2 hours, the next day 1 hour, the next 15 mins, and finally did not cry...my husband and I argued the first day whether to pick her up or not...but in the end we never stepped into the room and we're both very happy sleepers.    I realize it really hard to resist comforting your baby...but trust me it's the best way.  My daughter freely goes to bed on her own now on a double size mattress.|`|d2OWEnyCaa	Sushishigal-  What you did to your daughter is cruel and viscious! No baby should be left to cry for 2 hours. All they know at that age is that they have been abandoned and no one is meeting their needs. And 6 months is the epitome of seperation anxiety. I can only imaging the emotional trauma you caused your poor helpless child! Your pediatrician is a moron. You took horendously bad advice. That was your mistake, don't try to push that bad advice on other people now.|`|avx7bLnKaa	do you nurse or formula feed?    she may be waking from hunger because this is the age where they are moving more... you could try feeding and see if that puts her back to sleep longer....    or she may be teething... I found baby motrin worked to keep my son alseep during the night while teething
3KD1wCs5aa	I hate to break it to you, but birth control doesn't kill sperm.    EDIT  "Actually birth control does kill sperm, because sperm does not go to a retirement home after you throw the condom in the garbage. It dies without moisture."    Actually, that is the man who decided to release said sperm, not the birth control.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Birth Control Pills don't kill anything.  They actually trick the body into thinking it's pregnant and thus prevent it from releasing an egg.  Nothing dies.  Nothing is killed.  It's exactly the same as having sex with a woman when she is not ovulating, which is neither a sin nor murder.      Fun fact: sperm are not conscious: they are simply a set or organelles (Mitochondria, Flagellum, Acromasome) and one half of a parents DNA (which is simply a chain of sugar molecules, a base, and some phosphates.  DNA is nothing magical, it's more like a road map.)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sperm can die in a man's body- what you're saying doesn't make sense. only a sperm that meets the egg has the potential to grow into a human- not the sperm it self and lots are waisted by self masturbation anyway.  a man has millions of sperm in one ejaculation, certainly no one can impregnate with that many babies.  what you are saying is no one should have sex unless they plan on making babies  hormonal birth control stops ovulation- it doesn't release an egg     you're also saying that all those sperm that didn't get the egg i purposely killed- give me a break, you're a quack     i did not kill sperm, it ddied because it couldn't live outside my man's body unless there was an egg- i didn't abort my son or any other baby- one sperm is just that a sperm- not a human being. what iff there was a woman who could not conceive? should she not have sex becausee she might kill sperm? you're an idot|`|oIFMohfUaa	AWESOME THOUGHTS!      I'd NEVER be able to do it!    However, be strong and be prepared...you'll probably get a lot of flack for this question!!!

You would usually get one within the first month or so. so it wouldn't be a living organisme yet.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Birth control only makes the girl's eggs not mature as they normally would every month.|`|MzqZGvalaa	Shut up you idiot.

Even if pregnancy does occour, only ONE sperm gets to make it to the egg... the rest eventually die off..  same as if you masturbate.. those little sperm that you deposit in your sock will just die off.      Even if you want to look at it that way.. sperm is only a single cell..  do you feel guilty when you wash your hands with antibiotic soap?  Howabout when you spray your toilet with lysol?  Its killing living things, so shouldnt you feel guilty?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	birth control dosent kill sperm, they prevent you from ovulating - but only if you take them every day at the same time each day.  so if you dont ovulate you cant release an egg and if you cant release an egg then you cant get pregnant, go back to sex ed hunny and killing sperm is compleetly different then killing a baby, get educated before you go shooting off your mouth    oh and for the person who says in the first few months its not alive its alive after 22 days when it has a heart beat      GO BACK TO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	wow good question . i would think using bc would be different bc its not killing the combination of the egg and the sperm... sperm alone cannot make a baby it needs the egg. i think it is deff different the abortion .... abortion terminates a living thing while bc dosnt release an egg never alowing it to fedilize if any of that made sence tricky question|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	yeah well it's not the same thing, but maybe the best thing is not to have sex.....|`|5RoYyprkaa	As a person who is in between pro life and pro choice, and as a person who took birth control, there's a difference. Birth control doesn't stop pregnancy, it tricks the body into thinking it's already pregnant, the woman doesn't ovulate, therefor pregnancy can't occur. Birth control stops pregnancy from happening, abortion stops pregnancy from continuing. There is a difference. However, I no longer take the pill  for my own reasons.    I think that if you don't want to get pregnant, then don't have sex. There's nothing wrong with birth control though, abortions should be a choice thought about carefully.     Either way, if birth control is murder then I guess every guy is guilty because everytime a guy masturbates, he kills all those potential babies.    So heartless really.|`|JA60LLGhaa	neither. abstinence.|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	You are really missing the point with birth control. It is your body and your choice. Would you rather have no choices?|`|AA12345296	if that's how you feel then you should know that you kill sperm everytime you have a wet dream. and girls kill eggs every time they have their period.|`|0SLCXs2daa	Um, yeah...go to a health class and see how babies are actually made, and then repost another question-another intelligent question...|`|PW3hcVZiaa	So, people should only have sex to purposely procreate?  If all people did that, the world would be grossly overpopulated.  And I guess guys should never masturbate, either?|`|JB8samC7aa	Birth control prevents implantation of the egg in the uterine wall or prevents ovulation entirely, and thus fertilization cannot occur, and thus no life is ended by birth control.    The whole idea that each sperm is a little person ("every sperm is sacred") is ridiculously outdated.|`|70kh6VSoaa	that is the most retarded thing i have ever heard......birth control doesn't kill sperm and not to mention that just sperm is not a baby not even close birthcontrol keeps the girl from ovulating.....|`|GDobAMQ8aa	1.  Not one form of the birth control pill kills sperm.  2.  People get pregnant despite the use of condoms and other forms of birth control.  3.  A sperm, like an unfertilized egg, is not a life form.    Edit:  Then why aren't you calling women who menstruate "killers", as well?  Menstruation is getting rid of an egg that wasn't fertilized.|`|iZDsMCghaa	WTF?   Lets start with the basics, darlin'.  There is an egg. There is sperm. When an egg makes friends with sperm, it fertilizes, then attaches itself to the uterine wall and wa-la, theres a baby! But before this magical moment, egg and sperm are separate, there is no baby. With this kind of argument, you could also say we are having abortions every time we have our periods or a guy is every time he masterbates, lmao!  Birth control PREVENTS pregnancy, which is preventing the creation of a baby. Abortion is ending a life of a baby already created. There is Absolutely NO comparison between prevention and murder!|`|L94XXSO5aa	I'm not going to give an opinion on this, but I would like to point out to some answerers on here that, yes, some birth control DOES kill sperm.  Spermicide?  There are spermicidal foams that you use with the sponge, with condoms and sometimes even alone.  So no, birth control PILLS don't kill sperm, but it's false to arbitrarily say that birth control in and of itself doesn't kill sperm.|`|5CbddiWJaa	They are both murdering. Why do those people have sex if they know they probably are going to get pregnant? I say it should be illegal to do either.|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Birth control is quite different from having an abortion. Birth control prevents through some means or another the egg from coming into contact with the sperm, hence no ferilisation occurs, there is no zygote, no baby etc etc. If you don't make the egg and sperm come into contact, there can be no baby.  An abortion is the removal of a fertilised egg-without your interference this can eventually become another human being.   An egg or sperm is just half a set of chromosomes, that's it. Alone it can not become a human being, a fertilised egg can.   Are either of them murder? I don't think so. If you think about what murder is, it's the killing of a human. But then if you think about what a human is, well neither an egg, a sperm or even a fertilised egg possess the qualities that I would say identify a human. I mean the way I see it, if you were going to consider using birth control a type of murder, well then abstinence could also be seen in the same way, because once again, you're denying your eggs or sperm access to each other and hence preventing them from becoming a human.   Though for me it depends on at what stage the abortion is done, later stage ones are a bit more confusing...  I do use birth control, but I would really have a lot of trouble with having an abortion, I'm not sure if I could, but I don't judge others.    PS Unless you're not having a period every month, you're already killing eggs every month. And did you know that every 2 weeks all the sperm in a man's body are replaced? Either by masturbation, a wet dream or reabsorbed into the body. They just don't have a very long life span.|`|gga2mwFIaa	Birth control keeps the sperm from implanting in the egg therefore there is no life to kill. Abortion is actually killing a living growing fetus. There is a big difference. Plus a lot of girls don't know they are pregnant until its too late you don't know the day it happens and birthcontrol doesn't always work either my daughter is living proof that birthcontrol doesn't always work. So a girl that was raped while on birthcontrol becomes pregnant and has an abortion you are calling her too lazy? I mean there are a lot of different situations in which both are best choices due to circumstances. Or if a guy that you have been with says he wants children you get pregnant and then he takes off not wanting anything to do with you or the baby leaving you w/ nothing and you can barely take care of yourself. Adoption isnt easy either.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Sperm die any way whether in a condom or still in a testicle. If you don't get rid of the sperm so new sperm can be made then your levels will drop off and can cause infertility. As For it being the same as abortion no its not at all. Abortion your killing a baby that has already been made. Birth control your not doing anything really. He either has sex with a condom or has a night emission. By your thinking every time you have a period your killing a baby. A sperm and egg aren't a baby until they combine.|`|b5JnSBstaa	Even if a woman is not taking birth control, most sperm die anyway. The vagina has a very acidic PH level.  They go from millions to mere thousands of sperm cells that would actually meet the egg.  Should my vagina feel guilty for killing sperm? I think not, thats just how it is.  Birth control pills do not kill sperm, they stop a woman from ovulating and thickening cervical mucus.  Also, if a man jerks off, should he feel guilty that he is killing his poor little sperm cells? Definately, no.  Birth control prevents pregnancy so women don't have to have an abortion, which kills a live embryo.|`|Ih3dd3R8aa	think you christian psychos should take your baby murder BS and shove it where the sun don't shine.|`|KzNoxRwbaa	abortion is wayy worse|`|Ti9piGD0aa	I prefer the idea of birth control|`|c5n6rFEnaa	In my opinion killing "sperm" as you say is completely different then killing a living breathing thing. But that is me.Everyone opinion is totally different. But this is mine. By the way condoms break.|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	Having an abortion is killing a BABY... killing sperm is killing a pair of chromosomes... bit of a difference there, mate!
BzYbEa6Taa	I think that your sister needs her face slapped, how ever a call to CPS or what ever might be in order because she can get into hell for abandonment.    On the other hand your niece needs this as you said, and it is a big decision but in the end you are the one that has to live with your decision either way you decide it.    You could look at it as if she stays Emma can share a room with her and she can help with the ne baby if not and the situation back home is bad for you as her aunt you need to notify the proper authority so that things can get fixed.    I've had 2 sets of parents abandon me and it's not a good feeling or a good thing..    Good luck Either way,  ~A~|`|eya1WDS4aa	Tell her the truth. Tell her she is being a horrible mother and that she has kids and she needs to take care of her kids. That her kids should be number 1 and not her social life.  I would also say that she shouldn't separate the kids. they need to be together.  If she is sending her daughter off to live with someone else because she cant handle her kids then yes is abandoment.  A mother should be able to handle her kids, it shouldnt be a big burden.|`|KvguovfWaa	You must remember that, as a mother, your first priority is to your own children and if your niece is in anyway going to disturb their lives negatively then I would say put your foot down.  Your niece may be a bit of a bad influence on your other 14 year old.|`|alJA3jyCaa	Tell her directly --"Sorry about your situation but I can't have anymore people here. So no to your request"|`|9Q2jwVSTaa	not your problem hard as it would be for you to say that its the truth|`|uCjJ5P4Laa	no one can make this decision for you. If money is the issue i would legally adopt the child and see if you can get any govt money. Dont make this decision based on what any one else tells you this is more personal than that.
jVrONM3laa	In the end when were all old looks arnt going to matter, memories and happiness will.  The best looking man or women can have the ugliest personality and in your eyes can make them look like a monster and someone whos not so attractive can have a good personality and be really fun to be around and that person will look like a super model in your eyes.|`|ieusQoDRaa	Yes, you do, honestly.  I mean, what first causes you to stop and look at a girl?  If she's is pretty, you look, you wanna know her.  The girls who had personality, you waited to find that out to wanna date them.  So, people always judge each other, even if its just first impressions.  Its the people who make their ideas, but don't let that keep them from still talking to or having contact with that person that are not judgmental.  So yes, people do judge people based on appearance.  Just let your actions prove them wrong.|`|mjjhTUVEaa	to be realistic, I prolly would judge someone, even though i don't want to, appearances are such a big part of our society.|`|W0A39Ysjaa	yes thats a really big part for me acctulley! i don't date ugly people but i couldn't tell if someone is a player or not.....so i just judge people on there uglyness :)|`|KtJELbPzaa	Aww yuh seem awesome to me......I need to find a guy like yuh|`|d5K8wORqaa	good for you for not judging.  my friend shes such a bit*h i mean shes not even that pretty and she only dates "cute" guys and in my opinion they are the ugliest guys i ever seen and all the do is play her and she always ends up w. a broken heart. and honestly i dont care and if shes being a bit*h and only goes after guys for looks then she gets what she is asking for.  i have another friend who has been with her boyfriend for 13 months today and they are soo happy and i know it wasent all about looks cause he isnt that good looking and she knows it, he has the biggest nose ever. lol.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	no i dont.    she better not look like a whore tho!!|`|WGAFP6mSaa	I agree with 'chloe ? charlotte' all the way.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yes, looks are a factor in whether I date someone or not, but I don't judge the first time I see someone, and automatically assume he's an a**hole.|`|JduQHocdaa	No, personality is the better option,because looks come&go!|`|rAkWoweOaa	If apperances didn't matter to you, then you wouldn't have that nice pic of you in the profile! : )|`|cY8DgJv5aa	To a degree, yes.  Physical attraction is one of the first factors in a relationship.  If I'm in a bar and I see this dirty, toothless, 'ugly', hairy guy.... I'm not gonna think, "Wow.  I wanna meet him!"  Appearance does matter to a degree.  He may be a wonderfully kind and intelligent person, but without that first initial physical attraction, I may not approach him in the beginning.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	If i said that appearance didnt matter i would be lieing. Of course i judge on personality more, but yes i also do look at appearance too.|`|7ZNRqKbKaa	i do to an extent. i have to be attracted by atleast something( eyes, smile, etc.). i go a lot by personality though. all my friends say i go for the nerds so apparently i have bad taste. haha.|`|gILygKvRaa	you do look playerish. only bcuz of ur head tilt thing. nice bod ;] ahem. ANYWAYS not always.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	yeah mostly how they act though. ppl who say no are usually lying|`|fsVX6Udxaa	I probably only judge like 10% out of 100% for guys I would date. It depends mostly on personality for me.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Yes. Because physical attraction is what gets a connection started unless you start were friends first.    I like people to look approachable when the are trying to get close to me.|`|cIPziIdnaa	I think for any relationship to work, there has to be a pretty strong initial physical attraction... but for the relationship to last long term, there needs to be so much more:  mostly trust, communication, common interests and values, and just enjoying each other's company like you are the very best of friends.|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	no, i dont..|`|ZAppRn5Faa	i congratulate you for not judging. but i think you have to be somewhat attracted to a persons appearance. like you wouldnt date someone just for there personality. i mean you'd look for both.|`|4TXQje2Daa	i hate when people say looks dont matter cus they do. If you are looking for a hot person then thats wat you will get.  If you claim that you dont care about looks and then go out with an ugly person then yes you still care about the looks. You are hoping that the ugly person will have a good personality cus if they dont have one then they gotta have the other.    everyone cares about looks.|`|MBSrbJuAaa	It's mostly personality, but there is some of an attraction to the appearance of a person.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	i think u should seek someone w a balance i mean not a obesy girl but nor a anorexic one itsby she should be able to talk abt something more thn parties n la vida loca so ...
qYNCV6L1aa	I couldn't personally be friends with someone who treated their children this way. I wouldn't want my own child around her. And the sad reality of it is, that's just how some people are with their children. And if there is no abuse going on then you can't report a parent for "disciplining" their child no matter how extreme you think it may be. It's truly a sad story and I feel for that little girl because there's no telling what this will do to her mentally/emotionally but in no way would I be friends with that woman.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I could definitely not be friends with someone like the woman you met.  She sounds awful, and I feel bad for her little girl.  <br>  <br>  However, I have not yet lost friends over parenting styles.  Notice I say yet!  Who knows what crazy things are going to come out once more of my friends have kids!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I certainly couldn't be friends with that woman, that isn't just a parenting disagreement it is 100% bad parenting.<br>  <br>  I have friends who are pro-cry it out, we disagree on small issues like that and we are still friends. This woman sounds awful.|`|sAwmwynnaa	She's hardly a friend, just someone you know from a web site, but stay in contact with her and try to change her parenting 'skills'|`|ewXsugqgaa	dont see her again she would be a bad influence on your child, i feel sorry for the little girl|`|s2wJQqK7aa	Wow is all I can really say!!   I don't know how you didn't smack the lady!!!!  I couldn't stand to be there and see that.  I do have a friend who parents VERY differently then I do - she spanks, screams, swears at them where I do not.  I've been friends with her for a very long time so its hard for me to walk away but I don't see her very often because I can't stand to see that and I avoid her phone calls because I cannot stand to hear her scream at her children.  Do what you think is right, if you can't stand to be there and see that you can say something (which will more then likely cause a problem) or just walk away.  All the best!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I would cut off all contact with that woman now...poor little girl though...you can't be socialising with someone like that!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Good grief I certainly wouldn't stay friendly with her. Poor child.<br>  I have a cousin who allows her dog to lick her children's faces (7yo, 3yo) which I find disgusting, and when my daughter was being held by the 7yo when she was 4 weeks old, this dog came right up to my daughter's face and would've licked her if I hadn't intervened. My cousin didn't stop her dog cos she couldn't see a problem with it!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I wouldn't want to be friends with her. I think you need to confront her about it.|`|NjeN7Lc9aa	oh my god at 3 years they understand everything. i would never talk 2 her again.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	I could deal with friends who don't parent their children the way I do except on one condition.  If they come into my home, they very well must mind me.  If their parents undermine the rules of my home, then that would be the end of the friendship.<br>  <br>  A parent may let their child reek havoc in their bedroom while they jump on the bed and mess up the comforter and sheets, but if the parent doesn't say anything when the child tries to do the same in my own home, that would have to end.<br>  <br>  I had a friend bring her child over to my house one time and he kept on wanting to go into the basement unsupervised.  First, we had antique guns stored down there that I didn't want him playing with and secondly, our cat box was down there and I didn't want him in the box.  The child kept on repeatedly going down there over and over.  I'm sure you've heard the parent uses when they say, "No, no, don't go down there," which doesn't sound like much of a warning...well it didn't work.<br>  <br>  That was the last time they were welcome over to my house.  I've heard of kids being rude behind their parents back, but this kid was rude in front of his mother.  I had made dinner for the both of them.  For him, I especially made Macaroni and Cheese and because it wasn't Kraft, he wouldn't eat it.  <br>  <br>  Not the same situation like you've experienced, but the pendulum does swing strongly in the other direction.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Wow, I definitely couldn't be friends with her.<br>  <br>  I can be friends with people who just parent differently to me, everyone has their own opinions on what's best.  Me and my sister are really different in our outlooks, but we still get on well! <br>  <br>  There's a difference between having different views on what's best, and just being a BAD parent, and I don't see how you could be friends with her if you've got to watch her behaving this way towards her daughter.
7SKVCPcSaa	the not married part isn't the part that worries me.   its the fact that she lives with her parents. they help support her. she lives in (at the most) a 3 bedroom home (or at least thats what the neighborhood houses are known to be.. 2-3 bedrooms only), she isn't working, and some doctor was stupid enough to help her get pregnant with 8 babies! and not to mention the welfare rumors. if you can't take care of kids, then you shouldn't be having them.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	None of my business.    *I don't have any 'personal feelings about it' because its none of my business.  I don't waste my time worrying about other people's lives.  Especially someone I don't know, never will know and hasn't impacted my life at all.  I don't see how having that many children, how she got that many children nor her marital status should be something that I have 'personal feelings about'.  I'm not trying to be rude.  I'm just stating my opinion.  You asked me what I thought about it and that's what I think.  I think its none of my business.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I think she may be a bit crazy. But, as long as she loves them and takes care of them then thats alright by me.|`|FA710vETaa	i think it is no ones freakin business leave her the hell alone crap!!! Lets all freak out because she wants a big family?|`|CL4p7fccaa	Its not the ' is not married ' part that is the problem - plenty of people in relationships are not married to their partner.    The issue here is SHE HAS NO PARTNER she is a single mom to ALL her children.    Sick & so is the Dr who implanted 8 enbryos - cats & dogs are designed to have litters - humans are not.|`|AA10027086	agreed, none of my business...to each their own!    and FYI- it's not like they decided to have 8 babies!! it doesn't work that way-the doctor just didn't magically make it happen. the goal was 1 and with any fertility treatments there is always the possibility for multiples|`|KSf9t0Vnaa	that is really weird i cant believe she isnt married, but i geuss its just like getting pregnant with one kid you cant control how many kids you hav in one birth. lol|`|a7eE92RPaa	eh, it's her business.     It's not something I'd do myself, and I could care less about it.    I agree with the chick underneath me. Uber uncool if this lady is pumping out all these kids and getting mega money from the government since she can't support them.    Why couldn't she just adopt or be a foster parent?|`|59M4xUwXaa	It was her decision and what's done is done. I personally wouldn't even think of having that many children and then providing for them and caring for them all by myself. But, to each her own. I just hope she has alot of help.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	i just hope that she is not living off the tax payers money for all of these kids. I can understand a mother's want to have kids, but i think i agree with the grandmother that this is enough. I have watched all the shows on the duggars, the ones with 18 kids, and that is great for them, they are self sufficent, And they wanted to have this many kids on their own, without help. But i think that even with invitro you can control how many are put in but not how many actually take. So i think she needs to give it a rest and be thankful for the ones that she has and hopefully will not have anymore anytime soon.

dXMdt3gVaa	I honestly think whenever you get pregnant will be the best time to get pregnant. Because you can try to control things as much as possible but you never know when you will fall pregnant (it took me 4 months this last time even though I thought I knew exactly when I was supposed to ovulate) and you never know how your body is going to react to being pregnant. So you may never experience morning sickness. Or it may come in your second and last trimester. Or you may have it the whole way through (like I had). You may feel perfect being pregnant. You may have no side effects. Or you may develop some serious complications. I would just say let it happen when it happens. And dont stress too much about 'what if?' because you honestly cannot control it and you will make yourself sick from worry. I would just say see what happens and deal with issues if and when they happen. I have had many friends go through teaching practicals pregnant and they have been fine! I also was in college when I was pregnant and I got a 4.0 GPA. And I was sick as a dog with morning sickness! I think whatever you put your mind to doing, you will accomplish no matter what!|`|MXXOICquaa	if we arent supposed to answer get pregnant while your student teaching you know everyones answers get pregnant before, i really dont think it matters either way but being pregnant makes you forget alot of things and the farther along you get the worse it gets so if your going to be teaching and taking finals and needing to remember things wait to get pregnant while your teaching and plus it makes you super tired and you have all those appointments at the end of pregnancy so id wait as late as possible if not after even though you didnt want to hear that

vzYZWiPyaa	hey  first off, let me start  off by saying congrats...  i'm a pregnant teen also  (17 years old) expecting my  baby around may. =)  but ummm, what you should  do is tell your parents asap,  although they may be a bit  mad or disappointed, you need  to let them know because you will  need their support during all of this.  and i would also recommend you telling  the father of your unborn child, since he plays  a huge role in this. be sure  to schedule you an appointment with  a OB/GYN so that they can let you know  how far along you may be and get you started  on your prenatal vitamins and other things that  you will need to have done.  start putting money back  for things that you will have to buy soon   (diapers, baby clothes, ect.) and above all keep  your head up regardless of what anyone has  to say about you. in the end everything will be ok =)  much love and god bless|`|IA7e21goaa	The first thing you have to do is tell your parents. I know its hard but you have to. I have been there im 15 and pregnant,i had to tell my parents.They were mad but they love me and are going to stand by me. Just sit them down and talk to them. You also need to deside wether you will keep the baby or not. Also you may want to get started on some prenatal vitamins.|`|dQF5jOiLaa	You should NOT GO to planned parenthood.  That place is A living hell.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	im almost 21..single...with twins.  my advise is talk to your parents and family and friends. get all the support you can get.|`|jHuQjrzOaa	1st off talk to your parents and father of the baby see what there advice to you is...  i know its going to be hard to tell them if you haven't already...  i was 17 when i found out i was pregnant and i was due yesterday i am now 18 and all the things that i worried about then don't seem to bother me anymore...i have a wonderful baby boy on the way... GOOD LUCK   if you need to talk hit me up and ill be more then willing to talk...ive been in the same boat|`|9yeyzQi5aa	What is your situation like???|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	you probably didnt get many answers before because theres really nothing you can do now. just go get pre natal care.if your under 16 and cant get a job yet ask your parents if they will financially suppport you and your baby. if your over 16 get a job and start saving. book in for an ultrasound and blood tests, and buy some pre-natal vitamins.  good luck and congrats|`|uiRdhx3saa	im 18 years old & almost 18 weeks pregnant. i was shocked when i found out, but luckily ive had nothing but support from my family. the first thing i did was have a blood test to confirm the pregnancy, which you should be able to do at a doctors office or hospital. then talk to your parents. i talked to my mom first because shes like my best friend. ever since then ive just been taking things as they come. realize it wont be easy, but it will definitely be worth it whenever you get to hold your baby. most importantly don't use this as a reason to quit school. a baby is even more of a reason to go to college and get a career|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	You have 3 options. Explore them all.|`|25c6d5700e6137614608981bc5f7d45daa	im 17 & expecting in september . tell you parents & talk to the father of the baby .|`|eemmWU0Haa	maybe you should talk to your parents or go to planned parenthood? that's what everyone says around here but here in Canada we don't got that stuff around here...Good Luck.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Go tell your parents if you can't tell them face to face leave a letter and put it whenever tey after go to. Then go to your room. Please don't get an abortion, this is not the babies fault why should it suffer from what you did. Be honest , I am a teen and am still virgin|`|yYOh0DUjaa	You could go to planned parenthood first and talk to them. They will help you decide. You will need to talk to your parents eventually. And more than likely you will need to tell the father of the baby.|`|kV9YT6bSaa	Stay strong. Keep it.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	First off tell your parents. Then make an appointment with a doctor to start your prenatal care. Then you just go from there... :) I got pregnant as a teen also so if you need support/help feel free to send me a message! Good luck!|`|mLbydsVIaa	well im a teen mommy too expecting in May and  when i found out i was pregnant i went to a doctor and got my prenatal vitamins. im definitly keeping it...i never had a thought of abortion and i never will...hope u do the same   hope this helps & if you need any advice e-mail me :)|`|6C4ibyF8aa	well i'm 15 and i'm 20 weeks pregnant. the first thing i did was told my mom, even though i didn't want to, i needed to get it over with. then my mom just took me to doctor appointments. there isn't really a lot to do.|`|hvbExOmfaa	Start planning for the future... will you be able to financially support yourself and the child? Is the father still around? You can either prepare yourself to have the baby or... you know. No matter what anyone thinks, you know what you need and what's best for you.
tkkYIdIvaa	My son is only one but I can do me I guess because I am 18. I am Mean Girl and Popular|`|nfzQkvqraa	I am proud to say that my daughter (who is only 7) is not in a clique.  She is herself.  She has friends.  And she is very happy with that.  I hope to God that she is not trying to find her way out of things by high school.  I hope that she knows that she is no better than anyone else when it comes to consequences of her actions.  It sounds like you lived it up in school.  But did you learn from it?  Because your behavior was wrong. Even more so, the behavior of those around you were wrong for letting you get away with it was a disservice to you.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter is six, she doesn't fit in with one certain group. She likes everyone.|`|bufQfEqbaa	Sounds like you haven't grown up from that.  So are you one of these forty year old women who reached their peak in high school and now regret not doing anything with your life?|`|PpvEOjY7aa	Sooo proud ... wow ... you make it sound like some huge achievement ... hmmmm ... I would give my daughter the attention she needed so that she didn't feel the need to play up.  No repercussions for your actions?  Sounds like noone really cared ... I'm sad for you ... I hope the rugby & swimming turned out better for you ....|`|s2JvJ5alaa	I'm 16 years old and a sophomore in highschool.  I'm a cheerleader(pom actually. And for those of you who don't know, that's just like a cheerleader except we dance instead of tumble) And I'm gonna say I'm pretty popular.   I'm just wondering why you're asking this question...|`|prqrQcd1aa	I have 3 girls, and i hope to GOD that they are never part of your "clique"    You sound a little too proud to have done all of those things. Swimming and playing rugby are great, all the rest they can do with out. I want them to be respectable people when they grow up, not full of themselves!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter is a mix.  She's very popular, but not in a mean girl way.  Everyone likes her because she's nice to everyone.  She hangs out with people from all different groups.  She's been voted "class favorite", homecoming princess, etc.  She's a cheerleader, but she's an athlete, too - gymnastics and track.  Dating the same guy (football player) for the last 3 years.  And she's also brainy (3rd in her class of 650) and has a lot of friends in the "nerd" group. Teachers love her. So I don't know - just plain old all-around popular, I guess?    My son is... I don't know.  He plays football, baseball and soccer, but he's also kind of geeky (big computer game nerd).  He doesn't hang with the popular kids, but they do like him; he just prefers to hang with his few long-time close friends.  I guess he's just an average kid - and he's happy with who he is, which is all I could ask for.|`|1YaHn28Yaa	Welli am brainyish-kinda popular
c55O7jqXaa	Well first of all for this litle girls well being she needs stability in her life right now and if that means staying with one parent all the time with visits from others than that is how it needs to be. Shifting her from home to home or the thoughts of that is enough to cause her stress.     The clawing is just a coping mechanism. I can only imagine what might be going thru her litle mind. Just because she is only 6 doesn't mean she can't or doesn't feel all the same stresses and sorow that do. She may not understand fully, but she is old enough to understand that when a person dies they aren't coming back and I am sure she can feel and see the sorrow in her Dad's and StepMoms eyes and  hear it in their voices and hears all the conversations that are going on. There is no hiding that.     She needs to continue to be in counseling. She needs to be with you 99% of the time and your ex husband needs to understand this. This is for your own Daughter's safety and wellbeing. You need to try to get her to open up and talk and also give her an out for the clawing. Have her so something more productive to deal with all the pain and anger that might be bottled up inside.     Maybe a special light receiving blanket that she can throw around and ball up and even chew on or rip and tear at, but one that is strong enough to withstand some anking on. Maybe even a large pillow that she can bury her feelings into when she feels the need. She needs to know that she can openly cry. To yell and kick and scream and get all these feelings out in the open so she can begin to heal. Heh us adults need that.     Know that she will act out in ways she may have never before. You can expect almost anything from a person no matter the age when they have lost someone in the family.    Have lots of patience with her. Maybe even the Father and StepMom could use some counseling themselves.     I will pray for your little girl and pray for the family. I pray that God can open their eyes and heal their hearts.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Well first of all, it doesn't sound like she is ready to be out of counseling.  Get back in touch with her therapist and get her back in there.  It also sounds like her dad should be involved in her therapy so he can understand exactly what is going on.  Additionally, keeping her away from her dad and stepmom altogether isn't going to help anything.  Eventually,  she is going to have to see them and be in their home, and no matter how long she stays away it is going to be difficult.  The three of you need to help ease her through this process by having them visit her at your home for a while, then all three of you in public, fun places for a while, then just them and her on a day outing visit, then eventually back to their house.|`|AA10250756	You need to get her back into counseling. Most medical plans will pay for that.|`|eHHp4tulaa	Her dad has a right to see her. But ask if he would consider moving from that house. I understand why the baby would feel that way. You also need his cooperation to help her. good luck to you.|`|f0eQ5ILEaa	you should definitely get some professional help on this regard.  See another counselor.  It is a big responsibility.|`|CLvc8teXaa	Well, this seems like a very serious case. This may sound very weird, but, you should try and see if her father would maybe not take your daughter to his home as often. Maybe he can take her to a park and have a picnic. Also I think you should maybe wait a week or so and see if she still claws herself. Then, maybe put her into counseling but don't take her a lot. Maybe limit it to once a week. After all, she's only six. I hope this helps. :)|`|okh3hL8taa	Your child's father needs to talk with his daughter, rather than get angry with you.  I suggest you tell him to talk with his child and get the answers from her.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You need to seek professional help.|`|623zz8d7aa	Who is her dad concerned about anyway? Himself only? Sure, he's grieving, but she is, too, and two grieving people are both needy. Tell him the counselor suggests she have time to heal before she goes back over there. It's sad anyone should have to go through the loss of a child, but this child needs help getting through it or she'll pay the rest of her life. Get her more counseling. Suggest he and his wife get some help, too.    I speak from experience.|`|bFWhuJbuaa	aw! how sad. the cawing might be her way of letting out her anger. what worked for me when i was younger and mad was i would do a sport and it would tke my mind away from everything bad, and focus all my energy on the task at hand. tell her dad that you arent keeping her away from him, but your keeping hr away from getting upset. maybe ou could invite the father over to see her so she doesnt have to go over there. i am so sorry this happened    xox A|`|AA11209831	It seems to me that if you have a situation with a child as serious as this one seems to be that you would contact a professional for help and not a random group of strangers on the internet.    But, I don't have kids, so maybe I'm wrong, maybe strangers on the internet is the best place for help in this situation.
0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Oh Kt, I don't know if you can gain custody of the child.  You and your husband may want to consider talking with the couple.  If the mother is clinically depressed this may be the reason for her not taking good care of the child.  With her putting the child in its crib all day.  That is neglect.  Maybe you can offer to pick up the baby almost on a daily basis.  Tell her its to help get your baby fix.  I don't know, I truelly don't know.  I've known of a child where his mother was completely irresponsible.  But there wasn't anything I could do because there were grandparents that were willing to take over.  <br>  Ask her if there is something wrong.  Ask why she pays more attention to the older child than the younger.  <br>  If she can't afford it, offer to buy the baby an exersaucer.  <br>  But the only other thing you can do is call DCFS.  No child should be neglected.  And Bravo for you wanting to step up to the plate for an innocent child.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You could and should definitely report her to child protective services if you really feel the baby is not being treated properly.  However, the chances of you actually being able to get custody of that child are very slim.  Your friend's husband seems interested in his children, and I'm sure she and/or her husband have family members that might be able to take the child.  Good luck.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	legal there nothing u can do unless mum and dad give him to u with all the paper work  but maybe it time to call social services they can try to help the family or take the kid into foster care if he was taking into foster care maybe u could talk to your friend about letting u have him it's all i can think of|`|DtBE35wHaa	KT ? most definitely call cps and let them know that your would be interested in taking care of this child, good luck and prayers to you and yours|`|Ov9qM1gdaa	no, you could call child care services to bring it to there attention though.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	Unfortunately you have no legal rights to the child, unless the parents would willingly give you custody.  The only thing you can really do is cal CPS on your friend for neglect.  If they feel that the child needs to be removed from the home you may be able to try to gain the child through foster care.  <br>  Are the only signs of autism developmental delays or are there other signs as well?  If he is being left in a crib all day that could be the reason for developmental delays.|`|RzYePezkaa	I know it is a difficult situation but no you could not get custody of this child you have to be a family member in order to get custody if you have concerns for the child's safety you can call DCF or CPS depending on your area you live in they will come out and investigate for signs of abuse or neglect.You still would not gain custody though if abuse was founded and you may lose your friends in the process of making this report.|`|zATQaiwIaa	I highly doubt the couple will hand over their child - you would have to go through CPS, and they would have to see that there was negligence. PLus they would take the older child as well - are you prepared to shower 2 children with love?  plus if there is not enough evidence you would be ripping the children away from their family and putting them through stress.<br>  <br>  I agree if what you saying is true is very wrong of the mother - maybe she is depressed - but it sounds like something needs to be done.|`|h93SVSxLaa	The only way you'll ever have custody of this child is if she signs it over to you and from the sound of it it's not gonna happen. Call CPS on her if you're really that concerned.|`|qZINunh7aa	Yes, if you have other witness who can verify neglect there is a chance you can gain custody.|`|J5QlJpVwaa	Social services would take both kids if neglect was found and try to place them with relatives first. If that didn't work then they would be placed in a foster home . You have very little chance of gaining custody and if you did get them to sign over legal custody they could come back months later and take the child back. I had legal custody of five year old twins for 4 months until their mother decided she wanted them back and it was terrible. if this child were to come into your home your bond would grow even stronger and if they came back to take him it would rip your heart out. Call social services about the neglect and walk away. Do your crying now and try to go on with your life. I spent over five years worrying and crying over the twins because their birth mom did not take good care of them and they lived in an area were the judge did not believe in taking kids no matter how many black eyes they came to school with. If you want children consider a foster/adoption program that's what my husband and I are doing.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	well its not likely that you will get custody of this child. If the house he lives in is unfit and unsafe for him, then a call to cps is best at this point. If the child is taken away, they will search with in the family for a gaurdian first. Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles etc.<br>  If you think you are able to confront the mother about her parenting and ask her to sign custody over to you, that is an option, but do you think she will hand it over, or do you think she will resent you and you will end a friendship? There is two kids that need to be put into concideration, and i think the only reason the older one gets more attention is because he is more independant then the one year old. To remove one child from the home because of neglet, but not the other one is a whole new set of issues.<br>  You need to think very hard about this, do you want to risk loosing her as a friend before having to call CPS or would you rather just call cps, and inform the family, if it comes to it, that you are more then willing to take gaurdianship if no one else is willing to.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	The first thing is to report the Mother to the authorities...she sounds disturbed...you could offer to have the baby stay with you overnight to "give her a break" and then do it more and more often...thank God the baby has you looking out for him...good luck.,|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would call cps and see if they can come and then maybe you could adopt the child. I would talk to them about it.|`|uLQIZKLyaa	adopt your own baby form an adoption center, then report child neglect and talk about the situation with your friends husband.. i think trying to gain total custody of a child without first even doing those things is way too extreme.|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	If you're really worried about this child then call child services and let them know what is going on so they can in investigate the issue. Has your friend said anything about not wanting the child or not being able to care for it? Just tell your friend you are worried about the baby and ask her if she needs help but I wouldn't bring up adopting him unless she says something about it first.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	You are evil..wow people like you make me sick. You are just friends with the person to have their baby.  I wonder how you would act as an enemy.  <br>  <br>  So ok. You want to have a baby, if you call DSS or whatever, what will happen is that they will investigate and IF they see that the mother is unfit they will give the baby to the father OR THE GRANDPARENTS.  EASY AS THAT. THEY WILL NOT GIVE IT TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT BLOOD RELATED. Sorry, you are just going to have to adopt.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Okay so your not going to be able to walk up to the parents and tell them you want their baby, I'm sure they would never give it to you. You would have to call CPS, and tell them that you think the child is neglected, but CPS deals more with extreme abuse and things like that. So the chances of the children getting taken away are slim to none. And if the children do get away CPS will offer them to family members first, your not blood related so I doubt the children would ever be offered to you, if they did get taken away you wold probably have to go through an adoption agency to get them. She sounds like a frustrated mother, maybe offer to help her, and babysit a few days a week. That gives the baby some attention and helps the mother have some time to herself.
kk8ypSTSaa	life is DEF worth livin for... U know...i can kinda of relate... sometimes i get how you feel... i have had a lot of unfair things happen in my life, too.. i get down sometimes but i always think to myself that my life COULD be a whole lot worse.... life wasnt made to be easy.. it wasnt made to be from one mountain top to the other.... u gotta get thru the valleys.... i know its so hard.. believe me i do.... especially if you have friends who never really had to struggle a day in their life... i know.... BUT you know our greatest glory in life is not what we achieve... its RISING everytime we fail.. makes us all the more stronger & all the more better.... if you really feel like you want to end your life, talk to friends.. talk to family... or better yet.. talk to a dr.... i know how you feel...i know you are thinking that a lot of what people are writing sound cliche but they are so true... its hard to see that when you are so down.. .. i get that.... & i know it is proablly a daily struggle for you.... change your outlook.. happiness is a choice.... i hope you choose to be happy... i wish you the best life has to offer... i wish you continued strength to fight these feelings that you are having... know even tho im a stranger... we may never meet or talk again but i do care for you & say that your LIFE is most certainly worth living for !!!! best of luck.... take care;)|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Therapy helps.|`|gILygKvRaa	yeah, that's all.|`|AA10034051	Sounds like you need some therapy. Speak to your parents right away|`|HLEID89maa	maybe ur bipolar?|`|d67ULZQ6aa	Same here kid, I always grew up really quiet and feeling the same way you do. I've done alot of crazy things... ever drank bleach? Don't do it, it burns the f***out of your throat. When I got into high school that changed alot, I got a boyfriend, got into new things and it helped out alot. Although still to this day if I get sad I get really messed up. And like you I never was beat as a child, just had a step dad I really hated and I always was crying as a child because of him and I felt my mom didn't care because she never stoped him from yelling at me. If I were you I would find something you enjoy. Video games, reading, a new tv show, talking on the phone. Find something to do to keep your mind off things.|`|ieusQoDRaa	Nothing is wrong with you...just keep trying to be better every day, be positive, do things that you want, set goals, play sports..things will get better one day.|`|fPxUdKZEaa	I suggest some therapy,Or going to the doctors.|`|ulzuIXkSaa	I don't think you're anti-social.  You're just quiet and shy like me....you just have to be more open to meeting new people because it helps A LOT.    I have a friend that I talk to when I feel sad, and he told me that in order to change you have to be aggressive.  You have to be so angry with yourself and with your life that you will actually do something to try to change it.     Please don't think I mean suicide because I don't. I mean like angry that you want to change so you start talking to more people and getting involved in school activities.  You know, things like that to try to change the ways things are now.
FiUprYsvaa	No. Of course not.    but fuckmastersupreme would be over the line.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	no its not like ur calling him something dirt.... its something sweet and innocent, when my son gets a boo boo i call him honey too... honey where does it hurt... or here honey mommy will kiss it, there all better...|`|tkkYIdIvaa	No, it's not, and I don't see why or how it could be.|`|zATQaiwIaa	I think i call him "honey" more than his actual name...our daughter knows him as Daddy.|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	No|`|hl5WdXnbaa	No, how would it affect a child negatively? If anything it is good for a child to see their parents showing love to each other ( love, not sex of course lol)|`|qNf0A4V4aa	no. just dont let him give you names like manhole, or cockpit. they will figure it out.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	not at all.. being a loving caring family in front of your kids is a good thing|`|3Psi4kBxaa	No.|`|M6c0hUefaa	No, why shouldn't a loving couple show their affection for one another through nicknames?...As long as they aren't saying sexual things in front of their children it's appropriate.|`|dPULl5hjaa	no|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	of course its not. its a term of endearment, not a sexual term...geez! its really important to show affection to your husband in front of your children, they need to know that mommy and daddy still love each other, esp in this crazy world where statistically 1/2 of their friends come from broken homes with divorced parents. it reassures them that they are in a strong, close-knit family when their parents show affection to each other, and makes them feel secure. i think this is very important!!|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	no|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, not at all|`|rAkWoweOaa	no|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	no there going to hear it some day might as well hear it at home|`|AA12204338	Absolutely not!  I think it teaches your child how to communicate in a marriage.  It should be warm and loving and not cold and distant.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	No, there is nothing wrong with it as long as they are not talking sexual. I rather my kids hear me show affection towards my husband than them hear me fight with him. Think of it that way.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Showing a child that it is okay to show affection is fine in my book. They tend to grow up less cold as people!|`|K5TrkUhCaa	No, I don't see it as inappropriate. I call my husband 'honey' all the time in front of my kids. The kids always call him 'daddy'. They know the difference.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No. It's a sign of affection, that's all
giRRCXU4aa	I found out I was pregnant when I was 4 weeks. I had no symptoms. The only thing that pushed me to take a test was the fact that I had missed my period.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Possibly pregnant?...Why don't you just pee on a stick?...then you can ask yourself all those questions..|`|1KppBoKnaa	Just because u had sex does not mean you are 100% pregnant.    Did you take a test and get a positive?    Every pregnancy is different, so different people have different symptoms. Noone can tell you when you should feel different and what to feel.    I had no early symptoms other than cramps for a month and no period. I actually didnt feel pregnant until i could feel movement.     Good luck.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I found out at 4 weeks and didnt have any symptoms at all. Didnt even realize I missed my period.    Every girl is different when they get their symptoms.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Some women feel nauseous at 4 weeks, but plenty do not. I didn't get any symptoms whatsoever until 8 weeks. You could take a pregnancy test, and the result would be accurate at this point. Good luck!
W1p6LetFaa	At four weeks pregnant, I didn't FEEL pregnant at all.  At about 6 weeks or so, I suddenly became SO exhausted... More tired than I had ever been in my entire life.  I actually had to announce at work that I was pregnant pretty early because I was falling asleep at my computer constantly.  At about 7 weeks, I had a little spotting, which is totally normal. Then at about 9 weeks (a little later than most women), the morning sickness kicked in and last until about week 13, but it wasn't bad at all. Only every other day or even every 3 days.  But that was the worst of it! The rest of my pregnancy has been a breeze!    Congrats and best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|pR4nLjyRaa	I didn't feel anything at 4 weeks, alot of women don't. Around 5 weeks nausea and breast tenderness kicked in followed by food aversions and a decreased appetite. Congrats on your pregnancy!

Yesterday I felt pregnant. Today I don't. I am 4 weeks as well. It comes and goes. I had no energy yesterday, I cleaned the whole house and went shopping today. I played with my 14 month old son quite a bit. And I'm still going strong. I feel awesome. And I hope this continues for the majority of my pregnancy. I am sitting here, wondering, am I even prego?     Hope you have an awesome one.|`|EA32AsZZaa	Well the only thing that really tipped me off that I may be pregnant is the fact that I had tan spotting a week or so before my period..which lasted only for an hour (Implantation).  I did notice that I was extrememly tired however, and if I didn't have something in my stomach at all times I was nauseous!  I am now around 8 weeks, and my breasts are like rocks!  You are right..it all depends on the person, but most symptoms are universal!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	at 5 weeks is when i really started feeling things like throwing up all day long and boobs started to hurt...     but like you said it is different for everyone
hSTNMnFPaa	It doesn't come from the states- the state names come from a Native American tribe. It means "friend" or "ally" in the Dakota language.<br>  ?

4jOaN0WIaa	Yes, I had one done. I was only 27 but the doctor thought my daughter had a severe birth defect and we wanted to be sure. Not that I would have aborted the pregnancy but I just wanted to be prepared. It really wasn't painful. It was a little uncomfortable. I was a little sore after. I just took it really easy for the next couple of days and didn't overexert myself in any way. My doctor was a high risk doctor so the risk of miscarriage was extremely rare. I would have a specialist do your amnio. It is common for blood work to show abnormalities. Don't worry until you know what is what. I bet that everything will be fine.|`|AA10629038	I had one because I needed to be induced so they wanted to make sure the lungs were developed enough. It really was not that bad, just don't look at the needle cause it is quite long. It really just has a little prick and then its over.|`|1G97OBNEaa	I had it done and it really was way better than I thought it would be.  For me it was virtually painless and I had no after effects either.  It was over quickly.  It was just a little pinch when the needle went in and then before you know it it's over and you are on your way.  Good luck with everything and not to worry, it's not bad at all.|`|irGE84Qdaa	same thing happened to me and i refused to take the test as it has slight chance of miscarriage and the blood test is always not positive i mean its always not right this is what everybody told me but still its up to u cuz it was hard for me to remove my baby if he has any abnormality + if i dont do that i would be so worried what would happen when he,ll born so i left everything on GOD and now i m 35 weeks pregnant my 2nd level ultrasound was fine there wasn't anything abnormal so i just refused taking the test.but if u wanna have it its up to u and its not that painfull this is what i heard.

YNr4tZt1aa	if they took your blood, they would have analysed it to see if they could draw any conclusions from it, one of them being potential pregnancy. testing for pregnancy via urine samples can often be inaccurate, doctors are likely to check your blood test results too for an accurate result. don't you think they would have told you that you were pregnant if they checked? definitely id say! or if they thought you knew they would ask you about it.   dont worry about it,but if you're still worried just go to you doctors'/hospital and get a blood test done:) good luck!|`|WkaWSKNAaa	Usually hospitals do the blood test because it is so accurate.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	they most likely did a urine onr. blood tests cost more $$|`|jNqf8HtDaa	when i went they did a blood test so they probably did that and it shows up sooner and clearer|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I'm not sure.

She should still be seeing a doctor regularly and mention this|`|eemmWU0Haa	She should really go see her doctor just to be sure she's ok and to see if the baby's ok as well just to be on the safe side.|`|qLkknQx1aa	yes. the baby is protected pretty well in there. - example.. i was 6 months pregnant and in a major car accident. i was driving, the air bag deployed and everything. all turned out well. - does your friend have a doctor??  wouldn't she still know if she was pregnant or not?  if she's your friend, why don't you ask her?
afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	I found out at 19 weeks that we are having a boy. I don't know how accurate but from the picture I have he is definitely a boy or else our little girl has an odd growth between her legs. Good luck    And just because they may not see a penis doesn't mean its not a boy because a person I knew was told they were having a girl on one ultrasound and they never had another and painted the nursery pink had all girl items, girl name, and it came out a baby boy.|`|0X2mRse2aa	well, it depends on ur insurance but i found out at 19 wks and 4 days ITS A GIRL...LOL|`|X2G8EHBlaa	i was 19 weeks when i got mine and all they said was they "think" its a girl but couldn't be sure i'd reschedule the appointment if you want to know for sure what it is.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I found out at 16 weeks that I was having a girl.  She is now 7 so I guess it was accurate :)|`|E7LSetRHaa	I found out I was having a girl at 17 weeks. It is not 100% but it is pretty clear. Hamburger for girl or hot dog for boy. I hate to sound vulgar but that is what they look for and that is what it looks like. Good luck and God bless.|`|yVAdjc6caa	Yep! At 18 weeks they told me it was a boy, and sure enough they were right!!! I will also be finding out at 18 weeks with this one! Only 3 more weeks to go!!!     Congrats!|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i found out that i was having a girl at 12 weeks. they measured the genatalia tube.tthe further along you are the more accuarte. they told me to go back in a few week  so at 19 weeks i had another ultrasound and it was still a girl. it really depends on the ultrasound tech.  good luck|`|WkaWSKNAaa	It's possible, but it is on the early side for trying to see the gender.  20 weeks is the best time to be scanned to check the baby for abnormalities and to find out the gender.  It's amazing the difference just a couple of weeks more makes.  The baby is formed more and the organs can be seen more clearly.|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	Yes usually around the 4-6 month they can tell especially if its a boy it is totally visible and it is very accurate he will take a picture of the little penis and say its a boy!! but usually girls are also easy to tell i found out it was a boy at about 16 weeks so yeah     GOOD LUCK :)|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Yes you can find out. I know somebody found out at 14 weeks.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	i found out i was ahving a boy at 14 wks.. they will definatly know at 18 wks|`|eya1WDS4aa	i found out at 16 weeks that im having a girl and it better be accurate cause we are going all pink lol.|`|VfpI63Qzaa	i was 18 weeks when i found out i was having a boy :)|`|yCUOXInFaa	My neighbor was told at 19 weeks pregnant she was having a Boy! she got the nursery done in yellow & blue and his name on the door........and gave birth to a Girl!!      sometimes they are wrong :)|`|9R1P2Ivgaa	i found out that i was having a boy my ultrasound was really clear. congrats on your pregnancy!!
23fDrmZoaa	well let me start off by saying this... with my first daugher i took a pregnancy test from dollar tree and it came back negative. 2 days later i went to teh doctors, got sent for a blood test pregnancy test (its really the most accurate) and it came back positive, when they did my ultrasound i was 8 weeks pregnant. DO NOT trust the cheap pregnancy tests. The best thing to do is to call your doctor and get a blood test, but wait until you have a missed period.|`|KgesGnEbaa	Girl i can tell you right now your prolly too young to be doing it. If you think your pregnant go to the health department with your boyfriend its free and get tested, if you can drive. My best friend has been pregnant 3 times and has gotten an abortion each time and now that girl is pregnant again, she was in the bathroom at school this morning trowing up everywhere. And my friend ashley called me last night crying cuz her boyfriend broke up with her and its cuz she has been pregnant for a few months now and he doesn't want the baby. You be responsible from now on okay. I'm not telling you im perfect I'm 17 and I've had plenty of pregnancy scares just please get some protection from now on.|`|yXiyhD9zaa	If ur gonna have unprotected sex.... 6 times. then girl u better be ready for what happens next.|`|hgWfNAhHaa	Wow.  Now I know im not perfect, no one is. I had my first baby at 17...I was nowhere near ready to be making a baby much less taking care of one. I learned some very important lessons, one being the fact that I needed to be in school instead of some boys car, and two, if I was going to do something stupid USE BIRTH CONTROL AND A CONDOM if I think im "mature" enough to spread my legs. Which im guessing your not if your buying your tests at the dollar tree and your friend used the test and got pregnant, my advice to you is to go to planned parenthood or any clinic you can when you have MISSED your period and get tested and for STDS while your at it. There's no reason to be that dumb...no matter how much he says he "loves" you, I bet when you bring up that lil 4 letter word  B-A-B-Y he'll be G-O-N-E...it sucks but its life and it will happen, and I bet you have a good head on your shoulders...use it hon...I didn't use mine, but I learned from my mistake and in a way that lil girl of mine probably saved my life...I got lucky...some peoples lives are destroyed when this happens...some girls are even younger...my best friend was 15 when she had hers.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	my friend took a test but she got pregnant    wow, didn't think that taking a test got you pregnant    Go speak to your mother about this|`|Ltvcp5Iwaa	You might be testing too early.  When was the last time you had unprotected sex?|`|jNqf8HtDaa	well it depends on when you had your last period and if its been 4 weeks sense then the test is probably right i wouldnt take the other just yet though maybe wait another week if it already has been 4 weeks|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Sex makes babies.   Why would you say you had unsafe sex if you are not aware of that?  Help you?  The only help I can offer is to use pills and a condom. Or don't have sex anymore.  Get tested for STDs and pregnancy and be smart in the future.|`|QmPuip7Raa	cheap pregnancy tests usually are inaccurate! get this one:  http://www.firstresponse.com/index.asp?u...  or go to the doctor if you still feel unsure!
a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Yes, you should just admit your wrong doing now because if you're caught, you'll get into big trouble- fail the test, possible detention or in-school suspension, parents called, etc.  Just tell your teacher that you tried it to see if you could get away with it, but in the end your conscience got the best of you, so you're owning up to your own mistakes and hope she/he will forgive you.|`|Inc78M0Raa	I cheated once and told the teacher because I felt bad for doing it.  She even let me keep the same grade on the test and just said for me not to do it again.  Honesty is the best policy.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	If it were me, I would tell. Because if you don't you can also get yourself into a lot of trouble. You need to take responsibility now.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	i think you should tell.  you were irresponsible - owning up would  make you look like you realize what you did  was wrong.    not owning up makes you look dishonest,  and like you thought you were going to get  away with it.    'fess up.|`|7ad5cc0b1e1e9c33fffe4554cf26af75aa	You need to tell your teacher the truth. Chances are at some point it will come out anyways. So it would be pretty embarrassing if the teacher had to confront you about it. Make sure however, that what you did was REALLY something wrong, and not a misunderstanding. . Sine you clearly feel guilty, you will not enjoy a good grade if you receive it, knowing you don't deserve it.  Good luck.|`|RLMcpYheaa	Just go ahead and tell.   Honesty is the best policy.|`|Td5eZ4oMaa	YESS!|`|d5K8wORqaa	i would wait lol:]|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	dont do it again and leave it alone|`|gILygKvRaa	yes. you should. admit to your wrong doing. you will get in less trouble for being honest. Trust me|`|QXSFpMzDaa	First off I am not a teen.  But if you are already talking about this you already know what you need to do.  As a parent I would rather my child come to me and tell me the truth (or if I were a teacher same thing).  You will get into that much more trouble if you lie about it.  Chalk it up to a lesson learned.  And you never know!  Maybe your teacher and you could work something out.  But you need to be honest.  Plus at 80% those aren't good odds.
jaP0TANdaa	I was on Depo for 8 years and had my last shot in March 2008 (so the Depo actually "expired" in June 2008 when I should have had my next shot but didn't). I had what seemed to be a period in the end of June, but looking back I really think it was just a withdrawal bleed. I then went about 45 days without another period and then had a really weird cycle. Finally, my periods returned to a somewhat normal state. So, it took me about six months since my last shot to go back to somewhat normal cycles. I've been TTC since (for a total of 8 cycles now) and haven't had any luck. I have confirmed that I'm ovulating with charting and BBT (as many women who come off of Depo don't start ovulating again right away), but discovered I had a shorter luteal phase of only ten days, which can be a problem. For the past two cycles I've been taking Vitex and the first cycle it helped lengthen my luteal phase by two days. Still waiting to see how it affected me this cycle as AF should be here anytime now. I have heard that the general time frame for conceiving after Depo is about one year from the time your shot expires. I've heard of some who got pregnant right away, and others it has taken years. I've read some research and literature that suggests that Depo could cause problems with low progesterone levels and short luteal phases after coming off, but who knows. Doctor's like to say that Depo does not affect your fertility and you should be able to conceive within a year of trying (like everyone else) after coming off, but I'm not so sure! Good luck to you and hopefully you'll be one of the lucky ones that can get pregnant quickly after coming off of Depo. If I were you, I'd stop taking it now and give your body a while to adjust and get back to normal... there are always condoms, which is what I did for the first few months, enough hormones for me!|`|iMY2fgYdaa	everyone is different of course...but for me I too was on depo for about 4 years. I got off it just before I got married and it took me 3 years to even get a period back and then I only got my period back because my doct put me on the pill to help regulate it. I was on the pill for about a year and then stopped that so I could get pregnant...but that was just me...I suppose if you have always been regular before depo..you should be able to get pregnant within the first year of trying<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I would talk to your gyno. Tell him what you are trying to do and see what advice he has for you. If you are planning on coming off of it then make sure that you use protection in the mean time if you are having sex. I would talk to your partner and find out how long he wants to wait to have children. Some men don't want them for a few years, some want them right away. Talk with your soon to be husband and then with the doctor.
wTYh7DiSaa	Honestly, as a mom who had lost 2 from miscarriages I am overly paranoid and I would STOP. But, seeing that this is not a new routine for you then I would assume that you are fit even through pregnancy to continue. However, women are advised to take it easy, especially with anything that is strenuous. You really should consult your doctor about this and see what he/she thinks. Being fit is great during pregnancy however, I do know that crunchies and those types of  exercise should be avoided completely especially later on with a pregnancy.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	that really is something you should discuss with your doctor because each woman is different and each pregnancy is different. A friend of mine was into intense exercise when she found out and her doctor told her to slow it down and stick with like the bike, jogging and areobics that she felt comfortable with .|`|DBrNaYNyaa	go see your doc, see what he advises   whats best for you and the baby!|`|c51eCv4gaa	You should talk to your doctor about this.  There are some things that apply to all women, like not flying or doing crunches after the second trimester, but a lot of it is personal decision with the help of a doctor.  At your next appointment, voice your concerns and ask if there will come a point when you should stop.  It may just depend on the baby.  Inform your employers that you're expecting, so that when you take maternity leave, it won't come as a shock.  Other than that, I would say go about your normal routine and follow your instincts.  Remember, this is a natural process, and usually, your body will tell you if you're doing something wrong.<br>  Best of luck!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Unless you're considered high risk for some reason, you should be find continuing doing the same level of physical activity (minus the ab workouts or any really heavy lifting perhaps) as you were doing before becoming pregnant. I've known women who have run marathons in their third trimester! Talk to your doc, of course, but you'll probably be fine continuing on as long as it's physically comfortable for you.|`|Ov9qM1gdaa	This would be a question that only you and your doctor should decide. Your doctor because he knows your medical and lifestyle issues and yourself because you would know if you are physically up to it after awhile.
jNqf8HtDaa	yes i have felt that way and the next month i ended up pregnant... i was sure i was too but not so much you will be if you want to though give it some time|`|eemmWU0Haa	Yup...Been there done that like every month...its when I least expect it then it happens...in September and in December..got pregnant those 2 times with my now fiance and I wasn't expecting it and I miscarried both times sh!tty..but that's life!|`|895XRbnJaa	yes i thought i was pregnant about a week after i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend, even though i was on the pill i just knew i was pregnant and ive never been pregnant before. it turned out that i was pregnant.|`|PkbPOWzsaa	it seems to me you weren't trying but you were wishing that happened.I thing when u less expect is going to happen.wish u best of luck!
WbJPQM1naa	If you haven't had one, ask for a tour of your hospital L & D unit.  They can tell you more about where you will give birth and who you may have present with you.  Most hospitals now have labor and delivery in birth "suites" they call it.  But, it's usually just a private room where you labor and have you baby in the same bed.  And most hospitals have usually allowed you as many visitors in with you as you wish.  Immediate family and grandparents are usually welcome.      I would stay open and tell your parents to be flexible.  You never know how you might feel when you are in labor.  You might think now that you don't want your mother or MIL present, but you might just change your mind in when you're in labor.    Usually, if you have a healthy, natural delivery with no complications, you and your baby will stay at least 24 hrs after your birth.  Sometimes it will depend upon the time of day you give birth.  When I had my first, I went in in the middle of the night and she was born about 1:45am after being in labor all the previous day.  I was kind of hyped on the after effects and adrenaline rush and didn't rest at all the day she was born.  They came and wanted to discharge me the morning of the following day.  I asked to stay another night because I was a single mom and felt I needed a bit more rest.  They warned me that my insurance would not pay for it, but they did.  It was good because my baby developed jaundice by the next day and they were not sure to let her go home until that was treated.    So, go with your heart, too.  If you feel ready to go home and you and your baby are healthy, insist that you want to go home.  If you feel you need more time to recover, than ask for it.  YOU are the consumer, after all.  So, be proactive about your care in every aspect of your birth and postpartum care!  It is really sad how many don't and somehow sign away their autonomy when they check into the hospital.  YOU CAN choose to refuse anything you don't want and YOU can choose the way you want to give birth!    So,it really varies with every baby and every individual case.  I would recommend to do everything you can to avoid medical interventions.  If you have an epidural, you are 50% more likely to end up having a c-section.  You are also more likely to have a c-section if you have induced labor.  Statistically, you and your baby are at risk EVERY time you accept any medical interventions during labor.  I'm going to send you a link to a fabulous documentary I just watched called "Pregnant in America"... I recommend EVERYONE see this movie.  It's a real eye opener!    I will keep you in my prayers for a great birth experience and a healthy baby.  Don't fear.. YOU are ABLE to give birth to your baby, just as millions of women, throughout history have done!  Take good care, get plenty of rest now, while you can and drink lots of water!  Much love,  R|`|0437a9a5ca16bc09f111190dcbc55384aa	I guess it depends on the hospital, but usually, its 2 people in the delivery room for a normal non-complicated birth.( C-section would only be dad allowed, or one person.) vaginal birth is a 2 day stay, c section is 4 days. I had a great birth, so they asked me if I wanted to be discharged early and I said no, because I needed and wanted the medical help. You can choose whether or not the baby rooms in with you... I had her in with me the first night, the next, I had her go to the nursery so I could rest. Husband can stay the entire time. Friends and family members will have to wait until you are not in recovery, or until you are in your room to visit you... unless you can get them in, rules are all different for that so I would check... Also, hospitals do tours that you can sign up for that explain all of this stuff, just call up and ask... Your OB may be able to answer some of your questions too...  As far as the in laws and your parents... They have to understand that everyone is anxious for YOUR baby, including you two.(meaning you and your hubby) so they will have to be patient. also tell them that since only two people are allowed, you are not comfortable choosing between them because you love them both, so they will have to meet the baby at the same time. Thats a hard one. My mom wants to come in with me again with this baby, and I feel that I owe my mother in law the opportunity to be there this time, but she doesn't want to be there, and My mom, as much as I love her, I want to have this baby with just me and my husband there. Also, I need her to stay with my two year old because MIL won't do that either... I love her, but she can be a crazy in law sometimes.... Anyways, GOOD LUCK no matter what, and its YOUR baby, and one thing that I had to learn, was that as much as I put other people before myself all the time, this is the first time that you have to stand up for your baby and your new family... Congratulations on your new addition!|`|0g3gVfKYaa	Have the baby at home then you wont have any worries. Whatever you do you have the say and tell them what you want. Mums have all the power if they want it.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I was in there 2 days. They make you stay until you can pee on your own. My husband, mom, aunt, mother in law, 2 dr.s and 4 nurses were in there. My son stayed with me for about an hour then he went to the nursery. They brought him to me every 2 hrs. to nurse. It is okay if you only want your hubby in there. I didn't care who was in there.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	You CAN  go home at any time you want. If you have insurance they will cover 2 days for a vaginal delivery and I think 4 for c-section. You do not have to have people in the room if you don't want them there. Only my husband and the staff were at my delivery. I made it clear to my family that no one was allowed at the hospital for at least 24 hours, because like you said, you will not be in the right frame of mind to entertain guests. However, if you cannot tell your family that you do not want them there, consider the fact that you may be in labor for several hours before you actually deliver. If you don't want to hurt feelings, consider having you family there while you are in labor and then you can ask them to leave when it's time to push. Also consider that you may be in labor in the middle of the night (are they going to be there then?), and you might wake up early in the am to start pushing, so they might not actually be there. I am not sure what the visiting hours are for non partners. Hope that helps!|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	My stay was 2 nights both times. No complications with either. My baby stayed in the room with me at all times, and my husband was able to stay too, although it depends on what is available at your hospital at the time of birth. I think the general rule is they prefer you to stay a night at least to monitor you, especially for 1st time mothers but you can discharge yourself & baby after 6 hours if all is well with you both.    As for the delivery, just tell the staff that you only want your husband and the necessary staff in the delivery room and they will take care of it for you and ensure no-one else intrudes.   Good luck, I wish you a beautiful experience :)|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	If you want to restrict your family and his from the delivery room, it might be best to ask your doctor first if you can use him as your excuse.  Then you can tell them that your doctor doesn't want anyone who doesn't need to be there in there.  If you can blame it on the doctor, you'll be saving yourself a lot of grief in dealing with hurt feelings.  As for how long I stayed in the hospital, I stayed for four days.  I didn't have a C-section though.  My husband just called our insurance company and asked them when they considered it "another day" and they said that the clock on my stay would begin once the baby was born.  Then he checked with the hospital to find out what time their billing department considered it "another day" and he was told 6 p.m.   So, I was actually in the hospital for four days though my insurance only allowed me two because my first day didn't count because I was in labor and the baby wasn't born until nearly 8 p.m. and the day we left the hospital, I checked out at 5:30 p.m.   Make sense?    My baby roomed with me.  There were nine babies born the night I gave birth and none of them stayed with in the nursery.  I had a private room though, so it was no problem.  Good luck!|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I had a c section and was there for 2 days and it is major surgery so only one person was allowed in the room.    I wanted my baby in the room...I was nursing and he did pretty well, but u can send them to the nursery.    My mom stayed the night with me...there was actually a pull down bed.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	It depends on the hospital.  In my area the mother can name only two people who can be in for labour.  And as to visitors after, it is restricted to the father, the grandparents and the siblings of the newborn.  If you delivered vaginally and there were no complications they send you home within 24 hours.  If you have a c-section, 3 days.  The father is not allowed to stay over night once the baby is born.|`|UKHDlvM5aa	If it's a vaginal birth and there aren't any complications, the hospital stay is generally less than 24 hours after delivery (can be up to 48 hours, depending on your insurance). It may or may not involve an overnight stay, depending on what time of day your baby is born (e.g. if you give birth at midnight, they'll probably wait until the next morning to discharge you). If you have an uncomplicated caesarean delivery instead, the average stay is about 3 days. Of course, if there are any complications in either case, your stay may be longer.    Most hospitals will allow you to have whoever you want in the delivery room. If you tell them that you only want your husband and the staff there, then they won't allow the rest of your family in until you say so. But that also means that you can't use "hospital rules" as a convenient excuse to keep your folks and in-laws out of there. You'll just have to be honest with them about your wishes.|`|59M4xUwXaa	2 days stay. And just tell them you only want your husband in the delivery room, they will just have to understand. My mom and my hubby will be with me and I told my Mother In Law that her place is in the waiting room. She doesn't like it but it isn't her cooter on display so I really don't care. :) Also the hospital that I am going to ask that only 2 people be in the delivery room so that works to my advantage. OH and the baby can stay with you or in the nursery. The nurses want you to get some rest too...so if you need a little nap don't feel guilty for asking them to keep the baby for a bit...take advantage of it while you can. Don't be nervous...it's actually a very happy and very tiresome time. Good luck!!|`|vGpawdUCaa	I had to have a C-section and the baby had a little bit of jaundice we stayed 5 days. My husband was allowed to stay overnight the entire time, and could come and go as he wanted. The baby stays with you the entire time, unless you want them to take it to the nursery.   You just tell your nurse who you want in the delivery room and they will take care of that for you.   I also recommend bringing your favorite pillow.
fdnbXfvfaa	Hell yeah I would ask!|`|FiUprYsvaa	Just find the website for sex offenders in your complex.  I doubt the apartment place has a list. look online.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	Nothing is inappropriate when it comes to your kids health.|`|n86P8yccaa	you should ask|`|zXCFGPhOaa	No, i don't see anything wrong with that. Just ask, "If you don't mind,can you please give me a list of all the sex/child offenders in this apartment complex, i would like to know because i have a 2 year old, and want to keep him safe as possible." If they say no, then you need to try and get on a website that shows registered sex offenders in your area. I know you can do that, but i am not sure of the name.|`|nfzQkvqraa	You should be able to go online and access that information on a free state website.  Google Meg ans law and your state name.  I don't think it's inappropriate to ask, but it would be better to do the research yourself.  I did, and there is one in our neighborhood.  I have access of more then just a yes or no. Because I went on the website, I have his picture, his employer, and his crime.  Much more accurate info than you would get just asking.  Although each state varies with their laws.|`|fDXrRtkHaa	Hellz yes! I want my 2 little girlz safe as can be!|`|HZbSbZIraa	i think it is a great idea to ask and find out i know there is website in which you can type in your adress and see all the registerted sex offenfers around your area i know the website for MI but if you just go to yahoo or google and type in sex offender list or something along that line there will be several sites where you can enter your address and see !!!!!|`|nrGsxWw3aa	I would call your local police department and ask.  In my state real estate agents are not allowed to give out that information but they can direct you to a website (if your state has one).  I am in Virginia and I can pull it up whenever I want.|`|wWGNvMIQaa	Yes.......straight up!   "Do you have any registered sex offenders in this complex? If so what apt   do they live in?"  If they do not answer you can look it up online. By law they have to tell where they live. (At least in Texas they do, I don't know about other states)|`|SBj7fhNvaa	I dont think thats inappropriate at all its good parenting.  With the world the way it is you can never be to safe.  And I believe by law you are supposed to be informed.  There are websites out there where you just list your address and they tell you if there are any sex offenders I'm not sure what the site is though sorry.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	I don't really know how to answer that, but it's a good question.  I would look online first for a free sex offender website.  There is one out there I saw on tv recently, but it costs money to join.  As far as I know, they can't withhold that information from you at the Complex.  If they know of any living there, they MUST inform you.  You could also call a lawyers office in your area and check with them to make sure that information is correct.     Actually, I would call the local police station and ask them...they may have the best resources!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Yup. You have every right to know this information!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	yea i would. they have websites that you can go on. you have kids then it is appropriate. there is one living next door to me. and i have 3 girls. he is kewl tho. i would go on the website first, but they should be registered.|`|hPXu5RzTaa	this is a stupid question to ask on a board, af course you should ask|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I'd ask. I think they should have a list.|`|PpvEOjY7aa	How scary! ... YES by all means ask, not inappropriate at all ... have never been in that situation, but would try online?  Hope it works out for you & good luck!|`|AA11742839	You should defiantly ask! if they dont give you one look it up or go to your local law enforcement agency and ask 4 1.|`|qNf0A4V4aa	the complex wouldnt have the list, but you can get it from your local police department|`|tpfxZZADaa	I highly doubt the complex has a list.  You can ask the local police, or the sex offender registry website.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	u should be able to look for the sex offender registry in your city/county.  It will give you any sex offenders within like 5 or so miles of your address.|`|jPlUycx0aa	I most certainly would ask.  I care about the safety of my children.  I would find this very appropriate. Just say, "are there any sex offenders in this complex if don't mind me asking"|`|AA12221392	you don't have to ask they have websites you can go to and it will tell you anyone living within so many miles of you.    I wouldn't ask I would just look it up for myself|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Just look it up online yourself before you move in:    http://www.familywatchdog.us/|`|rAkWoweOaa	ask.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	You can ask but its kind of weird. Just go to fbi website and you can follow the links and type in your address and find out for yourself.   I checked around my neighborhood and there is over 20 people in here ( in about 10 mile radius) it freaked me out. )( and its not a bad neighborhood)
sGP6s7uraa	I love it! I love the spelling.  I've actually considered this name (spelling included) because Lee is a family name ;)|`|eV5E9MhUaa	It's sweet, but Emma is very overused right now. But yes, you could do any number of combinations with lee. Like Rosalee. Also, people would probably just call her Emily, istead of Emmalee it rolls differently, so that might get on your nerves. Congrats! :)|`|dKMpztcJaa	You mean Emily? you can't spell emily a different way. It does not work. You have to go with a name that sounds like emily. What about Emmalynn (emma-lyn), Emmaline (emma-leen) or Amiley (a-miley)<br>  <br>  If you mean emmalee (a-mall-e) the spell it Amalee or Amalia (aw-mall-e-a)|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	It is COUNTRY.  you hear me?  That is the COUNTRIEST name I've ever seen.<br>  <br>  Emily is pretty.  You just jacked it all to hell.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Ummm...no it doesn't.|`|95M9WTqoaa	i think it should just be spelt Emily.<br>  Emmalee looks awkward, i think.|`|hNIof0lbaa	Different spelling.....! I like it! Emmalee Lynn?!|`|XukXVsJvaa	Yeah the spelling is WAY too much but Emily is a rather cute name.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Just spell it Emily.|`|6Nuaqihpaa	Love it!|`|87bc29daecdde4dfaeb273c4b8b48c2faa	love it|`|nfLyS1toaa	i like it|`|34VXCyvVaa	I think most people would pronounce Emmalee just like Emily.  They'll just figure that it's an alternate spelling like Emilee and Emileigh.<br>  <br>  Emmalee Paige<br>  Emmalee Rose<br>  Emmalee Meredith<br>  Emmalee Torrance
OocDN5evaa	Sounds like in order to get her attention, you're going to have to do something drastic. I'm not telling you to run away from home or anything, but it's time to throw you're things down and tell her how you feel.     Tell her that you love her and want her to love you but that you can't handle everything she's throwing at you. You have to explain to her how you can't be yourself when sports are suffocating your life.     "I love you, mom - BUT I CAN'T HANDLE ALL OF THIS!"     And refuse to go to a practice or two of the sports you like less than others. The only way you're going to be listened to is if she really thinks there's a problem - obviously you're good at covering it up (which is understandable), but it's time to tear those walls down and show her the cracks.     Rock on.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	You just need to tell her and no matter what her excuse is don't let it be one. Just say mom I really need to talk you I need a break. If she says she is too busy try and catch her at a time when she isn't doing anything or if its something you can talk to her while she is doing.|`|fHIIhCAXaa	Aww, im really sorry about that. But also congratulations for learning and doing all those activities, and being a good sport about it. When you try to talk to her, dont say "i need to talk", just go up to her and say "mom im tired of all this" and see what she has to say. Tell her that you just want to have a break. Try telling her at a time when she is cooking, or driving or something, that way she cant use those excuses. Be firm about it, but dont be yelling either. It kinda sounds like SHE is living your life. If she gets mad, then tell her you really need some time to yourself and to relax. Or tell her you just want to drop some of the things not all. Good luck, and you have been a great sport.|`|NDju3p0Raa	u r a beast! u do soo much! quit a couple of ur sports that u r the worst at. that will give u more time 2 b with friends and relax|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you know what shes trying to keep you busy to keep you focused but like you are saying this is too much. i would write her a letter and hand it to her and walk away. this way she can read it and focus more. it would be best like you have done here and tell her what you have told me then maybe she'll wake up.|`|0KTVNTYYaa	i have a few answers:    1. yell at her  2. start doing really bad at every practice and Competition  3. be like me (a computer addict)       good luck :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	My god how old are you? Next time tell her hey mom i need to talk to you, when she says not now...tell her NO, it's got to be now! I don't condone getting mouthy with parents, but in your case i would. Tell her until she listens and if she won't listen then just tell her anyways.     There is a deeper reason she is doing all of this, she may be trying to live out her own life through you, or she may be worried about you getting into trouble since your dad isn't around. Just tell her you need to drop some sports or activities, tell her up front that it is too much for you and you are getting exhausted.|`|tvTVbZLGaa	is your mom a housewife? maybe she has nothing else to do|`|mrrVtKGgaa	Just tell her. or tell your dad, that you are doing too much things, and you don't like it .|`|DGXE4VH0aa	Call child services....that's brutal.|`|7pZOVkMoaa	Me: Just don't participate. Solves everything. They kick you off, and shazam: no more sports.  Guy on my right: Nothing.(?)  Guy on my left: hire my dad as a lawyer.|`|s2JvJ5alaa	I used to be busy like that. Not quite as busy as you, though.  You seem severely over-whelmed.  I had to actually write my mother a letter to get her to understand. And that way, you can actually collect all your thoughts and have everything you want to say.|`|d20072835be2d3a9ce08db7d9a05932faa	Parents can be stubborn (trust me, I would know and I think everyone does, haha). Here's an idea:  "Mom, doing all these things really isn't my thing, I'm not really into them, and I don't think I should be forced into doing them. I don't understand why I need to do so much, maybe one or two extra curricular activities would be a lot easier, and A LOT cheaper. Doing so much puts a lot of stress on me, and I'm already getting stress from school and the hours of homework they give me, and all these extra activities limit the time I have to do my homework and focus on school."  My mom is currently trying to force me into doing like ten million things, just because my sister does and she wants me to be more outgoing, and also because she believe it'll "keep me out of trouble."  I wish you the best of luck(:|`|AA11635143	It's obvious that your mother is trying to re-live her childhood through you.  She is making you do the things that she missed and that is just so unfair.  Try once more to talk to her and ask her to please take the time to listen to what you are saying.     Then go talk to your relatives, grandparents, aunts uncles, cousins, and especially your teachers and tell them that you are just exhausted, not getting enough rest at night and worn out from all the sports you are involved in.  Ask them to talk to your mother and make her listen.  Personally, I think your mother is a nut to make you do so much.  Tell your mother you have had enough and absolutely refuse to participate in anymore sports.  If she insists, go to practice and sit on the sidelines.  I really feel sorry for you because your mother has turned your life into a traveling circus.|`|D7Hxp0zDaa	Refuse to go to a competition or pagent or a game.  If you dont wanna be in one of these.  Mess up alot, theyll kick you out.  Then you CANT go.  You do need a break.  Youre only a kid.  Good luck :/|`|elStzvvhaa	my parents were the same way. so one day i took them into a room sat down with them and told them iwas under way to much pressure. trust me they wont hate you for the rest of your life if you dont say anything nothing will ever change|`|aOy7yW3yaa	Ugh, same with my mom, but what I did was when she said to like practice or w/e i stood up to my mom and was like HEY, I HATE THESE GOD DAMN ACTIVITIES YOU KEEP SIGNING ME UP FOR! She said okay after a while and she started taking away some activities. Although she isnt taking away all the subjects I dont like, she is doing it one by one.|`|7rJLkaAaaa	wow. I think you and my little sister should have a need a break conference.... my dad and step mom are the same way with my little sister they want her to be an over Achiever at everything. The poor kid needs to be on every team possible ... involved in travel teams, town teams, school teams, olympic teams in both basketball, soccer and softball ... then she's a a cheerleader and a dancers. She's on about 4 teams per sport and has to maintain straight a's she is the talented and gifted program in schools and has double the homework just to stay in there classes. You need to make her listen to you. Maybe try writing a letter so you dint get interrupted. some how you need to make her listen to you ... I honestly feel that parents try to live through the spot lite of there childs life and i think that you need to tell her to get involved in other things other then torturing you with all these ridiculous activities ... i mean you cant be forced into things that you dont want ... i wish you the best of luck|`|hBMn6U4Xaa	scream and tell her
qX8EFFVtaa	No.  The only time a mother's antibodies can affect her unborn child is if the mother is Rh negative (A-, O-, etc)  Even then it is usually not a problem for the first child anyway.  They do an blood test early in pregnancy, and if the mother is Rh neg, she will get a shot prior to birth so she will not develop Rh antibodies which could harm future births. You being Rh positive, this won't be an issue for you. I am very sorry about your mc.  Most mc occur for unknown reasons that are almost always beyond anyone's control.  Do not blame yourself.  Your chance of this happening again is no greater than anyone else.  Keep your head up.  Good luck to you.|`|9243ea0535f139ef664eccb335fe7179aa	don't worry god will send u a healthy baby soon just don't give up and pray a lot|`|vZuzT3cTaa	first of all im really sorry to hear about your loss. but no it doesnt matter what blood type you are. sometimes miscarriages happen for a reason thats beyond us. i dont think you will have problems again if your trying to get pregnant. just eat lots of vegies and fruit, and prenatal vitamins everyday, will help keep the baby strong!|`|MH9w47FCaa	I completely agree with Valentin... you have no blood compatibility issue since you, the woman is rh +    Miscarriage happens relatively often... sometimes it does not implant, sometimes it hangs on a little bit longer... enough to get a positive pregancy test and then you loose it...     Had your mother miscarriages? if so check for fibroma...    Try again, and if it happens again, it might be a simple hormone problem...

miPubuDYaa	Don't quit your job.<br>  <br>  If you do look for a new job just remember that most companies will not cover materny leave for 1 year. I would stay with your current job. Let them know you are preggers around week 10.<br>  <br>  They mostly will not fire you because its against the law to fire a pregnant women because she can proform her duties due to pregnancy. Most companies are afraid to fire any pregnant women even for a lay off due to bad economy<br>  <br>  I feel this is the only reason why i'm still employed at my position. My boss has told me twice "do you appreciate that you still work here because i don't need secretary anymore?"<br>  <br>  Honestly i wish they lay me off because i hate the way i have been treated the past few months|`|pHAKN32yaa	When I was 5 months pregnant, I tried looking for a job all over town and I had NO luck. Not b/c no one was hiring but b/c they knew I would leave in a few months. I didn't consider it discrimination at all, (I'm not about to go and blame that on someone.)<br>  Generally, with layoffs, they get rid of the most expensive employees. So, the ones who make the most will usually be the first to go. If I were u, i wouldn't say anything about u being pregnant just yet. Talk to some of the ppl around where u work and see if the layoff s will stop any time soon. Once things calm down.  That way u know when would be a good time to spread the good news.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can look for another job. What you're suppose to do is wait until they offer you the job and then just tell them that you would love the job but you do have to let them know that you're pregnant. That way they can't discriminate against you. It's up to you though. That is a tough situation. Hope it goes well. Good luck and Congrats!|`|DBrNaYNyaa	my friend was a few weeks prenant and quit her cashier job (stupid idiot) <br>  she didnt want to work but wanted money.

They treated her like any other staff and gave her maternity.|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	you need to go talk to your boss, and see what your chances of being layed off are. and frankly be honest with them. tell them that you are expecting and that you need to know if you need to start planning a different career or if you will get a notice before you are actually layed off! talk to them! im positive that they would rather you be honest than hide it!|`|hNIof0lbaa	I wouldnt go & tell anyone at work...its really not their business, ya know? Especially if they are laying off. However, your only 5 weeks, Go ahead and look for a new job!! You can hide your belly for awhile...then when the times right, tell them!! Im sure your new job will understand & prob give maternity leave! Just dont tell them at your interview or anything like that!!
AA10976951	All my labor pain was in my back and down my right leg.  We went through many bottles of lotion for massages.  If you have someone that can massage your hips try that, it did help.

d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	Since this is for a "research" project Ill give you some extra info..    There are more reasons for this attitude than you have listed.     1. male to female contact as men can not control their reactions to a certain part of their body... (true but false at the same time)    2. Pedophile (you HEAR more about men than women, there are more men than women but there are women who do it too) Note this is different than answer 1... email me and Ill give you full details.     3. perceived parentage roles.     It is number three that I will give you details on now.     I am male. My daughter is Female... so far so good .. lol    My wife, mother in law, daughter, and myself were walking around a new Wal Mart that opened. My mother in law was visiting and wanted to get a bunch of stuff for our first child. My daughter bonded with me due to my wife having emergency surgery and being hospitalized for a while so she wanted to be held by me. I was walking around the store with her in a high cradle position, cradled in my arms but high up so as her head was resting against my cheek. I felt that her diaper was wet so asked an employee (female, older woman (older than my grandmother)) where the restrooms were and if they had a family restroom so I could change my daughter. I had a changing kit hanging from my belt so I was prepared. She told me... You cant change your daughter, get your wife or girlfriend to do it. Then she changed her mind.. dont get your hopes up she was not that smart.. and she said... here Ill change her for you and she put her hands on my child and tried to take her out of my arms.   Several customers saw this and before I could blink the lady was gone.. being pulled away by a group of ladies while another group of ladies stood in front of and beside me. The ladies beside me put their arms around me and led me to where the restrooms were so I could change my daughter. One of the ladies.. not sure if it was one who showed me the restrooms or another had gotten a manager over to talk to me.  He was FULL of apologies and kept going on and on about everything making excuses for the lady.. You know how old ladies are... you know this you know that.... .I told him that I held HIM accountable for not training her in the proper fasion for the store. By the time it was done we bought 1000 dollars worth of stuff... all for free as several of the ladies started giving me their names and numbers and suggesting that I sue wal mart.     My wife could not understand why I had several women following me around with one of the store managers and why I was pointing out things and the manager was calling crew members to take it to the front. She asked one of the ladies what was going on and when she found out she went ballistic. She demanded to know where the person was who put their hands on our daughter.. when she found out the lady was so old she calmed down.... becuase older people dont know better... or were raised in a time when the men did not do such things.. not even with their sons.|`|cmdAsz2iaa	Well I don't think a little girl should be in diapers at the age of 3. But anyways.... who said it was okay for a mom to take a shower with a kid? I find that really wrong. I could maybe possibly understand when they are really young up to the age of 1.. but i don't think it's necessary after that.|`|CcXIbqnOaa	um, no?! I don't think it's okay for either parent to be naked while a child is. I don't see a problem with giving the children a bath, but there is no need for children to be in the shower with a nude grown adult. Ever. Not in today's world anyway.|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	My two year old is a bit too curious to shower with her father. But he helps her go to the bathroom.|`|bufQfEqbaa	I think 2-3 year olds might be curious of the opposite sex "parts".  They may ask questions and then may tell teachers what they saw, and in todays world, imagine how that would sound to a teacher or family member, etc. I don't think it's safe either way.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I don't say no but I think it's because the mother is the one who breastfed them and had them growing inside of her|`|ooaT4uGraa	I don't think that it's an issue that the child is exposed so much as the father is. I also don't know very many people who shower their young children, most of them put them in the bath.   However, it all depends on how open you want to be with your children. I think it's inappropriate, but then again I never bathed with my son. Ever. But if parents agree that that's how they want to raise their children, and there is no abuse of any kind going on, who am I to judge?   And yes, I think that men are more targeted than women in situations like this simply because they are men, and pedophiles are automatically thought of as men, even though there are some very disturbed women out there too.|`|AA11374644	I don't think its bad but you need to decide when you are gonna stop it... i remember both bathing with my mom sometimes and my dad othertimes when i was young. i would stop at 4 or 5 at the latest tho|`|BUCwZYnzaa	im sry but at 2 or 3 they should be potty trained. and it works both ways. i think it is okay until they are 3. that is when they start to ask questions.|`|59M4xUwXaa	No, I don't think it is wrong. But I do think that when a child starts to notice that they are different from the parent that is showering with them, it's time to stop. I have a little boy whom would actually strip all of his clothes off and climb into the shower with me when he was 2 and 3 years old. I didn't care. But the day that he asked me, "Mommy, did the Monsters bite your pee pee off?"...is the day that I explained to him that he needed to give mommy privacy when in the shower. :) He is five now and walked in on me while I was drying off after a shower the other day and I didn't make a big deal out of it because I don't want him to think that being naked or a naked body is a bad thing. I just asked him to knock before he enters my bathroom and reinforced the whole privacy thing. But honestly, if I had a daughter, I know my husband would not shower with her...he would just think that it's weird. But, as parents, it's our responsibility to teach our children right and wrong. And what is natural and what is potentially harmful.|`|aMpMFLo3aa	I am sorry but that does not look good at all a man taking a shower with a man .. I have a son I never took a shower with him either .. my opinion but I used to take a shower with my daughter until she was 2|`|gq6omW7taa	I don't think it is okay for either parent to shower with a child.  I know I showered once in a great while with my mom when I was like 4 or 5 but that was my mom.  I don't think that a child should be showering though with an adult at the age of two or three.  That is what a bath is used for.  They need to be in a tub supervised.  Right now my daughter is 6mths and sometimes I shower with her or even her dad does but she is very little and we won't be continuing that very much longer.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Of course it's okay    Bloody hell some of these answers are unbelievable, how many of these kids are going to grow up to be ashamed of their bodies?     As long as the father OR mother isn't a paedophile then there is no problem, kids need to know that boys and girls are different........    My daughters are 6 and 8, they both used to jump in the bath with their dad, but I'd say it stopped at around 5 or just before, this was mainly because they'd laugh at their dad and HE was the one who was embarrassed, however if he's getting changed or in the shower and they see him it's not an issue!    Both my girls are extremely independent and shower/bathe themselves, now they're the ones covering themselves up, even from me! lol|`|lYx5qn6uaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with it up until the child becomes curiouse. Sometimes, when you're a stay at home parent, that's the only way to get a shower in. Would you rather risk your child (who won't remember) catching a glimpse of you nude or leave them unsupervised leaving them vulnerable to choking, falling or getting electrocuted? Hmm.. which is worse?|`|rAkWoweOaa	Neither. At that age they should be supervised in the tub by CLOTHED parents.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	i think it's wrong unless he's wearing boxers they shouldn't be naked. i mean they shouldn't at all if you ask me and i bathe with my baby but she's 6months and i wear underwear and when she's older and understands more it will be the same thing i won't show her my privates and her dad will definetely not shower with her! that's nasty. and if i had a son same thing applies. so to parents who do do that just COVER UP!|`|o2c01JsUaa	Males have to be very careful I pick up my 6 year old daughter at school I have got to know some of her little girl friends a few run up and hug me One wants to walk with us and hold my hand I've noted that many of the mothers watch me with cold eyes Last week she held me around my legs I told her not to do that It made feel bad the look in her eyes But in today's environment you just have to protect yourself  But at home our daughter likes too sleep in '' the big bed'' i put her in her own bed when she is fast asleep and know I'll miss it when she goes to her own bed    Sorry down there but Dr Kinsey was sick|`|AA11586960	My pick for 10 points Texas tiger     My job for 38 Years in Air force was weapons IED EOD and i would always start teaching with  " Don't Assume Check "    Yes of course it is don't listen to the Pedofobics for thousands of years we have done this go to any Nudist camp with a family are all the all pedos ???    No of course not I was a family of 9 with 4 girls and 3 boys and remember when we were young all of being bathed on Saturday by our dad to give Mum a break and as i got older would carry my siblings to their rooms so they could dress and when we went to the ponds and lakes the little Girls could not buy bikini tops so they went without and today 4 year olds can buy PADDED tops  WHY ?????      all over the world it is done and Yes men are the targets and most 99% are just good fathers Uncles and friends who love their children and will do the best for them     even the NAZIS treated all the Hitler Youth Male and Female with care and most of them never saw their parents again    and they all were ordered to do short arm inspection parade nude in the snow to toughen them up       a little story USA 2005 5 people beat up a father and put him him hospital for 3 weeks because his 6 year old daughter did not want to go home and ran off shouting leave me alone i don't want to go with you !! !!!    3 men and 2 women beat and kicked and stomped the poor guy to a pulp and only stopped when the little girl screamed what are you doing to my Daddy please stop 3 men convicted and they never caught the women (Cowards)    you see these people took out their GUILT on an Innocent father they believed  Why ????? they must have already been thinking of paedophiles before the incident to react so violently     who by the way he never takes any of his children out any where and still carries the scars     all this because some Bigoted pedophobic took the law into their own stupid hands     People you do realise that less than 1% of the US population have ever been convicted as paedophiles ever asked WHY    would it be because their not as many as you think or god forbid they Might be INNOCENT    Yes we must be Vigilant all children must be protected from harm Including the parent that smokes in the car with their children in tow but do they get beat up or verbally abused ??? No Not Yet   because it is Pedophobic time     look at the Mcarthy era REDS under the beds How many lives ruined for Nothing another Phobia and point the finger there is a Jew and they say we wiped out the NAZIS ??????|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It's not that the child is exposed....more that the Father is exposed.So diaper changing, I don't see any problem with.  And it's up to every individual of course.  And as a Mom, I wouldn't take a shower or bath with my son once he was over 2....just my personal opinion on the subject.|`|KvguovfWaa	I think that around 2 sometimes closer to 3 that children get curious and start noticing that your parts don't look like mine and they might want to touch not knowing it's not okay, use this opportunity to explain that those are private places and  At that point the joint showers should stop whether it's mom showering with son or dad with daughter.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I dont think there is anything wrong with it. But if the girl starts asking about daddy's no no parts then I would think it would be time to stop. My husband will not change in front of our daughter. I will because I mean we have the same parts. But mine are more enhanced. Ya I dont believe that men shouldnt shower with their daughters. I mean mothers shower with their sons. If the father is a good dad and not a freak then I dont see anything wrong with it. I would let my husband take my daughter in the shower because I know how my husband is.|`|FW0iLLKXaa	This is what's wrong with America.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I think 2 is pushing it for girls to be in the shower with their dads. I wouldn't judge someone for this act alone as "unfit" but if I had a daughter I wouldn't have that going on in my house with her father taking showers with her at that age.     And no dads shouldn't stop helping change diapers/underwear on 2-3 year olds because they would be doing that as a necessity, caring for their child. An adult caregiver should be mature enough to be able to see their children naked without it being any issue, however children shouldn't be expected to be mature.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	There is no reason to shower with a two year old unless you dont have a bathtub as two is too young to shower alone.   However, if this need be, same sex should shower together: daughters with mom and boys with dad... two is fairly young but after 3, for sure stick to the same sex rules.   Kids have flash backs of nude parents... and you dont want your daughter flashing back and remembering her fathers genitals... as well as sons and mothers.    If your a Dr. Kinsey fan, than you think its okay to do whatever with a child... if you really want to hear controversial info on this topic, look him up.    As a mother of two daughter and a woman who remembers some flash backs of dad walking from the bathroom nude when I was quite young (and it bothered me for years), I stand by my advice.    And I agree with you, its not bad for a two year old not to be potty trained, I didnt rush either of my daughters, one was two the other three... and neither ever had any accidents  after they were trained and I believe it was because I let them go at their own pace.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I don't think its the sex offender, more the fact that little hands are curious. My ex has no problem bathing his daughter, or helping her in and out of the shower, but I do not think he himself would be comfortable showering with her.
E7LSetRHaa	I had a midwife and an OB-Gyn. I wanted to have natural births with option of epidural if needed. It ended with a c section after 36 hours of labor and yes I got the epidural. My Dr. has a midwife in his practice and I saw both of them through out my pregnancy and I am glad for it. My midwife helped me stay calm but my Dr. is great also so when things didn't work out and me and my baby was in trouble he was right there to step in and take control of the situation. It don't hurt to think ahead. Some people like home deliveries and that is their choose but we would have died had I chose that. Good luck and God bless.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I had both midwife & ob/gyn.  Natural birth!  My midwife was a great help during labor.  Hospital birth.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	First was an ob-gyn -I wanted a natural birth but my bp was high so I got demarol. My labor was 4 hours and I didn't like that I was the last person to get to see my baby in the room, my hubby didn't get to cut the cord, and my doctor didn't even come up to the hospital when I was in labor. What good was he? I could've went to the clinic for all that.   I have a midwife this time. I've been to her classes and she will be there from labor to delivery. I've gotten to know her, and she's educated me on a lot of things so I feel respected. I plan on trying for a waterbirth but we'll see how it goes. If I have to go to the hospital she will go with me, but I'm going to be delivering at a very up-to-date birthing center so they are well equipped and she has 20 years experience so I am confident in her delivering my baby.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I had a midwife with my first and second (still pregnant) and I pretty much had a natural child birth.  I did have some pain medication through my IV, but all it did was make me sleepy and feel like crap after wards.  I still felt every pain and felt like a sleepy crap head at the same time lol.   I was induced and my birth experience wasn't horrible.. I actually labored on my own for the most part and was in labor for about 10 hours which is good for a first time mom.  I might be getting induced with this one too, but I won't know until friday so hopefully I'll go into labor on my own this time.|`|fHgbL046aa	My pregnancy was with an Ob-Gyn, but instead of my Ob I got stuck with a student doctor who was very eager to use me as a guinea pig.   I wanted to go natural but I had an epidural,demerol shots, induced and my water broken. I honestly believe I would have had a c-section if I didn't get the epidural.   I was not dilating until I got the epidural. I then pushed for 2 and a half hours and out she came. In total it was 17 and a half hours and I felt like someone ran me over with a dump truck.   I hated my experience at the hospital and because of that my daughter will be 16 years old when I have my second child. With this pregnancy I'm going with a midwife and a different hospital.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Pregnancy with my son. OB, medicated (not epidural though), induced vaginal. I hated it.  Daughter. Midwife, induced, no pain meds, vaginal. Loved every minute of it!|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	The first 2 times I had an OB & hospital births, epidural. This time I have a midwife & will be having a homebirth, natural. If I ever had another I'd definitely do the MW again, hands down!! I won't be havinga  water birth though as we don't have room for the pool.|`|irGE84Qdaa	my water broke then i went to the hospital,i had DR and had vaginal delivery and yes i took the epidural.|`|usb9nzJjaa	I had a mid wife i used epidual and still had pain so they went back in and gave me a partial spinal. Birth was ok just a little tear my daughter was only 5 pounds so I take that as being blessed.|`|9R1P2Ivgaa	i chose to have a ob-gyn just because it felt like the right choice for me personally because of my family's medical history. i herd that midwifes tend to be more personal.|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	I trust doctors a little more then a midwife and im getting an epidural and well if you end up having a c section you will have to get a epidural any ways. Water births are pretty painful from what I hear    Good luck :)|`|o9u4H6m6aa	Those are great questions. The trouble is no one can tell you what your preferences are, what's important to you, or what your experiences will be.  You have to figure that out yourself.    Having said that, there are lots of resources.     Books:  The Birth That's Right For You by Amen Ness and Lisa Marie-Goulding    Gentle Birth Choices by Barbara Harper    Internet:   The Business of Being Born  ttp://www.thebusinessofbeingborn.com/    http://www.pushedbirth.com/    You tube has a lot of different birth types.  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=8FxB_jmr0x...    just a few to get you started thinking.|`|s9ztFjKIaa	A midwife (IMO) is the optimal choice as they are there through out your ENTIRE labor and delivery whereas an OB is only there to deliver your baby - PLUS, if you want medical intervention (epidural or pain meds) the midwife is right there to order them for you whereas an OB has to be contacted (they normally don't want to be in the middle of the night) and then it has to be ordered.  Plus, sometimes the nurses have difficultly get a hold of an OB for them to order the medication and therefore you have to wait until they call back before anything can be ordered!!!  Also - if you have your partner there, the midwife can assist/teach him/her about different ways to assist in your labor and delivery.  Now, if you DO have any problems or the midwife doesn't feel comfortable delivering your baby - OR if you have to have a  c-section - they will transfer your care to an OB WHILE still being with you for your labor and delivery - so.... sounds like the best of both worlds to me should you decide to go with a midwife.  Sounds like you can have your cake and eat it too!    For this birth I intend on laboring in water in the hospital but delivering outside of the water - which means that I want to labor until I can receive an epidural and then be relatively pain free for the rest of my labor and delivery.    Either way - research for yourself, not everyone feels comfortable with a midwife.|`|byPYbNFjaa	I had OB GYN the birth was natural no pain meds.  No water birth and the experience was not nearly as bad as I expected.  You get so syked up when you see things on tv or hear about it, so I guess it just wasnt what I expected.  Which is a good thing because the pain I had was nothing compared to what I had seen on tv and heard.  Hope this helps.
K7H1zrCbaa	i've never had an abortion.    my mom had an abortion when she was young.  she did it because her husband didnt want children.  she divorced him and met my dad and then had me, my brother, and my sister.  so it all worked out.    my sister had an abortion a few years ago.  she got pregnant, wasnt married, and was addicted to drugs.  she had no job and was just a mess.  she ended it up getting pregnant again 2 years later with the same man.  she kept that one.    A freind of mine had an abortion in highschool.  Obviously she was too young to be a parent (17), and the boy was worthless.  She is now married and has a lovley daughter.  so it all worked out for her too.    Another friend of mine had an abortion a few years back.  she just didnt feel she was ready to be a mother.  She is now engaged and has a baqby girl.    A long time ago, before abortion was legal,  my great grandmother had an abortion.  She already at five children and couldnt afford another one.  so she decided to have an abortion.  The abortion ended up killing her.  So my grandpa and his borthers and sisters were left with no mother.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I am for pro-choice but for my OWN self I would not have one. I don't hate woman for getting one and I leave it at that. I DO however look down on women whom just keep getting knocked up and having abortions and still wont get on birth control. BUT like I said I think there is reasons and circumstances and it is up to you.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I had an abortion because the baby had spina bifida. It didn't have any chance, it was so bad you could clearly see it on my first ultrasound and my doctor advised me that the baby would not last much longer and gave me the option to abort and I did because I didn't like the idea of having to deliver a dead baby later on. I was heartbroken though because I wanted my baby, but I think it was fortunate to know the baby had spina bifida and not just miscarry because I took vitamins everyday from then on out and my other babies have not had it. I only had that 1 abortion and it was for medical reasons I guess you would say but I do have my regrets. I feel like it is my sin to live with.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Abortion is wrong it is killing the life of an innocent human being who knows that baby could find a cure for cancer,disease or anything else. The babies do go through pain, i heard a lady say 75 % of people who get abortions split up in 90 days or less. She also said they have to hold the baby still in cut it. How wrong it is to kill a baby. If you don't want a baby then don't have SEX or suck it up or put the baby up for adoption|`|kbIkVS0raa	I had one a long time ago because I didn't want to be with the father of the baby. I knew that I couldn't support my 5 year old daughter and another baby alone and I didn't think my daughter deserved that. I would never have another one because it made me feel so awful. I am now married and having a baby in April but I still sometimes think about the abortion and get down on myself.|`|3gMWD7Gmaa	godgobbers are live abortions,.,.,REPORT THAT !|`|TdCj89Lraa	I only did it one time and swore to myself it would never happen again.  It was such a shameful experience for myself.      My circumstance for the one I had was that I did not know the guy I was with was going to be the one I would marry and also I felt the guy I was with would be jealous of the baby and use it against me.  Also I couldnt afford a child.  There was a lot that went into that descion.  I felt I wasent ready at all.  I only had been dating the guy for a month we went on to date a year and I left him while he was at work one day because he was phyco.      Everyone had their choice wether to get one or not.  I dont think Olivia (above) is correct in her statements.  When i had mine I was so early it wasent anything but what they said was "jelly"  .  The bible says a baby doesnt have a soul until it takes its first breath.     I am not one to say abortion is right.  But it is the right of the one who has to make the decsion.  I know I will never ever do it again.    However I have a friend who just recently had one and still cries to this day about it.  She could have had it.  Her man just threatened her so much she got scared and aborted it.      I got pregnant again.  Im 36 weeks my man wanted me to have one but I said absolutley not.  We had already done the morning after pill 3 times.  And now we are happily coping with our new arrival to be.      I would suggest to you that abortion is in no way a form of birth control.  If you can not take the pill own up to your responsibilities and get the patch the shot or use condoms for christ sake.  And it is not just your responsibility but also that of the guy your tangoing with.       I know this girl that had  it done at like 3 months pregnant.  It was a two day process and cost lots of money.  They had to cut her uterus then the next day take the fetus...THE FETUS...what a nightmare...You have to live with your descions do whats in your heart and dont let anyone...anyone make it for you.  Its your body, take the best care of it that you know how.  Good luck

AA10196172	No.<br>  <br>  This sound like anti-abortion group misinformation propaganda.<br>  <br>  In Communist Russian, for example, it was hard to get birth control or condoms, so abortion became the most reliable method. The average active Russian woman would have between 7 and 20 abortions in a lifetime. Presumably, the first 5 did not prevent further conception.<br>  <br>  The danger is that if the operation causes an infection that gets near the fallopian tubes, they could be scarred and the egg could not descend. This also raises the risk of ectopic pregnancy. STD's can also cause this sort of scars.<br>  <br>  A proper, clean operation, as done by a good doctor in a well-run clinic, should not cause any infections. Most young women who have abortions go on to have a healthy family, when they are ready.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	There could be two different answers here, depending on what you mean. The point of an abortion is to end a pregnancy.  If you are talking about can abortions keep you from getting pregnant later one. It is a possibility.  There are also proven cases that women who have had abortions can have more miscarriages as well.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Your question is worded strangely. The whole point of abortion is that it terminates a pregnancy that already exists. Preventing pregnancy is something you do by using birth control or by not having sex.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about if later on, if an abortion can cause complications which prevent you from becoming again, the answer is generally no, unless the abortion was botched and there was scar tissue built up in the uterus.|`|OrzXoAywaa	No, actually you can get pregnant as soon as you have unproctected sex right after an abortion....they only way to prevent pregnacy is YOU..you need and should know what to do..if not ASK your doctor.|`|tlu9wlNAaa	do you mean in the future?? it can do if your uterus is damaged during the abortion, but nowadays its highly unlikely x|`|XRLbqtUbaa	It hasn't stopped anyone I know.

E7LSetRHaa	It is not that unusual for a baby to be jaundice and 8 is not that bad at all. My daughters was a LOT higher than that.If I remember correctly we come home when hers came down to 15 or 17. We had to have a billy blanket for a week though. That is a machine about the size of a large shoe box. It has a hose like a vacuum hose that comes out and on the end it has a pad of fiber optic strands. You place it under the babies shirt against the skin on the belly or back. It has to stay on all the time and it breaks down the bilirubin. Don't worry though. This is not uncommon and your baby will be OK. Let the sun shine on her if you can. The sun breaks it down better that anything so sit by a window. Good luck and God bless. And Congrats on the new baby.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	jaundice is common- my son had it and his level were much higher- he came home with me. i nursed him a bunch and gave him sunlight which helps|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Alot of children have jaundice both of my boys came home with me it just has to get a little less and she can go home.

They will cover her eyes and give her treatment under special lights. She will be fine. Both of mine had jaundice and were fine.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Don't worry too much. It's normal to be scared, especially if your baby is stuck under the photo therapy lights. Both my kids were jaundice, but daughter's case was more severe than my son's. She had to stay under the photo therapy lights 24/7 expect for feedings her second day of life. I put her under the lights, but I couldn't resist cuddling with my new baby. So when there were no nurses around I would sneak her into the hospital bed with me to cuddle. I truly think my cuddling made her better! Her second day of life she was over a pound under her birth weight-And when we left the hospital on day 4 she was 3 ounces ABOVE birth weight!|`|xMNpzFzGaa	I'm Filipino and both my sons were jaundiced too. Their levels were at 8 too. Don't stress yourself out (you need some rest too) Just do what you can by getting him some morning sun and breastfeed (if you choose to). As long as it doesn't go any higher than that (like close to 13), your newborn will be fine. Congrats :)|`|VexXqbV9aa	my son had jaundice also. I breast fed him more often and moved his crib next to the window. i would raise the blinds and let the sunlight face him as much as possible. i would also take him for walks early in the morning when the sun is not as strong.     everything is going to be ok. as mothers we worry about our children but we have to have faith that everything will be fine.
afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	Actually  yes I felt that way. I am due three days after you are so I've been going through the same highs and lows that you have been. All of my close girlfriends live out of town and most are younger than me by a couple of years. I know it was hard because I have been married for almost 4 years (I'm 23) and all my friends were single and out partying. Now they have all become engaged and some have been married in the last year and it was hard not being able to go out drinking with them for bachelorette parties since I was pregnant and trying to fit into my MOH dress at my cousins wedding. I feel like no one understands though they are all excited for me they are busy planning their weddings and worrying about school and such. I know how you feel on wishing you had someone besides moms. Its just not the same....I mean its kind of weird for me because my mom and I were never really open about sex and things like that and then to discuss pregnancy stuff and talk about when I was born is kind of odd. I know that there were things like traveling I wish we would have done (I finished as much school as I wanted) but now my hubby and I are planning the big travels for after our kids are out of the house and we retire or saving up enough for cross country trips when the kids are old enough to enjoy the trips too. Dont worry to much you will find someone to talk to. You can email me if you want I dont mind hearing people vent. :) Good luck|`|db5eb3e3611db9f33b37aabd95f1045eaa	Sometimes I feel this way and other times I don't. Only one of my really close friends has children and she lives 150 miles away. I am 22 and a full time college student who has 2 years left and my University before I move down state and head to Law School. I'm terrified for many reasons. I want to be with my baby as much as possible but am determined to finish school and pursue my career dreams as well.     All the people I know who are pregnant are friends of friends. I am relatively close to many of them but its definitely not the same as close friends. Also, no one knows I am pregnant yet but my husband and my MIL as I am only 8 weeks and having a lot of problems, that may be a big factor in my feelings of isolation.     I'm scared to death and amazingly excited at the same time. I am trying to just take one day at a time, but man is it hard.|`|1KppBoKnaa	a great website to check  out is http://www.whattoexpect.com  go to the message boards and choose your due date month. It will help to talk to other mommies due the same time.    What you are feeling is normal.
lzcglDnMaa	Just take a prenatal vitamin in it. This has everything you need to prepare your body for pregnancy. My prenatal vitamin I believe has the 800 mcg in it. <br>  You can get prenatal anywhere. I buy mine from Walmart, they run about $4.00. I buy the One Source Prenatal.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	I use the multivitamins they give away at the WIC office, because they are Free!!!  It has everything that you need in it just like a prenatal vitamin except Iron (which I don't need because I am on well water and get plenty of Iron from it).  It contains 400 mcg of folic acid.  When you are trying to get pregnant 400 mcg is really all you need, then, when you are pregnant you need 600mcg.  Don't forget though, that you also get folic acid in foods that you eat, like some cereals, spinach and other foods.  Your body expels the vitamins your body doesn't use, so 800 mcg won't hurt anything.  Good Luck, and Lots of Baby Dust!!!|`|4WNeBRjVaa	You can take 400 or 800 it's up to you. But you shouldn't exceed 1000. It's not good for you. But I think it's great that your taking it! What a healthy start for you and baby. If your worried your not getting enough. There are plenty of foods enriched with folic acid just type into google. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|6lKbDEFDaa	I agree...just take a prenatal vitamin. I just checked my container  and it says 800 mcg of Folic acid...and i am not pregnant (...that i know of anyway)  :)  if anything, call your drs office and ask, it cant hurt anything  :D|`|a52e7e2bf9b5e0c0877c2b9f9d1b4145aa	800 mcg. I get mine from costco: nature made prenatal vitamins 300 pills, one pill a day, and they are about 13 dollars.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	4oo
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	In this scenario, the offspring would be genetic siblings and would look as similar or different as any other siblings-some look very similar and some look completely different.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	lol.  No....not unless they were twins as well.  Each egg and sperm carry different levels of different things...so there are millions of possibilities of what the children would turn out like.|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	They might share common features but the won't be the same. While they may be identical the genes from both sides won't necessarily line up the same way. That's the reason that siblings look different. Based on what you are asking all siblings would look the same then too.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	The children wouldn't be identical, but they would probably look similar. One might look more like it's mom, the other more like it's dad, for example, but I bet they could pass as siblings, not cousins.|`|9243ea0535f139ef664eccb335fe7179aa	yes of course|`|V9XozM7Paa	I have actually seen an article on this and there was one family I think maybe it was in England that twin brothers and twin sisters married and their children were not exactly identical but looked very very very alike. It was amazing seeing the pictures. They would probably look more alike if they were all about the same age too|`|3t8inByWaa	sorry, this isnt an answer, but I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED THE EXACT SAME THING!!!!!!!!!!! like seriously!!!

Good nite:P|`|eya1WDS4aa	Why are you ranting? its the pregnancy section if you dont like it then go to a new section. No one is forcing you too look!!    Well just dont open the questions. Some are women how have been ttc for months to years now and they just want our support and to know what we think. Its Y!A.|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	I agree with you but alot of these girls are to scared to go buy one or know anything about it so thats why they ask and alot of the times they wanna know if their symptoms sound like they are so that they can go buy the pregnancy test aha I guess they are kinda lazy but they dont really know what being pregnant is like so I understand them.|`|TdCj89Lraa	Right?  I don't get it either.|`|1G97OBNEaa	I hear ya but I think that most of them will eventually go and buy one but they are probably just looking for some answers to ease their mind a little|`|JemKOsFzaa	They want comfort and reassurance!   If one day something like this happened to you then you'll understand too. You don't know what's it like living with worries and uneasiness all day.  And plus, this is the Pregnancy section like someone said, if we don't ask about Pregnancy, then what are we suppose to ask?|`|G0QugnQ8aa	an EPT isn't always entirely accurate...I was pregnant despite having 3 of those tests coming back negative...I had to have a blood test done because my hormones were outta whack..I ended up needing extra hormones to promote the development of the baby..the perinatologist said that I could have been as far along as 4 months before one of those EPT test over the counter things finally gave me a positive result..if any of these chicks are in the same boat that I was then I think that you should cut them some slack..oh yeah, and I got prego on the pill while also using condoms...so birth control isn't EVER 100%!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	LMAO THANK YOU|`|dPULl5hjaa	High five to you!|`|d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	Those questions are a waste of time, how the hell do we know?|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	Well a lot of people want to be pregnant so bad that seeing a negative result just is not enough.  For the people that just don't go buy a test I have no idea!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I agree...  But I also think some of them are terrified and not thinking straight.   Plus several get a negative test and are still confused.   :)  I would never ask that myself.   I have four children. With my first I missed periods, my breasts got larger, I assumed I was under stress and gaining weight.   Some people still don't know how babies are made.  But others are trying..|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Better yet, why can't they just take birth control if they don't want to be pregnant? What's sad is most of the people who ask are minors who do not want to be pregnant, but they went off and had sex anyhow.
594a0c66946e5dbfa3499a4a976e0422aa	put her on the floor with some toys and let her figure it out on her own. There's not much else you can do but give her a little tush push in the right direction she'll get it|`|xMNpzFzGaa	She'll figure it out on her own! My sons did the same thing--- getting on their bellies and the knees just give way. They just need to figure out how to coordinate their hands and knees. She'll start creeping like a worm at first and later on you'll be surprised!|`|OG3lycSPaa	You should rent The Baby Human (2003)  Its a documentary very informational and has a section on crawling/walking.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	my son is doing the same thing.  I'll be watching him and playing with him, but if I leave the room for a few minutes I'll come back & he's moved 3 feet & is facing a different direction...little bugger.  I think we just need to keep playing with them & they'll get it soon  Have fun!  : )|`|bXeHr69Vaa	leave her as she is ,our children used to use a swimming action before they picked up what to do, then you will really have to keep an eye on her|`|JB8samC7aa	You don't need to help. She'll get it, they all do.|`|qLkknQx1aa	i didn't help either one, i let them figure it out on their own. they both learned at their own pace.  i never pushed them to do anything their little bodies weren't ready for.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	babies dont have kneecaps until they are 2 years of age or around then,  they will crawl weird, so you just have to make sure she isnt hurting herself.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Let her go at her own pace.  I was so worried about one of my twins.  She started to crawl on her 1st birthday.  She was a late starter but she is all fine now.|`|S21rftTmaa	Put her on the floor.|`|4ZwGu3hyaa	Make her love something, like buy her a bear and make her adore it, then put it two feet in front of her. That way she'll try to move forward and get it. Or, if she's just to lazy she'll cry; hopefully the first. I'm not a parent so I don't really know, but that's what I'll try.
zhJOZhKEaa	"... I know that no one will want to do that."    Well tough for them.  The toddlers would *love* it... and if I get the point of your assignment they are trying out an activity you could do *with* a group of toddlers.  If they don't want to play with pudding then they are in the wrong class.    And honestly I don't see why they would hate that any more than the peanut butter playdough even if they were the whiny sort.  Beyond the allergy issues that is a great idea too by they way.  You may want to have a 'non-peanut' option in case the teacher asks what you would do if you had peanut allergies in the toddler group you were handling.  Dough from a no-bake Oatmeal cookie recipe perhaps?    Good luck!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i wuld be more worried about the nut allergy thing than the choking.  A fun toddler thing that we did at my moms group recently is to make an I Spy bottle.  Take empty clear plastic water bottles with the label off and fill them about 1/2 way to 3/4 full of white rice then let them pick out fun things to add to the bottle, we had sequens and little plastic dinosaurs and foam hearts, and rubber bands,  basically any silly little craft things that are fun adn colorful then put a dab of hot glue on the inside of the lid so that when you screw it on its permanant so that they cant get the stuff out to choke on.  Its a fun things for them to shake up and tell you what they see and find hidden in the rice.  You will need help with this though, as with any project with toddlers, they will need guidence and help, and someone to monitor that no one puts anything in their mouth.|`|AA10384043	As long as there are no actual peanuts in the peanut butter you will be fine. The only thing I can see as a problem is the potential for peanut allergies. If you can make sure no one in you practicum is allergic to peanuts, that would be fine. Just include in your presentation that before you do anything with food products make sure none of the toddlers have an allergy to it.
GWveqx61aa	every healthy person has a 20% chance of conception, so it is possible, if i were you id track cervical fluid and do ovulation predictor kits, hope this is your month_good luck and baby dust to all of us_
YeMI2xwiaa	Well there is no way to tell them that would make it hurt less.    Just tell her flat out "mom I am pregnant".     When I told my mom, I sat her down and told her. I told her how I knew I was pregnant, who the father was and the fact that he wasn't going to be in the baby's life. She was extremely disappointed, but we have been working things out.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You just have to tell her.  It's going to hurt no matter what.      Your boyfriend will need to get a job after school now, to help financially support that child.  No time for you and him.  Starting Monday he's to go out job hunting once school lets out at 3 or whatever, and goes out every day until he finds a job.    Now you can talk to other teens about why premarital sex is such a bad idea.  Maybe you can stop others from doing it before they start, so they won't wind up making that same mistake.  Good luck.    Edit: When people are ready for sex, they are ready to handle the consequences of it.  This isn't geared at you, but geared at people who think, ah, nevermind.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you just tell her.. you can't keep it from her much longer because you need the proper prenatal care. good luck!!!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	There's no sugar coating it and there's no beating around the bush.  Just tell her.  Preferably when the two of you are alone and there are no distractions.  "Mom.  I know you are going to be disappointed and angry with me, but I have to tell you something.  I'm pregnant."  Once the shock wears off, I'm sure things will settle down and you two will work your way through this.|`|tM35loy4aa	Just tell her that you want to talk to her. Say that your sorry and your boyfriend will support your baby.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	If you knew they would be so disappointed, you shouldnt have done it.   Any way you tell her it is going to hurt her, might as well just tell her.  You really should have thought about this, your only 16.|`|LX42iJyCaa	sit her down and tell her plain...and maybe he didnt ejaculate but he probably had really strong sperm that can escape the penis without him ejaculating. i call em swimmers|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Whenever you have something hard to say, just say it real fast, but since this is different maybe you can tell her and she will understand what happen if you did it only once without well you no, but i am sure she will be fine since she's an adult and all, just say it how you want but you must tell her now then later because then she might be upset you didn't tell her :) goodluck and congrats im sure things will be fine! (i hope for your sake and the baby)|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	tell her that u are pregnant. tell her that the father of ur child is wililng to support. and tell her too that u need her the most this time,. goodluck and congratulations on ur new baby. xx|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	Wow she told you to tell her when you were ready and she told you, you were too young in a way its her fault not completely!   I would just sit her down tell her you need to talk to her!  "mom come sit down i need to talk to you"  "you remember how i told you i was ready to have sex"?  "well i have been having sex with _____(boyfriend name)"  "we have been using condoms"  "but this last time was unprotected"  "and im pregnant"      have you decided what you want to do keep it or have an abortion or thought about adoption?always remember this guy is telling you this now but most young guys change their minds when it gets closer to the baby actually coming you have a really big decesion to make and i wish you the best of luck!  Im 18 i work really hard live on my own and i know i couldnt support a child on my income now!|`|AA11433102	If you are really scared to tell her write her a little note saying you are pregnant and leave it in her room.     You can write something like..I I know you have always wanted the best for me but there is something that I have to tell you. I'm pregnant.    In that note you can write other things like how you feel and how you need her support.|`|029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	Well it's going to be hard either way. Tell her that you understand that she is having a hard time with it because you're her child, but that children make mistakes just like everyone else. Tell her that you know it will change a lot, and that you understand that she's asking a lot of you by asking for her emotional support. When all is said and done, no matter what takes place during the conversation, tell her you love her at the end of it.     And don't let anyone on Yahoo Answers pressure you into an abortion. That's a personal choice for a reason. Granted, its' not one I agree with. But that's not something you should be concerned with, either. Do what you feel is best.    Just in case: If your mother may get violent with the father, then you need to let him know when you plan on talking to her. If she may get violent with you, then bring along a trusted adult that can protect you, and remember that you're not just protecting yourself but also this child. A pregnant person should not be in a physical fight, even if it's one that they could win.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	tell her when shes cool n try to xplain her wat ur going though.... im sure she will stand thy position  (not a first but ur chat will end)|`|UWuVQ9pUaa	Your mom was so honest with you .. even she trusted you.  As you said that she said.. "if you ever wanted to have sex you should tell her.."    So  you see... she was so honest from the beginning. I am sure its your fault now.     Your 16... why do you think of sex, still you got a long life to live.   Are you sure.. your BF would take care of your baby ???   Are you sure 100% ???     Don't hide any more.. let your mom know.   Be responsible .... in every word or act she might do. Be honest.|`|PPW7TmGYaa	You could just flat out tell her,  which would be the better option.  Or, you could leave a pregnancy test somewhere that she will see it.  While your at school, or something.  That way she'll have more time to cool down.|`|GLXWgR9qaa	u just tell ur mom she feel may b disspointed bt she is ur mom so she give u beter advise compare to the other peapole and now u know u r too young and not mature i mean u r 16 year old and now u r pregnant i think before ur pregnancy u dont think this is not good time 4 doing a sex bcoz u r not mature anyway u should tell ur mom about ur pregnancy its good 4 u now u make a mistake and if u dont tell ur mom so this is ur 2nd mistake so plz go and tell her
FA710vETaa	i would def tell my mama first good luck|`|1vOLtX7Kaa	I say don't tell them unless you have too. And if you have too, tell them both at the same time so one parent doesn't seem out of the loop.|`|mFZGIPcWaa	I would definately talk to mom first. She can be the one to talk to dad before he flips off the deep end. Fathers are very protective over daughters, but if you are close with your mom, and you feel you want to talk about it with her, she would respect you more for going to her and talking about it rather than keeping it from her. She can also take you to the doctor to get on birth control or buy you condoms so you don't get pregnant.|`|X7fJjXFuaa	is there any reason you have to tell them in the first place? unless you're health is at risk, there's no reason to involve them in your choices.    i don't know what your situation is, but i hope you are using protection like condoms and another birth control method to back that up.     if you need to talk to a doctor, try to find your local planned parenthood. they can give you plenty of information about what options you have to protect yourself and your partner. all visits are confidential.|`|yYOh0DUjaa	I would never tell them unless you have too. But, tell your mom first.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	where's the guy?  have him tell them...  man enough to do you but  not man enough to face the parents.|`|H4pqDG09aa	I would talk to your mom. It's scary, but your parents love you and no matter how scared you are or what you think they will do, it will all blow over.

ngUs311Naa	i would say yes only because of the sex you had 12 and 9 days ago... for most every woman (28 day cycle) ovulation happens 14 days prior to bleeding and the sperm can survive up to 5 days in the uterus/fallopian tubes... because it falls near your ovulation it is likely, and in general any time you have unprotected sex its likely (we all know that)... its way to early to tell, and even in early pregnancy there can be some spotting/bleeding as the embryo implants into the uterus which you may mistake for your peroid... best thing to do is act like you are until proven otherwise... If your peroid comes normally (i.e the flow and days are all the same) you should be in the clear, however if you have doubt then take some vitamins, dont smoke or drink and wait until after you are done spotting, take another preg test... first morning void... and you ll have more evidence    finally my advice would be you can have a serum preg level checked by the doc if you really must know... or if you are that concerned take the morning after pill to be safest... that way you have more reassurance that even if you are pregnant the embryo is barely 4 cells...    talk w/ your doctor or see family planning office... and please please please as  a practitioner i cant stress enough carry condoms with you.. too much suffering/aids/pelvic inflammatory disease from gonorrhea/chlamydia to take those chances... its just too risky    I hope everything works out like you want it too...|`|x0Ftr35Laa	yes. The soonest you are suppose to take it is the that your period is suppose to start. Also first morning pee is the the best.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	yes, even those tests that claim you can test early are only 60 %accurate before your missed period. With my first i didnt get a positive until several days after my missed period.  Wait until your period is due and try again.
GWveqx61aa	id wait until at least march 4th to test, but it sounds like you had sex at around the right time, even though you did have sex at a good time, conception dont always happen right away_good luck and baby dust to all of us_
fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	what ever happened to the old saying first comes love then comes marriage.........then comes the baby in the baby carriage... i think if you plan on being with your girlfriend for a long time you should think about marriage first..... and enjoy each other for a while things completely change after a child and if your relationship isn't strong enough it may not be able to handle the change|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You should wait until you finish college so that you are financially stable.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	When you two are ready to have a child together. There is no formula when and when not to have a child.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Age has nothing to do with it.  are you finacially ready? have jobs? a place of your own? the time?    then go for it.  if not then your not ready.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Did she go to college or is going to?  Are you going to college?  Do you both have stable careers?     Better to wait until you have all these things set to have a baby.  Yes people have done it and gone to school etc. but it is WAY harder that way.  Do what you need to first, then have the baby when you are settled.  You are so young you have plenty of time.|`|qLkknQx1aa	age does not make a difference, it depends on how mature and stable you are. - i know some 18 year olds that are doing better than some 40 year olds. - in this day, it is better to be prepared financially and mentally. - if there are things YOU want to do in life, do them first or you will always have that "shoulda coulda woulda" in the back of your mind. - live your life first before you bring one into the world.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	What a silly question. Get married first. Get a degree... so you can actually support the baby on your own. Age has nothing to do with it.|`|AA10027086	there is no right time for everyone. it differs for everyone. my personal opinion is that you are too young to be a dad. shouldn't the first step for you two be marriage?? babies sound fun but they are a lot of hard work. you have to be financially stable to be a parent. babies are NOT cheap.  i think you and your girlfriend should take time to enjoy each other, and after you commit to each other, then you can add a baby to the mix.|`|pnxEgqQuaa	Are you financially stable, have a job, home, are you prepared for responsibility.....  Personally I would have my first child before 32 but after 25 because I would like to finish my career and travel the globe. A child is too much responsibility. And you being 18 and her 23, it just doesnt seem right at the moment.|`|NCSKeRXTaa	get married first
k4uZwN0daa	I am 26 and a mother of a five and nine year little girl. My father would not let me do things when i was younger and was very protective of me. I t is not that your Father does not trust you, it is that when you leave and go to the dance things are out of his control. If you want to approach the situation again, i would recommend asking him when he is in a good mood, and maybe write him a letter. That is what i would do when my Father would not listen. Just let him know it is for a few hours, and that he cant take you. That you are a smart girl, and would not do anything he did not approve of. That you respect him and the fact that he is concerned but you would like to attend. Also let him know that this would give you a chance to see what the High School is like. Also maybe say well if I had an early Birthday I would be in High School right now. I understand where your Father is coming from High School is so much different then Junior High. He is worried about you, and worried that something could happen. If he says you may not go then you do need to respect that to avoid punishment, but realize he is only doing it because he loves you not to be mean. Just be Thank full you have that kind of unconditional, and there should be more parents out there that do guide there children. Good Luck !|`|qTldrel4aa	U COME 2 MAH HOWS!  AND BRiNG FRANDS!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I think he is upset because its in high school and maybe he thinks there will be drugs etc.   Maybe you can talk to your mom and she can talk to him? If not then just tell him that there will be bunch of teachers supervising, maybe tell him that he can drop you off and pick you up ( I know its lame but at least you get to go to the dance) and tell him you will do extra chores etc...  If you were my kid I would most likely let you go ( If what you told me about yourself was true) If you would screw up that would be it for you and partying. Maybe you can tell that to your dad too. To just give you a chance to show how responsible you are and then do not screw up. Come home the time your dad gives you and behave. I hope you get to go, dances were fun :)   It might upset your dad because he sees you as his little girl and a highschool dance is more 'grown up' than hes used to.. dads take a while to get used to seeing their daughters growing up|`|gILygKvRaa	maybe something happened with his sister or someone whose a female close to him|`|ZtuLKde8aa	Respect your father- he knows best.|`|7UIoQFKJaa	hes probably afraid tht ur gonna get hurt?|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	So far it sounds like your parents have done a pretty good job in raising you. In todays world kids at your age go off and do some pretty crazy things. He just wants what is good for you and doesn't want to see  you hurt or in the wrong. You have a looong time ahead of you to have fun and if your boyfriend is really worth it he will still be around. It will all be worth it.|`|cN9sOZfDaa	ah that happened to me [:  i'm in the eighth grade too & my friends wanted me to go to the dance with them, i had to sneak out :D    but anyways, i think you should listen to your dad. he knows best [:  or try asking your mom instead ?|`|H2T2pKvXaa	My parents are pretty much the same. When I want something I ask what can I do to gain your respect so that I can go. Be at you best all week and talk to your dad. Tell him it is supervised by teachers and there are only 14 year old's there. If he doesn't give in then the only thing left is to use the oldest trick. Suck up to him.

Be the bigger (more mature) person here and just move on.  If he wants to be a player, let him, but don't ever give him the chance to play you!  Find somebody better than him, because you deserve better!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	*rolls eyes*  No, you shouldn't.

Also if you do check out the Chinese Gender Predictor, I don't suggest going by that completely while I hear it's accurate for some women, it was wrong for me I did that one plus some other Gender Predictors, they ALL said I was going to have a boy and my baby is all girl, no doubt about it.

ROJans2Taa	perfectly normal, up until around 26-28 weeks, the movements can be very sporadic, with my second, id go a few days before I could feel him again, then by 28 weeks, id feel him regularly. it depends on how the baby is turned, they still have alot of room, so it`s most likely turing away from where you can feel it. congrats and good luck|`|79eRDIbXaa	Yh some days my baby wont move as much as she does other days.

I even went to the hospital the one day because I was so scared. But he has fine. I would wiggle my belly move all around and I still would not feel him move. Doctor also told me the next time I get worried to try and drink a cold coke and sure enough I felt him move around then.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Its normal to not feel them everyday until about 25-27 weeks. <br>  Then you should feel them everyday and strongly.
Ccq8zEcnaa	The best time to do a 3D/4D scan is at 30 weeks. This is the optimal time because your baby will have a good bit of baby fat, and won't be skeletal anymore. And at this week, they still have some room to move around, unlike if you wait past 30 weeks they become cramped inside you. I had mine done at 31 weeks and the pics were awesome. Check out the links to see my 3D pics at 31 weeks.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/Jas71822/m_58632bde24f0424d920389404265169f.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/Jas71822/m_74d817f283f34a138fe728bbd9b8dd41.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/Jas71822/m_88101c0551384dd294bd65a80da2f88d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/Jas71822/m_998c8a8f9c344f98bcd928e33757d6df.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/Jas71822/m_be521dfd2b2b494fa7c4f5697e012a14.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q30/J...</a>|`|3X0t8JrXaa	At 21 weeks you should be good to go but of course the further you wait the more you'll see in development.  4D sono's can be pricey so personally I'd wait till somewhere after 30 weeks...but I'm a cheapskate LOL|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	you can get them as early as 19 weeks, but my cousin who works at an OB's office waited until she was almost 30 so she could see almost exactly what the child will look like when it comes out! and let me tell you.. that was the best idea... b/c it didnt look so much like an alien, but more like a little person ready to live its life!  and he looked exactly like the pic when he came out... so if you can hold off for a little while, i would just to see the best pic possible! and also, go when you know that the baby is the most awake! the more they move the more pics they can get! good luck!|`|bo4MguzVaa	Well the place I'm dong it at has different packages for the sonos.

Ka52nbhNaa	It is usually due to a chromosomal defect.  In conception, you are counting on the sperm and egg to meet, to implant successfully and then to start dividing correctly . . . if even some small random thing does not go right you are at risk for not becoming pregnant or having a miscarriage . . . it is such a delicate process.    I am so sorry for your loss!|`|DNygQdmVaa	Ive had one miscarraige theyre very hard to go thru.  unfortunatley their very common. and noone quite knows why they happen or what causes them.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Women have miscarriages for many reasons.     In most early miscarriages the woman's body detects something is genetically wrong with the fetus and the body ends the pregnancy. A woman's body is designed to spend resources on producing healthy offspring, so it will end a pregnancy where there is a problem with the child.     Other causes are related to problems in the uterus like malformation of the uterus, polyps, or cervical issues. There are many other risks to a pregnancy like uncontrolled diabetes, polycystic ovaries, high blood pressure, and tobacco use.    Many, many women go on to have healthy children after a miscarriage. In fact a friend of mine had a miscarriage over a year ago and she is now due with a healthy baby in april.     Miscarriages are usually not the fault of the mother, and cannot be controlled or anticipated. All you can do is mourn your loss and move on to live a full life. If you are still able to have another child, you can always look forward to that event.     If you cannot have children of your own, there are millions of children in desperate need of loving adoptive homes. You can still be a parent if that's your life's dream.|`|eemmWU0Haa	I've had many miscarriages also, what do you mean One ruined your life?...I don't get your question there sweets:S|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I think babies have to be born at the right time, and some miscarriages happen because it's just too soon. One of my best friends had a miscarriage, and ended up having a baby almost exactly a year later. If she'd had that first baby, I wouldn't have met her in Childbirth class, our babies wouldn't have been born two days apart, and we'd never have been friends. So I think when you miscarry, you should be sad, but also realize that it wasn't meant to happen and that nothing you did or didn't do caused the miscarriage.|`|8YltlMsjaa	I have had two of them, and am now pregnant again. So my hunny and I are crossing our fingers, and going to the weekly appts that my dr made for me. I am on strict dr care now     People have them because it is your bodies way of telling u that there was something wrong with the baby. it is not your fault, or anyone elses. How far along were u when u have the miscariage, if u dont mind me asking..I dont mean to be rude,      Hope that helps sweetie*|`|801022f65fca3e71187b34a99f036a2baa	There could be many reasons.  In short, its due to a major problem with the embryo or its environment.  The most common reason is chromosomal defects, which is a good thing.  It could also be a problem with the mother's reproductive system, but that's usually only diagnosed after recurring miscarriages.     I've seen it cited many times (but difficult to prove in a study) that most researchers now believe that at least half of all pregnancies miscarry between 1-2 weeks (most being interpreted as a late period).  After the first period, 10% are lost and 5% are lost before the end of the first trimester.  The rates drop dramatically once a heartbeat is detected.     It is common to be angry.  Sad is normal too.  I was despondent after my miscarriage to the point I did everything to get pregnant again because I knew I couldn't handle it.  Having my son right after helped me a lot but I'll always be a little sad about that loss.|`|fee7b78886652b6f7ca94b658c0b56d1aa	IT TAKES SO MUCH TO MAKE A BABY...250 MILLION SPERM...AND 1 OUT OF EVERY 5 WOMEN MISCARRY.

10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Best way to work out what needs childproofing is to lay on the floor and look around at the same level the baby does. You'll see all kinds of hazards you might not have thought about like power outlets and power cords.    The kitchen is full of hazards - detergents, medicines, hot stoves, sharp knives, appliances etc. If you can put a gate to the kitchen door and block it off altogether, that's a big help. It's what I did, although we have moved all dangerous items in the above cupboards, out of reach just in case and left only harmless things in the drawers and cupboards the child can reach. Or put child locks on all the cupboards and drawers you don't want her to access.    Bathrooms and laundrys are also dangerous with lotions and potions and cleaning products. Child locks on cupboards are necessary if you can't put things out of reach. Also, you can get covers for taps so that little hands can't turn on hot water. You can also turn down your hot water thermostat to a non dangerous temperature. We also have a lock on the bathroom and laundry doors up high so that we can close them off completely.    Good luck. Don't worry though, the best way to keep your niece safe is to supervise her.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Fridge lock  door knob covers  tolet lock  stove lock  outlite covers  door bumpers  gates for stairs or rooms not to go in  corner covers (for sharp corners like a desk)  chair holders (goes under chairs and coutches so that they can not move.   All can be found at walmart  p.s  that is so nice|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Do you have a BigLots where you live?  They sell baby proofing kits (I just bought a bunch today) and they have specific ones for the kitchen, livingroom, bathroom, and bedrooms.  I bought them all for $12 each and it came iwth EVERYTHING necessary for each room.  It beats having to buy everything separately at BabiesRUs.  But if you dont have a biglots, then I Would go to walmart.  They will have everything you need for babyproofing.|`|XyhM6XGLaa	put away anything that can be easily broken  put locks on doors you dont want them to go in|`|59M4xUwXaa	Put child safety locks on all of the bathroom and kitchen drawers and cabinets she can reach. Put the plastic stoppers in all of your electrical outlets. Put table corner bumpers on your tables. Put a lock on the toilet...believe me a toilet is a fascinating thing to a toddler and if you don't want to fish your car keys out of it...it is worth it!!  Keep all cleaning supplies and alcohol out of reach. Protect your electronics with plastic shields. If you go to home depot or Lowes, they have a whole section with baby proofing items. Anything that is breakable...put it up.
PQQipirDaa	you could always go to chuck E. cheese and not pay for the party thing. It is a lot cheaper that way. You have to check with them and make sure it is okay, most will let you bring in your own cake and decorations.    bowling alleys are a cheap thing--with the bumpers up of course.    cut down the guest list, most parents might want to come with their kids. Only have 5 to 10 kids.     At your apartment you can still do something fun and cool. Check out playhouse Disney and nick jr. for cool kids birthday party ideas, invitations, printables, games, food, etc... (my 5 year old showed me this particular section of it) or simply Google it trust me you will come up with some awesome stuff.    Definitely cut that guest list.    Edit: McDonald's is a great idea!    http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-... click the arrows on the left at top or bottom for more themes some are clearly for different holidays but there are more birthdays than anything.    http://www.nickjr.com/party/index.jhtml    game ideas for at home  pinata  pin the tail on the donkey or whatever animal you want  dance contest and freeze when the music stops etc...  face painting  movie time (make sure you have popcorn and movie munchies) this will allow adults and older kids to rest|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	You could always try McDonalds or Burger King, maybe even Pizza Hut.  If not, you could go to a swimming pool which is really cheap per kid and I bet you could even get a discount if you asked them.    G'luck.|`|DrFJfnpBaa	If you want to throw the party at your house i suggest a princess theme.  Maybe ollie koala's would be good. My little sister went there for her 7th b-day and it was a blast.    I think its a bit cheaper than Chuck.e cheeses but im not so sure.    If you can't think of anything then try your home. Get decorations and make a list of diffrent games to keep doing. Like musical chairs or freeze dance.     Whatever works out best.|`|PkksZFnJaa	Well maybe you could use a friends home if it is bigger.  Or you could limit the number of kids.  but house parties that you plan yourself are super fun because you can be as creative as you want.  use some of her favorite things  and choose a theme  find creative games and food  and make your own decorations!  it is so fun!  lol hope i dont sound crazy|`|KRcDX8DLaa	hmm well last summer i helped my friend out with her daughter's 6th birthday party. we actually put on a little tea party for her and about 15 of her friends. It was very fun and very enjoyable. also pretty affordable. the invitations told the girls to come in their finest dresses, mostly consisted of little girls in disney princess dresses, and to do there hair nicely. we had them play and be kids for a while and then we called them in to eat. we served finger sandwiches and pizza cut in small triangles on a platter. for dessert we put berries and whip cream in a serving bowl and came around and gave them a scoop. we pretty much acted like their servents and wore aprons. after, we opened presents and ate cake and painted their nails. all in all it was adorable and they had a blast. you could probably rent out a room somewhere maybe the fire house and get frilly princess decorations. All though 28 kids is a bit much and may be hard to maintain so many little ones. also if you have boys there they most likely will oppose to tea parties. hope that helps good luck!
Rhr1umV1aa	It could be. Or it could be your body trying to adjust to the fact that you are not on the pill anymore. I would wait til your next period and take a test.

It's not the fault of the kids that she is so irresponsible. Why am I saying she is irresponsible?

I hope everything works out for the best, but its really none of my business.|`|qLkknQx1aa	i feel sorry for the kids. - i told myself i wouldn't judge until i heard more about it, now that the cats outta the bag, i think it's pretty crappy of her to do this... now she wants 2 million for an interview w/ oprah? - there is something very wrong with her and the doctors that help push this along. i hope all the kids pull through healthy and strong and smarter than their mother...|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I think she's okey. I personally only want a few children two or three but it's not me deal if she has fourteen children. She probably wasn't planning for all eight probably was thinking seven would be a good number what was she supposed to do when she figured out there where eight? Tell the abortion clinique "Kill seven of them keep one in there preferably a girl please."   It's seriously none of my business so I could care less, I'm sure her husband has a paying job.|`|phAqOpzZaa	I think she should have not had any kids...six was enuff but...she loves kids and i'm just thinking on how much stress this is going to be on her...|`|s2JvJ5alaa	I think its her decision.  If she wants to have 14 children, let her.
9t8pJG5Caa	I'll put it this way, if you are pregnant they should rename you Mary and be on the lookout for an angel to come to you and tell you what to name the baby. ;)  <br>  <br>  I know that I can freak myself out about the possibility of being pregnant to the point that I "create" symptoms.  By this I mean any little thing that happens in my body I KNOW has to be because I'm pregnant.  I could pee the same amount of times one day but on the days I "think" I'm pregnant, that same number of times is now "alot".<br>  <br>  Mind over matter.|`|PRUOSQcHaa	Your chances is that u might get pregnant it is a 99% that you don'tt because hedidn'tt go in side you. I hope you don't get pergnant because you don't want it.|`|hNIof0lbaa	As long as it didnt GO IN, the sperm probably DIED instantly when it hit your outer skin. I wouldnt worry... The more you worry (its true) you will find more pregnancy symptoms occuring!! Just dont worry about it, youll get your period :)|`|7XSPSy5oaa	I see ur very scared to get pregnant...yea it is almost impossible...I wudnt worry about it ur fine..|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You're not at all pregnant.  I think being in fear of pregnancy can bring on what you perceive as symptoms.  I don't think you're crazy but worry can cause a late period, fatigue, and even a nervous stomach (which you may interpret as morning sickness).  If you're on the pill (correctly) you should be safe to have sex should you choose.  If you're really worried use condoms too for that extra comfort.  Good luck to you.|`|NwT6CpRUaa	birth control and external ejaculation. extremely low chance like almost impossible.
el8yX5q3aa	hahahaha  My husband comes home and the first door he hits is the bathroom.  Some people are very regular in what they do...and their schedule never changes.  This is her body and the way she responds.    I do worry about the crying though.  Is she lactose intolerant?  Ask a doctor!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Yes, there is a gastro-colic reflex. Which basically means that when they eat, they poop. It goes away after the first few months when the digestive system starts to mature.|`|avx7bLnKaa	if she is breastfed and under 6 weeks then yes this is normal|`|pj5bUjbQaa	YESSSS! Or at least it has been with my 2 month old!!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Thats awesome. I remember that.. I thought it was her way of making room for the new food in her belly...     I read somewhere that you should never let your baby cry for milk, you should be on a schedule and feed her before she has to cry for it.|`|S3DFPmjaaa	You didn't say how old your baby is, but for a newborn this sounds fine to me.|`|xMNpzFzGaa	Yes! My sons would get changed before a meal and after a meal. Seems as if chugging down milk pushes the poop out. Lol  Babies cry for different reasons too, not just because they're hungry.

89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	once you get your bloody show it shouldn't be too much longer. contractions are a good thing so just keep timing them and start to pack you hospital bag, as long as your water doesn't break try to stay home for as long as you can and get some rest   good luck|`|oIFMohfUaa	Sweety...  labor is HERE.    That is your mucous plug...most likey.    Call your ob or midwife.    CONGRATULATIONS!    Good luck~|`|uQAZEzq2aa	Sounds like it could be anytime now....if your ready to get the ball rolling, there are some things that can contribute to uterine contractions and get you there faster. Forgive me if im being too open but having an orgasm is one way, it worked wonders for me and a few friends of mine. A nice rigorous foot rub is another, and lots of walking. Good Luck!! & Congrats!!!|`|tb0NMaooaa	sounds like your getting closer!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	You are very close now! Too bad for the long contractions... try walking around a lot... You should have the baby within the next day or so... a super bowl baby? how awesome;) congrats!  My labor story was short and quick- 4am with back pain- menstraul like pains, and lost muscus plug... timed contractions when they started to get bad... I took multiple showers- arrived at the hospital at 2pm- i was 6cm dilated!- and had the baby at 4:30pm. I guess I went quick... hopefully its the same story for this next one...
1KppBoKnaa	i had cramps for a month like period was going to show but it never did and i got tired of waiting so i tested 4 times and they were all positive. THen i went to the womens center for a test and it was positive, but then at the drs office it was neg. (a month later)... then i switched drs to a closer one and they scheduled a U/S by that time i was 12 weeks.    we had no idea how far along i was bc i hadnt had a period for 2 months. (i had concieved with no period)    i had no other symptoms except a missed period and cramps. didnt feel pregnant (besides getting fat) until i could feel movement.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I took several tests and they were all negative.  After running one night I felt really sick.  It kept getting worse every time I ran so I thought something is going on here.  I took another test and it said yes!|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	The first time my Dr told me. I had a blood test as I had missed my period, yet naive me never considered pregnancy. I was told over the phone.  2nd time it was a home pregnancy test after experiencing dizziness, always my first pregnancy symptom.  3rd time I had the tell tale dizziness again after 11 months of TTC, took a test and sure enough, positive again!|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I went to the hospital for a UTI and they told me I had one, and that I was also pregnant. Not exactly what I wanted to hear at all.|`|0viZhxi6aa	EPTs for the first two, but my doc had to tell me about my third. I only went to see her because I was feeling stressed and though my blood pressure was elevated. Ooops!|`|DNygQdmVaa	a pregnancy test 2 weeks afte rmy period was due.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	With my first my mom had made a comment to me about me being   b!tchy and asked if I was starting my period and after I yelled at her I realized that I hadn't had my period in over 2 months so I got a friend to go with me after work one night and I took an HPT in the bathroom at Walgreen's lol. Sure enough it was positive! I then had to figure out how and when to tell my mom (I was a senior in high school at the time). With my second I was a week late on my period and I knew from the way I was feeling that I had to be pregnant, so I ventured once again to Walgreen's and took the test in the bathroom and it was positive. After I saw the positive I rushed home (I was married this time around) and put the test back in the box and wrapped it up as a present (it was the day before NYE) and told my husband that I forgot to give him his Christmas present. With my third I was about 7 weeks along when I found out and I already knew by that time that I was pregnant, the test just confirmed it. There isn't really a story to go with my third though.|`|eemmWU0Haa	A pregnancy test.....lol  No wait...God told me:D|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I was puking everywhere!|`|c97b62c8660b1041d9759f33d466797faa	took an hpt, just so to check if the faint spot of blood is really my period on the way.|`|sxBE5qnwaa	With my first one, I took a test. I didnt think I was pregnant, but hubby did. Lo and behold, it was positive. With second baby I went into the doc for a bladder infection and they called me about and hour later and told me not to take the prescribed antibiotic that they had to call me in something else because I was pregnant. So, with first it was EPT test and the second was a urine test at the doc.
d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I was thinking about that earlier. I'd say with my first pregnancy I was one week late and got an instant BFP. With my second, I had no idea that I was even pregnant since I do skip a month sometimes and I had no symptoms what-so-ever. I decided to test anyway and it was instantly positive! What a shocker! I'd say I was about 8 weeks pregnant right then. Oh yeah, one test per pregnancy.    Right now I'm like 80% positive that I'm pregnant since I'm experiencing lots of symptoms, but I haven't found out for sure yet as I haven't skipped my period this month.    I hope this helps some!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	ME!!!!!!!     I tested with an at-home test, Clearblue (digital) it clearly said Not Pregnant when in fact, I was.    I didn't retake an at-home test I went to my doctor.    I will not trust at-home tests and advise everyone to go to their doctor for best results.|`|cB247Azuaa	--smoking a test is probably not the best idea...    --if you have to toke-up, I can think of a lot better things...|`|eemmWU0Haa	& Its took not toke. Good luck.  I only took one test and it was positive.|`|2R1H8B8taa	A girl I know received 5 negative tests before she found out she was pregnant. If you are questioning if you are pregnant, restrain from drinking alcohol and go to a clinic/your doctor as soon as possible.|`|08LAOOgyaa	it depends those tests run on hormone levels an some woman produce les then other and the tests have a standerd level wich does not aply to changes that very
d67ULZQ6aa	Well I woudl totally forget about the first guy. He obviously didn't like you to much if yall talked about going out but a week later he has a girlfriend. It sounds like he is just playing around with you. I would try to get back with your ex. If his whole family likes you then it sounds like you two had a good relationship, but maybe he wasn't comfortable with the rate things were happening. Just talk to him and tell you how you feel. Tell him things will only move as fast as he would like them to. BUT MEAN IT THOUGH. If you truly care about this guy and want to be with him then show him.|`|DN9RZHi3aa	1. There is only one person who knows how this guy feels, himself. He is giving mixed signals, which makes it really hard to tell what he is thinking. I really can't help you with him.    2. In this situation, tell him face to face that you like him and that you want to go out. If there is one thing you must understand is that boys are not mind readers, they rarely ever understand the hints that you give them. So just go up to him and say, babe, i like you, it was a mistake that we broke up, i want to get back together, its the only way.|`|ieusQoDRaa	don't go for either, the situations are not right
t8HPCzrOaa	hun the only way to know is a hpt i had unprotected sex 3 days before my period and the last day of my period also i dont think am pregnant bt everyone is different wait and see if you get ur period if not take a hpt if i missed my period am take a hpt but its too earlier for me good luck|`|XCueIYnYaa	It could be either. I don't understand where you get that right after your period is the "safe time." There is no safe time to have unprotected sex unless your planning on getting pregnant. I had sex 2 days after my period ended and Im now 14 weeks pregnant.   Wait about a week, if you still don't get your period take a test.
s2JvJ5alaa	I'm sure your mother is just having a hard time accepting the fact that you're homosexual.  Usually, it's the other way around.  When my oldest brother told us he was gay, my dad had a hard time believing it while my mother accepted it.  You have to give your mother time to open up to the idea. I'm sure its a shock to her and she wasn't expecting it.|`|bufQfEqbaa	Hopefully she needs time to think about it.  It's cool your dad is okay with it, usually it's the other way around.  I hope everything works out.  I would give your mom space with it for awhile, but don't ever change who you are for anyone!!!|`|MfXGSLDkaa	Duuuuuude.  Hella Dilemma.  Shiiiit.  Haha.  I'm 17, gay.  Waiting to tell anyone until I'm 18.     Anywho.    You're most definitely old enough to know who/what you like, and what you're sexually attracted to.  As previously mentioned, she's just still in the intial, Hi I'm Gay! shock.  It's perfectly normal.  Usually parents have to just let go of all their previous expectations for you and create new ones, to cope.      Usually they immediately think, "Oh lord, I'm not going to have grandchildren." Or something to that effect, but you just have to throw them the facts, straight up.  Well in this case, gay up. :)    You're no different from anyone else.  You just like men, so what?|`|2wzGwV5daa	Give her time to digest what she has learned. She loves you and only wants what is best for you. Eventually she will understand that you do know what you want and who you are. Let her come to you, she will eventually.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	well tell her that you are old enough and that you are gay and proud. good for you for telling. she will come around. it is going to take some time. God bless|`|59M4xUwXaa	Good for you for being honest with your parents and I am sorry your mom is having difficulties understanding you. Just give her some time. Don't bring it up but let her know when she is ready to accept it and talk about it, your there for her. As a mom, I just want my kids to be happy and comfortable in their own skin. So, if my son told me he was gay, I wouldn't judge him but just ask if he is happy and if he said yes, that is all that matters to me. Good luck!!|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	She may think you are too young to be sexually active with anyone.  Don't talk about it with her.  Give her time.  When you are out of your parents' house, you will be free to do whatever you want.|`|WLynh3bCaa	First of all, don't think for a second that she's right- you're seventeen, you know your sexual orientation.  Second, I recommend just trying to be good to her, and don't give her reason to isolate you. With time, she should accept that you are who you are.  If she never completely accepts you, you'll have to have a large heart and try to keep loving her because she is still your mom and she is still important to your life.|`|lwFo3IWtaa	sounds like she is in denial, you will just have to give her time.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I think your mom is right.|`|RTxFNURzaa	Well she's probably just shocked over it. It will take time but she will learn to accept it|`|fscgp7iFaa	I'm sorry but I'm not sure how to solve that. She might except it after awhile or maybe not. I don't know. Best of luck.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	sorry you will just have to give her some time.she will come around.mom's are very emotional you gotta give her time to think tell her you respect her opinion but that you would also like her to accept you for who you are.and that you are still her son.that will never change.she will come around cause she loves you.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	if i was a guy and my son said he was gay i would actually lay down and cry|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Your Dad is right, your mom is wrong, how is she going to tell you that you are not gay? If your gay your gay, it would be like telling your mom shes not straight. If shes not open  to talk about it that might mean shes not OK with you being gay, which is absurd. Talk to your dad and see why shes being so ignorant about it.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	she will get used to the idea. right now she's going through the mom thing.."my little boy can't be gay" "he has to give me grandchildren" etc. give her some time. it'll be okay.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Just keep at it.  Don't give up.    It might take her longer to accept it, but she probably will eventually.  Try not to stress out...she loves you.  It must be frustrating...but she's probably the confused one.    Once she wraps her head around it, I bet she'll welcome the idea with open arms.    Good Luck|`|627pWyVkaa	All you can do is explain it to her. She's probably just hoping you wont be, maybe for family reasons (grandchildren) although you can of course have a family, Its just not what she . Most parents don't usually wonder "is my son or daughter going to be gay?" Right. Your dad maybe suspected all along, and I think its really great hes accepting of it, usually its the men that have trouble with this. I think since its your mom she will learn to accept it but she needs time, and you cant force her too, So just give it time, and maybe in the mean time don't bring any "boyfriends" around just yet, Might freak her out in the wrong way and not help her come to terms with this just yet. When she is ready you two should talk, and just tell her why you feel that way, maybe it will help her, But right now shes just in denial and will get over it eventually. But it will take time.|`|L7QH81Uaaa	Just give your mom some time I am sure that she will except who you are in time.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Give your mom time.     The way she's acting isn't fair and it isn't right, BUT it is how she feels right this minute so show your love for her by respecting it for now. Many adults your mom's age accept gays in theory, but learning that their own child is gay can be too much for them to accept right away. Your mom has had years of "Gay's are wrong and bad" social training. She is going to need some time to adjust.    Your mom may honestly think that 17 is too young to be aware of your sexual identity. Sometimes parents forget what it was like to be 17. Maybe reminding her of how she felt about sexuality as a teen will help, maybe not.     Trying to force your mom into a confrontation is just going to frighten and upset her. Let her try to work through this revelation on her own and keep talking to her about it in a calm and reasonable way. Help your mom remember that you're still the son she loves. She will eventually understand that your sexuality is just part of your life, not the whole thing.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Your mother is in denial! She knows damn well you can have those feelings at your age just doesn't want to accept it, give her some time and she will come around!|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Your mom is probably coming to terms with your orientation.  Unfortunately, being gay has not been culturally accepted in most parts of the world and it may take her some time.  I am glad for you that your dad seems supportive.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	There is nothing you can do really but wait and let her accept it. There are some mothers who wont. Im not saying that yours wont. Just give her a little space. If she thinks about setting you up with girls just let her know that your not into girls. She might need time to grasp the concept.. Good luck and stay strong. If you need to talk to someone you do have your father. At least he understands..|`|r9gBoBLCaa	There is nothing you can do. She is just coming to terms with it.  Best of luck! xx
zi9knUCGaa	People will  buy almost anything. Go to ebay and put in a search for bracelets or necklaces with the specs. you mentioned. You can see what is selling and what's not. You can also get a good idea of what the price ranges are.  or... make a few and have a garage sale with a small table designated just for the jewelry. Figure the cost of materials and add a 50-75% mark up. See what happens|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Depends on age of the child you are gearing the jewelry for. For a kid under ten I wouldn't spend more than five to ten bucks tops. Also, I'd be more willing to buy handmade jewelry if proceeds (or a portion) were going towards a charity to help children. Without a picture, though, I couldn't tell you for sure whether I'd be willing to buy them.|`|623zz8d7aa	That depends on the child. If she is an infant or toddler, I wouldn't buy anything she can break and put in her moth and choke on. Choking is the number one cause of infant and toddler deaths.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Me personally?  No.  Some people might though.  "Expensive" jewelry and children just don't mix in my opinion.  I'll stick to the big, clunky, cheap costume jewelry.  Its more fun to play with and isn't a big deal if it breaks or gets lost.|`|5D0KuT74aa	not much  twine and silver?  dont mach  however if it was pure silver, maybe some gems, i would buy it for about 100 or so|`|Zo7IQX3raa	Some 5 some 8 some 10!|`|Wm6oiW4Haa	It really depends on how the person is. Like, if the person loves jewerly, then they will want to buy it, so they can have a collection of their favorite items. If they don't really like jewerly, then they most probably will skip over that item.     Try maybe saying all the benefits of the item like "Oh look at those beads...so pretty, matches with probably any outift!" Actract them to the item by sentence by sentence.     Again, it depends on the person.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	10 bucks if they are nice
oAQib10naa	She may have flu, which you cannot cure, only treat the symptoms of.  Keep her hydrated and let her sleep. Monitor the fever and if it gets over 103 take her straight to the emergency room.    You don't get fever from constipation.|`|w1necKzYaa	if she is constipated give her a little bit of brown sugar and water and a luke warm bath to keep the fever down!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	she needs to see a doctor.. just in case. but other wise, tylenol for the fever and lots of fluids.|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	Constipation won't cause fevers. How high are the fevers?
tPolDnwlaa	It is likely that you ovulated late and therefore your period is late... I really don't think you are pregnant since pregnancy tests will show positive 100% of the time if you are 3 days late...Stress, weight gain/loss and even lack of sleep can take a toll on your period.  Just relax.  If you are cramping, I'm sure you'll start in the next few days.  If you haven't started your period in another week, take another test just to be sure and if it's negative, call your doctor.|`|tb0NMaooaa	sometimes our bodys skip.   i would give it a bit longer and test again. good luck|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	give it a few more days, i usually have a 30 day cycle and was once 5 days late before AF decided to show up. if after a few more days AF still doesn't come then retest, if its still negative get a blood test done sometimes the Hcg takes a while to show up in the urine.  best of luck and hope you get what you want|`|EePHBGRhaa	stop ******* around and you dont have to worry about it|`|F8m04KSoaa	You are probably stressed which will delay your period - go to the docs for a more accurate test if you are still worried.|`|AA12095483	Three days late isn't nearly enough time to get a reliable reading from the preggers tests.

wiAVa1H5aa	Yes...   3 cycles, 0 cycles (9 months after 1st birth, 1st ovulation) and this last time roughly 4 months leading to a miscarriage.   1st two times he took multivitamins plus zinc, selenium and folic acid supplements, he also was to ejaculate every other day at least, and that's about it.    All I know is that when he was married to his ex he had low sperm count, low motility and poorly shaped sperm - perhaps from stress married to her, perhaps not, and we do fine now.   Probably the stress was the sperm killer the most though, and he's not stressed now like he was with her.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	It took us 4 years before our baby girl arrived.

Showing them love and affection, and making shure that they do well in school. Remembering that they are children and that we were once children too!|`|AA12204338	God and prayer! I had a praying mama and wow...what a difference.  Teach kindness, empathy and good work ethics.  The golden rule.

I know so many moms that just dump them at a daycare, when the mom doesn't even go to work!|`|dlTJQL5Laa	Try to become the kind of person you want your child to be.  Make healthy choices.  Ask for help when you need it.  Go to church, and develop a relationship with God.  Read books.  Learn new skills.  Volunteer.  Tell the truth, even when it's hard.  Apologize when you mess up (be willing to apologize to your child as well).    You will fall short many many many times.  But continue to pick yourself up again.  Join a support group, a recovery group, or go to counseling if you need to.    The result???  Your child will grow up around books, God, a community of people who care about him./her.  She will learn about humility and growth by watching you--because "do as I say, not as I do," is silly.|`|OAyXEtIoaa	children are like spunges, set the example, be careful what you say, listen to them, talk to them like adults and try to avoid the baby voice when they start getting old enough to understand, let them make decisions about things, make things exciting even the little things, provide structure, kids need a schedule of things, liek movie time, or pizza night, family nights, etc. don't sugar coat everything, teach them the realities of life, like saving money, budgeting money, etc.|`|OYgtlTEfaa	First of all, and most importantly, establish who is the parent and who is the child.  The earlier the better.  The first 5 things a child should learn in life is:    Who is mommy  Who is daddy  What "yes" means  What "NO" means  And that the parents are the boss.    You MUST instill the basics of right and wrong well before your child starts school, and is exposed to all the "progressive crap" the school system will attempt to indoctrinate your kids with.    Once a child reaches 8 or 9 years old it's too late.    You must establish guidelines as early as possible.    I do not condone child abuse but a well timed and well placed whack on the @ss, when necessary, gets more results than all the medication and psychobabble in the world.|`|bufQfEqbaa	Consistency, Structure, lots of love and devotion. Teach your child to respect others by using please and thank you, and using natural consequences when appropriate.  For example, if a child argues with you over wanting to wear a skirt to school with no stockings or pants on, and it's cold outside, this is where natural consequences comes into play.  Eventually, they will get cold and want to put the pants on.  An example of having children learn to try new foods: Don't cater to their wants,  if they don't want to eat what you are serving them, then wrap it up and when they get hungry take it out and only offer that.     I am a teacher and see this all the time, Parents always complain saying they can't get their child to listen to them, I wish sometimes I could show the parents how different their child acts at school and show them what we do differently.

lGcpXteaaa	Most people (including me) who have breastfed their babies have fallen onto the dummy. <br>  Because of the comfort my daughter received from breastfeeding, she wanted to BF all the time. When she was 5 months old it got a bit too much. I was determined not to give her the dummy, just because my mother said i was crazy for not giving her the dummy as she obviously had a constant want for suckling.<br>  I gave in when i saw her thumb in the mouth. I thought NO WAY..<br>  There was no way i was going to let her thumb suck, its so much harder to break from them!<br>  So yes, my daughter uses the dummy, now at 10 months its just for naps and bed time.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If your baby is breastfed then they should be meeting their need to suck at the breast.<br>  <br>  If the baby is bottle feeding for obvious reasons the need to suck can't be met at the bottle.  So the baby will use another outlet, or in some cases the bottle resulting in overfeeding.<br>  <br>  If mom's breasts aren't available the best substitute is an adult finger upside down (fingernail to tongue).  This provides the skin-to-skin contact that the baby needs, teaches them to bond with people -not objects, won't cause nipple confusion or thrush.<br>  <br>  Pacifiers are not any better than letting the baby suck their own thumb, in many ways they are far worse.  Thumbs are never abused the way pacifiers are -I have yet to see a parent that shoves the baby's thumb in their mouth anytime they make a noise but this is a common practice among some pacifier users.  A baby can not use both hands (to crawl or play) and suck their thumb.  Thumbs do not breed thrush.  Thumbs don't lost, and they are a lower risk for ear infections (but still higher than comfort sucking at the breast)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t104600.asp#T104601" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t10460...</a><br>  If your own nipples are wearing out, or at least the mom they are attached to is, use your finger (or, better yet, get dad or someone else to give you a break). The skin-to-skin element is still there, and your index finger (or dad's little finger) can be placed more properly in baby's mouth to stimulate sucking at the breast. Many of our babies have been soothed by the touch of my well-scrubbed pinkie. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=94" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/arti...</a><br>  Another reason parents use a pacifier is the hope it will prevent their infant from sucking their thumb. Many adults believe that thumb sucking is a disgusting habit and that children who suck their thumbs instead of a pacifier will develop teeth deformities. Not true, according to pediatric dentists at the Medical College of Georgia who found that children who used "orthodontic pacifiers" had just as many dental abnormalities as those who used ordinary pacifiers or their thumb. Therefore, both prolonged thumb sucking and pacifier uses are equal in producing large orthodontic bills for the parents. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There are other reasons for not using pacifiers. First, pacifiers frequently carry many wonderful bacteria, and in the case of yeast infections (thrush), the ailment is difficult to eradicate as long as parents insist on reinserting the pacifier every time it falls out. The use of pacifiers after 12 months has been shown to interfere with normal babbling and speech development <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Should the child need extra sucking, as some do, why not let them use nature’s pacifier, their thumb. According to pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, "the thumb is always there, and the child can use it whenever they want. The baby who can comfort themselves will become an easier baby to parent." The thumb’s value lies in its being controlled by the child, and not a technique learned by the child at the insistence of the parent. The child given a pacifier for fussing or crying never learns how to comfort themselves. "It’s a stressful world for small children," Dr. Brazelton writes in his new book Touchpoints:The Essential Reference, "and thumb sucking is a healthy sign of competence, a sort of self-comforting way of managing the stresses."<br>  <br>  The overuse of pacifiers teaches our children, "Don’t call me, I’m busy." "Stop crying, I do not want to hear you when you cry." What we don’t think about is that this subtle message may tell our children that we are not there for them. The pacifier, despite its name, should not substitute for vital communication -talking, playing and interacting- between parent and child. Resist the temptation to use the pacifier as a constant tranquilizer, automatically popping the plastic and rubber sucker into the child’s mouth as the quickest and easiest remedy for fretfulness or crying. Instead, moms and dads might want to consider other alternatives, like hugging your baby, rocking the infant in a chair, or just talking to your child. A child who cries has a need, and you’re not going to spoil them with a little holding or cuddling. And remember, they are only young once and will grow up before you know it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=856" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>   How old is too old?<br>  <br>  According to the American Dental Association, thumb sucking does not cause permanent problems with the teeth or jaw line unless it is continued beyond 4 to 5 years of age. As it turns out, somewhere between 85% and 99% of children have finished thumb sucking spontaneously before this period.<br>  <br>  Which children keep sucking their thumbs?<br>  <br>  Many parents are concerned that thumb sucking at a late age is a sign of emotional immaturity or lack of self-confidence. When investigators have looked at late thumb suckers for common traits, they found only one thing in common that distinguished them from other children -- a prolonged history of a strong battle with thumb sucking at an earlier age. It is striking that many well-meaning parents have actually encouraged thumb sucking by trying to forcibly take the thumb out of their children's mouths. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.h...</a><br>  Once the baby is born, however, the suckling instinct is supposed to be directed toward the breast, to get the child nutrition and immunities, and the sucking itself lowers the baby's heart rate and blood pressure. While it can be convenient for the parents to have the baby suck on their thumb or fingers or pacifier (like in the car on trips, or when mother is trying to cook dinner) it nevertheless is clear from both cross-cultural and cross-species field studies that, given complete contact with mother and free access to the breast on demand, human children (and young of our close relatives, the great apes) do not suck on their thumbs or fingers. I never saw a child in Mali sucking its thumb or fingers, in almost three years of watching/observing/studying mother-child interactions. Likewise, thumb sucking is reported to be completely absent from cultures such as the Navajo, in highland Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, the Peruvian Andes, Mexico, Nepal, India, Tanzania, Botswana, and South Africa. A number of other ethnographic studies of breastfeeding don't mention thumb sucking one way or another.<br>  <br>  Thumb sucking is also absent from the great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) except among zoo nusery raised animals.<br>  <br>  I think it is clear that human children have sucking instincts that can persist until 7 or 8 years of age, or even longer, and must meet those needs somehow -- through thumb, finger, or pacifier, if not allowed to meet them at the breast. But I also think that meeting those needs at the breast is the "normal/natural" context or situation, and involves not just lowering the heart rate/blood pressure, but also the transfer of nutrients and immunities, as well as helping the child with thermoregulation from being in contact with its mother's body. It may be that thumb/finger/pacifier sucking "tricks" the child into being "pacified" for the time being, even to the extent of reducing the time spent at the breast. That doesn't mean it is good for the child. In fact, finger and thumb sucking often lead to orthodontic problems. In the U.S. orthodontists even have evil-looking devices they will install in a child's mouth to make it painful for the child to continue sucking their thumb/fingers, in order to break them of this habit. If the child were allowed to meet those sucking needs at the breast, it wouldn't lead to orthodontic problems (in fact, just the opposite, with less orthodontic problems in long-term breastfed kids).|`|deIzFnV8aa	We couldn't get her to take one until about 4 months. After that it has been a mixed blessing. She takes naps better with one to suck on, but she wakes up somtimes at night and cries because it has fallen out.  Babies usually suck on something to self-soothe; I would have preferred it to be her fingers (which can't fall off in the night!), but she only sometimes does that; it is true the dummy will calm her down when fussy, and is especially useful when we are out in public in the evenings.|`|z6IekuwSaa	It lowers the risk of SIDS. And if you take it from them about the time they are 6 months, they won't miss it. It's easy as cake if you take it from them at that age. The longer you wait the harder it is to break though. If your baby has acid reflux or spits up a lot you do not want to use a binkie though. It makes them take in more air and will cause them to spit up even more.<br>  <br>  <br>  I breastfeed and was trying to let my daughter meet her need to suck at the breast. This resulted in two things. One good- it increased my milk supply greatly. One bad- she was over eating and kept spitting up because of it. I don't care what any research says, real life experience always wins for me!|`|s2wJQqK7aa	It doesn't hurt them to have one, it soothes them.  Babies have a natural sucking reflex.

K5TrkUhCaa	Pregnancy tests are most accurate with first morning urine because it's the most concentrated (contains the highest hormone levels). So the best time to tak an HPT would be when you first wake up in the morning.|`|oIFMohfUaa	They tell you to take it in the morning because you have USUALLY not peed in 8 hours.  This makes the pregnancy hormones higher and it can detect it easier.      Anytime you've gone a long time without using the bathroom, you can use it.    Good luck and I hope the results are what you want! ;-)|`|bSZK2tVtaa	Usually works more in the morning like when you first wake up that way it has been in your system awhile and you have not drink anything for a couple of hours..

Sara-|`|0iuvUhMpaa	the very frst pee i the morning coz it is most potent and carries the most hCG... good luck :)  p.s it also has to be when you have missed your period already, dont do it before hand coz it will be way to early!|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	Try it in the morning and best wishes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eeyGYRcPaa	use the pee from the first time you go to the bathroom after you wake up. doesn't necessarily have to be "morning" pee. lol i tested mid day and got a positive two days before my missed period. so...|`|hamdnq5Yaa	first thing in the morning.|`|PYySLOw6aa	it does not matter at all my friend took one in the morning and hers kept coming out neg... and she was pregnant and I took mine at 12 AM and I got a positive!|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Well they always say to take a pregnancy test first thing in the morning. If you stay awake all night and sleep all day (like I do) then you would take it when you first wake up because your pee is more concentrated. So if you are up every morning at 8 take it at 8, If you wake up at 3pm take it then.
oAQib10naa	He may be reluctant because of the feedback he gets from you.  He may simply not be ready for the potty.  Boys generally take longer.    If he's in preschool, sometimes the knowledge that all the kids BUT him are potty trained will spur him along.  Otherwise, simply be as encouraging as you can and be VERY positive if/when he gets it right.  Try not to yell or punish him for the times it's not right.     Pretty much all kids get it eventually.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	Give him little prizes if he does it, or get stickers and give him one when he's done. Try cheerios in the toilet and have him aim for them.

It can screw him up forever. generally little boys take longer than girls to use the potty. I have 3 little guys and my oldest was potty trained at the very beginning of his 4th year. try buying his own little potty, have him sit on it after each meal. Give him lots of kudos even if he doesn't produce anything. Let him sit on it with pants on, then move up to just a pull up and so on. As frustrating as it can be don't make him feel badly about it. All kids will do it when they are ready.|`|IuOxDlzCaa	if he has shown signs of wanting to go to the toilet or telling you when he needs changing then this is the first step towards potty training. and like someone else has said .. when they go to the toilet on the potty make a huge fuss and give them a sticker chart to use in the toilet. but any accidents just assure them that it doesnt matter and remind them gently to tell you if they need the toilet. and as an adult ask them frequently because sometimes they can forget. if they are absorbed in playing they wont think about going to the toilet as much as you would hope! good luck!

UjI3TuSZaa	I'm sure that the taste of cow's milk without nesquik is closer to your wife's milk (unless she produces strawberry flavoured breastmilk!)    Sure it might seem easier now, and of course your daughter likes it - she'd probably like it if you put anythings sugary in it - but you don't want to set a precedent this early. Children's tastebuds adapt to what they're given, so if you give her sweet milk or soft drinks, for example, she'll learn to only like very sweet foods. The same goes for salty.    It's probably not going to do her any great harm in itself, but could impact on the other foods she eats and her attitude to less sweet foods (like tart fruits, plain yoghurt, vegetables etc. ie. all the things you'll probably want her to eat!)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I used chocolate.

I don't guess the strawberry nesquick would hurt her, but it probably isn't the only way.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Once you start adding the flavoring to the milk you can just go ahead and forget about them ever drinking plain milk! My pediatrician did tell me better flavored milk then none at all. My mom keeps my kids while my hubby & I work and she was the one that started the chocolate milk thing with my daughter. Now she will only drink chocolate milk. I now have a 14 month old that she keeps as well and she gives him vanilla soy milk! Drives me crazy! So I have had to search everywhere to find powdered vanilla flavoring to add to cows milk so he will drink it at home...I sure can't afford the flavored soy milk!|`|gyzMxjAiaa	You are giving her sugar she doesn't need and exposing her to artificial colors and other things that are not healthy. You are also setting her up to always prefer sweets. Start adding a little cow's milk to a bottle of breast milk, then increase the amount of cow's milk every day. It will take longer but be a lot healthier.|`|irGE84Qdaa	i think its too early,but this is wat i think u should better ask to the child's DR.|`|Th41fwymaa	It is far better to transition from breast feeding by giving your child milk from the mother via the bottle than to give the infant cow's milk with nesquick. The sugar content in nesquick isn't healthy for such a young baby and mother's breast milk is much healthier than cow's milk. It is proven that children who were given breast milk as infants grew up to become stronger and healthier. If you give your baby a scoop of nesquick this early in his/her's life they will grow up tending to eat sugary foods rather than choosing healthy foods. Perhaps try puting breast milk into a bottle and after a week or two give your child plain cow's milk. Best of luck!|`|ia3XD8KDaa	NO! the bacteria will kill him because he is too young|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	Going from pure breastmilk to that sugary crap does not seem like a smooth transition at all.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	no why are you giving that baby junk food?  give him goats milk..its sweet like breast milk and has all the fat he needs for brain development..and give him vitamins to suppliment

You don't need that and all it will do is lower the scrutiny of your mom on you.|`|70kh6VSoaa	talk to her again and just tell her exactly that and if you want throw in there that if you do have sex which she cant really stop that she wont have a grand baby just yet|`|OWw3LWDCaa	you dont tell her that you want to be on the pill for starters. talk to her about why you think you need to be on it. you also need to discuss this issue with your doctor. you come across as sounding fairly young. sit down and talk calmly with your mum.|`|63ca086efa9c06dcd65365a855b00bacaa	If that is what you want to be on it for tell your mom that.I don't think that's true about having trouble getting pregnant.If you completely go off the birth Control pills when you are ready to have a baby then you shouldn't have a problem.I know it can be difficult to talk to your mom about these things sometimes,but if this is really your choice you've got to prove to her that the reason you want the pill is not so you can have sex.good luck.
ooaT4uGraa	You are supposed to start with vegetables, simply because children like the sweet taste of fruits, so if you start with fruits, they are more likely to be picky when you try to introduce veggies.   It doesn't really matter which veggie or fruit you try next, but bananas have a high allergy rate, because they are acidic (they have high amounts of citric acid). My son is 16 months and is just now able to eat bananas without getting a rash and tummy-ache.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	veggies then fruits   that way they dont get a sweet tooth|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	you are supposed to start with all the veggies and then move onto the fruits, this is because the fruits are sweet and they are more likely to resist the veggies, if you start with them first. green beans, peas, sweet potatoes (always my kids fave) carrots, squash, umm...cant really think of anymore, its been a while.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	bananas- they're softer.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Yes, to all the above.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	bananas they are soft and my 1 year old loves them!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	If you have waited 4-7 days, I'd go with pears. Bananas can cause a bit of constipation (not always, but just in case I introduced prunes before bananas). I have never heard of peaches as a "first food"    http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/solidfo...|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	i did bananas first with both of mine. they loved them. neither were fond of peaches, but both loved pears too. just make sure to wait about 2 weeks before introducing a new food in case of allergies. good luck. :)|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I was told to start with vegetables because babies might like the taste of the sweet fruit and not want to eat vegetables.  We started my son out on sweet potatoes and moved on from there to different veggies and than went to fruits.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Banana is always a good one, pears are good too    For veggies: sweet potato or butternut squash are good to start with|`|OYwZNRaeaa	Peaches 1st, pears second, and very little bananas. because the iron can make them constipated.|`|qLkknQx1aa	we did bananas. watch out with the pears... they'll make baby have diaper (if you know what i mean). - peaches made both of my kids break out with rashes so we stayed away from them. - start with bland veggies before the fruits though. - if you start with the sweet stuff it's hard to start on those yucky veggies !!!!|`|SIhEme03aa	It doesn't matter what order you go in. Just make sure after you start a new food not to give her anything new for at least 4-5 days. I started with sweet potatoes and peas. I wanted to get some of the veggies out of the way before giving her sweet stuff.|`|ia3XD8KDaa	bannan's you can mash em and he/she could have a more relaxing time when they eat bannan's if there teething|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I started my daughter on veggies first. I tried giving her fruit and she didnt want anything to do with it. I gave her green beans and she nearly ate the whole jar plus her formula. But when she did get on fruit I started with peaches. She didnt quite like them. So the following week we gave her pears and she loved them. The 3rd week she had bananas and to this day she will eat anything that has banana in it. She loves banana yogurt. I would start her on what ever you think is best. I started my daughter on peaches because I know I loved peaches when I was little. Then pears because that was my husband's favorite as a baby. We both love bananas so I did that one last because I figured that she should like them. And I was right she loves them.|`|IcHmWDSCaa	bananas you can mash them|`|ezVqz0bBaa	Banana's - they are very healthy, a nice color and soft.|`|Ai8H5N8paa	maybe bananas but if its like packaged fruit in juice like packaged peaches then they dont have to break through the skin and they r the softest so them,|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	Peaches seem to be the thinnest in consistency, and so it will be easier to swallow, but it depends on your child's ability to swallow.  If she seems to need a thicker-consistency to swallow then bananas, because they're the thickest.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	pears, peaches and bananas are all ok to try next, but really their digestive tract isnt ready for food until they are AT LEAST 6 months old even if they like it and have no visible signs of a problem.  I would hold off on introducing any more food for a few weeks.|`|D7Hxp0zDaa	Applesauce and mashed bananas are great. Also small bits of soft peaches.    As for veggies, try cut up green beans, and cut up cooked (so their soft) carrots.|`|e9jD2SE3aa	I would definitely go with banana because they are very soft and you can mush them up. Also they have lots of potassium in them so it will be gentle on the little baby belly! So, I would definitely start with bananas then if she does well, maybe try peaches next because they are juicy and squishy also! I love babies, she must be so adorable! So, good luck!|`|sZhjGs51aa	if i were  u i would start with   small  pieces  of banana|`|NCSKeRXTaa	try peas and a sweet potato    bananas are good to
qX8EFFVtaa	No magic pill.  Have his sperm count checked.  The most popular technique is IUI, but there are several different procedures.  Look on-line for hypogonadism and assisted reproductive technology (ART).  It's not impossible unless he has no active sperm.  Good Luck!|`|jrCZ6fadaa	It would depend on if they are stunted or null. Al he can do is have a sperm count and see if he has any swimmers. If not, I doubt the is much help. The problem is probably that he isn't even making sperm, not that the sperm isn't being delivered, like with many other male infertility issues., maybe the doc can extract sperm and to IVF.    Good luck.
819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	They usually give you a list of medicine to take and my doctor told me I could only take benadryl and other medicine like that but cough syrup I think is not safe to take while pregnant because there was no cough syrups on the list of medicines I was allowed to take    I had a really bad cough all last week too and I just took benadryl and ate alot of cough drops and put on alot and I mean alot of vicks    Good Luck|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I looked it up for you and here is the website and info:    During pregnancy, this medication should be used only if clearly needed. It is not recommended for use in high doses or for long periods during the last 3 months of pregnancy due to increased risk for serious side effects in a newborn baby (e.g., withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, abnormal/persistent crying, diarrhea, seizures). Tell the doctor immediately if you notice any of these symptoms in your newborn. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.    This medication passes into breast milk and could have undesirable effects on a nursing infant. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended while using this drug. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.      http://fdb.rxlist.com/drugs/drug-15491-C...|`|z7w6xyOKaa	My doctor told me I can take Robitussin DM for a cough|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	My midwife told me I could take any type of Robitussin or the store brand equivalent. Don't take anything with DM though because it has something in it that is unknown whether to cause problems with the baby or if it may cross the placenta. It begins with a G but for the life of me I could never remember it. Just look on the ingredients and active ingredients. Benedryl and tylenol are the only other medicines that are okay to take.    Best of luck, hope you feel better!

The soy products are not fermented properly and are full of hormones, oestregen. These hormones replace the bodies own hormones and are a weaker version. It can cause breast cancer, infertility, early puberty, bad news is soy is in everything now, its so hard to avoid! At least try not to give it to a little baby who has a weaker immune system!  Why would you chance something like this to people on here anyway, go to a doctor!!!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	The more you nurse, the more milk you will make.  There is some kind of shot they can give to stimulate milk production if you need it.  I've heard of it working for adoptive mothers, so I don't know why it wouldn't work for you.  Your daughter is very young, so she will need to nurse every two hours or so, and that's NORMAL.  It doesn't mean she's not getting enough, it means she has a tiny stomach!    You should know that you make milk constantly.  I asked my midwife friend about how long I should wait after the baby nurses to "recharge" so I could pump, and she said I didn't have to wait at all.  You're producing milk even while she nurses.  Maybe a breast pump would help get things going for you.  Even if you don't manage to get a lot of milk with the pump, the extra stimulation might help.    I nursed both my children for a year (one at a time), one petite daughter and one much larger son.  My milk adapted to each one.    Keep nursing and you'll be fine!|`|3JhFz16Maa	Breast Feed your baby.  You are not producing enough milk because the baby is not at the breast enough.  Why are you supplementing?  Stick to the breast milk your baby will be much more healthier.|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	go get a hypoallergenic formula. Either Similac Alimentum, or Enfamil Nutramigen. They run about 27 a 1 pound can, this is the only formula my son can have. He has protein allergies to both milk and soy proteins and it got worse as he got older. Your pediatrician will most likely recommend you to switch to this formula as it's kinda a last resort like I said it's hypoallergenic, it's expensive but it works.|`|irGE84Qdaa	1st of all ask to the DR which formula u should switch to cuz this is v necessary + change the bottle use the DR brown 1 it might help to reduce the gas.and use gripe water for the gas + boil some water add aniseed put like 10 to 15 and some mint like 2 leaf and boil it cool it and give 3 to 5 tea spoon after every 2 hours i hope she feel better.  good luck

If your having unprotected sex a lot and are trying to have a baby, then there is a huge possibility that you may be pregnant! You said you were bleeding lightly, so you may be spotting which is one of the first signs of pregnancy! But, there is only way you can find out your pregnant and that is to take a test, or go see a doctor!

8FbOtXAXaa	No, she was probably specifically taken off the Bipolar medication for the safety of her child. A lot of antidepressants are not safe as well as anxiety medicine when you expecting. Unfortuantley, she might start to show some of her old behavior but she can't help that because it is a mental disease. She probably will display the talking way too fast and have dramatic speech or dress overly provacative like she used to. Hopefully whoever she is working for will understand that this is all part of the mental condition.|`|LZAF4DYZaa	Yes you sure can, however most medications meant for patients that are bipolar are classified as category C, which haven't been approved by the FDA, no medication will ever be a category A, anything can happen on any medication....every pregnancy is different. As long as she is still seeking professional guidance from a therapist she should be "stable" enough, medication isn't the only thing that helps while being bipolar, she has to learn how to cope and manage with meds as a guidance, not as a "medication takes all my symptoms away" because it doesn't.|`|AA10186411	There are certain ones that are safe for pregnancy, some that aren't.  Just speak with your OBGYN and your psychiatrist to figure out which is best for you.

e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	You're only going to look like a player if you flirt with a lot of girls, and talk to a lot or girls and is always seen with girls and have your arm around girls and if girls talk about you in the washroom and call you a player.    Lol.    I think you'll be fine if you pick a girl you like and talk to her and get to know her.  Don't act like you're trying to get something - you're not, right?      If a girl sits next to you in class, say hi and ask to borrow a pen or something.  And strike up conversation randomly.  I don't mind when guys around me do that.  I'm still nice to them.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	okay i got slightly lost after the whole french class thing, but why dont you pick out ONE girl to "go after" and then try to get to know her?  if she isnt going for it, wait for a while and then try again with another girl..  that way people wont think youre a player.|`|v05RzzCEaa	Well I think you should go up to the girl that you think likes you and if you like her just say hi to her! If she likes you then she will be glad your talking to her! Just go for it! I wish the kid i liked would do the same...|`|ZiLHLMHzaa	All I can say is be friendly, open and smile. If you see one of the girls from your class down the hall or something and say something like "Hey, your *name here* from my French class, right?" She will probably be flattered that you remembered her name and face.  Also, try sitting amongst the middle of the classroom; that way people can see you and you have a better shot at asking one of the girls for help or asking if they have a pen you can borrow. ;)  Good luck.
kOcYkte7aa	I think im going through the same thing mostly all my friends have babies and are always talking about there babies and i know that i should be happy for them but it really makes me upset because i wish i could be able to talk about my own baby too.Me and my husband have been ttc for  1 year and 5 months but its seemed like forever.I also get very upset when people ask when are you going to get pregnant or why haven't you already gotten pregnant .if it was for me i would already be pregnant .but i always pray and think that god is going to give me my little miracle some day i know it.i hope he also gives it to you too.i know what your going through.its very hard.i wish you the best.best wishes to you and you hubby.and you ll be in my prayers.|`|9243ea0535f139ef664eccb335fe7179aa	yes a lot of my brother in law friends ask me this when are you going to get pregnant?  its frustrating cause my husband has a 3 year old niece now|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	I know how you feel i was in tears the other day because of the same thing. My friend knows that i am TTC and keeps trying to get me to buy bootleg drugs like clomid on line. She said "I did and i got pregnant right away". but she was ovulating and having a period. I rarely get mine she must have had duds because she would probably had multiples. I told her i don't wanna end up with octuplets like that woman on tv!|`|801022f65fca3e71187b34a99f036a2baa	I hate to say it, but maybe your husband and you need to take a break for a few months.  Sometimes the stress from TTC can make it difficult to conceive.  I've heard too many stories from people who don't get pregnant until they give up trying or finally adopt to not believe there may be some truth to it.    Try not to think about the words your friends and family say but their intentions behind them.  Some people don't have the talent for saying the right thing.  I would try smiling and telling them thanks for their kind words.     Feeling anger or jealousy towards people who are not having problems conceiving is normal.  I'm not sure what to say, coming from someone who has never had a problem.  I remember when I miscarried once, though, that I was so angry at my pregnant online friends that I stopped going online for a few weeks until I could deal with it.     I'm wishing you all the luck in the world.|`|GLJkGgloaa	It's frustrating. I know.  I was watching TV about a mother who had 6 girls but really really wanted a boy.

I just want one...and if the lord sees fit i would LOVE another. But Right now, I just want one.    Also my cousin just had a baby and she was like "When are you and your husband having kids blah blah blah..It only took me 3 weeks to get pregnant the first time "...I wanted to shout well great for you "B****!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Have you been honest with them about your situation? People can only be sensitive to you when you are able to be forthcoming with your struggle. People want nothing for you but the best. I know this very hard, because I have been in your shoes, but if you can assume positive intentions of people instead of taking in personal, it will be much easier for you.
qOqbq0FZaa	Make sure you switch to your husband's insurance before you quit work, if you're not already on it. Have some kind of retirement plan started for you, don't rely solely on his retirement plan. If your kids were on your insurance, change them ASAP.  Also, make the most of your old insurance (if you have it) before you quit- have any exams and tests done before you go off it.<br>  Make sure to keep up with certifications and new developments in your field, even if you're not working.You never know if you will have to go back to work because of change in circumstances. <br>  Money wise, I think you will be ok. It seems like your income won't go down that much, since you didn't make much to begin with- you could probably cut those couple hundred by cooking exclusively at home, and planning your grocery purchases.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	My suggestion would be to make sure that you have the patience for it.  It is a more "full time job" than any you've ever worked before and you really don't get "time off".  <br>  Second, if you sell your husbands truck, I suggest making sure you have a back up that you own, these are uncertain times and you don't want to be stuck in a layoff situation.<br>  Otherwise, have fun and enjoy your family.|`|fZGBjtpVaa	I love being a SAHM, you get to choose how your children are brought up, instead of the childminders way (no offence, my daughter was in childcare for a year).  You get to see all those precious moments, take them out on day trips, playgroups to meet friends before they start nursery.  Spend quality time with them, catch up on that dreaded housework!  Just give a duster to your children, they love joining in!
PgIbB8tXaa	I really don't like Miami and Shakira for the twin girls names, it would've been much nicer and still quite unique as just Candace Olivia and Angelina Kaelynn - its just too much.  The other 2 names are pretty plain but still fine. Ashley Lauren is pretty but very common.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	I don't like the first 2 girl names, the boy name does sound too old Ashley Lauren is cute, it's very common|`|lGSUToFQaa	i like Cadance and i like kaelynn that's it|`|CdGOuEmpaa	rly don't like the twin's names... russel is okay, and ashley lauren would be better Lauren Ashley...  will u vote on my names now plz??  http://babynames.com/namelist/9682170|`|pdtAmIPyaa	i like none of them...russel is wierd...and the girls r all a mouthful...excet ashley, i like that one|`|MSfuRuqCaa	not a fan of Shakira and Miami. Sounds like they were trying too hard to be creative. Love Ashley Lauren and Russel Matthew though|`|c8WPYjU3aa	their ok
AA12234654	I am not sure how I feel, but her mother said she was not going to be there to take care of them, which I don't blame her, that's a lot to ask anyone, just the thought of how do you feed and diaper this many children, with two children I found formula and diapers to be an outrageous expense, also I don't see how she is going to be mentally and physically able to care for them.  So I do worry about their care, and I do think it is highly unethical of the Dr.|`|FA710vETaa	i think she is amazing and no she shouldent have aborted them abortions are selfish i have no respect for baby killers|`|AA11503798	No doctor should plant 8 embryos.  It is against the reporductive guidelines and is just crazy.  Unhealthy for all!    Also, something about this story doesn't make sense.  If the procedure costs $10k and she already had 6 kids, that is $60k before the latest 8.  Parents $1M in debt, and grown daughter is living at home spending money on having babies???  Who paid for all this?  Who is covering medical for mother/babies?    This story will get more bazarre!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Presently, there iisn't much reliable information about her case, other than she gave birth to eight babies way before term, has six other children, and lives with her parents.  Everything else is rumor and people rushing to judgment.  I'm just relieved she and the babies are doing well so far.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	she should never have had the implants in the first place.  what about the 6 she already had all children need nurturing and a mothers love and attention. what life are they going to have now, the centre of media attention and stuck in a corner cause mommy hasn't got enough hours in the day for them. but never mind as long as mommy is famous and the centre of attention it doesn't matter does it. you could be mother theresa and you still couldn't give all those children the time and attention they deserve it is so unfair on the existing kids in that home.   she is being a selfish woman and can't possibly say she loves her children or she would never have gone ahead with it she would have put her time to good use to look after the one's she already had.     there are women out there desperate for 1 child and she has 14 that there is no way she can give them what they need.     she needs to take a long hard look at herself cause if that was me i would feel ashamed that my older children have effectively lost their mother those children needed her imagine how they are feeling now.   it makes me shudder|`|jYPeis3Saa	she seriously needs her head examined.   and the doctor who implanted al thoes embryo's needs to have his licence taken away.    i was reading an article today and her mother stated that the she had been obsessed about having children since she was a teenager. that speaks volumes to me. she really does need to have a mental/psycholocial exam.     it seems that she cant even take care of herself if shes living at home with her parents.    id also like to know how the hell she got the money to pay for all these fertility treatments? as far as i know most cost $10,000 each attempt.|`|0g3gVfKYaa	This woman has half a brain. No husband and already 6 children including twins. Her mother is right to let her get on with it and leave her to it. I'd say money is at the bottom of it all. I think the doctor is a nutter too, maybe he was the sperm donor, now there's food for thought  This would not be allowed in most civilised countries because somebody has to foot the bill and tax payers are sick of paying for unnecessary items. And he should not have implanted any she already has enough as asolo parent.|`|ggETPqedaa	I think people simply need to leave her alone, it's not their problem. There's conflicting information out there, so no one knows the true story. So leave it be.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I've read conflicting reports, she is married and he is currently overseas, she isn't married and is obsessed with having a lot of children.    If she can afford to properly care for them, then I have no opinion. If she gets assistance then I have a problem with it. It isn't up to all of us to pay for her chosen lifestyle.|`|rAkWoweOaa	She will probably be able to care for them and move out with all the media proceeds. Thats all anyone can talk about.|`|mFZGIPcWaa	Honestly, without a father to help. I would commit myself to the farthest institution for a long time and sue the pants off the doctor who implanted all them.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	She's a disgrace.  she has no job, no house (of her own), she is 33 and lives off of her parents.  And she selfishly brings more innocent children into her bad situation.  all of these kids are forced to grow up with a pathetic irresponsible mother.    it makes me sick.  she's just a lazy loser who is looking for handouts from people who have compasion for her innocent children.  She ought to be in prison.  and so should that unethical doctor.
5rqVTOzmaa	Here's a short list of my favorites..  Alexander  Andrew  Christopher  Dylan  Noah  Riley  Scott  Trevor  Tyler  Warner    From there, I'd narrow it down to..  Alexander  Christopher  Riley  Trevor  Tyler  Warner    Ultimately, I'd choose..  Riley Alexander or Christopher Warner =)    You chose wonderful names!!|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Alexander (Alex)=1  Andrew=2  Austin=6  Charles (Charlie)=3  Chase=3  Christopher=0  Davis=0  Dylan=9  Edward (Teddy)=2  Kane=2  Noah=7  Oliver=0  Oscar=0  Riley=2  Robert (Robbie)=3  Scott (Scotty)=3  Sebastian=1  Stephen=0  Tanner=6  Todd=1  Trevor=1  Tyler (Ty)=3  Vance=0  Warner=0  Wilson=0  Winston=0  10 being the highest|`|xpUyH0psaa	dylan  edward  oliver  sebastian  wilson  are all good names.|`|m6hUZPlKaa	Sebastian!|`|tCnPhIhhaa	I like Noah & Tyler|`|1WslXGsQaa	none of those names are horrible, which is a good sign =]    my top five are:    1. Chase  2. Noah  3. Riley  4. Oliver  5. Alexander    hope this helps!|`|aE9MrLL0aa	If i narrow it down it would be like this    5-           Austin    Dylan     Noah     Riley        Trevor          Tyler  4-  Austin  Dylan  Noah  Riley  Trevor  3-  Austin  Dylan  Noah  Riley  2-  Austin  Dylan  Riley  1-  Austin  Dylan|`|Ya1zZORIaa	You have a great choice of names there! But these are my favs:  Austin (or you could spell it Austyn)  Chase  Davis  Kane  Riley  Scott  Tanner  Vance  Warner  -my cat's name is winston so I can't recommend that lol  Good luck!|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	i like Oliver|`|xLabGD6Maa	Alexander   Andrew  Charles   Christopher  Edward   Robert   Stephen|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I like nearly all of them, but my favorites are:    Alexander  Andrew  Charles  Dylan  Edward  Noah  Oliver  Sebastian|`|lGSUToFQaa	Trevor  Dylan  Sebastian|`|5DK546BUaa	Alexander (Alex) - I love this name! It is a nice strong, classic, masculine name... and it is very versatile with many possible nicknames... Plus, it could be handed down to a daughter or granddaugher with Alexandra (or various other versions)    Christopher - Another wonderful name! Chris is such a boy's name... and Christopher is just a wonderful sounding, classic name that will age well (some names are cute for a child, but I have a hard time imagining an adult or grandparent with them!)    Edward (Teddy) - Aside from the fact that this name might spike quite high in the next few years... I really love it... It is a name that will easily last the generations (I love the nickname Teddy, but am unsure how/if they are related...)    LEVI - Have you considered this? It seems to fit in with your list...    Noah - Not a bad name... short, sweet, and paired up correctly it is rather nice...    Oliver - This is another name that will last for generations... This one has a slightly more modern-yet-classic feel then Edward...    Scott (Scotty) - Short and sweet... but a thoroughly good, strong, masculine name...    Sebastian - One of my favorites! I love Sebastian Teague (meaning venerable poet)    Stephen - My father's name... I'm borderline on this, but it is overall a decent name...    Winston - This one would need the right middle name, but I think it could also work out rather nicely...      The rest of the names aren't bad... just nothing that I much care for...  HTH :-)|`|WfwlGbUAaa	I like the name Riley - but i prefer it as a girls name.    I like Oliver, it can be shortened to Ollie, which is cute (and my cousins name).    I like Tyler too. Lovely name.|`|MDTgUDnUaa	My favorites are Alex, Andrew (Drew), Austin, Davis, and Tyler.    What about Jensen, Dallas, Carson, or Easton. Those seem similar to your style too.|`|WVqoLROFaa	Alexander (Alex)  Andrew  Austin  Chase  Christopher  Dylan  Edward (Teddy)  Noah  Oliver  Robert (Robbie)  Scott (Scotty)  Stephen  Tanner  Trevor  Tyler (Ty)  Winston  tdfl|`|EtCkoHX5aa	Riley and Noah are my favorites!|`|QWTLw9DEaa	We have similar taste... Some of these are on my favorites. Here are my favorites of yours:  Austin  Alexander  Charles  Christopher  Edward - But not Teddy as a nickname, never for a boy. Eddie  Noah  Tyler  Wilson    Hard to choose from here...  Go with: Tyler or Charles, but I really don't like the nickname Ty for Tyler. If you cut out that nickname, then I'd go with Tyler

I also like Elise.
ocntNBqeaa	I am so tired of the Aden, Braden, Kaden, Jaden stuff!!!   it seems so over used, and i know several people who have named their kids one of those (or a variation of) and i cant stand them!    another thing is the rediculous spelling variations some ppl come up with. its so annoying, if you like a name then just spell it normally so people can actually pronounce it! LOL i mean yeah i like unique names, but i also want people to say my kids names!|`|0nWsfdd9aa	Sarah is mine.|`|bvWgHr5Qaa	I HATE names with a Y where there's not traditionally supposed to be, or a K where it's supposed to be a C.....       We are looking for a classic name too. or a saint name. read those baby name books, some are a hoot!  lol    Other than that, I HATE unisex names.  or names used by celebrities in general, lol.|`|2ptiHZheaa	Alex./Alexus  Jessica.  Ashley.  Amy.  Nicole/Nikki  Jamie.  Mitchelle  Sarah  Tamara    Lucas  Michael  Mitchell  Christopher      i would never call any of my kids these names.  i personally dont like them.|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	Hey forget you guys I like the name "Isabelle"! LOL      But yeah I too am sick of the "ayden" "jayden" "brayden" ect., type names|`|Ya1zZORIaa	I'm into unique names, so I don't prefer trendy or classic names. I dislike classic names much more than trendy names though; here are the ones I dispise the most:  Kate  Megan-ugh! so many of those!  Lauren/ Laura- my name is Laura; kinda hate it  Sarah- invading the world  Brittany/ Britney  Ashley  Tyler- so mainstream  Matthew  Travis  Kyle|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Trendy names:    Addison (This is the name of a disease! People must not know that when they name their children)  Madeline/Madelyn  Morgan  Jace (what?)  Madison  Hunter  Logan  Landon    Classic names:  Matthew  Noah  Jacob    Oh yes, adding Jayden to the list. Sorry! But I do have a Sarah - that name has managed to be popular for over a century!     Brianna is another one, or Bree/Brie, Brylie or any variation thereof that kind of reminds me of a cheese wheel.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	hmmm... Mikayla/Makayla/Mikaela (or any other spelling other than Michaela. i like Michaela), Tayla, Kayla, Madison, Addison (gag), Samantha, Kaylin, Nevaeh, Mackenzie.    Jayden, Aidan, Kayden, etc.     There aren't any classic names that drive me crazy, really. How can a  name like Elizabeth drive you crazy ? it's a classic :)|`|lGSUToFQaa	i gotta say i'm so tired of landon or london or brody, those are big in our area|`|dPULl5hjaa	Pathetic names that can't be pronounced, spelled differently, made up names, two middle names, hippie names, unique names, seasons of the year names, old ladies names, etc.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Anything rhyming with Jayden (Aiden, Caden....)    Jaxson (Anything with JAX - I mean if you want that name stop trying to "spice it up" and spell it Jack! It just looks stupid with the X)    Neveah, I feel so bad for the kids in twenty years that will have to change their names.|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	jessica  sarah  lauren  isabella  ^ way to many of those outt there!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	None, i may not like some names, and i just wouldn't use them cuz i don't like them, but there aren't any names, trendy or classic, that i'm sick of seein or that make my skin crawl.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	All of the ones you have listed.  I dont like unisex names.  And i dont like the name Ava (no offence to anyone) and ive seen it a lot lately.|`|wdXQaATDaa	I'm sick of seeing:    Bella  Isabella  Hayden  Peyton|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Isabelle or Isabella.  My number 1 hate is Nevaeh!  Yuck!  I am with you on the boys.  My opinion is you like what you like and if you want to name your child Brayden then more power to you!  The way I think of it is what is oh so unique today could be popular tomorrow.  I have loved the name Madison since junior high.  I am 30 so yeah that was a long time ago.  It has become super popular but if I have another daughter it will still be on my name list because I love it.|`|GZRHJBT7aa	Firstly, I completely agree with you on the destiny, hope, faith, and paris genres. And please, do not name your child Autumn or Winter.    Ok trendy names that annoy me..  Nicole! I actually know about 3424253 Nicoles/Nikkis.  Alex, Danielle, Sammi, Jessica, Emily, Emma. I don't even think they're nice names.    and omg Peyton? WTF.  Sage? It sounds like a poisonous plant or something. Might as well name your child Seed.    oh and Zoe/Zoey.. It's soo ugly, why would you name your kid that?|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	I'm sick of the names Olivia and Sophia/Sophie.... who ever decided these names were good had baaaad taste! lol YUCK!!    Not to mention the fact that they sound old lady-ish...|`|yXi3M5A3aa	I'm tired of seeing the names    Jessica  Jennifer  Ashley  Kayla  Laura  Elizabeth  Marie  Natalie  Rachel  Emily  Sara  Angela  Amanda  Lisa|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I've noticed a big trend in :  Ava  Riley  Isabella  Kaden  Jayden    It seems like so many people are naming their kids these now. I mean they're cute names, I'm just sick of hearing everyone use them.|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	I'm getting really sick of the names Caden, Jayden, Brayden, Hayden and Aiden..    They're everywhere!!|`|qLkknQx1aa	madison and landon|`|sljFp5aNaa	i agree with the one who said jaden.  i also dislike kaden or grayson or any name like that.  and destiny and serenity are rediculous names.|`|8Kn3vbwDaa	I sofa king we todd did
9Q2jwVSTaa	i got my periods really lightly when i was pregnant just once or twice so i didnt think i was pregnant turns out i was so you could be|`|HThwnbVtaa	yes it is possible when i had my first pregnancy i had a light bleed at the time my period was due only to find out days later i was in fact pregnant....best of luck|`|e8Jwbx4Daa	While it's always hopeful, highest chances are you aren't pregnant if you got your period. But like I said, I know women who have gotten short periods all throughout their pregnancy.    The best option for you now, if you REALLY are curious and want to know for sure, is to take a pregnancy test or get a blood test done at your doctor. There are some relatively cheap pregnancy tests at Wal-Mart and even Dollar Tree (yes, they actually work.)     Or you could buy from http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/    Good luck!|`|2I7mfeYOaa	Have you taken a test?  I had what I thought was a period but my doctor told me it was a "late implantation"- some women spot or bleed as the baby implants- or "settles in"- and can easily have a positive test a short time afterwords.  Test now, and follow up with your doctor- it could be pregnancy.
40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	According to "The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy" some women swear their body starts to change immediately and they just *know* even before the test comes back positive.  So it's definately possible - especially if the day you had unprotected sex was the same day that you ovulated.<br>  <br>  Probable, however, is a different question.  Most women don't experience any symptoms until nearly a month into the pregnancy.  I'm one of the few on the other end of the extreme who really hasn't felt any "symptoms" (except being more suceptible to colds - I've had three this winter - and the fact that my abdomen is growing) and I'm halfway along.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  In response to a number of other answers on this list, bear in mind that there is a difference between when one becomes pregnant and when on can prove one is pregnant.  Yes, it is too early to prove (by OTC tests, etc.) that you are pregnant, but that is not at all the same thing as being pregnant.  And if you are pregnant, then yes, you could have symptoms.<br>  <br>  Second, all women are different.  Very few of us have exact 28 day cycles to start with.  And within that cycle (whether it is 21 days or 35 days - also both possible), we undergo ovulation and LH surges at different times as well.  Some women ovulate "early" (a week after the previous period), some late (only a few days before the next period), but most ovulate somewhere around day 14.  Likewise, not everyone takes six days from fertilization to implantation.  That's an average.  So your period isn't due for another week yet.  That *necessarily* doesn't mean it's too early.<br>  <br>  Finally, all that said, your symptoms could also be the flu.  I had the flu once that coincided with my period and I felt exactly like you describe, with the addition of chills.  That's why in my original answer I made a distinction between "possible" and "probable."|`|wl7tlYOYaa	It would be too early for you to  be getting symptoms you  mignt be getting sick or just getting your period. Early pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are very similar. Wait for your period if it doesnt show take a test. Good luck.|`|WPI0Z47saa	No it is not possible. Your baby isn't even mae 6 days after sex. It takes up to 2 weeks for implantation to occur. You don't get symptoms until you are at the very least 3 weeks pregnant and that is usually just burning nipples. The rest come 4--6 weeks into pregnancy and sometimes later.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Some of you people are being silly. You DO NOT get pregnant immediately after having sex!|`|dg6wd8ufaa	It's possible you are since you had unprotected sex. But You will have to wait until your period is due. Maybe you could try a first response test. And then try again if  your period still isn't hasn't come. But congrats if your'e pregnant! It's the most wonderful experience|`|wNZ95AK3aa	yes could be possible|`|UiXJLrDWaa	ummm its all your head.|`|g8qHXXxtaa	Ok first of all - could everyone answering stop answering on what you 'Think' and not what you 'Know'.<br>  <br>  Anything is possible. Six days is enough to feel some symptoms. <br>  <br>  But to be honest it can be what is called as "Growing Up". Your body changes. You can feel sick when you do not eat. You can be feel fatigued and tired when you do not eat, You can feel bloated when your full and need excretion (poo). I think you may have issues with your stomach, not pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Make an appointment with your local GP and tell him your symptons, he will prescribe you with something and i'd bet my money it will do the trick or atleast i bet my money its not pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped and take care! x|`|jrdtQi04aa	I dont think most people feel anything that soon.  I did, but I didnt feel sick or anything.  I felt something weird inside.  It was just a very strange feeling.  It was a strange, little bit of tingly things going on. A little uncomfortable.  Just a little off.  When my period didnt come, I wasnt surprised.  I kind of just knew.  Second time the same thing.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Some women (in rare cases) have symptoms early, but nausea, increased appetite and bloating don't usually come until you are 4 weeks pregnant. It is common to feel sleepy and have mild cramps early.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	well pregnancy is taken from first day of last period not the actual intercourse so if your period was beggining of last month then you would be about 3 weeks preggars now (if you are) and some people get symptoms from this time.|`|c9a33ded6139d91d15c7b135a9b4da6caa	Rubbish - most of my friend have had this bug around Glasgow - these symptoms in pregnancy don't start until around 6 weeks, it takes 5 days after conception until the embryo settles into the womb.|`|3EiOobEVaa	It is way to early to know if you are pregnant or not. You need to wait until after your first cycle is due to take a preganancy test.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No it's too early!|`|DBrNaYNyaa	take a test for bes results..we dont have the answer..your pee does!!!|`|P31J6x2oaa	To be honest.. you can get symtoms early on as soon as conception has taken place and the egg has fertilised in the uterus. Sometimes, most commonly than not, you are thinking you are because you are thinking too much about it and the symptoms of pregnancy etc... I would wait and see if you get your period early next month and if it is late... do a test hun. <br>  You could be pregnant, the symptoms sound as though you could well be however some of the symptoms are also consistent with symptoms you get before coming on your period.<br>  Good luck, I hope things turn out ok for you whatever the outcome. xx|`|fZGBjtpVaa	You can get symptons at any time.  Pregnancy starts from the first day of your LMP.<br>  So sounds as though you're about 4 weeks pregnant.<br>  I was getting symptoms at 4 weeks, I was feeling sick, I was always hungry, and all I could smell was soil.  Not to mention the bad tiredness!<br>  <br>  Every pregnancy is different, and every woman has different symptoms for it.  Some people don't even know that they're pregnant and they turn out to be about 4 months!|`|VJRqSueSaa	STOP having unprotected sex for a start, unless u want a child ,with some 1 u love ,who wants a child  too. Your symptoms may be down 2 worrying about being pregnant. Best see your doctor and find out 4 shure. Hope things turn out the way u want them 2 . Good luck|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	yes it is possible, esp if you are going to be very receptive of the symptoms. but you can also be creating these symptoms in your head and your body is beginning to believe you. but wait a little while and take a test!|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Wait for your period dates<br>  After a week or 10 days you can go for a test to confirm pregnancy<br>  If you feel that you might be pregnant then take precaution from now on and try to conceive it safely<br>  <br>  Enjoy|`|4GwTDea1aa	Its too early for symptoms, epsecialy if you havnt even missed your period yet, its probably just because yor stressing about it! Sometimes your mind tricks your body!|`|KtmbnW4Naa	your pregnant.... why did you have unprotected sex? i dont now if you wanted to but it sounds like you dont so yeah your pregnant|`|Rhr1umV1aa	It is possible to have symptoms as soon as a few days. I would say just wait it out until you miss your period. Then call your GYNO|`|hNIof0lbaa	Your psyching yourself out!!! Just wait for your period to come  & if it doesnt...then its time to worry!!! Wrap his willy up next time!|`|gh7r2PKGaa	it could be those pre-menstrual symptoms!<br>  i have them all the time..., but idk about the throwing up part :/|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	Wayyy too early. Wait til you miss your period, you'll know.|`|UbnhjZmjaa	yew may be Pregnat|`|TqPiy9gLaa	no its unlikely but i would get checked for stds if i where you!!
GAj9hwWvaa	Yes, I think it's beautiful. I would probably do Marcheline Victoria.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	No I wouldn't.  Choose another middle name.  Something simple like Liv just not Liv.  Marcheline Marie, Marcheline Ann, Marcheline Corrine.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Ummm.. how is the first name pronounced????|`|QEEweJUaaa	No.|`|Gge8MNTKaa	Marcheline Alexandria... it has to be something as exotic as the first.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	I don't think so. When I have a baby girl someday I'm naming her Sarah Rose.|`|foTSL4vjaa	I don't know how exactly how to say that name but Marcheline May would would sound a bit better.|`|UXoTCL98aa	Marcheline is cute but not what id name my daughter    liv doesnt really flow that well with it but if you really wanted to keep the Liv you could do Marcheline Livy or Livie or olivia  Marcheline Rose  Marcheline Grace  Marcheline Emma
n6XYYyoLaa	yes, maybe hard, but doable; just keep your chin up, it gets easier...i promise; and when your baby is a little older and more animated, you will know what it was all about...|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	No, but I a single mom to a 6 month old and have been ever since she was born.  Yes it's possible.  I get a "break" to run to the grocery store or something once in a while when my mother or grandmother comes over.  It's really not that bad at all.  =)|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I don't fit your requirements, but I can guarantee you that being a single mother is completely possible.  You'll have to work hard, but you can do it.  Hundreds of thousands of other women do it everyday.|`|fIUr49ujaa	When I had my oldest I was alone for a long while.  It is hard but possible.

Because of his addiction I have gotten NO help at all with the house, kids, or bills for half a year.  So i am left to take care of everything by myself.

miFe45quaa	Violet Genevieve Kirkbride is absolutely stunning.  I love it and it flows amazingly well!    I think Vivienne and Genevieve look too similar paired up together (as sister they are nice though). Too many V's and E's.   And Regan is horribly masculine on a girl.    The others just don't flow well with Genevieve.   Violet is beautiful and goes great with Genevieve.  Congrats!|`|9f9160e22080d1c41de3d818930f6222aa	Audrey!|`|d01EV6npaa	i actually like lily genevieve kirkbride. thats beautiful. violets nice also. or kara genevieve.|`|AA11735792	I like all of these.

ArDBlPKYaa	haha - I thought the same thing when I was trying to pick out a name for my son.  I guess because you're picking them name while s/he's a baby?   Also, "names" just doesn't sound as cute and exciting as "baby names."|`|HrcuGjUHaa	because they ARE baby names.|`|Ir0dKh3iaa	i totally agree|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	who cares?|`|J2gr1ogHaa	bc the word names is used to name other things. Like rock bands plants dog breeds...etc|`|IwvOKjfcaa	Because when people ask a question, normally they are asking about naming a *gasp* BABY!|`|UtzkaqPaaa	I agree but the baby names books wouldn't be so appealing to new parents.

I love it. (:    Worst: I want to say Sushi & Polly.  Polly: Polly Pocket. Enough said.  Sushi: ....It's a little....peculiar.    Boys:  Best: Leo  It means lion and its a very cute nickname and real name. It can also grow up along with the child himself.    Worst: Boor  It's way to close to the word boar, which means, basically, a hog. Now, that doesn't scream grateful and a sweet person to me.    *That doesn't mean I'm fond of the other odd names though. I mean Loosha? It sounds like lose-ya if you say ten times fast.  Kiya is alright.  Phan is basically pronounced: fan.  Kurman? Sounds like a crabby old doorman who's man is Kurt so they combined doorman and Kurt to make Kurman.  Hurlly? It sounds like a toddler trying to explain they are about to throw up.  Liam is alright.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	Gosh -they are all gruesome apart from Liam    the rest just sounds like random and silly, double meaning words,|`|hHoU5GKAaa	best-polly and liam  worst-sushi and boor  why-its obvious|`|zOecdrJaaa	Polly worst- sounds kind of old fashioned.  Kyra best- Ok im bias, its my mates name, but its unusual but not in a weird way    Phan worst. I can't even pronouce it.  Leo- best. lion like. strong and such ^^|`|79ce4d703faa2590296f531b347745c8aa	To be honest they are all pretty bad however Kiya is pretty nice and not all that popular so id go for that :)
6yYeCVQFaa	I feel your pain about not sleeping during pregnancy as I am pregnant as well. Any pregnant woman knows to cherish those nights. LOL Get the rest you need and try not to over do it. That feeling is certainly what is referred to as nesting. Nesting is the urge to make everything perfect before your little bundle of joy comes into the world. It doesn't give you energy, though I wish it did. LOL|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	I would say you're nesting.  I dont know if you're supposed to get a surge or energy or a surge of 'i've got to get this done!!' feeling! I am also extremely exhausted and being on my feet kills!! I've changed so much with this pregnancy! I used to be able to tolerate a little bit of a mess at the office and at home. I'd just let the dust sit a couple extra days, let the kitchen be dirty, clothes go unwashed for a while - but within the last couple weeks I have completely changed! I can't handle messes, things sitting around, and "chores" not being done!! Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!!|`|ioZeveazaa	Yeah you are nesting. I get it to. I cleaned out the fridge last night at 8pm.....=/. It looks nice but its weird. I also have been cleaning everything I can get my hands on. lol Good luck!|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	I thought I was nesting last week at 37.5 weeks but I guess not! I read that it's pretty common for women late in there pregnancy to get multiple spurts of energy or even be more exhausted. When you do get the real nesting instinct and feel like you are a bit anxious and jittery then conserve your energy. It could mean that labor is near and this burst of energy is supposed to help you get through labor. So don't waste it! :)|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	I've always heard that right before a woman goes into labor she has a huge burst of energy and wants to get everything done. At 38 weeks that may be your situation too. Take a basket with you just in case. 
3EhoJ42zaa	Well if she is using words like "academical" orasking a question like "gave me your opinion," then I would say she does not have a degree.  I would think she made it to 7th grade then dropped out.|`|E1wGuCavaa	Beauty school drop out...beauty school drop out...go back to high school.|`|ftWsPGNfaa	4 year college degree?|`|MDTgUDnUaa	My friend Ashley has her Bachelors and a Masters.|`|rqK5ya57aa	I see an Ashley with a bachelor's degree in business management or fashion design. For some reason I just see Ashley managing a Charlotte Russe-but maybe she can have her own boutique.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	my friend ashley is a DENTAL NURSE :)    A LEVEL UK|`|FVFxE6owaa	Hopefully one that's higher than yours.  Academical is not a word.|`|nXzt7bm6aa	Based upon your use of "academical" I would suspect that Ashley may get a diploma from an unaccredited school advertising job preparation courses including certificates in child care, dental assisting and doll repair. These kinds of schools generally advertise in magazines and tabloids.|`|VrjF986Aaa	academical?  by that alone I would say a GED at best|`|xLabGD6Maa	None.  Cosmetology certificate.
MHOxPs8Oaa	So find somebody else to watch him. You have to take the test. Oh and what a ***** for not even telling the dad his kid was born. I hate girls that do this.|`|TQW5E6olaa	No way around it, if you have to take the test, you need to have someone watch him for that period of time.... So, ask the proff if you can change the date and time of the test to a time and date where someone can go with you or when someone is available to watch him. <br>  <br>  Aren't you technically on disability since your 3 weeks out???? Contact the dean (pray its a woman with children) and plead your case...delay the test for 3 more weeks if possible and schedule someone to be home with him... How can you go to school if you're "disabled" ...|`|AjqO1aJgaa	How long does the test take? Any chance you can ask someone else who does the class to mind baby for you while you take it? (any other parents in your class, or mature students?) If it's only an hour and your stepdad is free, have him come with you and take him for a walk at the campus while you do the test. If you feed him before you start, he won't need feeding again until you are finished.<br>  <br>  It's a problem. What made you think it wouldn't be?|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I'd say now is the perfect time for dad to start learning how to 'handle' him. He is the baby's parent, too. What other choice do you have?<br>  <br>  ETA: Ok, I get it. By daddy I thought you meant the baby's father. Sorry. Can your dad help you by taking him with you on campus and waiting for you somewhere nearby? Feed him, change him, then walk him around in the stroller for awhile so he can *hopefully* sleep?|`|miPubuDYaa	Most colleges have daycares for these situations.<br>  <br>  My former college charges $2.00 an hour to babysit but you had to have proof you are in class. Note from teacher or schedule.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	here's what I suggest.. you find someone.. even a friend of your sisters or a sister of your friend.. someone you have SOME idea about and you have them come with you and sit outside the classroom with jamie.  try to have jamie sleep - extra feeding or whatever you need to do.  pay them of course and you can check on them periodically.  if you have no one, ask the day care there if they have an employee who is willing to do it either during their break/lunch hour or before/after their shift or if they aren't scheduled to work.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: i disagree with having your sister take off school or your mom off work - he's your child and you need to be responsible.  its nice when people offer to help, but it is your full responsibility not theirs.  and i speak from experience on that.   <br>  there were some good points about school admin having to give you the option of taking the test alone so you can have jamie with you - go that route and INSIST they do that for you|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	At three weeks baby cannot be separated from you if you are nursing, IMO.  Why do you HAVE to take the test?  Can it wait?  Baby always comes first IMO...<br>  <br>  Also, why can't baby come with, if he's sleeping in a sling you can absolutely take a test.  Are there going to be other students in the room?  Maybe your teacher could arrange for you to be in a room by yourself so if Jamie wakes up he won't disturb everyone else.|`|aJjV5b95aa	See if you mom will let you younger sister miss a day of school. There really is no other choice. Unless she takes off or you ask you step dad to watch him and have him help you until next week so he can get some practice.|`|RGOgb856aa	Why don't you get your sister to take a day off school? One day shouldn't hurt, and it doesn't sound like you have a lot of options.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	any more relatives that can take him?? or you can ask a friend.|`|ac89nvFgaa	Daddy can't handle him?<br>  Why not?|`|AA10730513	Can't ask your mom or just really really don't want to? You have gone too far to skip this test. (which I am sure you know) And it is not something that will happen on a regular basis. You just need to finish up this set of classes then you can take a break if it's so inconvenient for others to watch your son at this age. <br>  <br>  If your mom can't do it, what about that guy you mentioned before? Does he have to work, or can he take a day off and sit somewhere with Jamie while you take the test? ... I assumed you have checked to make sure the campus doesn't have anyone that can watch him for a little while. (I know it would be hard to leave him with a stranger while you test. But some campuses do have daycares on them that might be able to help with this 1-time thing.)<br>  <br>  For future references, some online schools do not make you come in to take tests. They are expensive, but I chose one that didn't make me come in because I knew it would be near impossible for me to find someone to watch Cheyenne.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i would go to someone "ahead" of your teacer,there has to be someone who can give you more of an option....i agree with the girl below that suggested maybe asking a friend of your sister or even friend of your mom maybe?...do you have any neighbors you would trust?...for last resort...see if you could pick up your sister early from school,maybe she could wait in car with him,or watch him,,how much could she miss ina half a day?.......also to <3...she said she hates it when girls do that?....i hate it when people run there mouth and dont know everything......... you have done the right thing with jamie...if the father cared he would of called by now to see if you have delivered.......good luck ,i hope you find a resolution....im a stay at home mom and would watch him in a minute if i could!|`|yaCnyhgxaa	How long is the test going to take you.  Usually tests do not take more than an hour or so.  If you feed the baby right before you go in the computer lab, change him and he goes to sleep, could your step dad watch him for an hour or so in the car or walk around campus with him in a stroller.  He would be able to stay close by so that as soon as the test was over he could meet you with the baby.  I know he has never been around babies but in a situation like this it seems like he might be your best bet for a little while.|`|yC9cTgDkaa	Do you have any "drop-in" daycare services in your area?  You may wanna give that a try.  look it up in the yellow pages, or you can always try the trusty Craigslist. I'm sure you'll find help there, but you may wanna question the quality of help, lol!|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	you are going to have to ask a friend or someone to watch him! and just deal with the hour difference! if you NEED to take this test then you NEED to do what you need to do!|`|kU48K7ugaa	Consider adoption.|`|6zuoRhFvaa	talk to your school officials. they have to provide options for you, such as possibly taking the test privately. the only reason they dont want the baby there is because she might distract the other students, which im sure you figured out. <br>  <br>  if you talk to your school administrators and tell them you need to take the test privately because you don't have child care options and you have a newborn, i think they will be willing to work with you. stay strong and stubborn about it and they will head your requests. <br>  <br>  you have rights as a student mother. just remember that.|`|hNIof0lbaa	I wish I lived by you, Id watch him for ya! Maybe your mom can take just a half day or something of the sort? Do you have any friends that could possibly just take him for the short time.... I know your def uncomfortable with him being just 3 weeks, but Im sure if you know someone trustworthy (a friend) he'll be fine! Otherwise, do you know of a daycare center that can take him for a few hours? Maybe go check a few out and see how he reacts to the people there...!  Ps, he is sooo adorable :)
AbyFzocYaa	your too young for a baby. please stop trying. if n\you want a baby get a pet or doll baby.|`|gZ5m3o96aa	you are way to young! you shouldnt even be thinking about babies at that age.|`|CZwJJetyaa	A child now is a big mistake. Once you have a baby you can't undo it. A child is FOREVER! And a very big responsibility.  Go to school, enjoy your youth.   And buy condoms.  You have your whole life to be a mother but just a few short years to be young. Enjoy your youth!|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Oh hun, if you are sixteen and you already have two children why would you want to have another one so soon.  You are already weighed down by the stress of trying to finish high school and caring for your two children.  I suggest taking some time to just live your life and enjoy the two children you have.  You have all the time in the world to have children.  If you wait a few years it isn't going to lessen your chance of conceiving or even lessen your chance of having a boy. Please listen to some of the people responding. The ones that are leaving nice comments have your best interest in mind. They aren't tying to judge, just trying to help you to understand your decisions.|`|8lchebCNaa	thats the age ii git pregnant with my first.. its hard work u should realy think this over.... and u never know if the daddy will be around theses days! im very luck to have mine stll!  ps u are not guaranteed a boy! and u dont have a say so when it comes to that and u would know that if u were mature enough to have child!|`|Crdbwmo7aa	16 is too young...  although i got pregnant with my first at 17...i do NOT recommend young girls gettin pregnant. alot is taken from you.. you have to grow up quicker than you think..live your teen years while you can sweety.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	Uh, yeah. Sixteen year-olds are not supposed to be having children, they should be in school, casually dating. then they go to college, settle down, THEN make babies. Who taught you these things?
3cLE5L7Saa	If Jordyn were to stay with her mother, would it be a bad environment?  This is what I would ask myself.  I know you have a lot on your plate already, and that is really rude of your sis to push this on you, but do you think it would be best for jordyn, and even though it might be hard??  How come your bro wouldn't take Jordyn?  Is she a trouble maker?  This is what family is for though.  Would your sis be sending you money to help take care of Jordyn?  She should.  Its a really tough decision.  I would probably take Jordyn and do the best I could.  Thats how my heart rolls :)  Good luck.|`|DN9RZHi3aa	you should take jordyn in  i know you have so many things to do, but take in jordyn, so she has a loving enviornment to stay in  talk to your sister about how you feel too  she needs to understand the situation you are in and that you are being overwhelmed|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	my aunt tried to send my 14 yr old cousin to my mom. my mom has 3 kids living at home-one of whom is autistic, she just said no he went into care but it is actually the best thing thats happened to him. he is growinng up, he gets the attention he deserves and he is still allowed to come visit and even stay oversommetimes. your sister shouldnt have had kids if shes going to dump them on you i dont care what the situation is and yes i say the same of my aunt|`|nlNNmBbRaa	obviously your in a bit of a tricky situation here. considering shes 14, unless shes one of those really rebellious and trouble making teenagers then she shouldnt be too much trouble. if she didnt come to stay with you, what would happen to her? she may be in a negative and unsupportive environment, so id let her come to stay with you.   if after a while it is becoming too much to have her there, you could always try to think of an alternative.|`|InVNGragaa	Well if you don't take her in, who will? You say she might feel neglected and unloved, but if you don't let her in, won't you be the same as all the rest? Things have to get worse before they get better, and for Jordyn this may be the thing that gets better for her. And who knows, she might help you with all the things that you need, like helping with the nursery or even with your other children. I can understand how Jordyn might feel because I've been there before. My mother gave me away when I was 5. And shortly after taken to a mental hospital. So I'm suspecting I can understand how Jordyn's feeling right now.|`|gILygKvRaa	take her in
1jwbQaZTaa	this is a really hard situation and im sorry you have to go through this. as a male, he doesnt understand the bond between parent and child, especially because he knows that this child was not made by him. to be honest, if he cant understand just by seeing how much you love that baby, then he may not ever understand. things may change after you have the baby, he may want to keep it and just fall in love with it like its his own. it was not your fault you were raped and its not like you cheated on him. good luck :D|`|wcYRxDw2aa	Well do explain to him that this innocent baby did nothing wrong, and as bad as it hurts what happened it deserves a to have great life away from the pain.  It's not like you want to keep the baby and the two of you raise it with that rapist coming over every other weekend to see it.  Explain to him that the baby is a part of you and that you deserve to be happy.  He might be one of the men in the world that think that you guys did it on purpose.  Just let him know how you feel it may take him a while to come to terms with it, but if he loves you as much as you love him then he will and the two of you will be back to normal again.  Good luck!|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	you are brave. i dont thinnk i could go through with this. well done. explaain to your bf tthat it means nowt about your ex you just cant bring your self to kill a child(use those words!) and he still means the world to you. maybe you could see slighy less of each othe  untill the baby has "gine away" so as not to rub his nose in it... for your sak i hope some one has got a better answer cause i been at work all night an dont evn know if this is making sense!|`|b6LcC0CEaa	I think he might be upset because you say you "love this child"... you have to remember that you are giving up your rights to it as soon as its born. Maybe he's afraid you are getting too attached to it already, and won't be able to give it up later.|`|23fDrmZoaa	If he truly loved you he would understand and accept the fact that you do not want to take away an innocent life. I think you need to have a talk with him and let him know that if he cannot accept the fact that you are doing wht you feel is right then he isnt the one for you. Stress isnt good for you or the baby and your boyfriend needs to be there for you he is an idiot if he thinks you arent going to love the baby. Pregnancy is a bong that is very strong and the love is something that will never go away and he needs to see that. Hope everything works out!!|`|F9Z1IaRyaa	This is a difficult decision for you as well as for him and explain to him that you know how difficult it must for him to understand.   But explain to him this a human being that has 50% of you and your blood.  That having this baby does not mean you care about the ex-creep.  Tell him that your concience as a human being does not allow you to abort the child.  If your present boyfriend or anyone tries to convince you to do something inhumane such as "killing" another human being, let alone your own flesh and blood, do you think he really loves you?  Showing little interest of the life of another human being, may give you a hint of the kind of person he is and you may want to think twice if you want to live with that kind of person for the rest of your life.   I think you should speak to someone you can trust that could help you in this difficult time, as right now you can't possibly think straight.  Meanwhile, did you go to the State Attorney's Office in your area and report this rape?   Doesn't matter how much time has passed by, please report the creep for your sake and other women, too.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	not really he just either will get over it or wont but i think you are doing the right thing not that it means anything to you but you seem to be strong if you are willing to do that for the baby and how lucky that family will feel to have a new baby when they cant have one|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Well getting an abortion is like killing someone. You should keep the baby and give him/her their own home and let him/her grow up and live their life. And even though  your ex is the father, that baby is still your child so of course you love that baby. How can somebody not love their own child? Try to explain this to your boyfriend and tell him that you really do love him, and you love the baby too. And the baby is a person who deserves to live. If he really loves you, he will understand even if it is hard for him.

Emily Deborah is nice enough, but Emily is such a common name. Something like Emilia or Emmaline might be nice. Nora Catherine is lovely, and though Jane Elisabeth is nice, I think Elisabeth Jane has a better sound. The same goes for Claire Elisabeth -- Elisabeth Claire. Charlotte Rose is gorgeous. As is Amelia Kate.|`|qGQCLFinaa	I'm not to fond of most of them (sorry! just not for me)  But my choices for a boy & girl would be......

The thing with getting your tongue pierced is it can be kind of dangerous. Infection can happen very easily in your mouth. Another down side to a tongue piercing is it will never fully close after you take it out... so do you really want to be 60 years old with a hole in your tongue?? But I guess some girls find it attractive and some don't....|`|DN9RZHi3aa	i hate facial piercings or tongue piercings  dont do it  when your making out the girls tongue could get stuck, itll suck after a while|`|njppcqO8aa	no. they look incredibly stupid on everyone. ew.|`|0ACbEEywaa	Hmmm Idk...I think it just depends on the person. Maybe it would look good on you. As a chick I personally think it's hot. I'm planning on getting my tongue pierced this summer. And I can't wait.

1bnhwGACaa	depends on the baby <br>  my little monkeys heartbeat has been 135-150 so it varies <br>  i had 2 cyst they have both dissipated <br>  congrats and good luck hearing the heartbeat is awesome and amazing|`|Yl79igD7aa	It's not really about the heartbeat increasing as time goes by.  Normal fetal heart rhythms are between 110 and 160/minute.  So your baby's heartbeat will vary every time you hear it.  My little one is usually between 150-160 but it jumps around.  The very first time we heard it, it was about 160.  So it won't get faster with time, it'll just jump around within the above range.  Have fun!  :)|`|AA11542929	the heartrate depends only is high when the baby is more active, my baby heartrate jumps alot.. one month it was 130 the next it was 149 and then just last month it was 119 at my 30 week check up.. im now 35 weeks and 5 days pregnant and it prolly jumps from around there.. so the heartrate is okay.. the baby has its moments when it wants to be lazy or active.. congrats.. and bout the cyst i dont know nothing bout them.. sorry hun..|`|4YKu8PSJaa	according to studies,the fetal heart rate goes upto175 around the 10th wk,,,then gradually falls n almost plateaus at around 150 by term..<br>  there will be accelerations n decelerations in btn,,they can be both physiological n pathological..its slightly less wen the fetus s asleep,it goes up with movement,or uterine contraction..<br>   about the cyst,theoritically speaking,it shouldn't be a problem,so,don worry..|`|Rhr1umV1aa	As far as the heartbeat goes, my doctor says that as long as the heartbeat is over 110 beats it is normal. There is no telling what it will increase. All depends on the baby. Every baby and pregnancy is different.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Awww, baby bean!!!  I'm not sure about the cysts, but I wanted to comment on the ultrasound and heartbeat.  That's a perfect heartbeat.  I bet you are over the moon!  Wait till your baby is wriggling all over the place on ultrasound and you can see arms and hands and feet and everything.  It's so cool!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	well at 6 weeks 3 days the heartbeat hadnt been beating very long so its normal for it to have been low but as the weeks progress it will get higher in like a week itll be like at 130 or 140 as so on then later on it will start to decrease. Cyst usually do go away on their own I dont have personal experience with it but ive read plenty on that.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	The heartrate should increase with each passing month, it is usually very fast in the third-fourth month at 150-160 bmp. By the time they reach the sixth-seventh month it should slow down to about 140-150bmp. As they near the end the rate drops lower, but as long as it's over 110bmp that's normal. My SIL had a cyst on an ovary while pregnant, the cyst was actually attached to her bladder also. It did go away on it's own.|`|v3LnJycKaa	umm not too much but depends baby may have been resting or not as active at that point, the first ultrasound i was 154, then 136, then 147, then 167 (30 minutes after the 147 one :) )|`|tmh42R6Caa	I don't know how much the HB raises by the day, but I think it will get up as high as 140 or so.

ENANtueuaa	Purple duckie - What in the world does fiber have to do with respecting toys...LOL    Anyway...I would take them away when you catch her starting to destroy her toys. Tell her 'if you can't play with it the right way, then you can't play with it at all." Don't give it back to her for a few days. Repeat the process until she gets the point, and she eventually will, don't worry! When she complains that she's running out of things to play with, tell her if she can play with them the right way you'll give them back. If you catch her doing it again, jsut keep repeating the process. As for your things, i would put her on a time out. If she's climbing on things to reach things that she knows she shouldn't be touching, then i'd put her in her room on a time out. After, you can explain why she can't do that, etc.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Don't give her many things at a time.|`|AA11210211	Take her toys away for a few days and explain to her why you did,maybe she will then realize that she needs to take care of her things otherwise she won't have them.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	My parents used to take away things they saw me treating badly.  And if I broke something I liked, you can be it wasn't getting replaced any time soon.  It's hard when they're that young, though...I'd say try getting her some toys that are meant to be taken apart and put back together again.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	ok...here's the scoop she has too much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and none of it has any value.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...stop buying !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and this means everything until this problem is solved...honestly it could take several months and that means no giving in..the rewards here will be huge..next..everything and anything she breaks i would not replace it and i would throw broken items away....i would talk a wee bit on this topic..." We will have no toys if we don't take care of them.."..and i would say "Broken toys are trash"....next...and really all of this is happening at the same time...she needs to have her room organized and a place for everything...and (no toy boxes they teach kids to throw everything into a pile)..she will have very little so..shelves with photos and a place for everything that she puts away...she is a part of the clean up, making the bed and putting item away where they go and she needs a role model with a positive attitude...she may even need someone to show her how to play with her toys...and then put them away...I would say my biggest problem at that age was stepping on toys left on the floor and them getting broken...so we created shelves and toy zones in the house where these items could be left...Once she has very little to play with or put away then role modeling how to play and put away should not be a huge task...now the hard part of this is not buying a toy, trinket, or treasure anytime you go out until she gets the idea about taking care of things...and ...when you say no...you can say you're learning how to care for your things..."One day when you show me how you care for your toys we will get it"...now i think it is up to you to be firm on no more stuff...now if a birthday is close...i would gather but no gifts..no more stuff,,,it's too much and has no value...everyone invited needs to bring a birthday hug for the little girl...ok now when she does get  a new little somethig when you notice some changes...then she is to take care of it..DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT PICKING THAT TOY UP!!!..YOU CALL HER  AND HAVE HER DO IT!!...and when you get the item create a spot for it together...another part of this is when laundry is done she could also help with that put away process....it's slow it will take time and work and just so i cover all the bases ..if this is not effective say within the first 9 days...then i would get a time out chair and spot and everytime she broke something i would....sit her on it..and before she gets up i would ask why she is sitting their...ok good luck email me if you have  more concerns...|`|rFtKFp03aa	Take away her toys.. this worked great for me.. Every time she threw something, used it improperly (she knows what right is wrong), abused it,  colored on it.. we took it away.. she doesn't do any of that now..     to get her to clean up I set a timer, whatever is on the floor is now mine..|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I wouldn't do much about her own things, but she must respect your things. Punish her if she destroys your stuff.|`|Daoa7x9Laa	I have a three year old and hes the same, i have told him time again that he should take more care of things but to be honest some of the time he doesnt mean to do it hes still learning, gradually when they will learn that things break if not treated properly, we tell him that it was naughty and you shouldnt touch things that dont belong to him and hes gradually learning but 3 year olds are very curious and will experiment things to their max i.e breaking them etc.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	3 minutes time out works great. I would also not buy her anything else until she can treat her things properly- Get a Bearenstain Bears book from the library about respecting toys- I know they have one. Show her the proper way to treat things and show her how they are tore up the way she treats them  My 2 1/2 year old did this with books for a while- even her favorite books!! It boggled my mind. Personally I would spank her butt when she tore a book up after she knew that was wrong- but thats our parenting style. We also do time out- 2 minutes for her. And she is getting better. She hasnt ripped up a book in months.|`|9FjkYgQgaa	the yogurts they have with the fiber in them. if you pick the right flavor your kid will love it and they are unknowingly getting the recommended amount of fiber.... its great|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Well let her do what she wants with her own things - but don't buy her anything new. If she asks for a new toy - explain to her she can't have it because she's always breaking the ones she has. Any gift she gets, is put away - until she can treat what she already owns with respect.    As for your things - every time she breaks something - punish her for it - by either putting her on the naughty step/stool/corner/mat or by confiscating one of her unbroked and favourite toys.

kO65JfS8aa	My daughter is also a screamer with too much energy! Remember it's just a phase - trying to assert her independnce.   Sometimes I can laugh her out of it if its something silly she is crying over, by tickling  her or putting something funny on my head.  When I pick her up, if she screams I put her down and tell her 'don't scream when you're on my lap' and I just let her cry it out (this can take AGES) and when she is not screaming I pick her up again.  If she is really worked up I stand outside with her to cool off and look at the people and traffic on the bridge.  Good luck.|`|JyCkXM8laa	my twin girsl will turn 3 soon and i also noticed that they started to move a lot in the house, fight a lot, throw things a lot and say no to me too and sometimes it upset  me that i have to put them on a time out and if they fight i make sure they do say sorry to each other, but whew it was really a very handful task but well its part of being a parent and them growing up actively...goodluck to all of us here with toddlers...|`|PlmT4lHXaa	smack|`|U3qTwOOIaa	e numbers and fizzy pop probably|`|xOr67VDiaa	I had the same problem with my 3rd child, she is 2 now and she was the most perfect baby. never really cried about anything, was so peaceful and now she is turning into a wild child, god i dont even know what happened it flashed b4 my eyes. when she carries on i just ignore her, then she will start crying and want some love from mummy.

I had such a hard time not getting angry no matter what I tried she would resist.|`|9fnmHVEDaa	The child when she reach 2 years old always like that.  Be calm, she need your attention. I do my research this what I found out from The University of Michigan Health System.    How can I change my child's problem behaviors?    If there are lots of behaviors you want to change, start by focusing on one or two of the most bothersome or dangerous ones. Don't try to make too many changes all at once.   Let your child make some decisions by giving them acceptable choices.  For example, ask, Do you want cereal or toast for breakfast today? or let them choose between the red or blue pants.    Make sure you have realistic expectations for your toddlers behavior.  Teaching toddlers good behavior is handled a little differently from school-age kids.    Have a few positively stated rules, and explain the reasons behind them.     Make sure your child understands the results of breaking the rules.    Use natural and logical consequences for problem behavior. The purpose here is to get kids to make the right decision, not to bend them to your will. Be patient-it may take time for you to see results.   Be firm and kind. Follow through on the natural and logical consequences.  Consequences are best if they are immediate and consistent.   Catch your child being good, and tell them you noticed.     Use descriptive praise.  For example, describe what you see:  Wow, this room is so neat.  I see all the toys put away, and no one even had to remind you!, rather than evaluating with praise like Youre a good boy; good job cleaning up!   Find out more about positive encouragement of good behavior, sometimes called Time-In or, in Spanish, Tiempo con Sus Hijos.   Redirect your child and help them find a better place, or safer way to do what they are trying to do. For example, if they want to write on the walls with crayons, give them a big sheet of paper or go outside and let them color on the sidewalk with chalk.    Remove your child from the cause of the problem behavior, or remove the cause of the problem from the child (for example by childproofing your house).   Learn how temperament affects kids behavior.  If you know your childs temperament, you can help them relate better in the world, and be sensitive in how you respond to them.  This understanding can help improve behavior.   For a wealth of information on discipline and helping kids behave, see YourChild:  Parenting Resources.   When should I get help with my childs behavior problems?  You should talk to your pediatrician about a referral to a professional if your child is doing things that are dangerous, harmful, or disrespectful to people or property.  If you see changes in your childs behavior or physical symptoms, like headaches or trouble with eating or sleeping, get help.  Your child may have a behavior disorder, and need help.  Problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder require treatment by a health care professional.           Where can I get more information?    Here are some Web sites that can help you find out more:    Interventions for Chronic Behavior Problems is research brief from the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY).  It covers behavior problems in kids with and without disabilities.    About DisciplineHelping Children Develop Self-Control   Behavior Problems at School is a compilation of resource material aimed at educators.|`|56E1DPHPaa	erccca ur the 1 that needs a smack.......|`|gBEzyNXXaa	She's independent. Help her with her independence. If you ask her to go to bed, and she screams, ask her what she would like to do before bed. Ask her what she wants to do, where she wants to go, if she needs help with anything, etc...  Also, check what she is eating. Make sure it's not to processed, or containing too much sugar (check the ingredients). You can usually cut back on that type of behavior by cutting out some of the processed foods (cereal, jelly, juice, and ketchup have a lot of sugar). Cut out all high fructose corn syrup.  Set boundaries, and don't give in to her when she screams. Make sure that if you tell her something that you carry out with it. If you tell her that if she screams, you'll turn the light off - if she screams, turn the light off, don't retell her that you're going to. Carry through with anything you tell her. Same for rewards, if you tell her that if she can go to bed without screaming that you'll take her to Grandma's on Sunday, make sure you write down on the Calender and actually do go to Grandma's on Sunday.
AIskV0efaa	i think as long as your a happy stable couple and have the money for a baby i think  yes you have every right. good luck|`|6lKbDEFDaa	Listen...look at the Octuplet lady. She has no job, but the money. She is not married, so i dont see why someone else that is not married, regardles of the partner choice, shouldnt be allowed the same freedom...best of luck if you are trying to conceive :)|`|MubTZUKXaa	Now that i understand your question I can see it's a very good one!<br>  A 'normal' couple (sorry didn't know how else to word it!) would only be entitled to fertility treatment on the NHS if the long list of criteria was met... I'm not sure what the rules are on same sex couples, I'm sure each area would have different rules....<br>  It's a very touchy subject and I can understand both sides of the argument... <br>  But their point is, Gay or straight:<br>  infertile = NHS fertility treatment...  or <br>  no fertility issues = no NHS fertility treatment.<br>  The same rules apply for 'normal' couples, you can only have it for a medical reason.  Just because they are 'same sex' doesn't mean they can ignore the criteria that others have to go through. Then that would become unfair too.  A normal couple couldn't expect NHS IVF without having a diagnosed fertility problem which has been ongoing for a least two years...<br>  But I can completely understand how sad it must make them to not be entitled to financial help to pay for their treatment... but sorry I don't believe they can jump the queue for being gay...|`|oiJITSNZaa	what are you trying to say?

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	First I'm going to say, name her Josephine Claire no matter what your mother says because Greer is not a name and if you want to call it a name it's an a-s ugly one for a little girl who has to GROW UP with it and live with it for the rest of her life.    Greer Louise  Greer Audrey  Greer Marina    edit: ...because your child suffers so much with a common name like Julia. I would be happy with a creative nice name like Tegan or Avery or something different. but Greer is not a name. Diarrhea is creative too...    Greer Chlamydia?|`|Ya1zZORIaa	Greer Elaine  Greer Kathleen  Greer Eden  Greer Nicole  Greer Elise  Greer Michelle  Thats such a cute name. Brooke Shields's daughter is named Grier Hammond.

But then again, it's not your top option (I do love Josephine Claire).  But, putting that aside, I figure if you're going to go with a more androgenous and trendy  first name, you should try to balance it out with something softer and more classic in the middle.    Greer Amanda  Greer Kathleen  Greer Elizabeth  Greer Maria  Greer Evangeline  Greer Angelina  Greer Gabriella    Something like that I suppose.

d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I remember itching from the stretching, but I don't recall any pain from the c-section during pregnancy at any point. I would say the itching would go on most of the pregnancy and that about all you could do is keep it moisturized with cocoa butter or whatever feels like it works best for you (Palmer's cocoa butter worked for me though). How much worse it'll get will vary too from person to person. I don't recall it being all that bad even though my belly got quite huge.    Good luck to you!|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My last two children were both born by c-section & are 11 mths to the day apart. When I got pregnant with the last my scar would itch and then hurt. My 1st c-section was an emergency so for some reason my stupid dr. cut me almost hip to hip, so my scar was big to begin with. It never changed in size as I got bigger and did stop itching after about 4 mths along. Towards the last 2 weeks it hurt like hell just from pressure and was extremely sensitive to touch.
UznAxq87aa	I took clomid days 3-7 100mg. I took it for 2 cycles and got pregnant on the 2nd cycle. The first cycle I had a lot of side effects, hot flashes and a really high sex drive in the beginning of the cycle. After I ovulated I had cramping (not too bad but they were constant) and my boobs were so sore! A couple of days before my period started my boobs stopped being sore. The second cycle I still had a very high sex drive but very few hot flashes. That was it. I never had sore boobs or any kind of cramps until after I found out I was pregnant, but those were more like stretching pains. My face did break out pretty bad right before I tested.   If this cycle doesn't work out, don't give up. It will happen. Good luck!!

I also have a friend who spells it Alana, and people call her UH-LANE-UH. People also call her UH-LAWN-UH. It probably will be pronounced wrong because both spellings can be easily pronounced wrong!

AA10624857	Children born to identical twins are not necessarily going to look alike. Do you have any siblings who have the same parents as you? If so, do you all look exactly alike? Probably not. The chromosomes that are contained in each sperm and each egg are different so even though 2 children are born to the same parents, they have their own DNA. Now, the chances of the cousins looking alike will be greater simply because of the closeness of the gene pool. But, cousins often look alike or at least share a resemblance even when the parents are not identical twins. So, even though Mary and Jane have the same DNA and James and Michael have the same DNA, each of their respective eggs or sperm are going to contain a different set of chromosomes. Mary and James' children may or may not look like Jane and Michael's, but they will probably have at least some resemblance to each other. Mary and James' children will have their own DNA just like Jane and Michael's children will and it won't be the same DNA.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Techincally they would be so gentically close they would be considered siblings and not cousins, but they wouldn't look indentical to one another.  Many factors (recessive, dominate genes) come into play.|`|79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	They would look alike, but not the same, I'm guessing. Because although it's the same genes, there's still variation.    For example, a couple has a girl. And then two years later, they have another girl. Will the two girls (sisters) look exactly the same at a specified age?  But same pair of genes from their parents, right?    But cool question anyway!|`|AA11607503	No.  They may look similar, but during the time that the egg and sperm are created there is a process called a cross over where the half DNA would not be the same in each sperm or in each egg.    So like I said maybe close, but not so much like identical twins.|`|54b62067d789f103aa1e71fa8e3120f6aa	good question,    My husband is an identical twin but im not.   his twin brother had identical twin girls - freak accident cuz the woman's genes decide if twins.     But I am almost 9months prego and I did a 3d ultrasound at about 7months and my boy looks A LOT like his twin girls from the 3d pics lol.    I will see in about a month for sure how much they look alike    if a blood test was done on me, my child, my hub and his twin   it would come back that both my hub and his twin are the baby's father    Id love to see that on Murray|`|CRAklVJKaa	They look alike, but they dont look the same. If you go to http://www.twinstuff.com the admin is an identical twin who married an identical twin and their twins married each other. You can see their family photo and get the answer to your question.|`|97jVTdFCaa	Well, My great grandma and great grandpa who were both twins married siblings...like my grandma and her sister married my grandpa and his brother. Their kids dont look alike. They have some of the same features, but not like twins or anything. Hope that helps you!|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Not necessarily.  Each person has recessive genetic material from their parents and grandparents.  You never know when it will appear.  Their children probably would look similar.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	identical dna so if say they both had 3 kids at least one would look the same the thing is children take on different traid even with the same parents I have two boys with my husband one looks IDENTICAL to my husband and the other leans more toward my looks. They would look alike but not be the same unless they keep having children untill each gets the same traits. Hope that made sence  p.s I gave you a star|`|R2OMEjrhaa	Yea they would probably look alike, but the likely hood of that actually happening. Probably Not going to happen.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	yes they would because their dna would be identical. Not only that but genetically mary would be janes kids mom and vice versa and also james would be michaels kids dad and vice versa, so if mary wanted to sue michael for child support she would get it even though james is the one she had them with  :)

UX3xjsFlaa	This is funny because I need help potty training my 2 year old daugther too LOL!!  But I do have a 6 year old son who has been potty trained since 2 1/2. Honestly, every child is different. The treats every time he went potty did help with my son- and I let him run around naked. He knew he didnt want to pee/poo on the floor so he would run to his mini-potty and sit down just in time. Of course there was a mess every now and then but we started at age 2 and he was usually the potty exclusively by age 2 1/2.   With my daughter who is 2 1/2 we dont have as much time to let her run around naked- we both work full time jobs. When she is wearing pullups she tells us she is wet or takes off her diaper and goes and sits on the potty!! Its like she knows what she's done but not the feeling right before she's going to do it.  Its tough- but as long as they are potty trained by the time they are 3 I wouldnt worry! Each child is different. Good luck! :)|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Your son is only 2yrs old? First I gotta say the fact that he is even willing to sit on the potty deserves major kudos from you. all kids will go when THEY ARE READY, Whatever you do hun, don't push the issue it can screw him up forever! Just sounds like he isnt quite ready yet and that's okay. I did lots of things, I bought my son his own potty, bought potty books, When he was 3yrs I would have him (not force) him to sit on his potty after meals, and even if he didn't produce anything I gave him lots of praise. I cannot stress to you, how bad it can be if you push this on him. Please be patient and he will go eventually.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	Hi! When my son was about to be potty trained and I did this also in the nursey school I worked for and it worked 100%. Buy some Fruit Loop ceareal and put 2 of each color Fruit Loops in the toilet bowl and make a game of it, tell him to aim for the Blue ones or the Red one and etc. He will start laughing and he will want you to do that all the time until he is fully peeing on his own. The  2 is the hardest part of all and my Dr told me that boys are scared to do  2 in the potty because they feel like they are losing part of themselves and you dont want to be yelling at him all the time because he will never do it and it will put stress on him. Another thing I did with my son was if he made a mess in his underwear, he was to clean his underwear and wash them in the sink with your supervision and believe me hes not going to like that all. Whatever you do, dont smile or laugh when he is doing this because he will think its a joke and wioll continue doing messes in his underwear. Boys are the hardest to train and I give this idea to alot of people and they love it. Also when he is sitting on the potty, you might want to put some books in a basket neear the toilet but when he is playing the Fruit Loop Game, you can move the basket. He can sit there and look at his books, sometimes its a distraction and he might be amaze of himself and you too and when he does do it, jump for joy, clap your hands, make it a party...lol Also do a sticker chart for every time he goes, he gets a star and say if he gets 7 stars, he gets a loittle prize of your choice or the other thing I did too was when he did  2 in the potty I would give him a nickel(they dont know the difference with coins but he was happy)...loland he can put it in his piggy bank, this worked on my little nephew too. He was fully potty trained at 4 and my sister never thought it was possible. Email me if you want other ideas, okay? Wish you the best Hon, it will become easy and you need to be patient with him, boys are stuborn. Good Luck!!  :o)
rAkWoweOaa	December of last year. I had my baby on Sept. 17th and I was 2 weeks over.

The website is www.babyhopes.com.  It will tell you based on your cycles the months you will want to attempt to conceive.  It will plan out your ovulation schedule for the next three months. However you can't guarantee that you will get pregnant in time to be due at that time.  It can take up to six months to a year to get pregnant. Best of luck though and I hope you get what you want.|`|UXoTCL98aa	you would have had to become preg. back in Dec.|`|MH9w47FCaa	Pregancy last 280 days but the count starts at the last menstruation, thereafter you need to have sex approx 266 days before sept 9, 2009... that would be December 13, 2008|`|FVFxE6owaa	You would have had to conceive in December 2008 to have a full-term baby born in September 2009.
D5KdWOfWaa	That's way too little. I don't know what you do for chores but let's say you go out with friends to the mall one day.     Clearly, you can't can't afford even a t-shirt without having saved 6 week's allowance.     You buy one can of soda from a vending machine, and that's more than 1/4th's of your week's allowance. Heaven forbid you get hungry and want a snack, you couldn't even afford that!    I hope you can at least be able to do babysitting or something like that. I would say 10-20 a week is reasonable. Especially if you drive and need to pay for gas!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Nope, you shouldn't have one at all.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You said you don't have much to pay for, what are you complaining about?

Maybe your parents think you dont do enough to earn more that 3.25.  they could be teaching you a early lesson.  You have to work hard if you want more.  Do you have good grades in school.  do you help out around the house?????|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I never got allowance when I was teen. For good behavior, for doing chores and doing good in school, I got to get something I wanted( nothing expensive of course lol). I usually bought a few books from wal mart or went to see a movie.    We weren't poor. There really was no need for allowances. We did good, helped out around the house and we got rewarded by things we wanted. It equaled out really.      I'm not saying we always got what we wanted. My sister was the material type girl and she always wanted the high end stuff, like the newest cell phone out at the time, etc.    I got what I wanted: books and going to the movies because it was inexpensive although there were times where I didn't get that.      Be glad you get even 3.25 a week...it adds up!|`|giKCTfnfaa	my 9 year old would laugh if i gave him $3.25 for an allowance...my 14 year old would probably give it back.  they both earn their allowances.  my 9 year old gets $10...the 14 gets $20 (he does more chores).  that money has to pay for anything they want or do (outside of family activities).|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, it is sad that you are not allowed to get a job if you are able to handle it and maintain your grades, etc.  It would teach you responsibility and the value of a dollar.      I do agree that $3.25 a week is an inadequate sum, especially for a teenager, but it is better than nothing-right?  My children are 8 and 10 and get more than that for their allowance.    However, I have to comment on one statement you made-you do not "deserve" an allowance.  That you are getting anything at all is something you should be thankful for because, like I said-$3.25 is better than nothing.|`|fQ9MPAUpaa	i'd go for it...... i don't get an allowance.......|`|s2JvJ5alaa	Your child should be grateful that he/she is even getting an allowance.  My parents never gave me or my siblings any money unless we were doing extra chores around the house and we deserved it.  If he/she complains, you can always tell them that it's a privilege to get an allowance and you can easily take it away.|`|WLynh3bCaa	Depends if you do anything around the house- if not, then $5 is probably a decent amount. If  you do do a decent amount around the house, then you should get at least $8.|`|3tDqt9sXaa	nope with prices of everything these days that does not get you much.  but if you dont have to pay for much then it really does not make a difference|`|usb9nzJjaa	LMFAO my 6 yr old gets 20 bucks every two weeks lol...... ok seriously i remember those days I would make a business plan of things u can do around the house and why you should have an increased allowance.l This will make you seem serious and they will take you serious and also it will show them you listen at school.. good luck|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	Not trying to be rude, but what makes you think you deserive an allowance? Again, not trying to be rude but if you think you deserve it, then write it out and show it to your parents. Maybe they dont see your side of it. You have to know WHY they think 3.25 is a good number. Im sure they didnt pull it out of thin air. Knowing that will give you a basis to ask for more.
gRcVgmxVaa	These could be early pregnancy symptoms.  Pregnancy tests can register an early pregnancy as early as 8 days past ovulation (not typical though). There are many early pregnancy tests on the market that could possibly show positive right now. First Response Early Response or even tests from the Dollar Tree are sensitive enough to detect early levels of the pregnancy hormone HCG.   HOWEVER a negative test result does not mean you are not pregnant. Retest in a few days.  And yes, you can get pregnant using the "pull and pray" method.|`|6ab3673bb81ad84f3158efb113c25ce3aa	it's a sign that you may be pregnant .. good luck!|`|xukz46NFaa	11 days after sex... Sweetie, there is no way of telling that early. Your period due to the stress of the sexual intercourse- could cause you to miss/skip your period... If you think you might be preg- do a test in 3 weeks or wait till ur next date. you can take the test 25 days after sex and have it 99% accurate.    When in doubt though- no period for more than two cycles deserves a trip to the doctors office.. Blood test time.......|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	other than ovulation time stuff... idk.|`|OBgqkkqlaa	Im not sure but the one sign that lets me know that I'm pregnant, are sore tingling breasts.
aMcYK663aa	At your first appointment they will ask you a million questions about your health history, have you pee in a cup (you will do this at every appt), ask where you want to have the baby at, take your blood, give you lots of information sheets about pregnancy, they will do a pap smear if you are due for one, and you may get an ultrasound - it could be an internal one, so don't be surprised (it's just because the baby is so small right now, it easier to see it from, well - where everything started. ;)  As for your boyfriend - it is great that he is coming with you.  Have him come to every single one until your baby is born.  Since this is your first - ask all the questions you can possibly think of... your Dr is getting paid a lot of money to deliver your baby, so ask away.  Also get your boyfriend to think of some questions - I'm sure his mind is running at 200mph... it's an exciting time.  They will not do any tests on your boyfriend... just you.  Good luck!|`|AA11763588	If this is your first appointment then they will probably get a urine sample, a few viles of blood from you, probably do a pelvic check and do a pap smear. They may check your breasts as well. They may do an Ultra sound and they may try to hear the baby's heart beat.    They won't do any blood test to your BF.    They will ask you YOUR family history, so try to know everything that you can, especially from your mothers side.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	they will take blood and do an ultrasound they wont touch him maybe ask if he is your man and all that fun mushy stuff|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	If they haven't already..they will take blood and give you a pap smear.  They won't do anything to your b/f.  Unless there are complications or a question of when you conceived, they probably won't do an ultrasound. If there are no complications, normally your first ultrasound is at 18-20 weeks. I am surprised this will be your second appointment and you are only 6 weeks. Most of the time the Dr won't even see you until you are 8 weeks. Sometimes later. It is probably too early to hear the heartbeat with a doppler in the office, but they might try to. Other than that, they will just ask how you are feeling. Congrats!!    They might ask about his families medical history, but it will just be questions. No blood test or anything. They mostly care about the mother's history.
6yYeCVQFaa	Yup. Honestly, I have weed myself a little since being pregnant when I sneeze or vomit depending on the strength of either. My belly was very hard when I first got pregnant and if you are sexually active that is usually the biggest sign that you could be pregnant. My appetite didn't increase until recently, though and I am 11 weeks. Take a pregnancy test and call me in the morning. :) Good luck!|`|xMy0QEvFaa	Take a pregnancy test or get a blood test done.  and you don't need your mom to go to the clinic.    You may be pregnant.|`|2722dc4f9ad14b1f710802a19159d586aa	I'm 7 weeks preg and have the same symptoms.
uMNoVPxoaa	They could just be checking up on you, since they dispensed medication that affects some people negatively.....|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Some std's don't show symptoms right away or at all. Or they just calling you to tell you they came back negative for anything. Just call back. Jeez!|`|GLJkGgloaa	It's not that bad really.  I have missed calls from "Donna" AKA Planned Parenthood before. Relax, you don't have some disease.|`|vejHKjEDaa	So?   I think everyone should get a 'missed call' from taxpayer-supported Planned Parenthood - their name should be changed to Planned Abortion as they fund more abortions than anyone else on the planet. People wouldn't have to "hope" they're clean from STD's if they were more prudent - seems it would be less stressful to "know" they're clean..|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Just call them back.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	did u get tested for std while u were there? don't stress it, maybe it's about a payment or something, just wait and see, before u get all worked up!|`|ZItclHxraa	The really bad thing is the morning after pill. Do some research. Quite having sex! Protected or not. Then you will not have to worry yourself about any calls!!!
fALkYOC1aa	It is possible for you to be pregnant.  The odds are VERY low, but it could happen.  You won't be able to tell until after your next cycle. I hope everything works out for you. :)|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	ch3ck out th3r3 site h3r3: I us3d it wh3n I thought I was too.       www.nuvaring.com      **ch3ck it out... might h3lp|`|23fDrmZoaa	The niva ring hormones only stay in your system for 3 hours after you take it out. I was on the ring and still got pregnant but i think where you got your period the day after you had sex that you probally arent pregnant. Wait until next month, put your ring in like normal and just wait. If you miss your next period call your gym|`|FVDhYH6Baa	since you had your period  i doubt you're pregnant  just take a test to be sure|`|7iPTUVrOaa	You only had your period ONE day after. You could still get pregnant. Go take a test in a few weeks.
Lsa2LPrMaa	why dont you ask your doctor.  i think you should be giving her regular milk now,  but water is okay too  also try changing her oatmeal cereal every few days she must get tired of eating that everday.  try cheerios, or something like that|`|n6XYYyoLaa	mix it with different fruits...|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Try just hand expressing into the cereal directly.  thats what I do with all of my sons purees.  It takes like 2 minutes.  babies really shouldn't have juice, my doctor said they can, ut my pediatrician said to skip it altogether.  Water is ok but doesn't add any nutrition or flavor.  Are you trying other foods as well?|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Water is fine (:|`|r52rfBkeaa	You can add water or juice if you'd like.  I added apple juice to my son's cereal sometimes if I didn't have any expressed milk to use (or if I wasn't home).  Once you know she's not allergic to apple juice, you can try grape or another non-acidic juice too.  I think it's a good way to introduce new flavors to your child.  Have fun with it!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	We always used rice milk. It is pretty easy easy to get in stores, or U can make your own. There is also almond milk, oat milk, etc. Some babies do not so well on soy, but can handle it later as toddlers. I also made rice cream from organic brown rice, to alternate with the oatmeal for variety. It is simple to make, and U can add veggies & fruit to it, and save money instead of always buying commercial baby food.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I did breast milk only in the cereal when we started at 6 months, but began adding mashed up veggies like peas and carrots in with the rice cereal at about 8 months.  You can also add mashed up fruits, like bananas, pears, or apples.    He's 1 y/o now and loves green veggies, so I'm glad I started with them.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	I do apple juice in my 7 month old's cereal...in the morning.  Her Dr suggested I do that to help keep her bm's regular.    If she has cereal at night..I just mix it with water.    I have alot of troubles with pumping..so I know what a pain it is to pump everytime you want to give her cereal!|`|202ff5e36fd233f7e4e10b9bde6c914daa	Water or juice is fine..|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Well, I was told by my pedi, to mi grape juice in, because it aids in iron absorption. Also, I used formula, and why it's getting such a horribly bad rap is beyond me. I think it is wonderful that you breastfeed exclusively, but formula is a necessary product for many babies/mothers.|`|claW4UUcaa	my daughter will be seven months old tomorrow she is breastfed also. i only used breast milk for the first feeding. i use water now.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I have mixed water with oatmeal. I have even heated up some regular milk and mixed it with it. The reason why they tell you not to give your child regular milk before a year old is because there isnt enough nutrients in regular milk like there is in breastmilk and formula. But she is getting nutrients from the oatmeal so she should be ok.. I would try that. Good Luck!|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i've only used water to make oatmeal for my daughter. our peditrician said this was fine.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	Do not give her regular cows milk until ONE YEAR OF AGE.  The pasturisation etc is not good for them until they are one and have teeth. I add mashed bananas, peach, or stewed apple to my sons cereal, even avocado.  Nothing too strong.|`|d0e10e643d80c474c11bc076052dc77aaa	I sometimes add Pedialyte to the cereal as the cereal makes my sons poop more firm and the Pedialyte helps prevent that. Plus it adds flavor without adding all that sugar like in juice.|`|ORy1HG0yaa	Water is fine to mix it with. You could also mix it with juice, something plain like apple juice. Additionally, you could mix it with pureed food! My son ate squash cereal, applesauce cereal, and banana cereal, and he enjoyed it! Good luck and congrats!|`|5b718e8b5da22eef2054bababfe2064caa	I usually mix it with formula or any kind of gerber my baby gets fuller
UFLfNlDfaa	My lamaze teacher told me to go to Walmart or Target and just get an exercise ball (it's the same thing as a birthing ball)... they range from $10 to $30 dollars. She also said not to air it up until you get to the hospital and also to not fill it all the way full of air because you want it to give some when you sit on it. Some hospitals have birthing balls available as well so you'll want to check with your birthing facility. Hope this helped!
fa8ec0dfbeb6f313e56b1b76f66f6d47aa	I tested 6 times for my first child.  Mainly because I didn't believe the results.  I had been waiting so long.  I had another test done at the Dr. and they said their tests are no different than what you would buy in the store, unless you had a blood test.  They also informed me that there are no false positives.  If the test comes out positive, the hormone is there.  Sometimes, the test can come out a false negative though, depending on the levels of hormone.  I would suggest a Dr. appt to confirm.  Unless for some reason she miscarried really early I would say she is pregnant and to stop testing because she is stressing herself out!  Best of luck to you!  God Bless!|`|FLOjzbKEaa	not sure what to say.  why dosent she go to see a doctor..he will do a blood test which is very accurate|`|yCR6qg0baa	Walmart tests are crap to begin with. Testing at different times of the day could make the lines be darker or lighter than on an identical test. Have her go to her doctor for a blood test. If she goes Monday morning, they'll be able to tell her yes or no & how far along she is by Monday afternoon. Congrats!|`|savPsYWjaa	The baby is drinking the blood. That is why the period is lighter because babby is still small.|`|J7GTIE5raa	go to the doctor and take a real test|`|nvsVXlBlaa	go to the doctor, chances are yes you are pregnet, usally a test will not come back that you are pregnet if your not, but they have a chance that they will come back negitive when you are.   go to a doctor and they can do a test and a ultrasound if needed|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yes, she is pregnant.  The tests measure the level of HCG (pregnancy hormone) in the body.  The first response tests measure at a lower level for early pregnancy, usually 20 to 25 HCG.  It grows though.  It doubles every 2 to 3 days.  The equate (and most of the generic or store brands) measure at 100 to 150 HCG.  If she got the first two as positive but not the last that means it's early.  She is about 4 to 5 weeks.  When she is about 6 weeks it would show positive on the equate HPT's.  Congrat's, go find yourself a good midwife so you'll have the best pregnancy experience possible and enjoy your new life.|`|0QXQu5hvaa	5th times the charm...|`|PrYY4xQUaa	She could be take a blood test it is more accurate and wow that is the longest cycle i have ever heard about my cycle is at most 5 days but usually 4|`|WNEzbJC9aa	if u see a Doctor he/she will give u a right answer|`|KNxs4PrZaa	during early pregnancy around the time your period is due its not uncommon to get mixed results because tests are all different and detect different levels of hormones.  go to the docotrs and have a blood test done to confirm either way. i would say if you had two poitives you can start being happy though its very uncommon to get false positves.|`|4uvxz1VEaa	i would say have her go to the hospital and have blood work done. that will give a deff. positive or negative.  good luck|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	She is pregnant congrats. What it is is that one test is better at registering lower amounts of the pregnancy hormone.  The levels should increase as the pregnancy continues but when she took the Equates she may not have had enough in her system to register on that test. Congrats and see a doctor as soon as possible.    The only other thing I can think of is a chemical pregnancy. This happens sometimes. It is where the egg is fertilized giving off the hormone but it doesn't implant correctly. So see a doctor and post to let us know.|`|CT3hTng7aa	false negatives happen all of the time...the only time a false positive generally would occur is after giving birth because there are still traces of the pregnancy hormone still in the system.  My suggestion is to either spring for the 20 bucks and buy the test that says pregnant or not pregnant (much easier to read) or just have her go to the doctor and take a lab test.
eya1WDS4aa	Yes to early for a dollar store test. Wait until the 4th and see if your period comes if it doesnt then get a 1st response test.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Its possible your pregnant.  Usually the signs ur pregant are the signs of PMS you get right before your period|`|x9bW1bD4aa	Im not a doctor so see one please.it could be just hormonal or ovarian cysts or your ovulating but a doctor is trained in this department|`|AA10943329	I would never trust a kit that cost a dollar. All your symptoms point to either pregnancy or your period. We are not able to tell. I know you are looking for people to say YES! your pregnant as this is the answer you want but until the test says positive there is no way to tell.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I get those before i get my period at times.. but have also got the same things when i was pregnant, wait another week, if you haven't gotten your period then take another test... the dollar store tests work just as good as any other! I've taken them before myself lol.
h5OYD8TIaa	YES!  It totally freaked me out.    According to my period I was supposed to be 8 1/2 weeks  but according to the ultrasound I was only measuring 7.3-7.5 weeks.    But nothing to worry about if the doctor isn't worried.  The ultrasound can be up to 1 week even 10 days off.  It's just an estimate.    SO my due date now is Aug 30-Sept 8th.  LOL....|`|h5LOGiCmaa	Yes it has happend to many women, including me.    My due dates are 1 week apart.  Ultrasounds are never 100% accurate.|`|IxYf6t4haa	Yes.  It happened to me a few weeks ago.  Doctor said according to my menstrual period I should be 8 1/2 weeks. But the Ultrasound showed 7 1/2 weeks.  But doctor said it could be due to her technology, it is not as high tech as other Vaginal Ultrasound machines, Also, it could be due to my period being 35-40 days apart NOT 28 days apart. There is nothing to worry about.  I should have listened to my mom.  She said when it is early, it is very early, and its all  guesstimating.  I should have waited till after my 3rd trimester to get an Ultrasound.  She says that women that get early ultrasounds scare women for no reason, when everything is ok.  I'll do that with my next pregnancy.  Ok, it's not the norm, but my baby needs time to grow, and I don't care what anyone thinks.  I will still take care of myself, like take vitamins, etc.  Good luck with your pregnancy. Do not worry.  And pray to God always.|`|2c34f694bb2db719dd7d5fea97358269aa	well I am 7 weeks pregnant and my doctor said I was 5, did my ultrasound last week and I'll be 8 weeks on tuesday!|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	How accurate is ultrasound at setting due dates?  A study has shown that an ultrasound isn't any more accurate than a reliable menstrual history combined with a pelvic exam by an experienced obstetrician. Researchers confirmed this by looking at pregnancies with known conception dates and comparing due dates arrived at by ultrasound measurements with dates arrived at by menstrual history and pelvic exam (4).    The fact that the old-fashioned method for dating a pregnancy does just as well as ultrasound is a vital point. While a sonogram may be useful in cases where there is uncertainty about when conception occurred, first-trimester sonograms are currently used as the ultimate standard. Your due date will often be changed if it differs from the one derived from the sonogram no matter how the date was previously determined or how sure you are of when you conceived.    Even first-trimester sonograms have a range of plus or minus five days, or a ten-day window, around the calculated date (3). The range increases to plus or minus eight days in the second trimester and plus or minus ten days for third-trimester scans. For this reason, experts say the due date should not be altered based on results from an early scan unless the calculated date differs by two weeks or more from the date determined by physical signs and symptoms and menstrual history (3).    What does this mean to you?    The first lesson to be learned is have patience, unless there is a good reason not to wait for nature to take its course. When the fruit is ripe, it will fall from the tree. Inducing labor may be presented as a far more straightforward decision than it actually is. Think carefully about the risks and benefits of an induction recommended solely because you have not begun labor before some arbitrary cut-off date. Because it introduces risks, intervening in the natural process should only be undertaken to fix something that has gone awry.|`|LABC73E7aa	according to my cycle im due feb 2nd (monday!) but according to my early ultrasound im due feb 11th... all i know is im still pregnant!|`|D6wwOv03aa	YES! AND according to the dr. who was delivering my second my daughter would weigh 6.5 lbs because of the early birth, she came out 8.9 lbs. He looked so surprised|`|iwYu32N2aa	Probably the majority of the women on here have. Due dates are just estimated guess, not exact, and when they do give you a due date, you probably wont have your kid on that day any way.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yes,many times. Ultrasounds and things like that are just an educated guess.|`|6avKnzkoaa	HCG levels, LMP dating, and U/S are merely just estimations. Though most doctors, at least mine did, went by the early ultrasounds.     HCG levels aren't always accurate because the range can be very huge.    LMP dating aren't always accurate because sometimes people don't ovulate exactly 14 days after their last period began. And for me, my periods were never regular.    Ultrasounds are estimations as measurements can vary.    Ultimately, in the end, the baby will come out when he/she is ready =]
K7AqDR9gaa	hey!  i got the same thing!except i was 8 days past ovulation.af is due today for me but i havent got it.im waiting for at least monday to test.i never even thought about bieng possibly pregnant until that light pink/brown spotting happened!so now im just waiting.but i really think im pregnant after that happened and now i think that your pregnant also!i hope we are.unless you've experience odd spotting between periods before then i would say that you have a big chance of bieng pregnant.i would wait at least another week to test  good luck!|`|f5pticCLaa	I think you are pregnant :)  Good Luck!!!

PlmT4lHXaa	I take Aleese too, and ive never gotten pregnant.    I started having sex about 1.5 weeks after I first started taking it and its always worked well for me.    Its always a SMALL possibility you could get pregnant, but its highly unlikely if you are taking it correctly. Use condoms AND birth control if you are worried.
F8iyUqJBaa	Six weeks is what they use as a general guideline.  If you talk to a midwife they will tell you the truth about what to look for.  What you are waiting for is the bleeding to stop completely, then wait another 3 days after that.  This tells you that your body is back to "normal", your cervix is closed up.  If you are not bleeding and haven't been for at least three days, have fun to your comfort level.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	You do not have to wait the entire 6 weeks. Just remember that you could very easily get pregnant again so make sure you use protection. This happened to me, at my 8 week check up I never expected to hear the word Congratulations come out of my Dr's. mouth! So my youngest 2 sons are 11 mths to the day apart!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I also had to wait 8 weeks for my checkup due to my doc being booked up..

As for you I dont think sex would hurt as long as you feel back to yourself and are up to it give it a go!!|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I would not do anything tell I went back to see the doc.|`|Bw18seFqaa	its reccommended, but obviously, not everyone follows that rule, as there are many women who have babies 9 months apart!    Use the best of your judgement.. if you are not sore, it may be safe to proceed with sex.  Do be aware that you CAN get pregnant again, so if you are not ready to have another baby just yet, do use contraceptives.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	You should stay away from tampons while you still have postpartum bleeding. Once you get your period again you can use them.    You should wait to have sex until you stop bleeding. But you can have sex as soon as you want after that. Just be gentle the first couple of times. And make sure to use some form of birth control, you can get pregnant, even if your breastfeeding.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	After having a baby you can have sex when the postpartum bleeding stops and when you feel physically ready to have sex. If you didn't require any stitches and you feel as though you are ready to have sex, than do it! There may be some discomfort at first but stop or slow down if there is pain.  I too didn't require any stitches and I had a straight forward, uncomplicated labour. My bleeding stopped 1.5 weeks after birth. I had sex with my husband 2.5 weeks after giving birth without any problems or pain.  With regards to using a tampon. Do not use one until you have your first period. Before that time, the risk of infection is too great.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You are just suppose to wait 6 weeks after having a baby to have sex or use tampons|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	You don't HAVE to wait until the six week check-up to have sex, but if you don't wait, you should know that your fertility is even greater right after having a baby.  My sister didn't wait until her six week check-up to have sex and when she went for her six week check-up, the doctor discovered that she was pregnant again.  Now she's got two boys a little over 10 months apart.  So be sure to use some type of birth control.|`|gcV4CJrraa	What the rush!  Their is a lot of other things that you can do to satisfy each other.  I would rather be safe than sorry.  You are not completely healed until about 6 weeks.  Their is always that one in a million chance of infection.|`|bQTATDTyaa	Once you stop bleeding that means the uterus has healed, so the risk of infection is almost non-existent.    I had sex at 3 1/2 weeks, my midwife recommended 4-6 weeks but also said that if I wasn't bleeding and up to it to go ahead earlier. Just use birth control of some sort.|`|7FvVx3kVaa	I personally didn't wait until my 6 week check-up. They say that just to make sure, everything is healing back up normal.  But, just to worn you sence you just had a baby it is a lot easier to get pregnant for the first year. So, if you don't want another one yet, best to use protection or birth controll. (I didn't and I found out how easy it was haha:) ) But, you really don't have to wait. Hope, all goes well!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	no tampons,  no sex, nothing in the vagina until after u have been examined to make sure everything has closed back up unless u r willing to risk infection|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, they say you're supposed to wait until 6 weeks to get the go ahead.  We didn't, I felt fine at about 4ish weeks so we gave it a shot.    At my 6 week appointment, my OB/GYN looked at me slyly and asked  "Had sex yet?"  I said we had.  She asked "How'd it go?"  I said it was fine.  She nodded and that was that.    Honestly, if it's too early, you'll know immediately and want it to stop.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Loads of women do not. You wouldn't be breaking any laws or anything. Use common sense; stop if there's pain.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If it's 8 weeks, I'd say it's okay as long as you don't have a fever and you're done with lochia.   The tampons really need to be not used until your first menstrual cycle after delivery, using it for the lochia is not a good idea, your cervix is still open and closes slowly - a penis doesn't stay that long and isn't inserted (usually) using fingers, which are so much dirtier - think about all the things you can't scrub out from under your finger nails and what you use your hands for (diapers, cooking chicken, cat box....)   It's not stitches, it's not even bleeding, it's the way open cervix that is of a concern.|`|oIFMohfUaa	LOL!      If there is no pain...then sex is totally up to YOU.      Usually the "rule" is there for you to heal, especially for stitches.    It is also that gives the doctor time to talk to you about birth control...before you become pregnant again.   And along that line, be careful if you don't want another pregnancy...my sis in law had hers 8 1/2 months apart...she said, "Whoops..." lol.    NO for tampons.  The reason is that your cervix may still be slightly open and bacteria can more easily enter.  It is also still sensitive and the material can irritate your cervix.    Ummm, have fun?|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	honestly no but to be safe i would|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I waited 3 weeks and I did have stitches. If it hurts don't...if it doesn't go for it. :)
oIFMohfUaa	If your baby is comfortable, keep swaddling!  He'll let you know when he's uncomfortable!    If he's moving during waking hours, he's exercising his arms!    He probably feels very secure.    Good luck!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if your baby is uncomfy in the wrap, they will let you know....as long as baby isn't wrapped when awake, they will develop muscles just fine...my dd is seven mos old and we have recently been getting her used to the crib for naps, and guess what? the only way she will sleep there is wrapped!! she sleeps fine at night in a sleepsack, but i guess she needs the comfort to sleep in the new place....and she is strong, ahead of her milestones and smart as a whip....so don't worry, if baby likes it, no prob|`|X40Ww89qaa	as long as she gets to move around during the day|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I think that when she starts fussing and the blankets are no longer "magic" that you'll know to stop using them.  My son is 5mon and I still swaddle him tightly with one blanket every night.  Most of the time when I check on him after he's asleep, he'll have one or two arms out.  He's more comfortable sleeping when he's wrapped up.  I think it is fine for as long as she likes it.|`|mCbe2a67aa	I swaddled my son until he was 4 months old. Granted, it was only his legs and not his arms, but he was still swaddled and on his back when he was 4 months. They tell you not to swaddle after a month because it's said that it can hinder a babies development. You're right, at about that age they start to move around and are figuring out how to sleep on their own, so if they are constantly swaddled they can't work things out for themselves and then when they get older it will be harder to get them to sleep without the swaddling. Honestly I would have done it longer but my son was waking up every 2 hours anyway, even with the swaddle, so it's not like it was doing anything in the first place, so we just stopped.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	we swaddle our six week old son every time he goes in for a nap/bed.  it helps him sleep much better.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i swaddled my son for the first 8 months. it was the only way hed sleep.    i stopped doing it when he learned to roll
6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	Hey looks like we are on the same tract. I stopped end of november and i just got it now end of jan! might as well say feb! So i think it must be normal. I would say if you don't get one in 3-4 more weeks call up the dr and ask for an appointment. I did and well the next day I got mine. I kind of wish I just waited one more day. But It is good that I went they did find a lump so now we are thinking of putting off TTC until the test come back.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	i concieved my first two after two weeks of beinf off thr bc patch, and little over a month with my thrid. I just got my IUD taken out on 1/20 and it took 3 days to get my visit from af. I got a positive OPK today so hopfully, i will get a BFP soon. Best of luck and baby dust to you|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I stopped in June of 08, got my first period in July and was pregnant by the beginning of August. I'm due with  3 in 3 months.  But it's different for each person.  Just hang in there.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	For me, it took about 8 months before I ovulated and had a period.  I didn't get preggo for 18 months.  This was after about 10 years of various hormonal birth control methods.
JITTMjasaa	I felt the same way after I saw my ultrasound, and I didn't know the sex yet either. The only problem with me is I don't like yellow or green (both neutral colors). I just looked around every store I went to and happened to come across some adorable Carters at Toys R Us. They are an off white with dark tan/light brown. They have a jungle theme and say "little tiger", so adorable. You could go with yellow or green but a light brown and off white or white would be my best choice. I like how unconventional it is too. Congrads on your lil munchkin. Welcome to the wonderful world of cramps, cravings, and strange little movements. Best of luck. God Bless|`|K6rZmVmAaa	I;ve just got bottles and a few unisex sleepsuits. Got a feeling I'm having another girl so want to wait before I buy many clothes.

Hope that this helps you some.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	Hi,  anything you buy can be gener neutral, right down to nursery furnishings.  I love neutral colours.  We know we are having a boy, but I have not bought a single blue item. Our nursery is all lemon, and clothing is all nice beiges and creams. If you want to start buying so early I would suggest some ultra cute baby grows in beiges, or even nice ultrasound scan photo frames that you can put in the babies room.  There are good ones on ebay! Have fun mamma! x|`|98WKYtfwaa	You could buy some clothes for your baby, such as a little going out suit.<br>  <br>  White, cream and light brown are nice for both genders. I don't think that yellow or green are for both genders, simply because yellow looks more girlish and green looks more boyish, but that's upto you.<br>  <br>  You can get lots of nice things though, just look in the baby section of most stores.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	neutral of almost everything<br>  carseat<br>  stroller<br>  0-3 clothes<br>  sleeper<br>  towels<br>  crib<br>  blanket<br>  bottles<br>  breast pump if breast feeding<br>  boucer<br>  bibs burp clothes<br>  diapers<br>  whipes shampoo diaper bag<br>  <br>  for some too u could wait until u know the sex or u could save it for the next & would have to buy other things if it was a different sex|`|1fyyOhLraa	Well if you don't know the sex then don't buy anything till you find out or buy boy and girl clothes and take back the clothes you don't need after you find the sex.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	Anything in green, yellow, tan, sometimes red, and baby blue can go both ways.<br>  You can also buy diapers, it's never to soon to start buying those :]|`|vlRqiYtWaa	Congratulations!<br>  Yellow works for both genders and is super cute too!<br>  :)|`|RGOgb856aa	pastel yellow and green are pretty neutral annnd they're supercute!|`|7RLY2itSaa	Before we knew the sex of the baby, (we found out 2 weeks ago we are having a girl) we bought some creamy yellow baby grows.. They are quite boring... so we stopped buying clothes and in the early weeks we bought baby books and shopped around for the buggy and crib etc.. we also had fun making out a list of all the things we needed! After finding out we are having a girl we went wild and bought loads of tiny pink things, socks, hats dresses.. it was so much fun and felt so great.. so if you are going to find out the sex i would say wait and go wild becuase you wont want to put you're little girl or boy in nuetral things!|`|AA10988087	Congratulations-I am due actually two days before you-but any whoo-<br>  <br>  seeing how you know your gettingA lott of stuff for your baby shower-let that be the boy or girl stuff- but their is plenty you can purchase now without knowing the sex. <br>  <br>  Some things i recommend:<br>  Cabinett locks, outlet protectors tbaby proofof the rooms, door knob locks, mattress pads-for the crib- baby bottles(im breastfeeding so i wont need as many) depending on the store brand -Avent has just plain clear ones, plain white onesies-baby first aid kit-wipes, diapers, pacifiers(i have found a few that could be both)-diaper bag(ydon'tont have to go with something that matches the gender of the baby)im personally going with a black diaper bag-burp clothes(cloth diapers work great too), baby hygiene products(bdon'tont get too many of the same things, some babies are allergic differentent products), if you knwo what type of stroller system you want whether its a boy or girl you could purchase accessories(i.e. stroller netting, protects from mosquitoes, a vinyl covering shields from rain,) but you could also look at some stores in their clothing department they may have some cute gender neutral stuff-the problem im finding is that even if it says gender neutral it will have stuff the makes it not gender neutral like a truck or some other gurly or boy items-so be carefull-i have seen cute duck/bear outfits that look totally gender neutral-thier are tons of first aid items(i.e ear thermomter) that you could get-

Implantation would have happened about 2 weeks ago, if you are pregnant you're about 5-6 weeks along.|`|WK5s7VSaaa	you gotta see a doctor ASAP. it could b nothing, it could b something, either way see a doctor.
DXLfxoTNaa	It's good you want to quit. The sooner the better because the beginning is so crucial.  Smoking while pregnant lowers birth weight- it hinders development. Moms who claim their children are fine later notice their kids have learning disabilities and have many problems in school. They are more likely to get in trouble not following rules and end up blaming the school for the problems.  And believe me when you hear a baby or preschooler weezing from asthma it breaks you heart.    Try suckers or straws, something to help with oral fixation of cigarette.   Think of your baby when it gets tough.|`|ku7s4H83aa	Talk to your doctor, and pray,pray, pray. Good luck.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	stop buying more|`|VrjF986Aaa	just stop... seriously I get so mad when pregnant women smoke.. it's so damn selfish to put your baby in danger just for a dumb vice  you can try nicotine gum or the patch if you have a lot of trouble, but seriously, you need to quit for your babies sake. If you can't even sacrifice something like cigarettes for 9 months for your baby, well you won't be a very good parent b/c being a parent requires a lot of sacrifices for the sake of the child.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Well, it is very important to do everything you can to help the baby be healthy, I would say talk to your doctor. But only the thought that it might be dangerous for baby should help you quit. Good luck!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	morning sickness really helped this with me...i couldn't standddd smoking or being around it when i started to get morning sickness.good luck.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I smoked before finding out about my pregnancies. I made a point of having my "last" pack and bought no more. It was hard but I did it. So, can you! :-) Best of Luck|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	I smoked also before I got preggo. As a matter of fact a pack a day also. When I was pregnant with my son I had quit before I found out because I was getting sick from the smell of it. With this pregnancy I just quit as soon as I found out. You just have to keep saying in your mind it's hurting your baby and that will help you to stop. (if you love your unborn child)|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Will power|`|b5JnSBstaa	I also smoke a pack a day before I took my pregnancy test. I had no idea I was pregnant, but the second I had a positive pregnancy test I quit smoking cold turkey.  That is just what you have to do. It was very hard and I wanted to smoke again so bad, but I knew that it was hurting my baby.  Its the most unselfish thing you can do.  The chemicals in smoke constrict blood vessels and will slow the blood flow to your baby depriving he/she from oxygen and nourishment, it could even stunt the growth.  Please quit smoking now and going cold turkey is the only way.
CxQ3XW4eaa	Firstly, I want to congratulate you on the safe arrival of your new little one.  Ok, now listen. I admit i'm no doctor and im not here to say others are wrong when they say you have baby blues but your partner isnt helping you sweetheart, not like he should and he also isnt bonding with the baby either what with going out so soon.  If anyone thinks that a baby brings people closer I disagree.. what it will do is unite you if you are a good unit or it can push you apart because a newborn is one hell of a responsibility and a huge commitment, a life commitment that along with the love you (will) feel, comes hard tiring times, sleepless nights, tantrums, cries, etc etc.. they are so demanding and on your own is obviously going to be more difficult.<br>  <br>  You need to voice your concern with your partner. Whether your 'used to it' or not hun, now you need to put your guard down and say 'i want your help and I need your help, your input and your support'..Im awful for tiring myself out and doing everything wanting no interference or help from any other, and to be like that is real hard to accept help because it can make you feel like a bit of a failure or that your not capable in some way.  I've grown to realise that accepting or asking for help makes you a stronger person.. you shouldnt need to do this alone if you have a partner. and if thats what he intends to be, a partner to you and a daddy to your baby then he needs to support you, both of you.  <br>  <br>  I think the way you feel toward your baby is a sign of slight postnatal depression,, this can be real tough and its really important that you talk about it whether it be with a friend, a family member or a doctor - take each day at a time and dont beat yourself up for not feeling like there is a bond with you and your baby just yet. Thousands of Mums feel that way. There is such a huge expectation that when you see your baby for the first time it will be love at first sight and you will feel a huge bond.  So obviously if you dont feel this way its very disheartening and you worry thinking that its 'abnormal' in some way which will bring yourself down even further. <br>  <br>  Having a newborn is a huge deal and sometimes, alot of the time, new Mums struggle terribly if they dont feel the way the 'think' they should or how 'every other mum feels' more women feel like you do than maybe you think so give yourself a hug, and remind yourself how well your doing.  Your not only battling with feeling low after giving birth but your relationship is also a very lonely one where you have a partner .. but then again you ask yourself if you do ?? - <br>  <br>  If it were just baby blues hun then i'd understand and agree if your partner was supportive and caring toward you and you were having help and feeling loved. But your not getting that, your not getting the tlc you so badly deserve and that can make you feel like complete sh**... excuse my language.  I just cant bare the thought that your asking yourself if your losing your mind.. Look at all you do.. look at your gorgeous baby.. and realise 'its you' that has created that perfect little being, you that nurtured and carried that baby and its you that that baby needs... its you that is keeping everything ticking.. and what are you getting in return? right now it feels like nothing.. so it is more than understandable how your feeling... your not losing your mind or your marbles or anything else for that matter.. your a new Mummy who is pretty much exhausted and has no support.<br>  <br>  My advice is to talk talk talk... to anyone.. but you also need to talk to your partner out right.. if there are underlying issues and the relationship isnt working for whatever reason then thats something that you will both need to work on.. but you must tell him how you are feeling. Soon enough you will know if he is listening and if he isnt then you need to take care of number one and number one... you and your baby.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I really hope your able to feel better soon and praise yourself every time you look at your baby and every time you look in the mirror - you've done and still are doing amazing.<br>  <br>  Take care xxxx|`|cYRZpGkqaa	It sounds like you have postpartum depression. Talk to your ob/gyn. They will know the right treatment. Hang in there. It'll pass.|`|5DJcir9saa	Sounds like you have the baby blues which is totally normal.  Your hormones are all out of whack right now, so you can't help the way you feel.  It certainly doesn't help that you don't have a supportive partner.  Don't worry, you will develop a bond with your baby....he is only 12 days old, so give it some time.  When I first had my son, my husband and I both said it just felt like we were babysitting for an extended period of time...LOL  Because your partner is not giving the extra support you need right now, you should speak with your doctor about how you feel and let him/her put you at ease.  If this feeling continues it could lead to post pardom depression.|`|XSEWADI0aa	yes call the dr, get in fast...|`|AA10607821	Sounds exactly like post partum blues.  You can still reason things in your mind but your feelings just don't catch up to what your mind says you should feel.  Let your doctor know you have the blues and if you have someone, possibly another female who understands, you can talk to until you feel better.  Things will get better, just hang in there.|`|pHAKN32yaa	what i did and what helped me was, asking for help.<br>  plain and simple. dont be affraid to ask for help!<br>  The laundry, dishes, vauuming and all that other stuff can wait a day or 2!<br>  When ur baby is up, spend some time with him laying down with him. Talk to him, sing him a song, kisses and silly faces.  Yuo have to learn to just forget about the world and focus in what is important, u and ur baby. When u feel like cleaning every inch of ur home while ur little one is sleeping, u should be sleeping. Always try to sleep when he sleeps. Turn the baby monitor on, put the other end in the bathroom with u so u can hear him, and take a bath or a shower and relax. <br>  ur not losing ur mind. u have a lot on ur plate and it shouldn't be like that. I'm sorry ur partner doesn't help out but that just means more love for ur baby. its natural for u to feel like this after baby is born. I was so over whelmed with emotion and exhaustion when my girl was born. I learned to ask for help (mother in law lived up the street at that time), I waited to do laundry so I could sleep for an hour or 2. u have to give urself a chance! this is just the beginning! <br>  good luck and god bless|`|Zew5sfbyaa	need to call your dr and get in sound like you have post partum depression or the baby blues you need to get on some meds to help you. Good Luck|`|AA11597153	Honey, sounds like you have a case of the blues.  It happens.  It is hard.  One minute your pregnant and anticipating the new bundle.  The next its here and you are like holy **** I am a mom.  Take it from a mom of two, it does get better.  If you feel any thoughts of harming yourself or your child please seek medical attention.  It really does get better.  <br>  Also when it comes to the commitment of your partner, kick him to the curb.  The baby is number one in your life right now.  You can do this.  Keep your chin up

KrdOKdJcaa	I'd say if you have specific allergy concerns, go to an allergist. That way you can test allergies out w/out worrying about his safety.    Cheerios are a pretty good table/finger food, too small to choke on. Anything small and soft that he can gum.|`|Aru7qaTjaa	In my opinion, babies don't need solid food at all for the first 9 months of life.  There is a reason God does not provide teeth for humans until then.  If an infant is exclusively breastfed for at least the first two months, and even several months after, God/nature provides all the nutrients the child needs.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Im not a mommy quite yet, but I was reading this morning about this very subject.  The book said to give your baby a little bit of it and make sure to pay special attention to any rashes or symptoms of allergies for a week.  If there is anything wrong, discontinue feeding that food and try again in a few months.|`|AA12243380	Check this site out... it was great for me!    http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com|`|pNP0qVJHaa	Try him on the meats now..Just grind them up first.Both my girls were eating solids at 6 months.As far  a finger foods you can give him bananas or Gerber cookies.Kids love those. You will never know if he is allergic to anything until he tries it.
Bw1h5xAcaa	7 and a half pounds is not that big, it's about average actually. And it's just an estimation. Even ultrasounds can be wrong by a pound or even more! There is no reason to believe you couldn't deliver vaginally. Women have delivered 10lb babies vaginally! It's not just the size of the baby, it's also the size of your pelvis, and even women with a narrow pelvis experience widening during pregnancy as a natural result of the relaxation and stretching of the ligament that holds the front of the pubic bones together. <br>  <br>  A c-section would be performed if baby was in distress (as observed by fetal monitoring during labor), or if the baby failed to descend into the pelvis completely enough to cause total dilation, if you had complications like heavy bleeding, or if you are pushing and the baby fails to descend (fetal - pelvic disproportion).<br>  <br>  You'll be fine, just relax and have faith in the process!|`|ioZeveazaa	I have followed alot of your questions throughout these past few months and can't believe it is finally time. I am 39 weeks and due the 7th. I am nervous to. I would not worry though about your baby and having him/her naturally because as long as your baby is in position you will not believe how well your body can accomodate the baby to pass through.  Your doctor will check you probably on ultrasound next time he sees you to see the baby's weight and position. However until then I would not worry and just let nature happen. It is going to be painful no doubt but your body knows what to do when it comes time. Just try to relax and soon you will be holding your baby. Good luck!!|`|0hR5hMquaa	7 pounds 9 ounces is not a large baby. That is a small baby still a healthy size. A large baby would be 9 pounds or more. I don't think you would have to have a c-section. You could always just be induced to bring on labor and yes have the baby naturally. I was 39 weeks pregnant with my daughter and my blood pressure was too high. so they had to induce me. I had her by vaginal delivery. Wishing you luck. By the way my daughter was born 7pounds 9 ounces.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I had my three pregnancies a decade ago and the size only mattered if there were other problems like breech or cord around the neck.  Otherwise, it would have to be a very big baby for them to consider a c-section.  Of course, I'm not a doctor and I don't know you.  Maybe if you are a very petite woman, they will take that into consideration.  Sometimes they also suggest a c-section while trying to give birth if it takes too long or they realize that you're not large enough to have the baby naturally.|`|AA10186411	Thats not a big baby.  Not at all.  Why are you only measuring 36 weeks?  Thats odd.  Anyways, you can still have the baby naturally.  Way bigger babies (I'm talking 9 pounders) have been delivered vaginally.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	7 lbs 9 oz is pretty average. Anything between 6-9 lbs is normal. There's no real way to tell how big the baby is until it's born and you can weigh it, unfortunately. Ultrasound can be off considerably either way, and you don't want to get talked into a c-section with a 'big baby' only to find out the kid was like 6 lbs. <br>  <br>  If he's measured you externally and you're not growing, it could be because of baby's position. They generally gain about a half pound a week towards the end but who knows. Growth slows down at the very end and they can actually lose a few ounces, I believe, just because they're running out of room. Aren't you trying for a VBAC? I can't remember if you're the same person or not, sorry ... <br>  <br>  Don't let him necessarily talk you into having a section right away, just because of size. I think I read in your profile that you were young, and not to be rude, but maybe your doctor is taking advantage of your youth to try and talk you into something like he knows your body better than you do. Do some research about it while you're waiting and try to relax and stay calm. While he is your doctor, he is not in control of your body, and you need to be informed before going into this. Having a large baby doesn't mean you'll have an emergency c-section - those are usually because the baby or you is in distress.|`|h93SVSxLaa	Your uterus seems to "stop" growing when the baby drops therefor you don't measure as big or about the same as you were. DOn't make yourself worried over these things. Make sure your bags are packed for everything...including 2 outfits newborn and 0-3 months sizes... although my daughter at 6lbs 9 oz was in a premie outfit anyway just relax while you can.|`|AA11661793	7lbs 9oz isn't that big. And ultrasounds arenlt always correct. They though my daughter was going to be big so I had an ultrasound done at 37 weeks with her and they said she was 8 lbs then ,but when I had her at 41weeks she only weighed 6lbs12oz|`|59GymH27aa	7lb 9 is really quite average.  You would definetely still be able to have a natural birth with a baby that size.   good luck with your labour and things|`|tmh42R6Caa	There's no way of really knowing.  I am 5'10" and I could not naturally deliver my 9lb 2oz baby.  He just didn't want to come out so I ended up having an emergency c-section.  However, my 5'1" mother-in-law naturally delivered my 9lb 15oz husband no problem.  Explain to your OB that you want to deliver naturally if at all possible.  She'll do whatever she can.  However, she may eventually decide that a c-section is the only way to go.  And to be scared.  It's so quick and you're so exhausted that you're happy to go into surgery :)
6UBSUzUIaa	Yes it's normal. Sounds like he is starting to get a cold and laying down at night settles all the mucus in his chest. You should get a humidifier to put in his room at night. Also, try some OTC expectorant. It could be allergies as well. I would take him to the doctor to rule out allergies and the flu. Just remember most OTC medicines are not allowed for kids under 4 now, so you may want to call a pharmacist and see what you cut the dose down to. <br>  <br>  My son, Andrew is 2 1/2. He's 37" tall, and 38 lbs, so we cut the dose by 1/2.|`|wHOQXToHaa	Yes, my son actually has the same thing right now! When he gets that way we run a humidifier in his room 24/7 while he is sick- it helps get some moisture in the air, it certainly helps him! Just make sure he isnt getting wheezy, croupe, or bronchitis (which can all show up at night!)|`|MhyuXBoEaa	it is because he is laying down and all the "junk" is settling in his chest.  When my son gets that way I give him Delysm and it works like a charm.|`|3ZNf4ef9aa	Yes. Its because when they lay down the mucus drains to the back of the throat. My Doc reccomended Delsyn cough syrup - ask your Doc first though!
RdMpPhhPaa	u get like 12 or 16 in a box... u can use a strip about 4 times (depends on how much hair u have) u just need to rub a strip (they come with two stuck together) u just warm them up by rubbing them with your hands... then you split them... nd just place them on you leg and rip it off quickly!  its really easy to do... they have instructions on the box if i ddnt explain it well enough :P|`|3tWRpNIZaa	Rub them to heat them. There are about 15 in a box. That's probably all you'll need. There are instructions to make it clearer on how to use them.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Think before you do it waxing yourself could be dangerous, painful, and scary.
nesRipENaa	What to Cook:   *Mac and Cheese (always a favorite)  *Turkey Sandwich  *PB and J with some apples on the side  *Heat up some oven/microwave pizza    What to Do:  *Play dress-up  *Give her a makeover (nails, hair, make-up, outfits)  *Make a cake/cookies with her  *Arts and Crafts   *Watch a movie with popcorn!  *Play hide and seek/tag  *Let her give you a make-over (they usually have a ton of fun doing this)  *Puzzles/Board Games    Hope I helped, Have fun!|`|r0ISrLc1aa	mac&cheese is always a favorite! you can just follow the directions on the box.     and for stuff to do, just ask her what she wants to do.    good luck! :)|`|MIUzgwsTaa	Maby you should ask her what she wants because I remember when I was 10 I used to be kind of picky.    Other Tips you may use:    Entertainment:  If she has acess to a computer take her to http://www.dressupgames.com (has alot of dress up games for kids her age)    Play hand games (like pattycake)    Make up some fun cheerleading dances    Make up a secret girl club or secrect handshake    Do hair (well let her play in your hair my little sisters really love playing in my hair even though it be a mess afterwards they still think it's really fun and funny to make me look like bridezilla lol)    Play hide and go seek (act like its hard to find her lol because I know my little sisters suck at hiding because they always giggle when I get near)|`|mYb674PPaa	Order a pizza or make mac and cheese..    Do her nails or make-up or hair or just ask her.    Hope I helped!
dfBjPB1laa	Personally I do not believe in the cry it out method.  Have you ever cried so hard you couldn't stop?  Remember how your eyes burned and your lungs hurt?  Also, why would you leave a little 6 month old there to scream and cry, when s/he obviously wants something, even if it's just to be soothed, and comforted.     Also, children who are responded to and taken care of when they start to cry actually cry less as they get older, they are also more happy and secure.     If you want to do the cry it out method I think you should suffer with having to listen to it.  It shouldn't bother you at all if you think it's the right choice...    Personally, I recommend you pick up the book The No Cry Sleep Solution.  It's fantastic, and much more humane...|`|UMRdHuuVaa	Sorry if i offend - but the cry it out method is HORRIBLE.  How would you feel if the two people you loved most in the world just let you there, upset, alone and afraid and crying - yet no one came to your aide???  You should, instead of drowing out the noise - get of your backside and see what is wrong with your child - then you might have a happier child - as opposed to sad and lonely baby who cannot fathom why their parents are abandoning them?  I think its heartless to use this method.
PFO1jxZGaa	Just turn it off for about 10 min at a time at first and get him excited about something else. Then in 10 min if hes bored and whiney let him watch a show and again turn it off for a while. Pretty soon he'll be without it longer periods.   My kids watch a lot too, it on almost all the time, either their shows or mine but very rarely do they actually sit and watch it. They might watch a part and then keep playing and hear a song and watch it and keep on playing. I guess I could actually turn on a radio...   Also depends what he watches.. If you have cable noggin and nick jr has a lot of good educational and fun shows and I dont feel quite so bad about having them on half the day. They actually learn stuff from them ( like colors, counting, manners etc) so if he watches crap then just tell him the movie broke and turn on more educational show :)|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	My 2 year old watches a lot to. I don't think its bad but I felt really bad about it to like I was trying to distract her with the tv while I did something else. I also have 2 that are close in age. (2and1) If you feel really bad try picking educational things for them to watch you know something they will benefit from.|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	As long as you are careful about what they are able to watch on TV, it will be fine.    When I was 3 years old...some 45 years ago, I used to spend many hours watching TV.  We only got 3 channels with the rabbit ears back then (actually only 2 channels, and barely a 3rd), but in looking back, it actually educated me...even watching silly shows.    I learned about pirrahnas, nitro-glycerine, jet engines, etc, just by watching some of the older sitcoms.|`|1h9DYByQaa	that reminds me of when my eldest daughter was young,  i had 3 kids really close together and i used to let her watch cbeebies whilst i was pregnant.. it got to the point it was on so much that i would have it on when she went for a sleep and then one day i went to turn it over when she was busy playing and she threw a hissy fit.. she has not watched it since and is now coming up 7.. she does watch tv as do my other children but they don't watch kids tv very often its more a reward thing in our house..    i would try to engage your child in some extra activity, like creative play or something to take his/her mind off the tv, and gradually faze it out, eventually you could limit the amount of tv your child watches in a day.. its not a bad thing to watch alot of tv some programmes can be quite educational. i do understand that being heavily pregnant putting the tv on for some peace and quiet can be relieving when you are feeling so tired, but try to engage in games and things to do.    all the best     mum of 4|`|28757f2f4e0a16804280db63ee65d074aa	No. your not a bad mother. It could happen to anyone. Start breaking the habit by occupying his time with creative assignments such as coloring, or puzzles. (things that help his brain develop).  A little tv every once in a while is not a crime:]|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Slowly ween her off.  Usually kids are happy to give up the cartoons if you replace it with another activity she likes.  Take her outside to play.  Have her color.  Read to her.  A little TV isn't too bad especially if she's playing while the TV is on.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Depends what your 3 year old is watching.|`|44OH7Si6aa	You aren't a bad mom. Sometimes we just fall off our game for a bit, but you are concerned so that's good. When he is watching tv or his movie, watch it with him, ask him questions about what you are watching and make sure it has some educational value. He needs time with you but that doesn't mean it has to be constant running around and physical activities. As long as you keep him occupied and interested instead of letting him go into the vegetative tuned out state you should be fine. You can also try some games like candyland and hi ho cherrio if you want him to spend less time in front of the tv.|`|jfwmelYgaa	No....My daughter loves to watch T.V, it's not like I make her watch it either.|`|k2wiYJAcaa	ween him into watching educational things such as sesame street or baby einstein. If he is going to watch tv atleast make it something educational|`|uu1IUxAkaa	who's the parent?  you or the Tv?  Did you have them so they can sit n watch tv?    go and spend time with them....|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	You are not a bad mom but watching tvconstantly is not good. We dont see kids outside playing anymore and kids have no imagination anymore. Try to teach him to play by himself. I used to always play with my son. When I found out I was pregnant with my second son I realized that he would be so upset that all the attention would be on his new brother so I taught him to play by himself. My kids are 14 months apart and play great together now and both do not watch tv. In fact my eldest son never really watches it up untill about a moth ago when I found hip hop harry he loves that show. We watch that every day at 10:30 and thats it. Try to shut off the tv and get him to play more|`|6izMqiBVaa	Have him spend some time on those little basketball hoops itl keep him away from tv for like3 hours.And let kids be kids if he wants to watch tv let him.|`|dQF5jOiLaa	Why would you be a bad mother for him watching T.V all the time.  It is his choice to do that.|`|xukz46NFaa	Your not a bad mommy no!  But your child does need some "you and him" time... i am a mommy of a 3 yr old and he watches alot of tv.  I do however for 1 hour when we get home after I work get together and spend time just playing what ever he wants... At bedtime I spend the extra 10-15 mins with him to let him fall to sleep with me there instead of the "let him cry to sleep" as most do.   I know working 40+ could kill ya and to come home to a little one, its tough but your not alone.  Just try to plan, dedicate at least an hour of time when you get home from work to just do something with him, even if only reading him a few story books before bed- you dont have to romp and get tired- just spend the quality time with her...  :) hope this helped      (edit)  I mean her, not him.. Sorry I have a little boy... lol|`|kjdKkDAkaa	Turn off the tv and play games with  him.  Give him your full attention.  when the tv is off ---maybe while the baby is sleeping. Do you have a back yard where he could play in a sand box with toy cars?  Could you take the children to the park -- some place safe where they could feed the ducks -- or a fish pond where they could drop bread crumbs into the water.  Just keep hold of them.
r52rfBkeaa	I don't think whole milk can cause this.  My suggestion would be to give the child milk once a day for a few days and see if her behavior continues or if it's just a fluke.  If it continues, stop giving her the milk and see if her behavior changes.  If it goes back to normal, then you know milk is the cause!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i have never heard of it before, but i guess anything is possible, see how she acts after it next time and see if there is a pattern to it..if so, at least bring it up to her doc at her next appt..|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Cow's milk is for baby cows. It is designed to grow a calf into a big animal. All of our children went from the breast to grain milks (rice, oat, etc.) They are teenagers now -- very healthy & smart. They did not get all the sore throats and colds and earaches that I did as a child, because of all the dairy my mom unwittingly fed me. Milk & hard cheeses cause the human body to create extra mucus.|`|claW4UUcaa	if her baby is under a year old she needs to take her baby off.|`|heDtLdz5aa	ETA: i am sorry...for some reason i thought it said something about 4 months old..i must have seen it in another question and combined both questions together...i am so sorry....i don't think that it could be why but maybe consult a doctor just to be sure...again i am sorry...|`|gRcVgmxVaa	If the baby was on a milk-based formula then probably not. If soy, then it could be a reaction. It's best to transition slowly over to whole milk (assuming the baby is at least 12 months old or if directed by a doctor).|`|I1ipTWLhaa	I don't believe that would be the cause if she's a year old.. i would say she's just a happy baby I would try giving it to her again and seeing what happens and to just to have piece of mind your sister could talk to your nieces pedetrician just to be sure...
23fDrmZoaa	it is 100% safe unless your doctor tells you not to have sex. With my first daugher i had sex my whole pregnancy. She was fine. Matter of fact a lot of doctors will tell you to have sex bc it keeps your muscles in shape and may even aid in pushing.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	it's not recommended, you can dislodge the babies|`|uiRdhx3saa	its completely safe as long as long as your doctor says it is. you should avoid sex if you have had any bleeding or anything like that, or if your a high risk pregnancy. and also you shouldnt lay on your back for long periods of time after the second trimester. it can put pressure on a major vein going to the baby.
hG8tLBSMaa	well you wont know till you take a test... i waited 3 days after i missed my period and i took a test... it was a BFP... if you still miss your period and test is negative... wait a week and take another...|`|AA11763588	Wait and see if you get your period. This is the first sign that you are pregnant.    Peeing all the time isn't an early symptom, that happens later on.    Eating constantly is not a sign of pregnancy.|`|7e86dc249e02eda2f37c61a8f9972f0aaa	peeing comes after your baby is big and pushing on your blatter alot...I would just wait for your period. If it's due tomorrow that is the reason your boobs are sore. Also another reason why you are hungry. I never stop eating teh whole week before my period starts..YOu are not pregnant!!!!!!
R0RnjdnXaa	Hi, I had a UTI last month and had to take some meds for it and it was a 10 day 4 times per day treatment. I too noticed I was leaking more than normal. I didn't call my doctor and just waited to see if after i was done with the meds the leaking would go away and yes it did. So I guess it's all part of the meds your taking. My discharge was also a bit more yellow than my normal urine color. Hope this helps|`|UiXJLrDWaa	well if you feel worried then calling the doctor it wont harm, go ahead and call him, you will feel better after.|`|pHAKN32yaa	<a href="http://www.drugs.com/mtm/flagyl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/mtm/flagyl.html</a><br>  <br>  I'm not positive about this but I tried to look it up for u and some of the after- symptoms of a new med.

AA10624857	I have been a licensed child care provider in my home for 21 years. Providing after-hours child care may be a good business as there are few daycare centers (except for in larger cities) or daycare homes that provide evening and night care. I don't think the cats should be a problem as long as you let prospective families know you have them. We have 2 dogs and 5 cats at our house and it is not a problem for any of the families I work with. The apartment situation would probably not be a problem for families, either, but you may want to make sure it isn't a problem for your building management or your neighbors. Extra kids have the potential for extra noise and not all kids go to bed willing or quietly. I have provided child care for several families where one or both parents were police officers. Usually I only provide care until 5:30, but I had one family I grew very close to who needed care from late afternoon until 1 in the morning. Both parents were police officers and sometimes had to work the late shift. When most of my kids were leaving for home, their little one came. She ate dinner with us and I put her to bed in the porta crib in the front room. I went to bed at my usual time, set my alarm for 12:55 and mom arrived promptly at 1 AM. Then I had to get up again at 5:30 to greet my first daycare children of the day at 6 AM. It was hard work, but I was glad to do it for them. Sometimes we had evening things to do such as visit friends, go to meetings, or attend our own children's activities. We let mom and dad know our schedule and simply took their little one along with us, like she was just one more of our kids. You'll need to also take into consideration that you'll have to find families where the parents can arrive from their own jobs before you have to leave for your day job. You will probably also want to check the daycare regulations in your state. Each state sets their own. Some allow a person to care for 1-2 children without being licensed or registered, but others are like my state, Michigan, which requires everyone who regularly cares for unrelated children to be licensed. You may initially have trouble finding people willing to bring their children to someone else's home for evening and overnight. I do know several families who need after hours child care, but all of them prefer to find someone who can come to their house so the children can sleep in their own beds. I had another family in my care where both parents were police officers. Sometimes their shifts took both away at night and they had a high school girl who came to their house to sleep while their kids slept. I really don't see any problem with offering this type of care other than finding the families who are in need of this type of arrangement.  ADDED:  As the provider it is not your responsibility to have a "back up" plan, but rather it is for your families to have.  If you are sick or you child is sick or you go on vacation, than you will just inform your families of this and they will need to make other arrangements.  In my opinion, a babysitter is typically a teenager or an elderly woman who cares for children on an occassional basis in a families home while parents go out.  A person who provides care on a regular basis in their home is a child care provider.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Sounds good to me. Most food-service folks needing nighttime daycare aren't going to be overly picky about the daycare locations and your cats. It's so rare to find a constant sitter at night, so I think you have a great idea here.    Good luck!|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I don't recommend you do this from your house. Why don't you work at a day care? Also, how much will you be charging? The normal day cares cost about 31 dollars a day. I think in general this is a good idea if you charge less then what other day cares charge. But will you be able to afford all of the food, toys, play areas and such? Parents want the best for their children, and at the day cares they have baking, paint areas, wet areas..etc. Will you be able to provide those?    Also, do you know anyone who is looking for a baby sitter? Because i don't think strangers will trust their children with you.     Have you taken a CPR and First Aid course?     You can't just decide one day you want to take care of a ton of kids. I am taking a two year program at college to become a day care worker.      I re-read what you wrote. You basically want to be a babysitter. All i can suggest is taking a CPR and First Aid course for safety. Find out if the children have any allergies, and try to have educational fun with them!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I think it's a good idea. I wouldn't be comfortable with the cats though. I'm allergic, and I'd be afraid that 1.my baby was allergic and I didn't know it, 2. the cat (though tame) would have some random moment where they scratched my baby and got him sick or took his eye out or something when he yanked its tail etc etc    I wouldn't worry too much about room, if you're babysitting younger babies.    I'd be more concerned with cleanliness and mainly you and you're attitude. I've been turned off before by child care providers who seemed too nervous and quiet, only talking when I asked a question. It's hard to trust someone you can't even get a feel for.     Good luck to you, it would be really nice if you can stay home with your child :)|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	To provide an IN HOME daycare you have to have a certification. That is someone will come in and take a look around to make sure everything is safe. Any issuses anyone has will be answered by that certificate. This also will help you get insurance. You will need to have extra insurance to make sure IF anything happens you are covered. Really you will be very close to loseing money once you get everything cared for unless you are charging enough. You are right to go for the service industry types as they have the hardest time getting daycare providers.    Question.. what happens when YOU are sick?  Question.. What happens if your child is sick?  Question.. What happens if you simply want a vacation?    I ask because you must have a backup plan. Those would be my first questions.. holidays, sick days, etc etc. Are you going to leave people in the lurch becuase you go on a cruise, or your child gets sick?|`|dfBjPB1laa	I don't see pets being an issue.  When my daughter went to an in home daycare I never had a problem with the animals.    Some people might have an issue with an apartment, compared to a house.  Some people won't.  I was going to get into providing daycare when I was pregnant with my son and I had people who were willing to hire me even though I lived in an apartment.    I think if you are going to be doing 2nd,3rd shift as well as possibly some weekends you should have no problem finding children to watch.  That is a crazy hard time to find someone to watch your child.  Most places do not keep children past 6:30 (at least where I live).  So I think that alone will out-weigh your other concerns.

Vaccinations are dead or nearly dead forms of the diseases they are designed to prevent...  Part of the vaccination process is the body building up antibodies against the disease the injection is for, fever is a by product of the bodies fight with the dead or nearly dead form which is how the antibodies are made... ...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you add roughly one degree to an underarm temp, but they can be less than accurate depending on the temp in the room, how baby is dressed, etc..call the doc or their after hours service and speak to whomever is on call and see what they advise you to do|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	motrin fever reducer and put him in lose pj's and no socks. but if it gets higher then go to the er or your local urgent care.    on another note:  i think i would look for a new doc. our doc is on call 24/7 we have called them a 3 am and they call back within 15 min. and yes the doctor herself calls back.|`|9Gd231Qqaa	I wouldn't be concerned.  The temp is probably from his shots yesterday.  Make him comfortable and make sure he is getting plenty of fluids.  If it starts to get to 103 or higher... your doctor should have an on-call nurse and she/he should inform you to go to the ER or not|`|Bw18seFqaa	call the hosp and ask if they think the baby should be brought in..  the fever may be from the vaccines, but its better safe than sorry.
54c33c2b2da66481bc77a67c47e5c81daa	To minimize ur risks for birth defects u need to take Folic Acid everyday. Stop taking any other medication unless your physician prescribes it. It probably will not cause birth defects. I do not beleive Klonopin and Ativan are teratogenic as they are addictive. But please do stop and take prenatal vitamins. This is the time that your baby will be developing rapidly. take care. Hope all goes well|`|X7fJjXFuaa	you should seek medical advice. of course they are going to give you a lecture about how you shouldn't be taking those drugs in the first place, but i think you are early enough along that if you quit now, your baby will be fine.    but please go talk to your doctor. he/she may also have other prenatal tips for you or maybe some vitamins.     if you don't have a regular doctor, you can go to your local planned parenthood for pre-natal treatment. they are medical professionals and are there to help you have a happy, healthy pregnancy. they charge on a sliding scale basis (pay what you can) and all visits are confidential.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Though not smart to toy with babies, I know that's not what you were doing.  Babies are extremely resilient.  Obviously you have stopped the excess medication by now.  The best thing you can do is to start prenatal vitamins.  The folic Acid in them is what fights off birth defects especially at this stage.  Another thing to start taking is some extra Vitamin C it will boost your immune system and the baby's.  My last bit of advise to you is to look for a midwife rather than a doctor.  They are very knowledgeable, more so many time than doctors and will give you all sorts of help to keep you and baby healthy and thriving.  You will actually feel like your monthly appointments are useful and helpful rather just a bunch of unnecessary tests, you will also feel much more involved with the birth and the experience as a whole will be much more satisfying.  Good luck, congrats!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	your early and i know people say taking stuff in the first few months is the worst but i dont think you have much to worry about i know people who did drugs all through there pregnancy and there kids are just fine|`|WkaWSKNAaa	Your doctor is the most qualified one to ask that question to.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	Benzodiazepines are categorized as class D, which can cause serious birth defects. Talk to your doctor and stop taking them if you still want your child.|`|fHgbL046aa	I am sure things will be okay but please speak to your doctor and maybe go on different medication.   My medication was cut down to 50mg from 100mg. I was thinking of trying different medication but afraid to. What if the different medication is worse for the baby then the ones I'm on. I too am worried because I have to get a amniocentesis on Tuesday. They found abnormal results in my blood work. Now I wonder did the medication cause this or my constant worrying.  I've been having a bad feeling about my pregnancy from the beginning.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Def. talk to your Dr. and let them know. A good sign is the fact that you had an ultrasound and the heart was beating strong.     Klonopin and Ativan are both a category D in pregnancy. Which is the scond to the worst. Pregnancy Category D is given to medicines that have shown clear evidence of risk to the fetus in studies. Category D medications are still given to pregnant women, when the benefits to the mother outweigh the possible risks to the fetus. The Dr will always look out for the mother first. If she has to have the medicine to function, they will give it to her no matter what the risk. Animal studies have shown these medicines increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects such as cleft palate and limb defects when taken in the first trimester. Human studies have shown that the risks of birth defects to the fetus were much smaller. When taken in the third trimester, both studies showed a risk of dependency in the newborn.     Your 20 week ultrasound will be able to tell a lot more than one this early. I would def. stop taking the medication now, if possible. If you must take the medication, take it exactly as prescribed.|`|lCYwqfHOaa	Be Unique about the spelling of Isiac..... power to you MOM!|`|u2kJE70Paa	go see a dentist.|`|NaENZSJRaa	iam haveing a kid to and dont bet ur self up u didint no u wear pregnant right. and the baby should be find i would ask ur Dr tho|`|7iPTUVrOaa	The best thing for you to do at this point (before it's too late) is to go talk to your doctor. Be completely honest and they will put you on the right track. Since every month is critical for the baby's normal development, you are better off completely staying away from any of those drugs...but i'm sure you already knew that...
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	If you want to have a baby by yourself I say do it. If you are financially sound and you think you can handle it then do it. I personally don't think you have to be married or have a father around to be a mother. I can understand your families fears, they don't want you to feel alone or overwhelmed. But in the end if you feel you can do it and you don't feel the need of a man in your life I say go for it. Best of luck and I hope it works out for you.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Adoption, definitely. There are too many children already on this planet without a loving parent, and if you have the inclination and the means to open your home to one of them, doing so is one of the most generous and beautiful things you can do.|`|EitNmbUNaa	I think that's great.  Good luck!  You definitely don't need to have a man in your life.  The most important thing for a child is having a loving home.  In my opinion, the easiest and most affordable way to go about this is through a sperm bank.  You can get away with spending very little money on this if you go about it the right way.  You want to use a home ovulation prediction kit so you can find out when you are ovulating and then get inseminated.  If you use a fertility clinic to have this done, it will cost a great deal of money.  Try the ovulation prediction kit I used-it was recommended by my RE when I was working to get pregnant.  It's OvuSponse (http://www.ovusponse.com )..  It's cheap, it comes with nine test sticks, and it can be ordered online.  Good luck!  I hope this helps and I hope it works out for you.|`|IVSqQQzlaa	If you can afford it, why not?  Since you are already a single mother you know what is facing you.  If I had not already had children by the time I was 30 (or wanted more and didn't have a man in my life) I would have went ahead without a man for sure.  I would buy sperm but have it done by IUI by a doctor - no need for IVF I wouldn't think.    Good luck! :)|`|29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	You could always go with a known donor.  Someone you know and trust is best, and you have them STD screened.  You  don't have to have intercourse, you can just inseminate yourself.  I know this isn't a popular answer, most people think there is something wrong with it either morally or ethically.  I talked to my doctor about it and she wasn't surprised, she said she had several patients who went the same route.  As for being a single parent I applaud you.  I was raised by my own single mom, and she did a great job.  I never wanted anything to do with my father, I'm happy and well balanced and see nothing wrong with it at all.  It's amazing to me that someone can be so supportive of a widowed mother, but then put down single mothers to no end.  What's the difference really?|`|SUBqk9WQaa	I am going to have children as weel. But that doesn't mean I need to have a man.  I acually plan on being single:)  And I commend you for doing so as well.  As far as I know adoption costs more. I think you should go for it. It is your choice what you feel comfortable with.  I wish you the best of luck!!!!!!!
c55O7jqXaa	Well the ADHD is normal for children with this disorder. The behavior problems are due to the ADHD and not the disorder within itself.     One thing you are doing right is seeking treatment. You can also get help from the State for his schooling.     You should be able to get a Teacher to come in and work with him one and one. Check into the Charter school system and see what they do for kids with disabilities.     Also e may benefit from Special Ed at a school. Some schools have better programs than others so do your homework and find out what would be the best route for him.     If you feel you cannot control him then he would be better off to get into a program that have trained staff that will work with him and his behaviors.     I do suggest medication if he is out of control. Meds really do help them to calm down enough so they can sit and listen for short periods of time.   ou have to do whatever it takes to make life tolerable for everyone at home and those around you until you hit on things that work.     I say what is it hurting to call him a different name if it works around the house. I say pick your battles. Think about if it is really worth it to waste your breath on something or is he is dnager of hurting himself or others?     It is not easy to deal with a child that is out of control and doesn't want to listen. That is why he needs constant consistency and lots of attention. This is not going to be an easy road ahead, but you can get him to a point where he is managable most of this time.    I wish you the best. Please seek every avenue you can for help. There is plenty out there and the doctor will also help you in giving you some ideas on what to do.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	If i were you, i would put him on some medication to help his mind, so that he can be at peace, and so will everyone else. Going to a psychiatrist is a great idea, because they will figure out if anything else is wrong, and it will give him a chance to vent.|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	No psychologist or psychiatrist will take away this little boys pain that he is experiencing. Sort out the pain first then the brain will be happy. Because he is only 7, he still has a life time ahead of him with the pain associated with his medical condition. To much emphasis is put on the ADHD and not on what is really troubling this little boy, pain.  My dear, talk to your treating Doctor and ask him/her for help in pain management, not the psyche's who will insist on shoving Dex's down his throat. Best of Luck. God Bless. My Love to your Son.
NNwEuC8paa	Oh My Gosh!!!! The other day some lady said something to me about saying baby dancing, she was REALLY rude, we ALL use baby dancing, and another thing...I see girls that are like " why do people always come on here asking if they are pregnant or what this means, what that means." It's like listen lady that is what this site is for so get over yourself! Hun I completely agree! do not let anyone get to you just talk to the people that make you happy, add me to your contacts I'll try my best to answers your questions and help you whatever way I can Good luck! Tons a baby dust! and keep up the BABY DANCING!!|`|9yz9V0j7aa	Because they're all idiots/trolls who have nothing better to do! They annoy the f*ck out of me. I use the term baby dance too!|`|YrsiSjNVaa	I know wot u mean, anyone who is ttc knows wot bd means so i wouldnt let people get you down never mind it!!<br>  <br>  There will always be some people who think there wise with their silly answers xxxxxxxxxxx|`|HCmAoNjzaa	I couldn't agree more! We ALL say baby dance!|`|ACTa6N5Naa	Hey I think some people have nothing better to do but to be honest most of these people are just loosers.  Its hard though when you have asked a question that you really need an reasonable answer for and idiots just post the most pointless rubbish!! I totally behind you on this one and I call the baby dance too!! I know I am here for the support and I try my best to answer questions as best I can.  So for anyone that isn't on here for these reasons should just go somewhere else!! Keep smiling!!! OH and baby dust xxx|`|6lKbDEFDaa	F*'em in the A! LOL...who cares what they think. While there are some ppl that are just looking for a laugh, there are others here that genuinely care and are here to support and be supported. <br>  <br>  on the BD...lol, when I first joined (monday) i had no idea what that meant, just eventually caught on! :)  best of luck and BABY DUST! TTC'er|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	no everyone says something mean<br>  & 2 somethings may be misunderstood bc they are being written & not spoken<br>  <br>   i personaly wouldnt say baby dance bc i dont know what ur talking about lol|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I've never heard the term baby dance but I'm going to use it all the time now. Just wait til my husband gets home :)|`|0upnZ6hSaa	I agree!  Hang in there.  It will happen for you!  BABY DANCE away!|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	I agree completely!!!  There are alot of immature people out there who should not even be on the TCC section because they have no idea what the terms we use are.  If they were really interested, they would look up the terms or figure them out.  I was a little confused when I first started ttc, but I found the terms really easy to figure out.  So, I really don't know why they feel like they need to answer the questions, except they think their answers are funny and they want to 2 points.  Happy Baby Dancing!!!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I know, I hate when people post stupid answers that make no sense or are mean. Its so annoying.
23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	I had the sippy cup available after about 6 months and let my child decide when it was the right time for them...     My oldest got the hang of it at about 9 months and disposed of her bottle completely about 13 months..      My middle child got the hang of it at about 8 months but didn't want to relinquish the bottle until about 2.5  years (We joked about needing to disguise the bottle so he could attend kindergarten with it... we only gave him water in the bottle after 12 months everything else in sippy cups)..      My youngest got the hang of the sippy cup at about 8 months and threw the bottle away almost immediately...     When you get rid of the bottle completely reduce your used stock to only 1 bottle (put the rest completely out of sight somewhere you child doesn't know about)..  Have a talk with your child about throwing the bottle in the garbage when they are ready..  When they are ready go out to the curb (or whereever your trash is picked up) on trash day and let your child throw the bottle away on their own...  Wait and watch the trash collector take it away with your child... (Wave good-bye or whatever your child wants).. So they know it's gone...     I did the above ceremony with all three of my children later in the day they each asked about the bottle, I reminded them we waved good-bye to it and the trashman took it away...   They easily accepted it , gave the trashman a few dirty looks over the next few trashdays, we were onto sippy cups and then regular cups...|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	six or seven  months and try holding it for her   try sippys with handles|`|1Si9RlEXaa	My baby is breast fed only and she is 5 months old. I just started letting her play with her sippy cup, and she loves it. She will try to drink out of it on her own. It is a nuk one with a soft spout. I think your baby is more then ready for one. If she is sitting up really well then she will be fine. But every baby is different. If she doesn't like it then try again in a week or even let her play with it for a bit. I am trying to skip the whole bottle thing for me and I think I just might be able to.     The nuk one I have is for 6+. I let my 5 month old use it. She really doesn't drink more then a 1/2 and ounce or so because she is breast fed only, but she is starting to get the hang of it.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	I have given my daughter a sippy cup at about 6 months with some water in it but at 9 months she still doesnt drink out of it, she just plays with it, and drinks water out of a normal cup|`|FLpMShKNaa	I think it is fine, but I wouldn't sweat it, either. I tried around that age, my son never would drink out of a sippy and went straight to small cups around 8-9 months. Many parents have luck drinking out of a sippy in front of their babies to make the baby want to, it didn't work for us, he wanted big boy cups.  EDIT-I ended up doing what Mrs. B, below said because we tried every type of sippy in the world and our son hated them all-he also hated bottles. So, I think sippy cups are fine, but going straight to a regular one has been great for our son, we sue the plastic 3 oz. dixie cups and wash them out-sure he needs a bit of help holding it for now, but it is temporary. She is providing an alternate view and doesn't deserve the thumbs down for it.|`|gcV4CJrraa	Why a zippy cup?  If you want it to be an extension of a bottle then do it now.  I could never see the use for them.  Parent's give zippy cups thinking the kids are using a glass.  If your child is sitting in a high chair & you are feeding him/her then why not put a small amount of liquid in a small plastic glass & help them drink by only allowing a small amount go into their mouth.  They will soon get the idea.  If you start out with a small amount in the glass & then take it away they will soon get the idea.  I had three kids, they never saw a zippy cup, they learn very quickly not to tip over their glass & life was good.  If you want their drink to be a baby sitter while you a driving in a car or doing house work then give them the zippy cup.  I think it is a rather bad habit & only an extension of a bottle.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, i started when she started solids, but so far the only one she will even put in her mouth is this cheapo one that doesn't have a valve even; she will suck the water right out with no probs, but wont even try one of the million varieties we have in the cabinet...so i would start with water when they start eating solids, but don't give them much and make sure they are still getting all their bm or formula; and don't waste time putting anything but water in the cup until baby is willing to drink from it..gl|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My pediatrician said we could start giving my son water in a sippy cup at meals when he was six months old.  She said not to expect a lot, and lol, it's true.  Most times it ends up on the floor.    However I've tried a few different cups and he's starting to get the hang of it.  It's a long process so I think starting at 6 months can't hurt.  Because it's not actually like he's drinking all that much water, he's just getting used to the idea.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	We started at 4 months because our son won't take a bottle. He just started to really get it recently, closer to 5 1/2 months. Just give it time, i don't think it matter when,you start, as long as you don't push it. they'll get it when they get it.|`|oIFMohfUaa	I think that right now is the perfect time!  Try it for juice instead of formula.  That way when you wean from bottle she'll go right to it.      You might need to help her, same as a bottle, until she gets the idea.    You might need to remove the "non drip" part at first, til she realizes that there is something in the cup.    Don't fill it full at first.  Just a little so it's not too heavy.    Good luck!
zhJOZhKEaa	Yes you can.  Slimfast isn't dangerous to the baby... the only real concern is losing weight too fast which can cause a drop in your milk supply.<br>  <br>  I have actually used Slimfast for weight loss while breastfeeding.  If you follow the recommeded diet on their website (which does include an option for nursing mothers) and keep an eye on your milk supply... it should be fine.<br>  <br>  ETA:  When you register on the site it asks "Are you breastfeeding" ... if you answer yes it puts extra calories on your diet plan.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I do. I enjoy the taste of it, I don't use it for weight loss. (I use to, not anymore.) I drink it, have some fruit or cereal and I'm good for breakfast!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Im sure it would be fine I would read the back of it and see what it says.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can use meal replacement (diet ones, or the extra calorie ones depending on your situation) as part of a balanced diet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/404_are-liquid-diets-safe-for-new-moms_4597.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/404_are-liquid...</a><br>  If you're breastfeeding, though, you'll want to use meal replacements only to provide a healthy option when you need a quick snack or an occasional quick meal (no more than once a day). Relying on liquid replacement meals more often than that won't provide the calories or nutrients you need for your own health or for nursing.<br>  <br>  Many women turn to meal-replacement shakes and bars because they're so easy. But you can create your own long-term eating plan by making menus so you don't have to think about every meal as it comes. It's even possible to incorporate fast food into your diet and still make it work. And if you like the shake idea, toss 1 cup of frozen fruit and 1 cup of vanilla yogurt in the blender for a delicious, healthy option.|`|113FoyMFaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Slimfast is a really good drink.  It's more like a health drink, with a controlled amount of calories.  It's pretty much the same things as Carnation instant breakfast.|`|dLadxEJSaa	Slim Fast will not enter your milk supply. It would be the same as eating or drinking any type of other food.<br>  <br>  Even alcohol is fine in moderation when you are nursing.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	I don't see it as a bad thing if that's all your taking just one can a day, They just want you to have the best intake of vitamins everyday so your baby is getting what he or she needs. Its def a parents call. I think if you eat a good size breakfast and lots of veggies at dinner a can of slim-fast in the afternoon shouldn't hurt. Its also that if you don't give back what the milk is taking from you, you will get very tired and run down. hope this help.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	why would you want to??  If you want to lose weight try exercise!  Remember everything that you eat and drink your baby can get some of that through your breast milk.|`|Vebih4H7aa	err i dont think u should really ive looked on slimfast website and theres no advice abt breastfeeding mothers at all so maybe u shouldnt. make fruit smoothies instead !!!!!!

Good Luck!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	no every pregnancy symptom is the same sometimes my boobs feel painful to the touch other times if they get squeezed it hurts it doesnt mean anything. With my daughter I had all my period symptoms including the cramping I swore that it was coming and 3 years later am stil waiting for that one to show...with this one the same thing and am 14 weeks. Dont worry its normal.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	Are you possibly constipated? <br>  You didnt mention any spotting or discharge. So I think you are good.<br>  It could possibly be your inside stretching and moving around to accommodate the growing uterus.<br>  <br>  You can always call your doctor/nurse and tell them what you wrote here.<br>  I call mine all the time with the silliest questions ever, just to have them tell me I was constipated or needed to eat more.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Everyones symptoms are different as far a breasts go but the period like cramping that you are having is completely normal in early pregnancy it is just your uterus growing and expanding getting ready to grow a baby|`|UzqYQf0Jaa	your gonna be fine after  it's all over your gonna be sooo happy that you have a child|`|AA10953561	Honey, you're fine! It's normal to have cramps during pregnancy. Sometimes it'll be just little twinges other times it hurts worse than your regular period like cramps. As for the sore breasts, they aren't always really painful. Mine didn't get sore or hurt until I was 15 or 16 weeks pregnant. <br>  <br>  Did you go see your general practitioner or did you go see your OB/GYN? If it was your general practitioner then you need to set up an appointment with your OB/GYN. They'll set up the blood work that needs to be done and do a pelvic exam to check how things are progressing. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're drinking plenty of water and taking prenatal vitamins. You can get a big bottle of vitamins at Wal-Mart for about ten dollars, and it'll last you pretty much the entire pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions feel free to e-mail me. Good luck, hon! Congratulations on your pregnancy!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	everyones pregnancies are different so your boobs might not hurt that much.  you should fee lucky.  As for the period pains, I'm 27 weeks pregnant and I still get them.  Its your body changing and your uterus growing.  There's not much to worry about unless you start bleeding heavily.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Our doc said the cramps were normal because of the stretching and growing going on & nerves involved. She said not to be concerned unless it's like your doubling over with horrible pain. You still have plenty of time to get symptoms and remember that every ones are a little different.|`|fgK1zOSiaa	Every pregnancy is different you may get some but not all of the things you have heard about from other women.  The cramping sounds normal to me as it is not severe. Oh and stop poking your boobs!|`|8eGrFwXQaa	It's all normal hun, don't worry just get used to it... it will get worse as time passes.|`|8lpGsCitaa	If you are really concerned about the pain, I would suggest calling your doctor and letting them know. There is going to be pain from the stretching in your abdomen (called round ligament pain), sometimes that pain can be sharp and feel cramp-like, but it isn't anything to worry about.<br>  <br>  I'd say unless it gets worse or you begin to spot at all, just wait until your next appointment to bring it up...but you can call the doctor if it will help put your mind at ease.<br>  <br>  As for the breast pain...it varies from woman to woman, just like everything else in pregnancy. It will probably be different for each child you have as well. Mine have gone through phases...early on they were very tender, but then that went away and lately they've been getting sore again because milk production is starting to kick into gear. It all depends...|`|UkQuMykiaa	Oh my gosh - you sound like me!!  I had the same worries.  Just to let you know I gave birth to healthy twins 4 weeks ago - so it is very normal. I had period like cramps through my entire pregnancy and worried every time. And the breast soreness - it will let up in the second tri - but I was just like that - if one day it felt like they weren't hurting anymore I would have to poke them just to see if they were still sore and then I would worry that this was a bad sign because I just couldn't feel them hurting on their own.  I will tell you all the worries made for a long pregnancy - but I am sure you will be fine.  Good luck and congrats!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	With my other pregnancies my boobs hurt like crazy! Then my other pregnancy it didn't hurt at all. It varies. The ones that had my boobs sore, I actually miscarried. And yet, lots of women are so worried that they are not getting the same symptoms as every other women. Even having those symptoms I still lost mine.<br>  <br>  I just want to point out that I've read somewhere that if you've had LOADS of symptoms and it abruptly stops, then you may want to speak with your doctor to see if everything is still ok, or, did somethings change.<br>  <br>  Ok re-reading what I post it sounded so bleak. With this pregnancy, I was cramping and I was in total panic. I thought I may be miscarrying again and after 2 miscarriages I felt like my world was going to fall apart. Not to mention my husband was deployed in Iraq for 15 months. After a week of cramping I finally forced these doctors to see me and give me an ultrasound and lo and behold, my son was there.. with a great heartbeat. All that worrying for nothing! I was then told that cramping is normal as long as it is not accompanied by bleeding, even then, some women carry their pregnancies to term! Relax and congratulations ;)
7ZTlktMeaa	Haha. I'm 32 weeks today & I hear ya!! I am VERY tired & lazy myself. I had a huge burst of energy in my 2nd tri & I started going to the gym, walking all the time. I felt great, looked great & had so much more energy! I thought for sure I would have kept up w/it throughout my entire pregnancy. But the last month I have been the laziest I have EVER been in my entire life. I wanna say even lazier than in my first tri, which is hard to beat, because I was so sick the whole time. But I think we both will definitely get outta this funk once our little ones arrive!! : ) I wanna fit back into my jeans... & actually zipper them!!!!   I'm sure this is normal! So, don't worry about it. If you were fit to begin w/, I'm sure you wont have much trouble going back!! : ) Let's be optimistic!!! Good luck w/the rest of your pregnancy!!!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Boy I know! I was so worn out I didn't even want to get up off the couch to go to the bathroom. I worked night shift so that didn't help.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah I worked until this past friday but...darn I was hoping to do more.  Now I take my son out and stuff and do regular activity type stuff but no excercise.  maybe its the weather because where I'm at its soooooo freaking cold right now!|`|xOr67VDiaa	i was more active b4 falling pregnant, i was ok up untill the 6 month. (35weeks now) and now i just cant do anything, i cant even stand for 10 min to do the dishes, i have to sit down for 30 min to stand up and clean for 30 min lol i feel so lazy, but im so healthy i know im not lazy, im just pregnant, i run after my other 3 babies all holidays so i cant be that bad lol|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	haha well...im' equally as active as you shouldn't do more exercise if you haven't before and vice versa...i probably walk once or twice a week outside. that is enough for me. i am not overweight either..but I am VERY lazy...hahahaha ;-)|`|GIqACtxvaa	OMG!  I am the same way when pregnant.   This is my third pregnancy.  I am an avid runner when not pregnant.  I have promised myself at the beginning of each pregnancy that I would be strict and keep up my fitness level.  But then something happens,  and I just dont.  So I know exactly how you feel.  Maybe its just our bodies way of saying, "just relax and grow that baby, that's all you need to do".    I do know that after my babies came it wasn't long before I was out and moving everyday.  I wanted the baby weight off ASAP.      Lots of Luck!  Just enjoy these last few weeks of pregnancy and then hit the streets with your stroller .|`|xMy0QEvFaa	YES, all the walking around, and bathroom breaks and bending over takes so much out of me. plus the swelling doesn't help.    But I feel more and more like a mommy everyday.|`|6yYeCVQFaa	Oh girl yes! I sleep ten hours at night anymore which is so unlike me. I get so fatigued and tired doing the smallest things. I think it goes away after a while. Best of luck to you and your new addition in a few weeks.
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	It could just be that you had some left over blood from last month and your body is cramping because of it. I find that this happens to me from time to time and when my period starts I will usually experience brown spotting sometimes the day before my period is due. So if your period starts a day early, or you notice a lot of brown blood mixed in with fresh blood then this is the cause. Some times for some reason we just don't release it all and it can mess with our bodies. You could also be pregnant. Even though you are on contraceptive you can still be pregnant. Rare though so you are right to be thinking that is a really low possibility.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	When I was pregnant, I had cramps a few days before my period was due. It felt like menstrual cramps, but they lasted for days. My doctor said it was my uterus expanding with the baby. You could very possibly be pregnant.
6yYeCVQFaa	The tricky part about early pregnancy symptoms is that they mimic PMS symptoms. Darker nipples, mood swings and sickness are good signs but I have been told morning sickness usually doesn't show up until about 8 weeks into a pregnancy. Now every pregnancy is different and it could be that you are pregnant. My suggestion? Take a pregnancy test the week of your expected period. Best of luck to you hun!|`|iMULlxdgaa	I would just take the first response test to be sure.  But you culd be pregnant!  Especially if your trying to get pregnant...|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Your symptoms are related to both PMS and pregnancy.  Implantation can take up to 14 days, so it is a bit early for symptoms at this point, but some women are more sensitive than others and claim to have symptoms very early on.  I do believe the heartburn, however, is unrelated to either as I've never heard of it as a PMS symptom and it doesn't occur in pregnancy until into the 3rd trimester when your baby and uterus is bigger making it difficult for the esophagus to close itself off from the stomach which causes the stomach acid reflux.  But it certainly doesn't happen this early in pregnancy due to pregnancy.  All you can do is wait and see if you get your period.  If not, take a test.  Try not to stress out about it too much as stress can delay your period.  Also, if you believe you are pregnant, or really want to be, you can trick your body into thinking you really are pregnant and you will start experiencing pregnancy symptoms, (called pseudo pregnancy) even if you aren't pregnant, so try not to think about it too much.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	It's 50 50.  I would take a test to be sure.  Good luck!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	if you are having unprotected sex, its possible your pregnant. if you don't get your period, take a test. however, those are also pms symptoms.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	Hey hun,   there is a possibility that you are pregnant but it is still abit early for you too be having symptons, it could just be that you are worried about being pregnant so your body is creating false symptons!  Wait and see if you miss your next period and take a test ( sperm can live in "there" for upto a week when you are ovulating so there is a high chnce )   Good lukc love|`|SKJb6eLKaa	Quite possible..    Are you TTC? If yes, your mind could be playing tricks on you.  Wait until your period is late or due and take a test I'de say.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	it takes your body 6 weeks to get pregnant.   so anything before that isn't you being pregnant.

9CoTDEKVaa	It's the same thing with me, my boyfriend and I never use protection. And hes never gone in me either, but I'm sure when he does ejaculate in you when your fertile you will end up pregnant. For some females, it takes a long time to get pregnant because your body needs to be ready to carry a baby, so you really have to take care of yourself before you end up pregnant. At times, when a couple is trying for a baby, and the male ejaculates inside of the female, she may not even end up pregnant, sometimes it takes 2 months, 6 months, or even a year to get pregnant! If you really want to have a baby, maybe you should talk to the doctor, and maybe you should talk to your boyfriend about this? That's the smart idea. But, you do seem kind of young, maybe you just have baby fever?|`|jNqf8HtDaa	you still seem to be a little young and if you do want a baby you need to keep track of your period and 14 days after your last day of your period is your best day...  i would talk to your bf about it though before hand|`|iUYTvsPEaa	If he hasn't ejaculated in you, you won't get pregnant. It's SO incredibly rare for it to happen from an ejaculation outside the vagina.|`|uiRdhx3saa	i definitely wouldn't worry about it. me & my fiancee tried completely for almost 6 months and i never got pregnant until about 3 months later. its actually kinda hard to get pregnant|`|p3BEgabyaa	Hmmm thats unusual...So ur saying u would like a baby andd so would ur bf? Something is SERIOUSLY wrong! Well im rely sorry to hear but I cant make u pregnant.. but good luck. i have always wanted a baby boy or girl.|`|bgv0As0aaa	Hun my bf and i have been using the withdrawal method for two years now and ive havent gotten pregnant yet... So sometimes it works if the guy can control himself... If you really want a baby u should start actively trying... good luck xxx
vUAjf0t1aa	I know you don't want to wait, but you could wait until you turn 18. You won't be out of the house then, will you? I waited till I was 18 to get my tongue done. Once you're 18, your parents can't stop you from doing anything.    How about you ask your parents if you can just TRY it? Say "I know you don't want me to, but why don't you just let me get it done and if it gets infected, I'll know you were right and that I made a mistake."     AND THEN DON'T LET IT GET INFECTED and prove your parents wrong!!!!!|`|prqrQcd1aa	You know i had a friend that had her nose pierced, her belly button pierced and her tongue pierced all at your age... she is now 29 years old and has none of the piercings, she did not like them anymore once she reached a certain age.     I think you should wait a few more years until you are 18 and then see if you still want it done, once you are an adult they can't really stop you. They can now, because they have to sign consent forms for you to get it done.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	okay my advice to you is i wanted this when i was younger but i honestly just waited till i was 18. i know that's not what you want to hear but just going and getting it done is really immature and you should show them you're mature by waiting. The other good thing is maybe you'll change your mind and find you didnt want it as badly as you thought. hope i was of some help. But please wait you don't want them to think they can't trust you. another option is just drop it for awhile and see if maybe they will change their mind. maybe if you wait awhile and ask later you can tell them you decided to wait so you would be sure this is what you wanted and decided it was and ask again. you may have to wait. Ive had mine since i turned 18 i did mine(not recommending it go to proffessional) but it's nice to be an adult and be able to do something i want without getting into trouble and having to ask permission. i am 26 now and still have it done. i love it.|`|kqaDc64saa	run away from home..burn your bible..become a lesbian and get your nose pierced..join the circus|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I turn 19 in a week and my mom freaked out when I got my cartilage pierced; but I'm REALLY glad I did pierce it, I love it and I'm glad I did it when I was an adult; I wanted it done at 16 too but I felt better knowing that I could be an adult and do it. You might too feel better; and believe me two years goes by so fast. You don't have to live alone to do it eaither; you just go and get it done and no they can't make you take it out or do anything else. It's your body, remember that.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	How about you explain in detail why exactly you want to have a nose ring. That's a good start with your folks.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Just go get it done. The worst thing they can do is tell you to take it out.
6avKnzkoaa	You could well just be suffering from acid reflex/heartburn without being pregnant. You should get it checked out. My friend had that and was given medication to ease it. However, I would wait for a few days and test again if you are pregnant, or whilst youre seeing the doctor, ask for a blood test.|`|KozoNqpsaa	Heartburn doesn't usually occur until later in pregnancy, but then every woman is different!  Also, only a few weeks into it, you wouldn't be gaining weight due to the pregnancy yet, but eating more and lack of exercise might be adding a few pounds. Since the hpt didn't show ANY result, you probably didn't use it correctly. Buy another one, use first morning urine and make sure you follow the instructions. Too much or too little peeing on it, can throw it off. Call your doctor too!    Good luck!|`|CptGRMSlaa	Take Tums if the heartburn continues, or you can use Zantac.  Both are safe to use during pregnancy, but you can call your doctor to see what he suggests.  It sounds like you used the test incorrectly, as there would be either a postive or a negative result, so I would suggest buying another and reading the instructions to make sure you are using it right.

So I read the Gina Ford book 'The Complete Sleep Guide for Contented Babies and Toddlers' and began to put her down straight after I had burped her. If she began to cry when I left the room I didnt go back in until 10 minutes had passed then I still wouldnt lift her out. Within 3 nights she had got used to it and all is blissful for the moment.

Read a book, give him a bath and just relax...no playing!  Then feed him a bottle.  Make sure he has a clean, dry diaper and then take him to a dark room and rock him.  Continue to rock him til he's drowsy (not asleep), say goodnight, and put him in his crib.  If you decide that his bedtime needs to be adjusted, do it little by little until you have him at the bedtime that you want.
640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	Donating your eggs is a wonderful gift you can give an infertile couple. Donated eggs allow couples who would've never had a chance to give birth an opportunity to become pregnant and carry a healthy fetus to term. In addition, women who donate eggs can receive some monetary compensation. But there are many steps that you have to follow in order successfully donate eggs.    Make sure you fit the general criteria before you try to donate. Most donor programs require donors to be 21 to 35 years old, in good health, at a good weight for your height, have a regular menstrual cycle and with no known genetic disorders within their family history. Women who smoke or have drug or alcohol problems are ineligible. Some donor programs prefer that you have given birth prior to donating eggs.     Step 2 Do your homework. Most donor programs want donors that are local, so look only at donor programs close to your home city. One place to look for a donor program is with the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).     Step 3 Contact the donor company. You have to fill out a complex application. This application will ask about your family history, your ethnic and religious background, your schooling and your health. Expect questions about your physical characteristics and your interests.     Step 4 Have a medical exam done, usually by the donor program. The medical exam is invasive, and you will have a pelvic exam, a physical examination, a blood test, a test for sexually transmitted diseases and at least one (probably more) psychiatric examinations. If you have a sexual partner, he may also need to be tested for STDs.     Step 5 Sign a donor agreement. The donor agreement is different in each state, but in most of them you agree to give up any parental rights from the donated eggs and what agree on compensation. Have a lawyer check out this agreement to make sure you understand everything.     Step 6 Start the donor cycle after a couple accepts you. During the donor cycle, you will be taking many different fertility drugs, so you produce many eggs. You will also be going through blood tests and ultrasounds so the donor program can successfully harvest your eggs.     Step 7 Get your eggs harvested. Some programs use general anesthesia for the harvesting, while others use simple sedation. Be sure you understand how your eggs will be harvested and you know the pros and cons.|`|Bw18seFqaa	you wont be eligible until you've had children of your own.. that is one of the requirements for both egg donation and surrogate pregnancy.

vACBeHSfaa	You should bd every other day through the fertile time of your cycle.  I would start around day 9 of your cycle and go through day 20 since your cycles vary by a few days.    If you really want to know when you are fertile, you might try learning how to chart your signs of fertility.  By charting your cervical mucus, you will know when you are the most fertile and can more properly time intercourse.  Then, when you see your temperatures rise, you will know that your fertile time is over and now it's time to count the days until you can test.  If you don't know about charting, try a book like "Taking charge of your fertility" by Toni Weschler or learn from sites like fertilityfriend.com.  If you still need help, you could try taking a class in Natural Family Planning which is used to help avoid and achieve pregnancy by knowing a woman's fertility signs.      I was successful on my first cycle of clomid over 7 years ago.  Good luck!|`|kOcYkte7aa	The best way to know is to buy an ovulation predictor kit.it measures LH surge which is a hormone that is always present in your urine but increases before your most fertile days.That way you know for shure when to baby dance and you wont have to play the guessing game.Best of luck...and Best wishes.
Jswomud7aa	She is still an infant. I wouldn't worry about her "clingyness."     YOU are more of HER world right now than vice versa... Enjoy her infancy, it goes by so fast. Don't be afraid to hold her, hug her, cuddle or kiss her as much as you want!    |`|eMDnLUpqaa	You cannot spoil a baby, however you can encourage behavior. Encourage him/her to play alone. Put some stimulating toys in the room, Show the baby how to play with them, walk out the door with out looking at him/her. The baby will cry. Stand right out side the room door with out letting the child see you. After a little while the baby may stop crying and decide to entertain him/her self. It may take a few tries. Also I would let the child play with other children maybe like a play date or something if the child does not go to daycare. This should encourage the child to get interested in others. You can also leave the child with a good friend or family member for maybe an hour at a time (get some grocery shopping done) so that the child is used to other people as well|`|vnJG8UYJaa	It is truly difficult not to spoil (love) our infant children.  This is what we are supposed to do with a child of this age.  You need to give your child all the love you can give her.  Just remember that part of loving someone is encouraging them to learn new skills.  This includes some independence.  You don't have to leave your daughter for long periods of time.  You can start by letting someone else play with her while you enjoy a nice long bath or shower.  Make sure you are surrounding her with other people who love her too so that she can learn socialization skills.  Then when you have to leave her, you can leave her with someone she knows and loves.  This will make it easier for you.  Let other people help feed her and take care of her.  Love grows when it is shared, not smothered.  Of course she is your world, but your wold and hers needs to include other people.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Yep, you're making a rod for your own back and you're right. Welcome to parenthood and many congrats|`|kO65JfS8aa	Good - obviously she loves you and wants to be with her mummy. I didn't leave my daughter at all for the first 8 months. She is clingy but I know eventually she will grow out of it. In the last few months (she is now 15 months) she has gotten better on her own and likes daddy for play etc and clings to me when she is tired or hungry.   Just don't make my mistake and let her sleep in with you!! That is my only regret as now she won't go to her cot!|`|JP2h62qiaa	I am a fan of attachment parenting. I think that if your child wants to be held then they need to be held. You make your child see the world as it is so if you feel that holding her all the time is alright then you can lay out a blanket and some toys and get down on the floor with her to play. I guarantee she is teething. My son is REALLY needing/cranky when he is teething. It hurts so bad. I am lucky enough to be experiencing wisdom teeth at the moment and it hurts ALL day long. A Dull constant pain. Keep her mind off of it, by soothing her. Try Baby orajel or teething tablets and give her something cold and hard to chew on.  Lots of Hugs and Loves to let her understand that this is all okay. IT will pass before you know it, Trust US all on that:) Im sure you hear it a lot. Every body just needs that reassurance that it is going to be okay...So ((HUGS)) It is going to be alright. I hope you guys perk up soon:) Good luck and hang in there.
uOxfOxsDaa	think about whats best for your child you might need to scope out other areas and where you are living might not be best, there are other places, other jobs, better schools|`|01vXGO1xaa	In my bed.|`|eW5D8rKPaa	condominium. =) !|`|VemHKmkmaa	throw him in a foster home.|`|FVD1tpLeaa	Move to New England.  Lots are really good schools, and lots of really nice communities. Still cold, but not as cold as Wisconsin.|`|laVR7f1Faa	Come to California. Or better yet here is a town I just love. My sister lives their. It is Sand point Idaho. It is a safe town some snow in the winter schools good people are so friendly and the town is called a walking town. So check the place out you can go wrong all in all people there will help someone like you and your Son get on their feet good luck were ever you settle be thinking of ya
tpY9nXbhaa	well even if you don't see or there no blood please just to make sure the baby is ok go to a hospital that's near our open to check are just make a call cause you don't want to take any chances at all so just go to a clinic or hospital to make sure.|`|iMULlxdgaa	If you fell on your butt...its ok, even if you hit your stomach by mistake (like on a door or whatever, or someone bumps into it)  it wouldn't do too much,  your baby is in the most safely packed environment right now,  that package you got in there is one that UPS or any mail carrier would be proud of.  Its packed to hold the very delicate cargo that is the baby and so it can take a good amount of "accidents" from time to time (with in reason tho)  you still need to be VERY CAREFUL,  but it should be ok. If you did experience cramping or bleeding please go to the ER right away.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	no u'll be fine, u'd have to hit ur belly very hard to do any damage to the baby.|`|6yYeCVQFaa	I think you'll be fine.|`|CT3hTng7aa	it really depends on how far along you are.  If you are in your first trimester, the chances of you harming the baby are very slim.  As long as you don't feel cramping or have any bleeding, you will be fine.  You may want to call your doctor's emergency line just to be reassured.    Edit-I'm sure you're fine, but even though your doctor's office is closed, there is always an emergency number to call.|`|RKJIYTtJaa	As long as there is no cramping or any bleeding i think you will be fine. My sister fell on ice when she was pregnant and i now have a 2 1/2 year old niece! If you have any questions you can always call your dr. they are more than happy to answer any question you may have!
AA10250756	First of all, at your age there is no rush. You have a good ten years to have a child. Secondly, why do you want to have a baby with someone who has not made a commitment to you by getting married? There's nothing to keep him from walking away after you have the child and then you have all the work of caring for a child and working full time to support it. Deep down inside you know you are not ready to have a baby. You want to have some fun first before you are tied down for the next 18 years of your life. Also, you know that until your depression and panic disorder are under control, you are not ready to deal with a baby who may cry for days on end. When you are 27, then think about having a baby.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I think you should wait personally. Its good that you are financially stable and in a loving relationship, but you're young. I am 21 too, I could not IMAGINE having a child. Don't you want to go to college and stuff, or did you already graduate early?? I just think you should take this time to accomplish things in your life, once you have a baby your hands are tied.|`|nYnlYAE1aa	I am 27 and I have been with my hubby for almost 10 years now (married 1 1/2 years). I also suffer from depression and anxiety. We're taking the plunge and trying to conceive. :O) I'm trying my best to be brave about the whole situation.|`|xukz46NFaa	I think you should absolutely look into the possibilities!!!!!   Your 21 , stable job, hopefully about $5,000 banked for the first 3 years of childhood emergencies (diapers, clothes, etc)  I would say do it... 5 great year into a loving relationshhip....    The only thing I would suggest is that you seek some medical advice on the depression and panic disorder... Some pregnancies cause depression afterwards and this could set u up for a depressive state, maybe suicidal.  Just look into this, u might still have all the options in your favor, but I wouldnt not check this out first..  :) good luck|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	You can safely become pregnant and bear your child even if you take pills for your depression. Don't have a baby unless you are 100% sure you are able to handle the emotional stress though...having a child is not easy especially right after giving birth but if you really want it and you have a supportive partner, everything is possible. If you have learned to control your panic disorder, it should be fine! Although you can't completely recover from depression, taking care of yourself and recognizing this problem show that once you will be able to have your kids without having to worry about causing emotional harm to them.
RPszYGXkaa	I just bought a copy.  I hope it helps our TTC efforts.  Regardless it is a really cool book that helps you understand your body better than you probably did before.  It is a good read!|`|aeuWwrehaa	i got it from my local library and i loved it it is so worth it|`|NGhYFQnDaa	I read it as it took us 3 years TTC    I flicked through the book and it is good.    Im currently 4 weeks pg, i found out at 3+5    xx
eD0MVJxUaa	Yes, my daughter is the same way.  There's tiny short fine hairs.  She's blonde and doesn't have much hair either.  As she matures it will just turn into the awful coarse crap we all have to deal with.  No worries.|`|52FMZOTAaa	No! Ew! Why are you looking there!?!?|`|lQIKWXDuaa	wow. I did not know they have that. Interesting. Maybe it is because in my family they are born bald.    ss|`|10YksH8caa	if you didn't know, humans have hair everywhere on our bodies to help keep us warm, lol..|`|claW4UUcaa	yes they have fine hair all over their body. it protects their skin. same with adults.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yes I think that it is fine, we all have hair everywhere, was she born a little early? My son was born a little early and he had hair all over his back,shoulders, and some on his face. I'm sure she is more then fine|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Yes. Body hair on young infants is caused by hormones transferred from the womb. In the first few months of life a baby's body starts producing hormones, which can cause hair growth. Chances are it will be gone in a couple of months.
fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	i would suggest infant mylicon for the spit up problem my son did the same thing the medicine is for gas so it breaks up gas bubbles there for preventing the whole wet burps your probably getting.... breast feed baby poop is "seedy" i added a link for a pic of it... and a newborn i would bath her every two days because their skin is so sensitive and plus how dirty could she be... when she gets a month i would do the whole every other day thing and save the everyday for when she starts eating solids and getting messy... and the bouncer thing if its a basic seat doesn't really have support i would wait till she can hold her head better|`|202ff5e36fd233f7e4e10b9bde6c914daa	1. Maybe you should check your diet...are you eating alot of something really strong that could upset her tummy (onions, garlic, broccoli,etc.)? If nothing else talk to your doctor and her doctor to make sure your milk is alright and not what's making her sick.  2. I've heard all poop is okay except if it's red or black..but you need to tell her doctor about something like this too.  3. I think it depends on the baby...too much bathing can dry out their skin and scalp and make them lose hair. Every other day for a new baby I think is fine.  4. By bouncer do you mean like a kickNplay (where they sit/lay back and has music, lights or vibrating motions?? If so I would think that's fine for her age ( my son loved it at a month old). Or do you mean like where she sits straight up..I would think that at 16 days old she can't sit up, not really hold her head up and most likely cannot touch the floor or bottom of bouncer with her feet?!? I would say that is NOT okay.  I would strongly suggest talking to your pediatrician/calling if you have to and talking to other mommies for some advice.  Good luck and Congrats!!|`|wcYRxDw2aa	My daughter did the same thing she just wasn't breast fed, but the doctor said that she had reflux.  We ended up having to put rice in her formula 1 tsp for every 4 ounces.      I don;t know what that could be you probably need to take her to the doctor it might not be anything but then again it could be serious.      I was told to wait until she is 1 month old for that, there skin is too sensitive and you don't want to dry it out.      Yes!  My daughter loved it just make sure it is in a safe place and she is strapped in.|`|claW4UUcaa	it could be spit up. some babies have projectile spit up.    poopies should be yellowish with seed looking things in it.    it's not necessary to bath a baby everyday. every other day is fine.    the crib or bassinet is the safest but i'm not going to lie my daughters have slept in their bouncy chair a time or two.     congrats on the little one and if you are ever concerned call her pediatrician.
uOxfOxsDaa	of course my 17 month old loves the gummi bear kinds of vitamins sold in many stores|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	my 2 1/2 year old daughter has been taking vitamins from when she was about 6 months old. but this is what she has been taking from when she was about 1 1/2 years old its called My first Flintstones. and its 1#  Pediatricians' choice. i recommend this one. my daughter loves them. every morning she is always saying mommy mediation please as in her vitamins. good luck make sure you only give your child just one a day no more. <br>  <br>  or go call your child's dr and ask them.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	If she is eating right and getting all of her nutrients she really shouldn't. But if she is any kind of a picky eater or won't drink milk, then I would just to be on the safe side. You can always ask the pedetrician or a nutrisionist. My son (same age) does because he is a particular eater.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|zFgYaQ5Jaa	Oh yes, of course.<br>  <br>   A Multi-vitamin is only a supplement, its not a drug of any sort. I mean, its just like a Flintston vitamin, right? Just make sure you don't over do it with the vitamins, since too much of a good thing can be dangerous... [Too much calcium can kill you, as well as too much iron. So, use your common sense on what to give your small child.]|`|AA11024636	I give my 26 month old daughter a muti-vitamin being she does not eat very much and her pediatrician advised me to do so.  I but the store brand of the Flintstones and she hasnt had any problems with it.

Go see a doctor.|`|jrdtQi04aa	Sounds like you may be. I would see a doctor right away.  I never spotted when I was pregnant.  Also, my tests came back positive when I was.

To check if your pregnant here is a question: Have you had sex sometime around all this stuff?|`|9t8pJG5Caa	Is your period pretty regular?<br>  How long ago did you take the hpt's?<br>  <br>  The blood when you have a bowel movement (poop) seeing that you are constipated, sounds like small cuts or tears in your anus while trying to pass your stool.  That wouldn't have anything to do with being pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  If you took the pregnancy tests after your missed period, I would say chances are, you are not pregnant.  Pregnancy tests show positive if they detect hCG hormone in your urine.  No hCG = negative pregnancy test = not pregnant.<br>  I just think its highly unlikely that after taking 2 pregnancy tests, both being negative that you are in fact pregnant regardless of the other "pregnancy" symtoms.<br>  Sometimes when I'm scared of being pregnant, EVERYTHING is a pregnancy symptom.<br>  <br>  Best to see a doctor.|`|eMSP740Taa	Haven't had a period in 7 weeks and are experiencing all these different things?..Sounds like pregnancy is a definite possibility for you my dear!...Believe it or not though, sometimes when a woman is completely obsessed with the thought of pregnancy, your mind can actually overpower your body and you can actually cause delays in your period. This happened many many years ago, but my aunt actually believed with all her heart and mind that she was pregnant even though pregnancy tests said otherwise. Over the next few months, her belly actually began to grow! It was only when she went to the doc for a checkup on her "pregnancy" did they find out that she in fact wasn't pregnant at all! The mind is a very very powerful thing. Go make an appointment and tell them your problem. They can easily give you a definite answer by giving you a blood test for pregnancy. GOOD LUCK!! =]
ENANtueuaa	It's possible that you are experiencing implantation bleeding. Pregnancy symptoms and PMS symptoms are very similar, so it's possible that you are. Light bleeding during pregnancy is possible, but it's not a period, your period stops during pregnancy. Bleeding can happen for any number of reasons, one being implantation bleeding. Wait a few days, then test use your first morning urine. Good luck!|`|nFj30sZcaa	Absolutely.  My mother told me she was 5 months pregnant with me before she ever even expected it. She'd had her regular period every month and woke up one morning and felt a kick!  Yes, you can certainly still have a period while you're pregnant especially the first month and sometimes 2.|`|mjUqLKfLaa	yes, you could still be pregnant with period-like symptoms.  the best way to know for sure is to get a blood test done from your doctor!

I love Dorothy, but it sort of seems out-dated.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I like Dorothy.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	Dorothy and Lois sound a bit too old-fashioned for my style. They don't sound very fitting for a child or a teenager, and they just aren't really my taste. Helena, Emily, and Ava are all lovely names, although I'd probably have to choose Helena because it's beautiful and uncommon. Emily and Ava are both popular names, and I don't see Helena becoming super-common soon. Also, Ellie and Lena could both be nicknames for Helena, and I think those are cute. (:  I also like Avagail and Emilia - a bit like Ava and Emily (and both could be used as nicknames) but a bit more unique. But that's just me. I also like Helena Emily as a combo.|`|Re524Otfaa	Ava and Emily, definitely.

LJhrtN9Uaa	take cooler showers, i took like 3-4 a day when i was pregnant with the heat and eat ice chips... good luck momma|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	In the evenings, strip off as much as you can, get a flannel and dunk it in cool water, before patting it over yourself - this should help a bit.    40 degrees?  Wow, I sympathise because I remember freezing my poor husband to death when I was pregnant by opening every window and door, but we are lucky to get 4 degrees here in the UK.    Keep a steady supply of ice pops or ice lollies, cool drinks will also help, and make sure your ice cube trays are stocked.      When you go to bed, keep things cool too, so what if you have to sleep in your underwear, or the nude to do it - if you are comfortable, that's what's important.    Congratulations on your pregnancy, and don't worry, not much longer now, keep the iced drinks and flannels up!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I have been there ..I lived in Adelaide 3 years ago and had just had a baby..I was so worried all the time...have you got air conditioning?

I only went out when I absolutely had to.|`|jZ6Ptkafaa	ice pops eat them as much as you can, drink plenty of water and stay in the shade|`|i2ObfVJtaa	I would try and take a cool shower or bath.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	try been 8months in this heat....at lease u will give birth when its cooler|`|IurAMoIDaa	hi,    being pregnant certainly does come with certain discomforts!    as you are carrying you would lose certain nutrients as the baby is taking them, i would suggest drinking plenty of fluids and maybe eating foods that are high in starchy carbohydrates like a banana etc... as they release energy slowly which would in turn make you feel like you have a little bit more energy then normal.    as for the heat, i don't think you are going to get away from that!!
KkBQWSSMaa	no  not noticably.  you might "feel" bloated but no  you probably wont start showing til your 3 or 4 months on your part, 5 to everyone else.  feel kicks at about 16 weeks and hear heartbeat with the machine at 9-12 weeks.  morning "all day" sickness for 3-4 months  good luck! if its a girl name her bridget!|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	You may have some moderate water weight gain in the tummy area, but your uterus won't start expanding until the fetus needs more room..     The uterus is like a muscly balloon, a balloon doesn't expand unless the volume of air inside is to much for the current space inside the balloon... Your uterus doesn't expand until the volume of fetus and extras (placenta, amniotic fluid, etc) needs more room...|`|mMKayhNGaa	no theres no noticeable expansion, or size difference until around 4 months|`|lk4ulp69aa	well, the egg gets fertilized in the ovaries, (I think) then it travels down through the fallopian tubes and into your uterius.|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	it can take up to 4days for the egg to implant after it is fertilized. After that it probably takes around 4-6 weeks before it needs room and starts to expand. a woman will show around 12 weeks with her FIRST and in little as 6 weeks with her other children. But I have also known of a girl who didn't show until her 20th week.|`|9243ea0535f139ef664eccb335fe7179aa	yes sort off|`|M21c8MQ9aa	Your uterus will not begin to expand until the embryo grows enough to where the uterus has to stretch to make room|`|zif7kxswaa	no, not that soon. the egg has to implant, and it will probably be about two weeks before the expansion actually starts.

mPTBU0QDaa	Make them eat it. If they don't eat it, put it in the fridge, and when they come back and are hungry, re-serve it to them.    Not eating anyting you make is different than them not liking a particular food. For example, I never liked cucumbers when I was little. My mom wouldn't make an entire meal of cucumbers, but I always had to eat one. I couldn't leave the table if I didn't. It was an all-out battle sometimes, but definitely worth it, because I like EVERYTHING now.    If your kids hardly eat ANYTHING, then by all means, force them to eat what you made. Picky eaters will have a hard time getting balanced nutrition, and that is serious. Trust me, they won't starve. Sooner or later they'll choke it down, and then they'll learn to like it.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	if i had to guess, then    A)  you make something else for 'em, and    B)  there's enough junk food around that the eat just fine.    once you fix those 2 things, then they'll get better at eating what's put in front of them.  what i mean is,  who's in control?  you?  them?  it would seem that they are.  and the situation will get far worse if it doesn't get better.  food will be the smallest part of the problem.    mind you, i'd not be serving liver and okra.  but meat, potatoes, and veggies should be eaten.|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Here's the deal.  Don't try to punish your children for their likes and dislikes.  As long as they are eating healthy, everything will be just fine.    Children don't develop all of their taste buds until much later in life.  I recall from my own childhood that I preferred bland foods over fresh foods.  I prefer the green beans, corn, peas and other vegetables from a can - not fresh.  As odd as that sounds, it's true.  Nowadays I insist on the fresh stuff for my meals.    Ok, so this is what you do.  Find-out what they like.  Then, buy the things in TV dinners, microwave meals and canned foods.  That way, you won't have to slave in the kitchen for hours as the family short order cook.  Just tell them, "If you want chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy instead of what I am cooking, then fine.  Here.  Make it yourself in the microwave."    Just be careful that your kids don't get fat this way.  I used to eat this way as a kid and I did fine...but that was because I was full of energy and was always running around (like kids should do).|`|pDGVTLoFaa	make sure they get no treats until they eat their dinner they soon will when they are hungry.|`|4EnLDNE3aa	Ask them what they want to eat and adjust to meet their needs and what you can make|`|AA11537580	how old are they and what are you making?|`|MQ83HGD5aa	Tell them that they eat what you make or they will not eat at all. Tough love people!!|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Tell them that you are not running a restaurant and if they don't want to eat they will not be offered or allowed to eat anything else until the next meal.    Then stick to it and don't worry about it.    When they whine about being hungry then tell them "well you should have eaten when you had the chance".|`|MzHwklzKaa	Involve them in meal planning.    Take them shopping with you.  Have them pick out the different things.    Make, and post a menu on the refridgerator.  Have the children help you decide what they want to eat, write it all down and read it every morning.    Say, "This is what you decided on.  This is what everyone's eating and I'm not hearing anything else about it."    If the kids can't read, use pictures.  Kids as young as 3 can be involved in meal prep.    At the same time, limit snacks.  Make sure everyone's hungry for meals.|`|OAyXEtIoaa	man i hear you, been there. listen, this is what i did. for a week or so i would just cater to them, it was wasteful, but i would make sometimes 4 or 5 different things in one night until they ate, i started narrowing things down to the things they liked to get a base. then, kept with those foods as a staple, and every couple of days i would then just try new things little by little, until i built up a list of things they liked. i couldnt get them to eat veggies, so i would buy those juice boxes with fruit and veggies mixed in that they would drink, and bought gummie vitamins that consisted of differnt vegetables to get them what they needed in between meals, since the only things we could get them to eat were pizza, mac and chees, some fruits, cheese, pancakes or waffles, pretzels, peanut butter and jelly, crackers, oatmeal, etc. then once i had foods they would eat, i would make sure to buy the healthiest ones, like wheat bread and whole grain waffles crackes, etc. yogart drinks instead of regular yogart, whole grain pizzas, etc. it might be a little more expensive, but they are getting healthier versions of the things they eat. also, pediasure, vitamins, etc. are life savers. they are kids, they will eat when they are really hungry, and as long sa they are getting fluids, good juices and such, and vitamins to supplement their eating habits they will be fine. also, talk to your pediatriction, they have good ideas alot of times. there are some good books out there too!|`|BJERgbM5aa	Kids are great.  The are also experts at learning how to 'push mommy's buttons'.  They cooperate with each other in this endeavor.  They don't eat, mommy starts breaking down.  Let's them eating anything, as long as they eat.  Candy, Ice cream, pie, anything.  Yeah, they've got your number!  God bless them.  NEXT TIME, they don't eat. That's it.  Take the prepared food away.  Or leave it on the table.  Close the kitchen.  When they are hungry enough, THEY WILL EAT.  Guaranteed.  Sounds cruel.  It's not.  It's the only way you will regain your sanity and your status-quo.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Kids won't let themselves starve. They'll eat the food if they're sure it's their only option - so never offer them anything else for dinner and they'll learn to eat what you make!

8yDvL9sJaa	If he's eating mostly everything thats good! Don't force him when he's hungry enough food will go down. Experimentation is cool at this stage he's learning new foods and textures, have fun with it and don't fret over it. Let him feed himself he's 1yr old let him make a mess and feel his food, eventually he will be letting food go into his mouth and into his tummy! Lol :) might be a bit messy but he's learning too~    Aeroroot cookies are awesome! They're baby cookies which are hard but mush and get soft as he chews or gums on the cookie! Which will eventually help with pain when he starts to teethe!    Good Luck~|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	have you seen those things that have a little net attached to a ring and you put the food in it so they can chew it and not choke on big pieces? i looked at ours and they are made by munchkin but i dont know the proper name for it. maybe he would like that better or you could buy a food mill-you just put the food in there and grind it by hand. so he is still getting the flavor of table food without the chewing. hope the teeth come soon!|`|wSso1HsLaa	Baby food, mashed potatoes, or you can blend some food like bananas, and there's pudding.|`|savPsYWjaa	My granpa has no teeth.

LqtD1uS0aa	oh my gosh, this sounds exactly like what im trying to "survive" in. my mom and my older sister (my dad really isnt in the picture, so i think my older sister took that role) always are making me miss out on life. like they wont let me get a facebook as well, and they just let me get a aim. and they dont let me even talk to boys! i mean, i love boys, and they are all i ever think about, but i still get all a's in school. everytime i try to talk to a guy, i have to be worried that something may get back to them, and they will never ever let me talk to boys. im 13 right now, and they have been doing this for as long as i can remember. but i have an older sister (16) and she always gets to go out with her friends, and i just have to stay home doing school work or yahoo answers on the computer all day. its horrible! like theres this guy at my school that i really like, and i have liked him for two years, and sometimes we walk home from school together (but only like 3 times in 2 years) and i always have to cut the time short, because my mom and sisters basically stalk me, and they are like always watching. and whenever i talk to my best friend on the phone, they listen in! so if i want to talk to her about something important, i cant! and other times, my little brother will come into my room and listen to me talk on the phone! its really really horrible, and they (my mom and my older sister) dont trust me at all. grr, its really bad, but your life doesnt seem as tough as mine. i would love to be able to even talk to my friends (other than my best friend) outside of school, but my mom would never allow it. but i've tried so many things to try to change her mind, and i found that going to the super market with her, and then starting a pointless conversation (like: "i got a 95 on my science test") and then we usually talk more seriously (like having more time to talk with friends and stuff). but we havent yet talked about boys. but all i can suggest for you is that you try to talk with your parents, and tell them what you want. im trying it with my mom, and we are making slow progress, but theres progress made. i hope this helps, and good luck! (remember, im in the same boat as you, so wish me luck too!) |`|CiF80lwwaa	you should tell them that ur 13 and you should have more freedom in life. if that doesnt work, tell them that youll never get a girlfriend and will have to live at home till ur 50.
n6XYYyoLaa	as soon as she got frustrated with the pace of the slow flow...kept pulling away, obviously hungry, just mad at the bottle, LOL!  if u think she is ready, u can try it and if she doesn't get the hang of it quickly and is dribbling a lot of milk or gagging or aspirating, she's not ready....you could try a med flow; if you use standard size bottles, dr brown's nips should fit your bottle and they have a large variety of sizes...|`|TVC3mAP7aa	If you also breastfeed, it's recommended that you never switch to fast flow nipples.  Slow-flow nipples require them to work a little harder, similar to how they have to on the breast.      If you formula feed, I think it would be OK as soon as baby can handle it.  I'd just give it a try and switch back if it's too fast for her.  I accidentally gave my son stage 2 nipples a while back and it was very obvious to me that it was too fast for him.  He would cough and push the bottle away, which he normally wouldn't do.|`|3klIx1Egaa	the hospital gave my son a medium flow nipple, which he is still on, i have not tried the fast flow yet, because his bottles are already gone in 2 minutes, i couldnt handle 30 second feedings lol.

We introduced stage 2 when she was 7 months. But she still doesn't have any issues using stage 1. I think it depends on your baby and the particular bottles you are using. Go ahead and introduce the fast flow nipples, if your baby can't handle them you'll know right away lol.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I think the fast flow is too fast. My kids liked the medium one, but you know when to try a faster one when they keep getting frustrated while eating ( because they are not getting enough fast enough for them anymore)|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I have use the Dr. Brown bottles and they have 4 levels of nipples.   He used Level 1 from 4 weeks to 8 weeks, then was gettin frustrated cuz he wasn't gettin it fast enough so I started him with the Level 2 ones.  He started usin Level 3 ones by about 5 months old, cuz if the same reason.  I have yet to try the Level 4 ones, but he seems to be getting enough milk fast enough for now, so I wont try them til he tells me he needs to, lol.   Hes almost 8 months old now.  Id say if ur baby is getting mad at the med-flow nipples, or fussin more at feedin times, then Id try the fast-slow ones to see if that would help.  But I dont think most babies can handle the fast flow nipples til around 6 months old or more, and some never really need or want them.  Hope this helps, :D.|`|F2RFHOmjaa	I have tried a fast flow nipple at about 6 months old and always found that my child would choke.  I like the med flow, and it allowed him to take his time when feeding.

If these kids haven't seen your son's toys, they're going to want to play with stuff they've never seen before.    * If you have the space for it, get a small parachute (I think Target has started carrying these; otherwise look for a Teacher's Store) and some plastic balls like those in a ball pit.  Whiffle balls, foam balls, etc.  will also work.  Kids love to have the balls on top of the parachute and bounce them up and down.    * Green light/red light    * Little Sally Saucer    * Movement songs (Itsy Bitsy Spider, etc)    ----    Quiet games:    * puppets  * floor puzzles  * one or two craft activities     - you can find edible play dough recipes online    - sticker art  * Hi Ho Cherry O, Candyland and other board games for toddlers

rQJLU2ndaa	I am pretty sure clomid can not cause a blighted ovum. It is your body's natural way of know that there is a problem at conception. I have heard that taking your medicine at the same time everyday is better.... but I have started it a whole day late and I still ovulated! So you should be fine! Good Luck to you!!! I will say a prayer for you!!   PS: Start BD every other day on day 14!!|`|T1hZG4O3aa	Clomid does not necessarily cause blight ovums, that generally happens when your egg wasnt mature enough to become a fetus.Its very common actually. Taking clomid late one time will cause no problems but like any medicine it is best to take it at the same time every day. As long as you dont make it a habit or take your next pill with you to work incase you get stuck again. Good luck with clomid. It is not a fertility treatment as it does not treat fertility, it only assists in helping you ovulate as you should. I used clomid once and am now pregnant. Hopefully you will have better luck this time around. The good thing is you know that Clomid works for you.
lQIKWXDuaa	Sorry to hear that. You need to sit down and speak with an OB. Some women loses babies  1-  5 etc..     They need to do a test and see what is the problem. You might have to look into surrogacy to get babies. Also maybe you might have to get bed rest after you find out that you are pregnant and hire a midwife if you can afford one. With the help of a good doctor who is observant you can have a baby. You just have to plan it well and get proper health care. My mom almost lost my baby brother since she fell, she hired a midwife to help through the rest of her pregnancy.    ss|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sorry for your loss.  Yes, it is true that more first pregnancies are lost than others.  Do you have any underlying conditions that can cause miscarriages.  Some women just can't carry babies to term.  I hope that this is not the case w/you.  Why don't you have a complete physical (if you haven't done so, yet).  Make sure the doctor doing the physical is aware of your 2 losses.  If you conceive again, you should see a high risk ob/gyn.  They take care of moms who are at high risk due to medical conditions, miscarriage history, etc.  Good luck to you in the future.|`|627pWyVkaa	generally because of birth defects, However most of those miscarriages happen really early on sometimes before woman even knew they were pregnant (4-5 weeks). Other reasons, are smoking is linked to higher percentage of woman smoking. Partying, excessive drinking, stress, things that are really hard on your baby. As well as physical problems with your body (scarring, ect ) that would make it a harder environment for your baby to develop in. A lot of the other reasons are really unknown! And sometimes just happen and there isn't anything wrong. If this is your second one, I would look into having your body checked out (health, uterus, tubes) and your partners sperm ( see if there is increase risk of birth defects) because this could be a reason. However if its any of the living styles, Maybe try to change these before trying again. And get your body ready for baby-   Here are some other reasons from a website, and it explains why and the percentage of chance for another-  ther things which may contribute to early pregnancy loss include:        * multiple pregnancy      * maternal age - there is a rise in miscarriage risk as maternal age increases. For women less than 35, the clinical miscarriage rate is 6.4%, for age 35-40 it is 14.7% and over the age of 40 it is 23.1%.      * poorly controlled diabetes - but not that which is well controlled      * scleroderma - a soft tissue disease      * fever over 100F      * smoking - 30-50% increased risk (even after correction for socioeconomic status)      * previous contraceptive pill use results in a slight reduction in the risk of miscarriage      * occupational exposure to solvents increases the risk of miscarriage    take a look, And Im really sorry I wish you best of luck!  http://www.womens-health.co.uk/miscarr.a...    edit- i would try talkng to your doctor, make sure to keep talking to your fiance about your feelings he is going through it too-, maybe a close friend or counselor may help if you dont feel like going into personal matters which a friend. And I hope this may help! really sorry!|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	Miscarriages are also caused by a variety of other factors, including:    Infection.   Exposure to environmental and workplace hazards such as high levels of radiation or toxic agents.   Hormonal problems.   Uterine abnormalities.   Incompetent cervix (the cervix begins to widen and open too early, in the middle of pregnancy, without signs of pain or labor).   Lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs.   Disorders of the immune system, including lupus.   Severe kidney disease.   Congenital heart disease.   Diabetes that is not controlled.   Thyroid disease.   Radiation.   Certain medications, such as the acne drug Accutane.   Severe malnutrition.   In addition, women may be at increased risk for miscarriage based on their age. Studies show that the risk of miscarriage is 12% to 15% for women in their 20s and rises to about 25% for women at age 40. The increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities contributes to the age-related risk of miscarriage.|`|irGE84Qdaa	i m so sorry to hear this,i have lost the baby when i was 6 weeks pregnant and i kno how i was feeling it was hard for me but lost it at 16 weeks i m so sorry but here is the thing 1st of all manage yourself it will take some time may a month and try to get pregnant again b4 u do that ask ur DR the Pacific reason of ur miscarriage if u r not satisfy then change the DR and keep in touch with her while u want to get pregnant ask her the good time cuz could be too many reasons which we dont kno why we miscarry and the 1st reason is GOD,S will just pray to him and 2nd thing which i concern keep an eye on ur progesterone level this is necessary cuz some DR dont give any supplements after 12 weeks cuz they think placenta takes over it place and then u dont need to have the progesterone any more this is what i can help and tell other reasons DR may kno better.  good luck|`|claW4UUcaa	we lost five before having our first baby. i am now a mom of two. it's very hard. you should go to couples therapy. see a fertility specialist to find out what the problem is.|`|opUngk8waa	when things like this happen, everyone assumes its the woman.  but a lot of the times its because of the man.  maybe you both should see a doctor.|`|c48fc86628996f74bac8ec89ba6c340aaa	My cousin had 7 miscarriages & was 35 years old before she had her first child.

When your period came did you pass any blood clots?  If so then it doesn't mean you aren't but it does point to a lower chance of being pregnant.  I think you should test. It will give you piece of mind. If you get a negative and you still think something is wrong wait it out until your period is due next time. If it doesn't come or is still acting weird contact your doctor and ask to be seen. They can do a blood test to be sure.|`|qtxPOBz7aa	sometimes my periods do the same things..sometimes they're long, sometimes not. and i have never heard of diarhea being a preg sign.. maybe you're just getting sick? and all the other signs sound like menstral symptoms. wait a week and get a test..if you're preg, you'll know then,
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Same boat hun.  I am five days late headed into six days tomorrow. I also have no symptoms of my period coming, in fact my cervix is extremely high and I am have other pregnancy symptoms. If you want the whole list you can read some of my other questions I posted.  I have done a lot of reading and they say it is possible to get a negative and not get a positive until you are a week or more late. Sometimes in early pregnancy it takes a while for the body to start releasing large amounts of the hormone. So in a few days test again, then make an appointment with your doctor. Most doctors won't do a blood test until you are two weeks late. So in that time you can test some more. I know a girl who didn't test positive with an at home HPT, but tested positive at 13 days late at the doctors office.  I also know another girl that only tested positive on a blood test. So don't give up hope yet.  As they say don't give up hope until your panties are in the wash:).|`|a3bba35e4bf4dc703759823f5ce16beeaa	i am 8 days late and still no signs of AF. i testes around 3-5 days late both neg.. im gonna wait 1 more week good luck!!|`|vTD0lId2aa	it could read a false positive give it another day or two and try again sometimes if it reads negative the pregnancy hormone is just not apparent if its to early...
xJW1RSaAaa	You might have a urinary tract infection. If there is blood in your urine, pregnant or not you should get it checked out.    Your father could be right if the urine is bright yellow - flourescent - but blood is red isn't it! If you are having bright urine and pains then it is probaby round ligament stretching on your abdomen.     Drink lots of water, try to take some sugar-free or naturally sweetened (not sweeteners) cranberry juice.  http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...    Overall I suggest strongly that you PLEASE go to see a GP.|`|AA11763588	That is not from your prenatal vitamins. You may want to call your DR and check and see if you have a bladder infection.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	its not your vitamins! they never should make you bleed! If i were you I would call the DR. right away!  You are supposed to call when you bleed like that, and you have cramps too?  Yeah, doctor, definitely.|`|WkaWSKNAaa	You had better call your doctor just to be sure nothing is going on.   Vitamins should not cause those symptoms.|`|qHAgbuHkaa	You probably have a bladder infection. You need to go into the doctor on Monday and have a test done for a bladder infection. Don't wait because it will only get worse.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	You could have a bladder infection, UTI, or a kidney infection. Call your dr. and see if you can come in. If this is the case they will give you some meds and all will be good. Bladder infections , at least for me, were very common in all of my 6 pregnancies. But please let your dr. know right away.|`|23fDrmZoaa	it is not your prenatal vitamins. I had the same symptoms and had a bladder infection during my pregnancy. You may also have a uti. Make a doc apt all it will take to clear it up is antibiotics. But you do want to make an apt becuase my doctor said that if the bladder infection/uti gets bad enough it can onset labor.|`|irGE84Qdaa	call ur DR|`|UFLfNlDfaa	If you have blood in your urine you need to see your doctor because those are symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) or it could of already turned into a Kidney Infection. They will have to put you on antibiotic that is safe for you and your baby. I've had about 7 UTI's during my pregnancy and 2 kidney infections... it's not fun, but if you don't get it taken care of it can harm you and your baby and it only gets worse. See your physician ASAP.
2MKvrydWaa	yes i have experienced the diarreah.it's perfectly normal.it's just your body cleaning itself out and getting ready for labor.i had it in my 36 week when i found out the baby dropped.then it went into the 37th week where i was tired and naseas all the time and the next week i was 38 weeks and 1 day i had my little angel.hopefully labor is right down the road for u and this is it.u don't have much longer 2 go so hang in there and good luck!!!congrats on the beautiful baby on the way:-)|`|54c33c2b2da66481bc77a67c47e5c81daa	You are not considered full term until 38 weeks. However, women do get diarrhea before pregnancy due to the fact of the pressure. When u do go into labor your intestines will and should be cleaned out from u having diarrhea in preparation when u push. When contractions start and waking around does not help them and u are feeling alot of pressure in ur pelvis, then u need to start counting ur contractions and call the MD. But u do sound like ur getting close. But not necessarily tomorrow. congradulations!!1|`|MpiTctvbaa	If your already 2 cm dilated the baby's coming soon.

I didn't have the bowel movements like your having but everyone is different.|`|F2RFHOmjaa	Calm down and try to relax.  Your body is preparing itself for labor.

Congratulations and Blessings!|`|OWw3LWDCaa	well you still have another 3 weeks until your due date, it could be false labour pains which some women experience. talk to your doctor, which you should be seeing weekly at this stage now.  babies come when they are ready. ive had 2, first one was 3 days early, the 2nd was 10 days late. your doctor will advise you on what is happening.|`|6Svqb2xAaa	going that much is a sign of labor :) i think your baby is going to be coming soon! WOOOOOOOOOT|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Considering how far along you are, and what you are experiencing I would say yes sounds like labor is not too far away. Just keep an eye on your contractions and make sure that they aren't too close together, and if they are then I would call the doctor. Hope this helps|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	your body gets rid of all your erm..........pooh! it makes it easier to push and makes sure you dont do it on hospital bed instead! you will  go into labour v soon
AA11763588	Well if you are doing a urine test then it usually takes 3.5 - 4.5 weeks for it to show up.    If you are getting a QUANT blood test then it normally takes about 2.5 weeks to show up.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	about 4 weeks|`|b5xyBG6daa	If you get a Quantitive blood test it'll show up if it even detects 1mg of HCG I found out when i was about 2 weeks pregnant but i knew it before then but they only did a simple blood test pretty much a yes or no and then i went back and got a quant and it came back positive.
Lprtz2A9aa	Don't live as someone your not. Always do what you feel in your heart is right. Talk to your doctor but explain to him/her about not wanting everyone to know your business until your ready.

Save it for as long as you can for someone special. Someone who understands you and accepts you for who you are.  As for the condom, practice on fruit. Wet on the outside, it should roll easily down. It needs to roll all the way down.   :)  Leave room in the top for the sperm.|`|H2w0bJmPaa	yes, wet goes on the outside  it's lube|`|BbMZySeEaa	here is some great advice you are not ready wait till marriage|`|ntdGOZqGaa	First off, whats wrong with being 18 and a virgin? To tell you honestly I think more guys need to be like that, sex isnt everything, and if you dont know all the proper things like how to use a condom or worried about getting someone pregnant then maybe you should wait just a little bit longer. Because condom or not, you can still get someone pregnant, what happens if it breaks? If I were you, I would think about it a little longer and try to keep your hormones under wrap, because if you are old enough to have sex you have to be old enough to be prepared for what happens durning sex and after. Hope this helps some.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	ok well for a start, CALM DOWN ( lol )  if you are that worried about it then make sure you ALWAYS wear a condom and if your only going to have sex as a one night stand than ask the girl if she is on the pill, that makes the chances pretty darn slim of her getting pregnant!  And as for the condom problem... the wet side goes on the outside, its lube, it helps it go in. Try practising at home, but make sure you are erect before you do otherwise it will be really difficult!  all you gotta do now is go out and get some!! =]  good luck|`|E7LSetRHaa	Kudos to you for staying a virgin. Stay that way until you get married. That is the best gift you can give your wife. Then it will all work out fine. God will bless you for it. Good luck and God bless.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	18 and still a virgin is good.  It is called abstinence.  I was 25 my first time.|`|S545jx81aa	Ok, its not bad that you waited to have sex. I waited till i was 19. its good to wait until you are prepared to take on the possible risks. You take a condom out of the wrapper, figure out which way it unrolls, you hold the tip of the condom, while holding onto the tip tightly you put it on the end of your penis and you roll it back as far as you can. My husband was explaining this to me and i typed lol. so a guy to a guy thats how its done. lol.   Don't be embarrased about it. its a natural thing that will happen eventually. Just BECAREFUL if you don't want babies. IF your not ready wear a condom no matter what and see if she is on bc. If she is its always good to back up with a condom in case bc isn't taken regularly or missed or if she has std's. Becareful, hope i helped and good luck.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	your 18?

kiAQi91laa	The term "Double Barreled" name is often used when a couple gets married and the female adds her husband's last name to hers.  Example would be my last name is Watson and I marry a man with a last name of Jones....my "double barreled' name would be Mrs. Watson-Jones.    If you're looking for your son to have a first name of Ace and a matching middle name to say along with it then I'd suggest names like:    Ace Baily  Ace Cole  Ace Spencer

I would go with Neve Ashlyn or even Neve Ashtyn.      :)|`|lGSUToFQaa	neve ashley,  neve jassandra  kaitlynn|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Again...    (never again)    HA !    I couldn't resist...    sorry....|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	Neve is a weird name...Girl or boy?|`|BcoOLVJsaa	I like 'Neve Ashlyn' -- but the initials are kind of odd...     You might get some ideas from this tool:  http://wiki.name.com/en/Baby_Naming_Wiza...    You can try making the middle name start with different letters...    Good luck!!
qH3pVH7Paa	you sound like u might be going into labour soon
qXq0nmBzaa	...very, very Victorian    The names, while unusual today, go very well together.  It's a pleasure to see you didn't go the "Flopsy & Mopsy" route.  These names will allow each child to flourish and be independent.  That alone makes them good choices.    Do I like them? Not really because Poppy comes off more as a nickname to the reserved Clementine. Dahlia, Delphine, Danica, Linnea, Rose/Rosa/Rosalind, and Zahra are all lovely floral names that sound a bit less cutesy.    Even if you chose to stay with your original choices, I applaud you for avoiding "the twins" pitfalls. Good for you.|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Those Names are horrible,and I dont like them at all..|`|5DK546BUaa	I love that each twin is individual    I love that the names aren't that trendy fluff that so many are using    However, I dislike Poppy as it seems childish and nickname-ish...|`|xLabGD6Maa	You must like flora and vegetation.   Not a fan of either  name.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I don't think they will like you very much once they start school.|`|sYEf626Aaa	are you a celebrity or something?|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Honestly I think they're absolutely adorable.|`|gB2BPIc7aa	im going to say no...poppy is a flower...and a seed....and clementine isnt that bad but its still not a nice sounding name|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Honestly, I don't like it.

Osn1xpu6aa	Bangs create the illusion your nose is smaller.   At least that is what I heard.    But, you can't really do anything, unless you want her to sleep with a clothes pin on the end of it, like Amy did in Little Women.    SO BASICALLY, she has to live with it.|`|zBFPEjDdaa	highlight the sides of the nose with a lighter shade. You can use blush or foundation.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	foundation . make up .  why is she so worried abt her nose?  tell her that ; when a person looks at her face   the nose isnt the first thing seen .  trust me on this .

fR2Geezcaa	Your to young and so is he! How could he possibly be prepared to shelter, cloth, feed, provide medical insurance  and financially support a baby? Who is going to watch after the baby while he as at work and/or school (college, I hope), his Mom or you?<br>  <br>  What happens when he can't take care of the baby by himself? If you think your just going to have a baby and  hand it off to him then your way to immature to be having one! This will ruin your teenage years. It is hard to find a prom dress in the maternity section! It sounds like he is trying to hold on to you and he knows he will be able to if you two have a child together. Just be prepared for the near future when your the one sitting at home night after night taking care of the baby while your friends are out being teenagers and having fun.|`|AA10186411	How old is he?  If he is 13, he is an idiot.  If he is older, then not only is he an idiot, but he is a pervert for having sex with a 13 year old.  Go outside and play, and stop thinking about boys.  They only want one thing from you.|`|aJjV5b95aa	You are really to young. Tell him that you are not ready it sounds like he is trying to tie you down and control you. Seriously you should not try to get pregnant and be sure to use protection while you are having sex. Believe me having a baby really young is not fun. He might say that he will take care of it now but that does not mean that he really will.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	So, he has a job that pays enough to have a home, food, car, medical insurance, car insurance and a nanny? wow. he must be old to have all that. In that case he would be arrested for statutory rape, because you are not even old enough to consent to sex. You are still a child. Just got out of elementary school. Stop talking about such things.|`|6L9jJnchaa	You're dating a rapist...congrats.|`|ZyACe4kcaa	uhm dont do it...ur too young|`|r7TYRp8Waa	not a good idea. you both need to want a baby, together.. you need to be in a loving stable relationship... Your only 13, if you both in a few years are still together and still want a child, maybe reconsider it then. your so young, and having a baby is a huge responsibility..  you boyfriend is being selfish. he needs to think about you and the baby's life..|`|2elgku3paa	marsha g,<br>  <br>  personally id say i agree with some other comments and answers on this question .. you should only have a baby if its what you want.<br>  im 17 and im currently 17 weeks and two days pregnant it is the best thing in my life but me and my partner have our own two bed house and are in a stable relationship.<br>  if you wantt a baby you should think about how youd look after it, how to pay for it, how to buy all the supplies and all the rest and if you can support it.<br>  <br>  but please dont have a baby because your boyfriends wants because your body isnt fully developed and 13 is a bit young but noone should judge you =)<br>  plus most boys say that to you then when your pregnant they leave ya because they dont want the baby or because they want to live there lifes and not be tied down <br>  <br>  just think about it hunni xx|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	its not a good idea your the one that has to actually have the baby and go through all the pain!! not him so its not fair on you hun. do u actually want a baby or are you just doin it for him if you both want a baby tell him maybe wen your a lil bit older cos you feel to young and if he loves you he will stick wit you  answer <br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|TFYlv3bxaa	Are you kidding me?????And you are actually thinking about this?  One other question for you to think about then..............What are you going to do if you get pregnant, and then HE changes his mind?  Live your life first, before trying to help another live their life.|`|fZGBjtpVaa	You do realise he can get done for statutory rape, as you're only 13?  So if you do indeed become pregnant, he'll more than likely be sent to prison.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Imagine the screaming and hollering and "Are you crazy"s you'd get from your parents if you asked them......there's a GOOOd reason for that.|`|y64uHdyJaa	Not a teenager? What do you thin thirTEEN means?|`|hyY9Vw1Waa	do it for the lol|`|54O7YuWoaa	Well if he wants a baby then he can go to jail because your not even a teenager, so if you love him you would not do anything stupid to make him go to jail wait intel your about 15 or 16 I got pregnant at age 14 and had my first child at age 15.. and i am 15 right now I am going on 16 in June|`|XaR8Gzhhaa	You do know that your are being raped right?

Ccq8zEcnaa	You shouldn't be lifting heavy objects while pregnant. You don't want to pull a muscle or tear something which is very easy for a pregnant woman to do.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	you should not be lifting heavy objects, dont lift anymore and go and check with your midwife to make sure everythings still ok|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Your uterus is a muscle and if you lift heavy objects like doors or radiators you can pull or tear a muscle, such as your uterus, it can cause a premature labor or a uterine rupture or any number of terrible things.  Do try to stop lifting heavy objects|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I don't know about niggles but lifting heavy objects is a no no.  My mother was 43 and thought she didn't have her periods because of menopause.  She had always had a hard time to conceive.  She moved the television while doing the cleaning and started to hemorrhage.  She had been four months pregnant.|`|UzqYQf0Jaa	sorry but i don't know what a niggle is <br>  <br>  but i do know you shouldn't be lifting heavy things|`|dDVAUA9saa	Sorry, I have NO idea what "niggles" are....|`|jrdtQi04aa	Do not lift anything else.  Take it easy and relax a bit.  Get the strain off your body.  I was pregnant twice and had to move both times!  I needed more space.  I took my time in unpacking and stuff.  You take it slow, and get someone else to lift stuff for you.  When you are going to be a mommy, it's not the time to be bold and in control.  Pamper yourself, and stop working so hard.|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Certainly do avoid lifting anything <br>  Dont bend or sit and stand up at pace even<br>  While you get up from your sleep be sure to get up slowly taking curves and rest a while then leave bed<br>  As you are wake up you have nausea at that time so dont even leave bed in a rush <br>  <br>  these tips you should follow at this point of time<br>  Lifting is for sure no <br>  <br>  Take help of your hubby and let him do all this for you<br>  <br>  enjoy pregnancy|`|eMSP740Taa	Have no idea what niggles are but you should not in any cercumstance be lifting heavy objects while pregnant.

Good luck with everything!|`|4GwTDea1aa	Probably the baby moving around.. but putting stres on yourself also puts stress on your baby!

But as a general anwser, No, I dont recommend it   :)|`|9vz1bsFzaa	No high schooler should have sex.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	No.    Don't have sex until your ready to handle absolutely all the responsibilities that come with it.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	Uh...no.|`|029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	It depends on the teen. Not only on their age (13 and eighteen are two completely different things) but on their maturity level, which is something that's hard to rate for yourself.   Basically, the very best thing you can do is not have sex with anyone who doesn't respect your privacy and body, and not to have sex with anyone who makes you feel pressured. And always use protection. If they don't want to, then that's just something that they should be willing to give up so that you can be safe.     Something like one in three people has an STD, and they aren't just "those people" who you think they are. Once you start having sex, get tested regularly, as condoms are not completely fool-proof. Never re-use a condom, and if you accidentally mess up while putting it on, just toss it and get a new one to try again. If you're with the right person, they will understand that this is not something you're used to. They should be there to support you, not to make you feel like you're putting on a show.     Just so you know, when you have healthy sex in real life, it absolutely does not produce the same emotional feelings that pornography produces, so expect something that is new and complex. And don't start until you have found the right person, long-term. Also, try to find an adult that you trust who knows you better, so that they can help you make this decision for yourself. If you have to ask, you probably shouldn't just yet. But it does mean that you're being responsible to consider that you should wait, so you're obviously showing some traits of a person who is maturing into a very good catch for someone. Congratulations on making this decision in a responsible way. It shows a lot of character.|`|ac5r2V1maa	Yes, only if you are married and NO if you are not.|`|KwkEvmpPaa	NO NO No NO wait till you have a job and and pay your own **** than sure|`|05XVCQR3aa	I think that sex is fine for a teen as long as you do it safely. And I mean physically and emotionally safe. You should always use condoms to prevent STDs and pregnancies and make sure you and whoever you are having sex with is ready to make that kind of commitment.|`|K32Kpbjeaa	If you're ready then yeah it's for a teen. I'm 14 and I lost my virginity two days after my 14th birthday. =] ?|`|kdxxuQwNaa	If you can't spell need, then no.|`|NTfIJa7zaa	It's not for a teen. If you have sex before the age of 20 your private part will fall off!|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	If you're both ready (and the same age-ish!), then I don't see anything wrong with it as long as you use protection!|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	If you have sex then the girl gets pregnant then God wanted you to.|`|x5GMWHRdaa	no teens shouyld have sex...if you feel as if you cant wait...try to atleast wait till college.

If you're thinking that when the baby's sleeping is time for you to get chores done...forget it! That's what daddy's there for. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, an additional day at the hospital or a book wouldn't change anything. Have faith that you are prepared to handle anything your little baby needs. It's amazing how it just comes naturally. <br>  <br>  Be prepared now to stay up nights and have a friend or your mother or mother in law ready to answer those 3am "what do I do?" questions from you. It's normal.<br>  <br>  You are blessed! Congratulations!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	There are some books that can help you.Don't be afraid to read those.also baby's do wake up a lot during the night so be prepared.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	don't pick baby up too much! let her get used to laying alone...or u'll regret it later!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	The first thing to do right now is adjust your priorities.  Don't worry about anything besides you and baby getting enough sleep & food for the first week or so.  <br>  <br>  When you're feeling more confident, calm, rested, healthy, then start trying to find a rhythm in your days together, slowly adding in the things that you need to do each day.  <br>  <br>  Know that, in time, you will become more comfortable with the new shape of your family & of your days.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	The best thing to do is take each day as it comes. Day by day, the sooner I learned how to do this the easier it got. It is a huge adjustment to have a baby. Just give yourself time. It took a good month or so before I really got adjusted. If you have any friends or relatives nearby ask them to visit frequently. This really helped me whether they are helping you out or just there to keep you company. Also try and take a nap with your baby everyday. Good luck hun and don't be afraid to call the dr. if you have any doubts, thats what they are there for!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Congrats on your new baby!<br>  <br>  You must change your concept of sleep.  The "bedtime is at night and you awake in the morning" concept has to go out the window.  Your baby will be up at all hours of the day and night.  Get sleep when you can.  Take naps with the baby if you can.  <br>  <br>  Accept help when it's offered.  <br>  <br>  The first few nights are the hardest.  But it does get better.|`|FplTPoAyaa	Sleep whenever you can.  Don't worry about the housework.  A happy baby is more important, and the baby will only be happy if you are, which means sleep !  Take time for yourself when you can, even if its just a hot bath, reading a book, or meditating.  Shower everyday and put on clothes (even if its just sweats)...if you stay in your PJ's, you will feel worse.

bjGNV81uaa	Q 1 - Our bathroom doors close fine, so we just keep them closed. I have never used the toilet latch or seen anyone who used one. However, one woman I know bought a simple latch and eyehook from Wal-mart and attached it to her pantry door near the top, and that worked to keep her kids out of the snacks. That might be cheaper and less of a pain than the toilet lock.<br>  <br>  Q 2 - We used to have a cat too, and we had the same problem (plus the dog thought the cat stuff was food. Gross). We bought the Clevercat top entry litter box from Petsmart. Here is the link to the info page about it, or if you'd rather, just go to petsmart.com and click on cats, then litter boxes, and it's on the second page.<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754439" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  Anyway, it's like a big box with a hole on top, and if you have it between the wall and something else, it may be a little more of a pain for Robby to mess with. The top comes off, but it kind of snaps on, like one of those big rubbermaid containers, so it's a little harder for little ones to get into. Plus it doesn't have the cool swinging door on it. :) That's what my son liked. Check it out at least, it might help you. Or, you could always do what my best friend did - give away the cats. ;) Just kidding.<br>  <br>  If neither of those things are helpful, you will probably just have to keep removing him from those two dangers consistently until he learns that they are not to play with. Consistent consequences are probably key here, for instance, time outs or a pop on the hand if you believe in that, or whatever you decide, and they just stick with the consequences until he gets out of this phase. Maybe. LOL I'm in the same boat, my son wasn't nearly as much trouble as my daughter is, LOL. She's only 13 mo and can already climb into and out of the bathtub, and does so regularly. I find her sitting the there, waiting for me to fill it up so she can play. Sigh. She also delights in pulling everything out of the dishwasher. I'm like, are you kidding? Who would have thought of that? LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck with your babies!|`|bCcQBG23aa	Fix the door.Its probally a simple fix you could easily do on your own and you dont even realize.<br>  Move the litter box.If something is just not working well in one spot its best to keep moving things around til you find the best spots for things.<br>  Try some cheap motion detector alarms/chimes or even the ones that go off when a door or window is opend. You can sometimes find these useful gadgets in dollar stores.(different dollar stores carry different things so check more than one store if you cant find anything at first).<br>  If your son keeps trying to get in or open the toilet seat I would consider it a big deal safety wise since it is a known fact that children (even older kids) can and have drownd in the smallest amounts of water. I have a 19month old son right now and hes into everything more so everyday. I have a two connecting rooms in my home which are completely baby proof to the point I barely have any furniture in them so hes not climbing, and the furniture I do have I cant keep any of my things on that I normally would.|`|oiJITSNZaa	The best way to keep a child out of things is consistent consequences. In no uncertain terms when he gets into the toilet tell him "NO" and use some method of discipline. It will take weeks but this I found is the best of ways. People that put child safety locks on everything are avoiding the consequence issues. I found and I have 3 hyper children that it is not at all necessary to child proof your house as all these modern day child specialist say. Yes common sense such as receptacle outlet plugs. But your child will learn and it will be for the best then when you go to other's places that are not child proof it won't be such a headache if they already have learned what is a no-no. Don't expect your child to learn in 1 day or even a week...it takes much time and definitely consistency. Don't let him play in the cupboard one day then discipline him for playing in it the next day. This will only confuse him. Loving consistency is what every  child in this world needs. Patience too!
VwMkiLFPaa	Isn’t that so cute?? I always got a kick out it. I just answer back as if I know everything he’s saying. I personally feel that it helps teach them that much more if you speak back to them as if you can understand. That’s only my opinion of course.<br>  <br>  My son speaks half babble and half real words/sentences. When I understand him, I respond properly. When I can’t, I judge by his actions (if I can) and respond accordingly. <br>  <br>  I think it’s hilarious because HE knows what he’s saying. Even if I don’t.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	Yes almost all kids do this before they talk. Isn't it so cute?|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Yes, this is perfectly normal, he feels he's joining in the conversation! Boys are also a lot slower a talking than girls, but once he gets started, there will be no turning back, you won't believe how quick they pick things up!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Yep, he's just once step closer.  My son did this a lot when he was that age, and then one day, it was as though he could say almost anything.  It's an adorable stage, isn't it?  :)|`|jrVlzffeaa	My son does this he's 16months, he babbles on and on and sometimes you can make out what he's trying to say, lol. I was going to ask this question but got distracted!! lol Xx|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, that's it exactly.
zuZKj3xXaa	yeah.. thats normal lol they seem REAL don't they? like  there isn't any doubt in your mind that they rnt real!! i had more dreams than Nightmares, and there was many a nites when i woke up Crying because the dreams wernt real :( <br>  <br>  and the nightmares scared the CRAP out of me :( i had one nightmare when i put my baby girl up for adoption but decided not to see her..i worked with the girls mom that adopted her, and i decided i wanted to visit my baby, they leaded me into the bathroom at their house, cause that was her room.. i saw her, and she was a PLUNDER! with Lysol for hair, it was Blue hair all stickin up.. idk if she was a plunger or the toilet wand! but.....it was more weird than scary, i laugh at it now ha ha....<br>  <br>  the dreams are completely normal.. there is some site you can get on through Google to read some pretty funny pregnancy dreams that women have had and wrote about.. its pretty entertaining!! :) if you have nothing to do, look up Pregnant Dream stories!! on google..:) have fun! :) <br>  <br>  Briley Marie, due TOMORROW!! or anytime!!! :)|`|jrdtQi04aa	It means nothing.  You're just scared of having a girl.  If you do, dont worry.  They are loads of fun, and you may find her to be just like you, which is why you are probably having bad dreams!  Trust me, I know!  Boys are great too.  Man, the toys are the greatest.  You will have a blast playing with them all.  My son had some stuff he could hardly get because me and his dad were playing!  Barbies are cool, too.  Get all the houses, and just sit back and have play time.  It's a blast.  The dreams dont mean anything!  Just means you want a boy.|`|eMSP740Taa	Hey, maybe subconsciously your body is telling you that a boy is on the way! I mean, having great dreams about a baby boy every night and then having a terrible dream about a girl?...But don't take nightmares too seriously. It is totally normal to have all kinds of different dreams about babies especially while being pregnant or while wanting to be pregnant OR while thinking you might be. GOOD LUCK WITH IT ALL!! =]|`|ybexjS2Paa	While pregnant with my daughter a few times I had a dream about waking up in the middle of the night and my sheets were all cover in blood and I knew I lost the baby.

They mostly involved me taking him somewhere and then forgetting him or waking up not knowing where I had put him. <br>  <br>  I have had a few crazy dreams during this pregnancy but not really any about the baby yet. <br>  <br>  Your body is full of hormones and the hormones affect everything from skin, hair, appetite, digestion, emotions and even your dreams/nightmares.<br>  <br>  I have a friend that always dreamt that her baby was actually a ballpoint pen! lol<br>  <br>  So, anyway, its completely normal. If it gets so bad that it interferes with your sleep then you should talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Ignore bad dreams they mean nothing. Don't worry about it.

NbJbZXtGaa	You need to "over do it". Anytime she does anything in the potty, even the smallest drop, you should sing the potty song, dance, high five, hug, kiss, praise, jump for joy. This really enforces the idea in her head that this is a GREAT thing and that she did a good job. Some people use candy or other rewards, but I don't believe in doing that. I just did the above with my boys and it worked for us.<br>  <br>  Plus, everything momto2 said above is great advice!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	It can be a scary thing for kids to potty train!<br>  <br>  Do you take her in the bathroom with you when you need to pee? My husband and I both do this with our son so he can see it’s okay. And we talk to him as we go (awkward but hey, we’re parents now) and we say “See, Mommy goes pee on the potty. It’s okay. YAY! Go Mommy!” And we do high fives and get excited. <br>  <br>  Also, if I may suggest, attempt to make it routine. I noticed with our 2 yr old son that in the mornings, since it’s routine to use the potty first, he does it without fighting us. During the day, it’s not routine, so he fights us. At night before bed, it’s routine, part of our bath routine, and he doesn’t fight us. So I really believe in making it routine so it becomes normal for them and they don’t think about it. Then as they get older and can comprehend what they’re doing, they can focus on the urge and begin to go on their own. <br>  <br>  Potty training is SOOOOO time consuming and it takes a world of patience! Just keep up the praise. Maybe buy a good potty book or a movie. Elmo has a potty DVD that my son LOVES! <br>  <br>  Good luck! Potty training is a blast! LOL!|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	I started training at 2 years old with both my kids. They were trained totally 3 months later. Here is what I did, and was very successful. I bought a plastic box and decorated it and said it was the special prize potty box. Then I filled it with dollar toys from target, etc. You have to make sure they cannot see in the box so they can't search through the toys. It stayed in the bathroom at all times so they associated the toys with going potty. Then I told them when they went potty on the potty they would get to pick a surprise. This worked really well because they were very motivated! Good Luck!|`|faLD7RiVaa	You didn't happen to buy her one of those "musical" potty chairs, did you? If you did, that would explain why she panicked. If you didn't, maybe it was just the hollow sound of her "business" hitting the potty bottom. Either way, don't worry, as you probably know already but just have forgotten, they always come around. Children are an amazing thing, with each one we panic over the most trifling things, most times the same thing each time, but when it happens with a new child we often forget that we went through this same exact thing already, it just appears new.
RjdrO7DVaa	pregnancy symptoms and flu symptoms are constantly confused.  The only sure way to tell, is if you miss your period.  Until that happens, don't take any medicine.  I know you feel like sh** but try to just rest.  Take a test on the 2nd in the morning.  Best of luck to you!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	I wouldn't yet beings its most likely to show anything. I would wait till my period is overdue. This being flu season it well may be a bug you picked up. As for your cycle, are you sure you even ovulate? that is the #1 mistake a lot of people in here make. They think just because they have their period that automatically they ovulate. FALSE! you can have your period and not ovulate. I recommend ovulating tests. Good Luck!|`|jrdtQi04aa	Relax and wait a bit.  Dont worry about it and have some more dance time.  I know you are going for the fertile days, but what if an egg slips out unnoticed?  have some fun and relax!|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	yeah theres no harm in it!|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Wait till you pass your period days then after a week take the tests <br>  If you test positive consult a doc for further guidance and dos and donts<br>  If you think you might have conceived then start taking precaution from now onwards like avoid lifting heavy weights ETC to see the good results soon<br>  <br>  Enjoy|`|hNIof0lbaa	Wait to see if your coming up period comes, if not...go buy a test & take it as soon as you get up in the morning!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, it's too soon.

3ZNf4ef9aa	Sounds like he is doing GREAT! Good job momma!  My girl is 32 months and she still doesn't like to color much, we aren't very worried about it. Kissing is something you need to teach, we only realized that when my niece wasn't kissing at all, and my girl was kissing everyone (they are the same age)- it has to be taught and encouraged. Talking will come, just keep encouraging him - have you tried any sign language? It sounds like he understands and hears you, but has found other ways to respond to you. A language explosion is coming soon!! Work on the skills you are worried about with him, it will come... I know its hard not to compare, but sounds like he is doing just fine. If you are still concerned, talk to your doc at his 18 month appointment.|`|968AkJkiaa	... I have three boys and they are all different but One thing I have Noticed boys seem have some delay in speech meaning girls mature faster with speech the boys. My six year old did not say 1 word till he was 2 then at about 2 1/2  then he just started talking and now I cant get him to be quite =]  My 2 year old is in speech now because he still doesn’t say much , he understands most anything you tell or ask him. He was born early though so they have him in speech for precautions. His Speech therapist says he is not behind really because boys can take up to 2 1\2-  3years before that speak well. My one year old boy that was born at 29weeks is already starting to say some words... see all kids are so different, so as far as the speech give it time and work with him, talking to him constantly and saying words over and over again. As Far as him not hugging and kissing could be just some kids are no as loving a others some just like to run around everything else sounds pretty normal to me I have had 2 Preemies so I know all about the  "milestone charts" lol!  Just Remember that all kids are different and special in their own ways one other little thing I have heard and notice is that if a child starts motor skills early that speech will fall behind a little and the other way around. If You are Truly Worried call His doctor and discuses it with him That would probably be the Best thing for you so that you can have a peace of mind about it!! God Bless and Good Luck!|`|bjGNV81uaa	I can't remember about the pointing. I think my son was probably around that age, maybe a little older. He didn't start talking until he was about 2 1/2. Around 2 he finally started saying things like Mama, Dada, ball, Layla (the dog), dog, cat, etc. Things he saw every day. Around 2 1/2 he got a lot more words in, and then after he turned 3 he just exploded into full blown conversations and sentences, and now he never stop talking, LOL! :) KIssing...I think he gave me his first kiss around a year, and my 13 month old will give me kisses now, but they are the open mouth slobbery ones. I can't remember when my son started giving my real kisses. My son didn't start wanting to color until about six months ago. Some kids just aren't interested in scribbling. He wasn't at all. One of the first things he drew was a person, complete with ears and hair! LOL! I think I have two or three pages of scribbles, but that's all. It sounds like your little guy is doing just fine. :) Just remember that all kids are different. Even my two are so different, and you would think they'd be pretty similar, being from the same parents. (Oh, and the listening only 50% of the time? Just get used to that, LOL. :)<br>  Anyway, some kids focus on different types skills at different times. If you are really concerned, ask his pediatrician and s/he will be able to tell you if they think there's a problem. But honestly, he will probably come around very soon. Good luck! :)|`|98fdbd5cd1b814cad2a0336c5272ae4faa	I think it sounds about right. Not every child develops at the same rate.  The one thing I'd keep an eye on is this:<br>  "he does not point to things. however--he will take my hand or pull me towards something he wants" <br>  - our pediatrician identified that as one of the signs of developmental delay.<br>  If you are really worried, you can bring it up with your doctor.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Sounds about right for his age you can try and work with his words. We either say and point or use flash cards and make a game out of finding the words. My son is picky if you say give so and so kisses he doesn't respond but if you say give daddy a mwahh (he likes the sound better that the name I suppose) he will.
98WKYtfwaa	Having an orgasm does make your uterus contract, but it's not strong enough to result in labour.<br>  <br>  It can however help labour along but only if you're body is ready for labour (started dialating, lost your plug etc). At 37weeks i highly doubt it'll move things along unless labour is already begining.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i have been told that orgasms make the uterus contract which causes contractions which lead to labor. but it's not necessarily going to put you into labor. you can try walking, a warm bath, etc.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  They don't typically result in labor.  You can keep safely having sex until you deliver unless your Dr. advises you otherwise.|`|2a6cb7ea07ea5187f422cf0c3777e421aa	it is conducive to labor because it helps<br>   the cervix  dilate.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sort of, your uterus does contract a little and the cervix dips into the vaginal well.

ioZeveazaa	Things you will need for your baby..<br>  1. CLOTHES- If you can buy up to 6 months then do it because baby will grow fast and it will be one less thing to worry about. Also if you can find a good "secondhand" store then that will save you alot of money on baby clothes. Alot of these stores have gently used and even new clothes sometimes that are in great shape for half the price.<br>  (Get "onesies" because they will be used alot and are easy for baby to wear around the house and play.)<br>  2. DIAPERS/WIPES- You can get regular diapers or cloth. Cloth save money however are more of a hassle and in my opinion not quite as sanitary. Just my opinion.<br>  3.  CARSEAT/STROLLER<br>  4. BABY CRIB/BASSINET- Most bassinets are only to be used for about the first two months and then the baby outgrows them but they are good for co-sleeping which is nice for newborns. A convertible type crib is convenient because they can convert from crib to daybed to twin or full size bed. Adjustments vary on each crib so just check it. Good buy though.<br>  5. STORAGE-Whether you buy a dresser or storage bins, it doesn't matter. You will definitely need some storage and organization to help keep your wife sane. It will keep everything in order and she will know exactly where everything is.<br>  6. BATH/BODY PRODUCTS- You will need to get lotion, buttrash cream, hair/body wash, nailclippers for baby, thermometer!!!(rectal is best for babies but ask your pediatrician), aspirator (suction ball for nose), qtips (ear swabs), washclothes, a couple of baby towels. I don't know what you have in your country but Johnson's baby products are very popular here in the US. Anything that is designed for baby is good though just as long as it isn't harsh.<br>  7. DIAPER BAG- From my own experience it is best to buy atleast a medium size bag because you will run out of room quickly in a small bag. Also a bag that has a long strap that can be worn "cross body" is nice because it will allow you to be hands free so you can carry the baby and other items. (Alot of bags come with travel changing mats in them, this is nice because you never know where you will be when baby needs a diaper change! =))<br>  8. BOPPY PILLOW(optional)- This is a convenient item especially if your wife i considering breastfeeding. Even if she isn't though it will help to relieve some of the weight on her when trying to feed baby. It will assist in holding baby and it also is nice for baby to lay and sleep in.<br>  9. BOTTLES- If you are going to use these then you will probably need to find one that your baby really likes so you may end up buying a couple. Don't stock up on one kind until you know for sure what kind your baby likes. GET A BOTTLE BRUSH TO FOR CLEANING.<br>  10. PACIFIERS-(optional) <br>  11. PLAYPEN/PACNPLAY-(optional) This is a bigger version kind of, of the bassinet. It is mainly intended as a "safe area" for your baby to nap and play during the day however try to not to leave baby unattended even if they are in this. These are nice though because they can be put in the living room, etc and mom can clean or do whatever while baby is napping/playing here. =)<br>  <br>  OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE NEEDED LATER ON<br>  <br>  1. SWING-(optional)<br>  2. BOUNCEY CHAIR-(optional)<br>  3. PLAYMAT/TOYS- Use these to help stimulate baby's senses so he/she can learn.<br>  4. HIGHCHAIR<br>  <br>  ITEMS MOM WILL NEED<br>  <br>  Since your wife will be nursing she will need....<br>  Nursing bras, breast cream to help heal any chapping, nursing pads, nursing shirts<optional but makes nursing easier,<br>  <br>  <br>  When you go to buy clothes for baby don't overbuy any ONE size. Get some newborn, then 0-3mths, and then 3-6mths. Your baby will grow fast. If you have any questions about the sizes talk to the store associate. They will help you. Most newborns are between 6-9lbs so this will fit newborn size. <br>  <br>  I can't think of anything else that you will need and I hope this helps you atleast get started. Good luck!!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	First off, babies don't need much, it's the parents who usually over indulge.  My 4th son is due the day before yours, so I'm right there with you.  A place to sleep, some fitted sheets, blankets to wrap him in.  Your wife may want to get some lanolin for her breasts as it will be her first time to breast feed and they often get dried out and sore the first time around.  A car seat for infants, and as for clothes, since it will almost be summer a few onsies should be fine.  I'm no good with Kgs, so I will just say that getting onsies for 7 to 12 lbs is about newborn size.  <br>  After your wife gives birth she will be about 2nd trimester size again, so she can comfortably wear those maternity clothes for a while as she shrinks back down.  A nursing bra, comfortable, preferably cotton.  Babies (despite what the hospital says) shouldn't be bathed more than 2 to 3 times a week.  Their skin produces a natural moisture and washing them everyday or every other day strips them of that.  For the first couple weeks just a mild baby soap or none at all is best and a wash cloth.<br>  This should get you going for a while.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	www.ivillage.co.uk has a good list :)|`|AA11916244	Well as far as the baby clothes most babys will weigh in at the 7lb mark. Sorry i dont know what that is where you guys are at. But I would get most clothes starting there. Also I would get a few outfits under 5 lbs or "premie" as they call them here. Because most of my kids weighed 7-8lbs and the newborn stuff was too big and the preemie stuff was just right. But those clothes will probably last you the first 2-3 weeks. Also you really dont need any special nursing outfits. She may want to look into a nursing cover. It goes over her so she can nurse in public if need be. With bath products you will need to get something that is hypoallergenic and his little scent because the little one will have a sensitive nose. Baby bedding, really nothing special just look for a bedding set that the two of you like.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Normally if you are buying newborn clothes than the weight is between 8lb to 12lb, for first three months than you can go from that.  You will need lots of newborn cloths depending on the weather, socks, onsies, baby hat and mittens, baby blanket, towel and baby wash cloths and lot and lot of diapers and wipes.  Also, baby lotion, baby wash, baby oil, diaper rash cream and baby powder.  If you are planning bottle feed than baby bottle and brush.<br>  car seat, stroller, crib, crib set, baby monitor If you want you can also buy changing table, but I don't think that is necessary.  <br>  Also there are many website that will give you a list of products you will need|`|m1d0fxj5aa	most babies are born at 7lbs to 9lbs. look in that range for the clothes. you need blankets for coming home from hospital. in the hospital bag the mommy will need some comfy clothes slippers, tooth brush maxi pads ,(she will still bleed ALOT), something soothing to help calm her. alot of new mommys buy a bassinet insead of a crib so that the baby is sleeping beside mommy and daddy.  it helps with the late night feedings. she will need a breast pump if she plans on breast feeding. you can buy some bras for the new momma that makes it easier to help with the breast feeding. if she doesnt get a baby shower than baby boy will need bottles, pacifiers (if you choose), lots of clothes (diffrent sizes) lots of blankets, lots of diapers, baby swing, a vibrating seat, bottle cleaner, those are the basic things that baby will need, the rest is pretty much stuff you choose to buy :)|`|UkQuMykiaa	If you go to the babies r us website - they have a starter list of everything you may need.  Keep in mind not everything is necessary - but this will be a good starting guide.  Also if they have any childbirth education classes through the hospital over there - you can get good information and meet other new parents.  Good luck to you and congrats - hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=3200390" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?ca...</a>|`|RjdrO7DVaa	You're gonna need:<br>  <br>  a car seat<br>  bottles, nipples, bottle brush (just incase she can't nurse)<br>  baby monitor<br>  toys and stimulating objects<br>  healthcare products like medicines, combs, nail files, bulb suctions<br>  sheets for the CRIB, the bumper for the sides of the crib<br>  receiving blankets<br>  <br>  theres sooo much more too.|`|jrdtQi04aa	Get a lot of diapers or I think you call them napkins or something.  Get the newborn clothes for under 12 lbs.  Dont get too, too many.  Wait to see what you will need.  Get a lot of onesies.  (one piece with feet in them)  Under shirts.  She will need cloth diapers to help cover her breast with feeding.  Plus, they are good for cleaning up when the baby throws up.  About 8 small bottles (glass ones) nipples.  Water for the baby, as they cant drink tap water.  Aslo breast fed babies really hate water, as they really want the breast.  Wife will need to drink a lot of water.  You need two diaper bags because they get dirty, and you will have to clean one while using the other.  We used neutrogena products for the babys to wash in.  It is very mild and we were able to get large bottles of it.  Very expensive, but my kids had nice skin.  Also, diaper rash cream, baby wipes, soft baby brush and comb. at least 8 baby blankets.  A changing table and you will find the bedding comes in the store with the baby bed.  Make sure all the stuff is safety checked.  The people at the store will be glad to help you with that.  She will need at least 4 nursing bras.  They release in the front so that you can reach your breast easier.  Get button up shirts for her so she can get to her breast easier, without having to lift up a sweater or over the head shirt.  My kids are older, so I cant help with the safest car seats and stuff, but I hope I was some help.
X1NVjZEKaa	Dear. You should call no one ugly ever. You have no idea how it will affect them. In the situation you were in you should have explained to her what gay was (Its not like its a bad thing) and then tell her she shouldnt call people that. So now you should say "Im very sorry for calling you ugly, no one is ugly at all" and then go on to explain to her why you called her that and that calling people gay is bad also.  :)|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	Apologize! She's 4 years old! You are so dumb! Just a 4 year old called you gay, you had to square to her level! Idiot!|`|N24wkFROaa	TROLL.    lmfao at this question|`|Osn1xpu6aa	yes!  She's 4.   You are presumably much older than 4.   Chill out. She didn't even mean it.    Wow, you got pretty mad at that comment though! ARE you in denial?|`|dzuiWVZjaa	lmao tht is so funny im sorry but i actually laughed at tht, great mental image conversation there haha...    sorry    tell her what a gay person is and say ur dad is one    no dont say tht lol us tell her what one is and say sorry for calling her ugly|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Wow, are you 4 also, didn't think so.  So don't act like one.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	You find yourself having to insult a 4 year old , yes it is wrong to call a 4 year old ugly, what you have done is childish and spiteful, my advice is stay away from the child you are a nasty person, you should set examples to children not act like trailer trash and insult them grow up.|`|9vz1bsFzaa	Nowadays kids say "gay" to mean "not cool", and she probably repeated it without kreally knowing either meaning. I would just tell her that you were kidding and that she is actually really pretty.|`|gILygKvRaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Yes, especially in our world today. In the mind of a young girl that could lead to eating disorders and self loathing|`|DWl8nfyWaa	Yes it is.  She's FOUR.  Have you forgotten that?|`|QGP930C6aa	apoligise .. she didnt know what it ment so why did you take it so personally     explain to her its not a good thing to call someone and that you dont think shes ugly really you just got cross... just give her lots of love until she feels better|`|EE7sAaMlaa	yeh it was wrong but its pretty funny lol. just tell her u were joking, shell probably b too scared to say anythin horrible to u again nw, loads of 4 yr olds r so spoilt, itll make her grow up lol.|`|nGwzzNTFaa	duh  apologize although it was very rude for her to say you're gay and if she wasn't 4 then I would say don't do anything.  tell her you were only mad she called you gay when you weren't.|`|GKJEgidzaa	No, she obviously doesn't know better than to say things like that yet, you should have corrected her and explained that is not a good thing to say, you pretty much just made it okay in her mind to insult people in that way.  Not to mention instilling that kind of insult on a little girl of four good have her developing a complex. Being called ugly at four is probably going to do a little damage.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes, its wrong.    I find it amusing that a 4 year old child called you "gay", when you admit that she doesn't even know what it means, and you got so offended that you felt the need to reciprocate.  lol  You're really mature, aren't you?  Shame on you.  Go apologize to this poor little girl, then start growing up!|`|QDem7s5baa	Totally wrong to get that upset towards a 4 yr old.Try communicating in an adult manner|`|dZtToTIbaa	Your first line says it all "She doesn't even know what a gay person is."  You should have just laughed on gone on with it.  After all she is four.  You need to apologize!|`|vXGL4maiaa	now tell her that she is preety|`|MIUzgwsTaa	Im sorry this questioning is just sooooo funny    Im taking it as you were joking but the little girl took it seriously    I hope she tattle tell on you and stick her tongue out    (I hate when my little sister do that even my big sister does that)|`|AA10153129	Buy her a flower,tell her your sorry and that she's very pretty. Tell her you were in a bad mood and you didn't mean it.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	you should never call a four year old ugly  she doesnt no what gay means. u really shouldnt of taking offence to that. like come on man! what the hell is wrong with you.|`|rISHTfK3aa	Yes, it was wrong. Remember the old saying sticks and stones. You have a lot of making up to do to get past this. When you say things like this to a 4yr old you are basically telling her things that may affect her confidence. The only way around this is to tell her the old saying and if she still says that she is ugly then you will need to tell her that you only said it in anger. She will eventually get over it but in future watch what you say.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	She's 4 years old.. She don't know what 'gay' means! Tell her your sorry and say you didn't mean anything by it. You should of understanded this by now!.|`|mpOKKyzOaa	YES!    She is only four. If I said that to my little girl my husband would have a right go at me!    X|`|uTgvbYzLaa	It's very wrong. you should have explained to her what a gay person is|`|bArpX5Rxaa	Firstly It Isn't Right! Shes 4 For Crying Out Loud!  She Don't Know Right From Wrong!  Your Much Older And Mature Than Her Act Your Age!|`|4Yw6qKyAaa	that's harsh.|`|AA10672842	I certainly hope you are kidding.Next thing you know you'll tell her she's not coming to your party.  You're not 5 are you?|`|c90TJKe4aa	laugh it off dude don't be so serious about it she will get over it|`|uJCSyJhLaa	she is a little girl...........    re u Brad Pitt?|`|448a85191a54cc7c72fb3006ad32edebaa	grow up,,,,,,,,and teach her there is nothing wrong with being gay wether you are or not! by your reaction she will think its an insult to call someone gay when its not. now on the other hand, telling someone they are ugly could be seen as just being truthful,,, has she got ginger hair?|`|boCPj0lRaa	Yes that was wrong   What a good brother you are|`|DlEwI1XPaa	figure a way out  bcz this will remain in her|`|iQfqLaRmaa	Wow. You are an idiot. Why would you get angry? She's four, she probably just picked up the word gay from somewhere and decided to use it, like four year olds do. Tell her she's pretty.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	if its notory for her to know tht ur only joking thn theres no problem but if  ure talking seriously u could make her bad psycologicxally|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	That was a very childish and horrible thing to do! She didn't know what she was saying!    Apologize to the little girl and tell her you didn't mean it. Then tell her mother and apologize to her! That little girl's going to encounter a million and one insecurities when she hits puberty, she doesn't need them now!|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Tell her your sorry.|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	Sit her down and say "sweetie you are a really pretty girl, and i was mad because you called me gay.You don't call people gay.Just like i was never supposed to say you were ugly.I sorry and i will make a deal with you.You don't call me gay and i won't call you ugly." Hope it help.If it doesn't work you can cuss me out kk? Good luck.   :))|`|KwkEvmpPaa	Dude she's a little girl what the Hell i think you need to Grow up|`|PJ9XNNhYaa	She's 4!! Do not get mad at her get mad at her parents.|`|rTLZMcQhaa	LOL now this is a joke.  i have no further comment|`|CJIZpXp8aa	It is very wrong. She possibly didn't know what she was saying, and you being the mature one should have simply explained that what she was saying was not nice and that it might make people sad.|`|31Xl7M5faa	Well a four year old would not know what homosexuality is most likely she is repeating something she heard. Four year olds love to repeat things like that.  To handle something like that I would have told her that we don't not call people names and saying such a thing hurts people's feeling. NEVER tell a child they are ugly! Not only does it lead to self esteem issues but it is just rude!|`|LX42iJyCaa	tell her you're sorry and that she not ugly..simple|`|okpAjss6aa	yess she is 4|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	dont you tink its bad enough with bdy issues as you get older kids this age shouldnt even know what ugly means-mine dont,,,you neeed to convince her shes beutiful and looks dont matter...........you have got issues if you get angry so easy|`|EsGrIscFaa	Yes. Did you actually think she was calling you gay?? You're being silly if you take the comments of a small child to heart. Grow up a bit.|`|LWXMUmFOaa	omg what age are you|`|fRl0O2XYaa	Um Sorry but yeah its wrong to say that to anyone let alone a four year old!    i mean maybe she will think that for a while now..    someone told me that (my brother) when i was like 6 and its always been around my mind making me self concious..  just og and apoligise ot her and tell her shes pretty. even if you dontn mean it! x    im sure she didnt mean that you were gay especially if she doesnt know what being gay is  x|`|YfFFzOw1aa	Yeah, its horrible to say your ugly to anyone at any age, tell her your sorry|`|0QZgZbLRaa	She's heard "You are gay" said somewhere and is just repeating it without understanding it. In a slang context gay doesn't mean gay anyway it means "uncool".  Just tell her you were joking and that she's the prettiest girl you know. She'll soon forget it.   Maybe explain kindly that you were upset by what she said to you and that she shouldn't use those words to people again.|`|e128bc4493ab14f562cac239d2828954aa	You horrible person She's 4!! at the age of 4 Gay isn't homosexual it's like you're horrible but colloquially! for christs sake! You need to apologise big time and buy her mcdonalds or something!!!|`|GSQythKYaa	You need to tell her she's beautiful and that you only said it because you were upset! It has to be you that says it as it was you who made her believe she is ugly. But seriously, she's 4. And there must be something not right if you think its ok to say that to a little girl. If i were her mother i'd be pissed with you!

Brady Neil- another one of those names, but i prefer brady with a Y- I is not a good thing  Landen Zachary- Love Landen and love Zachary ! :) they suit.

h6hNQjn5aa	hi, i've just passed this diploma so should be able to help!! The introduction exam is multiple choice and they are common sense-myself and my friends actually struggled a bit cos we're all very experienced childminders but we were told to go for the answer that is the most obvious.I think we were looking a bit too deeply into the questions!!-on some of them all the options could've been the right answer!!you have to get 18 out of 25 correct and the questions were things like;<br>  Which part of a babies daily routine do they learn most from?<br>  Eating<br>  Sleeping<br>  Bathing<br>  Dressing<br>  nappy change.<br>  i answered dressing as I thought there were more opportunities for learning e.g.you can tell the baby what colour clothes they have and count the buttons etc<br>  it only takes 25-40 minutes to do the test-just go for the most obvious answer!!<br>  good luck!!
XSEWADI0aa	Give them time, they will get over it, get caller id so your g/f doesnt have to listen to them...when you turn 18, if things arn't better by then, call the cops, they will assist you in getting your things from there house, in the meantime, keep going to school, and do your best don't give them reason for anymore complaining, your on your own now, prove your man hood.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	First, stay in school. You still have a lot to learn. Second, tell your girlfriend to use the answering machine as caller ID. Third, as soon as you are eighteen try to have the local police accompany you to your former home to collect your personal belongings.<br>  <br>  Most important, at 17 you should have obeyed the 1 a.m. curfew.  I think you deliberately defied your parents in order to create a situation which in your mind would justify leaving.  Watch that behavior, it won't get you far in life.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, learn to spell and use punctuation.|`|yKS2UI87aa	If this was their rule and you didn't bother to call and let them know where you were I would be upset as well. However that being said, I would definitely talk to your parents about not saying things like that to your girlfriend. --They should know better b/c they are adults. Tell them the old saying "if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all). (Talk nice or don't call) It's one thing to care but totally another if they are making false allegations. As far as your stuff goes ask for the things back you have purchased. If they say no I would call the police and first ask their opinion as far as maybe what to say. ie. "the police say I have every right to have my things back" Good Luck|`|qCe6GSNOaa	I am sorry that you are going through this.  I can't answer why your parents are acting like they are.  I do know that maybe they are upset and just want the best for you.  But how they are acting is wrong.  With that said, maybe stop taking their calls and send them a letter telling them that you are hurt by their words and actions.  Tell them until they calm down and try to be more understanding, you would rather stop any communications with them.  <br>  As for your personal belongings, if you paid for them, they have no right to keep them from you.  <br>  I have three sons (ages 22, 16 and 3).  I love them unconditionally.  I want what is best for them and I would never push them away.  I wish you luck and I hope that things work out for you.

Ka52nbhNaa	We tried Clomid - my RE felt that if it was going to work, it would happen within 3 cycles based on statistics in their practice.  Most doctors will not allow you to be on it for more than 6 cycles as it puts you at higher risk for ovarian cancer.    Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!

If you wish to use, why not?|`|pwC0bEmHaa	Sarah Danielle is a gud name i like that and i like Adrienne Lucia (luchia) toooo.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	I like Adaline and Gwen the best.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i like all the names you have picked  my favs are:  taryn maritza (but spelled teryn/terryn), adrienne lucia and abriele celeste  and i also like the names valerie, adaline, and gwen  maybe you could do..  valerie aria (are-ee-uh)  valerie aura  valerie serena  valerie stella  adaline annette  adaline cora  adaline lily  adaline rhea  gwen adele/adella  gwen rochelle  gwen brielle  gwen marina    i dont know about niev.. maybe for a boy  and if sarah danielle was a sister or something then their names would be different levels of commonness (for a lack of a better term) and i dont like that (sarah danielle being pretty common and the others being not so common.. at least in my opinion)|`|JNcbYYoraa	Taryn Maritza and Adaline Mariah.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I like Karidee Mariah, Abriele Celeste, adrienne lucia.    Niev...don't like it.    Sarah Danielle is alright, just very plain sounding.|`|sCAxJyHUaa	i like valerie|`|4d45ypl9aa	Taryn maritza i like this.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	i love adaline mariah as well. my older daughter's name is mariah elizabeth and it's one of my most favorite names. my younger daughter's name is also a favorite of mine and it's aurora grace. good luck with your baby girl and congrats.|`|sr1niZlTaa	Abriele Celeste  Love the name Gwen    some of the others were great names, too.  I just don't like the spellings.    ;]meg|`|DP48dIxhaa	My favorites are Karidee Mariah and Adaline Mariahhhhh. Both cute. And I love the name Sarah Danielle! I like it better than Karidee and Adaline. But Niev isnt too great...sorry|`|0hxK0khKaa	I love love love the name Valerie Karen. Karidee Mariah is a good name too.    I don't really like the name Niev.    Sarah Danielle is an ok name, but really common.|`|63899b8a7193738547e937e28a651057aa	I like Sarah Danielle.|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	My favorite is Adaline Mariah.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I like Adaline Mariah best.  Abriele, Karideen and Adrienne are nice too.|`|nrGsxWw3aa	Abriele (like in gabrielle)Celeste|`|paHt6Yi8aa	i personally like Abrielle Celeste. because it would mean clear blue sky (since i know some spanish words_celeste=sky blue) hope you agree, by the way, very nice name decisions|`|LPJcNXMVaa	yes I LIKE NEVI i ALSO LIKE Nevaeh because its heaven spelled backwards .  Also Valerie Karen|`|An6KtKBCaa	Adaline Mariah would have been my favorite choice. I like Sarah Danielle better than any on the above list.|`|AI0gPSy1aa	Niev...I'm not sure how to pronounce it. It seems to me it might be commonly mis-spelled or mis-pronounced. I like:  Taryn Maritza  and  Abriele Celeste  And I like the name Danielle but I think Sarah is rather common, but whatever name you love is most important! Don't worry about what anyone else says if YOU like the name. You'll be the one who has to call the girl that for the rest of her life! :-)   Congratulations. Hope this helps.|`|Kj9reZFLaa	I really like Abriele.  It's nice and I have never heard it before.|`|fgSugxDeaa	i like adaline mariah and abriele celeste|`|OVenWc3Paa	Thoose are all sooo pretty  My tops are Adaline, Karidee and Abriele|`|XmhYNlumaa	adaline mariah sounds good|`|TqYqQgxEaa	are these as in first and middle name because i like  Abriele Celeste...it flows...congrats;)|`|3tDqt9sXaa	Adrienne Lucia and Adaline Mariah    those are pretty names  and they are kind of different but not too out there  good choices|`|yqBNCPWJaa	If you fell in love with Niev, then fall in love with it! Who on here is to tell you if that's good enough? I think its original and definitly pretty paired with a middle name.     My favorites are the separate names themselves if they have an * before it.    Tayrn Maritza - 4/10  *Karidee Mariah - 6/10  *Abriele (I like it better with two L's: Abrielle) *Celeste - 8/10  *Adrienne Lucia - 5/10  *Valerie (cute nickname Val) *Karen - 9/10  *Adaline (Classy and cute!) Mariah - 7/10  Gwen *Renard (it's underused, but I like it for some reason[;) - 5/10  Sarah *Danielle (kind of) - 3/10|`|NOAwj4pOaa	well.. i like the names Abriele Celeste, Valerie Karen, and Sarah Danielle|`|ettfgyh8aa	Abriele Celeste is pretty. I also like the name Valerie, but not Karen as much. Adaline is pretty as well x3|`|3wjZHQV5aa	hi, reading your list of names Abiele Celeste is really lovely , i like the name Niev after i read it in a novel (its an irish name i think)    have you thought of "Niev Celeste "                     kaz
