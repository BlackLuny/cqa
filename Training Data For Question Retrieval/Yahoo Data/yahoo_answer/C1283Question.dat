20090109212712AAxdJZG	Science & Mathematics;Biology	An evolution question about evolution?	i dont believe in evolution but lets say that it was true, and an organism formed and evolved into something else around 40 billion years ago and about 6-10,000 (give or take 100,000) years ago we have man or animal. now lets go back and say that another organism formed and evolved 30 million years ago and about 4,000 (100,000) years ago we have another man or animal. so this process goes on and on with new organisms forming and evolving. so if an organism takes billions of years to form and the earth has been around for billions of years i think we should see some fish grow legs and lungs right about now. so why dont we see this?      if you dont get what im saying then feel free to email me

20090505115054AAoIdlD	Science & Mathematics;Biology	A few questions on XX/XY and Sperm?	I read somewhere that the "Y" Chromosome is considerably smaller than the "X" chromosome, and therefore females have more genes. But since both of the X chromosomes are equal, and the Y is different, would that mean that males actually have more different genes than females?      Also, how does sperm work? I mean, males are supposed to release large quantities of sperm so that only the best can reach the egg, but what determines which is the best sperm? The obvious would be that the strongest, smartest, or fittest at something would be the fastest sperm, but how? Or is the sperm's speed/resistance/sense of direction simply random?

20070303172658AAX8PUZ	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemical equilibrium...?	I'm learning about chemical equilibrium and I have a question on one of the question...      It asks, which change will increase the production of water vapor in this reaction:   2 H2S(g) + 3 O2(g)   2 H2O (g) + 2 SO2(g).       After reading one of the parts in the book, I was thinking that to increase the production of water vapor, one would need to increase the reactants. However, the answer choices are   (a) adding SO2   (b) removing H2S   (c) removing O2   (d) removing SO2      Can anyone explain the answer for this problem....      I was confused because I thought that if you remove any of the substances, you wouldn't be able to form the products, right? Is the answer (a), because if you increase the part of the products, the water vapor would have to increase to remain proportional to the SO2?

Se me ocurrió masturbarme y luego quise dormirme; pero al intentar dormirme mi cuerpo se sacudía violentamente, es decir daba un salto involuntario instantáneo. Y así ocurrió toda la noche, era imposible dormir, pues al cerrar los ojos, unos 3 segundos después, daba el “salto” o sacudida. Al siguiente día me fui a dormir a la casa de mi madre, para ver si en algo cambiaban las cosas, pero todo seguía igual. Ya en la madrugada se me ocurrió utilizar un Cirio, que según mi madre estaba bendito. Me acosté en el sofá en la sala y mi madre en su recamara. Luego encendí el cirio en una mesa a 6mts de mi, y esperé a ver que pasaba. Me quedé mirando hacia la ventana de la calle, medio acostado en el sofá.La casa estaba a media luz, con la luz del ba?o y la cocina encendida. Para mi sorpresa veo que se acerca alguien a

Part A:      The reaction between carbon tetrachloride and water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride has a  value of -232 kJ/mole and so is thermodynamically favored. But when you mix carbon tetrachloride with water, no change is observed. What is a possible explanation for this?    A- The reaction is not favored thermodynamically.    B- It is a slow reaction kinetically.    C- The activation energy of the reaction is too small.    D- The reaction is not spontaneous.      Part B:   You have some propene H2C=CHCH2CH3 in a compressed gas tank that you need to convert to propane CHCCH3 to run your cabin heater and fridge. You have another tank of compressed hydrogen gas,H2 , sitting out in your shed. Your first idea is to fill up a third tank with a mixture of the two gases, but when you try that, nothing happens. You look under your kitchen sink and find some powdered palladium mixed in inert charcoal. You take the palladium and put it into the flowpath from the hydrogen and propene tanks. As you begin flowing the mixture of propene and hydrogen, you notice with glee that by the time the gas reaches the receiving tank, it is propane gas. After all the propene has been converted to propane, you pour the palladium-charcoal mixture into a crucible. After analyzing the palladium, you notice that its chemical state has not changed.What word best describes the role that the palladium plays in the reaction between propene and hydrogen above?    A- It is a catalyst.    B- It is an activation energy barrier.    C- It is a solvent.    D- It is a reagent.

20090309102043AANDzNr	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	3 4 7 11.... Please Help!?!?!?!?!?	Anna, Jeff, Daisy, and Russ are playing an addition game. Each person has picked one of the cards shown above. To score a point, a player must roll two number cubes and get the sum equal to the number of the card already selected. After three turns, each player selects a different card from the deck.      Anna has the greatest probability of scoring a point.    Even though Jeff has a card with a higher number, his chances of scoring a point are the same as Daisy's chances.    The probability that Russ will earn a point is greater than the probability that Jeff will.    Which card was selected by which player?   What is the probability of each player scoring a point on his or her first turn?

20090309110339AAXyf8m	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Ratios and fractions?	Can some one help me remember ratios vs fractions.      From what I remember a ratio is comparing 2 quantities such as:   5 apples to 8 oranges, which would be 5:8.      A fraction is how many apples out of the total such as:   5/13. 5 apples out of 13 total.      The reason Im asking (besides just forgetting) is that every web site says ratios and fractions are equal, that is 5:8 is the same as 5 out of 8. But I though 5:8 would translate to 5/13 (using the previous example).      So for example, if 50% of all white women show symptoms of osteoporosis that would be a fraction of 1/2 or one out of 2. The ratio (I thought) would be 1:1 or one women gets osteoporosis for every one that does not.      In fractions the demoninator is the total while in ratios the entire thing is the total (5:8 means there are 13 total: 5 X to 8 Y)      I hope this makes sense.

I'll try to keep this as short as I can:   I'm graduating in a couple of years (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Tec) and am planning on moving to the US (I'm in Ontario).    I'm hoping to get a good idea for where I want to go by Winter so I can choose a co-op placement in the state, and make sure it's where I want.      I want somewhere where I can find a decent paying job (of course), but where land is a good price as I'd like to buy a house/acreage and have a small horse, possibly ranch operation.      What is farming/ranching like in the area? What are some problems you face maybe due to weather, economy, etc..?      What is the horse business like in Nevada? Can you break and sell colts for a decent amount? Is there much of a show community?      There are less jobs in my field out there then there is in say CA, but overall it seems like a better option for me.            Thanks in advanced! Any information you can give me at all would be a huge help.   (P.s. I now due to the always changing economy, that things will change when it comes time for me to move. I'm just hoping to get a better feel for it)

Life story: I am a sophomore in AP Stat., and am reviewing algebra for the SAT, etc. Just so you know that I'm not stupid, haha.       Anyway, this may be right, but it's highly unlikely:    x2 + 7x = -13. I know that your quadratic has to = 0 to use the formula, so: x2 + 7x + 13 = 0.      Plugged into the formula,    x = (-7 ± √[72 - (4)(1)(13)]) / (2)(1)    x = (-7 ± √[49 - 52]) / 2   x = (-7 ± √[-3]) / 2   x = -7 ± √[3i]          ------------               2      Is that right?

20090309143955AA7Fse2	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Does the Yahoo Answer staff have brain damage?	There is a specific and actual question. (In case the yahoo answer staff wants to delete this one too...in your quest for complete unfairness and utilization of your poorly developed evaluation skills.) It really upsets me when a perfectly good question gets deleted, due to the lack of the staffs ability to open their eyes and intelligently perceive an actual question.      Yesterday I asked this question in the Astronomy and space section:      Hear about the successful Kepler launch by NASA?      I was not only asking a legitimate question (Asking if astronomy fans saw the good news) based on the fact that a recent mission just failed (The Orbiting Carbon Observatory)...but I was calling to the attention of space program fans the news about a success of a very important mission. I had already had 4 good answers as well as a good link to the news story before the "Staff" decided to delete my question!  What is their problem??? How is this any worse than a news story question placed in the current event section? Or taking a poll or survey to see who saw something and their opinion of it? Or how about the stupid Joke section when no question is really a question? They need to change their narrow minded view point or basis of question evaluation if I am going to stay here in the future. YES... I am ranting now,  because I really HATE stupidity or UNFAIR deletions of legitimate questions which help educate or inform the public in a good way.      I will end this venting of my anger by repeating the main question which I actually would like an answer too....Does the staff suffer from some form of brain damage? (Or do they just have unqualified people doing the job of screening the questions?)

20090309144748AAp4kS7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Can you Find Flaws in The Idea?	The purposes of this device are to find a cleaner way to generate electricity by converting the energy of a moving vehicle to power lights on the highway.  Also this innovation maintains the speed limit on the highway to prevent accidents and using high-priced gas to power cars and highway lights.      1. When the bump is installed it won’t be connected for nearly two weeks storing back-up energy.   2. In daylight cars on the highway will be passing the bump and cranking it to store energy   3. Since the average sunrise to sunset timing is approximately 12 hours, the lights will be off for 12 hours while the cars pass the bump.   4. When night arrives, the CdS cell activates making the lights turn on.   5. There is a control in speed because if you drive fast towards it, it’ll propel you upwards but if you keep the speed the bumps won’t be noticeable and will not affect your driving   6. When limiting the speed there’ll be less accidents that occur.   7. If there is traffic (there’ll still be cranking).   8. If there is less daylight then dark it will still store energy when the lights are on making sure that it doesn’t become short of electricity.   9. If there is a malfunction or failure and the crank doesn’t work anymore, there is the stored energy always there for emergencies.
