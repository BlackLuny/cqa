20090226085902AAd3kBu	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Saudi Arabia	Would a boycott of lingerie stores be effective?	The Link    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7...       The Headline   Saudi lingerie trade in a twist       The Story   It would be bizarre in any country to find that its lingerie shops are staffed entirely by men.      But in Saudi Arabia - an ultra-conservative nation where unmarried men and women cannot even be alone in a room together if they are not related - it is strange in the extreme.      Women, forced to negotiate their most intimate of purchases with male strangers, call the situation appalling and are demanding the system be changed.       ...      Ms Asaad and her campaigners have now decided to sidestep both the government and the religious establishment, and put pressure directly on retailers.      Campaigners are calling for a boycott of all lingerie stores that are staffed by men.      "We the consumers are the final decision makers," says Ms Asaad. "It's we who decide what to buy or not to buy, and that's where it will hit the most - in the pocket."      Campaigners stress they still want customers' male family members to be able to enter shops, but insist all staff selling products must be women.      "The concept is flawless," says Ms Asaad. "The concept of women selling women's underwear to other women is so natural that any other option is just invalid."

20090226090115AAA4mSv	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Travelling to Argentina, long time away from daughter.?	I'm going to Argentina this summer to study abroad for 6-7 weeks. I have a wife and a 20 month old daughter, she'll be 22,23 months when I go though. 6-7 weeks is a pretty long time to be away from one's family and I was wondering if anybody else has any experience being away from their family, more specifically spouse and children, for an extended period of time. Since my daughter is so young I can't really explain to her ahead of time what's going on and she's going to be wondering where the heck I am, and it's going to be hard on my wife as well. Any advice, tips, or words of encouragement?
