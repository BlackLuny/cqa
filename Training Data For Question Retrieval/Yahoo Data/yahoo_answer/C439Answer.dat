QwWLWIZJaa	This is very common, especially in older apartment buildings and apartments where utilities are included.  At the start of winter, mgmt will shut off the AC and turn on the heater.  The heater stays on until winter is officially over...regardless of whether or not we are having unseasonably warm weather for winter or not.  You're going to have to survive by opening your windows and turning on the fan.  Or get a window unit, if your complex allows them.|`|KVHYXILkaa	I live in Denton and I feel your pain! The weather has been beautiful lately, but it can get up to 80* in my apartment without the AC on. Luckily we can use ours right now. But still, we live in a loft apartment where it is usually about 5* warmer upstairs than downstairs. I find the ceiling fan very useful (that reminds me, time to reverse it to counter clockwise!) and I also bought a $20 "stick fan" at Lowe's that sits on our night stand and blows on me. <br>  <br>  I've never heard of an apartment complex shutting off the AC during winter, but I have only lived on one so I don't have very much experience with that kind of situation. Apparently it is common, but come on, this is Texas!!! I would understand if it was Minnesota or something.

There aren't a lot of jobs out there right now in the building trades, and I bet it would be hard to get a drywalling job right now no matter if you'd been doing the trade for years, let alone as a beginner.  When the economy improves, though, lots of construction crews would like to add females to their job site, and you might like it too.  I've only done my own drywall work, well, a few small jobs for others too, but it's been self-taught, out of books and off the internet.  That works, but obviously there are tricks to the trade and equipment that makes this job go faster, and you'd learn those best on the job.|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	To expand on one of the answers already here... since there are no construction jobs out there right now, you might want to put an ad out (on craigslist maybe) for drywall work. You could find an unemployed guy who needs to feed his family who is willing to work for dirt cheap.<br>  <br>  However, since this is an educational experience too, I think you should try doing some of the drywall and THEN decide if you want to keep going with it.<br>  <br>  Drywall installation in principal is very simple. You cut out your pieces and screw them into the studs. Then use drywall tape and drywall mud to cosmetically fill in the gaps/cracks/holes. Then sand all of the dried mud until it is smooth and flat with the drywall itself. It's easy in theory, but the fact is that it can take years to get the feel for it and skillfully mud and sand and end with a nice looking wall. It is really the most frustrating thing you will ever do regarding home remodeling.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	The finishing is the difficult part, hanging it on the walls is fairly easy.

It was first grown by a farmer named Mose Coleman in 1931. At that time, sweet onions were not well known, or popular. The Vidalia onion gained much of its sweetness, largely due the lack of sulphur in the soil in the Vidalia area. Sulphur is what gives onions their pungent flavor. <br>   Vidalia onions are trademarked. You can not buy Vidalia seed, grow it in your area, and call them Vidalia onions. ***State and federal legislation defines only certain counties of Georgia,**** as producers of Vidalia Onions*********<br>  <a href="http://www.gardenersnet.com/vegetable/vidaliaonion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardenersnet.com/vegetable/vi...</a> <br>  The Vidalia Onion sets and seeds are like trying to find the needle in the haystack, it is protected by USA /read about it below<br>  Vidalia Onion producers of Georgia have protected their niche market from domestic and international competition, as well as gaining national and international recognition, through marketing, legislative protection, and research.

There are long day onions that will grow well for you that are just as sweet as the Vidalia.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	No, "organic" does not mean "baked".  Baking your soil will sterilize it.  Good if you're trying to start seeds, and think there make be some diseases or parasites in it.  But you'll also kill off all the good microbes, which help mature plants metabolize the nutrients in the soil.  Never bake your soil unless you have a known problem which baking will help, otherwise, you're actually doing more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Organic just refers to the lack of chemical herbicides and pesticides, and chemical soil additives.|`|3RBePhvQaa	i think worms are the key|`|944iJNAdaa	I think soil itself IS organic (nothing artificial has been added).  I wonder if you're confusing this with sterilization - soil isn't considered sterile until it's been heated or otherwise treated to kill off some (or all?) of the lifeforms living in it.  The truth is most potting soil isn't totally sterilized, it's typically heated to about 145 degrees.  Higher temperatures kill off so many beneficial organisms in the soil that plants don't grow as well.|`|FxWppY7Baa	As others have said, baking soil has nothing to do with making it organic. Great organic soils have a lot of organic matter, are teeming with life and have good tilth. you get this by adding composts, aged animal manures and green manures/cover crops. Also you never use synthetic fertilizers.<br>  That is what organic soil is all about.

Are all these people on mind altering drugs? Ive been getting chewing gum on my skirts since 1935 and there is only one sure way of dealing with the messy problem. Badgers droppings. You may chuckle but my grandmother used it on her skirts and so did my grandfather. You venture into the woods at night with your tools for the job, 1.Blue Denim Shoulder bag. 2. Small copper teaspoon. 3. Powerful Torch. (preferably green).4. Figs mixture with added laxotives. 5.Flask of sweet tea and a couple of custard creams.(not for the badgers,this is yours to drink while your waiting). Then you find the nearest silver birch tree and look at where the base of the tree is and there you will find the droppings. Small oval shaped pellets with a very bitter taste. (you have to try at least 4). Collect samples, put in bag, have a cup of tea, have a biccy, leave fig mixture by the base. It gives them the eartha kitts real bad!! Grind up droppings with glass mortar and the other thing and add 2 teaspoons of Hungarian Pink Adolescent Gripe water to form into a paste. Smear it on, leave for 3 weeks and voila. If it dont work first time, like it didnt for me, say **** it and go out and shoplift another skirt like i did. Hoped this helped.

AKrTZqbKaa	It doesn't matter how much you water and fertilize if you don't lime your soil. Check the Ph of your soil and get it up to about 6.5 to 7.0. If it too acidic then the nutrients in the fertilizer gets locked up in the soil and the grass goes hungry. There are other fertilizers out there that are less expensive than Scotts you can use. During the real hot months you should raise the mower to allow the grass to grow a little taller as this helps to shade the roots and soil. I usually bag my clippings and compost them. If  you cut the grass every couple of days then you can let the clippings mulch as long as they aren't too long. Usually an inch of rain per week will keep the lawn healthy. If it's real sunny and windy you may have to water a little more. Too much water and the roots get lazy because they remain close to the surface. You want them to grow down seeking it's own water, so don't water too often|`|AA10248469	Sharpen your mower blades. Bag or mulch (recycle) clippings. It provides 25% of fertilizer needs. Use Scott's 4 Step Program and follow the directions properly. Water your lawn twice a week for twenty minutes each at 4 am.  Use a timer. Your lawn will look like dynamite.<br>  <br>  The reason to  water at 4 am.  is for evaporation but for some unexplainable reason the section of lawn watered at a local golf coarse at 4 am is the richest green color on the whole coarse.

As others have already mentioned, some putty will squeeze out, and this is normal.  I keep a spoon in my tool box to scrape off the excess quickly and neatly.  It's also common to need to tighten the nut after a few days, just a bit, and wipe off any squeeze-out again.<br>  <br>  Plastic and plumber's putty do not do well together, hehehe... the putty actually attacks the plastic, causing it to be more brittle, and if its the 'chrome plate' look, it can stain the finish.<br>  <br>  Have Fun|`|AHZ7fgQHaa	Yes, you can use plumbers putty.

gY61GJu6aa	Here are the steps:<br>  <br>  1. Remove items from atop and around the toilet. Clearing items away from the toilet will keep them out of the way and will prevent any accidental drops into the toilet. <br>  <br>  2. Wipe down the toilet with a paper towel. Moisten a paper towel with hot water and wipe around the tank, lid, seat, base, and the exterior of the bowl. This removes excess dirt and helps disperse the cleaning product. <br>   <br>  3. Squirting a cream cleaner into the bowl.Squirt a liquid (cream) toilet cleaner inside the bowl. Squirt the cleaner inside the bowl, starting at the rim and making sure to get the area under the lip of the bowl. Read the manufacturer's instructions first for specific directions. Many cleaners work best if you allow them to soak on the bowl for a while. <br>  <br>  4. Scrub the bowl with a toilet brush. Brush the entire bowl thoroughly, paying special attention to mineral stains that may accumulate along the water level and at the back of the bowl. The more thoroughly you scrub the bowl, the cleaner it will get. <br>  <br>  5. Flush the toilet. Flushing rinses the bowl and the brush. Continue to scrub as the water drains from the toilet. Repeat several times to thoroughly rinse the bowl and brush. <br>   <br>  6. Spray an anti-bacterial bathroom cleaner all over the exterior of the toilet and the seat.Spray the rest of the toilet with a disinfectant cleaner. Follow the manufacturer's directions. Make sure to get both the top and bottom of the seat, and spray the entire exterior of the toilet. Use a cloth or paper towel to work in, and wipe away, the cleaner. <br>  <br>  7. Clean the handle thoroughly. Be sure to get the handle with the disinfectant spray. The handle is the primary avenue for the spread of germs, so clean it well. <br>  <br>  8. Spray the floor and tiles around the toilet with the disinfectant spray. Wipe clean with paper towels or a cloth. <br>  <br>  9. Replace items that were on or around the toilet. Put on clean gloves and rinse off the items that were on or around the toilet. Wipe them dry with a paper towel and put them back in their places. <br>  <br>  TIPS:<br>  Paper towels are ideal for cleaning the exterior of the toilet. Since they are disposable, there is a lower risk of spreading germs, and they also absorb the cleaner well and don't leave streaks on the toilet. If you use a cloth, wash it well when you're done, and wash it separately from clothes or other cloths. <br>  <br>  WARNINGS:<br>  Don't use the toilet brush to clean the seat or exterior of the toilet, as this may spread germs from the bowl to the rest of the toilet. <br>  Toilet cleaning chemicals can be harmful to you, your children, and your pets. Store out of reach of children, and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully when using. <br>  <br>  *** You can also use natural/ environmental friendly products in cleaning your toilet. Put 1/2 a box of baking soda in your toilet and leave it overnight... then follow the steps except #3. Also instead of using anti-bacterial and disinfectant sprays, you may use white vinegar and water solution (just put it in a spray bottle). <br>  White distilled vinegar is a popular household cleanser, effective for killing most mold, bacteria, and germs, due to its level of  acidity. Cleaning with white distilled vinegar is a smart way to avoid using harsh chemicals.

286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	You want to stain it, not paint it.  Behr has an excellent stain product.  Check with your Lowe's or Home Depot paint clerk; he or she will be able to direct you best.  You can get a pump sprayer and spray the stain on, but be sure you spray heavily so it soaks up into the wood.<br>  <br>  Stain lasts much longer than paint and is now available in many colors as well - or you can have color pigments added to it for a custom color.<br>  <br>  Be sure to keep an eye on your fence and restain as it fades - which should be 5 years or more if you use stain; paint will fade or chip much sooner.|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	I've never personally done a bamboo fence, but here's what i would use for a fence OR something made of bamboo (so I think it would apply in this situation)....<br>  <br>  If you like the natural look of the bamboo, use polyurethane. There's a bunch of different brands and glossiness levels, but it's the most serious finish you can use for anything like this. It essentially "plastic-coats" your bamboo, without making it look cheap and plasticy of course. Polyurethane is a little expensive, and it's kinda messy, but it will last for years and I swear by it.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for an actual paint because you want to make your fence a particular color... I would suggest something called "solid color stain." It's just what it sounds like. It's a stain (which is made to soak into wood, as opposed to paint which just sits on top of a surface), so it will preserve the wood, but you can get it in most any color. Just ask for solid color stain and show them the color you want.  Dont let them try to sell you "semi-transparent stain" This will make your wood look milky and gross. I say that because the home depot lackies who think they're experts will try to sell you something based on what they read in a 3 page overview about paint products. I hope this helped.
InoPAo6daa	Most older gas ovens were convertable  from natural gas to propane, if it is used, then it's possible it was never converted.  If it's new, then most are shipped for natural but are convertable.  If you're talking about a whole stove, with top burners as well, and it's a newer model.... pull it away from the wall and look on the back, most have the kits taped to the back of the oven.  If it's fixed in the wall.... open the broiler and look to the back, you will see the gas valve and a tube that leads to the burner assembly.  Take a 1/2 (I think) wrench, and there is an orifice you can tighten down to restrict the gas flow to the burner.  The flame should extend only to the middle of the deflector  on each side, but no more than 3/4 of the way.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Hi, the only adjustment is the air shutter and pilot on older stoves.

Otherwise, get them in the ground as soon as you can work it, rather than wait until fall.  You may not get blooms this year, but there's a chance for the following year.<br>  <br>  Let air get to them right away, if you can't plant them now.  This helps prevent mold or fungus.<br>  <br>  I forgot about some daffodil bulbs I had lifted last fall and over winter potted them in plastic pots and buried them in a leaf pile outside (the ground was frozen).

AA12139345	I'm giving a thumbs up to 'Sensible..'<br>  <br>  I can tell you as a warranty service contractor in the mobile home industry, these push fit fittings, like the 'sharkbite' start to leak as soon as 6 months, even if there was no leak when they were installed.   And I've had to make emergency runs to repair several that leaked the first time the home was pressurized after set-up.<br>  <br>  I don't even like to use compression fittings in a hard to access area, let alone these things.<br>  <br>  A newly qualified plumber should be aiming to provide the best quality workmanship and materials available -- that's how you KEEP your business going.  Cut corners with workmanship or materials, and you'll get a bad reputation.<br>  <br>  I know I'm always willing to pay more for quality, and that is what I've seen in the business world... Quality pays.  Before I retired, I was charging three times the going rate for our line of work, and I still had a 6 month back log of work.  The manufacturers were willing to pay that, because they knew the work would be done right the first time, and there would be no call-backs.<br>  <br>  If you want to be out of work in less than 2 years -- use the push fit fittings.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|N0TJqtzMaa	what does it matter what is used as long as it does the job and will last as long as the other choices,if your talking about shark bite and that type of fitting,then yes use them,and if the customer tells you what they want used then use what they want,they're paying for it.technology changes and to stay competitive you have to change with it,so do what you need to do to stay in business|`|Yx2nmc4Yaa	I think the push-fit should only be used in emergency repairs,otherwise use yorkshire fittings for a much neater job.|`|95279c3e886c01fd779498ebe313bee8aa	Use end feed or solder ring, them push on fittings are more trouble than what they're worth|`|0UHArYDbaa	I'm not a plumber, although have done plumbing as a DIYer. However I the best thing to remember is that labour costs more than materials so it is more logical to save time. That way you can maximise the number of jobs you can do and beat the competition. You can get metal pushfit fittings now too. If you want to go in between use the solder ring fittings, the solder is already inside for you, you just need to flux and heat. Cheaper than pushfit but nearly as quick and definitely neater than conventional soldering.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	The new push-fit fittings are causing quite a stir in the Plumbing industry. The IPC states that compression fittings can only be installed in areas where they are easily observed (under sinks etc). Now, they are allowing these new fittings to be installed anywhere. I post in many DIY Forums and it seems the newer Plumbers always support them by stating they have only had "a few" leaks. Sorry, but as a licensed Plumber, "a few leaks" is not acceptable. I am required to make a free call to a customer for leaks on any piping I install.

Unfortunately there is little you can do about it legally as you have no proof of purchase of his services. He clearly has no professional pride in his work and is probably hardened to any threats of court action. I know it sounds harsh but your ￡480 has bought you a valuable lesson - don't pay up until you're completely satisfied with work done.<br>  <br>  I'm sure everyone ends up in this situation at some point and it's a horrible feeling to know that someone has had you over but you've really got to walk away from it and move on. You've been fretting over this for over a month now - do you think the tiler is still worried about it? Of course not - so just let it go. The money's lost anyway so it's pointless expending a lot of time and emotion as well.<br>  <br>  You could go in for some petty revenge by reporting him to the tax office - but on what grounds? Also you don't want any repercussions from what sounds like a thoroughly unpleasant guy.<br>  <br>  As to a practical solution if the adhesives not properly set get the tiles back off and scrape the walls down again to make it easier to fix. If you still like the tiles then salvage what you can - the face and edges have to be clean but provided the bulk of the adhesive is scraped off the back you can use them again. Whatever tiles you can't salvage get the shortfall from the shop now - in case they come to the end of that particular range. If you've still got packaging left take this to the shop so they can give you the same batch if possible as the colours sometimes vary between batches. As to getting the work re-done try to get a recommendation from freinds or use the links provided by some of your other correspondents to find a reputable tradesman. Get three prices for this work and make sure they know you are getting other prices - this will keep them competitive. When they come to see the job make sure they are completely happy with the substrate (existing wall surface) to accept tiles so there will be no surprises later. As to payment a job of this size will not require stage payments and it should all be paid on completion. There is nothing wrong with cash if it sweetens the deal (his tax affairs are up to him) but you still need a reciept on letterheaded paper with the contractors name and address on. If he charges VAT then make sure there is a VAT number on the reciept. When it comes to the end of the job (or each evening if the job takes a couple of days) check it thoroughly - get into every nook and cranny. Take your time, even if the contractor is hovering over your shoulder. Don't be distracted. If something doesn't look right it probably isn't and this is your only chance to make sure the job's OK.<br>  <br>  Sorry this won't get you your money back but stop feeling angry and embarrased about being ripped off - believe me we've all been there!<br>  <br>  Good luck.

9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	It may not be entirely untrue that music doesn't help. Myth busters did an experiment where they had several green houses where they played music for potted bean plants. One green house was left without music as a control and in the end the green house which had heavy metal playing was the one with bean plants which looked the best. <br>  <br>  Now there are those who argue that the experiment has some flaws but playing music to your plants definitely doesn't hurt it. <br>  <br>  My suggestion with Rosemary is to give it lots of direct sun , plant in soil which drains well and don't over water. <br>  <br>  Another thing you should do is trim it ever now and then. This encourages your rosemary bush to bush out instead of just growing upwards. It also helps to concentrate more energy into the stems.<br>  <br>  You should also fertilize your plant. Choose a fertilizer with  nitrogen being the highest and  potassium being the next highest. Something like 10-5-7 as a general idea because the first number, 10 represents nitrogen and 6 represents potassium.  Nitrogen encourages leave growth and potassium encourages root growth. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your contest!|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Try peaceful music like Classical.

If you are up to it, it doesn't hurt to try. It's your experiment.<br>  <br>  You know what? The warmer your growing medium is, the faster your seed germinate. If your seed germinate faster for sure you'll be ahead of everybody. You can only do this by placing your pot on top of something warm and with good lightings. Your heat register for example. Make sure it got good light there.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	The best thing you can do for your plant is to give it lots of light and water as needed - don't over do it.  But for light, a grow light or old fashioned fluorescent light is really helpful.  You can keep the light on about 16 hours a day to speed things up.   Put it almost touching the plant.  A sunny window may not be enough.  Music won't help at all.   To help grow strong stems a little breeze from a fan is good.  But you probably don't need to worry about your plant outgrowing its greenhouse by May or about strong stems.  They just don't grow that fast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your project.

oD3DBOBfaa	We had a bad infestation, but finally we got rid of bed bugs with the magical powder after spending a lot of time and money on those "UNPROFESSIONAL" exterminators.<br>  <br>  We did have a so-called "professional" exterminator but they had to come back several times because the bed bugs did not go away with the stuff that "PRO" did. And finally we fed up with the"PRO" and tried sprays,foggers, and bomb..... but bed bugs were still biting us every night.<br>  <br>  Then we found BedBugPowder from the site below. It is 100% natural power and is safe to humans and pets. Just apply it on the mattress and carpet in the infected room, and bed bugs are gone.<br>  <br>  I could not believe the powder worked so efficiently after struggling with all the stuff that people said it should work.<br>  <br>  The sprays do not work unless you spray directly on the bed bugs. And they are very good at hiding, so when you spray the stuff or either the professional guy do their stuff, bed bugs are hiding in the "SAFE" place and wait till night comes.<br>  <br>  Go to the site below and you will learn a lot tips to get rid of bed bugs. And the powder does work!!!

Find a GOOD exterminator that specializes in bed bugs. You will have to wash everything you own in hot water and pack it away in sealed bags while your home gets treated. They should vacuum, steam your furniture, and spray pesticide. You will need several follow up visits over the next month or two to make sure everything is gone. After the first treatment eggs will hatch and you'll need more treatments to get rid of the new ones. And a good exterminator will also have a guarantee so if the problem doesn't go away they will continue to treat your home until the bugs are gone. Pull your bed away from the wall and put double sided tape on the legs so bugs can't crawl up. Keep your bedding off the floor. Invest in bed bug proof mattress, box spring, and pillow covers (definitely worth the cost). And caulk all of the cracks in your home, since they can live in super tiny spaces. Caulking is probably the most important step! It's a huge pain and it will take over your life but at this point it sounds like you may have a major infestation on your hands. I was lucky enough to find it very early and get it taken care of. Keep in mind that you CAN'T go overboard in preparation for treatment of your home. When in doubt, wash it or caulk it. <br>  Good luck!

Not only is environmentally irresponsible as rains inevitably move nutrients toward underground wells, streams and rivers, but also creates SURGE growth. <br>  Take some pictures of the damage and send the company a letter demanding that the lawn be fixed or entirely replace at ZERO cost to you.  If they fail to react, simply have a lawyer write a bold letter threatening court action.  Personally, I wouldn;t settle for any repair-work and would DEMAND the entire lawn be replaced by the company.<br>  <br>  Also, don't pay the bill as the company damaged your property as a result of there shotty work.

Make sure you emphasis that YOU never gave them permission to do this.  Provide any date and times of conversations you have had with their employees and then explain that because of this you do not feel you need to pay them and infact feel they should come and replace the burned spots. Provide them the pictures of your lawn. <br>  <br>  Tell them if this does not get resolve that you will file a complaint to the head company about their franchise and if that do not help you will contact your local attorney general's office. <br>  <br>  <br>  You can also call the company directly and file a complaint. <br>  <br>  # Call toll-free 1-888-872-6887.<br>  # Write to us:<br>  Scotts LawnService, Customer Service<br>  P.O.

6Hj0h5BYaa	Sink holes occur when water that is moving underground slowly erodes the dirt and creates a hole. Usually these are big problems when they're under roads or buildings.<br>  <br>  They are commonly discovered under a road, when the concrete is literally just covering a big hole and then the weight of cars finally breaks the road and now you've got a car that fell into the hole after breaking through the road. They're not always big enough to have your car fall into it. They can be the size of pot holes. But they're most notable for having disastrous results.<br>  <br>  I live in Michigan, and a couple years ago near here a gigantic sink hole developed near a bunch of houses. Roads were closed for months while they fixed it all. People's basements were affected by it, it was a mess. It was discovered that the city of Detroit had some bad water pipes running near there that had been leaking for a long time, and that underground, leaking water gradually washed away the dirt underneath a LARGE area, until all that was covering it was cement from the road.<br>  <br>  This all means that at any given time, you could be driving on a slab of cement that has a house-sized hole underneath it and you'd never know it unless you happen to be the car breaks through the cement and falls in!|`|Z5q8CCIWaa	They're really everywhere; I've got one just down the road from me, and I know they're all over town as well.<br>  The reason sinkholes occur is because some type of dissolvable rock under the ground is being dissolved by groundwater. This creates big caverns underground and eventually the top of the ground just caves in. Some are humongous and some are small. I'd recommend looking at pictures if you really want to see the magnitude of them. They're really unfortunate too, because you may never know they're there until there's a huge hole in the middle of town. I looked this up a couple years ago and I think up north the rock underneath the ground is salt and gypsum.|`|UQWusO1waa	you used the word "sink" and yahoo automatically put this in home improvement section. you mght want to post it in another section.|`|944iJNAdaa	I have one in my sink, it's where the water drains away.

9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Well the first thing is to purchase the seeds. Don't try with seeds from a tomato you took from the supermarket unless the tomato you took the seeds from is of the heirloom variety you wont be able to grow good tomatoes from the seed. Nothing like the tomato you took the seed from at least. Most tomatoes from the supermarket are not heirlooms. <br>  <br>  So after establishing that fact and you are using seeds purchased from a store try reading this article for step by step directions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reneesgarden.com/articles/tomato-from-seed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reneesgarden.com/articles/tom...</a><br>  <a href="http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/tomato/2005015135020413.html" rel="nofollow">http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/tomat...</a>|`|UQWusO1waa	heres a gardening site i like . google " square foot garden"|`|x86mC8yyaa	Plant the seeds each in a separate 3in pot, only half filled with damp peat-free multipurpose compost. Barely cover each seed with a fine layer of compost. Cover each pot with polythene or with a little 'greenhouse' top cut from the bottom of a clear plastic bottle. Put them on a sunny windowsill, or preferably in a windowsill propagator - they need warmth from the bottom, not the top, so turn off your lamp. If you have a heated propagator, you should use its clear plastic top to cover them instead of polythene. If you haven't got one, why not treat yourself to one, they're not expensive and will enable you to grow lots of things more easily. If you watered the compost and let it drain before sowing and covering the seeds, you won't need to water them again until the covers are off and they begin to dry out a bit - maybe you are overdoing the watering at the moment. <br>  Leave the seeds covered until you see them germinating, which in warmth will take 3-7 days, then remove the cover but keep them in the warm. As they grow, gently trickle more compost in to the pots so that the compost supports the thin stems, and this will also enable the plants to grow roots from the side of their stems, which makes for healthier development. After a week or two, take them out of the propagator but keep them in a warm light place.  <br>  When you pot them on, keep on doing this - plant them halfway down in the bigger pots then add compost round the stems as they grow. You'll get lovely sturdy healthy little plants that way. Good luck next time!|`|AA10567932	Using a small pot, cup, peat pot, etc. plant your seeds in a soil-less or seed starting mix, making sure to cover the seeds only about an inch of soil. Water well and allow the excess to run out of the bottom. Water carefully to make sure the seeds aren't washed away.  Put container in a Ziploc bag; close bag leaving a small opening for air and put it someplace it is warm and free of draft. Check daily to make sure soil stays moist but not soggy. Once you see seedlings appear, remove from Ziploc bag and place in the windowsill. <br>  <br>  I have used this method for years and my plants germinate faster.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3VgZSQ3baa	Try a Jiffy seed starter kit they always work for my seeds.

To force them into germination if they are still viable, you can put them in a paper towel, fold it up, wet it (not dripping), and set it in a bowl or open bag allowing exposure to air, keeping it damp.  Once the seeds put out little white shoots (after 5-7 days), you can carefully place each germinated seed 1/4 inch deep.  I often do this with huge success, especially if I only have a few seeds and don't want to waste any plants by having to thin.  <br>  <br>  Generally you want to germinate tomato seeds at about 75-80 degrees.  A heat bulb, if too close, might be too hot.  The window might be too cold.<br>  For the soil, you will want to use some type of seed starting soil or potting mix, and keep it well drained.
