It is quite alright for you to remain friends with all three of them.  You'll just have to be creative in the way that you divide your time.

f3309a0e8d010cddebf66ca3b7b4881caa	What exactly do you refer to when you say that "Moses saw a false God and was led astray?"<br>  When it comes to being worthy, I believe that The Bible is saying that no person is really worthy to God in themselves, in the sense of being without sin.<br>  (See Romans 3:21-31 and Ephesians 2:8)<br>  Only Jesus Christ is without sin, and that is why we can become considered righteous through faith in him.<br>  <br>  Here's and example that I once heard that helped me understand better; <br>  A man has big depth and has no chance to ever pay back, even if he wanted to and would work hard all his life!<br>  Then someone else offers to pay his depth.<br>  The man accept someone else to pay his depth. <br>  So, the man is considered free of depth, even though he never actually paid himself. <br>  The man is an example of people, the depth is our sin and the one who pay is Jesus Christ.|`|NNx2ep0Xaa	Moses was a fictional character.

NO ONE is worthy on their own, our only hope is the forgiveness of Jesus Who is perfect.  Once Jesus has forgiven us we are clean and able to stand before God.|`|66ge4Rzlaa	Moses claims to speak to god face to face in Exodus 33:11. John tells us in 1John 4:12 that no man has ever seen God. Who do you believe? John, via a vision from Jesus, gives us much more evidence that the god of Moses was satan in The Apocryphon of John.

Mas é óbvio que n?o foi escrita por Deus, mas apenas por um ser humano, que por sinal achei muito brilhante.<br>  O que este homem quis fazer foi apenas produzir um texto sobre como ele achava que Deus se sentia diante da criatura humana. Isto é literatura, meus caros. Me desculpem a grosseria, mas... quanta burrice! (esta é a melhor palavra mesmo).<br>  Agora quanto à carta: achei maravilhosa. E eu me arriscaria a resumí-la dando continuidade a um trecho dela:<br>  <br>  "OPTA POR OPTAR".<br>  <br>  Para mim, este foi o maior poder que Deus nos deu: somos livres para criar e escolher o nosso mundo.|`|98a26a1deba242b322f91ac8d095fae8aa	Nossa!Muito linda mesmo!!!

xuvdLhgqaa	Well I haven't done anything with YWAM. It sounds interesting so I would like to. I basically am in missions trips with my church we have a missionary seminar over here on the east coast called The Lott Carry Youth Seminar. What we do is we are a world wide based orginization who help people in what we would call Third World Countries fight against poverty, HIV/AIDS, and we also feed the homeless here in America. This Has had a major impact on my life because it makes me value things that we as Americans take for granted like having a house, a car, money, and food. My relationship with Jesus has become stronger because this helps me love and care for others like He cared for us. I am sorry that I can't really answer anything about DTS but that is good that you want to do that. I wanted to be in ministry not just as a minister of music but I feel God's call on my life to be a Pastor.

4QizPDQNaa	I can't speak for all Christians, but I don't believe I would have a different viewpoint on sex. I don't think the risk of getting an STD is the only reason why premarital sex, sex with multiple partners, or "one night stands" are not the best. Women are generally very relational people, so for most women, sex is just as much an emotional connection as it is a physical one. Many women equate sex with being an expression of love, or at least view it as some indication of a willingness to commit. I personally am not willing to offer what is most precious and personal to a man who has not made any real commitment to me. I realize that even in marriage there is the possibility that somebody will be unfaithful, but knowing that we both made a conscious decision to make our relationship official before having sex would make me feel like he loves me for me, not just because he enjoys having sex with me. Aside from STDs, there's also the chance that I'd get pregnant, not matter how "careful" I try to be. I'm not at a place in my life where I'm ready to be a mother, although I would do the best I can. When I do have kids, I want it to be with someone who is willing to stick with me in good times and bad. I don't think the Bible warns against premarital sex and promiscuity because God doesn't want us to express ourselves or have any fun. And no, I don't think sex is wrong or evil. God told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, so I'm pretty sure He's okay with the it :) It's just that we need to protect both our bodies and our hearts, and part of that is being very selective about who we give ourselves to, and when and why we do it.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	No.<br>  <br>  They don't abstain form sex because of STDs. <br>  <br>  Some just figure it's one more thing they can use to scare teenagers into not having sex.<br>  <br>  It doesn't work tho, as everyone, even teens, think it won't happen to them. So, that's why safe sex practices should be taught to teens.<br>  <br>  Interesting tidbit of information:<br>  <br>  STDs are actually on the rise in people from 50+ now. They too think they won't be exposed to them.|`|ct6cq647aa	even before people knew about std's, i think the Christian belief on sex has always been to save it for marriage.|`|BqiXEvLnaa	no, for me not getting an std was just a bonus, not the reason i abstained till i was 23 and married :)|`|pL3HVNRjaa	nope they have had these rules since before STd's werent even on the raidar|`|THRtsl83aa	I can't speak for all, but only for myself.  I believe you shouldn't be having sex until you're ready to accept the responsibility of having a child (after all, that's the ultimate purpose of sex).  My stance on the issue has nothing to do with STD's.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	No.<br>  <br>  There are may other reasons sex is saved for marriage.|`|hmU2udmRaa	no, when a man shows up at your door with a goat in a exchange for your daughters hand in marriage, it is meant to be a sacred union, where the woman does not have a say in the matter.  why can't people realize the simple concept of marriage?  no livestock, no nookie.|`|Jsqlkb3caa	No...in fact I am pretty sure that a good portion of Christians will tell you that STD's were made by God to punish the sinful acts of humanity. At least thats what I was told growing up in my "oh so *loving* church". <rolls eyes>|`|AA11503457	Though that would be great, no.

WX1b747Iaa	Monotheism encourages an us-centric view, everything is on their terms according to them, because theirs is the sole legitimate way of being.

HqG4MDxGaa	To me? Yes, definitely, given as how I'm a fellow Christian who's studied Astronomy in depth, to a certain degree. But there is not just ONE black hole, there are several so do that mean that hell's divided up into different "sections", as suggested in Dante's Inferno? Seriously?|`|qpCUvqq8aa	A black hole is a celestial body so dense that light cannot escape its gravitational pull. It is formed when a star's gravity causes it to collapse into itself. Usually, pressure caused by heat from burning up hydrogen and other fuels balances out the star's gravity. However, when the star runs out of fuel, it is overcome by gravity and proceeds to collapse. A smaller star, with a mass less than one and a half times that of the sun, becomes a white dwarf. A star with a mass more than one and a half times that of the sun becomes a neutron star or, if it is massive enough, it collapses to a small point of great density-a black hole.<br>  <br>  Because of its large mass, the black hole has a gravitational pull from which even light cannot escape. Light rays passing near the black hole are bent, and if they come close enough they are sucked in or trapped in orbit around the black hole. The trapped light rays define the event horizon of the black hole. The event horizon is the boundary past which nothing can escape from the black hole. Approaching the event horizon, time seems to slow down. A gravitational redshift occurs, as light turns red because it loses energy trying to escape from the black hole. Inside the event horizon, predictability and the laws of science break down in the presence of a singularity, or infinite curvature of spacetime. Because of its infinite density, the singularity causes all time and space to be the same. Meanwhile, the tidal forces, where the gravitational pull of the singularity is stronger closer to it than further away, tear matter apart as it nears the singularity.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is no|`|nrXCCf76aa	I'm not sure, that's very interesting, though. I personally believe that hell is in the core of the earth being like how the judgement of demon locusts, came out of the middle of the earth and in Rev, also, about how they casted satan into the center of the earth, or like opened up the earth. <br>  <br>  And, notice that the center of the earth is like a lake of fire. <br>  Hope it helps(:|`|NsHV4O8oaa	um... no a black hole is when a star collapses greatly under its own gravity - its not hot, otherwise nuclear fusion would take place and possibly 'break' the black hole<br>  when are you christians going to realise that hell isn't a place of torment since we die when we die, we don't live on and hell in the bible actually means grave (literally cover over as in helling potatoes)<br>  what a stupid argument...<br>  <br>  edit* yes, well maybe a blackhole is defined by man, but your 'special' definition of hell is defined by you! and atleast man has ALL the laws of physics on his side aswell...<br>  turning physics into theology...|`|XCEzTAyUaa	No, you lack an understanding of what 'proof' is. By not being able to prove something, doesn't automatically make something else prove it - if we worked on that system, a lot on inocent people would be in jail ;)<br>  <br>  You've simply proved black holes exist ;)|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	No, but they're proof that black holes exist.<br>  <br>  "Has man ever collasped a star to prove it?

S5AZE2Ixaa	Well, you know, when I was poor and could not find a good job, I would see people laugh at me and look down on me as well as patronize me. Now that I am working overseas with a good salary ( thank God for that) and they are back home going thru the crisis, I am tempted to gloat and say- Aha Now it is your turn to suffer so you would know how I used to feel. These bad/.sinful feelings do come up, but I pray to make them go away since I know it is no good to gloat.<br>  I do feel bad about innocent people who did not look down on me, I just pray that they overcome the crisis as soon as possible.<br>  But Americans are resilient, and this will make everybody stronger, wiser and more patient.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	You can be happy and survive any hard times.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	If you think people losing their jobs and their homes is funny yes you are a bad person with a sick mind.

Living on unemployment while I look for work is causing me to fall behind on my bills and now I may have to relocate just to find a job. <br>  <br>  Does it make me feel better to know others are suffering too? HeII no it doesn't. How does someone else going through hard times make anyone feel better?|`|GPznIhzMaa	When I hear about people losing their jobs because of the economic downturn, I'm seized with fear and anxiety. It's no laughing matter. <br>  <br>  In 2008, I was laid off from my first job out of college. Because I live on my own and pay all my own bills, I fell behind on bills as well as racked up some credit debt. The unemployment check wasn't enough to cover my living expenses-- it barely covered my utilities. It also took an emotional toll on me and I started suffering from panic attacks. Since then, I got a new job but I have a lot of friends who were laid off. No, it doesn't give me any joy to know they're out of work. Even though it was tough in the beginning of 2008, the job market wasn't as bad as it is now. So instead of being out of work for just a few months like I was, my friends will be out of work for even longer.

It didn't say anything about loving only your white neighbor. This is part and parcel of where the modern form of Christianity goes haywire. It seems as though every sect claims to have cornered the market on the truth. There are, as Burton Cummings said,"Too many churches, not enough truth." We're not very good at following the ten suggestions or turning the other cheek. Our ego, pride and vanity keep getting in the way of any true relationship with God!

They can decide how much each puts into the joint account depending on incomes and however they wish to choose.  They need to decide finances before moving in together; they need to decide how to handle changes like a job loss or other loss of income; and they need to decide what gets paid jointly and what gets paid personally.  It's a very important discussion to have before moving in together.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	There are 'benefits' to all of the options...theirs/mine...theirs/mine/ours...  I've considered each of them throughout the years, but have decided, for me, that 'ours' is best...and here's why.  As a 'couple', whether they're married, engaged, committed, 'civil union', etc., one party usually has a higher wage than the other.  It can mathematically be figured out who makes the higher percentage...then the higher wage earner pays their 'percentage' of every bill and the lower wage earner pays their 'percentage' of every bill...  But why all the fuss?  When two people become as one they should pay the expenses 'together' wanting the 'best for each other'...  If there's 'so much concern' about who pays what and how much...I'd encourage them to 'reconsider' becoming 'one'...because they're only thinking of themselves...and 'that' just doesn't work in a 'one' partnership...|`|FpMS47sXaa	I don't think it's really an obligation, but to me, it says a lot about trust.<br>  <br>  My partner and I share EVERYTHING.

Especially if there are two incomes coming into the house.  You find out how much each person contributes to the community pool and what that pool is for, and then they each manage the rest of their own money.  As long as someone isn't needlessly raiding the others funds then there is no real issues.  It really works well for couples that have different spending habits.

I wouldn't not let my children listen to it (if I ever had children) because finding your own tastes/distastes is fundamental when characterising your personality. My parents didn't really restrict me from listening to it, I'm almost 17 and I am now very aware of what I like, don't like. What I find acceptable and unacceptable. I think the lyrics in Hip Hop shouldn't be taken too seriously. I can listen to a Biggie album for the whole day whilst he talks about gun violence, murder, robbery, suicide and still go out with my family in the evening and be civil. <br>  <br>  I think people find certain music genres such as Hip Hop as an excuse, or a fall back on a more controversial issue. Saying that, Hip Hop does no good for the society we live in, especially if you are black. When you associate yourself with Hip Hop lifestyle you should be prepared for the stereotypes that will presume as a result; stupidity, violent, thuggish, criminal, untalented. If you aren't prepared to be stereotyped as a black Hip Hop artist then you shouldn't become one, and the same for fans. It's like a sacrifice. I just don't take the music too seriously and don't let it disrupt my life.|`|9KBqN0KAaa	Well that style of music is tagged to the stereotype of black gangsters.<br>  However that is only really by people who don't listen to it and don't understand it or the culture.<br>  <br>  It's the same with a lot of punk music or punk arstists, they're tagged with the racist and arrogant stereotype but people who listen to that music or who are involved with or understand the culture normally disagree.<br>  <br>  It's really just boils down to ignorance, and lack of understanding things.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Rap is bad. Don't let your children listen to it.|`|KF8CHY2faa	For starters, a large majority of African Americans have either grown up in, or is currently living in the environments that are described in rap/hip hop music. So many of us can relate to the content being projected over the beats. Not only black people, but people of all races either have lived, or know someone who's pretty much 'living' in the songs themselves (i.e. renting apartments and homes in lower income communities, receiving government assistance, even selling drugs or their bodies to make ends meet). And because poverty, hopelessness, discouragement and despair are all conditions and emotional states felt by people world wide many people are able to sort of seek refuge within the lyrics. It makes them feel as though they're not the only one's experiencing hardship. <br>  <br>  But on the other hand, many in the black community (especially) feel that there has to come a time when these lyrics must be reversed and preach positivity within our communities. Honestly, you can only play the 'victim' role so long before it becomes as 'broken record'. I personally am sick of hearing the same material being repeated over and over again by various rap/hip hop and r&b artist (money, hoes, clothes, rims, drugs, and jail time). When did going to jail, having children with different women/men, living the ghetto and being a drug dealer become cool? When did being uneducated become 'the in thing' and why is it ok to wear your pants below your @$$? All these things mentioned are the negative images that are not only being projected by the artist from our communities, but are the images that our youth 'buy' into when purchasing the CD's of these artists. And then we wonder why the largest population of prison imamates are African American males, our young women become unwed young mothers before they graduate high school (if they even graduate), and we stay in the same 'rut' that we complain about "The Man" is keeping  us in. If you believe this is all you’re worth, then this is all you will become.|`|XXMhrJSSaa	Maybe becuz mainstream artist are nothing far of "bad role models". Mainstream Hip Hop promotes all the wrong things with the black community, sex, drugs(not in those words), cars and bling bling. I don't call out artists in general, when its not their jobs to be role models. But you can't help but wonder how the parents of those kids who idolize these artists feel, when they hear their child cussing and what not.<br>  I do believe that the Hip Hop artists with the right message don't get the airplay they deserve, but you have to remember this is America, and in America what sells is what works.
X1j7qYkUaa	cheating is evaluated by the rules defined by the parties involved in a relationship and no other. However the moral majority would likely view it as cheating, but yet the majority often draws swords as to define what cheating is.  <br>  <br>  In general the exchange of fluids and heavy petting would be considered cheating by said majority. And there are still several more that even view masturbation (alone) as cheating, particularly when it comes to those that require toys, visual or other stimulation. <br>  <br>  Thus the rules of what constitutes cheating and respect for our partners and our relationships requires open discussion and heavy negotiation from the first moment we recognize it may be serious. Albeit often that majority wants to leave it to the idea of telepathy, of moral relativity and the presumption of following the same playbook as represented by the majority although often tossing out a few rules, and lengthy rituals, discussion shortened to good will sentiments found on a gift card, with a receipt that offers exchanges.<br>  <br>  But as to the other question,  <br>  <br>  Sex of itself is actually pretty irrelevant to sexuality. <br>  <br>  an erection or an orgasm isn't a clear sign of attraction, even enjoyment. <br>  <br>  Sexuality and attraction is a gray area. But in truth, I could have sex with a mate and not be attracted to him, not even have it affect my sexuality. Then again, being a bi genderfag leaves a lot of room.<br>  <br>  If a straight woman doesn't have sex for 40 years... is she still straight?<br>  <br>  If someone gets raped by someone other than their prefered gender, does it change their sexuality - not related to their own questions, but the fact of the act? If they have an orgasm from said event, does it mean they enjoyed it?<br>  <br>  Does rubbing against your toys when you were a toddler, really mean that you're just a plushie-luver in denial now that you've moved on?<br>  <br>  What is the sexuality of someone who uses a gloryhole? -- if you have no concept of who or even what is on the other side, what does that really say about your sexuality or even sexual acts. <br>  <br>  Sexual acts don't define sexuality anymore than a haircut. <br>  <br>  I know plenty of straight dudes that enjoy being on the receiving end of anal. And some that never had any homosexual experiences... however the concept here is likely to drive that a male on the receiving end of anal is a homosexual or at least bi.<br>  <br>  The concept is flawed... if you think you're gay, well homo, you're gay. <br>  <br>  If you believe your straight, even though you gave out every kind of job imaginable at sleepaway camp when you were a kid, you're still probably straight. <br>  <br>  If my boyfriend was born a girl, and despite that I have the tackle, my genes say I'm something else, what would you call us?<br>  <br>  Even my massive head is too small to really understand the playing field, because we're trapped by language and definitions... by roles, by assumptions, by presumptions, by belonging to categorizations in groups that many don't even want us... because we don't represent an ideal. <br>  <br>  The politics of sexual acts as defining sexuality is a no go.... I'm as much of a homo when I'm not having sex with whatever qualifies as male as I am a breeder when I am, because my "attractions" more than just the physical aesthetics... in simple and complexity, I am attracted the more than one rigid form of gender, gender identity, gender roles or gender expressions.<br>  <br>  Sex can be meaningless...  whether you put something in your mouth, in your bum or anywhere else it fits or put yourself in someone or someone else.  <br>  <br>  Because if sexuality is rooted down to the definitions of sexual practices, then the only time sexuality is irrelevant is when you're having sex - by whatever definition sex may take. <br>  <br>  Though Fable II defines celibate as a sexuality... so maybe it's a go. <br>  <br>  And when it comes to oral... chances are you've had worse things in your mouth.  Why would I give a damn if a bro wants to say he's straight, but he's a little something other on the downlow.<br>  <br>  If you want to define it then it's a homosexual act. that's it... but it doesn't mean he's a homo.  <br>  <br>  And if mutual masturbation has the ability to define sexuality of itself, then I'm going to take it a step further and say any and all physical contact does, that physical you got from your non-prefered gender doctor, affects your sexuality, I don't care how many times you cough, whether you were hard or soft, tight or loose, that all contact sports, particularly in the major leagues count as a homosexual act as well. There are more gropes on the field than the bath houses.... hos.<br>  <br>  Sexuality is a question of attraction.... and I'd go to say it's more than physical lust, because attraction isn't sexual of itself either,  but the games of gender is a whole another playing field, because all this gets summed up in roles and expectations, roles of gender, roles of sexuality and moral obligation, obligation to the majority's perspective rather than the imp|`|63c199397a307505e128e69aead4d08daa	I think if it's the first time for both of you then you could chalk it up to "curiosity", but if it happens again with any guy then you're either bi or gay. I think if you only use your hand on each other you might get away with calling it masturbation, but any time one person's body parts enter another person's body that's considered having sex. (Are you listening, Bill Clinton??). If either of you is in an exclusive relationship with somebody else then this would be cheating. If you have a girlfriend but you and she are still seeing others as well, then this wouldn't be cheating.|`|KsubM4Y2aa	Yes, they are still straight just like a white guy can tan a LOT or get painted black, but he's still white.<br>  Or a guy can dress and totally look like a woman, but is still a guy.<br>  <br>  If you are gay it means you feel towards guys like a straight woman does. What you actually do on the other hand is something completely else. It's not like a gay guy is straight if he does a woman.<br>  <br>  Now as for bisexuality, it's hard to know how much you have to like it to be bisexual. I mean, it's possible to make even a straight guy fall in love with another guy. It probably takes some ignorance, but it's possible.<br>  <br>  It's relatively impossible to draw lines. I always thought I was gay, but I lately got confused yet again...<br>  <br>  It's all probably so, because we are raised to be ashamed of being humans. We think it's wrong to be naked. That might seem normal to us, but objectively it's a mental disorder to feel guilty when naked.<br>  So, given we live in bullshit of our ancestors it's not odd we don't know ourselves.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	that's actually a pretty good question without any easy answer.  Basically, if one or both of the men find other men attractive in any way then they are bisexual or gay.

It definitely counts as sex and is very different from masturbation.  Not sure if the girlfriends would count it as cheating though. Hmm.|`|7qOQL85saa	I would say straight, but not completely straight... :D<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I wrote "stay straight". Whoops ^^;|`|ee65f538f085527a78cd622269657a19aa	Sounds gay all the way to me.  A normal man would'nt even think of submitting to doing this.|`|7nHuDxivaa	maybe its not totally gay, but at least bi|`|BuyzuOEjaa	no, but can be bi|`|T8ksKCWCaa	That is not straight behavior.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No, they are not straight. A straight guy would only give a guy oral if a gun was to his head. If he willingly does it, he's either bi or gay. There is no such thing as helping each other out when it comes to sex otherwise, you could use anything from dogs to little boys to holes in the wall to "help out". It's much different from masturbation. Not so much as it's because people are of the same gender but even if it were a man and woman, beating off and getting head are two totally different things.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's gay to sit in the company of another dude watching porn anyway. If you're mutually masturbating, that would just solidify my thoughts. You can't sit there acros from or next to a guy who has his dick out and is yanking on it, and not look over at least once. You can't look over once and not be affected because either you're gonna get turned on or turned off. My husband told me that sometimes young guys might do something like that, and although that still makes it kinda gay in my mind, that's the only way I can see it as innocent somewhat. <br>  <br>  I like gay porn so the situatation you're describing seems as something that would happen on a gay (or adult) movie. It sounds hot, as I sit and think about it.<br>  <br>  Oh, and yeah.. that's cheating.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	If they were teen boys experimenting, they might still be straight.<br>  <br>  They would love the feeling of orgasm in any case, but would sooner or later come to the realization they'd prefer being with a girl.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:<br>  <br>  -- If you crush on guys and fall in love with guys, you are gay, whether or not you have sex with a guy.<br>  -- If you don't crush on guys and fall in love with guys, you are straight, whether or not you have sex with a guy.<br>  <br>  It's just that a predominantly straight guy in his 20s or older probably would not prefer sex with another guy.<br>  <br>  Now...as to whether this would be cheating on their girlfriends...<br>  <br>  Well, I think so, only because I reckon if the girlfriends found out they would probably not be happy.  I'm sure the girls would see it as cheating.<br>  <br>  It's different from masturbation in that another person is involved.|`|dqszKQfBaa	Yes, they are still straight. The problem with people and defining sexual orientation, is that people place two much emphasis on sex. For a person to be gay, you have to be emotionally physically exclusively attracted to the same-sex. If two straight guys that are attracted to women 95% of time have oral sex with each other once, I think they're still straight. Remember, people are rarely 100% gay or straight.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	They are still straight.  But they have engaged in "gay sex".  I suspect that lots of straight men have done this at some time in their lives<br>  <br>  If they had partners, they would  have cheated.  I define sex as stimulation of the genitals by another person.|`|rxScdXM4aa	no they are not straight and that would be seriously gay.<br>  <br>  no true straight man wants another guy touchin his magic stick<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and masturbation can be mutualbut not between 2men and not be gay|`|fdU4rJXCaa	If 2 straight guys give each other oral, they are not necessarily bi or gay, but they have engaged in gay sex. There would have to be a real sexual attraction for them to be bi or gay. However, as they both did this willingly, one might infer that there is in fact some sexual attraction...so they probably are not completely straight.<br>  Yes, it counts as sex...they have stimulated each others genitals and penetrated each others mouths...that's why it's called oral sex.<br>  Yes, it's cheating...they are having sex with someone other than their girlfriends.<br>  Yes, it's different than masturbation...oral sex is even beyond mutual masturbation by hand, as it involves penetration of the oral cavity.|`|e0lfV7skaa	Straight guys wouldn't give each other oral sex at all.  The most they would do (assuming they're over 15), would be to jerk off in front of each other.  <br>  <br>  Bu assuming they're past the early teens experimentation age, they wouldn't do this and be straight.<br>  <br>  And if they're involved in other relationships, then yes, it is indeed cheating.|`|Oo1FI3Mkaa	At this point it doesn't necessarily mean that they are not straight.  You didn't mention the ages of the guys, but it is common for young males to experiment during adolescence.  Since sexual orientation is decided before birth and is not a matter of choice, the sexual experimentation does not usually matter.  However, if this sort of thing continues beyond a one time or rare occurrence, then there is cause for concern.|`|4HClQObFaa	If they enjoy it then they are at least a bit bi.<br>  <br>  But I can imagine a situation where that happens and they both dislike it and each other.<br>  <br>  If it is unforced as you suggest then I'd say they were more than a bit bi.<br>  <br>  And yes it undoubtedly is sex.<br>  <br>  And yes it is cheating.<br>  <br>  And yes it is different from masturbation (way better)!|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Honey, they're GAY...  I don't care whether one calls mutual masturbation or mutual oral sex one thing or the other...IT'S STILL SEX...and if both parties are of the same gender, then they're either bi or GAY!  If, and I repeat "IF", they were even close to being straight, the very thought of having any kind of sexual relations with members of their own sex would be disgusting...|`|WDbE5gffaa	Yes.<br>  They are still straight, because they are straight guys.<br>  If they enjoyed doing it to the other guy, or were turned on by it, they wouldn't be straight guys, right?|`|61c8oevtaa	That would count as sex and it would definitely count as cheating, but it doesn't make them gay. It means they're "curious", or just really horny!<br>  <br>  =]|`|a87202188ac306b67714d9e45d2bc435aa	if a guy sucks another guy off..he is at least bi....no way around it...

d0600880a83eef4da79264e4dc7c8f12aa	Jesus lived in Nazareth until he was 30 years old. Then he went to John to be baptized. Following his baptism, Jesus embarked on his dynamic ministry. For three and a half years, he traveled throughout his homeland declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom. He gave evidence that he had been sent by God. How? By performing many miracles—powerful works that were beyond human ability.—Matthew 4:17; Luke 19:37,?38.<br>  <br>  Jesus was also a man of tender warmth and deep feelings. His tenderness was especially evident in the way he viewed and treated others. Because Jesus was approachable and kind, people were attracted to him. Even children felt at ease in his presence. (Mark 10:13-16) Jesus treated women with respect, even though some in his day looked down on them. (John 4:9,?27) He helped the poor and oppressed to ‘find refreshment for their souls.’ (Matthew 11:28-30) His manner of teaching was clear, simple, and practical. And what he taught reflected his heartfelt desire to acquaint his listeners with the true God, Jehovah.—John 17:6-8.<br>  <br>  Using God’s holy spirit to perform miracles, Jesus compassionately healed the sick and the afflicted. (Matthew 15:30,?31) For example, a person with leprosy came to him and said: “If you just want to, you can make me clean.” What did Jesus do? He stretched out his hand and touched the man, saying to him: “I want to. Be made clean.” And the sick man was healed!—Matthew 8:2-4.<br>  <br>  Consider, too, an occasion when a crowd who came to Jesus stayed with him for three days with nothing to eat. He felt pity for the people and miraculously fed the “four thousand men, besides women and young children.” (Matthew 15:32-38) On another occasion, Jesus calmed a storm that threatened the safety of his friends. (Mark 4:37-39) He resurrected, or brought back to life, those who had died. (Luke 7:22; John 11:43,?44) Jesus even willingly gave his perfect human life so that imperfect mankind would have a hope for the future. What profound love Jesus had for people!

wnsFO3GCaa	A few months ago I discovered that I was blocked by a guy who I had never heard of. I hadn't ever seen a question of his let alone answered one. Since I hadn't had any contact with him I figured he was a trouble maker so he has been on my block list ever since. <br>  <br>  The only way to find out is to try to open a question and if it says 'You cannot view this question at this time' then you are blocked. There have been some problems on Y!A recently and lots of error messages have popped up when trying to answer questions, these do not mean you are blocked.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Yes, a person who goes by redco... <br>  <br>  He apparently did not like my answers. He contacted me and we had a correspondence going for a short while. Then he sent me an email putting me down by saying I didn't sell much art. <br>  <br>  I would have agreed with him. But he blocked me from further discussion.<br>  <br>  When he posts a question I see it has a red icon displayed.

This is why the jews or the people that crucified Him are still waiting for their Messiah for they didn't believe Jesus was the one that was to come (for they expected a Messiah that was rich, that dressed like a king, one who had control of everything and many soldiers to back him up) and that is why they crucified him.<br>  <br>  Do your research on all the Bible and you will see that the gospel Paul preached is the same gospel our Lord Jesus Christ preached.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|hJX6Ur3taa	Read the stories about the Last Supper.

The proposal is then put to the female by this person.The proposal must be considered by the family and the girl.This is done because a marriage is really the union of two families and it is the duty of the wali to determine the suitors character,if he is kind,generous pious etc.So there must be two yes's for a marriage to go forward,one from the family the other from the girl.If one of the parties does not accept then the proposal is declined.<br>  <br>  Often if the man is young,he will speak to his neareast male relative,his father most likely,and ask him to submit the proposal.This way the two families can get a chance to connect and decide if that is the best thing.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions of course.In the prophets case,his first wife proposed directly to him through I think it was her cousin (Im not sure about his relationship to her).<br>  <br>  For further reading,I suggest you google, "The book of marriage/hadith on Islamic marriage"|`|5Rn5BHjQaa	There are no examples of marriage proposals in the New Testament. That implies that there's no "proper" method, and you can use your own judgment as long as it's done with love and respect.<br>  <br>  In the Old Testament, proposals often (but not always) involved a go-between. Abraham (looking for a wife for his son) sent his servant, who asked the chosen girl in front of her family. David sent a messenger to Abigail. (Note that they both asked the prospective bride for her consent; they didn't bargain for her behind her back as if she were a donkey or a sack of wheat. Even though it was a highly patriarchal society, women were shown more dignity than that.) Naomi "proposed" directly (but nonverbally) to Boaz, so it doesn't even have to be the man who initiates the proposal. <br>  <br>  So, the bad news is, there's no "correct" pattern to follow to make it easier. The good news is, God lets you express your own personality and honor your beloved's preferences when you propose.|`|BBhVUNKOaa	i really dont know.. but you ask the parents for permission.|`|4Uyv7T5Vaa	What Quran Says About Marriage?<br>  (Nakah)<br>  <br>  Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves, male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah encompasseth all, and he knoweth all things. [24:32]<br>  <br>  Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum), give them such a deed if ye know any good in them: yea, give them something yourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them, yet, after such compulsion, is Allah, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to them), [24:33]<br>  <br>  Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry and but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. [24:3]<br>  <br>  Do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe: A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you. Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe: A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelievers do (but) beckon you to the Fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they may celebrate His praise. [2:221]<br>  <br>  And marry not women whom your fathers married,- except what is past: It was shameful and odious,- an abominable custom indeed. [4:22]<br>  <br>  Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled. [33:37]<br>  <br>  There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in terms Honourable, nor resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah Knoweth what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. [2:235]<br>  <br>  O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner. [33:49]<br>  <br>  And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do. [2:237]<br>  <br>  So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand. [2:230]<br>  <br>  When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst you, who believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is (the course Making for) most virtue and purity amongst you and Allah knows, and ye know not. [2:232]<br>  <br>  Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account. [4:6]<br>  <br>  If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing in|`|8ytLLHV4aa	I don't think it's considered significant in any of the 3 religions.

1q3sElDQaa	The exact same thing happened to me. I feel in love with my BEST friend and when I realized it, I couldn't look past that fact. I finally told her when we were talking online about the feelings I had for her (I wasn't as brave as you were). She didn't know how to take it, but she definitely didn't have the same feelings for me. It was the first time I had ever felt that way before about a girl, but also like you, I was in love with her from the time we met. After she found out about my feelings, we didn't talk or hang out for months. I know I wouldn't have been able to do so without always having those thoughts and feelings in the back of my mind. <br>  <br>  Months later we slowly started hanging out again and she had a boyfriend. I thought it was enough time to get over her, but it bothered me every time I saw them together. At the same time though I missed having her around and it was the best feeling ever so I dealt with it. 6 months later, she kissed me. We've been together 6 years and counting now. <br>  <br>  I know that I'm not giving you too much advice, but I wanted to share our story with you to let you know that things can happen when you least expect them. Don't give up just yet. Give her some time. You have to remember that it's probably not that easy for her either. She might be struggling with the same feelings inside. Don't make anything happen, just let things work out on its own. If you try to hard to either stay with her or forget her, in the end you'll just be hurting yourself with all that effort. I hope everything works out for the best!|`|fdMKpXCHaa	First, if you really love her and your friendship is so great, why would you cut her out of your life just because she won't have sex with you?

Don't expect anything from her. Don't even think for a second it's realistic. She's just your friend until she says otherwise (which is probably never).|`|def5a09227026f35fdf522dffb561e8caa	I wouldn't suggest moving on or breaking up the friendship.

But in the pleasures of worldly life and in animal life he falls a hundred times lower. For in each pleasure he receives is the trace of thousands of pains. The pains of the past and fears of the future and the pain at each pleasure’s passing spoil the enjoyment to had from them, and leave a trace in the pleasure. But animals are not like that. They receive pleasure with no pains. They take enjoyment with no sorrow. Neither the sorrows of the past cause them suffering, nor the fears of the future distress them. They live peacefully, and offer thanks to their Creator.<br>  This means that if man, who is created on the most excellent of patterns, restricts his thought to the life of this world, he falls a hundred times lower than a creature like a sparrow, although he is higher than the animals.|`|FN8meC6taa	animals have more worries than us.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	While all genres of Christian music essentially glorify God, I fell like Christian rock is one of the worst.  A ton of the music is simply re-writing old worship songs with rock music.  The original stuff relies heavily on short, unimaginative, repetitive lyrics aimed at the single focal point (God is great, Jesus is the savior), but anybody listening already knows the point.<br>  <br>  Why can't Christian music be creative and entertaining?  I know the hearts of the artists are in the right place, but at times it seems like they aren't even trying.  The Bible, New and Old Testaments, are rich with history and lessons that could easily be adapted to music (especially rock music, such as ballads).  <br>  <br>  I can imagine God hearing Christian rock and thinking, "Gee, another song where 3/4 of the lyrics are the word "holy", guys, I appreciate it, but could you entertain Me a little bit?"|`|2Hot9EJiaa	The music itself is  not what glorifies God, it is the heart. So if Christian Rock does not say anything that goes against Scripture then it is absolutely ok to listen too. I know some young people that have come to know Jesus through a Christian Rock Concert.  If the lyrics are God honoring, of course it is ok.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I listen to Christian rock, I don't see the problem.

No comment.  So, "Let everything that has breath (by the way, drums make noise by air...or breath) Praise the Lord."<br>  And, why should the devil have all the good music...|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	Absolutely it does glorify God and praises Him. Why would it not be good for you? I firmly believe that many of the songs coming from Christian rock are inspired by God. They are inspirational and uplifting and declare God as the one and only God of the universe. Join them praising and loving God it will take you to the throne room of God.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	All I can say is if God likes it, he has a lot worse musical taste than I thought.  Most of it's really bad stuff, musically speaking; I can't imagine anybody listening to it for long who has any kind of real musical training, or even a pretty decent ear!|`|K3PR7Mivaa	I think God can use all things to speak to people heart.<br>  It also would depend on the actual song, not all Christian music is sincere, some do it because they can't make it in the major music genres,-rap,country,pop, rock etc etc. But they have talent and it can catapult them into fame of sorts. We all have those that are saved the Holy Spirit that can help us discern the sincerity of the song and the artist behind it.  I try to listen for the meaning behind the lyrics, to see if its lifting up and glorifying the Lord or just having a form of godliness and deny the power there of, which often tends to be the case. We have to be careful also that we're listening to the song not just for the sound or music sake. But if it sounds like the world or can be confused for the world, then I would wonder if it's ,really pleasing to God, because He said be not of the world  be separate and come out from among them... there should be something different about the song or music style in general that sets it apart and should draw us closer to Christ. Not all is bad, not all is good..if we put it before God's Word or substitute it for our worship and praise in Prayer..its wrong too<br>  Your right though everything we do should be for His glory honor and Praise.|`|pakIAYWoaa	this is an area of personal preference as weather you like it or not...God always looks at the heart and if your heart is loving God praising him, worshiping him without hypocrisy God doesn't care if its country, rap, hymns, gregorian chant, or bongo drums.  There is one scripture where Paul says I am all things to all people so that some may gain Christ; on the other side it does say do not imitate the world or the things in the world...The scripture is not clear but God discerns our hearts with perfect clarity, I will worship in Spirit and in truth no matter what medium is being offered.|`|NjSWQFBYaa	I don't think that there is any form or type of music that is any more or less holy than any other.it depends on the lyrics,combined with the tune, and how it makes you feel.|`|AA10733606	The music has nothing at all to do with whether or not it glorifies God, it is all in the words.<br>  As long as the words are glorifying God then the music genre does not matter.|`|hmU2udmRaa	maybe, but it sucks so much, that when i listen to it, my ears bleed.  i think even god, if he does exist, would agree.|`|Fh6W9BRVaa	personally...i dont believe in god. im athiest. but dont stop reading because i dont.<br>  <br>  i think that if the is a god, then he wont mind the style of music you listen to, how it sounds, or even what the lyrics are. you could listen to lincoln park if you wanted and im pretty sure he wouldnt like damn you to hell or anything. that really would be dumb. if there is a god i dont think there really would be a "hell"<br>  i dont think there is anything that could possibly make the only "perfect" mans father get so angry at someone that he would send them to a place of torture for eternity.|`|nI1N3pxqaa	"There is no Christian music, only Christian lyrics" - Rick Warren<br>  <br>  Music itself is just kind of a vehicle for it's message - good or bad.

She's barely even mentioned.<br>  <br>  Catholics do NOT spend church time singing to Mary...sometimes we sing about Mary if it's a particular day of remembrance about her, like the day we remember that the angel told her she would be carrying the Christ Child, but the context is ALWAYS about Christ coming to earth. <br>  <br>  Come and see, Jenny. We won't try to convert you. You can sit in the back and take notes. Take notes about what the songs are about. Take notes about how much scripture we read. Take notes about what the priest says.

You may violate Protestantism but that isn't the same as violating Christianity.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	well apparently you've never been to a Catholic mass because Mary is mentioned only ONCE in the mass and it's in the Nicene Creed.  If the Gospel is about Mary well that's Scripture and i'm not going to tell you that may not happen.  If you want to ensure that the scriptures are not about Mary you can look them up prior to going to mass.  It's published so that in attending mass for 3 years you will have read the entire bible!  In the month of May there will often be a song to Mary during the mass in which we show our thankfulness to God for giving us Mary as such a wonderful example, gracious even Jesus listened to her even though it wasn't the Time.  However, even then we don't pray TO MARY BUT ONLY JESUS & GOD IN THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.  <br>  <br>  i don't know where you got the misconception about the Mass but it just goes to show - sometimes people don't share the truth with us and when we then speak of it AS a truth - we often learn a valuable lesson.  These next 40 days in particular before Easter are very much a solemn time reflecting on Christ in our lives.|`|3QWGdZlAaa	so go to a different church.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	First of all, we worship ONLY God and Jesus Christ. We do ask for intercessions by the Saints and Mary and the Angels, but we do not worship them.<br>  <br>  Let me see...A Catholic Mass has about 5 or 6 songs (at the most) sung. It takes up about 15 minutes of our Mass. One of those songs *might* be about Mary during a normal Mass. There are about 3 days out of the entire year that we give more attention to Mary than normally, but it is NEVER over God. <br>  <br>  That leaves 45 minutes left for the Mass:<br>  <br>  --We come in, we pray to God and for the forgiveness of our sins.<br>  --We listen to the readings (one Old Testament reading, one New Testament reading and a Gospel reading)<br>  --We sing Psalms (this is between the first and second reading and the second and Gospel reading)<br>  --A homily is given<br>  --We pray more, TO GOD.<br>  --We the go into the consecration<br>  --We kneel in prayer TO GOD.<br>  --We stand and recite the Lord's Prayer<br>  --We kneel in prayer once more<br>  --We receive the Eucharist<br>  --We pray some more<br>  --We say a closing prayer and close with another song about God's goodness and we leave.<br>  <br>  I've been Catholic for 11 years. The only time we "spend church time singing to Mary" is during Christmas and it's about Christ's birth and thus Mary is part of the song, the Assumption of Mary (usually only one or two songs) and the Immaculate Conception. <br>  <br>  That's it. <br>  <br>  We are Christians. A Christian is someone who follows Jesus Christ and believes He is Lord and Savior, which we do. <br>  <br>  You will not violate Christianity if you sing about Mary. You are confusing prayer and song with worship. To pray means "to ask" and nothing more. All worship is prayer, but not all prayer is worship. Singing songs is not worship either. <br>  <br>  If we're so horrible and obviously not Christian, then don't go to a Catholic Mass.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	First off we Catholics ARE Christians and have been for two thousand years, secondly there is NO obligation to pray to mary. We ask Mary and the saints to pray for us, we Pray Directly and Worship God alone. Yes you would be very welcome at the Church everyone is welcome Catholic stands for Universal.<br>  <br>  We do pray Direct to Jesus, why do you ask for prayers or say prayers for family and friends (interceding on their or your behalf)?. It's called INTERCESSION we ask Mary and Saints to pray for us just like you would ask a family or friend to pray for you. We pray DIRECTLY to God and Worship God alone not Saints or Mary!.<br>  <br>  And it is Bibilical here you have some referance,Thus, in Psalm 103 we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:20–21). And in the opening verses of Psalms 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!" <br>  <br>  Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In the book of Revelation, John sees that "the twenty-four elders [the leaders of the people of God in heaven] fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints" (Rev. 5:8). Thus the saints in heaven offer to God the prayers of the saints on earth. <br>  <br>  Angels do the same thing: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar [in heaven] with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3–4). <br>  <br>  Catholics and Orthodox Worship God and God alone<br>  <br>  Mary is not dead 'she is no longer in this World' but she is in Heaven. I will give you one easy example that is even in the KJV. When Elijah and Moses appeared to Jesus were they dead?, NO!. We do pray directly and Worship God but we ask the Saints and Mary for intercession ' For them to pray for us'.|`|AA11102015	Pray to God through Jesus.

Nothing about singing to Mary will violate your largely-false notions of Christianity, but you're free to do as you please.<br>  <br>  And you will find (if you can be bothered to listen to what you're being told, that is), that Catholics worship only God and Jesus. We don't worship Mary, but we do honor and respect her for the part she played in bringing our Savior into this world. <br>  <br>  And there is no say or think about our Christianity. We *are* Christians, whether people like you, CJ in whatever incarnation he's picked now, and other Catholic haters like it or not.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Please re-read your Bible. It does not say that Christ is our only Intercessor, or at least my Bibles don't, and I have many translations. What it does say is that Jesus is our only Mediator. . .and there is a HUGE difference between the two things.<br>  <br>  Christ is our only mediator or "lawyer," if you will, in the matter of salvation. That's because He is the One who paid our sin debt on the Cross, and He is the only One Who can tell the Father, "I've taken care of what this person owes, so they are no longer guilty." He mediates the dispute between God whose justice must be satisfied and us sinners who cannot pay our debt on our own, and He brings the entire matter to a satisfactory conclusion for both parties.<br>  <br>  An intercessor is one who prays for another person and asks God to help them. Think in terms of a family friend who knows the Boss and can put in a good word for someone who is applying for a job. Any believer can be an intercessor -- your mom, a friend at church, or even a total stranger. But there can be only one Mediator, and that is Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. <br>  <br>  Incidentally, if no one can say "Jesus Christ is Lord" except through the Holy Spirit (and I have repeatedly acknowledged on this Forum that Jesus is my Lord and Savior), wouldn't that make me -- le gasp -- a Christian?|`|OywIJxobaa	I find it weird when "real" and "loving" Christians go out of their way to offend other Christians.|`|xtEhw0lgaa	Apparently you are not a christian.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi Chele,<br>  It would probably take me a good couple of hours to write down the stuff that  have experienced both alone and when in the company of others. We live in what our adult son's call a 'weird' house. Often things go missing even when you have just put them down. Footsteps are heard moving around the bedrooms when everyone including the dogs are accounted for. Pictures have flown off the wall and by flown, I mean moved away from the wall about 3 feet before dropping and hitting the floor ( that one was witnessed by neighbors who had called in for coffee). We had a tumble dryer that had no motor in it and was awaiting repairs, one evening my husband heard a noise coming from the kitchen so got up to look but found nothing. He settled down again and we heard the noise again. This time we both got up to find out where the noise was coming from - the tumble dryer with no motor or electricity supply was tumbling away quite merrily! I have had shadow people wander through the kitchen and have woken up during the night to find a silhouette of someone standing near the doorway. The most recent is the visitation of a cat. We have never owned a cat (have dogs and parrots) but you will hear a cat meowing by your feet. Now if this was just in one room, then I would blame something in that room for making the sounds but it doesn't, it has been heard in the living room the hallway and in the kitchen by one of our sons and his dad both witnessing it together.<br>  Are you not bored yet ? Lol<br>  I have seen full blown apparitions and even held conversations with them thinking they were real people on to watch them dissipate like smoke. I have heard whispers when there is no one there, smelt perfumes that no one uses, smelt flowers in the middle of winter, had an overpowering smell of burning rubber/paper/plastic with no source to where it is coming from. We have experienced a phone ring that wasn't connected to any service provider. Had our faces and hair stroked on numerous occasions by unseen hands - that freaks friends when it happens to them :-)  There have been so, so many incidents that it would take forever to write them down here - but I assure you, these are all very true experiences. I do not drink or do drugs. I am suffering no form of mental illness or trauma. These things can occur day or night, either awake or when settling for/waking from sleep. If no one else had witnessed many of the events, then I would pacify myself with my imagination, even though I know that I would  only be lying to my self by doing this.<br>  I hope you do give EVP a try, don't be scared there really is nothing to be scared of. Good luck and if you think I can offer any further help please feel free to email me. Good luck|`|3uCRmoosaa	My house is haunted also but to tell you it all would take FOREVER. As far as Orbs go try not to let yourself get freaked out because nine times outta ten they are just dust. Ouija boards will attract unwanted visitors and if you don't "close" it right they will stay and considering you can't control who comes through it's probably a bad thing. Same thing with EVP's people get obsessed and start to believe the information they are getting. We have a spirit that like to lie and start fights with the people in the house. My advice is BE CARE FULL.|`|WcTZ7n8waa	Yes I do. When I was eight years old I saw a shadow figure right in front of me just standing there not moving. Then it just faded away.

You must remember that the times of the bible writting are different from now and men did write the testimates.  Besides the inspiration of God you also have the old laws of the society based in  the Israel of the past where women did submit to their husband, where disobediance did call for death, where there were sacrifices.<br>  The world has changed and so as our view of God and Religion.

Some of the laws were to reveal to the Israelites how to obey and please God (the Ten Commandments for example). Some of the laws were to show the Israelites how to worship God and atone for sin (the sacrificial system). Some of the laws were intended to make the Israelites distinct from other nations (the food and clothing rules). None of the Old Testament law is binding on us today. When Jesus died on the cross, He put an end to the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23-25; Ephesians 2:15).<br>  <br>  In place of the Old Testament law, we are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind … and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39). If we obey those two commands, we will be fulfilling all that Christ requires of us, “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:40). Now, this does not mean the Old Testament Law is irrelevant today. Many of the commands in the Old Testament Law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament Law can be a good “guidepost” for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor. At the same time, to say that the Old Testament Law applies to Christians today is incorrect. The Old Testament Law is a unit (James 2:10). Either all of it applies, or none of it applies. If Christ fulfilled some it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.<br>  <br>  “This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome” (1 John 5:3). The Ten Commandments were essentially a summary of the entire Old Testament Law. Nine of the Ten Commandments are clearly repeated in the New Testament (all except the command to observe the Sabbath day). Obviously, if we are loving God we will not be worshipping false gods or bowing down before idols. If we are loving our neighbors, we will not be murdering them, lying to them, committing adultery against them, or coveting what belongs to them. The purpose of the Old Testament Law is to point people to their need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24). The Old Testament Law was never intended by God to be the universal law for all people for all of time. We are to love God and love our neighbors. If we obey those two commands faithfully, we will be upholding all that God requires of us.|`|nkFHk9dNaa	The Bible is much bigger than four quotes of political incorrectness ; there is so much beautiful stuff in the Bible which will make you not care about this ; you can find bad anywhere if you look for it.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Ever read about the new covenant in the New Testament?|`|wP1pgUKVaa	These are OT laws...they do not apply to today because we are more "modern" geez all u anti-god people do is take a passage from the bible and use it to disprove it!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Try actually reading the New Testament...it explains that the old law is gone and we live under the new law, salvation through Jesus Christ.

Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the alien or the poor. In your hearts do not think evil of each other.'<br>  <br>  What's wrong with that passage from Ezekial?  God is saying that he allowed people to do what they wanted: following bad statutes and laws that they could not live by, allowing them to make human sacrifices out of their children, etc.  He allowed them to succomb to their evil human nature.  Isn't that what people want?  They don't want God telling them what to do, right?<br>  <br>  Ephesians...you skipped a VERY important passage: 5:25-33<br>  <br>  Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church—for we are members of his body. "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

I am in no way any bible scholar, but I do enjoy the Word of God.<br>  <br>  I like your post and because of it I felt led to read the portion that you cited.<br>  What I find so striking about our hearts is that its made to love the Lord.  From loving the Lord as our first and best love, we can be those who love others in a lasting way.<br>  <br>  When I think of " keeping our hearts from being hurt" it really gave me pause because if we are not those who keep and guard our hearts will all vigilance, things can become very complicated for us and ultimately, it frustrates what the Lord created our hearts for... <br>  " To Make His Home in all our hearts through faith"<br>  <br>  I have this example that is a cool picture of our hearts. Consider a green banana. While it is young, it is firm and nice to hold. But if this green banana is handled in the wrong way.. always squeezed and thrown down on the ground, then as it ripens, we may not see the visible signs of damage on it, but once it ripens fully and we seek to peel the skin off, it is then we notice all the spots on the inside. I've come across bananas like that before and its a reminder for me, " Guard your heart sandy.. guard it will all vigilance. "<br>  <br>  What guards our hearts is the Peace of the Lord. And while we are young, it is important to allow the Lord to guard what we allow into our hearts. What we give ourselves to love. We do not want the scars, they are easy to get but very heard to deal with. <br>  Daniel , a young handsome captive in the most poweful empire in the world, " set his heart not to defile himself."<br>  He had everything going for him in babylon.. Good looking, intelligent, yet, he set his heart not to allow babylon to get into his heart. They changed his name, they tried to make him eat all the food that would flavour him according to " Babylon" but he sought the Lord.. ate vegetables and drank pure water, paying the price to keep his heart pure and unto the Lord. This man grew to be someone that God could depend upon.  If God had His will in the heavens to be carried out..He knew that He can touch Daniel's heart to repond and pray for it to be done on the earth. Daniel prayed 3 times a day, was always in communion with God. Joseph was an example as well. He was in Egypt, but his heart was for God. No matter what hardships came his way, he took God as his refuge. <br>  Sis, it all begins with our hearts.<br>  We want it to be set on the Lord while we are young. While we are still green. So that as we age, our insides will be preserved for the Lord. People would look at that and scoff... but what is important is not what they think.. its what God sees when He looks in on our hearts.' Is it a good Home for Christ? or Is it polluted with all kinds of garbage? Pride? Sin? Is it a hard place?  Is it thorny and anxious?<br>  <br>  What goes in our hearts takes a while to be worked OUT of it.<br>  May we heed your speaking and " keep our hearts from being hurt"<br>  In the end, if we are not diligent to keep our hearts, we lose out bigtime.  The " clean up" work, where God has to do some deep cleaning is painful,but God is still able to work it out.... <br>  <br>  I really appreciate your sharing. Hope we can all give ourselves to Love the Lord with all our hearts.<br>  <br>  Grace be with you dear one.<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|512570c3244f4755781d38dac11996acaa	Bible Scholars say, "Its Changed"<br>  What Does the Real "Word of God" Say?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamcode.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamcode.com/</a><br>  <br>  Did Jesus Claim to be God?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/29/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Jesus in the Quran?<br>  Muhammad in the Bible?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/24/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Bible Compared to Quran<br>  <a href="http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/Bible_vs_Quran.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/Bi...</a><br>  <br>  Quran or Bible: What's The Difference?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/51/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Why Do Muslims Reject "Perfect Salvation Thru Jesus?"<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/27/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Did Isaiah 42 (Bible) Describe Muhammad?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/382/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a>|`|rxScdXM4aa	it means guard yourself from what is impure and unholy.|`|f5IcUlXTaa	I just read Proverbs 4:20-27 and it does not say anything like what you wrote.  Is that the NWT?|`|0aN1xIxfaa	It cannot be possible to go through life without heart-ache (if not heart-break). But the person who looks steadfastly to God, and walks God's pathway through life, will find it true that "God heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds" (Ps 147:3 ) and, "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever." (Ps 73:26) Faith in God will protect our hearts.<br>  <br>  This passage is rendered in "The Message" as, "Listen well to my words; tune your ears to my voice. Keep my message in plain view at all times. Concentrate! Learn it by heart! Those who discover these words live, really live; body and soul, they're bursting with health. Keep vigilant watch over your heart; that's where life starts. Don't talk out of both sides of your mouth; avoid careless banter, white lies, and gossip. Keep your eyes straight ahead; ignore all sideshow distractions. Watch your step, and the road will stretch out smooth before you. Look neither right nor left; leave evil in the dust."|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	You have to go to the original language for this one.  The word "heart" is leb, which basically means inner being or the essence of a person's moral character.  It's not specifically about love, just being of sound morals.<br>  <br>  BTW what translation are you using?  Not familiar with that wording and looks a bit off even in English.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	I've looked at several widely used English versions, and I can't see anything in any of them even vaguely similar to your bit about keeping our hearts from 'getting hurt'.<br>  <br>  I would be interested to know which version you're quoting.<br>  <br>  In standard English versions there's really nothing very puzzling about these verses.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Stephen R. Covey, Spiritual Roots of Human Relations, p.48<br>  To improve your relationships, don't look to others to change and don't look to easy, step-by-step shortcuts or sunshine formulas that do not strike at the roots. Look to yourself. Be honest with yourself first-the roots of your problems are spiritual. So also, therefore, are the root solutions. The key lies in your own heart: "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." (Proverbs 4:23.)    <br>  <br>  Aquinas, Thomas, Summa Theologica, part 2, section 2<br>  On the contrary, It is written (Prov. 4:25): "Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thine eye-lids go before thy steps." Now this pertains to prudence, while the contrary pertains to thoughtlessness. Therefore thoughtlessness is a special sin contained under imprudence. <br>  <br>  Elaine L. Jack, “Ponder the Path of Thy Feet”, Ensign (CR), November 1993, p.98<br>  In Proverbs we read the admonition, “Ponder the path of thy feet” (Prov. 4:26). We have busy feet in this church. We do much. We have all heard the counsel to “be anxiously engaged” and then the qualifier “in a good cause”<br>  <br>  20 ?

lNlL0Ag2aa	Because it's funny seeing the other answerers' reactions. I admit some of their questions are really humorous and creative. You can't really stop it so why not just have a good sense of humor and accept it? But I do agree with you on blatantly vulgar ones.

kVR8w8ynaa	Neither is acceptable, but in this case, as in many others, it's the race flag that truly brings things to a halt.  We, as a society, are trying so hard to outwardly display our no-tolerance policy for racism of any kind in any way that even a hint of something racist will send us all flying off our rockers, whereas bullying, unfair aggression, and simple disrespect are still often overlooked.|`|9KBqN0KAaa	She wasn't racially bullied anyways.<br>  <br>  she went on about being called 'shilpa poppadom' but when she left the house she was shouting 'chicken curry rules' - so that just makes her completely hypocrital.<br>  <br>  but in answer to your question, neither is okay really.<br>  but the general public like to see people getting bullied, however if the victim of the bullying is disabled, or of a different race (in england especially) the media love to feed of it and turn it into a big thing.

wTB9xTvDaa	alot.<br>  They are risking a lot, flaunting their stuff.<br>  Plus, if they have a pee accident, everyone will know.|`|xnsU60hhaa	You really need to put more details in your question. Is it for a private party that you are hosting? If so, you should tip 20%. So if her charge is $200 per hour, you should tip her $40. Your guests are of course not expected to tip, that is your job as the host.<br>  If it is at a strip club, then tipping a buck or two per dance is fine, but if you get a $50 lap dance, then you should tip her $10. <br>  Keep in mind that most of a strippers wages are from tips. And they can make very good money. If you are cheap, you aren't going to get the best of service.<br>  Have fun!|`|UxlL89rHaa	Depends on the looks, attitude, and whether or not she got you exited.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	The tip should be in proportion to the amount of skin exposed and her proximity to you.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Depends on what you're getting.<br>  <br>  Give her a hand full of change and you'll get slapped... but it'd be funny!|`|uIg6an6Jaa	how good was she ?????|`|xRUZkFU9aa	From what I have seen, $1 per dance is she did a dance on the stage and is coming around to collect tips. If you really like her, it could be $5 I suppose. Think about it. There are about 60-100+ guys in the strip club and she dances 2 songs for about 5 minutes at most. Then she goes around to all of those guys and at least gets $1 from each of them. That's $60-100 per 5 minute song, and that doesn't count all the lapdances and bigger tips...she probably dances at least 4 stage dances per night..so off of that alone she is making $240-400 absolute MINIMUM. <br>  <br>  For a lapdance I don't believe you necessarily need to tip.<br>  PS. If you spend 3 hours at the strip club and there are about 10-15 girls dancing per hour...you are essentially spending $10-15/per hour BASE just to watch them dance. That's $30-45 for the short time that you are there, plus the $10 entrance fee so like $40-55 MINIMUM just to watch someone you can't even touch? I'm a girl, but I'm just being honest and looking at it from a dudes perspective...so I wouldn't tip more or else you will  be broke :(.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer my Q if you can please.

Once you meet Christ in your heart, you know he's real and you no longer need the tangible. That's what faith is all about- the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<br>  <br>  If you don't know him...........get to know him..........<br>  <br>  Every knee will bow and every toungue will confess that Jesus is Lord.

But he is so beautiful, that I just want to be kissing and hugging him forever. My teenagers one is a dancer and she keeps my life strong, and my son is a boxer always worried about looking good and working with his grandpa in the weekends. My husband is just there, waiting for me to get a job. I have been in interviews for the past four years and gotten no where. I am seeking to pursue a Master's Degree in special education, but I feel that I am just wasting my time. I recieved all the aid you can think of to work only 5 days a month. And you know what, I feel so worked out. So unmotivated. I don't want to keep looking for that job anymore. I wish I could just quit going to grad school. But then what am I going to do at home? Just live from the government. I also feel that my fire has died. I even feel that people don't like me, that it's too hard to make friends. That my professors don't like me, I feel like an alien. Sorry I couldn't get you motivated. But at least I said what I wanted to say. I hope that you at least have someone to cuddle up with, a brother, sister, mother, son, daughter, pet, or husband or wife. Good luck and keep looking for something to motivate you. I just went to church. I asked God for motivation and I ended up here at the library answering answers.

You've done everything I would recommend, but I think it sounds like this boy needs some medical help. Constant halitosis is a sign that something is wrong with his health. Either he needs more water or is missing a nutrient somewhere. Remove all junk food from your house and bring him lots of glasses of water. <br>  <br>  After you have been together for a while, you might ask him if he's been to the doctor recently. When he answers "why?" you might say  "Well, I noticed your breath is pretty strong and I am concerned, often that is a sign of some kind of illness and I am worried about you."<br>  <br>  This only really works on REALLY close friends and lovers, so don't try to use that on like, coworkers or something.

APAwebK1aa	1 - Brazilians could be called latinos only if our country wouldn't multi cultural and our idiom was derived only of latin.Portuguese is derived not only of latin but greek, and nobody call us a greek people.<br>  <br>  2 - When you goes to the United States the dept. of immigration fills a sheet with your data. One of these data is ethnicity. They have some options:<br>  <br>  (a) White;<br>  (b) Native american;<br>  (c) Afro American;<br>  (d) Asiatic:<br>  (e) Latino.<br>  <br>  So, or you are latino, or you are white. Both, you can't be at same time. Then, for the authorities of immigration in the USA, latin is somebody who can't be white. Latino is a race and a color for them.<br>  <br>  In resume: we are not latinos, because we don't have latin culture and we are not latinos because many of us are whites and others, afro descendants and, for than in the United States, or you are white, or you are afro or you are latino.<br>  <br>  But, if somebody has some doubt, see my favorit videos to evidence how many whites are in Brazil.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=AllAboutBrazil&view=favorites" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=AllA...</a>|`|AA12365543	brazil has the 2nd largest White population in the Americas, 49% of brazil is European-Brazilian. <br>  <br>  I don't know where people got the idea that Brazil is just Black people, they really need to travel down there.<br>  <br>  Oh and no we are not all Latinos. Latino means someone from Spain, Portugal, Andorra, France, Italy, San Marino, Vatican City, Romania and Maldova. None of my family came from any of those countries.  You Americans have a weird idea of what Latino is|`|QepcG34Vaa	First of all, latino is any person who speaks any language derived from latin, and a latin american is any person who was born in latin america. Being white is a skin color not a race, and there are more whites in latin america than there are black people. People from latin america are mixed from spain, indigenous (some countries african american). Therefore any person who was born in Brazil is a latino, and they could be white, or mestizo, or black. Italians influenced  brazil and argentina also. So the nationality is Brazilian, but you are a a latino.|`|DvZdB66maa	Maybe for the same reason that people don't know that there are Black people in Brazil either... Brazil has the second largest population of Black people after Nigeria -- even more than the United States.<br>  <br>  Americans tend to get their ideas from the media. Americans don't know a lot about other cultures or what's going on around the world; they barely know what's going on in their own backyards. Most other countries, on the other hand, are very knowledgeable about the world around them.<br>  <br>  So yeah, like I said, Americans get most of their knowledge from what they are told and what they see on television.

Yes, the other may be Protestant (my son has a Catholic Godmather and a Protestant Godfather).<br>  <br>  2. They will Baptize them a few weeks after birth I believe (you shouldn't really be bringing the baby to Church before then anyway--germs!). The Godparents must be Confirmed (which is usually around 15). I think it is important to choose someone well-versed in their Faith, and someone with a good understanding of what it means to be a Godparent. For that reason, I prefer to see adults as Godparents.<br>  <br>  3. A child may only have 2 Godparents, one male, and one female.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Catholics are Christians.

A strange old lady has moved into my house.  I have no idea who she is, where she came from, or how she got in.  I certainly didn't invite her.  All I know is that one day she wasn't there, and the next day she was. <br>   <br>  She's very clever.  She manages to keep out of sight for the most part, but whenever I pass a mirror, I catch a glimpse of her there.  And when I look into a mirror directly to check my appearance, suddenly she's hogging the whole thing, completely obliterating my gorgeous face and body. <br>   <br>  It's very disconcerting.  I've tried screaming at her to leave but she just screams back, grimacing horribly.  She's really rather frightening.  If she's going to hang around, the least she could do is offer to pay rent.  But no luck.<br>   <br>  Every once in a while I do find a couple of dollar bills on the kitchen counter, or some loose change on my bureau or on the floor, but that certainly isn't enough!  In fact, though I don't like to jump to conclusions, I think she steals money from me regularly.  I go to the ATM and withdraw a hundred dollars, and a few days later, it's gone!  I certainly don't go through it that fast!  So I can only conclude that the old lady pilfers it.  You'd think she'd spend some of it on wrinkle cream.  Lord knows, she needs it! <br>   <br>  And the money isn't the only thing she's taking.  Food seems to disappear at an alarming rate, especially the good stuff ... ice cream, cookies, candy.  I just can't keep them in the house.  She really has a sweet tooth.  She should watch it too, as she's really putting on the pounds.  I think she realizes that, and to make herself feel better, I know she is tampering with my scale so I'll think that I'm gaining weight, too.<br>   <br>  For an old lady, she's really quite childish.  She also gets into my closets when I'm not home and alters all my clothes.  They're getting tighter every day. <br>   <br>  Another thing I wish she'd stop messing with, is my files and the papers on my desk.  I can't find a thing any more.  This is particularly hard to deal with because I'm extremely neat and organized.  But somehow, she manages to jumble everything up so nothing is where it's supposed to be. <br>   <br>  Furthermore, when I program my VCR to tape something important, she fiddles with it after I leave the room so it records the wrong channel or shuts off completely. <br>   <br>  She finds innumerable, imaginative ways to irritate me.  She gets to my newspapers, magazines and mail before me and blurs all the print.  Then she's done something sinister with the volume controls on my TV, radio, and phone.  Now all I hear are mumbles and whispers. <br>   <br>  She's also made my stairs steeper, my vacuum cleaner heavier, all my knobs and faucets hard to turn, and my bed higher so it's a real challenge to climb into and out of.<br>   <br>  Furthermore, she gets to my groceries as soon as I shelve them and applies super glue to the tops of every jar and bottle so they're just about impossible to open.  Is this any way to repay my hospitality? <br>   <br>  I don't even get any respite at night.  More than once her snoring has awakened me.  I don't know why she can't do something about that.  It's very unattractive. <br>   <br>  And as if all this isn't bad enough, she is no longer confining her malevolence to the house.  She's now found a way to sneak into my car with me and follow me wherever I go.  I see her reflection in store windows as I pass, and she'|`|4Q9dHbmCaa	“The secret to staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age.” - Lucille Ball<br>  <br>  “It takes a long time to grow young.” - Pablo Picasso<br>  <br>  “For my birthday I got a humidifier and a de-humidifier...

Which is not unlike African American. However if someone has come to the UK directly from Africa and not via the Caribbean, then they are called African.<br>  <br>  I would point out one thing though. Back in the 1960's the African Americans had this massive campaign as part of the civil rights movement. They wanted to be called BLACK. They coined the term, Black Power, and had the slogan, "I'm black and I'm proud." <br>  <br>  Then suddenly at some point, they decided that they did not want to be called black anymore and were no longer proud about being black. Only they never told the rest of us. So we still live in confusion.<br>  <br>  By the way, I am what they would call Black in the USA, and we call Mixed Race in the UK.

African-American is a term used for black Americans,<br>  who are also the descendants of African slaves.<br>  <br>  Hence, the term African-American.|`|CWMaHHMFaa	No the offensive names for African Americans begin with the letter N and I'm sure you catch what I'm saying.

Once the "N" word was removed from their vocabulary, the word "black" also seemed to carry a negative connotation.  For me, if you ain't from Africa, you're not African.  I'm a white guy from the US, they don't call me a European American.  I am a white American.  (Example:  WHITE Man Can't Jump).  Ask Whoopi Goldberg if she is "African American", she will say "No, I am a Black American, and proud of it".  If someone calls you out for using "black" instead of African American, call them an ignorant American.
UhyvM73iaa	I have never read that Zakat giving to non-Muslim is not allowed. It is preferable to give Zakat to your fellow Muslims to improve their life.<br>  If one doesn't find a poor Muslim worthy of accepting Zakat, then <br>  off course you can give money to Islamic school, or for any project that will benefit people in general. Like insalling a cold water fountain in the main street so people can have drink of cold water in hot summer.<br>  <br>  If you have non-Muslim neighbor, you can give Zakat to him if there is no poor Muslim around you.  Some one gave a goat to Prophet as a gift for his family. He had it slaughtered and gave all  meat for his wives. At that time he also instructed his wife Aesha to send a portion of goat meat to his Jewish neighbor|`|MirV9kSsaa	yes<br>  <br>  ''Zakaat'' is for poor and needy muslims ONLY,but you can give ''sadaqa/charity'' to anyone,muslim or non muslim.<br>  <br>  u also may check<br>  <a href="http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=E&Id=87316&Option=FatwaId" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowF...</a>|`|vKzGpEXZaa	No, it counts if the people you're giving to are "friends" of Muslims.

He still has to pay full Zakah from his wealth annually according to the nisab<br>  <br>  "The majority of scholars are of the view that non-Muslims should not be given of the money of Zakah except those whose hearts are inclined to Islam, though there is a difference over whether such stipulation is still relevant or not and the permissibility of giving them of the Zakah money is hunted with controversy. <br>  <br>  The prohibition of giving them of the Zakah money is based on the hadith of Mu`adh Ibn Jabal when he was sent by the Prophet to Yemen: "It (Zakah) is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them," i.e. the rich among Muslims and the poor among them. (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) <br>  <br>  From islamonline. check the link I gave u as there are arguements to whether u can or cannot give zakah to non muslims :)

bb4c06cc3a8b453e7f0afd62e1307b04aa	i think it's to do with the pronunciation<br>  for example the name Francis only gains an apostrophe:<br>  Francis' pencil<br>  this is because if an s was added too, the sound would be:<br>  "france is is"<br>  the repetition of the "is" (or "iz" depending on your accent) is not wanted<br>  but with the name Jess it would be Jess's pencil because the sound is<br>  "Jess is" does that make sense?<br>  with Texas it makes a similar sound (again, depending on your accent it might be closer than elsewhere) but Jones's would not make a repeated sound...<br>  <br>  EDIT: I looked on the links in the answer below and found this:<br>  "The rule of grammar states that if a name has more than one syllable and ends in an s, and the last syllable makes an /ez/ sound (like in Texas), then only an apostrophe is needed."<br>  <br>  that explains it!|`|x1LmS9vTaa	I checked into that for my own interest since I've seen both.<br>  <br>  According to some sources, either is acceptable as long as you're consistent.<br>  <br>  According to others, if the apostrophe is after a plural noun, it's -s'-; if it's a singular proper name that ends in -s- (such as Texas :-)), it's -s's-.

They are two different things. <br>  <br>  How do you explain me? My father says he is a homosexual now, yet at some point he had sex with my mother, a female.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	It's not impossible, but scientifically, there is simply no evidence/proof of a gay gene yet|`|k03dYskYaa	Hermaphrodites and homosexuals are two entirely different things.<br>  A hermaphrodite is an unfortunate person whose sex is ambiguous by birth; a transsexual, on the other hand, is one who, for “psychiatric” reasons, decides to undergo surgery and be physically changed from one sex to another. Regarding the latter, the comments of Albert Rosenfeld, science editor of Saturday Review/World, are appropriate: “I have been surprised to hear so little debate or discussion about the ethics of surgical sex change for purely psychiatric reasons .?.?. The transsexual phenomenon points up our propensity for underrating people’s willingness to accept circumstances they would once have considered outlandish—and for underestimating the speed at which this process occurs.”<br>  <br>  The increase of transsexualism is but one more facet of the spread of practices “contrary to nature” characterizing much of this present period. (Compare Romans 1:26.) The remedy for those with such inclinations is not surgery but a change in outlook, ‘being made new in the force actuating their minds’ with the aid of God’s Word.—Eph. 4:22-24.<br>  <br>  Nowadays it is popular to say that homosexuals are born that way and that sexual orientation is unchangeable. Time magazine, for example, dramatically announced: “A new study suggests that there is a structural difference between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men.” However, this study was made on the brains of men who had died of AIDS. Surely this does not prove the point!<br>  <br>  Another theory involves hormones. Scientists observed that laboratory rats deprived of male hormones displayed “female” mating behaviors. They concluded that homosexuals may similarly be the victims of a biological mishap—an exposure to too many or too few male hormones before birth. Many scientists believe, though, that the odd behavior among rats is little more than a reflex—not really ‘homosexuality.’ Besides, humans are not rats. The Harvard Medical School Mental Health Letter argues: “It is extremely unlikely that prenatal hormones influence .?.?. human sexuality in the same direct way they organize reflexes involved in the mating behavior of rats.”<br>  <br>  Much attention has also been given to genetic studies. Among homosexual males and females who have identical twins, about half of their twins are likewise homosexual. Since monozygotic [identical] twins are genetic duplicates, it seemed logical to conclude that some mysterious gene caused the deviation. However, note that half the twin siblings were not homosexual. If this trait were really genetically programmed, would not all the twins have it? True, genes and hormones may play some role. Even so, Scientific American reported the findings of some that the evidence “strongly suggests that environment contributes significantly to sexual orientation.”<br>  <br>  I have to do more research on a true hermaphrodite and how they would live their life. But it has nothing to do with gay marriage, because it is entirely a different issue.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	they have no justification.<br>  <br>  They have "It's an abomination" from an unsubstantiated source<br>  <br>  They have "It's unnatural" which has been proven to be false<br>  <br>  They have "It's disgusting" which is opinion based<br>  <br>  They have "love the sinner hate the sin" which is just a way for them to feel ok about what their own bigotry<br>  <br>  Now they say that homosexuals should remain celibate, which is especially ridiculous since most homosexuals don't share their delusions, and since celibacy has been proven to lead to disastrous results in catholic priests|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	1.

So, from that standpoint, homosexuals are NOT genetically "born" that way.<br>  <br>  ????????HOWEVER!!!  Science *has* proven that all fetuses actually start out chemically female and that there are cases where a chemical imbalance, in utero, which is present at the moment where male fetal brain development is beginning to lock-in the genetic sexual preference, that this chemical imbalance can cause this genetic sexual preference lock to never actually lock into place.<br>  <br>  ????????HOWEVER!!!  Science has also shown that the number of times this has actually happened is statistically way too low to justify the number of homosexuals on the planet -- and doesn't explain lesbians at all.  Thus, SCIENCE still holds with the theory that homosexuality is *primarily* a social factor and not a biological one (excepting situations of actual hormonal imbalances).<br>  <br>  ????????Knowing my God, I also know that they are correct in this matter.  The problem is that just because there have been a few proven cases of failures in utero, too many desperate parents of homosexuals and too many homosexuals, themselves, will excuse away their responsibility to God.<br>  <br>  ????????As for the rest of your questions...

I don't believe that Christians have been clear about what they do and don't believe about homosexuality.  Homosexuals say that they were born gay therefore it's okay.  Christians say, noooooooooooooooo!  Now, IF a huge argument wouldn't breakout, they could get a few things straight (no pun intended).  I clear it up for everyone!<br>  <br>  The Bible is CLEAR that we ALL are born "fallen," which is one way of saying "sinful," "in bondage to sin," etc.  So, YES, homosexuals are born sinful.  Homosexuality is a specific example of sinful behavior.  Most Christians would admit that a homosexual no more goes down a laundry list of potential sins and says I choose to be gay than they choose which sins they are weak in.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing.  I was born with a certain predisposition toward gluttony.  I've been fat most of my life.  I've battled my overeating (gluttony) most of my life.  What if I said simply: "I was born this way.  Gluttony is an alternative lifestyle"?  Let me give you a couple of hints:<br>  <br>  1. I would still die from obesity-related illnesses and diseases and<br>  2. My gluttony would still be sinful<br>  <br>  See?  SAYING that you didn't choose it doesn't absolve you of the responsibility to own up to your part in it.  Just as I shove that entire pizza in my face, the gay mans shove the entire ... well, we won't go there.  <br>  <br>  We're all born sinners, but that doesn't make our sinfulness okay!  The homosexual unlike the liar, the murderer, the cheat, the adulterer, the pedophile, and any other sinner on the planet suggest that because this sin comes so doggone naturally to him that it's okay.  It's NOT okay!  It's not open to debate!  God says it's wrong!  They will be judged for their sins!  Only Jesus can save them from these sins!  The rules are no different for gays than any other sinners.  We were all born sinners, but we are still responsible for our sinning!<br>  <br>  And by the way ... being born a hermaphrodite is NOT a sin!  That's a birth defect.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|RF1jX2ZVaa	This statement was made to the Israelites shortly before they entered the promised land. God was reminding them about their priorities in life as to worship of him. Which would be first for them? It was up to each individual to answer that question.<br>   So to today the principle is today for true Christians. Who do we put first in our lives? If we put God first and "seek first his kingdom" he will provide for us on a daily basis. Matthew 6:33 May God Bless.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Nobody is under the law.

It is a group of Chrsitians that warp, misrepresent and lie about Judaism to try and fool uneducated Jews into converting<br>  <br>  As for the section of Talmud you quote- it comes to talk about the low level of the KOHANIM (priests at the time) it talks about the degeneration fo the Kohanim after the time of Shimon Hatzadik since they come to be dominated by heretical sadduccees and thus the miracles associated with the Kohanim in previous years no longer occurred and certain portents were given to the Jews to try and get them to repent before the Temple would be destroyed.   This is all in relation to the death of SHIMON HATZADIK who had been the Kohen Gadol<br>  <br>  Of course, the people at yashanet.com misrepresent this by taking it out of context and then twisting to try to represent it as something it is completely unrelated to.|`|DTog0VZWaa	My first question is - what's your source for the quote?  There are a lot of fakes floating around!!!<br>  <br>  A quote without all the other commentary on the page, plus the pages before & after CAN NOT be interpreted correctly.  Talmud is complex that way.  So if you found this without the rest of the page which has comments in all four corners, then this is a fake & not worth looking at.<br>  <br>  So if you can point to the source & include all the contextual commentary, we can start to study & understand what the words are referencing.  I'll star & hopefully one of the Jewish folks with access to the 72 volume Talmud, can answer more specifically.<br>  <br>  Here's a bit on how Talmudic Midrash works:<br>  <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Midrash/MidrashAggadah/FillingGaps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Mi...</a><br>  <br>  ----<br>  As for referencing Jesus because of a single vague phrase - nope. <br>  <br>  What is interesting, is that there is a camp of theory that the Jesus storyline is a amalgam of Talmudic stories (actually religious oral histories at that point).  That in fact, there was no Jesus, but an invention of one based on elements vaguely alluded to that would sound familar to people...but then using ancient culture gentile stories as well to add elements totally foreign to Judaism.  If true (& there is recent archeological evidence to support it), then it can easily be the other way around...that the Jesus story is told by borrowing this or other terms from Jewish oral histories recorded in Talmud.<br>  <a href="http://mama.indstate.edu/users/nizrael/jesusrefutation.html" rel="nofollow">http://mama.indstate.edu/users/nizrael/j...</a><br>  (If you skip by the countermissionary comments & look for the Talmudic references, it's in there.)<br>  <br>  <br>  ==============================<br>  ==============================<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  PROOF THAT YOU HAVE A FALSE QUOTE & INTERPRETATION.<br>  Thanks for the link.  You are taking this from a CHRISTIAN site.   The link goes to this home page with this on it:<br>  <br>  "It has only been in recent years that the Messianic "Jewish" (i.e. Christian) movement in general and the Torah Observant/Nazarene ... movements more specifically have sought to get back to what it was really like in the first century.

Then find the rest of the commentaries on the same page, & commentaries written about the commentaries.<br>  <br>  THEN & ONLY THEN can we even being to look at what the passage really means with any certainity.<br>  <br>  This is where Messanic Christianity is a problem:<br>  1. They pretend they are presenting Jewish information.  That's violation of Judaism that we now have to constantly defend against.  THEY AREN'TJEWISH IN ANY WAY & this is deceit.  (Their theology is deeply violating of Judaism, so it's can't be an extension of Judaism.)<br>  2. They are at it with unwillingness to let Jews be Jews.  Can you say deep seating anti-Jewish biogtry that's killed millions of us.  I can & I'm tired of it.<br>  <br>  This entire attempt on their site is disingenuous.  If they wanted to genuinely look for theology in Talmud, they'd use real Talmud & real commentary to understand the language...not massage it for the uninformed to swallow whole (& eventually assault Jews with.)<br>  <br>  Talk about hate.  It's not the Jews.  We are incredibly patient with these types of hateful assaults.

KszocgnSaa	Don't. You can get easily addicted. You may do stupid things. The good feelings don't last long. It doesn't solve anything. It does stay on your hair which could be bad in the future. It kills brain cells. Etc.<br>  <br>  I won't lie tho, it is rather fun...:( Ugh just don't do it!<br>  <br>  Don't give in to pressure.

Just trying it won't get you hooked, or dumb. After a couple of weeks it won't be in your system. The first time you might not feel anything. But if you do the feeling is hard to explain, and people feel different things. Some are paranoid, some are comfortable, some get hungry, some get giggly, some get boring and tired. It also depends on the kind of weed you smoke.<br>  <br>  Reasons you should: why not?<br>  <br>  Edit: F what people are saying, the consequences are nothing! if you get caught by the cops you get a ticket you have to pay, that's it. Most good jobs don't drug test. And it has helped me focus on more things than ever before. My attitude towards things are much better. Don't listen to people that have never tried it.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	You're overthinking it dude.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	Experimenting once isn't a big deal, mate.<br>  <br>  But if all your friends are doing it, then it's a big deal, because it's all they'll want to do.<br>  <br>  It messes with your interests some times, it can make you boring and temporarily sort of stupid-- especially when you're high at school. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it. A friend of mine got in to a whole lot of drugs that way. She became a very funny person, but her grades tanked and she had a lot of other problems. She got really pretty and really cool and nice for a little while, but then I think it led her to do other things, and she all of a sudden became an emotional wreck and a totally mean person. <br>  <br>  Like seriously, I was at a birthday party with her, and we were all cool, but then I bit a tomato and a seed fell on her arm. She then proceeded to hit me in the head until I could not see and then insulted me for not defending myself, and everyone else except for one person was asleep, and the awake person didn't say anything because she's weak. I didn't want to fight her because she's my friend. This was the worst moment in my entire life so far, because hey, I love the girl, and it seemed like she hates my guys.<br>  <br>  And I can't even talk to her about how much she upset me (she did a lot more things than this, but whenever I think of this moment I sort of die a little bit), because her drug use made her forget the past several years of her life. Her memory is shot. I hate not being able to talk about it. <br>  <br>  During that period in her life she only cared about herself no matter how many chances were given to her. Granted, right now she's totally clean (except for low-intensity cigarettes, which sort of bugs me), and she's cool again because she doesn't really remember much, I guess. She also gets pretty good grades and has matured a lot.<br>  <br>  That stuff is OK in moderation. Most pot use is harmless if done at the right time, I guess, and I can't say my friend's actions were directly caused by pot and not some way worse things. In fact, she was waaay an extreme.<br>  <br>  If you're going to do it, give it a whirl now and then, but don't try other things that are way worse. Don't be stupid about it. You can either go the route of having fun like most people, or end up desperate for a new high and flunking high school. The only reason pot isn't legal is because you can't really tax it-- it's sort of innocuous. It would certainly be more productive to live through your own problems, though, without the pot.|`|ER0yiuyhaa	Hell No!!! it doesnt matter how depressing your life is- actually, the more depressed you are, the higher risk of becoming addicted. it's not worth an addiction and possible death from it- life may suck now, but it can always improve. addiction sucks. stay away from drugs and you'll do a lot better. it can always make you change- you tend to do higher risk things when drugged up. if your friend cant handle you as you are, then they arent your friend. side effect i know of- you get sick. like, hurling and wobbling from a bad trip and it can last for days, when the trip itself lasts for, like, an hour or something. it's not worth it. also, death can happen your first time. you tend to get the smell on you. you get a reputation that wont likely do you well in life. just isnt worth it.|`|TPZZESeeaa	i always say try everything once, BUT there are some things i never tried and never will. crack and meth being two of them. weed was no big deal for me...i mean heck, it grows out of the ground, it's a weed. it just so happens when you set it on fire there are some side effects, hungry happy and sleepy.|`|7umNEMLeaa	No. Especially not when you are depressed.

The rest of the world can either take me or leave me - it's none of their business.<br>  When - and if - you decide to say anything, will be up to you to decide. You don't have to, but choose a time that suits you - if you can. If someone is determined to out you, be honest with yourself and then you can be honest with everyone else.

Eo7KcX3Waa	We are made up of soul, flesh and spirit...<br>  The spirit is the part that connects with God , once we surrender our life to Him...<br>  The flesh is the part that wants to do the wrong thing, to sin...<br>  The soul is the part that holds memories, emotions and personalities, it is who we are...|`|tx4bRDrXaa	11 In the Hebrew Scriptures, the English word “soul” comes from the Hebrew word ne′phesh, which appears over 750 times. Its equivalent in the Greek Scriptures is psy?khe′, which appears over 100 times. The New World Translation of the?Holy?Scriptures consistently renders these words as “soul.” Other Bibles may use a variety of words. Some of the ways the King James Version translates ne′phesh are: appetite, beast, body, breath, creature, dead (body), desire, heart, life, man, mind, person, self, soul, thing. And it translates psy?khe′ as: heart, life, mind, soul.After Adam was told that he would die if he disobeyed God, an opposite view was expressed to Adam’s wife, Eve. She was told: “You positively will not die.” Here the seeds of the immortal-soul doctrine were sown. And ever since then, one culture after another has adopted the pagan view that ‘you will not really die but will continue to live on.’ The Greek pneu′ma (spirit) comes from pne′o, meaning “breathe or blow,” and the Hebrew ru′ach (spirit) is believed to come from a root having the same meaning. Ru′ach and pneu′ma, then, basically mean “breath” but have extended meanings beyond that basic sense. (Compare Hab 2:19; Re 13:15.) They can also mean wind; the vital force in living creatures; one’s spirit; spirit persons, including God and his angelic creatures; and God’s active force, or holy spirit. (Compare Koehler and Baumgartner’s Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, Leiden, 1958, pp. 877-879; Brown, Driver, and Briggs’ Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, 1980, pp. 924-926; Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, edited by G.?Friedrich, translated by G.?Bromiley, 1971, Vol. VI, pp. 332-451.) All these meanings have something in common: They all refer to that which is invisible to human sight and which gives evidence of force in motion. Such invisible force is capable of producing visible effects.<br>  <br>  Another Hebrew word, nesha?mah′ (Ge 2:7), also means “breath,” but it is more limited in range of meaning than ru′ach. The Greek pno?e′ seems to have a similar limited sense (Ac 17:25) and was used by the Septuagint translators to render nesha?mah′.While nesha?mah′ (breath) and ru′ach (spirit; active force; life-force) are sometimes used in a parallel sense, they are not identical. True, the “spirit,” or ru′ach, is at times spoken of as though it were the respiration (nesha?mah′) itself, but this seems to be simply because breathing is the prime visible evidence of the life-force in one’s body.—Job 9:18; 19:17; 27:3.Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils “the breath [form of nesha?mah′] of life,” it is evident that, in addition to filling the man’s lungs with air, God caused the life-force, or spirit (ru′ach), to vitalize all the cells in Adam’s body.—Ge 2:7; compare Ps 104:30; Ac 17:25.<br>  <br>  This life-force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception. Since Jehovah was the original Source of this life-force for man, and the Author of the procreation process, one’s life can properly be attributed to Him, though received not directly but indirectly through one’s parents.—Compare Job 10:9-12; Ps 139:13-16; Ec 11:5.<br>  <br>  Life-force, or spirit, is impersonal. As noted, the Scriptures refer to the ru′ach, or life-force, as being not only in humans but also in animals. (Ge 6:17; 7:15,?22) Ecclesiastes 3:18-22 shows that man dies in the same manner as the beasts, for “they all have but one spirit [weru′ach], so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast,” that is, as to the life-force common to both. This being so, it is clear that the “spirit,” or life-force (ru′ach), as used in this sense is impersonal. Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils “the breath [form of nesha?mah′] of life,” it is evident that, in addition to filling the man’s lungs with air, God caused the life-force, or spirit (ru′ach), to vitalize all the cells in Adam’s body.—Ge 2:7; compare Ps 104:30; Ac 17:25.<br>  <br>  This life-force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception.

tJBvGea5aa	A]<br>  Considering the part of raping and such:<br>  Not all scholars do agree that Aisha was married at the age of 9, some say she was 19. <br>  <br>  But 1400 years ago, Arabic women used to get mature very soon. now, a nine year old is just a child, but back then, nine years old is a perfect time for a woman to get married because they were very very mature. and, i would like to point out to the fact that the nature of the environment is a big factor in the maturity process for women, like in countries that have a tropical weather women get mature sooner than those in countries in the global area.<br>  <br>  Aisha WAS ENGAGED BEFORE to another person before she got married to Prophet Muhammed. so it was a very common thing to get married at this age. And Aisha is a very mature woman as she memorized lots and lots of Hadiths of the Prophet and is a great source to a lot of the Prophet's sayings.<br>  <br>  Also, the Pagans back then were looking for anything in order to use it against The Prophet. But History tells us that this issue was never the object of attention to all of the disbelievers which proves that it was normal and that a 9-year-old was not a child back then.<br>  <br>  Also, check this out:<br>  <br>  In the 19th century, the minimum age for marriage for female women in most states of America was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The British law of year 1911, stated that the permissible age for women to get married was 12 years old<br>  <br>  <br>  B]<br>  Considering the part where you say we want to kill everyone, that is just a big myth and a totally huge misconception about Islamic teachings. Just because some so-called Muslims do some terroristic acts, that does not mean that The Quran and Muhammed (PBUH)orders us to do so. those people are not following their Religion's rules and regulations.<br>  <br>  <br>  Muhammed was a Peaceful Peaceful man.<br>  here are some historical evidence:<br>  <br>  As an example in the Battle of Uhud, when the Prophet (PBUH) got his face wounded, his tooth broken, his helmet smashed on his head and got hit with stones untill he fell injured into one the holes that was dug as traps for Muslims. The Prophet (PBUH) had two iron rings from his helmet pierced into his cheek. After all that, when the Muslims helped him rise from the hole, the Prophet (PBUH) held his hands towards God and, with his body bleeding profusely, prayed for the forgiveness of the enemy, saying: O God, forgive my people, for they do not know.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Prophet said:<br>  <br>  "Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone."<br>  <br>  <br>  And the Quran says:<br>  <br>  "But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things). (The Noble Quran, 8:61)"<br>  <br>  "If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds. (The Noble Quran, 5:28)"<br>  <br>  "God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes. God loves just dealers. (The Noble Quran, 60:8)"<br>  <br>  "Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy handhold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. (The Noble Quran, 2:256)"<br>  <br>  "Say, 'The truth is from your Lord': Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it):......(The Noble Quran, 18:29)"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mahatma Ghandi in an interview with a Young Indian Newspaper said:<br>  <br>  "I wanted to know the characteristics of the man who possesses the hearts of millions of people, without any doubt. I became fully convinced that sword was not the mean by which Islam gained its positions and grounds.<br>  <br>  <br>  The weird thing is that a lot of non-Muslims learn about Islam from non-Muslims who are anti-Islamics. I mean if someone wishes to know about Islam, then he should ask Imams and knowledgable Muslims and seek information from them. I thank you for being neutral on this, and trying to seek information fairly.

He was someone many people trusted. Though he could not read or write he could speak brilliant arabic. He was very patient - he lost both his parents and his grandfather when he still young. His first marriage - prior to Islam, was to Khadijah (Peace be upon her), who was a 40 year old widow. - All of his marriages (Except to Ayesha peace be upon her, which i will mention later)  were to women who were either widows or divorced. - At this time these women were looked down upon by society (think western culture 100 years ago). <br>  <br>  The whole idea of rape. Now Ayesha (Peace be upon her), as i mentioned above was the only virgin he had ever married.  But honestly, if she was abused do you honestly think she would have done the amazing things she herself did in her lifetime? I know people who have been abused, it is a terrible thing, and most people who are abused get away from there abuser as soon as they can, and many suffer from mental distress after. Is there any evidence this happened to Ayesha (Peace be upon her)? You know she has done so much for Islam. Many hadiths were narrated by her, many people use to go to her to seek islamic advice - especially when it came to issue's of marriage and family. Why would she grow up so dedicated to this religion, if the main person has abused her? <br>  <br>  You know they are many sayings from the companions of the Prophets who talk about how honest the Prophet was - even prior to Islam. How can a person dramatically change just like that? It doesn't happen. <br>  <br>  And now the murdered part. Could you give me any evidence on what instant your talking about? I mean yes people died in the major battles, as people would at any time, but the conquest of Makkah, it was probably the only time in the history with so few people dying. <br>  <br>  Anyways i suggest you buy a bibliography of the Prophet Muhammads life and create your own opinion of the topic. Seriously, learn about it before listening to other peoples opinions. The typical view of Islam is not good at the moment, learn about islam and form your own opinion. Also don't look at all muslims behavious - culture and islam often get mixed up.

This is what is said about Mohammad ASWS by NON-Muslims, if you don't want the Muslims' opinion, which of course I understand why lol:<br>  <br>  "lf a man like Muhammed were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness."<br>  George Bernard Shaw<br>  <br>  ''They (Mohammad’s critics) see fire instead of light, ugliness instead of good. They distort and present every good quality as a great vice. It reflects their own depravity… the critics are blind. They cannot see that the only ‘sword’ Mohammad wielded was the sword of mercy, compassion, friendship and forgiveness – the sword that conquers enemies and purifies their hearts. His sword was sharper than the sword of steel.''<br>  Mahatma Gandhi.<br>  <br>  "I have studied him — the wonderful man — and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ he must be called the saviour of humanity."<br>  George Bernard Shaw in "The Genuine Islam"<br>  <br>  "By a fortune absolutely unique in history , Mohammed is a threefold founder of a nation, of an empire, and of a religion."<br>  Rev.

To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves. Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad." <br>  W. Montgomery Watt, MOHAMMAD AT MECCA, Oxford, 1953, p. 52. <br>  <br>  There are many more from islamawareness.net.<br>  And for your questions to Muslims: Mohammad ASWS never harmed a single innocent soul, not even animals and plants. He only fought in self defense when he had no choice but to do so after seeing the Arab Pagans kill off the Muslims on a daily basis, and even then the rules of war commanded that they only fight those who fought them, and not to hurt women, children, elders, men who were working, and not to cut down trees. There are many disgusting lies out there about him, but it doesn't matter, those liars should ask theirselves in the first place why over a billion people would want to believe such a man if he was so violent and preached hate.. never, just the opposite.. he was the best man to have ever lived...<br>  <br>  anyway salam alaikom :)|`|WL7nKDplaa	It depends on your beliefs. If you are a Christian then you probably think he was bad. If you're Muslim you probably think he was good. We could go through and do this with every religious figure.

While they may be more accustomed to sleeping with men, I doubt they are accustomed to rape and/or being automatically put into the role of 'tension reliever' for everyone. <br>  <br>  Additional to physical sexual considerations, there are a lot of people in jail that either hate or fear homosexuals, or simply view them as being lesser beings/people, particularly as being lesser men. That last point cannot be stressed enough, since jail is an all-male setting where survival is based on masculinity, toughness, and hierarchies.|`|vYeS5mYnaa	i think any kind of rape is still rape no matter your orientation.<br>  <br>  i wonder if a frontal lobotomy would be less frightening for you.

If I were you, I'd be much more worried about your "partner" than about some guy down the road who has paid his 'debt to society' and is no doubt being watched like a hawk (not least by those police outside his place). You don't even know what he's convicted for: do you have any reason to believe he's actually guilty of crimes against kids? <br>  <br>  But if you think that breaking some guy's windows and trashing his home is likely to make him rehabilitate and settle into society safely, then you're even more of an idiot than this question would lead me to believe.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Vigilante action is never justified.

It stared at me for a moment then ran right across the sidewalk in front of me. I walked on, laughing to myself and watching the cat. <br>  <br>  In my distraction, I was hit by a stunningly silent mini pocket rocket. The sudden impact at my knees caused me to practically roll over the thing and fall on my book bag. Tore right through me. It must have looked amazing but it hurt like hell - hurt my pride more than anything. <br>  <br>  The kid that hit me, a timid freshman at my high school, apologized profusely and asked if I was okay. I decided to be a brat and said that I had sprained my ankle. He freaked out for a second. I made an agonized face and said I wasn't sure if I could make it home. He offered me his cell phone only to realize that he had forgotten it at his house. He helped me stand up then asked if I could use a ride. I looked at the little bike, then at him and burst out laughing. Somehow, I knew that wouldn't work out. <br>  <br>  I thanked him and went on my way. I only had a bruise and a few scratches on my arm. All good... stupid cat.<br>  <br>  (I have a few other stories in mind right now, but I don't want to make this too long.)

If you really love eachother, are committed to having a relationship and capable of communicating and keeping open with eachother regarding thoughts and feelings on monogamy etc, then it can work out well.

If you believe the Bible then how can you not believe Jesus Christ when he said that He is the only way to the Father.

You can't say you believe the Bible but then deny what Jesus Christ clearly told us. Christian believe the Torah and of course the Gospel and the entire Bible, but not the Quran.

He tell us that one day we will be in paradise with Him and also states that there is no marriage in heaven.

I think you need to study up on other religions.<br>  <br>  1. Look up the word "associate." Muhammad is definitely associated with God by many Muslims. <br>  <br>  2. The Ba'hai, some unitarians, many spiritualists, even a few Christians (myself included), and a host of smaller sects all believe in the Holy Books you mention.<br>  <br>  3. I have known some Muslims in my time that did NOT love Jesus. And many people do not believe that Muhammad was really a prophet. Doesn't mean they are right, but the truth is this: what you are suggesting is very subjective. <br>  <br>  4. Define "contradictions." There are many, many different translations of the Quran into different languages. Whenever you translate a book, there are bound to be different interpretations and errors. Most people do not read Arabic, so many Muslims in the world are reading books with likely contradictions. Second, many atheists and skeptics would suggest that many activities and miracles in the Quran do contradict themselves and the laws of nature. Third, being that the only true way to read the Quran is in Arabic, this suggests that it was meant to be a local, regional religion that is completely influenced by Arabic culture that further suggests that it is not a universal religion. <br>  5. Christianity demands that people pray CONSTANTLY. That is MORE than 5 times a day. And it demands charity as well, as does many religions. <br>  <br>  This is not to bad-mouth Islam at all. As I said, I am a Christian who considers Islam equally valid to my own beliefs. But to suggest it is somehow more pure or valid than other religions based on your loose and inaccurate views of the religions of the world is just a subjective fallacy. That fact is the answer to your question: a lot of people deny Islam because they don't believe a word of what you say here.|`|tGgADx4Raa	You say you believe in the Bible, well what about the part where Jesus says "for I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father exept thru me" <br>  <br>  I'm sorry but your main prophet Muhammed was sent by satan to distract people from the real true faith that is tought by the Bible. You aren't going to heaven cuz you are not born again and covered in the blood.|`|s5kxcnW4aa	I am happy you admit Islam is not accepted by God.  But why you think it will be accepted in the future is beyond me. <br>  <br>  By the way, Islam must be a real loser if it believes in all those phoney religious books that you name.|`|wHs88ZdFaa	Well, after reading all the answers I think nobody has ever tried to understand anything about Islam. And I'm not sure I agree with your opinion either, and um... you are doing it wrong.<br>  <br>  1. this is wrong, Baha'i's also believe in one god, so does Zoroastarism and many other religions including Judaism.<br>  <br>  2. obviously this is wrong, Islam is not the only religion. Then how do you define the list of books your perfect religion must believe in?<br>  <br>  3. same as number 2.<br>  <br>  4. Qur'an is never modified by any human throughout the history. If you are a true muslim you should beleive in this.<br>  <br>  5. This not a reason, for some people this is actually a drawback.<br>  <br>  If you believe in god (Allah) for the reasons you have listed here, I think you will have great problems in the future.|`|hZco463faa	Since god doesnt really exist does it matter?

rv2Iy1Y7aa	It still amazes me that so many students of the Latin language translate "Age" as "live".  Though it is not entirely incorrect, "Vive" is a much more specific and every bit as accurate (if not more so) as is "age".  <br>  <br>  "Ago Vestri Vita" is not even close to "Live Your Life" in Latin.  "Age Vitam Tuam" is not incorrect.  My choice for "Live Your Life" would be "Vive Vitam Tuam." for the reasons stated above.  I would even use the capitalized letters because this appears to be for a slogan, motto, or (some would say "God forbid!") a tattoo.<br>  <br>  Note: I am assuming you want this in the singular.

It seems to me that you have a problem with religous fanatics, not regular christians.<br>  <br>  And what really bothers me are athiests who like to compare God to creatures like Santa, unicorns, and the tooth fairy. Because when you talk like that, it doesn't look to me like your really an athiest, it makes it look like your just mad at God. True athiests just don't care about God, they don't waste their time with the belief of one, and they don't let it eat at them when they're lying in bed at night. To put all the energy into bashing God and her followers shows that you must of believed in her at some point in your life, and now your making up for that by posting questions that are along the lines of "Look how above the belief of God I am!

7f902849206b6ad53be9c20e17a43943aa	El siguiente texto lo saqué de ayuda por parte del 911 (emergencias de Estados Unidos).-<br>  <br>  El cuidado del adulto intoxicado (ebrio):<br>  No hay medicamentos que ayuden a acelerar el proceso de quitar la embriaguez (i.e, beber café no ayuda) <br>  <br>  Tomar un regaderazo de agua fría puede temporalmente hacer que una persona esté más alerta, pero no acelera el proceso para quitar la embriaguez. <br>  <br>  Mantenga el alcohol fuera del alcance del paciente (e.g., retire al paciente del bar /fiesta, quite cualquier alcohol que esté a la mano) <br>  <br>  Vigile y proteja al paciente de algún da?o (e.g., evite actividades peligrosas, manejar) <br>  <br>  Acueste al paciente de lado (en caso que vomite) <br>  Llame al 911si tiene dificultad para despertarse, dificultad para respirar o presenta un comportamiento violento. <br>  <br>  ***Ya que se sienta mejor la persona se hace lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  Detoxificación:<br>  <br>  Es urgente ayudar al cuerpo a recuperarse de la intoxicación por alcohol. Esto se logra tomando un detoxificante antes de ingerir bebidas alcohólicas (para que lo afecte menos), antes de dormir (para lograr que actúe en esas valiosas horas de sue?o) y al levantarse (recuerde que el cuerpo está eliminando a una velocidad menor por la intoxicación.<br>  <br>  Deshidratación: <br>  <br>  Los síntomas? Boca seca, sensación de sed insaciable, angustia por un refresco, agua o lo que sea. Por favor no se tome un tanque de agua sin parar, por que el exceso de agua trae como consecuencia un empeoramiento del dolor de cabeza.<br>  <br>  Mala alimentación:<br>  <br>  Es importante ingerir alimentos que aporten calorías, ya que el cuerpo ha gastado bastante energía y seguramente hay un fuerte desbalance. Que consuma alimentos naturales evitando alimentos procesados.<br>  <br>  Reposo:<br>  <br>  Descanso adecuado. Cantidad de sue?o adecuado. Son dos claves importantes para permitir una buena recuperación. Por ello cuando se trata de ir “obligado” a una reunión entre semana, es clave tomar un detoxificante desde antes de ingerir bebidas alcohólicas, ya que seguramente la falta de sue?o al día siguiente será empeorada por la presencia de alcohol. Menos alcohol y el cuerpo se recupera más rápido.<br>  <br>  Dolor de cabeza :<br>  <br>  Hay varias alternativas para tratar este tipo de dolor de cabeza. Por un lado los analgésicos que contienen cafeína, ya que a la vez que potencian el medicamento, actúan como un estimulante del sistema nervioso central. Por otro lado los síntomas son más parecidos a la migra?a que al dolor de cabeza tensional o postural. Sin embargo las alternativas más comunes como el efervescente que contiene ácido acetil salicílico puede afectar negativamente el estómago y empeorar el cuadro de cansancio (por el ácido láctico de los músculos). Tampoco es recomendable el uso de acetaminofén ya que requiere trabajo del hígado que de por sí ya está bastante ocupado.

(DG)//<br>  <br>  Um médico que n?o está em dia com os "métodos para realizar opera??es sem a necessidade da transfus?o sangüínea" para dar aos pacientes "acesso aos avan?os científicos e a inven??es que garantem a seguran?a dos pacientes" certamente negligencia a sua profiss?o e na verdade p?e a vida do paciente já debilitado em risco de óbito prematuro.<br>  <br>  \\Hoje, cerca de 90 mil profissionais de todo o mundo fazem opera??es sem que o paciente receba uma única gota de sangue doado. Em 1990, o Canadá tornou-se o primeiro país a desenvolver técnicas para a prática. No Brasil, a novidade chegou em 1992, quando um grupo de Jundiaí passou a atender pacientes Testemunhas de Jeová. Fanatismo religioso ou n?o, o fato é que a solu??o encontrada para atender esses fiéis tornou-se op??o de outras pessoas que temem contrair doen?as em doa??es de sangue. ‘‘Em muitos hospitais, a procura por esse tratamento é maior por parte de pessoas n?o religiosas’’, diz o cirurgi?o-geral paulista José Henrique Silveira. Ele argumenta que a seguran?a do sangue de hoje é muito pequena — em fun??o do número de doen?as potencialmente transmissíveis, como hepatite, sífilis e Aids. ‘‘No futuro, isso vai se tornar um prática médica extremamente comum’’, prevê Silveira.//<br>  <a href="http://www2.correioweb.com.br/cw/2001-06..." rel="nofollow">http://www2.correioweb.com.br/cw/2001-06...</a> <br>  <br>  N?o deixe de ver a matéria completa neste link e procuremos nos inteirar melhor sobre o assunto visto que, assim como n?o se pode facilmente saber se uma pessoa morreu porque n?o recebeu uma transfus?o sanguínea por falta de aplica??o de alternativas como as que o link acima apresenta ou morreu realmente devido à dita transfus?o como o que ocorreu recentemente em que uma crian?a infectada por bactéria desconhecida morreu devido à rea??o a uma transfus?o de sangue. . . <a href="http://cd.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geuny77.J...">http://cd.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geuny77.J...</a> <br>  <br>  Neste caso de quem é a culpa? Haja vista que muitas outras crian?as também morreram devido à mesma infec??o encontrado nos exames de sangue. Será que diriam que todas elas morreram também devido á uma transfus?o? Que outros fatores teriam causado a morte delas? Ficamos nós a conjecturar, enquanto outras crian?as morrem porque n?o se deu alternativa mais segura do que o sangue cujo o governo insiste em manter como padr?o apesar dos altos impostos arrecadados (só em CPMF) desviando-os para fins escusos. E o povo vai atrás da onda em massa de propaganda pró sangue que o próprio governo dá incentivos (claro, o sangue doado é de gra?a) em vez de aplicar os recursos nas técnicas já consagradas e usadas como alternativas em muitos centros médicos Brasil afora.<br>  <br>  Mas bíblicamente, onde diz no contexto de Atos 15:28,29 e 21:25 que tal proibi??o se restringe só ao comer? <br>  <br>  Praticamente todas as tradu??es da Bíblia traduzem a palavra para "abster" que na lingua portuguesa é sin?nimo de privar-se de algo, refrear-se, n?o fazer voluntariamente (Aurélio XXI). Ora, se é uma tradu??o para a língua portuguesa a palavra deve ser entendida como tal. Ent?o, no que tange ao sangue, Atos 15:29; 21:25 significa "privar-se de sangue" n?o se limita a n?o comer, mas privar-se de introduzir, por qualquer meio, o sangue em nosso interior. Da mesma forma que diz que devemos nos abster de fornica??o (imoralidade sexual, sexo fora do casamento etc, Cor 6:9; Col 3:5; 1Pe 4:3) . . . ou seria privar-se de comer como muitos interpretam? Mas n?o. . .  querem tornar a adora??o a Deus mais "suave" ("esquecendo" que Deus proveu a ressurrei??o para os que amam os Seus mandamentos Jo 3:16; 6:39,40,44; 12:50). <br>  <br>  Malabarismos apologéticos, exegéticos e teológicos para mensurar e declinar ordens expressas por meio do espírito santo posto por escrito como Palavra de Deus é um pecado grave que talvez n?o seja perdoado pelo Criador. Abster-se de sangue é uma prova de fé segundo a carga que cada crist?o carrega (Gál 6:5) mas principalmente, é um ato de verdadeiro amor a Deus.<br>  <br>  "Porque este é o amor de Deus: que guardemos os seus mandamentos; e os seus mandamentos n?o s?o pesados. Porque todo o que é nascido de Deus vence o mundo; e esta é a vitória que vence o mundo, a nossa fé."   I Jo?o 5:3,4  <br>  <br>  Tudo de bom<br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>!!!<<<<<<<<<<<br>  <br>  Compreendo sua posi??o meu caro. . .<br>  <br>  Mas veja, na Bíblia o nosso Criador também diz para n?o matar o ser humano e que devemos amar até nosso inimigos. . . Mas será que posso matar com uma transfus?o de veneno letal só porque a Bíblia n?o menciona sobre o assunto? Negativo, n?o é? A Bíblia contém princípios claros sobre o que agrada e desagrada a Deus, n?o cumprí-la implica em desfavor e morte eterna para com Ele.<br>  <br>  Que disse Jesus? "Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que, se o gr?o de trigo, caindo na terra, n?o morrer, fica ele só; mas se morrer, dá muito fruto. Quem ama a sua vida perdê-la-á, e quem neste mundo odeia a sua vida, guardá-la-á para a vida eterna. Se alguém me serve, siga-me, e onde eu estiver, ali estará também o meu servo. E, se alguém me servir, meu Pai o honrará."  Jo?o 12:24-26<br>  <br>  Que exemplo deixou o apóstolo Paulo? "Mas em nada tenho a minha vida por preciosa, contanto que cumpra com alegria a minha carreira, e o ministério que recebi do Senhor Jesus, para dar testemunho do evangelho da gra?a de Deus." Atos 20:24<br>  <br>  Para Deus n?o existe meio crist?o. . . Ou é crist?o num todo, ou n?o é. Assim como "Quem é fiel no mínimo, também é fiel no muito; quem é injusto no mínimo, também é injusto no muito." Lc 16:10<br>  <br>  Aliás, você tem no??o de quantos morrem vítimas de transfus?o sanguinea nos países cuja saúde tem pouco investimento ou é mal fiscalizada? N?o percebe que é o sistema que está errado?<br>  E, ao contrário, quantas Testemunhas de Jeová que se negaram aceitar uma transfus?o morreram? Esteja certo que, comparativamente morreram bem menos do que as que transigiram. <br>  Já vi antigos comentários seus que você tem verdadeira avers?o às TJ′s e se fecha para com qualquer argumenta??o que se dê em favor delas. Ent?o siga o caminho que escolheu e n?o invente quest?es que sutilmente tem a inten??o de desabonar as Testemunhas de Jeová. No mínimo, seja coerênte com o cristianismo que você prega. . .<br>  .|`|Ryr6cy8Baa	Eu faria a transfus?o. é triste ver que pessoas deixam morrer simplesmente porque alguem disse que transfus?o é errado.

CG9fYentaa	Se llama Libros Deuterocanónicos a siete libros del Antiguo Testamento que fueron a?adidos en la Biblia griega (Canon de Alejandría) por un grupo de maestros judíos (Biblia de los Setenta).

La lista (o canon) de libros bíblicos hebreos inspirados quedó establecida definitivamente en el siglo II, por el consenso de un grupo de sabios rabinos que habían conseguido escapar del asedio de Jerusalén en el a?o 70 y que habían fundado una escuela en Yamnia. Estos libros se denominan protocanónicos y son los siguientes:<br>  <br>  La ley. <br>  Los profetas. <br>  Los escritos. <br>  Este canon significó el rechazo de algunos libros, denominados deuterocanónicos, que un grupo de maestros judíos había incluido en el Canon de Alejandría o Biblia de los Setenta en el siglo II adC.|`|hbPDbbCwaa	Anda a Seminario Catolico, esos son amantes de los libros deuterocanonicos.|`|0JFytehnaa	ESPERO QUE NO TE SEA MUY PESADO Y LARGO LA RESPUESTA, Y SOBRE TODO QUE TE SIRVA DE ALGO.<br>  Libros protocanónicos y deuterocanónicos. – <br>  Los libros protocanónicos<br>  Ya se insinuó que existen un Antiguo Testamento menor, o incompleto, y uno mayor, o completo. Ambos nos fueron transmitidos por los judíos. El primero, por los judíos palestinos; el segundo, por los alejandrinos o helenistas.<br>  <br>  La actual Biblia judía está compuesta por tres divisiones, cuyos títulos combinados forman el nombre completo de las escrituras del judaísmo: Hat-Torah, Nebiim, wa-Kethubim, o sea la Ley, los  Profetas y los Escritos. Esta es una tríada muy antigua; se cree que fue establecida hace mucho en la Mishnah, o código judío de leyes sagradas no escritas y que fue escrita finalmente alrededor del a?o 200 d.C. Un agrupamiento semejante es mencionado en las palabras del mismo Cristo en el Nuevo Testamento, en Lc. 24,44: “Todas las cosas que fueron dichas respecto de mí deben ser cumplidas, las que se encuentran escritas en la Ley de Moisés, en los Profetas y en los Salmos”. Si vamos al prólogo del Eclesiástico, que fue fijado en éste cerca del a?o 132 a.C., encontramos que se mencionan “la Ley, los Profetas y otros que los han sucedido”. La Torah, o ley, consiste de los cinco libros mosaicos: Génesis, éxodo, Levítico, Números y Deuteronomio. Los Profetas fueron subdivididos por los judíos en Profetas Anteriores (i.e. los libros profético-históricos: Josué, Jueces, Samuel, [Reyes I y II], y Reyes [Reyes III y IV], y Profetas Posteriores (Isaías, Jeremías, Ezequiel y los doce profetas menores, a los que los hebreos cuentan como un solo libro). Los Escritos, mejor conocidos por un título prestado de los Padres Griegos, Hagiographa (escritos sagrados), abarcan todos los libros restantes de la Biblia hebrea. Nombrados en el orden en el que aparecen en el texto hebreo actual, son: Salmos, Proverbios, Job, Cantar de los Cantares, Rut, Lamentaciones, Eclesiastés, Ester, Daniel, Esdras, Nehemías, o Esdras II, Paralipomenon.<br>  <br>  La distinción de los Libros Sagrados en protocanónicos y deuterocanónicos trae a la mente el recuerdo de controversias que surgieron en la antigüedad a propósito de la canonicidad de ciertos libros de la Biblia. Pero con ella no se intenta establecer una distinción del valor canónico y normativo, ni desde el punto de vista de la dignidad, entre los proto y deuterocanónicos. Bajo este aspecto, todos los Libros Sagrados contenidos en la Biblia tienen el mismo valor y dignidad, pues todos tienen igualmente a Dios por autor. La distinción es legítima sólo desde el punto de vista histórico, del tiempo, en cuanto que los libros deuterocanónicos fueron recibidos en el canon de las Sagradas Escrituras sólo más tarde a causa de ciertas dudas surgidas a propósito de su origen divino.<br>  <br>          Los escritores eclesiásticos griegos suelen designar los libros protocanónicos con el término “homologoúmenoi”, o sea libros “universalmente aceptados”, y los deuterocanónicos con las palabras “antilegómenoi”, es decir, libros “discutidos”, o también con “amfiballómenoi”, a saber, libros “dudosos”[17]. Sin embargo, en el siglo XVI fue Sixto de Siena (+ 1596) el primero que empleó los términos protocanónicos para designar los libros que ya desde un principio fueron recibidos en el canon, pues todos los consideraban como canónicos, y deuterocanónicos, para significar aquellos libros que, si bien gozaban de la misma dignidad y autoridad, sólo en tiempo posterior fueron recibidos en el canon de las Sagradas Escrituras, porque su origen divino fue puesto en tela de juicio por muchos[18].<br>  <br>   Los libros deuterocanónicos son siete en el Antiguo Testamento y siete también en el Nuevo Testamento: <br>  En el Antiguo Testamento: Tobías, Judit, Sabiduría, Eclesiástico, Baruc, 1 y 2 Macabeos. Y los siete últimos capítulos de Ester: 10,4-16,24, según la Vulgata; así como los capítulos de Daniel 3,24-90; 13; 14.<br>  <br>           En el Nuevo Testamento: Epístola a los Hebreos, epíst. de Santiago, epíst. 2 de San Pedro, epíst. 2-3 de San Juan, epíst. de San Judas y Apocalipsis. También es bastante frecuente considerar como deuterocanónicos los fragmentos siguientes de los Evangelios: Mc 16,9-20; Lc 22,43-44; Jn 7,53-8,11. Sin embargo, las dudas acerca de estos textos han surgido tan sólo en nuestros días entre los críticos, por el hecho de que dichos pasajes faltan en algunos códices y versiones antiguas.|`|8uumrA3Uaa	Hasta donde yo sé, los protocanónicos son aquellos libros que fueron y son considerados como inspirados, tanto por los judíos, como por los católicos y los hermanos separados. Es decir, aquellos libros de la Biblia de los que nunca se dudó que fuesen inspirados. Estos reunen 17 Proféticos: (Isaías, Jeremías, Ezequiel, Daniel, Nahum, Habacuc, Joel, Amós, Malaquías, Zacarías, Ageo, Sofonías, Abdías, Oseas, Jonás. Miqueas y Lamentaciones) y 5 Sapienciales:  Job, los Salmos, los Proverbios, Eclesiastés y el Cantar de los Cantares)<br>  <br>  Los deuterocanónicos son aquellos libros de la Biblia de cuya inspiración se dudó algún tiempo o por parte de alguna iglesia en particular. Estos libros son especialmente siete del AT: Tobías, Judith, Baruc, Sabiduría, Eclesiástico (o Sirácida) y 1 y 2 Macabeos. Aún hoy en las Biblias que editan los hermanos separados, faltan estos siete libros deuterocanónicos del AT porque no los consideran inspirados. <br>  <br>  El resto de los libros del Antiguo Testamento son el Pentateuco (los 5 primeros: Génesis, Exodo, Levítico, Números y Deuteronomio)  y 12 Históricos. <br>  <br>  Saludos, te recomiendo sacar un tiempo para leer la Biblia, es la gran guía y consejera de todo ser humano y asesorarte con tu Iglesia.  Pero sobre todo, a practicar el amor que en ella resume.|`|ed9455073ec31d93432fe32c986e0c99aa	no se

Create a simple test where you place some objects in a room, then have them astrally project into that room and name all the objects. They won't be able to do it. No person that's written a book on it can either. If they could, they would take Randi's million dollar challenge. <br>  <br>  About all anyone will tell you is some form of self hypnosis, which will make you think you're out of your body.<br>  <br>  A lot of methods talk about trying to astrally project right before you go to bed.

In UK-style, only punctuation which belongs with the quote is enclosed in the quotation marks; in the US, periods and commas are inside, regardless of whether they belong with the quote, but other punctuation goes outside.<br>  <br>  Was it Hamlet who said, "Is this a dagger I see before me?"

AA10543905	you can be a christian and yet believe in evolution. as a matter of fact, the catholic Church is teaching that very well today. We believe that God works thorugh evolution. Now, you could talk of natural selection or random mutation; both are in the hands of God. There is an orderliness, or a purposefulness that results into whatever comes to be. God is the one who puts the order that results to random mutation or natural selection. what we as Christians should avoid is the scientific mistake of "material causality" Evolution has to involve final Causality, not material causality. If you need to talk more on this, contact me and we will talk more. Hope it helps|`|KP1pf7F9aa	Of  course!  Despite what some people mistakenly believe, evolution does not deny the existence of a creator and it makes no attempt to do so.  For all we know, God did create life and the universe, and evolution is just the particular way that he chose to do it.|`|Z4SR7pxpaa	i dont think so. that is an abomination to God.

It is even accepted as religious dogma in many denominations.|`|4798eafe385a2dd3a58c247394a4ab81aa	Yes you can, I am catholic and I believe in evolution, It's simply the most logic and common sense way to look at it, as for Creationism by an invisible God, well I have always had trouble with that one, I am a believer, but I am also becoming a free thinker regarding religion, I look to spirituality rather than religion it really makes much more sense, peace be with you.|`|7c4bb7da4f07da63eb46db5edf0e73a7aa	The Bible does say you should look for the truth right?|`|AA11743216	Sure... why not....

A Baptist Minister came upon the crash and felt that he had to pray for the "dead guy", a very strange thing for a Baptist!  So he got in the crushed car (the body was still crushed in the car) and started to pray and then sang the hymn "What a friend we have in Jesus" and when he got to the part that says "because we do not take everything to God in prayer" Don started to sing along.  Apparently the minister had some problems convincing the ambulance and police that "the dead guy is singing".

Trust is something that once lost, is very difficult to regain, as is one's sense of self-respect.

My principles would keep me from betraying my partner's trust, and from being complicit in another person's betrayal of their partner's trust. Do I think it's a sin? No. Do I think it's almost always a huge betrayal that hurts most if not everyone involved in a profoundly painful and life-altering way? Absolutely.

That is adultury.<br>  <br>  1Co 6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, <br>  1Co 6:10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <br>  1Co 6:11  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. <br>  <br>  All sin is not equal.<br>  <br>  There will be degrees of punishment in hell. Some sins are called abominations.<br>  <br>  1. Christ tells Pilate that the Jewish leaders have committed a worse sin than him, saying “he who has handed me over to you has committed the greater sin” (Jn. 19:11).<br>  <br>  2. Certain sins in the law are distinguished in a particular context as an abomination to God, implying that others are not as severe (e.g. Lev. 18:22; Deut. 7:25, Deut. 23:18, Isa. 41:24).<br>  <br>  3. Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is set apart as a more severe sin than blasphemy of the Son (Matt. 12:31)<br>  <br>  4. Proverbs 6:16-19 lists particular sins in such a way as to single them out because of their depraved nature, separating them from others.<br>  <br>  5. There are degrees of punishment in Hell depending on the severity of the offense (Lk. 12:47-48).<br>  <br>  6. Christ often evaluates the sin of the Pharisees as greater than the sins of others. “You strain out a gnat while you swallow a camel” (Matt. 23:24). If all sins are equal, Christ’s rebuke does not make any sense. (See also Lk. 20:46-47)<br>  <br>  7. Related to the last, Christ also talked about the “weighter things of the law” (Matt. 23:23). If all sins are equal, there is no law (or violation of that law) that is “weightier than others.” They are all the same weight.<br>  <br>  8. Unforgiveness is continually referred to as a particularly heinous sin (Matt. 6:14-15; 18:23-35).|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Indeed it is !

I have personally been in your shoes, and had to deal with similiar problems in an alternative way.  Through the noisy neighbour themselves.<br>    You may confront the person, respectfully, but firm,  in that they are disturbing you. Most likely- a person who would be so offensive continuously  is not going to respond in a way in which you  would like them to. <br>   This is the point where you decide to swallow your noisy neighbour's behaviour, or to halt it. Halting it usually means breaking the law to some extent- which I am not recommending. <br>   How about this?- Get his/her name- and license plate number, and use your free and available resources to find a Bigger reason why this person may not continue to abide there- lawfully. <br>   You see- those of us who respect the law- we tend to abide by it.<br>  Those of us who have criminal records- ignore it- just as your neighbour is doing now.  Call the cops- not property management.<br>  And have your homework ready.

LJlaHLQdaa	Hebrew Bible(or Tanakh) manuscripts<br>   <br>  A page from the Aleppo Codex, Deuteronomy.The Aleppo Codex (c. 920 CE) and Leningrad Codex (c. 1008 CE) are the oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts of the Tanakh. The 1947 find at Qumran of the Dead Sea scrolls pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices (see Tanakh at Qumran). Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the Old Testament were in Greek in manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the Book of Esther; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two scrolls of the Book of Isaiah, one complete (1QIsa), and one around 75% complete (1QIsb). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.<br>  <br>  Ancient Jewish scribes developed many practices to protect copies of their scriptures from error. The result produced by their methods is impressive. Significant variations among texts arise at an average rate of just under one consonant in every 1,500.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>   Extant Tanakh manuscripts<br>   <br>  Manuscript Examples Language Date <br>  Dead Sea Scrolls Tanakh at Qumran Hebrew, Paleo Hebrew and Greek(Septuagint) c. 150 BCE - 70 CE <br>   <br>  Septuagint Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus and other earlier papyri Greek 4th century CE <br>   <br>  Peshitta  Syriac early 5th century CE <br>   <br>  Vulgate  Latin early 5th century CE <br>   <br>  Masoretic Aleppo Codex, Leningrad Codex and other incomplete mss Hebrew 10th century CE <br>   <br>  Samaritan Pentateuch  Samaritan alphabet Oldest extant mss c.11th century CE, oldest mss available to scholars 16th century CE <br>   <br>  Targum  Aramaic 11th century CE <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|IqqaA2wIaa	by biblical scholars who know more than we do...|`|AA12203324	Having been an oral history for centuries, with a roughly chronological order, gave people an idea of the general arrangement of the scriptures.  The Jewish order is DIFFERENT from the Christian order.  In Jewish bibles, the Torah is followed by the Prophets, which includes what Christians call the historical and prophetic books, and finally the miscellaneous Writings.  <br>  <br>  But Christians preferred to put the latter prophets at the end of the Bible to suggest an anticipation of the Messiah. (They also arranged some of the Writings that looked like history or prophecy into other sections.)  When they started composing their own scriptures, they naturally put the gospels first, followed by Luke's history book, then all the letters (in order of size), and finally that weird, end-of-time book at the end.  (Although it was probably written first, the gospel of Mark was placed second because it begins and ends abruptly and its Jesus is a little fiercer and more secretive than in the other gospels.)<br>  <br>  As for the medium, it was mostly parchment scrolls until papyrus became available.  Being separate scrolls, they weren't regarded as a monolithic block of literature but were studied and read one at a time.  With the arrival of relatively cheap paper and the codex binding method (1st Century CE), books started being combined together into single volumes and book order became more important.  <br>  <br>  In the Fifth Century, when Jerome translated the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin, he decided to separate the Jewish books that had no Hebrew versions into their own section, naming them the "Apocrypha" ("hidden away").  Since then, Catholic and Protestant bibles with those books arrange them in different orders.<br>  <br>  Preservation was a matter of copying.  People knew then that paper and parchment would wear out, so they kept making copies and didn't worry about the originals.|`|CueEJOVFaa	There were several different criteria for canonicity. Here are four examples:<br>  <br>     1.  Apostolic Origin - attributed to and/or based on the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their closest companions).<br>     2. Universal Acceptance - acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the Mediterranean world (by the end of the fourth century).<br>     3. Liturgical Use - read publicly along with the OT when early Christians gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services).<br>  4. Consistent Message - containing theological ideas compatible with other accepted Christian writings (incl. the divinity and humanity Jesus).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT_Canon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT_C...</a><br>  <br>  Papyrus (scrolls) and parchment (codices) were used before paper.|`|bdf815178b6b27bc8977f0ec0b69e7a2aa	Scripture reveals this Church to be the one Jesus Christ built upon the rock of Saint Peter (Matt. 16:18). By giving Peter the keys of authority (Matt. 16:19), Jesus appointed Peter as the chief steward over His earthly kingdom (cf. Isaiah. 22:19-22). Jesus also charged Peter to be the source of strength for the rest of the apostles (Luke 22:32) and the earthly shepherd of Jesus' flock (John 21:15-17). Jesus further gave Peter, and the apostles and elders in union with him, the power to bind and loose in heaven what they bound and loosed on earth. (Matt. 16:19; 18:18). This teaching authority did not die with Peter and the apostles, but was transferred to future bishops through the laying on of hands (e.g., Acts 1:20; 6:6; 13:3; 8:18; 9:17; 1 Tim. 4:14; 5:22; 2 Tim. 1:6). <br>  <br>  By virtue of this divinely-appointed authority, the Catholic Church determined the canon of Scripture (what books belong in the Bible) at the end of the fourth century. We therefore believe in the Scriptures on the authority of the Catholic Church. After all, nothing in Scripture tells us what Scriptures are inspired, what books belong in the Bible, or that Scripture is the final authority on questions concerning the Christian faith. Instead, the Bible says that the Church, not the Scriptures, is the pinnacle and foundation of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15) and the final arbiter on questions of the Christian faith (Matt. 18:17). It is through the teaching authority and Apostolic Tradition (2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6; 1 Cor. 11:2) of this Church, who is guided by the Holy Spirit (John 14:16,26; 16:13), that we know of the divine inspiration of the Scriptures, and the manifold wisdom of God. (cf. Ephesians 3:10). <br>  <br>  |`|ULUpOqplaa	The bible was put together when Emperor Constantine wanted a political work to unite an empire.  This was the easiest way.|`|xHoq5Ga8aa	Monks that lived in isolated monasteries devoted their time to painstakingly copying the epistles and gospels, as well as the books of the Old Testament, on parchments. In fact, this was a practice that continued to the 15th Century, until the advent of the printing press.<br>  <br>  The other part of your question is related to the the Church Council of Carthage, which created a list of canonical books in 397. This is the council which many Protestant and Evangelical Christians take as the authority for the New Testament canon of books. The Old Testament canon from the same council is identical to Roman Catholic canon today. |`|axT0Gl0haa	The Bible is God's Word.  It was complete in 90AD and passed around to all the churches, as the Bible itself says  :) <br>  <br>  The catholics will come and claim that they "compiled" it, but, the Bible itself contradicts their claim.  Catholicism didn't exist for over 200 years after the Bible was finished.  In reality, catholics tried to murder anyone found owning a Bible.  Millions died.|`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	There was paper at the end of the 4th Century, which is when the bishops of the Catholic Church compiled the Bible.

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	From my understanding of this, across the centuries there have always been a percentage of men out there who enjoy wearing women's clothes. I dont see it as a matter of right or wrong, it's just how you are, although I do understand, at your young age it may be a bit confusing. I think more importantly, as you grow older, if this sort of thing continues to be something you enjoy, you should consider your surroundings, and how people may or may not accept you being this way. What I mean by this is, for example, I live in a small town in Northern California where this sort of thing is rarely, if ever seen, and people here might treat someone like you very badly. My Dad, however, lives in the San Francisco bay area where crossdressing is seen much more often, and is more accepted by people that live in that area.

I believe that you will experienece less stress and pain if you simply accept it as who you are. If you have a girlfriend, she may find your crossdressing acceptable if you limit the amount of time you devote to it; however there are many girls who will accept no amount of crossdressing and, at best, they may just tolerate it.<br>  <br>  Over time it seems to become more accepted by the public  |`|iWDh1k9Haa	Of course it's OK for you to want to wear woman's clothes.<br>  If that is what feels good for you.

Discovering all of those similarities is also lots of fun.  |`|o2WEoWp5aa	It depends how much you want to work. I speak English natively, along with French, Spanish, and I'm learning Mandarin. Mandarin is a lot of work if you aren't a native speaker, so it's probably best that you take something a little less challenging. I would say maybe Japanese. Chinese has multiple levels of what you need to learn, such as tones, characters, pinyin, etc., while Japanese doesn't have the tones, and the base of kanji in Japanese will help immensely when you go to learn Mandarin later on.|`|SWLT97GZaa	C++<br>  <br>  you could get tons of money from that language|`|Nzg6orwRaa	spanish|`|1dzlCe1qaa	Arabic.........

I am reminded of the ice skater Midori Ito some years back.  Anyway, I think you should learn Dutch as a family heritage thing.

o2WEoWp5aa	Well that's really hard to translate because it's not pinyin... There is no way to tell tones based on that, and I'm not really sure how uwwee would be pronounced, but I don't think it was a dis. <br>  <br>  "jonhg" is probably zhong first tone, which means either medium/middle, or Chinese (roughly). There is not ni 3rd tone in this so it's probably not to you, or else it's not a full sentence. And as far as ma, that's a question participle.<br>  <br>  So putting this all together, I'm guessing that your friend is not a native Chinese speaker, and he tried to ask you a question of some sort.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Also, to the person below me, sima does not mean really.

Not all, but most.|`|LhDde5iBaa	there isn't one. it's all the same thing.|`|AA11619206	There is no real difference between a religion and a cult. In fact, nearly all of today's major religions started out as "cults." In fact, the dictionary definition of a cult is simply "a particular system of religious worship." Sometimes people consider a particular following a cult, rather than a religion, simply because it is composed of a smaller group of people than a mainstream or major religion. Also, the word cult generally has a negative connotation-- when people hear the word 'cult,' they assume you are referring to a group of crazies, people who believe in strange things, perform weird or satanic ceremonies or rituals, etc. But, the bottom line is there is actually NO real difference between a religion and a cult. |`|7PaRoB6faa	The usual accepted difference between a religion and a cult is that cults are harmful emotionally or mentally to the people in them, and are controlling. This means going beyond simple things like "do not eat pork" or "do not steal", People choose to follow or not follow those parts of their religions. It means controlling things like who they marry, where they live, what job they do, who they talk to, what they think, making them do illegal things, extorting money, etc. That is what makes a cult a cult. |`|1yIXkBwwaa	Depends on who has the better Public Relations and Propaganda machinery behind them. |`|BDGTdFIdaa	Social acceptance|`|evBc5X82aa	Look as Jonestown.|`|PMKAO3Xwaa	there is no difference.

Lets not screw them up even more. |`|KXQVRQdjaa	golfman: I wasn't aware that people who don't have kids are "biologically useless."  That is a cruel and nasty thing to say.  I won't report you because you should show the world what a creep you are.  If you teach your kids that kind of stuff, you are parentaly useless!<br>  <br>  But back to the question.  Every psychological, psychiatric, pediatric, and child wellfare agency has come to the conclusion that gays and lesbians are just as good of parents as anyone else.  Those children score just as well on tests of intelligence, social adjustment, ethics, mental health, creativity, and emotional capacity as any other group of kids.  Higher than other children in lack of prejudice and bigotry.  There is no sane reason to prevent gays adopting children.<br>  <br>  The "children are cruel" argument is useless because the problem is bigotry, not gays being parents.  Fix the REAL problem - people raising their kids to hate!|`|pO8OzblHaa	I agree with you one hundred percent.|`|AA11923447	No, I am not.

I'm all for it.|`|cRTD17ekaa	WELL, SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY...I AGREE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY !!! GOOD QUESTION !!!! GOD BLESS YOU !!!|`|hYzfzu9yaa	No. There are so many children in need of homes and families. It is cruel to shuffled them from home to home to home and deny them a loving home because of misconception and prejudice.<br>  <br>  My mother was a foster parent. We took a lot of children who needed homes, but no one wanted older kids, or black or hispanic kids. We had a 9 years old who had been through 10 different homes before coming to us. Her little brother - at the age of two - had been through five. Some of the homes they shuffled into were more abusive than their real parents. Foster homes are not a good way to raise children! So many children are just pushed through the system with no stability, no real homes or families, until they reach 18 - and then they are spit out and left to fend for themselves with no support, no back-up, nothing. It is sickening!<br>  <br>  Kids need families. There are couples out there willing to taken them in and give them homes and stability - but are being denies for petty reasons - many of which (like being beat up in school for having two daddies, or being depressed or molested or other such lies) have been proved unsubstantiated.|`|DdLfaEzNaa	So the solution is not to allow gays to adopt children.  The solution is to teach people how to be better parents and better partners in a marriage relationship so they can have stronger families.  Allowing gays to marry and adopt children will not solve the problems the world faces in regards to how many children are in foster care, etc.  Homosexuality may be inherent, but it is still wrong and children brought up in that environment will not be taught right from wrong.  Children are entitled to having both a mother and father who love one another and honor their marital vows completely.  Any other way is not good enough.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Yes, because I believe homosexuality is immoral. Isn't a good moral foundation important for a child's mental/emotional development? For very young children, that would be traumatizing, because it's supposed to be mommy and daddy, or just mommy or just daddy, not two mommies or two daddies. An older child (10-17), might appreciate it, and would understand the situation better, he or she might be happy for someone to take care of him or her, or get upset that their foster parents are gay.|`|87a97307eb84f6b093dc19657dda478aaa	Yes I agree. But what's far more important and would prove to be much more affective in reducing or even eliminating the need for foster care, is for people to be responsible with themselves. For parents to Teach their children to be responsible instead of Encouraging what is careless, harmful, and irresponsible. It's insane and barbaric. We're human beings with a Brain, made to be intelligent, not animals.<br>  <br>  MILLIONS of children Growing up Without a loving family. It's amazing how much that number has GROWN. With what we got coming they might as well abort if they wont raise them, because their killing them anyway.|`|0b8522019203b6bb4a40d4d02c80d76aaa	Gays should be able to adopt children. I think a child needs love in a stable environment. Many children who are raised by same-sex couples have flourished in their lives because they have a place to call home, and people to call family.<br>  Another reason why gay marriage should be allowed!!|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	I know lots of gay couples who would make far better parents than the average straight couple. So I think what should be done is what is best for the child, which is to place it with the most loving family available. In many cases this might be a gay couple. And I fail to see why that would create any problems.|`|qLLijfy8aa	my moms best friend is a gay may with  2 wonderful kids who are smart and charismatic.<br>  <br>  a loving home is all a child needs...<br>  <br>  its sad that people let hate get in the way of a child's best interest.<br>  <br>  |`|z9DHcjHnaa	I could deal with three or four hot lesbians adopting me and showing me all of their hot and wet monkey love.|`|upAf4ysEaa	No, I believe in equality. |`|NiTDu05Baa	lmao@ Darth McCain hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|TwcAQPupaa	Yes.<br>  And, no.

zLNWYrl9aa	The problem is that if a country makes gay marriage legal it opens the door to children being adopted or surrogate to gay relationships.  Study after study has shown that children grow up best in a stable relationship with a mum and a dad.  Beside any moral concern I have, this is the main reason I oppose gay marriage.<br>  <br>  I am also against the normalising of the gay lifestyle in society.  I believe that sexuality is primarily something we are born with (scientists are now discovering the huge differences between male and female apart from the bleeding obvious) but it can also be a learned behaviour.  Children need good role models to develop properly.  I don;t think being raised in a gay household will do this.<br>  <br>  Personally, I get really tired of the token gay person that is thrown into every second scene on TV or movies.  The reality is that gays are still a very small minority and I think society will be better off if it stays that way.<br>  <br>  One final point,  I find when you talk to people one on one, MOST of them do not agree with gay marriage. They might not say so publicly for fear of looking homophobic (whatever that is!!) but deep down MOST do not approve.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	The rivers will turn to blood, toads will fall out of the sky, everyone will instantly get divorced, no more babies will be born, etc. etc.|`|641d79f1fb962fec1327d88ec4977c9daa	I guess some are afraid they are going to influence others into being Gay, who are not. And I've known men who were led to believe they were Gay and weren't, and went through hell before they found their own identity.<br>   A Man can be Feminine, and not be Gay, or a Woman Masculine, and not be Lesbian.

Wishful thinking and  a grave mistake. Does stealing affect anyone? Does drug abuse affect anyone else but the user? Does lying? Does cheating? Does extra marital affairs? So is homosexuality in a class of it's own where no one gets hurt? 25 million people have died of aids and 33 million more infected including babies and blood transfusion recipients.. How can this possibly hurt anyone? If same sex marriage is legalized then those who don't agree with it can be sued if they don't perform the marriage such as a judge even if it's against his religion. Caterers who may have moral objections would be forced to service the wedding party of face being sued. Photographers or advertisers who objected could be sued for not providing services. These are just a few examples of how anyone with religious objections could be forced to comply or face being sued. So don't believe them when they say it isn't going to affect anyone who is not gay.|`|RNmCUNOvaa	If we let gays marry each other then we will have to teach our 7 year old kids in our sexuality classes that it is okay for gays to get married. We would have to make it so it was okay for gays to adopt children... Which would affect those children greatly. It would make it so descent people who don't put from the ruff will not be able to continue to have adoption services because they refuse to help out the fags. And worst off it would be calling evil, good. It hurts everyone... Especially the people getting married in a sinful relationship.|`|AA10239241	Blacks and whites intermarrying used to be illegal -- but it was never immoral. Its fine for them to intermarry.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage is an oxymoron and degrades the very definition of marriage which should be between one man and one woman only who are previously unrelated to the third degree of sanguination (third cousins).

I believe that homosexuality is wrong, just like stealing, lying, cheating, etc., is wrong. Because I wouldn't condone any of those things I also wouldn't condone homosexual marriage. <br>  <br>  I know that many people believe that homosexuals are born that way and cannot help their same-gender attraction, but I disagree. It has been proven that people have natural tendencies to be murderers, alcoholics, drug addicts, etc. We don't condone those activities, we expect these people to overcome their natural desire toward these tendencies. <br>   <br>  Because I believe that homosexuality is wrong I don't want it to become common and accepted in society, just like I don't want drug abuse to be common and accepted in society. <br>  <br>  Being black or white on the other hand is truly something that cannot be changed. Therefore I do think that limiting marriage between a black and white is not right. <br>  <br>  While I doubt that you agree with me on my belief that homosexuality is wrong, I am just being honest as to why I, and I believe others are in opposition to gay marriage|`|2NqaeCevaa	The law against blacks and whites marrying was not discriminatory because it applied to both races equally.

As long as one partner is male and one partner is female they can get married so the law is not discriminatory.|`|YcDL1C1naa	That's like asking if the legalization of alcohol increased its use.<br>  <br>  to ignore the social implications of calling a life relationship of sex between two guys or two girls is just untruthful.<br>  <br>  It will change the way marriage is taught in the schools to your children.  You may like that or dislike that but at least acknowledge it.<br>  <br>  It will change the definition of marriage.  People who act like this isn't a change in the way we define marriage are kidding themselves.<br>  <br>  It will change the importance of marriage.  We have already seen a decline in marriage and couples living together without getting married, this further diminishes the importance and significance of marriage.  It isn't about a family it's about just two people with no physical qualifications for being together.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -<br>  further clarification -<br>  When gay marriage is accepted and endorsed by society it WILL affect society.  This is a no-brainer.  <br>  <br>  Homosexuality, from a purely secular perspective, is not natural, even if you just believe we all just evolved you have to look at this behavior and say "this is obviously NOT what people of the same sex were made to do together".<br>  <br>  It's not hateful to note that homosexuality has higher instances of the spreading of disease, domestic violence, and psychological problems associated with those who engage in it. To put an approval on this relationship is not good for society as it will increase the instances of it.  Kids will, as they already are, experiment more with it.|`|yyowvvBqaa	Because our nation is a cess-pool enough as it is. We don't need to throw more gas on the fire and whine and ***** because there are still plenty of people in this country who have standards and inherently believe and know that certain actions and behaviours are objectively better than others.<br>  <br>  And stop trying to link blacks and whites getting married to this social disease called "gay marriage".<br>  <br>  Blacks are a class of people with identifiable rights as minorities.<br>  <br>  Gays are NOT a class of people; they have chosen their lifestyle regardless of all the junk science out there prostituting itself just to appease the lunatics and be politically correct so they can qualify for government funding which comes out of my tax dollars, too.<br>  <br>  I don't need two psychologically deranged morons living next door to me where my grand kids come and visit me and have to see that crap.<br>  <br>  "Gee, Grand-dad; why are those two men kissing each other?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Please.

But it also can express whether someone is married, single, taken, etc by which hand it is worn on and which side of the ring is facing outward.  |`|nJHZQ5ylaa	The Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart, and usually surmounted by a crown. The elements of this symbol are often said to correspond to the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). The expression which was associated with these symbols in the giving of the ring was: "With my hands I give you my heart, and crown it with my love."<br>  <br>  The way that a Claddagh ring is worn on the hand is usually intended to convey the wearer's romantic availability, or lack thereof. Traditionally, if the ring is on the right hand with the design facing outward and away from the body, this indicates that the person wearing the ring is not in any serious relationship, and may in fact be single and looking for a relationship. When worn on the right hand but with the design facing inward toward the body, this indicates the person wearing the ring is in a relationship, or that "someone has captured their heart". A Claddagh worn on the left hand ring finger, facing outward away from the body, generally indicates that the wearer is engaged. When the ring is on the left hand ring finger and facing inward toward the body, it generally means that the person wearing the ring is married<br>  |`|jZeo2MQ8aa	the heart stands for love, the hands for friendship and the crown for loyalty to the king. it is of irish origin, and the english were very much up in their country trying to put the irish people under english rule, so the loyalty to the king is a way stating their pride in their countries Independence from british rule.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Aside from the design itself standing for love (heart), loyalty (crown) and friendship (hands holding the heart) - how the ring is worn also has specific meanings:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.claddagh.kaijewels.com/claddagh-history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.claddagh.kaijewels.com/cladda...</a><br>  |`|wM4ikYDzaa	the heart-love, the crown-loyalty and the hands-friendship

I don't think you can take communion if you married outside the Catholic Church.|`|XowM9e7Naa	Yes, all Catholics have an obligation to make their Sunday obligation, no matter what the status of their marriage is. Your marriage is not a sacramental marriage nor has it been entered into Church records, so the Church does not recognize it, because you did not follow the legal niceties required.  Remember to keep prayer in your life, whatever you do.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	In order for your Marriage to be considered Valid you will need to have the Church Bless it. Other wise your not able to receive the eucharist. But it sounds like you put your emotional feelings before God and his Church.

And they blow it off like since it's "their" word then they have the right to reclaim it however they wish I guess?  I don't know, but when I hear people doing that I'm like "oh, right...I'm sure that inanimate object or situation is overwhelmed with sexual attractions to another inanimate object or situation of the same gender..I mean since, inanimate objects or abstract ideas have a binary gender construct in our society".  <br>  <br>  And then people just look at me and are like "huh"? <br>  <br>  And then I explain "you're using "that's so gay" to describe an inanimate object that is awkward, queer, quirky, dumb, or stupid..so in essence you've just described all gay people with these inferred negative adjectives.

You haven't eaten for so long, your body probably thinks you're in a famine or something, so whatevr food it gets, its stores and doesn't use up. If you're not active, (which in most cases you aren't cause you're so darn weak feeling) your metabolism slows down too to use as little energy as possible to survive. Me, I usually stay the same or gain a pound or 2. It has a lot to do with what you eat at iftar too, I mean, you haven't eaten all day, the fattiest and sweetest things seem so APPETIZING!!! yumm...another thing about ramadan that i love: everything tastes so good and you are so appreciative!|`|nyReGoBhaa	Yes I do lose wieght during Ramadan...!|`|AA10928742	I am sure most do, i have heard of a person who has lost some 50 kilos. dunno if he was lying though|`|sna0p2djaa	no, i probably gain weight, all that oily desi food...how can u not gain weight? lol|`|AA12279768	The reason people gain weight when they fast is that they dont follow the Sunnah in fasting. <br>  <br>  For the Suhoor they'll eat heavy which is something discouraged. <br>  <br>  For the Iftaar they will eat until the time of Iqaamah and sometimes after. The sunnah is to break fast with 3 dates and a cup of water or milk and then to pray the Maghrib salaah and then to have a dinner. <br>  <br>  Most people have a dinner before the Maghrib, after the Maghrib, after the Taraweeh, before they sleep, pre-Suhoor meal, Suhoor and the cycle goes on.<br>  <br>  Eating too much for Iftaar is a bad idea because the body slows down the metabolism during the fast.|`|PXI5lAsuaa	It really all depends on what diet you keep during the month.  I try to eat more natural foods during that month and avoid fried foods, carbs and junk food.  When it's time to break fast, I will drink a glass of water before I eat my food, it helps to not over eat- not that that really happens during that month anyway; I feel like I have no appetite during that month.  After eating and before sleeping I recommend getting some exercise, even if it's just taking a walk.  It helps to digest your food and burn some calories before you sleep.  It's also a nice way to spend time with family during that month, I like to walk with my Mom and we have nice talks then.  At suhoor I would say to just eat raw fruits and vegetables.  I tend to maintain my weight during Ramadan, not gaining or losing.|`|8Cg4ZEr1aa	No. If anything we put on weight with all the lovely food we have at Iftaar.<br>  <br>  Let's remember those who have nothing to eat in Sehri & at Iftaar. Pray for them and help them with donations if possible.<br>  <br>  And let's thank Allah for all the blessings he has showered upon us. Alhamdulillah.|`|Lfte0yQdaa	Actually I end up gaining a little weight, it's becuz of all the rich foods at the Masjid for dinner everyday, and all the snacks throughout the night...|`|3FA8auySaa	Well sorta really i only lose like 1 or 2 pounds. Ramadan isn't really about losing weight or anything . But anyways yea i lose some weight but not that much u can actually gain weigh too.|`|B3gREJOEaa	No not really and it doesn't bother me.<br>  Because that isn't our purpose for fasting.|`|78887a6f9ae97cfbe40c3aa6a52448f5aa	yeah about 5-7 punds in a week|`|dUBPvt6Faa	yeh, i grow thinner|`|CvYdrhMBaa	Yes..hardly 2-3 kg:)<br>  <br>  But most people eat lot of non veg and fried items during ramdan ..finally gaining weight..<br>  <br>  This takes away the whole spirit of fasting..Are we fasting so that we can eat like animals at night..wow..Great moral to be learned by this great act..wow...|`|QHHzYVmsaa	I lose weight all the time :S|`|DUsx0Mwxaa	I lose weight cos i'm a fussy time eater. :P|`|2TYZZYTMaa	No my weight remains the same

But if I was gonna I would wear black web like stocking and would make the bottom look warn and tasseled. Then I would buy a cape to match the stockings and boots that laced and came to mid calf. That would be a great witch outfit. There is a magazine with mystic and witch like clothes in it called pyramid. The link is below. It has great things in that cost a lot but not as much as that dress.|`|8826af91a1a8af16c8350ffa918c8844aa	Unless you sew some costumey type things to this dress I can't really see how it could turn into a witch outfit...even with witch type accessories I still do not think it would fit the bill (and the price is way too high to alter it in anyway)...you are better off buying something simple and inexpensive and go to town on it! (you can actually buy some mesh  and cut into a web design , attach it to the hem and sleeves of the dress and and glue some spiders on it  to add drama)......<br>  <br>  whatever you decide remember to have fun....Best of luck finding what you are looking for....

G2PyGUeWaa	Is it still advisable to wear a condom?<br>  <br>  YES YES YES YES YES YES YES<br>  <br>  If so, why?<br>  <br>  Oh, so many reasons.  Have you ever heard of a cure for AIDS?  No?  Do you know why you haven't?  Because they haven't found one yet.  Have you ever heard of a vaccine for AIDS?  No?  Do you know why?  Because they haven't found one yet.  Now then, knowing this much, would you go down on someone that you knew with 100% certainty was HIV+?  No?  Then why would you go down on someone when you don't know their HIV status.<br>  <br>  Now, if all that were not enough there are a whole host of other STDs that you can get simply with oral contact.<br>  <br>  Finally, since you are both virgins, then aren't you OK to just go for it?  Well, that's just the problem.  Do you know in what section of the population the fastest growing rate of HIV is occurring right now?  It's in the young "so called virgin" gay male population.  None of you guys were around back in the 1980's when the rest of us were literally attending funerals on a weekly basis of all our friends and colleagues, so you don't don't how scary that is.  You all seem to believe that if you will just have sex with each other and not us old guys, then you will be safe because you are all virgins.<br>  <br>  Well, that would work fine if the chain would never be broken, but unfortunately, all it takes is just one guy to wander outside the bounds of "young gay male virgins" and then the entire chain gets broken.<br>  <br>  If you want to live a long life of being out of the closet and having a very healthy sex life for the next 40 years (like I have), then you need to play safe - every single time.

I also heard elite is more reliable but not sure.|`|mUVHaXsjaa	Ok, to make this simple...<br>  <br>  The Elite is just what it says... it is the "Cream of the Crop", the "Premium Gasoline" of Xboxes... it comes with a *much* larger hard drive (160GB) to store saved game data, and downloads from Xbox Live...  it also comes with wireless remotes and HDMI output / High Def ready. This unit plays both XBOX 360 games as well as Legacy XBOX Games.<br>  <br>  The Xbox 360 "Premium" console (the standard) is the equivilant of "Silver" or Mid-grade Gasoline...  it has  High Def ready via Component cables but Lacks HDMI output (supports 1080i but not 1080p), but comes with a smaller hard drive measuring only 60GB.  This unit plays both XBOX 360 games as well as Legacy XBOX Games.<br>  <br>  This leads me to the XBOX Arcade...<br>  It is worse than "Regular" gasoline!!!  you might as well compare it to running diesel in a gasoline only car!...  It plays XBOX360 Games only, does NOT have ANY High Def capabilities out of the box,  and only comes with built in, 250MB of memory to store game saves!!! that is PUNY compared to 60GB.  (1024MB = 1GB....  60GB = 61,440MB.... that's 240 times LESS than the "mid-grade" xbox)<br>  <br>  So what should you buy...  it's easy... DO NOT buy the Elite... you will regret it...  and DO NOT buy the Arcade... you might as well give him a paper weight.<br>  <br>  Spend the few extra dollars more than the arcade, and buy him the "Standard" or "Premium" units... you won't regret it as it isn't "crippled.|`|fvYDB7fXaa	Why is this under Mythology and Folklore...?

496210ba9b559f312bfbf939da2754b7aa	Regarding The Word, God:<br>  <br>  1) Kudos to the answerer who enlightened us that ‘God’ is not a name. If you don’t believe me, just look at the Old Testament in its original Hebrew language. At least in the older days, most other religions (and even Christianity, at a time) had many, many names for our gods. It’s a pity they changed it to the impersonal ‘God’.<br>  <br>  2) The English language – and much of the Western world (it is kind of historical, not just my personal bias) – has painted monotheism (make that Christianity) with favour.<br>  <br>  Here is something I picked up from Wiki. It’s about as close as it gets to answering your question explicitly:<br>  <br>  “The capitalized form God was first used in Wulfila's Gothic translation of the New Testament, to represent the Greek Theos. In the English language, the capitalization continues to represent a distinction between monotheistic "God" and "gods" in polytheism.”<br>  <br>  Why Some 'Revere God' But Not The Rest Of The Language:<br>  <br>  3) Possibly, many here are Christians who learnt about the Bible before learning other things in life.<br>  <br>  4) Possibly, many here are young enough to still be going to English class.<br>  <br>  Put points 3 and 4 together and figure it.|`|H7L66ynJaa	Sorry, you are right.|`|sP8KrvA7aa	What are you talking about?

8TqsmDxnaa	That is a myth, the sun is not bad for you.  The myth began when skin cancer started becoming an everyday problem and the sun was given credit for the cancer.<br>  <br>  The truth is, without the sun, your body cannot make vitamin D, without vitamin D your body is unable to utilize other vitamins and minerals your body needs.  Man made vitamin D is very difficult for the body to absorb and thus most people are deficient in vitamins and minerals.  This deficiency causes sickness, cancer, etc.<br>  <br>  Skin cancer comes about from the burning of the skin and not having the right amount of nutrients for your body to repair the damage.  Sunsceen is also to blame, it blocks vitamin D plus the skin absorbs the chemicals in the sunscreen which causes damage.  One study showed a direct link to cancer with use of sunscreen.<br>  <br>  Solution:  Get educated and make sure you get the proper amount of nutrients which means vitamins and minerals.  If you have that, your skin will tan properly and you will not burn.  <br>  <br>  The only time you have a problem is if you burn.<br>  <br>  Without the sun nothing could live...|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	The sun is not bad for you in small amounts. It's overexposure to sun's UV rays that can be bad.  Expose to the sun in the right amounts provides necessary Vitamin D for the body. Doctors are now saying people aren't getting enough Vitamin D because they're staying out of the sun and not drinking enough milk.<br>  <br>  So on the next sunny day, slather on that sunscreen and enjoy the rays! It's good for ya  :)|`|kbXTofhEaa	because everything is bad for you<br>  <br>  things are only good in moderation<br>  <br>  the sun does much better things for you then bad....think about life without sunlight

oXypvgK7aa	Very true. In a world where free will is given, what possible good would it do anyone is they had no clear choices in life. Without evil how could you choose good?|`|AA11990031	God is above both good and evil.|`|76hNV3iqaa	God made everyone and gave them free will. Therefore he is apart of everyone but they may choose to not be apart of him. You can be however you want, he didn't make anyone evil. We decide how we are going to be Good or evil... This is something  My old Sunday School teacher use to teach us that.<br>  You have to have God to be good just add the "o."<br>  God= "Good" just add the "O" to the spelling of God and you have Good. <br>  You can't have the Devil without Evil. <br>  Devil= Evil just add the "D" to the word Evil and you have the Devil.<br>  I just thought it was cute how she use to explain this to us.<br>  |`|m3Igki7qaa	God is not part of everything. God was around before everything. God created everything. God is not dependent on creation. He fills and transcends all of space and time.|`|utbfT0APaa	You obviously don't know God.. Get acquainted with Him and then reassess your question.|`|yAvTxh47aa	How can someone accept god into their heart if he's everywhere and already there?|`|4fTiCNiKaa	At first it might seem that if God created all things then evil must have been created by God. However, there is an assumption here that needs to be cleared up. Evil is not a "thing" - like a rock or electricity. You can't have a jar of evil! Rather, evil is something that occurs, like running. Evil has no existence of its own - it is really a lack in a good thing. For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else. We call the absence of dirt a hole - but it cannot be separated from the dirt. So when God created, it is true that all that existed was good. One of the good things that God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good. In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose. So God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or non-good (evil). When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a "thing" that required God to create it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a further illustration will help. If I were to ask the average person "does cold exist?" - his/her answer would likely be yes. However, this is incorrect. Cold does not exist. Cold is the absence of heat. Similarly, darkness does not exist. Darkness is the absence of light. Similarly, evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God. God did not have to create evil, but rather only allow for the absence of good.<br>  <br>  Look at the example of Job in Job chapters 1-2. Satan wanted to destroy Job, and God allowed Satan to do everything but kill Job. God allowed this to happen to prove to Satan that Job was righteous because he loved God, not because God had blessed him so richly. God is sovereign and ultimately in control of everything that happens. Satan cannot do anything that God does not allow. God did not create evil, but He allows evil. If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice. He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their "programming." God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could genuinely have a free will and choose whether we wanted to serve Him or not.<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  (((SFCU)))|`|0DqTd733aa	OK..let explain it this way.<br>  GOD is LIGHT.<br>  is there any shadow in LIGHT?<br>  NO.<br>  <br>  OK..GOD is pure clean WATER.<br>  is there DIRT in water if water is pure and clean?

God is the greatest contradiction ever.  He is, and yet he is not.  He is the beginning, and yet he is the end.  He is everywhere, and yet nowhere.  He is good, and yet allows evil.  God caused the Big Bang and evolution, and yet seems to play no role in it's outcome.  God supposedly gives man free will, and yet already knows what our decision will be and so has our destiny already planned.

He hopes that we will not fall victim to the tempations while we reside here in Hell. Faith helps to protect you.

Where we are composed of flesh and blood, He is composed of spirit.   In the case of Jesus Christ, He was converted from spirit to flesh for several reasons:<br>  <br>  1)  To die and pay the death penalty for sin.<br>  <br>  2)   As an example of how to live.<br>  <br>  3)  To start the NT Church.<br>  <br>  It is also written that although He was human, He was also without sin.  He was flesh, but His Mind and Heart were the character of God (Heb. 4:15).<br>  <br>  Here is another key to understanding.  A lot is said and written about how much Christ loved humanity and so died for them.  This is very true, but most people do not know how much He loved them.<br>  <br>  Not taking anything away from His Sacrifice and Death, but understand that Hebrews says He was "tempted in all points, yet without sin."<br>  <br>  This means that He did not sin, but He could have.  It was possible for Him to sin because He shed His power to become human.  Jesus Christ, our Maker, put His own Eternity on the line.  Had He sinned, He Himself would have required a redeemer.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ lived and perfect life and died without sin.  He paid the death penalty for all humans.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|yzRHAWNhaa	You just don't get it yet,... do you?

His soul or spirit kept on living—just as ours will when we die. Almost His final words from the cross were these: "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (Luke 23:46).<br>  <br>  But Jesus' spirit was different from ours—and one of the ways it was different was its absolute holiness and purity. We are sinners, stained by our disobedience and rebellion against God. But Jesus was without sin; in fact, He bore in His spirit the very nature of God Himself. As the Bible says, "He is the image of the invisible God. ... For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him" (Colossians 1:15, 19).<br>  <br>  Jesus' spirit, however, was different from ours in another way: On the cross, all the sins of the human race were poured out upon Him. He was without sin—but on the cross, all our sins were placed on Him, and He took the judgment and Hell we deserve so we could be forgiven and saved. Our sins were transferred to Him—and His righteousness was transferred to us.<br>  <br>  We will never fully understand the wonder and mystery of Christ's nature and His sacrifice for us—not until we enter heaven. But don't let that keep you from Christ! God loves you, and the proof is that His Son was willing to give His life for your salvation. By faith open your heart to Him today.|`|TotgRmRZaa	he did die in human form.their are three persons in one god.a mystery you and i will learn,when we die.god sacrificed the son.so while the son was being mortal,and exposing phonies.god the father,and god the holy spirit were minding the store.two out of three aint bad.|`|PXMqXwflaa	If you stop and think about it a bit, rather than cite, by rote, the cultural beliefs spoon-fed you as a child, doesn't the whole God thing sound like something Stan Lee might have thought up for an upcoming issue? <br>  <br>  It's a great story, filled with good and evil, impossible characters, twists and turns at every development and horrific fight scenes and cliff-hangers. And while many of us want to believe in the triumph of purity over darkness, and in the guy wearing the white robe with halo, sometimes evil does triumph. (ie. cancer, the Nixon years, "My Mother The Car," Rush Limbaugh, underwear that chaffs, PE teachers, Nancy Pelosi, parking meters, cold pizza, etc.)<br>  <br>  God may exist. Then again, He, She or It (hereafter 'He') may not. But if He does, I don't think his motivations can be explained by us, anymore than we can know exactly how He wants us to believe or what 'ism' we should follow.<br>  <br>  Live your life as best you can without hurting others. The dogma doesn't matter; it only divides us and keeps us from what we should be doing. Evil is/was Inquisitions for anyone who thinks differently, terrorist bombings, rockets fired into residential areas, sending people to gas chambers and following any belief that pits one group of 'true believers' against another.<br>  <br>  You need to step away from our concept of God to actually look for him. You won't find God in the closed minds of others, nor in the writings handed down by old guys in robes. <br>  <br>  Try thinking for yourself, regardless of how uncomfortable that may be and where it might take you.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

cXtEx98Haa	The first one is better, though I won't say the second one is incorrect, just not good usage.<br>  <br>  You need a preposition to modifify when they begin.  You have AFTER graduation, so you don't need the in.  If you didn't have after graduation, then "Repayments begin in six months."  would be correct.|`|dca2c702f1f138a553055a97f5b22bd4aa	They are the same.|`|tiUh1lMaaa	The second is grammatically incorrect, I'm pretty sure.<br>  "Repayments being in six months."<br>  That would be right. Or,<br>  "Repayments begin six months after graduation."<br>  Both of those are correct.

Many silly questions are asked about Noah and the ark but if people read their bibles (or read it online if they don't own one) they would see the answers before they even ask the question.<br>  <br>  someg - The gene pool on the ark would not have been all that small.

It is there fore not killing. <br>  <br>  But it does not really matter one way or the other if you think it is good or bad, because the truth is it with out properly maintained clinics, desperate women will return to using the back street abortionists using a dirty knitting needle and causing mass murder again. <br>  <br>  If you have no compassion for their plight, you are ungodly and full of disease.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	But babies aren't' possessions.

MOST women seek abortions because they think they don't have any choice. Ironic, huh?<br>  <br>  In fact, for MOST women, abortion is a horrible choice. They don't want to have an abortion, but they feel like they must. They are being pressured by their partners, their parents, their friends, their financial circumstances, their careers, their social standing, whatever.<br>  <br>  Any time a person feels that killing another human being is their only way out, they are in an abusive situation. <br>  <br>  The whole problem with the abortion rights movement is that it legalizes the abuse of women. It enables parents to threaten their teenage daughters unless they abort. It enables men to threaten their female partners with abandonment unless they abort. It enables employers to discriminate against mothers. It enables profiteering companies like Planned Parenthood (YES, they profit big-time!) to exploit the poor, the minorities, the immigrants by placing clinics in their neighborhoods and pressuring women to abort. (The founders of Planned Parenthood were EXTREMELY racist and actually thought Hitler was doing a good thing with his whole ethnic cleansing idea...look it up!)<br>  <br>  Abortion wounds women and attacks motherhood, in addition to murdering unborn humans. It is a scourge on our society that must be erased. But just outlawing isn't enough -- our society has to grow to the point where we treasure motherhood and welcome children before we get to the point where women don't feel like they have to kill their own offspring.|`|CfWXgwxBaa	This is a very romantic way to see abortion.But,I am afraid that the overwhelming majority of people who actually had an abortion,did not exactly have your idea in mind babe.|`|pFZtcix8aa	As someone who considers the greatest gift in my life to be my two adopted children, I would have to answer your question with a resounding No.|`|5e50c0ab71cc45110b7754fc5ce9ee2daa	There is no reason that you can give that would justify the killing of an innocent little baby for someone else's sin<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kp|`|biPAZ2TVaa	God didn't ask you to sacrifice a baby.

Medically u r dead when u have no pulse or brain waves and when u have a pulse and brain waves u r medically alive.  So a baby or fetus(fyi fetus means little one:)).  is alive.   Well that child couldnt live outside the womb or without the babies mother.  A 4 yr. Old is still dependent on a parent or adult, cuz the 4 yr. Old cuz it needs food, emotional support, love, shelter clothing.  Till u r moved out u r still dependent on ur parents even once u have moved out alot of times for collage they chip in cash.  So until u r tot removed from u parents help r u still a applicant 4 abortion?  So when u r 14 yrs oldand ur rents decide to abort u cuz ur to expensiv thats ok? <br>  I doubt abortions will b done with sewing needles.  They will b done by ex abortionist who need the cash and have the special vaccums with a little knife on it so they can chopp up and suck up that little baby.<br>  No its not like sending the child ack to God b cuz that women is still taking part in murder and God is the only person to decide who can live and die. :)|`|AA11631237	Yes,you give birth to a child and he now he has the choice either to live or die.dont do it for him|`|1aCiHd96aa	Not really like giving back to God, but even I'm Christian, I'm for abortion, everyone has right to do it, better than hate that child and your life after, and I know many cases|`|pfqYcdG9aa	oh dear. we all know this is going to end badly|`|Ys2UwE3jaa	Carlyjj941, we believe that we existed before we were born living with god. We were only spirits an saw the glorified body of God and desired to get a body as well. Therefore the earth was founded, that we get a body there, to get experiences and then return to God. In a great Council God presented us his plan of salvation. We were all happy. It offered us the possibility to turn back to God.<br>  Till then the spirits are waiting for some parents, who provide them their body.<br>  And there is a spirit which is happy to find some parents. Perhaps before they were born, they have been the best friends. And now the mother refused to bear a child. It is a great gift from God, this posibility to become mother. Can you imagine who sad is this spirit, that cannot come to earth although his life had been planned by the body, which was aborted? <br>  Before you come to earth you has promised to help other spirits to come here, perhaps you have promised it to your best friend. <br>  <a href="http://www.mormonwiki.com/Abortion" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormonwiki.com/Abortion</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=c79b8949f2f6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=d11d88c617b9c110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg...</a><br>  The two last sermons were held by a medical scientist.<br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=024644f8f206c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=29a518e7c379b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=dfae535cedb1c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg...</a>|`|e934d8011992b7643157c6eb91e2a37baa	No. It is taking a life.

urlDKYPraa	Wow.  Thanks for showing me that wiki link. I strongly feel that I want my body to rot naturally and I want to be buried in a shallow grave with a simple biodegradable coffin. Preferably a coffin made of recycled materials. I do NOT want to be embalmed. Embalming fluid turns to the same chemical as bee-sting toxin inside all your veins. I know I won't feel it, but that's nasty!<br>  <br>  I was told that law requires embalming, but your link says otherwise. Perhaps I should look into it.<br>  <br>  As an atheist, I think that the best way to die is to go back to nature. Plant a tree on top of me, and I will become part of every leaf and twig. The sun will shine on me and the breezes will caress me.<br>  <br>  Of course my sentient mind will no longer exist. But my atoms will be reused by nature, and that's good enough for me.|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	Well, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think the soil WANTS all the crap in my system.|`|6nrLRKmeaa	a great idea, the body is just rotting flesh after our energy leaves (yes energy does factually and scientifically leave the body shortly after death) and people need to be more aware of that. We are not made of embalming fluid, cotton, and loads of make up when we're alive, so why pretend in death?|`|6mXvwy7Jaa	I worked with a former morgue worker and he said that if everyone knew what the body has to go through to be embalmed(as many are) you would never want it for yourself or any of your loved ones. <br>  <br>  It is kinda like taxidermy in many ways. <br>  <br>  He said he wanted to be cremated but even then, they just throw you in there. <br>  <br>  I want to be buried under a tree or something. I find it creepy to have my body around after I am dead(so embalming is out) and being burned is a waste of energy and nutrients. I am not going to use it, so why ca't a tree have it?<br>  <br>  If I could legally be fed to animals... maybe that would be okay too. <br>  <br>  I don't want to be a waste of space and energy even when I'm dead!|`|gzy0B5Y5aa	my personal favorite is sky burial, you are no longer using your body so why not feed it to hungry animals? RIGHT?!<br>  <br>  as much as i dislike religion as a whole... those budhists... i don't even know what i was about to say... just... those budhists... very logical and ahead of their time, perfect combination of logic and spirituality.|`|1n6LMCS3aa	Burial for any reason is a waste of land.

iHDYncuXaa	Here are just a few of the many references of the Rapture in the Bible (NIV Version): <br>  <br>  Christ will bring raptured Church (his believers) to place he prepared: John 14:1-3 - "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am." <br>  <br>  The followers of Jesus will be removed to safety while those still on the Earth will face the tribulation period: Revelation 3:10 - " Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth." <br>  <br>  In the verse above we are told that the 'followers' of Jesus, those that have kept his commands (followed his commandments) and accepted him as lord and savior, will be kept from the time of trouble (tribulation), so here we have the proof of a pre-tribulation rapture. In 1 Thessalonians 4: 16-17 we are told how this incredible event will take place: <br>  1 Thessalonians 4: 16-17 - "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever." <br>  <br>  There are even more references to the church being delivered from the tribulation. Also, remember what happened back in the days of Noah. In a sense there was a rapture that occurred then also. Noah and his family, the only true believers and followers of God, were removed from the earth (raptured) by the safety of God to the Ark, while the rest of the earth’s people suffered and died. <br>  <br>  By the way, no date was given, thus 2012 is a hoax!|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	It is stated in Revelations that only God knows when the end of the world will occur. The physical world is not any more likely to end in 2012 than at any other point in time. This is not Christian doctrine in any way.<br>  <br>  The theory that the world will end in 2012 originated because of an ancient form of the Mayan calendar. This calendar, like the one we follow now, repeats itself after a set period of time. However, this Mayan calendar repeats only after very long intervals (many, many years). Some people have mistaken this process of repetition to be the end of the calendar altogether. And somehow this ending was correlated to the end of the world.<br>  <br>  It really has nothing to do with Christianity. There is no physical or spiritual Christian evidence to back up this theory.|`|7iFVbir1aa	1Thessalonians 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. <br>   1Th 4:15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive [and] remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. <br>   1Th 4:16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. <br>   1Th 4:17 Then we who are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. <br>   1Th 4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.|`|ClGfZ8PLaa	It is in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.  It is the Greek word "harpazo" which means to be "caught away". <br>  <br>  It is the removal of saved believers in Jesus from the earth, before the great tribulation.  The rapture is in the future, but Jesus says no man knows when.|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	The word rapture is not in the Bible. <br>  <br>  But here is how it happens<br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians4: 16For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: <br>  <br>     17Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.|`|2c7be5ea59e8bc81e9b25fcd49c0be76aa	The word itself does not appear in the Bible.  It is the teaching by primarily fundamentalist Christians that those Christians who are alive at the beginning, middle, or end of the tribulation period will be transformed (resurrected) and caught up to meet the Lord Jesus in the clouds. (1 Thess. 4:16-5:2; 2 Thess. 2)|`|AA10040075	I know when Jesus returns his servants who are dead will rise first. Then those servants who are alive will be caught up with them in the air. To meet him. And will forever be with him. <br>  The yr. 2012 is just a rumor. No one can back it up. No one can predict a day or hour when this will occur. Jesus said no one knows the day or hour except his father in heaven. But he knows the approximate time. He gave us signs to look for. So we would know how close it is. <br>  <br>  Actually Jesus was sent towards the (end of the world) to proclaim God is real and to make a way for us to have peace with him and how to get to heaven. He spoke of what he had seen and heard from God in heaven. God will not bring judgment without a fair enough warning. It was the last days (then) when he was on earth. A thousand yrs. is like one day to God. So if it was the last days then .How much closer it must be now. He kept warning as well as the apostles to watch, watch, watch. Because it will come when most are not expecting it. But those who know God and keep his commandments will know the time is at hand and will make many wise. But they can't even predict the day or hour.|`|6jHgscH8aa	Rapture is true it is not a rumor.And rapture will not take place in 2012.In the bible it is not written when rapture takes place ,the bible says that rapture will take place on the last day but did not tell us when.It can happen immediately,nobody knows when .Rapture is when  the last day comes,when the trumpet of GOD will sound,when the dead will come back to life and when our Lord jesus will come and takes us all i.e(for those who believe in him)to heaven.|`|PZp8wmRZaa	A lie.  It's not in the bible.  It's made up by 19 century evangelical Christians.|`|AA11631237	rapture is when god believers are taken up to heaven when Armageddon strikes|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The rapture as currently defined by fundies is a lie, and is not in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:37-39 “As in the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man be, for as in the days before the flood there were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, even until that day when Noah entered the ark.  They didn’t know until the flood came and took them away, so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.” <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:40-41  “Then (after that) two will be in the field and one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill and one will be taken and one will be left.”<br>  <br>  But wait a moment, Christ does not say that those taken will go up to heaven to be with Christ, and in fact He says just the opposite.  <br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians 2:16  “Then (after that) we who are alive, who are left, will be taken up together with them (the dead) in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so will be always with Him.”<br>  <br>  Apocalypse 18:7 “And it was given to him (Antichrist) power to make war with the saints and to overcome them.”<br>  <br>  Now I don’t know about you but I do not want to be raptured.  Let us look at what the Bible says.  It says that a rapture will take place at the moment of Christ’s appearing in the sky but it does not say where they go.  It does say that those who do not get raptured will be taken up into the air with Christ.  <br>  <br>  Now let’s look at what is taught from this by the saints.  Those left on earth after the great persecutions of the Antichrist, both good and bad, will see Christ coming in the clouds and with the wave of his hand, those going to hell will disappear (rapture) but those left will be lifted up body and soul into the clouds just before Christ destroys all creation. <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:29-31 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days, (days of the Antichrist)   the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars shall fall from the heavens and the powers of the heavens shall be moved.  And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven and all the tribes of the earth will morn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with much power and majesty and He will send his angels with a trumpet and a great voice and they will gather together His elect …” <br>  <br>  So you see that those who are left after the “rapture” will be taken up to be with Christ in the heavens. <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:21 “For there will be great tribulations, which have not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor will be after.  22 And unless those days were shortened no flesh would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 23 Then (after that) if any man say to you: “Lo there is Christ, or there, do not believe him.  For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.”<br>  <br>  Now read that again.  It says the greatest tribulations in the history of the world will come on all mankind, but it will not be the end of the world (for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened).  The elect will be here during the tribulations, and not raptured. <br>  <br>  I feel very sorry for those false teachers promoting a pre trib rapture.|`|8aYuUZneaa	It is when Jesus will come back to earth and take all the believers with Him up to heaven. ;)

Ultimately if God is the Creator then the full answer is only in Him of course, but there are the laws of science that He has made, mathematics, etc. IN fact the Christians have always referred to the 2 books of God, the Bible and Nature.<br>  <br>  You really must tell us what believing in yourself means because we know that God made us and so we are good.

As a rule, I hate humanity, it is not hard to find the flaws in us, and perhaps it is why so many people choose or are forced to believe in something that pretends to be better than us. All we are is stupid simians ruining everything we touch, so it makes sense for simians to seek a pretense of perfection in an unseen force that is just enough like us, but better.<br>   Putting power in a make believe character takes the power from one's own hands and it puts in in the hands of the few who control religion.

We also have friends(a couple) who come regularly for the week-end and they are Jehovah Witnesses.  We don't talk about religion and we have Crucifix in every room except the bathrooms LOL and they don't say anything.  My parents in law are in the Salvation Army and my husband' sister and husbands are Pastors for the Salvation Army(Captains I believe you call them) and when we visit them, we go to their Church(we have the same God).  Colour has nothing to do with anything, I look what is inside, the outside doesn't matter.  My cousin and his wife had two biological children and adopted 2 Chinese children, a girl and a boy and I think it's wonderful.  They didn't want their daughter to feel different when she would grow up so they decided to have a Chinese son too.  I wish I would have had the means, I would have loved to do the same.  We live in a small place with less than 1000 population and only have a few families of other ethnicity and nobody makes any difference.  I never met atheists before I started on Yahoo! Answers even though I had gone to the university.  In the little place where I live, not everybody is going to Church but they do believe in God.  Since I started on Yahoo! Answers, I met a lot of atheists who are very nice and we keep in touch.  Like in any group of people, whether they're believers or not, there are good and bad people.

VWtUhan3aa	Yes, very likely. The first dream I remember was of being in an enormous cathedral at mass. But instead of having pews it had seats like those at sports stadiums, and uncomfortable seats at that, and they were too close together. It was like being squished together with 20,000 people at a concert. So it was very crowded and uncomfortable and some ancient woman across the aisle kept murmuring to herself like she had dementia and I was getting very annoyed.<br>  <br>  Well, eventually the service was over and lunch was served, but instead of going off to some huge dining hall they served it to us right there in our cramped seats in styrofoam boxes. And in the boxes was some sort of chicken casserole or chicken quiche. But I'm not a big fan of chicken and it made me angry so I got up, went all the way down to the front and popped the priest right in the face with my leather jacket, just like popping someone with a towel. Everybody gasped and then I slung my styrofoam box of mystery chicken dish right into the choir. Instantly a major food fight and brawl erupted and everybody was slinging food, fighting and swearing. lol<br>  <br>  Then I dreamed I was helping to take Christmas lights off someone's roof and I broke most of the lights trying to detach the clips from the shingles. Then when I went into the house I had to climb a flight of stairs and at the top was a stained glass door. But no matter how hard I tried I couldn't open it, so I kicked it in and shattered it, only to then learn the double doors opened inward, not outward. Then I went outside and some kids out of school started throwing snow balls (even though there wasn't any snow) and so I began hurling rocks back and hit one of them in the head and knocked him out. And then found out it wasn't just some kid, but my cousin.<br>  <br>  Then I dreamed there was a flooding rain and I started finding all these helpless toad frogs, small birds and quail floundering in deep puddles, trying to stay afloat but drowning. So I rushed around as fast as I could to save them all, and did.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I remember dreaming is that I was lying on my bed (and in my dream I was awake) watching and listening to my ceiling fan and a Likki song on YouTube. Suddenly all the sounds faded away and a light appeared in the center of my bedroom and an American Indian boy appeared, dressed as he would have been back in the day. He had war paint on his face, like always (I've dreamed of him numerous times in the past) and, as usual, I wasn't sure of his age; anywhere from maybe 17 to 19. or so. He had black hair and eyes and after a moment he spoke, saying pretty much the same thing he's always said: "Do you know where you are? This is the place where angels die. This love will never die". Then he faded away and the sound of Likki and the ceiling fan resumed and I then woke up and just laid there for a while trying once again to determine what possible significance the dream could have, if any.<br>  <br>  Specific answers to your question: Yes, I would most likely be in trouble for popping the priest and causing a riot in church. Very likely be at least in some sort of trouble for beaming and wounding my cousin with a rock. Would probably be stuck paying for replacing the stained glass door. Would otherwise feel good about saving the toads and birds from drowning and, lastly, would, and do, feel dazed and strangely confused at my visitor and his message.<br>  <br>  Saint Omega|`|qMcTeBavaa	Probably not.

NOW, if it were say, a dozen or more then there would certainly be the beginning of a pattern in the making. However, having three such things makes this worth bearing watch over, and paying attention to more detail as the number of similarities occurs.

Lo primero es distinguir al pirómano patológico (que es un psicótico cualquiera que necesitará tratamiento psiquiatrico adecuado), del quema bosques mercenario al servicio de los pelotazos inmobiliarios de turno. Esta ultima clase es la más frecuente, (sobre todo en municipios donde gobierna la derecha).<br>  La solución es drástica pero simple. Quemar bosques es un crimen contra las personas, NO UN DELITO ECOLOGICO UNICAMENTE, si no se enfoca asi mal vamos. Y es un crimen contra las personas pues de seguir asi, el ser humano desaparecerá. No me importa cuando, desaparecerá y lo hará por culpa de las acciones presentes. Por tanto y considerado asi:<br>  <br>  1o.-Equiparar la quema intencionada de bosques a los delitos de asesinato, violación y terrorismo. Y por ello garantizar el cumplimiento integro de las penas.<br>  <br>  2o.-Equiparar en este delito a autor, inductor, colaborador necesario, y complices, por acción u omisión, y consecuentemente aplicarles la ley de la manera explicada arriba.<br>  <br>  3o.-Incautación de todos los bienes de los autores, inductores, colaboradores y complices descritos y de sus familias (estos ultimos de manera cautelar hasta determinar su procedencia). Con el producto de la subasta de estos bienes, proceder a la repoblación de lo quemado. Innecesario es aclarar que los montes quemados serían incautados sin derecho a compensación alguna.<br>  <br>  4o.-Investigación de las posibles responsabilidades de los politicos en los incendios, con las depuraciones a las que haya lugar. (Tarde ya para Marina D′Or o Terra Mítica, pero hay que empezar algún día). Y por supuesto información a la gente de todo ello.<br>  <br>  Asi quizá hariamos algo.|`|f6d7eda9052ab85bcfd79e0cb0a18d56aa	Normalmente el que quema un bosque lo hace por dos causas descuido o dinero. Al primero le obligaría a estar unos cuantos a?os repoblando. En el segundo caso buscaría al que le pagó, normalmente hay muchos intereses inmobiliarios detrás de un incendio y eso es muy triste. Al que prendió el fuego en este caso le obligaría a trabajar el resto de su vida repoblando, al que pago una fuerte sanción económica, unos a?itos de cárcel y una inhabilitación total para cualquier tema urbanístico.<br>  Ah!

In this sense, everyone under the law can marry if he/she is deemed eligible by the law; including atheists, gays, etc.<br>  It can also means holy covenant between a man, a woman, and God, to be united in one body ("till death do us part" thing). And it has thousands other definitions in beween.<br>  <br>  Different religions have different views too. i am Christian, so i can say even Christians have differences about this. Some churches allow gay marriage, others condemm it.<br>  <br>  For me, atheists have the right to marry, but their marriage is not for "religious use" because they don't believe in religions and any use of them. It is more for "Legal use", like getting spouse/children allowance, tax exemption, child protection, etc.<br>  In some countries, children from unwed parents can't even get their identities (legally) that they can't go to formal schools, hospitals, get driving licenses, have a passport, or open a bank account. Spouse from unwed couple cant get his/her inheritance should the other spouse pass away, even if the name is stated in the will, normally it will take more time & harder to process. There are many other legal benefits.<br>  <br>  Marriage is said to be a religious institution based on the religional believes. For Christians like me, it means marriage according to the Bible. Maybe you are familiar with the "jargon" already, ie:<br>  ...till death do us part: means no divorce<br>  between a man and a woman: means heretosexual monogamy<br>  etc<br>  <br>  GBU|`|AA11225745	Yes, I honor marriage, God honors marriage, it is not a "religious institution", read the Bible God is not "religion" He is all about love: here some of the things He says about marriage:<br>  <br>  Hebrews 13 4:4 Marriage should be honored by ALL, and the marriage bed kept pure<br>  <br>  Proverbs 18:22 He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the LORD.<br>  <br>  "A religious institution" Christianity is the way of life a relationship and fellowship with Jesus.

NwXnzARwaa	There is not a single gay gene, but being gay has been linked to several genes.<br>  <br>  Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."<br>  <br>  New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."<br>  <br>  LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."<br>  <br>  Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."<br>  <br>  WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Dr. Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, has said that some people who have twisted his words to suggest that homosexuality is not genetic have taken words out of context that have "all come from the Appendix to my book “The Language of God” (pp. 260-263), but have been juxtaposed in a way that suggests a somewhat different conclusion that I intended. I would urge anyone who is concerned about the meaning to refer back to the original text. The evidence we have at present strongly supports the proposition that there are hereditary factors in male homosexuality." & "No one has yet identified an actual gene that contributes to the hereditary component... but it is likely that such genes will be found in the next few years."|`|AA11589320	The sooner they identify this gene the better as it will also allow the changing of a heterosexual guy gay.

A bit like one person is tolerant and understanding while another is short fused and non caring or while one guy will enter into business and become a new Bill Gates while another will fail.   <br>  <br>  If we allow this to be put down to our Genes we open up the gates to hell as every single person in jail will be able to claim he was disadvantaged by "Mother Natures Criminal Gene.

PS6Pjtndaa	The two most abused bits of scripture ever are:<br>  <br>  1. Don't judge people and<br>  2. It's wrong to kill<br>  <br>  The second one is traceable in part to the King James version of the Bible which incorrectly interpreted the word murder as kill.  So, instead of saying: Thou shall not murder, it said instead, Thou shall not kill.  So, every peacenik and pacifist on the planet has seized upon that verse and calls us hypocrits.  The funny thing is that we've explained the misinterpration about a billion times and they keep saying, "Thou shall not kill."  Are they dense or just wanting their way, despite the evidence against them?<br>  <br>  Now, don't judge.  Let's say I'm walking along and I see a guy pull out a gun and for no reason just open fire in a crowed store.  He kills three people and injures 10 others.  That night on the news you see me being interviewed.  I say, "It's absolutely wrong what this man did!  That is a heinous crime and a terrible sin in God's eyes."<br>  <br>  You tell me, are you going to shout at me: "Don't judge him"?  We play this game with judgement.  It's USUALLY applied to gays.  "Don't judge me."  And to some degree to all sexual immorality.  "Don't judge me."  Again, it's been explained to you all about a billion times now, but we'll go for a billion and one. <br>  <br>  GOD SAYS that certain actions are sins.  So, if you witness those actions or know about them then it's simply stating a fact to say, "That's a sin."  So, saying homosexuality or fornication or murder are sins is NOT judging people, it's stating Biblical facts!<br>  <br>  The judgement is far more complicated.  It's like feeling "good" about yourself that you are gay.  My, aren't I great in my own sight for not being an evil homosexual?  THAT'S judging!  "Look at me world, I'm not a killer!  Woo hoo!"  THAT'S judging!<br>  <br>  So, I had a little trouble answering your question, because I do see that so often misunderstood, but your right!  It's like I was in some stupid training seminar once and the facilitator was babbling about how "threatening" YOU speech is.  She said that when counselling employees, don't say YOU were late or YOU aren't working very hard, because the YOU sounds accussatory.  <br>  <br>  I said, "WAIT A MINUTE!"  If YOU in and of itself is some hot-button word that automatically puts people on the defensive then what about YOU are wonderful, YOU are my best employee, and so on?  I pointed out that it's not the YOU that's the problem, it's what follows it.  As you point out, it's not that we place value judgements on people.  My kids eat up the value judgements where they are wonderful, but when they mess up ... oh man, daddy is mean!<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Read John 7:24 and 1 Corinthians 2:15|`|A01w1dHqaa	This can be sticky, too. When you differentiate people into good you can automatically assume there is a bad. We are all children of God with infinite potential. For a child to want to be good so he won't feel he is bad doesn't let him escape judgment and guilt. It's a skill to reflect to a person his improvement  or an area to correct when he is receptive instead of his label or characterization.|`|vSlG3ayiaa	Because nobody is against ALL judging.  In fact, it would be terribly negligent if we never judged.  If you're going to hire a baby sitter or get married, you certainly ought to make judgments about people.  You wouldn't want to just hire or marry anybody.|`|RF1jX2ZVaa	A compliment is not a judgment. If we say someone is beautiful that could mean not just the physical person but the person of the heart that we know personally. But when we make a judgment to a persons mistakes he makes then we are acting like God. Matthew chapter 7 talks about this in principle with our brothers and sisters in the congregation of churches we choose to go to. The greatest commandment is to love one another. John 13:35 <br>   Through out the bible Christian men and women give compliments to each others character. They are not judging each other. <br>  When we are judged negatively for our mistakes this helps us take notice and evaluate the situation and look to improve. Jesus had to instruct the apostles about sleeping when they should have been alert to :keep on the watch: Jesus talked to Peter and told him he would deny him three times. Peter did this and wept bitterly later.<br>   Each one will carry his own load the bible says. Galatians 6:5 So we need to be encouraging to one another. Leave the judging up to God.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	That is more a compliment not a judgment<br>  <br>  Judgment:  to form an estimate or evaluation of  ; especially : to form a negative opinion about <br>  <br>  Have a happy day!<br>  <br>  Cinn =)|`|WL7nKDplaa	I agree with Footy. People like to hear good things. People don't like to hear bad things. Simple, easy. Life is hard enough without people saying mean things, but the nice things can brighten your day.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Compliments aren't judging.  Saying things to people to make themselves feel small and yourself feeling superior is judging.|`|zc47c39daa	I see where you're coming from and this is quite an interesting topic now that it's been brought to my attention.<br>  <br>  I believe that the brain sends out a signal when we hear negative judgments, such as, "You're ugly!" and it activates our emotions, which control situations more often than not. We don't want to hear negative comments, but we are brought up to thank others for compliments- positive judgments.<br>  <br>  It's all a matter of emotions. Just how like emotions and humanity determined the Constitution. When we say 'don't judge'- it can be interpreted in a few different ways, but I guess the most common one would be stereotypes and negative judgments- other than that positive compliments are practically begged for in our day and age. :)<br>  <br>  Very interesting question!|`|xkXCFpCMaa	Because its okay to comment in a positvie because then were recognising thast tier view has some credibility, which every view does in its own way, so in doing this we are respecting thier right ito uphold what they think. we only shouldnt judge when were dismissing a person for thier views- because everyone is entitled to thier own views. Althuogh it covers also that we shuoldnt judge in praising one view to be above others, because everything is relative to each person.|`|LWvh2g2maa	A judgement is a form of critical opinion.  A compliment is an admiring remark.  They are not one in the same.  Therefore, do not judge.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	we are to use Judgment but not to be judgmental.we need to make Judgments in our lives but not act like we are the Ultimate authority|`|8aW6f0Byaa	Why does it have to be so difficult?

God is sinless so he can judge!|`|AA12382198	That's not judging......that's giving a compliment.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	Well blue, there are different levels of judgment. In all things there are always levels. At one level there is a carnal judgments, where one judges things they do not understand, as they are doing what is called projecting. A higher level would be righteous judgment, this is one who judges in knowledge, because they know. <br>  <br>  Discernment is important, or we would fall for everything. For instance, say you wanted to go out with a guy. You do not know him, your knowledge of him doesn't go beyond the surface. He looks good to you, but you do not know how he is within. So you talk to him and observe his manifestations, to get a bigger picture of him, to see if this person is even safe to be around. This is a lesser level of discernment and it is important. One has to develop the capacity to discern things, in order to tell one thing from the other. <br>  <br>  One of the problems with judgments is seen in the fact that most people condemn in others natures and aspects they possess themselves and often they are just projecting their shortcomings unto others. And they do this because they can't see their own issues and defects. If one judges in a more conscious manner, they will do so through compassion. They will be able to empathize with the individual, by seeing in themselves a similar problem. And then they can perhaps help them. Most time people judge its all them projecting and it isn't to help anyone.
gG09T0Cnaa	There is nothing wrong with peeing in a bucket and then emptying it later. People did that all the time back before plumbing when they didn't want to go outside to the outhouse in the cold of night. We do that in our camper when we're camping and don't want to walk to the bathrooms in the night. I've also peed in the kitchen sink when I couldn't hold it in and the toilet was being used.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	I think that I peed in the bath when I was a kid because I didn't want to get out, and most people have probably peed in a swimming pool or two in their time, at least when they were kids, but what you are talking about is gross gross gross. Why not just pee out of the window, or buy a chemical toilet?|`|S7ciZHDeaa	i dont but i have a friend that does<br>  one day after a party we were walking home<br>  and we walked by a house that was teepeed <br>  and she had to pee so she takes off her pants, pees on the some random persons lawn and takes the paper from the teepee and uses it haha|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I've peed in pools and the ocean and out in the woods while hiking but that's it; I never heard of any apt without a toilet!|`|jcL7gDMKaa	haha yeah i've peed in the bath on the odd occaision when I couldnt be bothered to get out if it.

Put it this way, let say a 24 or even a 30 year old was sleeping with a 16 year old, that would be wrong and the 30 year old definitely deserves to go to jail, but it's not pedophilia, it's statutory rape, the 30 year is a creep and taking advantage and all that, but the younger person isn't a child, just not old enough or mature enough to be having a relationship with someone that much older|`|nC9TGrfGaa	No, it's just two years difference. He's pretty much a teenager himself. <br>  <br>  A pedophile is an adult attracted to CHILDREN, who haven't went through puberty yet.|`|VoQN7ADvaa	Nah; pedophilia is typically supposed to be at least 7 years younger or something like that if the person happens to be underage. 16 is age of consent.|`|zCZGmSvWaa	no way, it's just 2 years... <br>  But shame on those two, because of hte cheating.|`|AA11540967	16 is legal. ( At least it is in Michigan where I live ) So he is not a Pedophile.|`|WRSNIusaaa	Paedophilia begins at ... i think around 12. I'm talking about Australian law, but i'm sure it's not that different. The victims of paedophilia have to be below a certain age (again, around 12), so no, he wouldn't. and i wouldn't go around telling people that he is either because that is actually illegal and very damaging to a person's reputation (regardless of how much of a dick he is already).<br>  <br>  If she's under the legal age for sex in California, it's statutory rape, where she consents but he gets in trouble because 'he should know better' or something.

Terrorism is more than just blowing up cars and buildings. Terrorism is creating terror. Religion has so much terror in it: fear of Hell, wrath of God, etc. and all (well not all but a lot of religions) have installed this fear into people in order to make them believe. So make sure you understand what they mean when they say terrorists. As for the pushing beliefs on people, oh yeah it happens. You haven't seen it because you are religious but for someone like me who is not religious it happens a lot. I asked a question about the Bible on here (just about a clarification and I also included that I did not take the Bible as fact and someone actually emailed me a link to a religious group saying that I would really benefit from this. I never asked for info on how to be religious..

Most of the time when I see people only dedicated to their own ideals it just reminds me how fanatical people can be and to be careful not to make the same mistake with mine.|`|AA11690436	Yes, and frankly, it also makes me feel as though I'm a little too easily swayed.  When I'm reading an answer from Mama Pajama or Paperback, my Jewish roots come rushing to the forefront.  On the other hand, when I look at answers from you or other pantheists, my insistence that the totality of the universe and "God" are one and the same pushes to forth.  Fortunately, I don't think the two are necessarily mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  I will say, however, as I swing between those two, responses from Christians usually will distance me from my former fascination with the archetypal redemption myth that Jesus represents.  I have to remind myself of the value a William Blake or Dostoevsky found in deconstructing (and reconstructing) that potent force in the history of Western Civ.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Seeing "truly" spiritual people (whatever that means to them) is inspiring to me.

For instance, i am a protestant christian, but each time i see muslims, stop and pray five times a day, wherever they are, i feel inspired to be closer to God|`|sohnrZDcaa	Not really... I dropped out of Christianity and religion in general when I realized that the Bible was written by a bunch of wanking perverts!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created the story of the Jewish God that is worshipped by gullible Christians today mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in times of famine. Not even as an option, but as the “WILL OF GOD!” God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God won’t let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES! The Preachers always cover up anything negative about the Bible God! I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! ANY preacher today has to be very dishonest not to admit any of these facts! The Bible was written to control low IQ religious people who need to pay a 10% (TITHE) crutch to function in this world. Any religion back then was as barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... Rather recently America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure after the collapse of the US gold monetary system! <br>  <br>  This Bible God is totally powerless to teach any lesson without FORCING the Jews to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Palestine was a “Land Flowing with Milk and Honey” ONLY before the Israelite invasion. The former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the invasion SURPRISE!!! suddenly the “milk and honey” stopped flowing! So now the Bible writers are promising to Israel that “God will make the desert to blossom like a rose!” The perennial carrot hanging at the end of the stick is working!<br>  <br>  God’s sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be imagined! None of the “Godless” dictators in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! That is so repulsive that no smut publication is publishing anything like that either, but any pervert preacher can discreetly enjoy reading all about it in the Holy Bible! The rest of Christians are totally brainwashed with the GOD IS LOVE bit! No wonder the Clergy hid the Bible from public view for so many centuries! To their great relief hardly any Christian today pays attention to what they read in the Bible! <br>  <br>  Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians are trained to believe that no matter how pervert it may sound “if God says it I believe it… and that settles it!”)<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*God is conditioning the mind of the Israelites 700 Bible years into the future! In our society today anybody promoting the idea of any crime like that is put in jail!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your God has given you* (*God WILL NOT do anything to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them…! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus… Amen?) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating…* (*according to the Bible writers, not sharing is “THE SIN”! Only religious perverts can dream on feeding on their own children for ever!)<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 19:9 I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (This sick God has to FORCE the Jews to eat their own children! During the real historic Roman siege of “Masada” [do Google] all the Jewish families killed themselves before even dreaming about eating their own children!)<br>  <br>  God won’t force the Jews to eat PIGS, but their own children YES! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians won’t be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will the heart bleeding Christians of the Westboro orientation eat their own children for dinner? Christians would deny it or say that if God forced the Jews to do it, it was because they were very “sinful”!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...<br>  <br>  Any secular government would offer its citizens better protection than the Bible God. They would certainly allow them to eat pork instead of children! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Land of Palestine that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)! Actually that was just another trick in the Bible script to motivate well fed Jews into COVETING* (*the heck with the 10 Commands!) to leave Egypt and to invade the Holy Land. (BTW, there is not a shred of historical evidence that millions of slave Jews ever lived in Egypt or that they ever ate their children!) Now the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for God’s kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and some freaky Bible readers today!<br>  <br>  Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN…! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but “MANY” God loving heterosexual ladies) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...!<br>  <br>  Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT in the Bible that is IMPOSSIBLE for any Preacher to “spiritualize” and make it go away!<br>  <br>  2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)!” The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, “What's the matter?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.’ So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW… it came out delicious!!!). The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him, but she had hidden him!* (*God cursed woman! She cheated!) <br>  <br>  They were all COMPASSIONATE Godly, non-Atheistic, heterosexual women that HAVE SLAUGHTERED AND COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR DINNER at the tune of “The LORD is my Shepherd I shall not want” (Psa 23)!<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15 “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I* (*God) WILL NOT FORGET YOU!* (*I’ll make her eat the child! Hey, not even Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is that scary! God must have a serious psychopathic disorder and ought to see a shrink!)<br>  <br>  The last bunch of Bible writers claim that God the Son Jesus Christ was beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit to become the dignified “Lamb of God” grotesquely nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross. The Romans never dressed the genitals of their victims with a diaper! The Christians need to snack his ROMAN SPIT FLAVORED MEAT AND DRINK HIS HOLY BLOOD to go to Heaven when they die! (John 6:53) The eating of children is part of the BIBLE tale so the forever snacking on the Jesus Christ in the Holy Communion is not half that bad!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that God’s enemies ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?) <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, HAPPY is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Holy Vendetta! The heck with “giving the other cheek!”) --he who seizes your infants and DASHES them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  Needed abortions today are for HUMANE reasons! Only the fetus is destroyed not a born child! According to the Bible God requires that the children be dashed to pieces or slaughters and cooked for dinner after they are born! God’s Chosen People (Israel – Christians claim to be the “spiritual Israel” today) will ravish some horny ladies while DASHING THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST THE ROCKS – PRAISE THE LORD Sweet Jesus! <br>  <br>  Isaiah 13:16 (KJV) Their little ones also WILL BE DASHED TO PIECES before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished…. (the wanking Bible writers claim that some ladies of God’s enemies will be ravished to their delight while their children are being DASHED TO PIECES – GOD IS CONDITIONING THE MIND OF HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE FOR THIS SORT OF DEPRAVITY!)<br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ is hardly any better than his Daddy God!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (In his apocalyptic “revelation” Jesus Christ says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies --not destroying fetuses, but killing children! God the Father forced Israel to eat their children for dinner now God the Son Jesus Christ promised to kill the children in the wrong Churches so they can learn a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS. To add insult to injury, preachers are getting rich selling books on Jesus’ love for the little children of the world! Today, Jesus Christ would be in jail for bullying about killing any child to favor a particular brand of faith!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia talks like that in public!)<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that the Bible was written by a bunch of wanking perverts and Christians are brainwashed to disregard all the crap in it! They hardly read the whole Bible anyway!|`|f6MvpLgkaa	this is my opion sorry if it offends but i dont believe in god i believe in Evolution.|`|cXXSfRttaa	Sometimes.

NBXY35zPaa	I do believe in ghosts... I've had my share of experiences, I mean it's always hard to convince people, but only you would know. However, I'm always skeptic because well, about 80% of the time it can be logically explained and it's NOT a ghost. That picture is not a ghost, it's reflection from water. I'm not doubting that your house is haunted, but that picture isn't evidence. Sometimes (although it's weird), you might have to communicate with it and get your point across... Tell it to stop trying to scare you because you're not going anywhere.|`|lVIdENvqaa	It's not haunted. You have been watching too many spook shows.<br>  When a person dies, he goes up or down, but not into someones house.<br>  Older houses make noises when they settle, wind makes noise when it blows through certain objects. Cars, Streetlights and reflections from other sources of light can be seen for miles and love to reflect off walls in your house.<br>  There is always an explanation. You just need to try to figure it out.|`|WwUYKOtUaa	that picture is clearly water in the fish tank making shapes.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Could be you have alot of wires in some room pumping out TONS of what they call EMF fields which can make all of that seem real. If your worried contact TAPS they are serious and not a joke like some others. And yes I do belive.<br>  <br>  BTW are you sure its not the tick of the flash from the camera and your mind. Not being mean just giving you an option to dismiss this idea is all.<br>  <br>  Edit: I made a mistake EMF is not what I ment it to be thats a whole nother subject. What Im talking about is a group of wires that can give off so much energy they create whats called a Fear Cage that leads to sensetivity, skin rashes, headaches, the feeling of being watched or touched.|`|0SOwJAuWaa	It ghosts? There's a proper word for that; hermaphordite. You don't say "it", that's just rude.|`|AK7qoYP8aa	well that picture does not look anything like a ghost, but yes i do believe in ghosts and i think that u might have them|`|k9gp11PMaa	I'm a 110% believeR!|`|khdFNlJ7aa	I believe in ghosts, or something. I have seen something, I can't say if it was a ghost , but maybe some kind of entity of some sorts. I don't assume things if I don't know for sure. I don't know for sure what it was, and it didn't out and out say  "I AM A GHOST' or demon, or whatever it was.

ob9oJpKbaa	In what sort of position would you need to cut your hair?! That doesn't make sense to me at all. In Australia, its against the law to discriminate against looks- that includes hair. If your hair is too long and you are working with machinery or something, they should just require you to tie it back. Btw, that lady sounds like a *****!
Bfd9Osw4aa	No it's not. You should however consider marital counseling, and perhaps take a Financial Peace University class to help you both out on the subject. Marital counseling isn't bad- To tell you the truth, almost any couple can go to counseling and figure things out that they didn't think were bad anf come out stronger.  Finances are the #3 thing that most people divorce over, so this is not an uncommon thing.  Remember that marriage is a redemptive relationship, and that it's supposed to look like Christ's relationship with the church. Do you think that Jesus has to put up with us (the church) about money? yeah, of course he does, when there are Christians who are starving and other Christians are buying brand new SUV's. Does God divorce us?|`|xelkbdbdaa	Stand your ground. Take back the rightful and Scriptural control of the home like the bible says. The man is to be the leader of the household. The modern ways are not all good. She may be in control in more ways than you are describing. If she really takes you to task over this, then I would look at divorce as a last resort. You've got to handle this lovingly. But, you've got to show her that you're taking control for the good of both of you. It is not wise to let a woman have complete control over all things. Surely, she is not taking your thoughts on the matter into account, based on what you are saying. Take a stand for yourself and her. If she doesn't like that, too bad.|`|gf3CCvuUaa	No, and never.<br>  <br>  Your belief that she will never submit to you is the one that must change.<br>  And her bossy behavior is also the one that must change.<br>  <br>  Go to marriage counselor instead of a lawyer. You'll surely find your answer if the two of you can be open minded. Hopefully soon enough.<br>  <br>  Take care and good luck.|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	She 'insists'?

gvtjyrsBaa	I think you're onto something. It's about power and control. <br>  <br>  The people who have power and control want to keep it. However, they are a small minority, so they need to manipulate the system in order to maintain their privileged position. <br>  <br>  If the majority were ever to unite and rise up against them, they would be powerless. So they spend enormous amounts of energy to keep us divided and squabbling among ourselves--so that we don't notice who the REAL adversary is.<br>  <br>  One divisive issue is gay marriage. Now, the rich, powerful people--whether they're gay or straight--don't care one way or another if their marriages are legal. They'll always have job and housing security, health care and hospital visitation rights. Nobody is going to take their children away. <br>  <br>  It's the rest of us who need constitutional equality to protect our rights and our families.|`|V4jYQcJZaa	I think it's because people want to keep "traditional" marriage.

It is possible to be an atheist Jew opposed to the actions in Gazza!|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Antisemitism is something I've never understood. If a Lutheran did something you did not like, would all Lutherans be considered bad, or dishonest or whatever? <br>  <br>  Some antisemitism actually is tied into Christian teachings and almost folklore. Even today, and especially maybe into the mid 20th century, there were a lot of people who said "the Jews crucified Christ" when it was a handful in Jerusalem at the Temple who conspired against him. And Jesus forgave those who crucified him, so I don't know why that would have made a difference.<br>  <br>  Currently many people are upset by the bombing of Gaza. The fact Israel is defending their country and/or is committing atrocities against civilians has nothing to do with the fact they are Jewish. All countries defend themselves and all wars involve civilian casualties, I'm not defending it, it just happens. <br>  <br>  Most people who say antisemitic things have no problem watching TV shows or movies starring or produced by Jewish people. It's like racists who have no trouble watching sports or listening to music dominated by African Americans.

Tell them how to live, who to love and the difference between right and wrong, when they themselves haven't got a clue.

About straight couples that cannot have or chose to have children-  marriage is not just for creating babies, you know?|`|v1zyfea5aa	First, there is no place in the constitution where it ever says separation of church and state.  This is a liberal lie.  The words were first used by Jefferson in a letter to the Baptists at Danbury Connecticut Jan 1 1802. (years after the First amendment guaranteed free exercise of religion.<br>   <br>  Second, since marriage is a sacrament of the R. Catholic church, the state has no right to limit the free exercise thereof. They should neither tax, nor license it.  That violates  the free exercise clause.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, your argument breaks down in that people have rights to vote for the kind of society they choose to live in.  Check the first paragraph of the Declaration (I know they don't teach that in California because an Engineer who lived with us this past summer who was a product of the Cal. School systems and universities didn't know what Independence day was.)<br>  <br>  Fourth, in reference to thirdly, your presumption would mean people should not vote against murder, theft, harmful drugs, and the list goes on and on.

24H5tznkaa	I created a spell a long time ago that was called "Banishing Past Pain"<br>  <br>  All you need is a bowl, a white candle and some water. Of course, if you cast circles during ritual and spellwork you will need other things. <br>  <br>  You take the candle and light it and then let the melted wax drip from it and into the center of the bowl. You just need enough melted wax so that you can stand the candle up in the middle of the bowl. Once you have done that, you pour fresh water into the bowl. <br>  <br>  Then you meditate on your past. What is bothering you about it? What are you holding on to? Is it making you angry? Is it making you sad? <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, either talk about it out loud, directing it to the candle, mentally think towards the candle or cry, yell, scream...whatever it is, let it out and give it to the candle. <br>  <br>  The candle will absorb it and as it burns, the emotions that you have tied into the past will go into the water.<br>  <br>  When you feel you are done, put out the candle (close your circle if applicable) and pour the water into the toilet and flush it. See your unhealthy ties to the past being disposed of. <br>  <br>  You may need to do this more than once but you will feel the results the first time around. <br>  <br>  Additionally, trying something you have never done before...something you have always wanted to do, is a good way to root you firmly in the present. Since what you are doing has never been done in your past, it is giving you a moments reprieve from being tied to it.|`|hmsMpECkaa	You nor anybody else cannot stop living in the past.  It only takes a heartbeat to make the past.  After the first heartbeat everything else is past because you cannot stop the heart beating.  How many times has your heart beat in the past?  72 times a minute; 4320 times an hour;  103,680 times a day, and that is the past. <br>  For even a pagan, the life is in the blood.  And the blood circulates completely every 8 minutes or so and it goes through again.  Your body is made up of the past.  What you ate, what you drank, and really everybody does the same thing they did yesterday with a little twist every now and again and they build on the past and make the past bigger.  But, that doesn't answer your question.<br>  How do you stop living in the past?  There must be a way!  Let me see, Easter is coming up and Daylight Savings Time is coming up and everything else is . . . coming up.  <br>  Turn around!  Give your heart something to make it beat better and more efficiently and give you life, your blood, a good cleaning. That way, you can be charged for Easter, like the Everready Battery Bunny; it just keeps goin' and goin' . . .|`|FxAD44Moaa	just don't...    there's so much future.. how can you find the time this day and age to hold onto the past so much?<br>  <br>  it's not just a pagan issue.. but all creeds and genders.. ya know.. the past to some is so hard to let go.. because of many reasons and one is..<br>  <br>  so many unanswered questions are in one's past... and we feel incomplete because of that lack of closure.<br>  <br>  <br>  among other things.. i have that problem also.. but i'm more present tense now than i've ever been.. i guess i got tired of all that hard work trying to make  peace with my past.<br>  <br>  don't feel bad..  you're not alone!  this is so normal.. so human!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  just take your time working things out, when you are ready,  you will move on.. no matter your reasoning.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Dedicate your life to the Goddess.

VncSMLMpaa	The wisdom the LORD God wishes us to have is the knowledge of Him and His ways and His plan and purpose with us and the world.<br>  <br>  Jesus was given that wisdom by His Father through the thorough reading and understanding of his Father's word. Because Jesus knew the Scriptures so well, as was demonstrated at the age of twelve when he stayed behind at the Temple reasoning with the Jewish elders. He used his thirty years well before his ministry began.<br>  <br>  Jesus said that if people had known Moses, David and the prophets they would have known him. How true.|`|smA22aNHaa	Wisdom is having knowledge and knowing how to use it.|`|AA11399548	Jesus was the author of wisdom. He is God Incarnate. Everything He did and does is wise.

You can never get wisdom sitting within the four walls of the church. Jesus wisdom came when he was out there being tempted by the devil and over coming what ever the devil passed his way.<br>  I'm not saying go out and look for things to come, but you can get the wisdom by learning from other people errors. If you go out and talk to homeless people, they have more wisdom than a lot of people, because they have seen and been through a lot. I ought to know, I was one of them. This is why the bible says, count it all joy when facing many trials and tribulations. You gain wisdom by learning. Experience. A lot of people within the four walls have knowledge, but they are so stuck within the four walls of the church, that they have little wisdom at all.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	There is just so much wrong with this line of unreasoned thought.|`|YvvnTrxDaa	Well because he created it as the Son part of the God head.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Q---What is "Wisdom"?<br>  A---It means to have respect and reverence for God and to feel in awe of his majesty and power.

Its just a question about Jesus and doesn't matter if you believe or not. And there are a lot worse people to imitate other than Jesus!<br>  <br>  I think wisdom is about making the right decisions in life from a unselfish point of view. But even Jesus sometimes made the wrong decisions and wasn't totally abundant in wisdom. And maybe more human for it. Believe in yourself as well as Jesus and learn from the mistakes you make in life and be true to yourself, like Jesus did.|`|wNJetCLEaa	Wisdom is an understanding and abundance of knowledge.  Jesus knew and understood all of the mysteries of the universe so that's why he possessed it.  He demonstrated wisdom with every quote of his in the bible and we can "imitate" it by taking those quotes to heart.  The thing is- your wisdom is your own and his is his.  God's wisdom far transcends that of human comprehension so you might as well just allow yourself to grow wise on your own terms.|`|e7SYtaIJaa	Dont be so naive as to think that a.

I've just searched for "wisdom" in the bible, and amongst the verses that came up are the following... <br>  <br>  Proverbs 9:10 (NIV)  <br>      "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,<br>          and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. <br>  <br>  Proverbs 4:11 (NIV)  <br>      I guide you in the way of wisdom<br>          and lead you along straight paths. <br>  <br>  James 1:5 (NIV)  <br>      If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <br>  <br>  I think wisdom is knowing God, and that also leads to knowing people too, because God loves people. Jesus grew in wisdom by being faithful and obedient...<br>  <br>  Luke 2:51-52 (NIV)  <br>      Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. [52] And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. <br>  <br>  <br>  Proverbs and also Bill Hybels book "Making Life work" amongst many others are good places to start looking for wisdom. <br>  <br>  I'm looking forwards to reading other answers :) God bless X|`|PgWkqjeZaa	This one will bake your noodle... It's a paraphrase though... :)<br>  <br>  Jesus was sinless and did not inherit the fallen state with all of the attributes associated with that... foolishness, worldly outloook, zits, what have you... <br>  <br>  Since Christ was perfect, he was able to perfectly assume the best traits of the human condition and avoid those of the fallen condition.

I think I'd suggest that my friend revisit the Catholic teaching on homosexuality. I would suggest that he read the Catechism, if he wants to know what the Church teaches on homosexuality.<br>  <br>  The Church does say that having same-sex attraction is not a sin, but acting on it, either physically, or mentally (such as fantasizing) is sinful and intrinsically disordered. The reasons are that the Church rightly teaches that sex is unitive and procreative. Remove either aspect and the sex act becomes less than what God designed. Because persons of the same sex can never have procreative sex, their sex act is always disordered. <br>  <br>  This is the teaching of the Church.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	It is not surprising that you may infact know more about Catholicism than your "Cafeteria Catholic" (lol dynamite term I've never heard before hope you don't mind if I use it) friend.

My advice tell him to google "Catechism of the Catholic Church" do a key word search on your topic question and challenge him to either "get on board" theologically or at least admit that he is lapsed.|`|MiAOnwN6aa	The Church does forbid homosexual acts; so as you say, he seems to be Catholic in name only. However, the tendency to homosexuality is not condemned in itself. Celibacy is required just as for unmarried straight folks. Confession is also available for any violations. Priests  are not allowed to refuse absolution for homosexual acts which may or may not have some extenuating circumstances.|`|AA10920670	I think you should invest some time in reading the Catechism. And leave your friend alone.<br>  <br>  2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.|`|8926e7a0edf41e779e48b2c85ae561a2aa	Tell him to read the Bible.

Good luck.|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Really, if you go deep into Catholic Theology, nobody can live up to th Chruch's expectations. In the writings of many saints, they express concern that no matter what they do, they cant live the perfect, sinless life. This is made most famouse by St. Augusine when he wrote, "May God grant me chastety, just not yet." In Catholic, the very nature of mankind is sinful, and God has mercy upon our sins. We all fail in some way to live up to God's expectations, yet we are forgiven. Much like a child can never fully live up to his/her parents expectation. But, the love the child anyway.<br>  <br>  As with sexuality, the Catholic Church has nothing wrong with homosexuality as an act. Follow my reasoning. The Catholic Chruch is againist ALL sexuality that doesn't have the intention of creating a child. Obviously homosexuality fits this category, but so does sex between a man and a woman with birth control. Both are equally sinful in the Catholic Chruch. <br>  <br>  Obviously, if you have ever been to Brazil and Italy, many devout Catholic fall under this sin. But, Catholic theology isn't about damning people for their sins, but giving them a way to attone and rise above their sins. Thats the sacraments. <br>  <br>  I am a practicing Catholic. I argee with almost all Church teaching, including it's ideas on sexuality, yet I have a protected physical relationship with my beloved girlfriend. My sins are the same as your friends. But I agree with the Church's point of view on sexuality because they represent an IDEAL. The Church, with the teachings of Christ, is calling me to be a perfect person. In some ways I rise to the occasion, in many ways, I fail.But I always try to become better and more pious. Now, many would call me a "cafeteria" catholic, and I guess I would submit to their judgement. But I know full well that they fail to live up to the callings of Christ, just like me, but I refuse to cast the first stone at them. Catholicism is not about sin, its about conquring our sins with Christ's mercy.

We are all different and it is in this contentious world that we need an Intercessor to find and allow us common ground to understand and really, love each other. <br>  The story of the Bible, the point of the Bible is God telling us HOW to develop His kingdom here on earth. <br>  THink about it. If everyone acted like Jesus showing compassion for everyone and rejecting evil - this would, in fact, be heaven on earth. This was the point of the Lord's Prayer. <br>  Where is heaven and where is hell? <br>  It's right here! This is where the Garden of Eden started out and we, as humans, corrupted it so that we can no longer enter into it.

So though the tetragrammaton ???? (YHWH) was inscribed over 8000 times in early copies of scriptures, these were later removed, effectively removing the name of God from the holy scriptures.<br>  God, LORD are titles not personal names. Jehovah's Witnesses have in the New World Translation restored the name of God as Jehovah (Psalms 83:18 KJV) which is the English rendering of YHWH from the meaning, "He that causes to become" back into it's rightful place. <br>  Complete copies of the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures) existing today date from as far back as the fourth century?C.E. Such manuscripts and later copies do not contain the divine name, Jehovah, represented in Hebrew by the Tetragrammaton (YHWH).<br>  These copies have substituted the Greek words for “God” and “Lord” wherever the Tetragrammaton occurred in the Hebrew text. However, a discovery in Palestine some 50 years ago shed light on this matter. A team exploring caves near the west shore of the Dead Sea uncovered fragments from an ancient leather scroll of the 12 prophets (Hosea through Malachi) written in Greek. These writings were dated between 50?B.C.E. and 50?C.E. In these earlier fragments, the Tetragrammaton had not been replaced by the Greek words for “God” and “Lord.” Hence, the use of the divine name in the early Septuagint version of the Scriptures was confirmed.<br>  <br>  As of unintentional sins no we are not judged guilty though true Christians still ask Jehovah for forgiveness of daily sins.<br>  <br>  Psalm 19:13 <br>  Mistakes—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent.?<br>  <br>  However....<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:26<br>  For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left.?.?.|`|I1BlNBAaaa	I don't think they even know the name they are just making it up as they go along, kind of like a fairy tale to teach children things so they will learn certain lessons.

I have four thoughts on it:<br>  <br>  1. Although there are some Orthodox Christians in America and Western Europe, they form a very small minority. So Orthodox Christianity is considered exotic. If we were in Eastern Europe, it would be the opposite. <br>  <br>  2. You are right that Orthodox Christianity has a rich history, but that is just it: it is a history that developed on its own, separated from the history of Catholicism and Protestantism. In a way, it is arguably its own thing.<br>  <br>  3. The truth, however, is that this is just one more example of a big fact that MOST Christians (and many non-Christians) ignore: Christianity is simply not a unified system of belief. It is an amalgamation of many beliefs that have a few common overlaps and origins. <br>  <br>  4. But there is nothing wrong with that. That is one thing that makes Christianity great: it has the diversity and flexibility to serve many different populations under many different circumstances. It is kind of ironic that so many accuse Christianity as a whole as being inflexible. The reality suggests that this simply is not true. Orthodoxy is just one more example.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	I think because they choose not to jump on the "Seething debate" wagon. and if you look at where they are situated, they have bigger problems and concerns than this.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	The Orthodox Church in my country is trying to take over my government. <br>  How can I forget them, they are bloody horrible!<br>  <br>  I'm sick and tired of their backwards faith trying to be pushed on everyone.

wY8jE8HEaa	Where are the originals?<br>  <br>  If you mean to refer to the Injeel (the book revealed to Jesus /Eesaa, may Allaah exalt his mention) by the term (original bible), then we do not know the location of the copy you are asking about. But what we can say surely and without any doubt is that the Injeel has been altered and changed by human beings throughout history and the original copy no longer exists.<br>  <br>  Therefore, a Muslim has no need to search for its original copy after Allaah has sent the great Quran. Allaah Says (which means): {And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book [i.e. the Quran] which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.}[Quran 29:51].<br>  <br>  He also Says (which means): {And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam], the Book [i.e. the Quran] in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it.}[Quran 5:48].<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if by the term (original bible) you are referring to the book used by the Christians, then we say the following:<br>  <br>  In the Quran Allaah informs us that He revealed a number of books, including the pages of Prophet Abraham, the Psalms of Prophet David, the Torah of Prophet Moses, the Injeel (Gospel) of Prophet Jesus, and finally, the Quran of Prophet Muhammad. Of these revealed texts only the Quran remains intact in its original form. All of the others (as complete books) have been lost, their remains have survived only as fragments or tampered with in some way so as to make their authenticity doubtful. No where in the Quran is the Bible even mentioned, to say nothing of its being among the revealed texts of Allaah, or as Christian claim "The Word of God." Further, we know from respected scholars that although some fragments of the Psalms, the Torah, and the Injeel (the teachings of Prophet Jesus) may be found in the Bible, comprised of the Old and New Testaments, the Bible can not rightfully be called "The Word of God." Why is this so?<br>  <br>  As one publisher (Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., Wheaton, Illinois) stated: 'The Bible may look like one book, but it is actually sixty-six books in one. Thirty-nine books make up what we call the Old Testament, and twenty-seven make up the New Testament. It is possible that more than forty writers were used by God to write all sixty-six books.' (Quoted from the "Holy Bible" – New Living Translation, Gift & Award Edition, l997, p. vii)<br>  <br>  So if the Bible is neither narrated by God nor written by Him, and, as such, is not ‘the word of God,' then what is it? By any objective criteria, the Bible is a book containing a compilation of stories, legends, folk tales, folk lore, myths, sagas, narratives, poetry, fragments of scriptures (fragments from the Psalms, the Torah, and the Injeel as already mentioned), letters (esp. in New Testament), visions, dreams, accounts of events from doubtful sources (not eye witnesses), editors’ or scribes’ notes, as well as human errors.<br>  <br>  For those who believe in it, it is a book that has historical, cultural, moral and ethical values, and a source of spiritual teaching and guidance. It is a book held in high esteem, primarily by Christians who see it as a divine book and the source of their religious beliefs. But, in the final analysis it is only a book with many limitations and imperfections which disqualify it from being called "The Word of God." Whoever makes such a claim then the burden of proof rests with him. On the contrary, the Glorious Quran is the Speech of Allaah and, through the Angel Gabriel, was revealed to Prophet Muhammad, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam; later compiled into a book more than 14 centuries ago it remains in its original form until today. <br>  <br>  Some common misunderstandings about the Bible include the following:<br>  <br>  * The Bible is one book, the Old Testament. The Bible contains sixty-six books (or more depending upon the denomination one belongs to).<br>  <br>  * The Old Testament (OT) is the Torah followed by the Jews. The OT contains some fragments of the Torah which was lost and the Psalms, but the Talmud is the book followed by the Jews and is totally unrelated to the Bible.<br>  <br>  * The New Testament (NT) is the Gospel of Prophet Jesus, or the Injeel. It is neither. It is made up of twenty-seven books, none of which was narrated or written by Prophet Jesus although the NT may contain fragments of the Injeel (sayings and teachings of Prophet Jesus). The Injeel as revealed through Prophet Jesus has been lost. The fragments which may be cited in the NT may not be authentic or in their proper context. So it is erroneous to equate the NT with the Injeel mentioned in the Quran.<br>  <br>  * The Bible is a holy book, narrated, dictated by God and is infallible. While this is a claim, this misconception has already been addressed. Since the Bible is 'only' a book, there is no need to call it a forgery, a corrupted text, etc. The Quran is the only authentic "Word of God," His Speech,|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

The Holy Bible was written originally in Hebrew, Chaldean (a form of aramaic) and Greek ( a language derived from Hebrew).  The enemy has to attack the book to prevent it from being known to the world.  It is the Word of GOD-YHWH, not Allah.<br>  <br>  So, as a muslim, the two things I would ask you to consider as you look into the faith of the followers of Jesus is as follows.  1) the Koran or Qu'ran if you prefer, is supposed to open to you the Will of Allah.  It is intended so you can submit and obey and accept  the Will of Allah.  The Purpose of the Holy Bible, contrary to what most people believe, is NOT to reveal the will of GOD or YHWH.  It is to reveal GOD Himself.  Therefore by knowing GOD personally, He leads you.  He never asks for submission.  2) If the enemy (satan) has not attacked the Koran to confuse readers by having counterfeit versions, why not?<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, my seeking friend, if you want a good version of the Holy Bible which is a close english translation, you will need to stick with the King James or the New King James.  They are harder to read, because the English language has deteriorated, but they are generally better more accurate translations of the original language.  Partly because we have a less accurate language today.  For example, in Middle English, a word with th on the end like worketh rather than works, meant a continuing action.  God worketh in the hearts of men means he is continually working.  In todays language the same verse might read God works in the heart of man, which could be interpreted to mean a one time event.  See the difference.  Best of wishes in your journey.|`|AA10493307	One reason there are so many versions is for the purpose of getting the bugs out, that is, taking out the mistranslations of older versions, particularly the King James.  <br>  <br>  The King James drops the ball badly in regard to words like hell, everlasting, torture, etc.  This causes people to believe that God is sadistic, when, in fact, he isn't.  <br>  <br>  Each new version is an attempt to produce a perfect English translation of the Bible.  <br>  <br>  Has anyone succeeded?  <br>  <br>  The Concordant Translation appears to have a pure translation of the New Testament.  It drops the ball with the Old Testament, however.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	No, you get it.<br>  <br>  This council decided which books would make "the bible" about 1700 years ago; there were many different translations, and different people removed some books. But most are just different translations of the same texts.<br>  <br>  In the western world, killing people who have a slightly different version is frowned upon, which is why those different versions survived.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Not to be rude or anything, but I don't get the bible?<br>  <br>  Admitting that you don't "get" the bible is not rude.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) What I mean is why are there so many versions of the bible?<br>  <br>  Primarily it is a matter of translation.  For example, I have 3 English translations of "Around the World in 80 Days".  That book is only about 100 years old and was written in late 19th-century French, a language thoroughly understood by modern scholars.<br>  <br>  By comparison, the bible is much lengthier, much older and much more popular.  All of these things cause publishers to produce competing translations.  You will find competing translations of *most* classical foreign language literary works.   The more popular, the more versions there will be.  Likewise, the older, the more versions there will be.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) if you have a rule book, then why do you keep changing the rules over and over again?<br>  <br>  The rules are not being "changed" - they are being re-translated.  Compare the King James Version (1611) to the New American Standard Bible (1995) and you will see that the wording has been changed - but not the "rules".  IF you take into account the meanings of the words used in 1611, you will discover that, considering the length of the bible, only a very small portion has had the meaning altered - and that in accordance with more accurate translation practices.  In other words:  the accuracy of translation improves - incrementally - over time.  Still, there is very little change in meaning given as a percentage of the text.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) I'm a muslim<br>  <br>  OK - I understand better why you are confused.  Let's compare some facts about the Qur'an vs. the Christian bible.<br>  <br>  a) The Qur'an is a single book.  The bible is a collection of (at least) 63 books, also called Scriptures. (Note for Christians:  I am combining Samuel, Kings and Chronicles as in the original language).  My point:  the bible is MUCH longer than the Qur'an.<br>  <br>  b) The Qur'an was written about the 7th century C.E. - only about 1300 years ago.  The individual Scriptures of the bible were written over a period of *at least* 600 years, and probably more like 1500 years.  In addition, the last book of the bible was written, at the latest, in the early 2nd century C.E.  My points:  first, the bible is much older than the Qur'an.  Even though all of the languages in which the bible was written are still spoken, no one *writes* the same way today as did those ancients.  Indeed, the Hebrew of the bible had no vowels!  Second point:  language changes over time, and the books of the bible were written over a period of *centuries*.  The oldest Hebrew books of the bible use a Hebrew very different from the most recent Hebrew books of the bible.  You could become an expert in the Hebrew used in the book of Judges and you would not be an expert in the Hebrew used in the book of Malachi.<br>  <br>  c) The Qur'an was written in a single language.  The bible was written in 3 ancient languages - Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.  My point:  to read *and* correctly understand the bible in its original languages, you would need to be an expert in 3 ancient languages, over a linguistic period of 600 or more years.  To read *and* correctly understand the Qur'an, you need only be expert in the particular Arabic vocabulary and grammar used within that single book.<br>  <br>  d) The first bibles - the very first - were translations.  I think the reason is obvious, given what I have pointed out in c).  Very few, if any, scholars ever attain the expertise in these 3 ancient languages necessary to form a truly competent (trustworthy) understanding of the entire bible in the original languages.  The alternative - one that is very nearly always used - is to employ a *team* of experts, each expert in a particular language and a particular time period - to translate each book of the bible for which their expertise applies.<br>  <br>  For a Christian, learning to read the bible in its original languages is like someone learning to become a cardiologist, orthopedist and dentist so that they can diagnose all of their own medical problems.  The expertise necessary to gain a truly trustworthy understanding of *all* of the books of the bible in their original languages is beyond the reach of nearly every human being on the planet.  As we have done from the beginning, Christians rely on experts in the ancient languages to provide us with trustworthy translations of the original language texts.<br>  <br>  Over time, several things happen to improve the quality of these translations:<br>  a) we discover older, presumably more authentic original language manuscripts<br>  b) we learn how to translate these ancient languages even more accurately<br>  c) English changes, and so new translations use language that modern English-speakers will understand<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you to understand why we Christians rely on a translation of the bible (as we have always done) rather than on the original language texts, and why new translations are produced - with the intent of improving the quality (accuracy and precision) of the translation.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com.</a>|`|iblT1HJpaa	The Bible is unlike anything ever published. <br>  It is a collection of writings covering 1500+ years over many cultures, many languages and most importantly, many literary genres. <br>  Most people can only read/understand one language so the Bible has been "translated" into hundreds of languages for all to come to understand what God is trying to tell us about ourselves and about Him. <br>  And it's not the available translations that is the issue - it is the "meaning" of what is written. This is why there are so many translations. Not so much for the language, but for the methodology to explain the concept. And in that, nothing has changed! <br>  That other very difficult thing is the genre. Most of us understand what a "letter" is (1 & 2 Corinthians, Romans, Jude, Ephesians, etc..) and the "poetry" of Psalms is sheer beauty and even "gospel" makes sense (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), but when we cross over into "prophesy" and "apocalyptic" we get very lost. (Revelation, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah...)  We don't understand it and most people just blow it off. Such is the ignorance of man. If one does not "get it" they just disregard it. Such fools! <br>  Man wrote it out, but God is the Author. <br>  Again, how can dozens of languages, people, cultures and genres over almost 2000 years continue to hold a common theme? This can only come from God. <br>  You spoke the truth in your question. When you say that you "don't get the Bible" you have come to realize the scope of how much greater God is above you. You will NEVER come to understand the Bible for you are looking at the autobiography of God Himself. Ponder the depth of God and ASK Him to reveal Himself every single time you open the Bible. It is not for you to understand it - it is for God to tell you what it means!|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Well, many people have tried to "improve" the Bible by making what they call clarifications, or putting things in more modern language.  Unfortunately, every one of those attempts that I have seen does great damage and clouds things even further.

They were written in different languages for the people in certain and select areas dealing with certain and select issues.<br>  <br>  At one time a while back near 150AD, Rome allowed a number of different religions to thrive without hatred and animosity as long as the rules of the Empire were observed, such as taxes and business.  Mithras, YHWH, Sol Invictus, Apollo, as well as budding Christianity and Gnosim and other smaller cult like or oriented (meaning not organized widely) groups were allowed to thrive without much infighting.  Different Holidays were observed for all the differing groups which in some cases were not along the same days and often led to same type shops being closed for a week or more at a time.  No business no money, no money means no ability to pay taxes and then poof the cofferes of Rome were affected.  The Caesar at that time asked for a unifed form of religion, almost orthodoxation and organization to help regular the tax collection processes.  Many of the differing groups began to merge under roman regulation to a point where many deities were acclaimed to have the same stories and recognize the simularities of everything.  even birthdays and holidays merged so as not to offset the taxing seasons too much.  (December 25th was originally Mithra's birthday not Apollo or Jesus....and points to biblical reference where it states in the bible that jesus was born in the Spring not the middle of Winter)  With the Roman merging, all of the son and sun deities began observing the same datesfor rebirth that associate with solar calendars and such while esoteric deities merges to give credence to other forms of thought.<br>  <br>  It really was a great effort on Rome's part, although I know I will be ripped apart for saying so.  The original bible was written in Greek and Coptic, Hebrew, Aramaic and other forms of educated languages of the area.  Translating the different languages into a simular text began the process of editting.  The Greek Orthodox textx, the Hebrew texts..and so on and so forth until it became written in Latin for the emerging Catholic Church to use.  To be honest the Catholic Church was the only thing keeping the Roman lands from falling apart when Rome fell, in what.....500 or 600AD? Whenever the Dark Ages began.  It was then that the Relgious institution of the Church began gaining it's power and retaining, living on the fear that to deny the religion would be tantamount to allowing the chaos and infighting to begin.  A lot of Roman decendant rulers were in power of the different state entities that became the different countries of Europe and the Mediterranean.<br>  <br>  Over time the teaching of catholic Christianity (notice it is lowercase catholic for a reason) became necessary for the bible to go through more editting here and there to help the book keep true to the message the church wished to portray for the people to remain in worship.  The biggest revision that took place recently was the King James Version, where the King did not like several references to mythical creatures and stories identified not of Christian origin.  So he had them scribed out.  It was the most widely used version of the Bible in its day. (And do remember reading the bible was only a priveledge to the nobility and the educated at that time....reading the holy text when one was not of the need to know was akin to treason in certain parts of the realm)  Luther then printed the bible in German I believe for the common man to read and in turn earned himself an excommunication.  Protestants then seperated from the Catholic Faith and then divided some more.  Each group decided to revise and edit their own form of bible.<br>  <br>  Although the Bible has not had the sameprotections that the Quoran has throughout the years, it does still say the same basic things.  It's not the words that make the bible what it is, its the message.  Putting the words into language that people can read with an ever changing language bases, I think, it a very practical way to save the religion for the future.<br>  <br>  I do expect a new revision here shortly written in 1s and 0s call the Artificial Intelligence 1st edition standard revised that details the story of the 12 Tribes laid out in Battlestar Gallactica format.|`|k6ax2Cjmaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  You pose a wonderful question and one that I agree with you on. Why is there so many versions of the Bible? In my opinion, I believe it is Satan dividing our beliefs to cause confusion within the Christian belief. It is human nature to try to improve on our world, and unfortunately, the Devil tries to make us believe that we can improve on ancient text. <br>  <br>  I happen to read the King James Bible because it is the first translation that holds truest to the original text. I believe that there are some things you cannot improve on, and the Bible is one of those. Many Christians believe this. Just like there are those out there who wish to radicalize the Qur'an and take its text out of true translation to suit their own beliefs, there are those who make others believe they are Christian, but want a translation that suits their needs.<br>  <br>  I also think it is wonderful that you you want to learn about other beliefs. I think wisdom begins with an open mind, and by being open to other beliefs, you allow wisdom to grow. I happen to have a curiosity to know what the Qur'an speaks about, and have a few Muslim friends that help me understand the fundamentals of Islam.<br>  <br>  Lastly, in order to understand the Bible, you must first have the Holy Spirit guiding you to understand it. And for you to have the Holy Spirit guide you, you must first accept Jesus Christ as Savior. Jesus was more than a prophet or a good man. He was the GOD man. God loves you and gave up His Son to die for you. You can be guaranteed an eternal life in Heaven just by asking Jesus to be your savior. We do not need to add anything to this free gift. It's already been paid for; for you, for me, and the whole world. You have the choice to keep your beliefs and I totally respect them. I just wanted to explain why you may not understand the Bible.<br>  <br>  If you died today, Do you know 100% certain you would have a home in Paradise? If your answer is anything but YES I know, then settle that today and be sure by asking Jesus to take

971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Allowing gays to marry would have absolutely no affect on my marriage at all.  My marriage would be no more and no less than it is either way.  It's ridiculous.  It's a way of punishing gays for being "abnormal" by not letting them marry and have the same rights as heterosexuals.  Why on earth would my marriage (or ANYONE'S marriage for that matter) be threatened by homosexuals getting married?<br>  <br>  I agree with you whole heartedly - live and let live.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey, Charlie, if you hate something, at least know how to spell it.

pqDiBj5Laa	There is not that unique product . but you can do it with a mixture of Conventional courses,  foreign TV/ MOvies on their original audio track, or domestic  TV/Movies translated to foreign language on their audio track.<br>  Hey !!!   --  NO SUBTITLES --<br>  Its important to tune up your hearing, and then....<br>  <br>  The hardest step: To speak it , I know this is not easy , not cheap either:<br>  You have to travel and get acquaintances.<br>   <br>  The suggested order of learning is this:<br>  <br>  Read, listen, speak, and write whenever you feel ready.|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	To my knowledge, there is no product on the market that will help you learn to speak, read, and write a language you do not already speak and/or read, write. <br>  <br>  The metropolitan school district I substitute for has two language immersion schools. One is for Spanish only and the other is for Spanish or French. The children begin at age 5, and are taught either Spanish or French from the first day. Their teachers are bilingual, and every classroom has an assistant who is fluent in either Spanish or French. <br>  <br>  Lessons are presented in English and Spanish or French. The children learn their numbers in English; but, also in Spanish or French. They learn to read in English, then learn to read the same thing in Spanish or French. The process seems rather complicated; but, the children are astonishingly bilingual. The children who live in English-speaking homes, do not speak Spanish or French outside the classroom; but, they can converse with Spanish or French speaking people if the need arises. Those children who live in Spanish or French speaking homes are capable of speaking English outside their homes. I am amazed at the children's adaptability. <br>  <br>  I am of Cherokee Indian ancestry. My grandmother graduated from a Cherokee Female Seminary in 1902. She spoke, wrote, and read Cherokee fluently; however, none of her four children did--neither do I. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma began a Cherokee Immersion Language class about four years ago, where four-year-olds begin learning how to speak Cherokee. As their schooling progresses, they learn to read and write according to the syllabary developed by the Cherokee, Sequoyah. Parents are encouraged to speak Cherokee as much as possible in their homes, and to have their children read to them in Cherokee. As the children progress, they are encouraged to write to their parents, friends, and family members in Cherokee, teaching their family as they learn.<br>  <br>  The only way one can fully learn a new language--speaking, reading, and writing, is to live the language, whether it be German, Arabic, Russian, Italian, etc.

HC9lheydaa	Me encanta viajar porque me gusta conocer otras culturas, hacer nuevas amistades y comer una comida diferente. Tengo (???) bueno estrella porque he visitado muchos paìses como Francia, Estados Unidos, Italia, Marruecos, Londes y voy a Espa?a todos los a?os.<br>  El a?o pasado, en Julio, visitè mi a mi tìo en Espa?a para unas vacaciones con mi amiga Sarah. Mi tio vive en Murcia y nos quedamos diez dìas en su casa.<br>  Fuè fantastico. El tiene tres dormitorios, dos ba?os, un balcòn y un solario. Hacìa calor todos los dìas pero no me bronciè porque tenìa el filtro solar. Llevè mis sandalias, unas faldas, unos vestidos, unos pantalones cortos, unas camisetas , dos trajes de ba?o y mis gafas de sol. Ibamos a la playa todos los dìas y a veces ibamos a la piscina cerca de la casa. Por la ma?ana, hacìamos wind-surf, tomabamos el sol y nos ba?abamos. Al mediodia, ibamos a un restaurante de la playa  y un dìa comimos una paella buenisima. Durante nuestra estancia, conducia el coche de mi tio. Estaba nervioso porue estaba conduciendo a la izquierda. El ultimo dia lloramos porqe no queriamos volver a Irlanda.<br>  Hace dos a?os, en invierno, pase mis vacaciones en Nueva York. Fui con mis dos tias y una amiga que se llama Yvonne. Viajamos en aviòn desde Dublìn y el vuelo duro seis horas. Tuvimos "jetlag" y quedamos muy cansadas ese dia. Fuimos a Nueva York porque quieriamos ir de expedicion en tiendas y yo quise visitar los lugares de mi interes (que me interesaban). Nos quedamos la semana en hotel de cuatro estrellas y fuè muy bonito. Llevè un abrigo, unas botas, una bufanda, guantes y un sueter de lana porque hacia frio y nevaba. Un dia fuimos al cine y vimos una pelicla de terror. No me gusto porque tenia subtitulos pero compre muchos dulces y palomitas que eran deliciosas. Llevamos mucho dinero a Nueva York. Anduvimos por las tiendas(por los negocios) todos los dias. El primer dia, visitamos una zapateria porque mis tias les encantan los zapatos pero no compraron ninguno. Yo comprè unas botas negras y unos zapatos de tacon alto. Estaban en descuento. Despues, fuimos a una tienda de ropa. Me probe una camiseta y un vestido pero la camiseta me quedaba apretada y el vestido era demasiado caro. Yvonne probo un abrigo y un sueter gris. Lo llevo y lo pago con carta de crdito. Almorzamos en un restaurante peque?o y comì un perro caliete con papas fritas. Nuestros pies quedaron muy cansados. Luego, visitamos una joyeria u miramo unos aretes de oro y un reloj pero no eran de buena calidad y eran mas caro de los de mi "casa" (o pais). La ultim noche, fuimos al teatro de Broadway y vimos el musical Mamma Mia. Hicimos muchas fotos. Me gustaria volver a Espa?a este verano y mejorar mi espa?ol pero tengo que encontrar un trabajo y ganar dinero.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm native spanish speaker... you have some mistake but you're good!!! <br>  ;-)
2gTgw9o9aa	no just cuz your gay doesnt mean you have to look like a guy... becuz lesbians like GIRLS. keep your hair and they probly just dont kno you are.<br>  do what you feel comfortable with.|`|7nHuDxivaa	I a man, but a lot of lesbians have the same haircut as me|`|LeHpIFwyaa	If they know you then I think it is a compliment...a lot of lesbians are seen as masculine.  Overall I think they were just giving you a compliment that you are Smokin.  Also maybe they have noticed you swing more to girls and just want to help you admit your sexuality more openly.  You won't ever know exactly what they meant unless you ask the people who told you this because everyone here including me is just speculating...<br>  <br>  Be who you are and dress, cut your hair how you want...I personally like girls with longer hair...I think it is more sexy and a bigger turn on than a butch cut.  Just be yourself and let it shine.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|jbkrZTiraa	you have lesbians that guys want to see together, cos they're sexy.<br>  and then they're aren't<br>  <br>  i just think that they mean your hot and basically they wouldn't mind see-ing a bit of you with a girl haha<br>  <br>  i wouldn't take it to seriously|`|XA5jXtkfaa	she is a lesbian too and she likes you
6DmsiLGbaa	I see nothing wrong with learning about other faiths.  Knowledge is never a bad thing.  I'm a strong member of my own faith, but I still attend other services when my friends invite me.  I think it makes me a better friend to know more of their beliefs.<br>  <br>  And if you don't want those missionaries to come back, just tell them so.  Or tell them from the start that you only want to learn.  Having been one of those Mormon missionaries myself, I doubt that they'll mind.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I don't see anything wrong with taking field trips in order to educate yourself about different cultures.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	I think it is a good thing to study all religions compare them with the Bible and then when you hear the ring of truth you will know it.<a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a>|`|JUviY9hoaa	Nope - I think it's a great idea to educate yourself. That way when you DO get presented with an argument, no matter what you believe, you have the information to back up your claims. And you DON'T come out sounding like an idiot.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Of course not.  Just don't say so.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Nope, investigate away!|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	You need intellectual reasoning to find the object of getting into spiritual paths. The blind who follows the words are normally doomed to  live in the state of ignorance. <br>  The reason why in the Book of Proverbs you are asked to get Wisdom even if  is costly is because that is the only way you may learn to know and then know to understand.<br>  Any religious leader that will tell you to listen and follow because I say so is not telling you way to get wisdom. <br>  Its only through your wisdom that you maybe able to live righteously and justly with love, understanding, compassion and mercy that you may live in God. <br>  Intelligence is the knowledge of the mind that leads him to spirituality where the heart is. What normally we find as essential are often invisible to the eye where only the heart can see.|`|FkwU07iDaa	Not at all.  Most churches would welcome you.<br>  <br>  There are churches and quasi-church groups which will try to persuade (or even bully) you into membership, but most mainstream churches are happy for people to visit just to find out what is going on.<br>  <br>  You might find that a particular church appeals to you and you eventually want to consider membership.  On the other hand you may find that none appeals to you.  But you won't know without trying them.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	i would hope people do not think so.  what harm could there be in taking an interest in learning?  i would not hide my intentions from the people that run/attend these churches if i were you.  if they do not like it then you can find another, more open church.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I think it is smart. How would you know what to avoid if you did not investigate. You are correct in being fascinated, it is hard to imagine how anyone (many intelligent!) can believe in and practice Christianity.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Go for it!<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	Go ahead, see for yourself. My faith has nothing to hide from intellectual pursuits.|`|93aY6WzAaa	You're going to hell.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Not at all.Ive done it too:)|`|pqveENjUaa	No. Most religious leaders would be perfectly okay with you expressing your interest. But it would be best to explain your intentions to the leader first so that he can prepare something wonderful for you to hear, and then to show up several weeks later when he/she isn't expecting you so you can hear what is really said there. <br>  <br>  I only say to check first to make sure that it's okay. Some more cult-esque groups will be immediately offended and might even fire-bomb your house. o.O|`|6w1e6zUVaa	Because no one will know that you're there for educational, not religious, purposes how would they get offended.  So my answer is no.  Do as you please.  Just so long as you don't plan on standing in front of the congregation and announcing it to the entire church.|`|bZK5Gm1Vaa	I think that's a really interesting way of life, and if you went to my church sometime (Lutheran Christian church) I don't really think people would care. I think most would actually think it was interesting. and pretty darn cool :)|`|YfMvrdHNaa	no.<br>  <br>  I have a similiar belief, religion does not equal faith. Also, I think God gives us minds and does expect us to use them. Faith may be blind but faith isn't necessarily ignorant.|`|C42YeDPuaa	There's nothing wrong with the pursuit of knowledge.  If a church objects to being "investigated" there's something wrong on their end, not yours.|`|rqcY0iYGaa	everybody is welcome in church|`|PS6Pjtndaa	I cannot speak to all religions. I've "heard" that you cannot go to a Mormon church without being Mormon.  Not sure.  But Christian churches are open to all.  Two cautions:<br>  <br>  1. Do NOT partake of the sacrament of the Lord's supper.  That is for BELIEVERS ONLY!  If you fake your belief just to partake in that sacrament then you bring judgment on yourself.<br>  <br>  2. Please don't lie to them if they ask what brings you here.  You don't have to tell them everything you just told us, but say something vague like: "I was curious about your church.  I wanted to see what it's like."  Don't pretend to be a believer if you're not.<br>  <br>  Deal?<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|deqX4oQQaa	No I welcome you myself to New Beginnings Church of God here in Gastonia N.C., You may get there and the power of God falling on us lead you to finally whole heartedly believe and you receive true salvation. Hebrews 10:25 basically says don't forsake the assembling of the saints.<br>    Have a Blessed one Jesus Christ is in Charge of everything and in due time every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is King of all and His( Their Godheads) Words are true. John 14:6 I am the way, the truth, and the Life. No man may come unto the Father except by Me.<br>    But please continue to have a Blessed Day. Matthew 7:1 tells us Judge not lest you be judged. We all have free will to believe whatsoever we choose God gave us that right as humans. With that said He also gave us His Holy Word The Bible to go by.
KWeU8LJtaa	Sigh.<br>  <br>  This is perfectly normal, it's human nature. Sex and sexual thoughts are just part of being human.<br>  <br>  You're fine.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well the most Biblical advice I can give you is Not the advice of fighting it, NOt the advice of hitting it head-on but rather of getting intense other interests going. Success is not so much when you get the thoughts to fight them (though it includes that) but to <br>  "nd do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,"<br>  <br>  Even better :<br>  Phil. 4:8<br>  <br>  Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.<br>  <br>  YOU WILL BE MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU DON"T EVEN THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE BETTER OR NOT !!!|`|ibAJ0YiMaa	No one is getting hurt!

Please stay away from that, it will not add anything positive to your life. God bless your efforts.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	No one is getting hurt if you tend to your own needs.

We are to put off the old nature, the flesh does not please God and put on the new nature and live in the Spirit.  You can start with confession.  I have found that when I confess the temptation it is taken away from me more easily.  We are not animals so don’t take the advice that sex is natural so it's ok for porn, we are to be pure, and have a relationship with a spouse only.  We will always have temptation and the flesh and the Spirit will always tug against one another.  I was watching Joyce Myers the other morning and it was about temptation and what I got out of it was we are not to run from temptation, but see it through, and face it with God.<br>  <br>  No matter how many times you have to confess it, confess it.  God bless you for acknowledging your sin, now give it to Jesus and claim victory in Him.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Seriously, it's stuff like this that makes me feel so sad for you guys.

Look at them objectively and realize they are not of the Kingdom.  Don't struggle with them, just watch and they will go away.  Inquire of God and the spirit behind the porn will flee in terror when it sees that you are letting God do battle for you, in faith to Him.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Once you know what sins you have been born with (Mark 7:20-23) and see yourself transparently in front of Gods Law and admit that you are a sinner bound for hell, and if God does not save you that you will indeed persish.

It may not hurt anyone, but it causes an increased expectation to what sex really is. Not many people have the kind of sex that is portrayed there, and while it might be really exciting to watch it isn't very fun to perform. At all. Ever wondered why it takes so long for them to "finish?" <br>  <br>  Porn doesn't hurt anyone, except you and who you are going to be with. My advice is to stay away from the magazines and the dirty webpages on your computer. If you are tempted to look it up, log off. Just try to separate yourself from it and the urge will go away.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	When I was younger (about a thousand years ago). I had these same thoughts. And did that Porn thingy for awhile. But GOD knows us better than we know ourselves.  You must forgive yourself as HE does.<br>  <br>  Your guilty feelings lead you right to HIM. Pray to JESUS, ask HIM to strengthen you, To forgive your backsliding and mostly to set off that little, NO,NO,NO in your mind.<br>  <br>  It's when we just go back to our same old ways?

My Messenger contact has a new and revived resolution to stop watching pornography because of His LOVE for God. Do you have a girlfriend? Do you love God? <br>  <br>  If you do have a girlfriend and/or if you love God, your love and devotion to God and/or your girlfriend should be your motivation to stop watching pornography. It is very simple and effective for the Holy Spirit will speak to your heart. He will CONVICT you and PIERCE your heart with a sword sharper than the double-edged sword. You will HEAR from the Holy Spirit. You have RECEIVED His Spirit!<br>  <br>  He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. (1 John 3:8) Do not GRIEVE the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were SEALED for the day of redemption. (Ephesians 4:30) Whoever has been BORN of God does not sin (Romans 8:14), for His SEED (SPIRIT) remains in him; and he cannot sin without the Spirit's CONVICTION, because he has been BORN of God. (1 John 3:9)<br>  <br>  The Spirit does not indwell us (Romans 8:10; Ephesians 2:22) because of our love, because He first loved us; on the contrary, He ENABLES us to love. I say then: WALK in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. (Galatians 5:16-17)<br>  <br>  And whatever we ask we receive from Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us (1 John 5:14), because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

I don't know if it's the truth or not, but I heard a rumour that they have been downsizing thier staff, and the network is suffering for lack of qualified people to tend to it.  In general, the last few years it has seemed to me as though yahoo has been more intent on adding new bells and whistles because they think a new look on a page or some neat new feature will keep people interested, but it seems to me that while they are piling on all kinds of new features, they are doing so on a crumbling foundation, what good is it to have new stuff if they aren't tending the infrastructure. Frankly, a system that is reliable keeps me interested. That's why I'm getting rid of my business account with them...

8I9uduIiaa	Interesting post :)<br>  <br>  <br>  In Judaism, the only person who can actually forgive anything - is the victim.<br>  <br>  So you see, we cannot 'forgive' those who perpetrated the Holocaust. It is outside our power to do so.<br>  <br>  And - to give a frank answer - even if Judaism agreed with forgiving on behalf of the victim, I would not and could not forgive those who slaughtered six million Jews (including one million children) and millions of NON Jews also.<br>  <br>  Some things are, simply, beyond forgiveness.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nizkor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nizkor.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	Because they are taught to forgive by the very God they brought knowledge of to us. We forgive if we want to be forgiven. We forgive because it is "the way" of God. Jewish men and women know that deeply for the most part. So for the most part you will find them forgiving the trespasses of others against them. That is "the way" God wants us to live.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	It's not just the Holocaust but 2,000 years of history. <br>  <br>  I realize that the actions of a few are not indicative of an ENTIRE group of people: That would be generalizing much like this poster above did:<br>  <br>  "I've never done anything harmful towards any Jew, but if I criticize Judaism or Israel, I'm a bigoted anti-semite. And that's the way it's always been, all my life, for anyone who dares to criticize."<br>  <br>  You can see the lack of separating ideology from individual right here. <br>  Have I accused this person of being a bigoted antisemite? No, so why make the generalization?<br>  <br>  If this person was such a "history buff" he would know the reasons why some questions are seen in a negative light, and he would learn to rephrase them in a more appropriate manner.<br>  <br>  This can be said for all religions, races, and creeds.  Having a good sociological background about any cultural group can prevent one from making social faux pas.<br>  <br>  An example of this would be pointing at something you are showing a buyer in Japan: That would be considered a sincere form of disrespect.|`|DTog0VZWaa	For me it was in realizing that the Holocaust is an act of human beings...would you have behaved any better?  Would I?  If you'd been exposed & taught this stuff?  (My dad's a survivor so I've been wrestling with these questions since early childhood.)<br>  <br>  It's important to look at specific elements that funneled into the Holocaust.  The way people corraled into supporting a megalomanic pyschopath as a dictator & brought him to power.  The way Christianity for centuries had taught deep insane hate at Jews & killed many...and this was just one more huge progrom...something that Chrsitanity has had to look itself in the mirror & learn more so it can make the needed changes.  We need to learn, how do people see hate but let it exist?<br>  <br>  However, Judaism teaches us to see ourselves in others.  A few specifics of Judaism that help:<br>  <br>  1. That humans are imperfect.  It doesn't teach that any of us expected to be perfect only to strive to moral.  In that way, we are always looking at ourselves...but can then understand too that others can go wrong.<br>  <br>  2. That one is responsible only for one's own actions.  Also that making amends to the person you've harmed counts.  So, we don't look at "future generations" as responisble for their parents actions.  They ARE responsible for their thoughts & ways in which they may still harbor the same awful concepts.<br>  <br>  3. Judiasm is about living this life in a way that contributes to the world to make it better.  It does no good to be bitter & shriveled up.  If someone harms you, it's better to reach out & try to teach them that.  Meanwhile, while hoping they learn, Judaism is very life affirming & we focus on building a new...moving forward.  It is better to reach inside for the good, than to let other's hates take us over.<br>  <br>  4. Judaism at it's roots is self-empowering.  Much of the hate at Jews is to take that away.  However, that root can help you rebuff the urge to hate & help move forward.  Everyone who faces a rape or assault has to choose how to hold it inside themselves.  Judaism itself helps one focus on the holding onto the good inside yourself.  <br>  <br>  Your other choice to become hateful like them.  And that would be letting them win.<br>  <br>  =====<br>  To that end rather than attacking that one answerer who focused on attacking Israel falsely with their hate of Israel & of Jews...I'll say, it's just bogus attacks.  Please learn more, from other sources that aren't inclined to hate Israel to begin with.<br>  <a href="http://onevoicemovement.org" rel="nofollow">http://onevoicemovement.org</a><br>  <br>  I'm finding the TDs on this question extremely sad.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Some Jews are going to be told, "Come, thou blessed of my Father."  I once thought a Jewish boss of mine was a Catholic.  She appeared to embody every virtue that Christians say they value, though maybe she could have given me more benefit of the doubt, but I digress.<br>  <br>  We could learn no end of things from the Jews.  Like The Book of Mormon says, "What thank they [the Christians] the Jews [for providing them the Bible]?"  The Lord did not lie to the Israelites.  If we do not understand the ancient scriptures, we're not going to understand the more recent ones.<br>  <br>  There is a Jewish holiday that I wish everybody in the world would observe.  It is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.  If I am not mistaken, one of the observances of Yom Kippur is unconditional forgiveness.  Is that easy?  Of course not.  Jews have not exactly had a cushy existence.  But I have to say that good Jews have such noble character that we'd do well to emulate them in many ways.|`|d9fb1dd645e4f5559a0eee63dd4ba255aa	I don't know either.

They have been treated badly through the ages, heaven knows why.<br>  <br>  Edit:  The poster above me probably hasn't read a history book in his/her whole life.|`|Rl1Qqcqzaa	I disagree with your premise:  there are NOT "so many Jews" who forgave.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

7J9Eb3VCaa	I haven't really been around a lot of Chinese people or Asian for that matter. Utah isn't very diverse. I love Mexicans. I've been to Mexico a few times and they are so friendly and fun. They have such a great culture and bring all of that with them when they come here. They have great family values and take time off to spend time with their family. Americans are always go go go and hardly ever spend time with their families. Their festivals and traditions are so fun they sure know how to relax and have a good time. They are hard workers in everything they do. Americans are lazy and don't like to lift a finger. I also respect the Asian cultures they are so unique and hold to their traditions. They work hard as well and take schooling very seriously. Of course these are all stereotypes other than I've had first hand experience with Mexicans and have many Mexican friends.|`|hkzGYQD4aa	Mexicans speak Spanish if you are talking about language.

ay2029Slaa	I'm in the minority, being a Pagan here on Y!Answers...<br>  <br>  If there IS an actual Heaven & Hell (very doubtful IMO) I think we would all be judged on our actions not just the fact that we didn't join Jesus' Fan Club.<br>  <br>  There are so many other people, religions, and ways of living in the world I personally think it is very ignorant and self righteous to think that YOUR way is the ONLY way and that a 14 year old boy dying in Africa will go to Hell because he doesn't believe the same things you do.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question: People are Christian because either  they were born into it, or they have had a powerful experience to prove to them there is a Higher Source (God) and have had enough missionaries tell them it was the work of Jesus and were Born Again into it.<br>  <br>  However, more and more people ARE leaving Christianity for alternate religions (i.e. Buddhism or Agnosticism) in the U.S.... so I think it would be hard for me to say that people are "flocking" to Christianity.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	it's okay you don't have to accept the religion if you don' want to.|`|gWleYSuIaa	If hell exists and you think it would be okay to go there, you dont understand the concept at all.|`|WyICbuPqaa	The real question is whether Christianity is more likely to be true than other beliefs.  I submit that it is.  In the end, this opinion relies on a spiritual conversion - a divine testimony given by God to the sincere seeker of truth.  To those that have received this testimony of God, there is no question that Christ was the Son of God.<br>  <br>  Truth cannot be cherry picked.  Popular opinion does not make something true.  Truth is a knowledge of things as they actually are.  It is important for us to decide the criteria upon which we will believe something to be true.  Our own eye witness is perhaps the most compelling reason to believe something is true, but it is not the only one.  The testimony of trusted sources is another reason to believe something is true.  You and I may differ on what sources can be trusted, but we both trust the testimony of others to shape our world view.  The Bible is not one book, but a collection of many books.  They have one thing in common - they are accepted as trusted sources of honest testimony.  The books in the Book of Mormon are also accepted as trusted sources by a subset of Christians, and the books of the Pearl of Great Price by a subset of Mormons.  The real question in all of this is who to trust, or what sources of testimony can be relied on?  <br>  <br>  Personally, I have come to rely on the testimony of the Holy Ghost, which has born witness to me of the truth of the Book of Mormon, and of many other things.  I can differentiate between its voice and the voices of others in this chaotic world, and I have found it to be reliable.  When I have ignored it, it has always been to my detriment.  The Holy Ghost once answered my prayer, and correctly foretold of an unlikely future event.  I don't know of any other source that can give me that level of reliability.  I would be a fool to ignore it.  I have to believe that it is real, and comes from God.<br>  <br>  As far as heaven and hell - that is just the belief of some Christians, not all.  Christ himself taught that there were many mansions in his father's kingdom - a place for almost everyone.  He also taught that the righteous will be better off than the wicked.  A righteous Buddist will be better off than a wicked Christian.  God is fair, and will judge fairly.  Mormons teach that God is no respector of persons, and that everyone will have the opportunity to accept the light and knowledge that comes from God, either in this life, or in the spirit world.<br>  <br>  "For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."  1 Peter 4:6|`|m3ThrbDMaa	It's a very moving story...<br>  <br>  And just because it's "loosely based" on what might be real people, the good message that I get from The Gospels is that the highest form of human thought that would match God's (if there is one, who the Hell knows?) is that we should love each other instead of butcher each other, and I think that's not a bad message to spread around if they would just do it right and have James Brown-like concerts every Sunday, cuz I say let's turn church's into a "full music experience, Woo Yaw, Amen ta' THAT, Brutha's and Sista's...!|`|J8uhpecYaa	People flock towards Christianity because it's easier to conform and not examine your views than it is to think about whether it is a legitimate system of belief.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	I'm against most Christian "Religion."<br>  However, I do believe the Bible (KJV) is 100% accurate. <br>  After studying many things for many years, I've examined the the facts and I'm convinced the Bible is true.<br>  <br>  It's not a question of being a good person or being afraid of hell.  It's a matter of one's epistemology.  What is true, and what is not. It's that simple.  The Book is true.<br>  <br>  The Book says that there are none good, and that all have sinned and are in need of a Savior. Beyond simply believing that the facts of the gospel are true, a person must receive (John 1:12) Jesus Christ as their Savior in accordance with Romans 10:9-13.|`|UE6t8SqSaa	Your statement:<br>  <br>  "Quite seriously, neither exists.

Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the account of Christ's death on the cross; at that point the veil of the Jewish temple (an extremely thick, heavy cloth that kept everyone but the high priest out) was torn from top to bottom.  Very cool symbolism!<br>  <br>  In everything I study about science, about the Universe, about the existence of God, I am amazed at the apparent love that God has for mankind.  The beauty of nature and its design speak out that God cares for us and covets a relationship with us.<br>  <br>  Hell doesn't enter into it.  I honestly don't care what's in Heaven or Hell.  They could be exactly the same place for all I care, and I'd choose to go to where Jesus was.  <br>  <br>  I honestly don't get how you can read the Bible three times and not be impressed by the love of Jesus.|`|uMKWNhLkaa	Christian reponse.<br>  I see you understand Judaism.<br>  So Christianity will be easy to understand,.<br>  You know then the Jews scriptures is the Tanahk, aka OT.<br>  In the OT, the are 50 very specific prophesies on what the Messiah will fulfill (Jesus).<br>  Prophesies like the messiah will be born in Bethlehem, born to a virgin, be nailed to a stake, ressurect on the 3rd day, be sold by a friend for 30 pieces of silver.<br>  Anyway, amazingly Jesus fulfills these very specific prophesies.<br>  Now Christians out number Jews 150 to 1, mainly because of this.<br>  He is obviously the Messiah.<br>  As the Messiah he started a New Testament with man.<br>  <br>  Maybe you think Christians changed the OT around to make out Jesus was the Messiah. <br>  Remember OT is aka Tanakh, Jews would bust Christians with tampering if it was the case.

Lots of times however, people that are brought up to be a certain religion never quite understand it, and sometimes only practice it just because they are used to it and so they just go through the motions.  Essentially all of the major religions are the same at their core, its just the little details that sound better to certain people and attract them to that religion.  It seems to me that people flock to religions because it gives them a sense of hope, although since im not one of those people i cant say for sure.|`|iBQAd6Wtaa	I am a Christian because I believe Jesus Christ died for mankind.<br>  I love the fact that He had me in his mind when He died on the cross and suffered for me, and everyone else.<br>  <br>  I became a Christian because I was kind of messed up.

He has always been on my side.<br>  <br>  I love Jesus, He has helped me with so many of my problems and He has never abandoned me. That is another great thing, He is always there for you. When you feel scared, you can be comforted knowing Jesus is with you, in your heart.<br>  <br>  And I guess an attractive part is that you only need to do one thing.<br>  All you have to do is ask for forgiveness, and take Him as your savior.<br>  You don't have to live your life a certain way, but you kind of just know, "I shouldn't do that", when there's something you shouldn't be doing.<br>  <br>  And there's a feeling of acceptance. When people have done so much ill towards others, and killled people, and done so much evil, Jesus won't reject them. His offer is still there, you just have to accept it.<br>  <br>  Please think about His offer for your salvation, and you might just make the best decision of your life.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to a choice, whether or not you accept Jesus's gift is up to you.

Modern humans have been around for at least 100 thousand years according to evolutionary biologists and during that time there was so much suffering, so much disease, famine, poverty, starvation. There were also so many wars and fights and needless death, so much needless destruction caused my man, as well right? So much SIN!<br>  <br>  So god finally decided that after 98 thousand years of watching this go on, he should impregnate a Jewish "virgin" that would give birth to his "son" who would then be crucified in such a bloody grotesque fashion, and that this would somehow make it all better. Of course god chose for all of this to take place in an illiterate barbaric part of the middle east as well. I guess "mysterious" is one way of putting it.<br>  <br>  So do you think that when Jesus comes again, if God sends him again,... will those guys get it right this time?

So there is SOME truth to the fear factor that you have stated. I think it is because most people have figured out that we are not the supreme beings, or don't wish to believe when you die that it's over and you are just dust with no exixtence. I was raised catholic and hoodoo, and respect whatever element I get a proper response from, or positive. I have always worked with more tangible religions, and with those you see results. Then the problem is not the belief in the religion, but rather how to conduct yourself in everyday life and whether or not you are a bad person. But then again, that should be the goal of whatever religion you pick, to access yourself and what kind of person you are. I would personally refer you to a tangible religion, or to someone I know that dosn't answer questions here. But I am sure he could help you. He is very knowledgabe, and practices many tangible religions, and also christianity. Let me know if you would like to contact him, he dosn't convert or preach, only shared his lessons from his spiritual growth and search with others. He simply offers information and point in a direction. If you are interested please let me know. He is part of an elite secret practice the combines alot of different beliefs, so he is knowledgable in many things. They are called the Comtanspi.

God Bless|`|GRfeHGBoaa	Disclosure: I'm an atheist living in the Bible Belt (deep South, USA)<br>  <br>  I think your question is one that deserves a thoughtful answer, since it seems to be a thoughtful question.  I happen to agree with your minimalist assessment of Christianity. The big problem with it is that, at least with most interpretations, unless you have chosen the "right" version of Christianity, you lose, i.e., go to hell.<br>  <br>  However, I do not believe that's a valid interpretation.  I believe that, if one looks at the life of the prophet Jesus Christ as explained by the Bible, it's not about whether you select the proper church, it's about whether you live a caring life - love your fellow man and help out people who do not have the same advantages as you do.  With that interpretation, all you have to do is live in accordance with the 10 commandments. Now, many Christians also believe you do have to belong to the "right" brand; and I think they're wrong.  I think there may well have been a guy who preached about loving your fellow man and being good to each other - a Jesus figure. But what he said, really, was believe in God, treat other people the way you want to be treated, don't cheat or steal or murder and you're on the right path. Nothing wrong with that. It's in the interpretation where it gets all fouled up - and I don't happen to believe that if Jesus were to visit again, he'd be all that happy with the way his words have been interpreted.<br>  <br>  I think there are many good people who are Christians who do follow Jesus' example - and there are good people who follow all kinds of religious paths or spiritual paths. My personal feeling is that, considering the fact that the vast majority of religions in the world share most of the same basic beliefs - and even, in large part, the same mythologies right down to similarities between prophets, their lives (all the way down to birth dates, death/resurection stories) and teachings, and creation stories, etc., etc., etc. - they are really, by and large, all the same thing: a mythology that provides a guideline for living as a decent human being. <br>  <br>  That being said, if you treat other people the way you expect to be treated, the world works better for everyone. Since I don't happen to believe in the heaven/hell afterlife, living the one we've got here is much more important than what happens next. If, in reality, this is all you get - you might as well make the best of it - for you, for the people you love, and for the other people you encounter. Love your fellow man, love yourself, treat everyone with respect.<br>  <br>  So, in short, my answer is that people who follow most of the world's religions, including Christianity, are looking for the same thing: guidance on how to live a decent life. I think a lot of Christians join their churches more for the social community than for the spiritual guidance, and unfortunately, there are many hateful preachers - and believers - out there who want people to believe their version is the only real one and everyone else is going straight to hell, no matter how good they are. That is a divisive and in some interpretations downright mean version of Christianity - and I think it does a disservice to the prophet. Jesus said where two or more are gathered in God's name, there is a "church" - in other words, if you're sharing your spiritual quest with one other person, you're acting as a church for each other - helping each other interpret the meaning of God. If that is so, it doesn't matter whether you've got the brand right, whether you've jumped through the right hoops or whatever.  What matters is how you live and whether you are a believer.<br>  <br>  For Christians, the "believer" part of that equation is extremely important - as it is for most religions. But my own feeling is that what truly matters is how you live your life.<br>  <br>  Maybe we are all part of a bigger whole - maybe there is something beyond this life. But you've got no real way of knowing, which is why faith is so important to the Christian religion. You should have faith in the mythology without any proof.  <br>  <br>  But my bet is on the "living a good life" part of the equation. Regardless of what religion you subscribe to, treating others with respect makes this life better, making this life better is what we all really seek, so live the best life you know how to live and if you get rewarded for that in an afterlife, it's a great bonus. If not, you didn't waste the one life you know you've got.<br>  <br>  And if there is a hell, I've got box seats - for being a non-believer. :)|`|ISXrAh0caa	I'm a Christian. I have reasons and I have my proof but my proof wouldn't work for anyone else. Things I've felt, things I've seen are proof enough for me. Christianity honestly isn't easy for me. I'm a very fact based, logical person like my father who actually is an atheist. But like I said what I've experienced and felt can't just be explained away. And I know some are laughing at me. "What? A logical Christian? That's an oxymoron if I've ever heard one." Well, I am who I am.|`|MQlBlKNiaa	EDIT:<br>  Well, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Moses, David - they didn't believe in Jesus directly but they trusted in God alone for salvation - they completely relied on God.  Their hearts were wholly after God.  <br>  Now that Jesus has been preached throughout the whole world as God's salvation - the good news message of peace with God through Him - that Jesus commanded his disciples to bring to the ends of the earth, I would not want to risk taking His sacrifice lightly or mocking His methods.  I would not want to stand before God presenting to Him my own "goodness" when He emptied Himself of His glory to become one of us to represent us and take our place, exchanging our sin for His Goodness.  <br>  I stand before God clothed with His own righteousness that He attributes to me by His grace.  The bible says our own righteousness is like filthy rags.  For all have sinned and fall short of His glory.... but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Who can stand in God's presence? Only the pure in heart.  Are you sure you are pure in heart? Don't lie to yourself.<br>  <br>  AND it is only through Jesus Christ that we are filled with the Holy Spirit.  The Spirit of God is our assurance that we are children of God.   Without the Spirit we have no assurance.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You know how we call people "adults" and "mature" after they reach a certain age?  Well if you are a parent you will realise that noone ever really becomes perfectly mature or adult character-wise.  I teach my kids to behave in a way that I am not even fully capable of lol.  Who obeys the most important commandment "Love God with all your heart soul mind and strength" let alone the second most important "Love your neighbour as yourself"?<br>  <br>  The bible shows us the only perfectly mature adult - Jesus Christ.  Only He loved perfectly.  Buddha didn't...neither has anyone else.  <br>  <br>  The thing is, I can try and try in my own strength to love perfectly but I always fail.  I am a slave to myself.  ONLY through trusting in God's love for me - that I was created by Jesus and for Jesus and that all of history (including His choosing the Israelites to foreshadow Jesus' sacrifice) was to bring about God's plan to make us into the likeness of His Son (through His sacrifice and ressurrection) and so exist in a perfect eternal relationship with Him -ONLY through being born again spiritually and given a new nature am I set free to love - not by relying on my own strength - by the Spirit of God as I rest in His love.<br>  <br>  God is the father I never thought I wanted, but now find is the only one who holds freedom for me.  ONLY HIS LOVE SATISFIES ME.  I have a wonderful husband who loves me....gorgeous kiddies...amazing parents....but their love is completely different to the love of God..it doesn't come near it!! .  <br>  God is too much! He's awesome.  His TRUTH is soooo refreshing in this world where we even decieve ourselves!! I love Him to pieces!  I hate to be out of contact with Him!  He is PERFECT PERFECT peace.  No amount of buddhist meditation or strict lifestyle will give you that.  <br>  <br>  I thought I was giving my life to God - But it was Him who gave HIMSELF to me!!!!!  <br>  <br>  Mankind is SOOOOO privilleged.  I am just so buzzed out that I am a child of the Only Creator God.  And I have a relationship with the SOURCE of ALL!!! I want EVERYONE to have this and NOONE to miss out.  HELL to me would be knowing what I missed out on if I hadn't humbled myself to seek God.  Hell to me would be to not be able to receive or give love when I was created to be a channel of God's love - to receive it and pour it out.|`|VNLKiIpraa	I'm a Christian (I know, I know, shun the believer), but perhaps not the normal christian you would think of.  I believe in God for one reason: because that is what makes sense to me.<br>  <br>  I have thought about the big bang, evolution, etc. and it has just not made much sense to me.  I figure, even if the big bang is real, where did all of this come from?  where did the matter to start the big bang come from?  Nothing could just be here forever, so it must have been put here by someone or something.<br>  <br>  I am open to all beliefs, i actually find many fascinating, but what it really comes down to is that nobody really knows for sure where we came from or why we are here.  Everyone has a theory that fills that void where that question is.  That question can never be answered with 100% certainty.<br>  <br>  That is why I don't try to push my religion on people, and why I respect other peoples opinions on how we got here, because frankly, I don't even know, this is just what sounds good to me, and that is where faith comes in.  Faith in a god, or faith in an intelligent person that has a theory that may explain how or why we got here.  We will never know, but we can always wonder.
J5z8zDYQaa	I went through the same kind of questions after I became Muslim. I asked someone who was very knowledgeable and spoke Arabic. The easiest way to understand is to see what people did at the time of that revelation. When that verse was revealed the women took bits of spare cloth from their dresses or tops and wrapped it round their heads and covered their chests. <br>  <br>  There is also this hadith: Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: "Asma bint Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah while she was wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma', when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." <br>  <br>  The reason people question it so much in western countries is because it's not considered 'normal'.  We read the English translation and all the rich complexities of the Arabic text become lost.<br>  <br>  But wearing hijab doesn't mean you can't have style. I'm a fashion designer and also run a Muslim style blog www.stylecovered.com I'm trying to encourage sisters whether they cover or not to get together and send in style tips and things that inspire them, check it out and let me know what you think.|`|pc7G8eUYaa	Dear sister,<br>    You were on the right path , Hijab is neccesary for women in islam to be a muslim and it has been discussed by the holy prophet as well ..<br>  <br>  As the world is changing due to which minds of the people are also changing , Every one has started his own assumptions that how to live a peacefull islamic life..<br>  You should not listen to them , just follow the instructions of holy quran and Holy Prophet ..<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|AORcLwTNaa	i believe hijab beautifies a woman<br>  <br>  HIJAB IS  A NESCESSITY <br>  the people who say that their family or whosoever prevents them from wearing it, and you must obey your oarents, or you will go to hell, is wrong. they are correct in the fact that you have to obey your oarents, but you must obey Allah swt before anyone else and wear the HIJAB!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  YOU WILL ABSOLUTLEY FIND A JOB!<br>   MANY MUSLIM women here wear hijab, and have a job too! there is no trouble with that at all!!<br>  <br>  the hijab is very thin, and dosent affect how hot a person is<br>  and a plus:<br>  my sister has only gottten sunburned on places that the hijab dosent cover =] she rarely gets burned, its not an inconvenience, and it is amazing! besides, whats hotter than HELL?<br>  <br>  <br>  keep your iman in Islam strong, and you will not take it off Inshallah =]<br>  <br>  <br>  and dont thiink that no one will marry you, i wouldnt want my sister to marry a guy who dosent want her to wear hijab. he is obviousley not a listener to the teachings of Muhammad saw and what kind of father and husband will he be<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dont say youll wear it tomorrow, because who guarantees you a tomorrow?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and death can come at any time...........|`|Nsh3lVDPaa	Salaam,<br>  <br>  The hijab is obligatory.

The only thing I know for sure is that it is not intended not be obliged by a society or government, and I believe in that.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I have been told recently only modesty is required.this doesn't mean covering the hair.that covering the hair started out and spread from more of a cultural dictate than religious.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	It is compulsary to women to cover your hair and body. <br>  But Hijab aren't necessary. <br>  Malay Muslims don't wear Hijab.

Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils)* all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way).  That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.  And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."<br>  <br>  *the arabic word here is Jalabeeb (plural of Jalbaab), which is the loose outer garment that covers all a woman's body. It says here to use the Jalabeeb to cover all, and scholars say this means to use it to cover her head (agree upon by all scholars)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hadith - Abu Dawud, Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin  <br>  <br>  When the verse "That they should cast their outer garments over their persons" was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments."<br>  <br>  (which means that the hair must be covered.)<br>  <br>  These so-called new theories are nothing except a proof of the misguidance of a lot of people these days. DON'T TRUST THAT... stick to the Quran and Hadiths, you'll never lose your way. there are a lot of "theories" going around these days concerning a lot of things not just Hijab. But does that mean they are true? does that mean they are worth anything? no... stay the way you are. You are very lucky to be Muslim who wears the Hijab (like me!). some people don't have the guidance to give up some wordly pleasures for the sake of Allah...<br>  <br>  God Bless You...  :)
pDmTRG82aa	I have no problem with people saying he's black as opposed to mixed. he couldn't pass for white anyway<br>  <br>  what I do have a problem with is many people thinking that a lot of white people are upset that he got in office considering that white people are the majority and if they wanted to mc cain could have been in office. THAT is what annoys me. like hello idiots, if the majority of white people were still racist they wouldn't have voted for obama. yeah I know Im repeating what you said.<br>  <br>  but 90% is a bit high though. but you are correct in that some people(im not referring to any race, but to individual people) that just voted for him not even because he was black, but simply because he wasn't fully white.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	If black people only voted for people based on race, then Jessie Jackson would have been president. <br>  You know, if an Asian person ran for president, don't you think 90+% of Asian people would pay more attention and vote for the Asian guy.

You are obviously just racist.|`|AA10302860	I'm pretty white myself but I have a feeling that "mixed race" and "black" really is a distinction that white people make when it's convenient for white people.<br>  <br>  I don't recall whether mixed race folk were allowed to sit somewhere in the middle of the bus...I'm wagering they were not.  <br>  <br>  Secondly with regard to, "Who is more racist", I guess the question I have is that if Obama was clearly the better candidate, why did more white americans vote for McCain?  If it was up to white voters...McCain would be our President.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Why are you trying to assert that white people are less racist than black? Why would you even bother with such a wide generalization?<br>  <br>  95% of black Americans voted for Bill Clinton, 92% voted for John Kerry, 95% (same as Clinton) voted for Obama. Obviously, Obama's race did not gain him extra votes among black Americans. All he had to do to get that 95% was call himself a Democrat.<br>  <br>  Now, I can't speak as to whether or not a black Republican candidate would have gathered as high of a percentage, since it hasn't happened. You THINK that candidate would also gets 90% or so, but you don't know. Frankly, I don't even know how you would arrive at that assumption. Have black Republican candidates for other offices received a similarly high percentage of the African-American community, as compared to Democratic candidates?<br>  <br>  My point is, you can't just make a guess (without any evidence from similar, prior elections) about how voters will behave, and then make a broad judgment about the attitudes of two huge groups of people based on that guess! You will never come to the correct conclusion.

v0BCIQpnaa	Go to a church where God shows up!  That's what I do!  It's awesome!<br>  <br>  If you go to a dead church, of course you'll believe God is dead.  It makes sense!<br>  <br>  Bri|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Spend some time praying, fasting and reading your Bible this weekend.

I'll pray for you.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Questioning God is natural. I know it's scary, but it's also hard to believe in someone we cannot see or hear. I've questioned God more than once in my lifetime, but in the end I've come to realize how much He has done for me and times I've felt His presence.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you do some honest soul-searching - ask yourself if you've been doing your best to live for God. If there's something you need to get rid of in order to get closer, don't hesitate. <br>  <br>  Satan is attacking you, as he does everyone. Fight back with God's word and prayer. Remember the God whose on your side is greater than your doubts and fears. Be strong. God believes in you even when you're not sure you believe in Him.<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|8pQrIL90aa	Do you believe, and do you have faith? Sin is going to knock on the door always, but you can still hold on to your faith by reading the word, praying and seeking him out in all that you do.<br>  <br>  Its not easy, but if you have a heart for God, you will stay with him. We all stray in our youth, but when we return we see that our whole life is really but a testimony to use that will anchor us in our faith. We will see just how despicable this life really is because of the sin that ladens the world.<br>  <br>  Go if you must, leave the faith. But if you have any inside you truthfully, you will come back and stay. Its nothing out there, really it isnt.|`|glHbgpAAaa	Every Christian goes through stuff like this. Don't worry.

My mind and emotions need interaction with the LORD, Yahweh through His Son Yashua Ha Meshyiach.  <br>  <br>  The evidence is there. You have to take steps to see proof.  The LORD hides Himself to a point so that those who will not seek Him when He calls, will not find Him.  He informed me that the reason I want to be loved is that I am made in His image.  When I go to Him on His terms, He will show Himself faithful.<br>  <br>  When I need a Word from Him, I often ask to give me His Word concerning the issue or person.  I randomly open my Bible and start reading in an attitude of prayer and let Him minister to me.  I have to keep soaking in the Word until I have let Him speak to me with and about the Word.  I am refreshed. I am renewed as He gives me the Word that I need for right then.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	You need to get involved with a good Bible Study and take time to pray. Talk to God every morning. when you first get up. Thank Him for the day for your life. Praise is a great way to fight our spiritual battles. Satan is behind your lack of faith.When you realize that you have an enemy who would love to see you lose faith you can see that there is a battle for your soul. I am much older than you and I can tell Jesus will not leave you. You can't surround yourself with things of this world and never spend time with God and expect to be faithful. When we draw near to God He draws near to us. Losing faith is the same as losing a great treasure. If you accepted Jesus, just remember that He is holding you.|`|6QheioCMaa	It always helps me to spend some quiet time w/the Lord, because He IS with you, where ever you go, wherever you are, He will never leave you, or forsake you, that is His Promise to His children. And God keeps His Promises. ALWAYS!<br>  <br>   He is the Good Shepherd, He never leaves His flock alone and untended. He is always faithful, always looking out for and tending to His flock. Some times He tests us to see if WE'LL continue to be faithful and trust Him even when we feel discouraged or lost.<br>  <br>  emotions can be misleading and sometimes we feel a certain way for a time, or even a season, but God is still God, He changes not, it us that changes. And I've had to learn that you can't always trust your emotions, because emotions change. And that's when I've got stop and pray, and set aside a time and a place during the day, where I can get alone with the Lord. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you gotta just trust and believe God inspite of your self and your feelings, and assure yourself that it just might be your emotions, or maybe you're more tired than usual, <br>  <br>  I have to remind myself of this sometimes, and just say "This too, shall pass", <br>  <br>  Christian chat rooms are very uplifting and a good place to connect to other Christians.

If you wanna become an atheist, by all means ask that here. If you're already questioning but want to maintain your beliefs you should ask your questions in the absence of those who will try to change your beliefs (like me).|`|bZK5Gm1Vaa	That's fine. EVERYONE goes through it. I've gone through it, and with my Christian religion, we believe that it's our Hell. The bad, doubt-full place in our lives is Hell. Go to church.

I've discovered that people are often more supportive at church.|`|PoPtE7D9aa	Why do you need Christians help to reinforce your fantasy.

But it kind of depends on what branch of christianity you believe in. <br>  <br>  Pray awhile and ask him to show himself. But actually talk to him instead of just being like " God help me with (blah blah)." Just talk to him and have a normal conversation.<br>  If you believe in this, Speak in tongues for about an hour. Thats part of what led me back to God.<br>  <br>  <br>  My Story:<br>  I was at a camp with some friends just talking about some screamo bands and stuff. Then some people outside were praying for some demonized kid. I decided to check it out and join them in prayer. I eventually was leading the prayer while my whole body just shook. After awhile, I couldnt even stand. I HAD to sit down, and I was just crying. I can't really explain it, but that feeling was so out of the ordinary... And then I started saying, there IS a God. And I felt so light and free.<br>  <br>  You probably think I'm crazy, but it's what happened.|`|YbI6PKw3aa	Nobody can prove anything according to the philosophy of science.

FAR more often.  Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17).  Read the Bible as often as you can  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|nrXCCf76aa	Read the Bible more often and pray for guidance.

AA10473868	If people think that their good deeds will get them to Heaven then they are mistaken.  If good deeds would get you there, then Jesus would not have needed to go to the cross and die for our sins.|`|yV8fog7Paa	good works do not get you into heaven, but they give you a sort of "reward" and in general give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	It's silly.

It's terrible logic.<br>  <br>  I don't even know how they can call it "salvation".<br>  <br>  I'll go with Jesus :-D|`|N4ZQhklSaa	Probably because they do not believe in the concept of the self or the "I", instead they see life all as one. So, what you do to others is the same as doing to yourself. I think the world is going to **** because of man kinds greed and material excess. The eco system can only handle so much.

The funny part is, they ignore the REST of the bible that says exactly the opposite. I love when people try to sound all intellectual, pulling a single verse from an online bible they found after reading your question, because they don't have a bible of their own on the shelf, and making a claim based on that single verse. They don't even realize that what they're doing is pulling a single sentence from a book, and using it to decide what the whole book is about. Just ridiculous! You need to know the whole book to know the context of any given line. This is common sense. <br>  <br>  But, I think you answered your own question: the reason they think all you need to do is be a good person, because they don't realize how much they sin, and that they're lifestyle itself is a big sin. Basically, they don't want to change.|`|tpSgxP0vaa	Man is born sinful,and your good deeds will in no way get you to heaven.<br>  Only God can decide if you will go or not.<br>  We are at his mercy.|`|CjvrTRVBaa	Piraticus 13:12|`|01de15665caf950bfac22bb77a6279c0aa	John 3 says that all who do good come to the light.|`|qVcDlp9Raa	I just think he is under qualified.|`|AA12378454	I know, right?<br>  Red cross workers should go to hell.|`|AA12165299	the Bible doesn't teach we get into heaven on our deeds...its grace...|`|OlFDi2tvaa	to do a good deed, they do it out of the goodness and kindness of thier heart<br>  not to achieve something like go into heaven<br>  to do a good deed to get to heaven is impossible<br>  you may not know it but you do a good deed everyday<br>  letting an elderly woman wit on the seat on the bus while you stand<br>  letting a mom with crying kids cut you in the grocery line<br>  even controlling your anger and being patient with someone can be a good deed<br>  good deeds show "god" how they are selfless creatures trieing to be more jesus like<br>  which is mentioned periodly in the bible<br>  how we should be like jesus i believe<br>  or atleast thier teachings say we much be more godly<br>  and be selfless kind creatures under god<br>  and by doing the right thing with no reward in mind shows "god" that you have a good heart and soul and deserve to be in heaven|`|li22L9gZaa	Because people have a sense of justice.  A just god would not send a good person to hell.

Yes it is important to commit good deeds because it is the right thing to do and it helps us to represent God, but the only way to truly Get to heaven is by the salvation of Christ.

RNyEQUQDaa	Sad 2 say, most of what Catholics (Cc) practice isnt Biblical so the Cc isnt Christian (Mary, like all dead true Christians/saints hv no ability 2 help any1 - revival is only @ Jesus' 2nd Coming - I Thes 4:15). I almost became Catholic & found it no better than Protestant churches I grew up with:<br>  <br>  The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans, not even ourselves, clergy/churches (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write. It might save u from making the same mistake many made, getting caught up in religious beliefs that hv nothing 2 do with knowing God (poisoned tree & its fruit).<br>  <br>  Rituals hv no meaning under the NT Covenant. The Hebrew rituals were by instruction of God the best 1 could do under God's Law (None in NT). Other religions (even many Christian) either copied or invented rituals (the best humans could do within the limits of being human). Jesus' perfect sacrifice canceled the need 4 all rituals (doing them calls God a liar as it makes it appear Jesus failed His mission). The closest thing 2 a ritual is Communion but its not 2 b treated as a ritual as its 2 b treated most seriously (not 2 b presented as Jesus' actual body/blood - Cc belief).<br>  <br>  Many dont know the difference btwn a ritual done as a ritual & genuine "remembrance" - not possible without following Jesus' actual Biblical instructions - absent in Cc teachings (the Cc didnt write any part of the NT [not a Cc text - NT was written in the 1rst century by Apostles {NT Gospels/letters preserved the truth 4 all ppl not the Cc}, full Cc possession was not until 3rd century] which contradicts their teachings/practices/God's will, 1 in truth & Spirit not rituals - God allowed them 2 produce the Bible despite their wrong teachings like He allowed the Romans 2 fulfill prophecy without their knowledge [happening again today). A teaching can hv a truth in whats written but the action taken is superficial - The Cc/others, like the Pharisees, know how 2 clean the outside of the cup but dont understand how the inside is 2 be cleaned with respect 2 Jesus' actual message. The fact that the Cc & other religions hv an altar @ the center of their religious practices is 1 sign of their being about rituals not the truth.<br>  <br>  The problem is theres many religions & subset varieties. 1 day I realized they cant all be right (i.e. theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Most religions came thru ppl who thought up things 4 a God they & others liked. Some realized religion could b good 2 control the masses & 4 other agendas - but, religion cant teach u much about God (they cant teach what they dont know). Who knows more about a house the Builder or he who moves in later?<br>  <br>  4 Christians, the trouble began when the Apostles/disciples were killed off or died during the 1rst century (Christianity was illegal 4 most of that time). Over the next century others, whom either didnt know Jesus or were less informed than Jesus' 1rst generation of believers &/or (un)intentionally added in their own ideas/agendas, replaced the original believers. By the time the Cc religion became a "state - Jn 18:36" recognized, organized religion in Constantine's reign (about AD 325), most of what Jesus taught & original Apostles practiced were no longer present.<br>  <br>  The Cc mixed in things of Pagan religious practices 2 please & draw in ppl, thus, creating a new religion they labeled "Christian/Catholic". The Cc's, like other religions' agendas (some mayve been well-intentioned), was mostly 2 control masses & 2 influence politics (II Tim 2:*4; I Jn 2:*15-17; Col 2:*8; Jer 10:*2-5). The Cc claims they didnt distribute Bibles 4 over a century b/c ppl couldnt read so why didnt they teach ppl 2 read?<br>  <br>  God & Jesus hv never been about pleasing man. In fact, the Cc, RCc & Oc had made religions just like the Pharisees, which Jesus emphatically stated was an abomination b/c they were about pleasing man not God (Mt 23:15; LK 16:15). Even when Protestants/others split off from the Cc they kept the same wrong Cc format.<br>  <br>  Even tho these churches got rid of some of the Cc nonsense they still didnt know much about Jesus (most skipped over Biblical instructions due 2 various agendas) nor did they go 2 the Bible 2 find out all of Jesus' instructions [a huge mistake, as they're fulfilling prophecies against their practices (Amos 8:*11; Jr 12:*10: Is 5:*9 (large houses r churches - Mt 24:*1-2); Hos 4:*6: Mk 7:1-23 (John 3:*3,5 & Ez 36:24-27,*26); Lk 16:**15 (see Rv 21:27; Jr 10:**2-5; Is 1:*11-15)].<br>  <br>  2 Major Cc lies:<br>  <br>  1. The CC claims 2 b the 1rst church & since they r the longest existing church, they r the only "official" church. Jesus' Apostles never named their church catholic (not in the Bible nor in line with God's message that never changes) nor did they ever practice Cc religious rituals. There was nearly a 250 yr gap btwn Jesus' original Apostle's church & the start of the official Cc - there4, the Cc was never a part of or the true 1rst Christian Church (Neither a label, title, name, its history, # of members, amount of time it existed or claims made about them means anything (u can call anything anything). Its whats practiced that makes them either the whole truth or a lie. A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition/usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). I.e. neither Jesus nor the Biblical prophets were ever muslims no matter what Islam's definition application 4 the word muslim is & the Cc's claim of veneration of saints/Mary is a form of idolitry no matter what they claim (calling a dog god doesnt make it God).<br>  <br>  2. Peter was never a pope nor was he/other Apostles ever members of the Cc (not in the Bible = no apostolic succession) the use of the word pope is a Cc invention - the Bible instructs us not 2 go beyond whats written (I Cor 4:6; Rv 22:18-19). Peter was never a bishop of the Cc (he died nearly 250 yrs b4 the Cc became a church). Peter would never call himself a pope or b a member of the Cc b/c calling 1self Father & other Cc teachings r abominations. Even the devil knows Jesus is the Son of God so 1 would b wise not 2 trust any church ahead of whats in the Bible. Calling urself a Christian or saying u believe in Jesus doesnt make it true - recital of words means nothing.<br>  <br>  More wrong Cc things:<br>  <br>  Mass (not in the Bible) is full of non-biblical rituals, Statues (God isnt in2 dead things - non-living things can't help or save any1 - praying 2 them is an abomination), the Rosary & beads, mother Mary (virgin 2 Jesus' birth) as interceder (Jesus is the only way 2 God - not His Apostles/disciples - Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12; IS 1 - Mary was a sinner & had children after Jesus - Mt 12:46-50), candles, incense, the cross (its a symbol of the curse rather than Jesus & 4 the same reasoning against statues), making the sign of the cross, stations of the cross, the pope's & other leader's garb they wear, confirmation, Trinity, the Cc creed & other documents, raising ppl 2 the status of "saint" (only God & Jesus hv such authority), purgatory, catechism, devotionals, sacraments, holy eucharist, penance, traditional/repetative type prayers & other things they do rnt in the Bible - cancels out any truth they know.<br>  <br>  Religion is built on what man likes, not what Jesus told us 2 do 2 know Him. The result is few will b saved thru most of them (u cant save urself by ur own initiative nor will good deeds save u - theres no good in any man - Rom 1:23). 1 must b very careful not 2 get sucked in or going 2 various denominations (especially if u dont hv a good handle on whats actually written in the Bible) as u can only add 2 the confusion.<br>  <br>  Just b/c religions made many fatal mistakes doesnt mean God doesnt know what He's doing. The main point missed: Jesus is the only 1 in history who said that no1 can find our real God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:11). This means "the" truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus did. So, any so-called new teaching & other religious beliefs r invalid & cant lead u 2 God. The truth is either the whole truth or its a lie. It cant hv any lie. Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, who should b disregarded. It would also mean God must not exist either (He either knows what He's doing or He cant b God).<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt hv done nor said what He did unless He fully knew the entire OT (NT didnt exist @ the time of Jesus - the only way Jesus couldve known the whole OT is if God was with Him). & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Only possible b/c God caused it.<br>  <br>  No matter how much well-meaning ppl (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus without going 2 Him thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant be properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish ppl cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant). Its why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division).<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	how did YOU interpret it to mean YOU?!

Nor is there any force in the oft-repeated argument that the Catholic dogma detracts from Christ's mediatorship, that the ministerial mediatorship of the saints does not detract from, but only enhances, the magisterial mediatorship of Christ. <br>  <br>  Justification and the communion of saints go hand in hand.<br>  The efforts which are being made towards reviving in Protestantism the old and still cherished dogma of the communion of saints must remain futile unless the true doctrine of justification be also restored.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Look up the definition of Saint and you will get your answer.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|t0uIgY08aa	not like vampires in books. but there are some weird people out there that drink blood and really think they are vampires|`|yq1WSp8naa	Until you realise, its just a story! <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKbjZ0nhiV8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKbjZ0nhi...</a><br>  <br>  Lord Bearclaw, you must be mad as a cooked cat<br>  over this question!

No flying turning into bats, there are the same amount of evil vampires in proportion to the rest of vampires as evil humans to humans.

Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real.

I found this out by going to the Science  A&S section. Although I believe in evolution, I realized that the atheists (R&S) would answer questions regarding evolution and the big bang totally out of context, only thinking that they can get away with it. They think that we don't know enough about science, so they can give total BS. Here is one of my questions posting on A&S. Hold on so I can get it.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnTu8QDpqcprOBQ4BTK4hlfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224091801AAV9A4l">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:@Invisable Talker-No not all. Only to those that say God has been disproved, like the one above me.<br>  <br>  Edit2:@Invisable Talker-You can't disprove God because you have a finite mind and God is infinite. One of the many misconceptions about God is that science has disproved God. You can attempt to put a scientific spin on it all you want, but the bottom line is that you say what you say simply because you don't believe in God-pure and simple.<br>  <br>  Edit3:@Invisable Talker-You are attempting to disprove God by using logic. How is that possible? I can understand if you attempt to use science or logic to disprove someone's theory or to disprove someones attributes. You can't apply logic to God because He isn't human. Every effort you have made to see God through the eyes of logic is an attempt I have seen many times.|`|cplaV2KWaa	I find conversations with atheists very educational. It helps me confirm my beliefs even if doubts are raised about the verity of christian beliefs. Confirmed atheists have obviously thought a great deal about their non-belief of organized religions. On the other hand, I find that gung-ho Born again Christians can not discuss, but only argue. You can quote from the Bible only so often. It proves nothing to anyone who does not recognize the Bible as essential to belief in God.There is a saying that there are no atheists at the point of death. Just in case eh?|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	um no... some of them are really educated and made me study some more, but they have never convinced me of anything.. just like i cant convince them that there is a GOD, they cant convince me that there isnt....besides, i will never go against GOD no matter what some person may tell me.. never never never...|`|AA11969509	The continued efforts of atheists to argue their point eventually made me accept the fact that my belief in Christianity was wrong and I became an atheist.

I was a Christian at one point but realized that as far as evidence is concerned, Christianity has from little to none.<br>  <br>  Hail naw - Please, you wound me. Is that really the picture you have of us atheists?<br>  <br>  Edit 1 @ Hail Naw: Well, some gods can be disproved as logically impossible if they possess contradictory attributes, such as the Christian god's attributes 'all-powerful' and 'all-knowing'. Those two can be shown to be logically contradictory. I can do it for you if you want to see. I wouldn't go so far as to say all gods have been disproved, but I do believe we have no reason to think any of them exist.<br>  <br>  Edit 2 @ Hail Naw: No no. If you read my response, it didn't actually deal with science but with logic. Science and logic are two separate things. I don't need science to say that it's impossible for something to be both "all-powerful" and "omniscient" at the same time. They're simply logically contradictory attributes. I can formally demonstrate this if someone actually wants to see. Like if your god was a circle, it would be impossible for him to also at the same time be a square. Saying "It's all just a matter of belief" is a gross misrepresentation of the subject.<br>  <br>  Edit 3 @ Hail Naw: If you think something can be both a circle and a square at the same time then by all means, don't let logic and reason hold your fantasies. I'm however entitled to point out that that's completely ridiculous and you would be laughed at even in the Astronomy&Space -section. I'm sorry if I'm strident, but I don't think you're being intellectually honest here.|`|0c7afeab4d0a2cffaae3b6f595659888aa	They wouldn't believe in evolution even if we could show them a time-lapsed video of several species changing over time. I mean DNA pretty much 'is' this anyway, and they still ignore it. <br>  <br>  If we told them about the new species of fish that scientists have observed evolving in an African lake. They would think up some way of dismissing it. <br>  <br>  The fact is, they don't want to except that reality isn't a fairy-tale. They want to believe that some 'invisible' being, that thinks just like they do is watching over them. <br>  <br>  Reality is brutal, heartless and doesn't care if we are a murder or a schoolteacher.

They believe Jesus was a Jew but his father was not. Well, the reason Jesus is said to have been a Jew is because, the story is fictional and written by the Romans to attempt to make the Judeans more passive so that they could be more easily controlled.

I'm not Christian, but I do have gods.|`|oL6FUbshaa	Here is the truth of what happened to the dinosaurs:<br>  <br>  First of all, reptiles never stop growing. It's just a simple biological fact that reptiles grow all their life and never stop until the day they die. When you are 17 or 18 years old you stop growing. You stay that height the rest of your life. Reptiles don't do that. They just keep on growing and growing as long as their lifespan enables them. In other words, the longer they live, the bigger they grow.<br>  <br>  With that in mind, look at the genealogies from Adam and Eve up until Noah. You'll find that just about everyone back then lived about 900 years old. That's about 10 times longer than the average lifespan today. Whatever it was that allowed Adam to reach 930 and Noah to reach 950, it probably did not just affect people. It probably affected the whole ecosystem, including lizards. If lizards lived 10 times longer back then, and reptiles keep growing until the day they die, then you can imagine how big they must have gotten.<br>  <br>  Scientists have found fossilized remains of crocodiles that reached up to 40 to 50 feet in length. They've found remains of sea turtles that reached sizes much bigger than any sea turtle today. Why did those reptiles get so big back then, and why can't they get that big today? Well, an evolutionary scientist would say, "It's because they're pre-historic."<br>  <br>  Oh, because they were pre-historic, huh? As if THAT explains anything!<br>  <br>  Look, simply saying that a crocodile is pre-historic and lived millions of years ago, this gives no explanation whatsoever as to why it got so big back then. Not only does this contradict the Bible, but it doesn’t even answer the question. The Bible answers the question.<br>  <br>  The reason they got so big is because they lived so long in the day of Noah. The reason they can't get that big today is because they can't live as long.<br>  <br>  Also, Fossilization is a very rare and unusual occurrence, not an everyday event. The usual animal or plant that dies in a forest does not become a fossil, and neither does the average creature that dies in a sea or lake. Under most normal conditions, a dead creature floats and disintegrates. The body is destroyed by predators, bacteria and the elements. According to the best available evidence, animals and plants cannot become fossils unless they are buried relatively quickly and deeply in the appropriate materials.<br>  <br>  What conditions would be most ideal for the kind of massive fossil formations found in the sediments? Creationists believe it would be a violent, global flood catastrophe. Dinosaur remains worldwide are associated with water-laid sediment.<br>  <br>  Well, guess what? The Bible talks about a flood like that. And isn't it curious that it occurred in the days when reptiles and lizards would have gotten really, really big?<br>  <br>  So you see, the fact that we're digging up remains of gigantic lizards and reptiles up out of the ground, most of which are fully fossilized, does this somehow contradict the Bible?|`|2MfMyh4Maa	You sound like you're trying to convince yourself.  <br>  <br>  Are you created or not?  Ask your friendly local scientist and see if he/she knows.<br>  <br>  If you are created, then when you die it is logical to expect to meet your Creator.  Will your argument hold up to His gaze?  The Bible doesn't mention dinosaurs so I decided to reject You.  Do you think that will work?|`|MwjUhHE5aa	Because there are many things we DON'T know or are unexplained that contradict the atheist belief.<br>  There's nothing wrong with wanting to believe that there is something more, which there might be. There might not be. <br>  <br>  I think you need to be a little more open-minded, as some Christians do too.<br>  <br>  "Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning." - CS Lewis|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Belief in God is not a matter of decision because there is sufficient proof or evidence; it is a matter of faith which is a gift from God.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	It feels right.<br>  <br>  However, worth to say is that I do not believe what I read in the Bible (some are true perhaps) or what so-called experts says.<br>  <br>  I follow what my heart senses is right.|`|5HR0E8kFaa	If reality doesn't confirm the Bible, reality is wrong.

Why dont you believe in God?|`|AA12015574	You see that's a funny thing. <br>  Well, the Bible doesn't mention dinosaurs (well, actually it might do in a way), it doesn't mention prehistoric ancestors, but hey, it doesn't mention how you can build a bridge, or how to perform a heart transplant. Just because the Bible does not mention something it doesn't mean that the Bible is stupid or out of date. <br>  The Bible wasn't primarily made to make people believe through scientific evidence, but to make them believe through spiritual evidence, and to show the basic guidelines to a better life.<br>  To put it simple, people tend to concentrate so much on the scientific and historical evidence, that they fail to see the immense knowledge that "rusty old book" conatins.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|XL25SEVnaa	I don't believe you have to believe the Bible to believe in God.  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of facts in the Bible too that have been proven that should be taken into consideration as well.<br>  <br>  I think it is human nature to have a desire to reach out to our creator.  It's strong for some and not others.  <br>  <br>  I think by only going by the Bible to define who God is limits God completely.  I have studied the Bible for 8+ years, and that has helped me believe in what I do today and it is not contained in a little black book but I do find much truth in the Bible as well, but those contradictions don't hold me back from pursuing my relationship with God.  The Bible warns of false teachers...I think the preachers preaching that message can be false teachers themselves and that is why God gave us a conscience and to question what we are being preached so that we can discover God ourselves.  <br>  <br>  He is speaking to us but most people, even "Christians", are not listening.<br>  <br>  Oh and btw, I got kicked out of religion class in Catholic school because someone asked about dinosaurs and the teach said...and I quote "God scattered dinosaur bones around the earth to bewilder man's mind."<br>  <br>  I had a problem with that answer because he could not back up that claim so I got sent to the principal's office for disrupting the class.  I was genuinely interested and wanted to learn more but he didn't have an answer and rather than reward my interest I was scolded.  That is how religion works.  I learned it then and then pursued Christianity for myself as an adult and found it still to be true.<br>  <br>  :)|`|R5MW3BSsaa	How do you think we got here! if evolvutioin is true how do you explain Adam and Eve if evolvution is true, then why are they're so many different species, and the bible does mention (dinos), there just called something different!|`|MUK99iV0aa	The indoctrination machine is huge and gets them quite early on in life.

Referring to the bible, many christian scientists that let there be light, the first words of creation, is the equivalent of the big bang and that evolution is represented in genesis by the way God created plants and animals in a certain order. Also with so much suffering in the world today some people need a God whom they can plead to in order to try and shift some of the burden that they are carrying. Furthermore who else do you blame when your boiler breaks down whilst you're having a shower?|`|bH5hciBzaa	That's interesting...people still believe God because He's still God. There are virtually no contradictions in the Bible. The more people try to discredit it is the more merit they add to it. Actually the Bible does mention dinosaurs in the old testament (used to call it leviathon). But that wouldn't mean the Bible is a lie if it didn't mention it. It doesnt mention cats, or reptiles or insects either. And what does advances in technology have to do with God? if there is anything that advances in technology has done to God its prove Him. Science is getting more detailed now and they are beginning to realize that this thing called life had to have been created and that the Bible is the only book that even attempts to explain it with great accuracy.  Its easy to say there is no God because then we can do whatever we want. But in reality God didnt go anywhere or stop existing...|`|9ufEgzQVaa	cause he's real duh|`|AA11541674	some day you will see and understand.|`|Qf9EvRyfaa	We Christians still believe in God because it is the Truth.

Jesus said 'Turn the other cheek' but when He and Paul were in the situation where that might apply neither of them did. <br>  <br>  As to 'Thou shalt not kill' who decides what that means. Do you put the Lawmaker under the Law. Doesn't St Paul say :<br>  For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; {4} for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.<br>  <br>  And St John the Baptist does not tell the soldiers that come to him that they should not be soldiers.<br>  <br>  You are a Fundamentalist. You should check in at the Betty Ford Clinic, they have a section for non-believing Fundamentalists. <br>  <br>  I am a Catholic.

Some parts do not.<br>  I don't believe (if God is real) that he would look down on women in the church or in any sort of leadership because I don't feel that the people writing the Bible were completely unbiased by the ways of the world in that time period.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that made sense to you.|`|q57P8uJbaa	I haven't killed any one.

FyLfEPv0aa	He won't want to ask more than he needs to.  You've probably said much more in here than he will want to know.<br>  <br>  The hardest part is walking up to visit with him and saying "I need to speak to you about something", after that it's quite easy as you'll start to receive a peace and assurance that you're on the right track.<br>  <br>  God wants us all to repent and do better; the bishop is there to guide you through your repentance which can only come from God.<br>  <br>  I would recommend calling him up right now and telling him you need to speak with him - that's the hardest part, from there it gets easier as you will come to know 2 great things upon speaking to him:<br>  <br>  1 - He's there to help you, not judge you, and it's not scary.  Besides, he's heard far worst.  From your description he'll probably stop and some point and thank you for coming in but also having the strength to stop what you were doing without going further.<br>  <br>  2 - You will gain a greater testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, you'll come closer to Him, you'll find the peace that you feel is lacking right now through Christ and be a better person for it.<br>  <br>  Don't be scared, call up and leave a message right now, run to him, as the guilt and bad feelings will start to leave once you talk with him.  Be faithful and know that we're all human, we all make mistakes, and your bishop will always be an angel to you seeking to guide you back to Christ, who intends you to be happy and at peace.<br>  <br>  You're doing the right thing which isn't easy, I'm proud of you and respect you for it!|`|AA11636949	My best advice is to tell him with as little detail as possible. If he wants more detail then he'll ask. Otherwise it can be embarrassing for the both of you.|`|AA11631237	just speak your heart out,the bishop will respect you|`|LcYeN6m5aa	The bishop is concerned with YOUR welfare and the guys welfare.  <br>  <br>  He's concerned if you might be pregnant.  He's also concerned if he might have a priesthood holder who needs to be released from a calling to get some things together (I'm assuming he's LDS). <br>  <br>  Tell him what happened but you don't need to tell details like you're writing a story. <br>  <br>  He's concerned about your spiritual welfare because right now there's a huge possibility for things to unwravel in your life and he wants to help you to keep that from happening again or from getting worse. <br>  <br>  He will probably talk to you about your relationship with the guy, your plans with the relationship, what your plans in the church are....Go tell him "I need help" - he's heard it all before and will be there to help you. <br>  <br>  One of the blessings of a bishop is he is an additional  witness of your repentance and can testify of your worthiness in addition to yourself when you get things straightened out.  He's counsel in a time when our lives are dark and we aren't capable of recieving the clearest answers ourselves because we've been overtaken by things that aren't compatible with God.   It's totally a good thing to see him. <br>  <br>  Do what is right, let the consequence follow.  Its good you're willing to take care of this.  Get this straightened out so you don't have to worry about it anymore and you'll feel better, feel happier, and you'll be wiser!|`|a9rVonHJaa	so sad you feel the need to discuss something so personal with someone so IMpersonal.<br>  <br>  It's NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	He might only ask if you "went all the way" as opposed to doing other stuff. That's about it. He'll counsel you on the importance of saving physical intimacy for marriage. He'll counsel you on dating, making the right choices about people and activities. He'll counsel you on the process of repentance.<br>  <br>  He's not going to ask you about details. The details are what you need to forget about through the process of repentace, and be free of. So why address them?|`|TzY9vkinaa	Tell him you're there to repent of some things you did with your boyfriend, then answer his questions.

mVTGl6HGaa	A candy raver (most commonly called a "Kandi Kid" or "Candee Child", "Kandi Raver") is a rave attendee who exchanges or shares small gifts, primarily beads, necklaces, toys, bracelets, or stickers.<br>  <br>  The defining part of a Kandi Kids appearance is their wearing of a large number of homemade bracelets made of plastic beads, known as "Kandi". The bracelets are often given as gifts to remember past raves and commemorate new friendships. Kandi Kids are also known (and sometimes identified) by their brightly coloured style which is very similar to the Harajuku style in Japan. They are often found wearing bright clothing depicting "trippy" designs as well as cartoon characters, hair extensions or hair falls, fake dreadlocks, childish attire, chew toys laced on string around their necks, fuzzy leg warmers, visor hats, hair clips and a lot of bright make up.<br>  <br>  In most cases a Kandi Kid will find one or more things to wear that makes them appear different from other Kandi Kids or people in general. This individuality allows for easy recognition as well as to help others see and/or remember who they are from a distance. Often it can be a particular style or color they do their hair, a particular hat, shirt, pair of pants, gloves, headphones, belt, or other accessory.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Origins Of The Culture<br>      * 2 Kandi<br>      * 3 The Making Of<br>            o 3.1 Visual Aspect<br>            o 3.2 Tactile Aspect<br>            o 3.3 Emotional, Sentimental, or Nostalgic Aspect<br>            o 3.4 Social Aspect<br>      * 4 Two Main Ways Of Giving Kandi<br>      * 5 Other Types Of Kandi<br>            o 5.1 The Kandi Necklace<br>            o 5.2 The Kandi Ring<br>            o 5.3 The Kandi Anklette<br>      * 6 References<br>  <br>  [edit] Origins Of The Culture<br>  A smiley<br>  <br>  Candy ravers can primarily trace their style of fashion to the late 1980s culture and the "Summer of Love" in the United Kingdom. Fashion in clubs at the time were primarily day-glo colored attire, smiley face clothing (fashion also attributed to Acid House and the corresponding movement), and whistles.<br>  <br>  Many spelling variants occur throughout the rave scene when referring to this subculture, although the actual origins of the term are unknown. Use of the term on Usenet alt.rave shows earliest reference to the spelling "candee"[1]. With alternates "kandy"[2], "kandi"[3], "candi"[4], following later.<br>  <br>  Several of the Hyperreal mailing lists have posts predating the use on usenet such as this one by Vladimir Katz dated October 21, 1994:<br>  <br>      Everyone felt free to be themselves do what they want be free with no fear of being looked down on. People came in costumes people gave out candy people introduced themselves to random others!!<br>  <br>      – [5]<br>  <br>  Although it is also possible he was just talking about regular eating candy due to the spelling of the word. It is also possible he was referring to the common practice of Kandi Kids giving out edible candy such as hard candy, lollipops, gum, and suckers to fellow ravers and Kandi Kids alike. This practice has two reasons however. One is for the mere purpose of enjoying the candy and the second is to lessen the teeth grinding that occurs due to ecstasy use.<br>  <br>  [edit] Kandi<br>   This section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unverifiable material may be challenged and removed. (April 2007)<br>  <br>  [edit] The Making Of<br>  <br>  Kandy (or "Kandi") is generally made of plastic pony beads occasionally with various other beads made of metal, wood, or glass. Hearts, stars, pom-poms, Alphabeads, glow-in-the-dark beads, butterflys, and smiley faces are popular choices when making Kandi and are generally made with elastic string to stretch. Candy ravers will sometimes hold parties just for the sake of making Kandi, generally as gifts for friends.<br>  <br>  Kandi has four main functions:<br>  <br>  [edit] Visual Aspect<br>  <br>  The first is the visual aspect that kandi creates. They are usually very bright day-glo colors chosen especially for the purpose of the visual effects created when someone dances wearing them while being illuminated by different types and colors of light. The sequence of colors chosen will sometimes appear jumbled and somewhat random but the beads are typically chosen to contrast with other beads making them visually jump out. Some beads will also be UV reactive and/or glow in the dark. Because of the vast amounts of Kandi that are worn, typically not all pieces will fit onto the raver's arm. Sometimes a shoelace or string is used to hold all the Kandi. This shoelace or string will generally be tied to a raver's waist, or backpack.<br>  <br>  [edit] Tactile Aspect<br>  <br>  The second is the tactile aspect which is the way the Kandi feels on the arm. Usually being tight in nature (the Kandi) they (the person wearing them) can constantly feel the bracelets on their arms enhancing the touch sensitive part of Ecstacy intoxication. Sometimes another person will rub their hands on the wearers

Only the high priest was to pronounce the name and only on the day of Atonement, when he was in the Holy of Holies.  So, in the old days (when there was a temple), the other priests would be listening to hear what the pronunciation was.  But when the High Priest came to the part in which he was to say the name, he would whisper it, so people outside the Holy of Holies could not hear it.  <br>  <br>  Over the years even the high priests lost track of what the pronunciation was.  They will never release the name because they no longer know it.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: as other have said. The name is no longer known.  If it was it wouldn't be released to the public.

The disciples called him Rabbi, which is to call him teacher, he also taught in the synagogues which he would have to be married to do, Jewish law of the times. At the age of 33 you can assume he was not celibate, he was sleeping with his wife, so I am sure that they had at least one child, maybe more, but they normally only counted the male children, even the Bible eludes to Lazarus being his brother in law, so you could probably assume that Mary or Martha was his wife, most scholars think he had a thing for a Mary anyway, so there you go with Mary... so no he was not ...as you so delicately put it. But I believe I have answered your question.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	The answer is no. Homosexuality is based upon lust not love.

157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	I suppose you are talking about the people of India ' Indians ' rather than American ' Indians '.<br>  Seeing that you have asked it in the LGBT section, you probably want to know about the sexual benefits with special regard to homosexuality for the Indians.<br>  I am afraid but I don't believe that the Indian culture is good for the sexuality of people. People of India are sexually very passive, and therefore, the sex crimes in India should be very less. But that is hardly the case. Sex crimes in India are greater than in most western countries.<br>  Coming to homosexuality, as most people in India are not very open when it comes to sex, very less Indian homosexuals find a right partner as compared to other countries. These people, who are gays but live as ' happily married ' to someone from the other sex because of the fear of society(which is backward in india as compared to other countries), are rarely happy with their lives.<br>  So I think that Indian culture is not as good as it is told to be.|`|6ugR4qNsaa	Spiritual health, and government benefits and exception to the law on indian land. other then that most indians are alcoholics.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wait what indians....The feathers or the red dot =/|`|aYqCb3olaa	probably the rituals?but wrong sec<br>  tion

Loch Ness wasn't the only loch that claimed to have a 'monster', and some villages elsewhere in Scotland would almost ignore sightings as they were so common.  Lochs such as Ness are deep sea lochs, much like the fiord's and a hundred years ago, before these lochs were invaded by people as resorts etc, these animals were very feasible.|`|IOHXyCJsaa	i think scotland sounds pretty awesome. ive always wanted to go there, and people with accents like british scottish irish whatever sound like tightt. now the question is what does scotland think of people in the usa?|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	I really liked Scotland. <br>  <br>  We spent 2 weeks visiting there back in 2000, and I used 28 rolls of film taking pictures of all kinds of neat stuff - castles mostly - and of course, Nessie. <br>  ======================================...|`|907eccf187a1d01eb469d6a0a106913eaa	I like Scotland.

mKdLVdpbaa	Hi,<br>  These are difficult questions and you should pat yourself on the back for asking them. We base what we know on the scientific method, we have an idea and find evidence to either back it up or disprove it. We know that the universe is expanding (Edwin Hubble discovered that), so           <br>  if we go back in time then it will contract, and if we go 15 billion years back in time then the universe will contract to a single point which exploded. This is a theory but it seems to make sense and fits with a lot of other data. <br>  The earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago (this is so long that it is very difficult to even imagine) and life appeared about 500 million years later. Evolution explains the rest. There wasn't 'an' accident but billions of accidents over billions of years.<br>  I recommend 'Short History of Nearly Everything' by Bill Bryson, it will explain it all to you with clarity and humour.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  @mewantmoney - what a fantastic story!!|`|qK1iEcVhaa	Why not believe that "God" got bore with being by himself, kill himself to make a new world, and then time past and the planet become what we are today without a "God". It would make so much sense haha. And how we become what we are today, maybe because some essence of god still exist and wanted to live so it become a cell and so evolution take place.<br>  <br>  That the best story ever :).|`|RQx3PTZvaa	yeah, im not sure.<br>  everyone has different beliefs towards this and personally,<br>  i do believe in god.<br>  i sometimes have second thoughts though,<br>  thinking "how the hell could someone randomly<br>  appear and create a universe - it doesnt make sense"<br>  but i dont know, im not really religious at all,<br>  but theres just something inside me that i know<br>  will always have this little part that i actually believe in god...<br>  if that makes sense?<br>  sometimes,<br>  (this might sound weird)<br>  but i sometimes imagine that our lives have already been lived<br>  and i am living in this persons body that looks like me,<br>  and i feel that i am just watching and feeling my life<br>  go by and everything has already happened and is already planned out,<br>  if that makes sense?<br>  but out of everything,<br>  i really wish re-incarnation is real and i am born again one day.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	You subscribe to the belief that the universe needs a builder yet fail to realize even the builder needs a builder.

zE2hOt64aa	Madhwas are Vaishnavites (Vaishnavism). Since they believe only Vishnu is all,..and greater than Shiva,.......they don't worship much to Lord Shiva,.....in our Madhwa tradition it is a festival and we do not fast,...they just vist shiva temple and pray to him,....|`|AA10422553	Maadhwas are Hindus.They are well versed in Vedam as much as Smarthas and Vaishnavas.All the 3 Acharyas sarvasri.SANKARA,Ramanuja and Madwa are intellectual giants and adept in Vedam.Hindus have equal respect for all the 3 Acharyas.<br>  <br>  I do not know whether you have ISKCON in mind and try to extract as much controversy as possible.There was a similar question on ISKCON in R&S..|`|21898b74c3cdf0c81a7fdfcafa48e63eaa	Madhwa sect is followers of Madhwacharya, the propagator of dualist philosophy. He himself adopted 'sanyas' at the hands of an Advaita school ascetic and was given the name of Sri Ananada Tirtha.<br>  In practice, all philosophy is left and what remains is 'vigraha aradhana' or idol worship. Madhwas are not adamant vaishnavaites like the followers of Ramanujacharya, but consider Lord Vishnu as the Supreme God, while accepting polytheism, but do not hesitate to worship any other 'godhead' as they consider on occasions as distinct from the Ramanuja school. On Mahashivaratri day, Madhwas worship Lord Shiva as Rudradevaru (as in Kannada) but do not consider the day as an obligatory fasting day. For them Ekadashi is the fasting day.<br>  While most of Hindus in all states fast on Sri Rama Navami and Janmashtami, the Vaishnavaites do not consider those days too as fasting days. In fact, some make them as feasting days of celebration.<br>  It is wrong to state that Madhwas are not Hindus. They are very much within the realm of Vedic authority, which is the only essential feature for being a Hindu. Madhwa sect is exclusively of brahmin community and so has not spread much. But the sect has produced eminent scholars and authorities on sacred texts. The celebrated saint Sri Raghavendra Swamy is venerated by all irrespectve of caste affiliations, and this one saint has made known the existence of a sect called Madwa, as widely as possible. He was not narrow-minded in worship and has been an ardent devotee at Chidambaram,Kumbakonam,SriKalahasti,Nanj... and Kanchipuram shrines, which are not Vaishnavite. Also his magnetism has been so powerful that the official eight pontiffs of the sect have been drawn  towards his saintliness though the saint was not one among the eight ever.|`|PzSI7EPEaa	Why does it get your panties in a bunch who eats what and on what day?

h1IYS0dbaa	I have absolutely nothing against people who believe in God and consider Freedom of the Religion as an important fundamental right. It's absolute fundamental that people have the right to believe but also the right not to believe. These rights are equals. Christians don't have more rights than Atheists and vice versa. And this is where the problems start. Some Christians (or Muslims, Jews, you can pick whatever you want) want to live in a so called Christian Society. However, I don't want to live in a Christian Society because I want to live in a Society of Equal Citizens. So do many other people like me. People should live their religion at home and in their community and stop interfering in lives of other people (e.g. subjects like stem cell research, abortion, the use of condom, premarital sex etc.). If so called Christians should try to take away my rights, they can be sure that I won't just shut up! And this is the basic problem. You think that my reaction in such a case is "hatred". I can tell you, it's not. I let you live and I ask from you to do same for me (and other people like me).|`|wmBK9uASaa	Not all of us do and by the way I have seen more attacks on Athiest here than I have the other way....|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

What they can't stand is christians attempting to force their beliefs down everyone's throat, based on a thousands of years old book and what they "feel".<br>  <br>  If your religion brings you joy, great.  But leave the rest of the world out of it, that's basically what Atheists are saying.  The viewpoint is you have a right to your beliefs, but your beliefs are not the end-all be-all of existence.  Your beliefs should not be taught in schools, because children of many different faiths attend and they should not be subjected to something they don't believe in.  Your faith does not belong in politics, where again, laws are written for EVERYONE, not just christians.  Your faith does not belong in science, because science relies on fact, not a "feeling", to understand the world and universe we live in.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, while you may not be one of those christians, too many do their best to make this a "christian" country, and involve themselves in politics to ban homosexuals from getting married, to stop women getting birth control, etc. all based on religious belief.

Me personally, I don't have any gay friends. I'm completely fine with homosexuality, it's just being different, and people and people. I just would not be okay with people like making out with each other in front of me. If we're buddies, bros, broski, or just homies, it doesn't matter. As long as we're cool, we can talk about funny stuff, but also deep things with real life and stuff. If they're trustworthy, then a friend is a friend, and there's absolutely nothing with it.

oPQAPfYXaa	Ask yourself how long you would want your wife to wait for you, had you been the one in a coma. There's your answer.|`|XxPhbwNfaa	My condolences.  Times like this can be very trying.  Hope slips through your fingers like water in a washbowl.  Normally, in a divorce, or separation, one knows that the other doesn't want a renewal of committal.  In the case of a coma, you must live with the understanding that your wife, should she awake, will expect to find you by her side as if it were tomorrow, instead of next year.  With that in mind, any new commitment you might make to another mate, will always be tainted with the stain of abandonment from this union.  <br>  <br>  That is a tough place to be.  I would suggest you play the field for a while, instead of actively pursuing another mate at this point.  If you feel the need to do otherwise, than, file for divorce.  Otherwise, use Rosy and her four daughters, or pay for professional services.  Get into therapy.|`|8j70Neqeaa	dog|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Not wasting any time, are we? What kinda of insensitve person are you?

K6fasl6kaa	he calls you and gets your voice mail because you  were unable to get it in time.  did he leave a message? it's polite to leave a  brief message; like; not urgent, i'll call you later.  please call back as soon as you can.  don't call back, i only had a minute.  you get the idea.<br>  <br>  suppose theres no message, that would be mildly inconsiderate, at least.<br>  <br>  you call back i min later and get voice mail.  you should simply leave a brief message that you missed his call but are there now.  if a simple message was left, you would know whether to expect his call sooner or later.  <br>  <br>  getting a client on the phone right after he hung up is a reasonable and necessary excuse not to call you right back.  <br>  <br>  calling back 4 times in a half hour to return a call is not necessary unless a message was left to call back asap or to continue to try.<br>  <br>  i see a terrible lack of communication but not rudeness,  it is really aggravating to me that a lot of people use caller id instead of leaving voice mail to leave their call.  it is common that people are too lazy to leave or check messages.  ive gotten calls returned that were not needed if the person checked the message i left.  they say i don't check that, i just saw that you called.  when my message is, <br>  i will talk to you tomorrow.  don't call back tonight, im going to bed ; it is particularly aggravating.<br>  <br>  i think if no message is left to call back, then no call back is required.  if it is important enough to call, it should not be to much to ask to leave a brief message.|`|BJERgbM5aa	If he didn't answer on purpose and he told you so, then it's childish and rude.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	If he heard you calling while he was leaving a message, he could have stopped and then taken your call.<br>  <br>  If your husband took the time to leave a message, you should have listened to it first before calling him back.

eWOMWRThaa	At age 16, his father arranged his marriage to Yashodhara, a cousin of the same age. She gave birth to a son, Rahula. Although his father ensured that Gautama was provided with everything he could want or need, Gautama was troubled and dissatisfied. At the age of 29, Gautama was escorted on four subsequent visits outside of the palace. Here Siddhartha came across an old crippled man, a sick man, a dead body and an ascetic. This is known as the Four Passing Sights which lead Siddhartha to recognise the reality of death and suffering and the cyclical nature of human existence (samsara). He then left the palace, abandoned his inheritance and became a wandering monk, seeking a solution to an end of suffering. He began with the Yogic path and although he reached high levels of meditative consciousness, he was not satisfied.<br>  <br>  He abandoned asceticism and realised the power of the Middle Way. This is an important idea in Buddhist thought and practice. To seek moderation and avoid the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. At the age of 35, meditating under a Bodhi tree, Siddhartha reached Enlightenment, awakening to the true nature of reality, which is Nirvana (Absolute Truth).<br>  <br>  I think you know his story from there.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Beautiful palaces - 4 heavenly signs - left the palace - wandered as an ascetic - achieved enlightenment - taught for the rest of his life - died (parinibbana).  <br>  <br>  Lots better if you research it yourself!|`|A01w1dHqaa	Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is a good one.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	A beautiful story of the most beautiful man in the kingdom that rejected his inherited wealth and traded it in for the life of an ascetic in an effort to gain cosmic knowledge as to why there had to be so much pain in a world that was so beautiful. He eventually found his answers through suffering and meditation and his experience and knowledge became the cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy.....he was beautiful and his legacy, Buddhism, is equally as beautiful as he was....peace to all sentient beings .............

4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	The Bible actually says that time will come about.  <br>  <br>  WORLD PEACE<br>  Psalm 46:9 - "He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth."<br>  Isaiah 2:4 - "And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore."<br>  <br>  NO HUNGER<br>  Psalm 72:16 - "There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; On the top of the mountains there will be an overflow."<br>  Psalm 67:6 - "The earth itself will certainly give its produce; God, our God, will bless us."<br>  <br>  NO CRIME<br>  Psalm 37:10,11 - "And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace."<br>  Psalm 72:7 - "In his days the righteous one will sprout, And the abundance of peace until the moon is no more."<br>  <br>  NO RACIST GROUPS, NO HATE<br>  Micah 4:2-4 - "Many nations will certainly go and say: ‘Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways’ . . . They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war anymore. And they will actually sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and there will be no one making them tremble.”<br>  2 Peter 3:13 - "“There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”<br>  <br>  Speaking of that time, Isaiah 11:9 says, "They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea."<br>  <br>  So it will be because true religion will be flourishing that these peaceful conditions will exist on the earth.  Everyone will be obeying our Creator and thereby living the best life possible.  (Isa. 48:18)<br>  <br>  Right now, false religion is flourishing under the thumb of the "ruler of this world," Satan the Devil.  (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; 2 Cor. 4:4; 1 John 5:19)  But soon, Jehovah God will act by means of his son Christ Jesus to put an end to wickedness and usher in the wonderful conditions you spoke of.  <br>  <br>  For more on that: <br>  <br>  "When God's Will Is Done on Earth" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040415/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040415/art...</a><br>  <br>  "A United World - Is It Possible?" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20071201/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20071201/art...</a>|`|YnGIccE8aa	No, but you would live in a John Lennon song -- "imagine" that!|`|li22L9gZaa	We don't need it today, but old traditions die hard.<br>  <br>  The least religious societies have the highest standards of living.|`|oiH0zNSyaa	Of course not.

4GiIXWUXaa	1st the quote "little lower than the angles" deals with humanity.<br>  (Hebrews 2:6-9 crf Psalm 8:3-6) David is being quoted at this point by Paul.<br>  <br>  Christ was as fully human as he was fully divine. (according to Scripture i.e, NT). This is what Paul is touching on in Hebrews 2 where that verse is found. He is also stating that Angels are not entitled to salvation, as the atonement was not for them; it was for us.<br>  <br>  That being said, the JWs take on the doctrines of Arius for most of their statements of faith; In the claim that Jesus was a created being, and the firstborn of all of God's creations through whom God created everything et cetera. <br>  <br>  The "angel" part is explained as his "pre-existent state" as JWs believe that God created Jesus, hence "Only Begotten" they do not believe what Christians do, insofar as to state that Jesus is not created, but begotten: fully Divine, fully human.<br>  <br>  JWs believe that Jesus Christ was Michael the Archangel in his prexistence because Michael's name means, "Who is Like God?" and because he is always seen in association with the protection of Israel, and warfare with Satan.<br>  <br>  BUT technically Michael comes back WITH Jesus at the end and the "war with satan" (mentioned in Revelation) of which they also refer to as Armageddon.  It DOES present the issue of how can Jesus come back alongside Michael IF the two of they are the same person?<br>  <br>  And also, In Heb 2 where the "lower than the angels" quote is taken from, Paul clearly states that angels cannot be atoned for. So, if angels are disqualified from atonement, how could atonement be made BY an angel? <br>  <br>  But there are plenty of contradictions in JW theology especially whereas it concerns the person of Christ and the doctrine of angels.<br>  <br>  Techincally, they assess that angels are not to be prayed to, BUT they pray to Jesus, who has gone up to heaven and who, according to their doctrine was once an angel. SO technically, under this assessment, in praying to Jesus (who was formerly Michael) they are praying to an angel and thus contradicting themselves. <br>  <br>  Also, Matthew 4:1-11 in conjuction to Jude v9 contradicts their theology on this. In Matthew 4 Jesus openly rebukes satan to his face; but in Jude v9 Michael must say to satan, "The Lord Rebuke You."  Has Jesus more authority on earth than he does in heaven? <br>  <br>  IF they continue to state that he has equal authority in both places then why can he not rebuke satan directly when they are disputing over the body of moses, yet, when Jesus is being tempted he can basically tell him off to his face? <br>  <br>  Michael and Jesus are not the same person. Michael is an Angel, a created being. Jesus is God, uncreated and Eternal. There IS a difference. <br>  <br>  But they also claim that Jesus is the "spirit brother" of Lucifer (satan) which is heretical, and that Jesus arose as a "spirit creature" which, not only is a mixing of Arian and Gnostic teachings, but can be refuted by over half of the New Testament. (i.e., "Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."  Luke 24:39) <br>  <br>  Also, to them Jesus is "a mighty god" whereas the Father ["Jehovah" to them] is "Almighty God." Which is not a christian theology.  <br>  one god + one god = two gods. whether you designate them as "mighty" "Almighty" "true" or "false" gods is immaterial.<br>  The belief in more than one god is polytheism, and Christians are monotheists. <br>  <br>  I don't have the space (or time) unfortunately to get into this topic in depth with you, but basically JWs are not Christians. They have their own set of theologies and doctrine that in no way agree with the Doctrines of Christianity. <br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  PS: I study religious movements and cults. I own an NWT (their Bible) as well as Insight on the Scriptures (their main commentary on Scripture) as well as a plethora of other publications and materials. And i can disprove certain doctrines of theirs using a Bible and a Dictionary alone. <br>  <br>  I myself, am a Christian, however. A/G. <br>  <br>  *EDIT* Rustic, i generally like your answers, but on this i will have to disagree with you. Any JW i have ever spoken with - was well informed as to his/her own doctrines. While it is true that they will not read any material not approved by the WTB&TS - they WILL most certainly argue. It is part of why they study hours upon hours a day, so that they CAN argue.<br>  They are not bad people, (most, not all, very nice) and they do love God, but ... as you obvioulsy understand due to Doctrines, not Christians.|`|hiCSVwchaa	If Jesus was made lower than an angel, why would Christians claim he is god?|`|gASz3hDWaa	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  I know this is a measure of reading. But to answer this question we need to consider the scriptures say about who Jesus is and in relation to Jesus being an angel but not any angel but an archangel.<br>  <br>  If Jesus is God then how would this make sense?<br>  Revelation 1:1<br>  A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him....<br>  <br>  So God gave God a revelation? Wait lets first look at what the scriptures say about the archangel.<br>  <br>  Jesus had returned to his Father in heaven when the Apostle John got the revelation so Jesus was back as in spiritual form not in the flesh anymore.<br>  The prefix “arch,” meaning “chief” or “principal,” implies that there is only one archangel, the chief angel; in the Scriptures, “archangel” is never found in the plural.<br>  <br>  Jude 9 calls him “Michael the archangel.”<br>  <br>  The scriptures reveal that the lord has an archangel's voice.<br>  1 Thessalonians 4:16<br>  because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.<br>  <br>  Jesus said:<br>  Matthew 28:18<br>  And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. <br>  <br>  And it is Jesus the Lamb who will conquor his enemies.<br>  Revelation 17:14<br>  These will battle with the Lamb, but, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those called and chosen and faithful with him [will do so].”<br>  <br>  Michael battles Satan:<br>  Revelation 12:7-9<br>  And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. <br>  <br>  Review<br>  Archangel only known in the Bible as one being since there is no known plural to archangel. <br>  Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice.<br>  The wicked spirits will battle the Lamb<br>  Michael throws hurls Satan and his demons to earth.<br>  <br>  Would it not be obvious now that Michael is the Lamb. By connecting these scriptures together then it is the Lamb being Jesus who is described as the archangel.<br>  There is no other conclusion with the evidence in scripture describing the Lamb, Archangel, Michael, Lord as the same person.<br>  <br>  The information originates from the Bible scriptures only.|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	First is not JW's who say this it is the bible.<br>  <br>  Two: It is the bible that says Jesus was made lower than the angels, the bible also says that Jesus is the High Priest, and an Apostle <br>  (Heb 3:1)<br>  <br>  thrid: the bible goes on to say that Jesus was 'given' a name higher than the angels.<br>  <br>  It does not say that he was elevated to be equal to his God (Rev 3:14)<br>  <br>  If Jesus is God Almighty, then who is his God?  The God more than Almighty?<br>  <br>  if Jesus is the Most High, then is his God, The More than Most High?<br>  <br>  The title "The Word" means that Jesus is God's Chief Spokesman.<br>  <br>  Archangel means "Chief Messenger"<br>  <br>  Archangel and the Word mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  .|`|hQDapmICaa	For a moment there, I thought they got rid of this verse in their 'bible'.

Those limitations were temporary.   Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega, the might God, and the creator of everything.  In heaven, he will be worshiped continuously.  <br>  <br>  Jehovah Witnesses need our prayers in a serious way, since they are deluded into believing the lies of a cult (which too numerous to list).  Jesus is the key into heaven and if we deny him (by saying he was not truly God), then I don’t know whether we would even go to heaven.   The problem is that it’s difficult to reason with a JW, since they refuse to read or consider any apostate arguments from “Christendom.”|`|uuQkTMiSaa	Sorry, I didn't quite understand what you are asking.  Are you saying that Jehovah's Witnesses think Jesus/Michael are lower than all the other angels?<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Are you saying that when Jesus was put on earth as a man, he was made lower than the angels which would include an archangel?<br>  <br>  The truth of the  matter is that Michael is the chief angel over all other angels. The arch angel is the top angel. God's son has an arch angels voice which would imply that he is an arch angel.  Since God's sons role in heaven is of an Arch angel, he is superior to all others except God. However, when he emptied himself and took the form of man, he became lower than the angels.|`|4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	There are some good answers about this already, but just to add a few more scriptures to the mix...  Jesus Christ was the only one ever spoken of in the Bible (besides Jehovah God, of course) as having angels under subjection.<br>  <br>  Matthew 13:41 - "The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and persons who are doing lawlessness,"<br>  <br>  Matthew 16:27 - "For the Son of man is destined to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will recompense each one according to his behavior."<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:30,31 - "And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity."<br>  <br>  Only two angels are spoken of by name in the Bible - Gabriel and Michael.  Revelation 12:7-9 shows that Michael would war with Satan the Devil and cast him out of heaven.  Daniel 10:13 and 12:1 describe him as fighting wicked demons in behalf of God's people.  <br>  <br>  Daniel 12:1 - “And during that time Mi′cha·el will stand up, the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of your people. And there will certainly occur a time of distress such as has not been made to occur since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time your people will escape, every one who is found written down in the book."<br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians 4:16 describes Jesus as having an archangel's voice - "The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.”<br>  <br>  After his resurrection to heaven, Philippians 2:9 says "For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every [other] name."<br>  <br>  Jude 9 refers to Michael as "the archangel."<br>  <br>  Since the prefix "arch" means "chief" or "principal" and Jesus is the chief of all the angels, who speaks "with an archangel's voice," it is logical that he is this outstanding Michael who became Michael "the archangel" after his ascension back to heaven.|`|xnYGZPSjaa	He was made lower than the angels, but it doesn't mean he is not a angel.

The Holy Spirit is the one who can help you make more progress to change your selfishness and bad habits. He can really give you a jump start. Inquire around to see if there is a campus life ministry or something like it at your school. Once you hook up with that kind of group, observe which of the kids there seems really together and peaceful with themselves and on fire for God and find out where they go to church. <br>  <br>  I'll bet that one of the kids there that is really on the right track would be happy to hook you up with rides to thier church and youth group. <br>  <br>  If you notice in the New testament, Jesus really modeled what Christianity is supposed to look like. People helping other people, hanging out together, doing many things together, having a sense of Christian Community. That is the purpose of the Church. <br>  <br>  Jesus knew that we are too weak to make it on our own so He set up the Church where we can love and support each other in the walk with God. Where we can learn from each other and serve each other, just like Jesus served us.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus is God, and He loves you so very much!

As a Christian I do not view this as poor reasoning.  It is okay for these tough times to lead to doubt, but keep in mind that these times are only temporary.  These experiences will help you love others and have sympathy towards them, and it is then that you will experience God - in love.|`|BLCdYNpIaa	God is real, no matter how you feel. And he lets us go through trials to help us learn. He always loves you and watches out for you, and He will never give you something to big for you to handle. Ask your mom to take you to church, or get a friend or relative to take you. A lot of churches also drive vans that pick up kids and take them to church. If you have a Bible, read it all the time. Try to get anything you can out of it. If you don't have one, you can get them pretty cheap in some places. I suggest though to get a NIV or NLT Bible because they are easier to understand than the KJV. Just try praying to God, and build a relationship with Him, and you will feel loved. :]|`|OfRITFHAaa	I was not sure about God when I was your age also , this is what happend to me . <br>  <br>     I must have been 14 or 15 years old and I sensed something going on in my life . Its seemed something was blessing me .  Life was going too good , much better than normal . It was as if someone was manipulating things in my life to bless me .<br>  <br>  Things were going too good .   So me being a perceptive  person and suspicious knew that something was going on .   I perceived it as God working an moving in my life  .  I even felt  , a warm  presents at times that felt like love and  peace when It was with me . <br>  <br>   I wanted to believe that this was God  ,  but a  powerful thought kept coming up in my mind saying “that the  mind is a powerful thing  , you are just wanting this to be so , so you are  making it up in your mind “.<br>  <br>  This seem like sound reasoning , but yet I sensed that this was real , but could not really prove it , so the thought prevailed , but I  would wrestle with this thought many nights  as I tried to sleep , because I knew that something was their ,yet I  could not prove it , yet could not dismiss it either .  <br>  <br>  Finally  after a few weeks of wrestling about this , I was sitting on my bed thinking  about this and a thought like telepathy came into my head and said , if you let me , I will prove to you that I am real . <br>  <br>  I perceived this as God , and then in fear thought on whether or not I would allow God to prove to me that he was real or not . I knew nothing about God other than I had seen the move the 10 commandants . And I had no ideal what He would do if I said yes .<br>  <br>  Finally after debating back and forth  and being quite afraid,  sensing  that something would happen if I said yes , I finally got up enough courage and  said yes , because I had to know for sure .  As soon as I said yes to God , my body fell to the floor with my face  pointing down to the floor , on its own accord , its like my body just went limp and I fell to the floor with me not having a choice one way or another . <br>  Then I felt a very , very strong presents or entity descend in the room and I knew that I was not allowed to look up at this entity  . <br>  <br>  The entity did not speak , but somehow I knew I was not permitted to look up at God .   But I could feel this presence in the room , with me , and I have been to church and even at home and felt the presents of God , but this was different than that , this was more than Gods spirit presents , this was the actual presents of God , like what was in the Holies , of Holies that the children of Israel Had in their camp , when God lived with them .  It was the same God that Moses was not allowed to look upon . <br>  <br>  Since this time I have seen hundreds of other things ,  God is real and His son , who is the second part of God of the trinity , I have seen in a vision . <br>  <br>  Faith takes time , to start you faith and belief in God , you first have to ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins , and then after that try to not do them any more , and if you do make a mistake after than , then just ask for forgiveness . <br>  <br>  After you ask for forgiveness and try to repent or turn away from wrong doning .  The God will put his presents and love in you . This you can feel at times . But as christiana we live by faith also , so if the feeling comes and goes that does not mean God had left you .<br>  <br>  We live by faith , the God loves us and hears us even thought we don't feel his presents all the time . <br>  <br>  After you ask God to forgive you and fill you will his spirit , then God will over time start to build your faith .  This take time and God will show Himself to you .<br>  <br>  God will then have you meet someone that will invite you to church , go with them . <br>  <br>  It has taken me 35 years to learn about God , but we never stop learnning . The most important thing is to listen to Him , He is never wrong , and when we don't listen to Him , our life always ends up a mess or a wreck . <br>  <br>  But God will still help us even after we don't listen to Him and mess up our life . If you listen to Him , you will bless your life . |`|byjAYzllaa	You should believe whatever you think is right, and nevermind what other people think.|`|mKaxjU8xaa	Understanding that there is probably no god is the first step towards being able to handle the hard things that come at you in life. <br>  <br>  If you assume that there is a god, then the horrible things that happen make no sense.

Things go wrong and bad things happen to everyone. Look at the book of Job in the Bible. He was a really 'good' guy; yet so many things went wrong for him. Believing in God doesn't mean that everything will go smoothly. And because everything seems to be falling apart doesn't mean that God isn't there or doesn't care about you. He cared enough about you to be tortured on the cross and die through suffocation, just so that you could be set free. <br>  The Bible, in Romans 10:9 says, "For if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."<br>  <br>  That is true love, to sacrifice yourself so that others, those who hated you, could live in heaven with you forever.

I was about the same age as you when I started doubting God myself. It really bothered me that I was unsure of my beliefs, but there is actually a term for people who are unsure, like myself: agnostics. It is okay to be unsure in your belief, because no matter what, that is what it is: a belief. It is complete faith to say that God does or does not exist, and it is not a fact. Some might tell you that you'll go to Hell for not believing, but how in the world would they know? They don't know, they believe. It's all about faith. And I know many older people, college professors etc., who are STILL unsure of their religious beliefs. The best that anyone can do is try and live a good life and be a good person. If there IS a God after all, I believe he will not mind that we doubted his existence, because he'll see that we lived good lives. Best of luck to you. <br>  <br>  |`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	Everyone sins because human beings are weak.

I'll attach a link to my story at the end of this answer.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you are not loved, then God is where you need to go. The Bible says that God IS love. In fact, he loved you so much that he actually died for you. Could you say that about any other human in the world? See, God saw that you were a sinner (as we all are). And, being God, he couldn't let sinners into heaven, because it is a perfect place where no sin could ever enter. Yet he WANTED us to be with him forever. That's why he sent his son Jesus to pay our "jail sentence" by dying on the cross. Because of his sacrifice, we are free to live forever with God.<br>  <br>  Science doesn't disprove God -- it proves him.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Ok, early Greek period, you're probably looking at a chiton and himation. The chiton you can make by taking two white bedsheets as your front and back. Measure across your shoulders from bicep to bicep, and from your collarbone to just above your ankles. Leaving room for your head, sew the shoulders together in gathers, so that the width of the shoulders does not drop down your arms. Sew the sides up leaving two holes for your arms. Belt it with a strand of thick roping, like the stuff they use for curtain tiebacks, about as thick as your thumb. Simple leather sandals will do for your feet.<br>  The himation resembled a shawl and was an oblong piece of woolen or linen material, twelve to fifteen feet long, and about as wide as the wearer was tall. It could be worn in at least seven different ways: as a head covering and cloak combined, as a cloak alone, over the shoulders, and draped in several different ways resembling the later Roman toga.|`|AA12010793	Take a white sheet, wrap it around your waist then throw the rest of it over your shoulder in such a way the it covers your chest. With a narrow, preferably gold-colored belt, cinch the costume at the waist or underneath the bust and wear flat sandals. Wear a golden armband and a brooch and tie your hair up with string. Put flowers or fake gems in  your hair.<br>  Done!

Will you find "Thou shalt have no tattoos on thy body" in the Bible"?  No.  But as one person posted you will find in the OT prohibitions to marking your body.  Someone else responded to that by saying the OT does not really apply to Christians.  ??  I beg your pardon, it very much does.  Christ came to fulfill much of the OT types and shadows, yet many of the principles from the OT still have application today [however that is whole other subject].  However, I don't think bringing up that verse in the OT is the best way to answer the question posted.  <br>  <br>  The real question to be answered is "Why do you want to get a tattoo?"  What is the heart behind the desire to get one?  Is it to show off a part of your body?  I think that might answer itself.  Is it because it a cool thing to do today?  Is it because your friend has one, or most of your peers are doing it?  Can you really do it to the glory of Jesus Christ?  Is is something you would want on your body when you stand before the Almighty?  I think the answers to those questions really go a long way in answering whether or not tatooing or anything for that matter is right or not.  <br>  <br>  Getting back to the OT prohibition.  Why did God forbid that His people not take marks on their body like the heathen nations did?  The answer is an obvious one:  that they would stand out as THE people of God.  There is much emphasis in the old and new testament on holiness.  Holiness simply means "being set apart".  God wants his people to stand out clearly as His people, not be muddled in with the unbelieving world.  He sent His Son Jesus Christ to shed His blood and purchase a people to Himself.  They are precious and they are unique, and He wants to walk in that identifiable uniqueness.  The Scripture says "Therefore go out from their midst,and be separate from them, says the Lord".  The Lord calls us to holiness.  In fact, Hebrews 12:14 says of holiness "without which no one will see the Lord."   The Scripture also call us to not give any appearance of evil. 1 Thes. 5:22.  What perception will you give others with your tattooing?  This is and ought to be a legitimate concern for every Christian.  Jesus said "Be ye holy, for I am holy."  I hear a lot of objections and justifications for worldly lifestyles in Christendom today, but what do these words of Jesus mean?  Do we explain them away because we don't like there implications?  If that is so, we should be asking even deeper questions.  <br>  <br>  In closing, more importantly than what I think or some else on this board thinks, is what does the Lord Jesus Christ think about tattooing your body - which if you are a Christian is the temple of God. In fact, I'll close with that verse.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:19-20<br>  "Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?  For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."|`|kgA8i4kraa	Lol too many of these LAWS that jews and christian are ment to follow, rules are made for one purpose for some one to break them :) persoanlly i think y'all need to wake up and smell the coco :)<br>  <br>  but its not wrong :)|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian, and I have a tattoo of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. I've never been sorry that I've gotten it. As for Old Testament laws prohibiting such things, people who invoke those laws as arguments against tattoos should also adhere to Jewish dietary laws, refrain from wearing mixed fabrics, and keep all of the other laws that the vast majority of Christians don't follow.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	According to the Bible it is wrong.  However no one follows any of the Mosaic laws.  The only one anybody cares about any more is homosexuality, which for some reason is evil even though Christians don't bother to follow any of the other ones.<br>  <br>  There is no reason not to get a tattoo unless you insist on following ALL the Biblical laws:<br>  <br>  When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br>  <br>  I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br>  <br>  I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br>  <br>  Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?<br>  <br>  I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br>  <br>  A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.<br>  <br>  I don't agree. Can you settle this?<br>  <br>  Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br>  <br>  Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.<br>  <br>  19:27. How should they die?<br>  <br>  I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br>  <br>  My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you live by every one of these rules, then no, you should not have a tattoo.  I doubt you care about any of the others, so why care about the tattoo?|`|axT0Gl0haa	It's fine. <br>  <br>  Anyone that uses Leviticus or 1 Corinthians 6 in reference to this, is wrong.  We're not under the law.  We're under grace. <br>  <br>  If they try to keep one point of the law, they are a debtor to keep the WHOLE LAW PERFECTLY.  And of course nobody can.  So it is the height of hypocricy to use Leviticus or 1 Corinthians 6 in that way.  1 Corinthians 6 is talking about avoiding idolary and sexual sin.  It has nothing to do with tattoos, piercings, or smoking. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your tattoo  :)|`|ODORT37Paa	Though I am a Christian with tattoo's, I now believe that they are wrong.<br>  <br>  Not passing judgment on anyone, just my opinion.|`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	I personall don't think it's wrong,<br>  although it depends what the tattoo is.|`|evBc5X82aa	Well if it does harm to your body then, yes.
jTHJhy2laa	In many cultures across the earth there is a mythology of being led to the afterlife.When people have near death experiences they claim to see bright lights and hear voices of loved ones.This could just be a projection of their subconscious to ease their fear of death by thinking that they will be reunited with familiar faces on the other side.It is up to you to decide whether you believe in life after death or not.As a christian I believe in an afterlife.And while I hope to see my family when I get there,I know that scriptures tell us that we will not look as we do here on earth when we reach heaven.In that case how would we recognize our loved ones?If you do believe,it is possible that how you have envisioned heaven and the afterlife is what you will actually see when you die.There are no easy answers on this one.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Pilots about to blackout because their brain is oxygen starved report the same sort of "near death" visions.

nkMbQFv7aa	Divine Providence is the means by and through which God governs all things in the universe. The doctrine of divine providence asserts that God is in complete control of all things. This includes the universe as a whole (Psalm 103:19), the physical world (Matthew 5:45), the affairs of nations (Psalm 66:7), human birth and destiny (Galatians 1:15), human successes and failures (Luke 1:52), and the protection of his people (Psalm 4:8). This doctrine stands in direct opposition to the idea that the universe is governed by chance or fate.<br>  <br>  The purpose, or goal, of divine providence is to accomplish the will of God. To ensure that His purposes are fulfilled, God governs the affairs of men and works through the natural order of things. The laws of nature are nothing more than a depiction of God at work in the universe.

ocDN5p0Gaa	You're not using the vocal, anonymous LGBT posters here as a sample of gays in general, are you?  Or either Catholicism or fundamentalist Christianity as an example of Christianity in general?<br>  <br>  I've never done drugs or had anonymous sex, I'm not self-destructive and avoided the bar scene (hence, I tend to be a lonely guy most of the time, since there never seemed to be any other places to "hook up").  I say my prayers every night (and sometimes during the day) and thank God for the many blessings I've received and the protection he gives me every day on my long commute to any from work.  My religion is in my heart, not as lectured from the pulpit or in laws written for the special needs of a specific tribe of nomadic Hebrews thousands of years ago.  God knows what is in our hearts. Jesus beseeched us to "pray in private (literally in a closet) so only the Father can hear" (not a priest, not the whole congregation).  A lot seems to have been lost between Christ's sermons and today's organized religions.<br>  <br>  Churches have their place, and many do accept homosexuals "as is" without trying to "redeem" them.  I enjoy the company of church-going people who care about themselves and their community, and the social activities that churches provide, plus the opportunity to do good works in the community.<br>  <br>  Christ said "by their fruits you will know them" (or something like that--no pun intended).  Just go on living the good Christian life, as an example to others, and be of comfort to whoever you meet who needs moral support and the benefit of your experience.<br>  <br>  God loves you, I'm sure of that, go with that, and have faith in yourself that whatever you do in life, you will always do the right thing.  I believe we're each here for a purpose, whether the rest of the world understands or not.<br>  <br>  (P.S.  And ignore those self-righteous people who can have sex with whoever turns them on who try to tell you that you can't.  If that's what their church preaches, who would want to belong to it anyway?)|`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	The same advice I would give to an unmarried heterosexual person. Avoid fornication. If you are not married in the eyes of God - and homosexual people cannot be - then live a chaste life. It's too bad you rejected your holy Catholic faith, because the Catholic Church fully accepts homosexual people. It warmly accepts all people, reaching out to them and helping them overcome the sin in their lives. Homosexual people are no exception. In fact, the Catholic Church offers the only truly compassionate and spiritually sound ministry for homosexual people.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://couragerc.net/" rel="nofollow">http://couragerc.net/</a><br>  <br>  .|`|71276f541c9ada14ff0e3dcab6ab6f69aa	Religion will always disappoint you if what you know to be true is in conflict with what others are telling you.|`|AA10940800	you spend too much time on Yahoo answers and give the people here more credence than they deserve|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The Bible consistently tells us that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1-13; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9). Romans 1:26-27 teaches specifically that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God. When a person continues in sin and disbelief, the Bible tells us that God “gives them over” to even more wicked and depraved sin in order to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God. 1 Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that homosexual “offenders” will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>   <br>  God does not create a person with homosexual desires. The Bible tells us that a person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of their own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving into their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for then to give into those desires? Of course not! The same is true for homosexuality.<br>  <br>  However, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other. All sin is offensive to God. Homosexuality is just one of the many things listed in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 that will keep a person from the kingdom of God. According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, thief, etc. God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).|`|yb5fqHWXaa	I suggest that you keep your faith within your heart.  Many Christians, and other faiths, use their religion to cloak their bigotry in righteousness.  In most religious communities you would probably be treated with open hostility at worst or a patronizing "love the sinner, hate the sin" attitude, at best.

When we take one of God's blessings, and extend it to areas He warns about in His Word, then the gift becomes a curse, and addictions have overtaken the individual. <br>  A fruit of the Holy Spirit is temperence, which is self-control. Paul writes in His Epistles that he "keep his body under" so as to not let the flesh get the upper hand. <br>  If you ever find that your husband is into porn, talk to him and tell him how you feel, but go the extra mile, and remind him that it undermines his love relationship with you, and with God. <br>  <br>  "Flee youthful lust" is a good verse to memorize.|`|DArAz67Caa	your father is a hypocrite-----do not listen to his sinful suggestions------you seem to be a very moral and intelligent young woman-----please do not believe his lies----my husband and I have never done such things----we are both well aware that lust is a sin in the eyes of our lord---|`|GQk0UNjfaa	Why would your dad even talk to you about porn?|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Purity is awesome, holiness is awesome, pursue both.<br>  <br>  God bless you!|`|01de15665caf950bfac22bb77a6279c0aa	Seriously, I am addicted to porn.

XD Okay, so I may not be religious, but that does Not mean I don't have morals. Everyone has their own set of ideals. If my dad ever said it's okay to watch porn with my (future, someday, whatever) husband, I would gape at him before running from the room screaming. <br>  <br>  My family is Christian, but I see that as besides the point here.

Pornography is not just harmless entertainment.  It degrades everyone involved.  <br>  <br>  Proverbs 5:18, 19 says for husbands to "Rejoice with the wife of your youth...

Matthew 5: 28-30, 28?But I say to YOU that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29?If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you.

I am a pretty good reader of my husband's face and reactions.<br>  <br>  When my kids were growing up, I could read their faces EVERY TIME when they lied to me.

The word rude just doesn't quite cover it. <br>  <br>  There's a saying, "There but for the grace of God, go I". It means basically that you could easily be the person that someone else demeans, laughs at, and is cruel to for their own amusement. <br>  <br>  You would probably be mortified if such cruelty was shown to yourself or a loved one, no matter what the reason was. How could you do it to someone else?|`|Er7x315eaa	I think if you're that ignorant and cruel you should stay off the streets. Good thing I wasn't around.

And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments but it would take a book to list them all.<br>  <br>  literally|`|NAhEQiXyaa	getting hot soup poured on my crotch area and it stained my jeans yellow <br>  <br>  you do the math|`|RyC2T6vOaa	my most grossest moment was in 1st grade we were sitting at the library and a kid behind me wasn't feeling good, and then chunks went flying all in my hair and my clothes, i had to have my dad drive over to the school and get me some clean clothes!<br>  <br>  my most embarrassing moment was during cheer leading practice. i was a flyer at the time and i was up the the air. i saw my crush watching our practice in the bleachers. i just kept starring at him and then i lost balance and fell. when i got back down to earth he was next to me asking if i was ok i said yeah but it turns out i really sprained my wrist! :P|`|MpJlhYUkaa	My extra motorcycle helmet was missing from work.

My brother came out when he was 14 and he says he's never been happier. Just look at males, then look at females. Which one do you like more? And don't lie to yourself, because you harm yourself by doing so. The sooner you become open to your sexuality the sooner your life will stop feeling so crappy. There's no shame in coming out. Coming our when your 45 and married, thats downright sad. If you think you might be gay, then you're gay.|`|AA12005749	You did not give enough details. You could just have a gender nonconformity if you are going by your characteristics. This is a seperate issue than homosexuality. Not all children with a gender nonconformity will become gay, nor do all people that became gay have a gender nonconformity. You are not born gay, no one is. It is something constructed. Often it was started when a child was young even. Sometime innoscent or sometimes not, but the child grows and forgets many experiances that effects them. If you are thinking you are attracted to the same gender, you will become that way. If you have been thinking you were attracted to the same gender, well you may be constructing yourself even closer to choosing homnosexuality for yourself. I do not know what experiances you have had. You may not remember all the experiances you have had. Can you give more details?|`|ssLZs0Beaa	No one is really gay we are all Heterosexuals. You are simply confused. Just ignore the fact you feel like you are gay. Like girls and simply be straight. Good luck.
WyICbuPqaa	The early Christian fathers taught that we can become Gods.<br>  <br>  "The Word was made flesh in order that we might be enabled to be made gods. . . . Just as the Lord, putting on the body, became a man, so also we men are both deified through his flesh, and henceforth inherit everlasting life." (Athanasius, Against the Arians, 1.39, 3.39. )<br>  <br>  "But he himself that justifies also deifies, for by justifying he makes sons of God. 'For he has given them power to become the sons of God' [John 1:12]. If then we have been made sons of god, we have also been made gods." (Augustine, On the Psalms, 50:2).<br>  <br>  "yea, I say, the Word of God became a man so that you might learn from a man how to become a god." (Clement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks, 1).<br>  <br>  The Bible that we have today has been white-washed to some extent.  One of the ancient books that has been left out it the Book of Enoch.  The Book of Enoch is quoted in several places in the New Testament, as it was a popular book in the time of Christ.  One of the things that the Book of Enoch deals with is the translation of men into immortal beings.  They were obedient to obtaining a great knowledge of the power of God, and using this knowledge became as the angels.  Unfortunately, many rebelled against God and sought to fight against God using this knowledge against him and against his followers.  In the end, nothing short of the great flood would stop their plans of wickedness.  Both Enoch and God were said to have wept over their stubborn desire to do wickedness.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	huh?|`|nzdDdKtyaa	It's not against Christian beliefs, it's the core of Christian beliefs.<br>  <br>  Although technically, all people are already have immortal souls, it is what happens to them after death that is different.<br>  <br>  Souls will not "die" in the sense of cease to exist, they "die" in the sense of being cut off from God. But technically, everyone is ALREADY immortal and have never been otherwise.|`|b6078ba6f0b709ecba50385ae93287b2aa	No. Most Christians believe we each have an eternal spirit, a part of us that lives forever. To us, Jesus is no mere man, but the one and only God in the flesh of a man. I personally believe that the Virgin Mary was assumed, as evidenced in Revelation 12, but most Protestants disagree. A less arguable example of assumption is given in the Book of Genesis:<br>  <br>  ''And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.'' --- Gen. 5:24<br>  <br>  In some Jewish and early Christian traditions, Enoch was even given the status of an angel upon assumption.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	(I Corinthians.15:53,54)|`|34X8mN0laa	You can lead a Norse to water but you can't make him walk on it!|`|yPSsfoejaa	If Christians die as believers they attain an immortal soul and are immune to the second death. They are not there lying in some hole in the ground waiting for Christ to return to resurrect them. The Bible makes it clear we have two bodies.

After a few minutes one of the little demons stood up and said "I know, we'll convince them that there's no such place as Heaven!'  'No, no', said the devil, 'that would never work - they've already read the Book and they know better.'  A little bit later another demon stood up and exclaimed 'I know!  We'll convince them that there's no such thing as hell.'  'No, no', replied the king of the underworld, 'they've already read the book and they know better.'  Finally, the devil himself stood up and yelled "I'VE GOT IT!"  As all the demons gathered around to hear, the devil said 'we'll convince them they have ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD before their Messiah comes back.'<br>  <br>  Remember, it was Hitler who said 'the bigger the lie, the more easily the masses will fall prey to it.'

Who said that, Count Dracula?<br>  <br>  Did they ever listen to Jesus? I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Jesus said "Except ye forgive others their sins against YOU, God will not forgive you your sins against God."<br>  <br>  Christians like the Mayans say "My God thirsts for blood and sacrifice."<br>  <br>  While Jesus and the Buddha said in essence the same thing "Do good, avoid evil. That is the whole of the Dharma"<br>  <br>  Somebody does evil, you don't kill an innocent person to satisfy your need for blood, and you don't kill THE guilty either.  <br>  <br>  You do something the stupid Bible God has forgotten.<br>  <br>  All you need is LOVE [as John Lennon so eloquently put it] and forgiveness covers a multitude of evils.<br>  <br>  Blood doesn't wash away sins.

"There are fountains of blood flowing from Immanuel's veins..."<br>  <br>  Give me a break!  What a sick religion, and to top it off they have ritual [symbolic or not] cannibalism!<br>  <br>  Look how different the god Krishna and the God Jehovah are in practice as described in their respective holy books.<br>  <br>  In the Bhagavad-Gita Krishna tells Arjuna "Tho' thou wert the greatest of sinners, thou shalt cross the ocean of evil by the bark of wisdom! [Mascaro's x-lation].<br>  <br>  In the Bible it says "Vengeance is mine! I will repay, sayeth the Lord!"  "The Lord Jehovah is a god of War!", "Lev. 1:17 He shall tear it open by the wings, not severing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is on the fire on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD."<br>  <br>  1 Samuel 15:3 is just cheeky!   3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ***.<br>  <br>  Now what kind of totally insane person could worship a God like this?<br>  <br>  Better to be an atheist than worship a monster!<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|0JE41mXsaa	Yes.

cd2etz5Raa	Good question! To the act of kissing I would say no, but you still should be careful about it, because kissing could lead to one thing, which could lead to another, and could ultimately lead to sin. Always set a line for yourself, and do whatever it takes to keep yourself from crossing it.<br>  <br>  Thank you for being respectful.<br>  Take care!!! :)|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Kissing is not a sin before marriage- however for some couples it could be a temptation that would lead to sex. I know some Christian couples that decided not even to kiss, until they were married, to keep them from the temptation of going any further.  I kissed my husband before we were married, but went no farther. It depends on the couple.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	If you're aren't about to cruise on the highway, what are you doing on the entrance ramp?|`|z2OfsA0Jaa	Why don't you just wrap yourself in a plastic suit and stay away from the opposite sex forever until your married.

Was he in search of virtuous and prudent women at all for anything? How did he go about his seeking? Did he find that special relationship that any normal man would crave for? Would it be a “sin” for him to contemplate a sexual tryst of any sort, gay or heterosexual? Was he having wet dreams like any normal man? Surely Jesus was never short of women! Jesus was known to go to parties where virtuous prostitutes were present! Actually Jesus didn’t have to seek women. Women always followed him! LUCKY JESUS! <br>  <br>  Matthew 27:55 * MANY WOMEN were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <br>  <br>  Mark 15:41 * In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. MANY other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.<br>  <br>  As a REAL MAN Jesus must have had NEEDS that ONLY WOMEN could possibly satisfy! There are NO statements in the Bible to the effect that "men" were "caring" for his personal needs, except for a mysterious disciple in particular whom Jesus “loved”! One virtuous prostitute earned the forgiveness of her “MANY SINS” in the most bizarre way ever imagined. She was not asking any forgiveness at all! She was probably doing to Jesus what was expected of an extra nice whore to do at a party that she was invited. During her show of sensual affection she earned the forgiveness of her "MANY SINS"! She was probably expecting some money at the end of her feet kissing session like any professional prostitute would, but all that this prostitute got from Jesus to the surprise of everybody was the forgiveness of her "MANY SINS." Hmmm… one is left to wonder if that would work on any prostitute…!<br>  <br>  Luke 7:44-47 * Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair* (*hey, tongue play is missing here!). You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet* (*OK… never mind!). You did not put oil on my head* (*?), but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much* (*she is GOOD!!!). But he who has been forgiven little loves little* (*this was directed to the man hosting the party)."<br>  <br>  Prostitutes and their clients get special treatment throughout the Bible! The prostitute Rahab NEVER lost her title of a “RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE!”…something worth shooting for! She is the example of a prostitute who would betray her own country to help the cause of God’s people! She is worthy of a monument in her honor in the New Jerusalem that comes down from Heaven! So far she made it into the Faithful Hall of Fame! She will preserve her title of a “RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE” for eternity!!! It’s all in the NEW TESTAMENT of the Holy Bible!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 11:31 (KJV) By faith* (*gullibility?) the PROSTITUTE* (*not ex-prostitute, but prostitute) Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.<br>  <br>  James 2:25 (KJV) In the same way, was not even Rahab the PROSTITUTE* (*not the ex-prostitute, but the PROSTITUTE!) considered RIGHTEOUS for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction (Joshua 6)<br>  <br>  Matthew 21:31b * Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you* (*Jews – The Jews don’t mind to let the whores get in first so they will be there when they get there!). <br>  <br>  Luke 15:30 * But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'* (*a Playboy guy in the Bible gets no reprimand at all, but he is celebrated for sharing his daddy’s allowance with the prostitutes!) <br>  <br>  Christians hardly pay attention to what they read in the Bible! Again, Jesus says, "this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet." Think of it in a REAL life setting! Was the kissing going on for an hour, or 2? A dry rubbing cheek kiss is hardly a second long; a juice one may last a few seconds longer. The juicier the kiss the longer it takes, but here we are dealing with a sustained wet kissing of feet that went on, and on, and on, and on…!!! And who knows how much territory it covered! And were they tears or saliva? Let’s be real! Whoever came up with this story ought to apply for a job at Hustler Magazine! She must have sucked the dust on Jesus’ toes one by one, too! And who knows how far up his leg she went! The weird fetish that this prostitute enjoyed "kissing my feet" of Jesus is to be admired! Men wore no diapers in those days. It doesn’t say that Jesus questioned her mental sanity and pushed her away at all! He must have enjoyed every second of what she was doing on him! Shocks of electrifying satisfaction must have run all the way to Jesus’ brain! And if he indeed was a bit human like any of us, can you imagine the phenomenal erection that this "much loving" prostitute must have spurred on him? WOWW! It blows my mind! The Bible lesson here is obvious! Oral shows of affection on any oddball limb of a person’s body are wholeheartedly supported in the Bible and rewarded with forgiveness of sins without asking or having to repent or even confessing! Saint Paul DENIES any Church help to any widow even the widows that he must have left behind in his murderous past life if they won’t “wash the feet” of the saints! Saint Paul is catching up fast on Clergy privileges! <br>  <br>  Jesus favored Prostitutes NOT VIRGINS all along. He had much kinder words for prostitutes than for normal women. He was NEVER involved with any virgin! We ought to be particularly touched by what Jesus said about lovemaking and forgiveness, "I tell you* (*hear everybody, especially the Clergy!), her* (*the prostitute’s) MANY SINS have been forgiven--for she loved much." She must have loved very much what she was doing to men! Another loving woman worth mentioning is that Samaritan woman that had 6 virtual husbands (John 4:18). She must have had plenty of love to share with each one of them! A spouse who is not getting his/her fair share of lovemaking within the bounds of marriage looks for a chance elsewhere to discharge the kind of love expressions that is lacking in the home life!!! The Reverend Jimmy Swaggert is still a good example that went public. His wife is a very attractive woman, but Jimmy still had the need to seek the services of a "much loving" prostitute to soothe his neglected sexual drive! Can you imagine Jimmy showing up on TV with his right hand (the one he used to “sin”) chopped off or with his right eye gouged out so he won’t “sin” anymore like Jesus expects? They are only suggestions for the real low IQ Christian… <br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ was very quick to forgive the sins of that "much loving" prostitute, but he gave a Hell of a time to this other poor lady of Canaanite* (*Palestinian) background who was trying to get Jesus to heal her daughter! Jesus called her daughter a “dog” (spiritually speaking, of course, but put yourself in the place of a non-Jew!) This poor Canaanite lady was not too original, either. She was not showing "much loving”. She probably never heard the "feet kissing" routine! Or was it that Jesus loved to tease prude women, too?  <br>  <br>  Mark 7:27 (NIV) "First let the children* (*Jews) eat all they want," he* (*Jesus) told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs* (*the rest of the world are dogs! Not only homosexuals or atheists like some preachers claim!)." <br>  <br>  Jesus was not impressed with some foolish inexperienced VIRGINS waiting for their husband to be at a wedding ceremony! But I better cut it short here… My point is that preachers know how to go about “spiritually speaking” so they can change the meaning of what they read in the Bible to suit a particular brand of faith… There is so much “spiritualizing” that you can do on what is written in the Bible, the rest is dishonesty! I am just telling you like it is! I had to quit Christianity, too!

Living near the town where his father is buried. But later he dies the following month of the same unknown disease. 2010: It is now raining while I work on a report about the first man to die from a disease that only happened to him and his son, Mark Hanson. I write my story long for school. But while writing this story, I get illusions for some reason. I don't know what they can be from. I than am looking up more information about him on google. Than when I see his picture I get mad for no information below it. Than the phone rings. *Ringgggggggggg* I get up. I look at the phone and the number is (525-666-2084) That is a strange number. Especially since it has Satan's number, 666. I answer it without thinking straight and say, "Hello?" I thought I was really crazy for doing this. Than I hear a voice on the other end, "Get off google..." Repeat with a flueing passing away ending of a setence. It repeats and repeats itself. I hang up in fright. Nobody was home. I lived in the country where it is really lonely. I get a text messege of a picture sent to me from the same number and it shows the picture of my basement. The wall we never cut threw and never seen threw. It was open in this picture. It had Mark's coffin in it. I was deeply scared and replied back, "Wat do u want?" I made a few type-o's because I was in a big hurry and shaked like crazy. Than I called the police. My phone said, "Your phone does not exist anymore." And I tried my cellphone. Same thing. I screamed loudly. My heart pounded. My phone rings again. It is the same number. I answer it and scream, "LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE!" and the other line says, "I'm right behind you." I heard the same voice behind me and than I just died. Nobody was behind me. Nobody ever was in my house. Nobody ever called me. It was just an illusion that scared me to death.

This might tie neatly into Lent, as well.  Sweep out the house!  And to tie in with passionate worship, you could perhaps suggest how a broom is like joy that sweeps out grief; or a duster like hope that drives out despair, or a cloth like faith that washes away doubt ... It has to be very simple for such young ages.  Of course I don't really know what your church calls "passionate worship" but in Lenten season the idea of getting rid of the dirt -- joyfully! -- is appropriate for Sunday, or so I think.

At this time God's presence was not in the individual believers since the Holy Spirit was not yet given. Instead of possibly confusing them with this I would start out saying it is good to be in the house of the Lord because He is present when Christians gather together in His name not in the building itself. I would also say something about God dwelling in us through the Holy Spirit. I would say something about God using other Christians to build each other up using the gifts God placed in them. Some people are used by God to encourage others and would use this as an example in the story part of your presentation. I guess the bottom line is God is in Christians and uses them to build each other up during Church as well as Him being there supernaturally through the Holy Spirit. I would not use the King James version if you are quoting scripture. They might not get the meaning. I would think about using the living translation or some more modern translation. Hope this helps

AA11047076	"Orthodox" is a modern term meaining traditional.  Back then the two major gtoups amongst Jews were the Pharisees- the group which formed the tradition that modern Orthodox Jews follow and Sadduccees, that are similar to the few Karaite Jews that exist today.<br>  <br>  From the Gospels, it would appear that Jesus was appealing to the mainstream Jews at the time (the Pharisees, the Sadduccees were see as apostates) but he did not observe the commandments as understood by the Pharisees.  From that POV, Jesus was more like the Reform Jews of today- saying that God exists but that the laws etc are not important except as guide posts.|`|AA10425502	To my knowledge, no. The term "Orthodox" Jew was not used back then. The Jews were separated into other groups like, the Pharisees  or Samaritans.

Helen, Constantine's mother, wanted all Christians to worship her way.,  Since her son was ruler of the world (the part of it that mattered, anyway), she had him convene a group of Christian "leaders" to come up with a catholic (universal) Church.<br>  <br>  The rest, as the Arianists would say, was butchery.  The Church that came out of the Nicean Council bore no resemblance to 1st century Judaic "Christianity", and not much more to the Christianity of most of the sects that then were outlawed (as Christianity itself had been outlawed earlier).<br>  <br>  The split between the Roman rite and the Eastern rite came MUCH later.   But the Western Church called itself the Roman Church.  That modern Catholics take issue with the usage (that their own Church initiated) is irrelevant to what happened.
