8vWwX8SXaa	Well, there are ways, I am thinking right now...  Webcams can be set up to a software that has motion sensors, but you have a digital camera...    The only choice left, without you having to buy a lot of extra stuff (timed button presser, or a camera with face and smile detection tech_ is to   mount the camera on a tripod and let guests press ONLY the capture button... Set a capture timer from 2~10 seconds

AA10657675	The web technology can be partitioned in two phases:     1) Web Designing  2) Web Development    Both phases are quite different and neccessary for any website.    In Web Design phase, the look and designs of the pages are prepared. This contains the coding for the user interface of the whole web site. for Web Designing HTML and CSS is used. Web designing is easier to understand and many tutorials available on internet. But http://www.w3schools.com is very good web site where you can get easier tutorials for HTML, CSS and almost all the web technologies.    In Web Development phase, scripting languages like JavaScript, VBScript, PHP etc. are used. To understand web development it is neccessary to be aware about web server technology.    A typical web site contains two types of pages: 1) Static 2) Dynamic.     Static page is simple HTML page which is directly passed from the web server when requested.     Dynamic pages may contain the scripts. The scripts are also for two types: 1) Server side script and 2) Client Site Script.    Server Side Scripts are executed on the web server from where the web site has been launched. The Client Side Scripts are executed on your computer from where you are requesting a web site or a web page.    To understand what is web server and how it works visit the following link:    http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-se...|`|93f34ecaa8c208e4884bfd015bffa2e4aa	Web designing is designing web pages with HTML, PHP, CSS and all those other languages.

Simply deleting things doesn't necessarily remove all the files and entries for the program, (and frequently you're only deleting the icon or shortcut.)     In your situation, I recommend that you reinstall AVG and then uninstall it properly.

AA11305664	You won't get a cheap razr without agreeing to a service plan. Sorry, not going to happen. If you already have a cell phone provider and your agreement is ending, you can either sign on with the same provider or find a new one and get one for free. But most of these require a two-year agreement. The razrs are too new for you to find a used razr (and used cell phones aren't that reliable anyhow), and retailers aren't going to sell you a brand new razr without having you sign a contract. The only reason they sell any phones cheaply with rebates is because the retailer is compensated for the insanely cheap price by the phone company when they sign someone. Also, a note of caution: I have the razr, and although it's nice and slim, it also gets horrible reception. I've had to end calls with people more than once because they couldn't understand me, even though I had four bars. I've heard similar complaints from others.|`|242bc68887ebc240fb694218923dffceaa	you can't without an agreement. Your best bet is ebay but I don't trust ebay.|`|AA10183285	a crack head =]]

rNA6x4r2aa	all your static variable problems stem thus: Static methods use no instance variables of any object of the class they are defined in. If you define a method to be static, you will be given a rude message by the compiler if you try to access any instance variables. You can access static variables, but except for constants, this is unusual. Static methods typically take all they data from parameters and compute something from those parameters, with no reference to variables.    Either declare all your variables to be static, or remove static for those methods.    "newAccount = newAccount.getAcctNum();" will not work because "newAccount" is a double as declared in the beginning. You can't get the account number, because it is not actually an account object.    close acct2; - there is no 'close' method unless you define one, and you must have the "()" as well.    "return newAccount;" - the method is returning an Account object, yet newAccount is a double, which won't work.    Would this work for you?  public Account AccountConsolidate(Account acct1, Account acct2)  {  newAccount = acct1.getBalance() + acct2.getBalance();  close(acct2);  return new Account(newAccount, acct1.getName(), acct1.getAcctNum());  }|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	The variable must be static if you access it in a static function. A static class method can't access instance variables by default. There's only one copy for all instances of the object. By accessing instance variables in a static method, you are binding it to an instance and that is contradictory.|`|3KyyIELLaa	The problem is the variable newAccount.   You declared it as a double non-static variable:  private double newAccount;  But you treat it like a Account: newAccount.getAcctNum();.  I don't understand what newAccount is for.  I recommend removing the variable newAccount all together.  I would rewrite AccountConsolidate all together; it doesn't make sense what you are trying to do with it now.   What should the new account number be for the consolidated account?  I would write it like this:     public static Account AccountConsolidate(Account acct1, Account acct2, String newname, long newnumber)  {  // Make a new account the combined money of acct1 and acct2  Account newAccount = new Account(acct1.getBalance()+acct2.getBala... newname, newnumber);    // Zero out the accounts  acct1.withdraw(acct1.getBalance);  acct2.withdraw(acct2.getBalance);    // Delete them  acct1.close();  acct2.close();    return newAccount;  }    Hope it helps|`|AA10529146	Your Account Consolidate function  "public static Account AccountConsolidate(Account acct1, Account acct2)" should not be a method for any account. I would think that a consolidated account would be a new account altogether with the combined data from each account passed to the constructor of the consolidated account. This is more of a "bank administrator" function over and above simple withdraw and deposit and get balance transactions.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	yeah, the typing is really confused on that NewAccount variable. It's declared as a double, but you try to stuff a balance into it (correct), an account number into it (not correct, acct num is an int) and then you try to return it as type Account. So the design isn't quite thought through. The other answers covered the static context issue.    I think the close problem is that the close method was not invoked with parentheses, and I think Java thinks you are trying to declare a variable named acct2 of type close. So change that line to: close( acct2); But also, that method is not defined with a parameter of type Account, so you'll need to add that.     One final thought, I like to return status from a function, and use parameters to pass stuff in and out. So the close function could return success or failure of the close. And all of the other functions could too. Probably not necessary for a school project, but definitely necessary in production code. For example, a lot of things can go wrong in the consolidation method. Status returned could include:     1. if one of the accounts has a negative balance, there may be a bank policy against consolidating those.  2. there may be some problem creating a new account  3. there may be a problem closing the old account  4. complete success  5. partial failure and unaable to roll back the part that succeeded.  6. etc.|`|75nbESJUaa	I think what we are missing here is a class Bank (or Checking or whatever) Bank creates accounts for customers.    If you truly want method()s, encapsulated variable names, states of on/off, true/false you WILL use the constructor of your class.    How do I use a constructor? With the keyword 'new'.    So, class Bank is static, if need be. It doesn't have to be. Bank has the main(); Bank has a collection of Accounts. That collection is either an array Account accounts[] or an ArrayList. Every time you need another Account with incredible functionality, you make one in Bank class:  account[ x ] = new Account("Charlie", 13.71);

Keep in mind asp.net is not a language.  It merely allows you to use any .net langauge you want for web development.  http://www.dotnetpowered.com/languages.a... shows athe 50+ supported languages you can use in asp.net  including PHP and Java    ASP.NET does have awesome free visual studio editors.    I work in an environment that uses both JAVA and asp.net (along with other languages) but the asp.net is only for web based and the JAVA is application based.    There are many reasons why one might sound better than the other - your skills and needs are what would mandate what you want to use.

AA10571824	As the person above mentioned, MySQL is 100% free, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    I don't know exactly how to make the windows username/password prompt appear,and I doubt it's doable in PHP, but the functionality you want certainly is.  It is relatively simple (although it requires a fair amount of practice) to build a functioning system that allows users to register, store their information in a database (like MySQL), and then be able to log in and out of secure pages.  The scope of the problem is a bit hefty for this forum, so I would recommend the book PHP and MySQL For Dummies, which is the text I used to learn this same skill.  I found it extremely helpful for learning this aspect of PHP programming.  If you have a small amount of PHP background (which I assume from your question), you should be able to read it quickly as well as use it to build the sort of tool you are looking for.|`|93f34ecaa8c208e4884bfd015bffa2e4aa	Whoever told you that MySQL is expensive, with all due respect, is a complete moron.

Abgesehen vom Alter gibt es zwei Hauptunterscheidungsmerkmale:   - der T-Bred Kern besitzt nur einen 256KB gro?en "L2-Cache" (Barton: 512 KB), d.h. der Barton-Prozessor bietet einen gr??eren Zwischenspeicher und ist somit auch schneller/effizienter als vergleichbare T-Bred Prozessoren   - der T-Bred Prozessor hat nur einen Frontside Bus von 133 Mhz (T-Bred A = 1500+ bis 2200+), d.h. optimal fr DDR 266 Speicher (e.g.: MB-Ram), bzw. 166 Mhz (T-Bred B = 2200+ bis 2600+), d.h. optimal fr DDR 333 Speicher (e.g. MB Ram),   w?hrend dessen, ein Athlon XP Prozessor mit Barton-Kern einen Frontside Bus von 200 Mhz (bzw. 2500XP+ bis 2800 XP+ mit nur 166 Mhz), d.h. optimal fr DDR 400 Speicher (e.g. MB Ram) besitzt,    in Verbindung mit dem gr??eren L2-Cache, ist es so m?glich bei gleicher Taktfrequenz mehr Leistung zu erzeugen, wodurch die Modelle 2800 XP+ bis 3200 XP+ erst erm?glicht wurden    Die alten T-Bred Chips sind somit langsamer und wurden sp?ter durch Thorton-Kerne ersetzt, diese sind mit den Barton-Kernen identisch, abgesehen davon, dass sie nur die H?lfte des L2-Caches besitzen (D.h. 256KB)

AA10551195	Because a trojan is not a virus. Ad-Aware is meant to find all kinds of adware, malware, spyware, etc., into which categories a trojan falls. Personally I don't like Norton, but that's not the issue here. Norton will find viruses if you get them on your computer, and Ad-Aware won't. Ad-Aware will find the trojans, etc., and Norton won't. Use them both!|`|fdgCPDLlaa	Well, the easy answer is that Norton sucks.  Dump it and get something good like AVG.  But I digress.    Probably the reason that Norton didn't find something that Ad-Aware did find is because it is not a virus...it is spyware.  Ad-Aware scans for spyware and Norton scans for viruses and both operate from a database of known offenders in each catagory. A list of viruses generally would not include spyware, and vice-versa.  Your "trojan downloader" must be considered spyware and not a virus.|`|bc75c3fa1e17c4863024efbbbfc7f1eaaa	trojan downloader are usually termed as spyware or malware and that is the reason someone versions of norton and other anti virus do not detect them   http://www.viruslist.com/en/virusesdescr...|`|f19a53200baa3c574d45a70780d950ecaa	norton has bad reviews all over the internet..it fails to catch a lot of viruses/trojans then it fails to delete them. you should get rid of it. it is hard on your RAM and slows down your computer. there are many other alternatives that cost less and work better. i use avast! and it is amazing|`|AA11255292	You are comparing Apples to Oranges. One is a Virus detector and the other is a Spyware detector.    Trojans are not viruses or spyware. Trojans are a seperate form of malware used to download and install viruses, spyware, adware etc.    Since AdAware was designed as an adware removing specialist, and most adware is downloaded by Trojans, AdAware is a pretty good Trojan detector and remover.|`|jTjbWDLYaa	Norton probably didn't have it in it's database. I wouldn't worry to much about it.|`|iRrQpbjtaa	this happened to me also, and the best answer i found was that this type of trojan is actually made of adware/spyware components . so therefore it goes on detected by most anti virus programs until the problem gets worse. so now i scan with both programs regularly.  hope it helps.|`|93f34ecaa8c208e4884bfd015bffa2e4aa	Ad-Aware looks for different things than a virus scanner would.  It specifically looks for Adware, which is what causes pop-ups.  Norton searches for viruses, etc, which are programs that destroy your computer.    Also, they could have different definitions and databases from which they draw the information to find Trojans, which are more like Adware than viruses

Lots of them come bundled with toolbars and things like that now.    Some free programs put them in, so they can get paid for letting you have a program for free. Others are less scrupulous and sneak them onto your computer, often illegally.    If you are lucky, it will be from a reputable company and if you go to Add/Remove programs, you can delete just the toolbar from there.    Good luck!

TRLRsNwWaa	Yes Absolutely!    Your IP address is a very public piece of information. It is given out to every website you visit and is in the "header" of every e-mail you send.    Think of it as putting you house address on a letter or bill. The companies need it to help identify you, but it doesn't help them break in, because you still have all the locks and bolts on all the Doors and windows.    Same with your computer - You gave them only the way to identify your computer from all the others connected to them, NOT the keys to anything!    Not only that, but you even know it is a real company person you spoke to, since you called them, not just some strange call "claiming" to be your ISP. That makes doubly sure you are safe!    Rest easy, I don't think you have done anything wrong at all, nor have you compromised any security at all!    Best wishes!|`|83574cd8bfcda3e5cd5d3685577441bdaa	Yes|`|KgoOJqXFaa	If it is actually a DSL representative then yes.|`|8db722eb9e981b8129a00087330d77c4aa	Yes. And since you called them, you aren't providing details to an unkown caller.|`|b468721496d9009cfa64b2920eed62b3aa	The tech ppl of the DSL provider might need it to solve your problem, so yes. Sometimes IP numbers that are generated by the system are bogus and won't let you connect. They can usually tell from the IP number if it's a valid one or not.   Besides, if you're not online, your IP won't have any meaning anyway. So, if you're talking to the ppl from the DSL provider, it should be fine.     Also, even if someone gets your IP address, you can just put up a good firewall and some P2P protection software and you should be just fine.
TRLRsNwWaa	Yes.    You will need to look at the FULL header.    You will need to change your options in Yahoo if the e-mail is on Yahoo, to include the full header information. Then view the e-mail again and it will give the IP under "X-Originating-IP:".    If it is Outlook Express, not a web-mail like Yahoo, then you will need to right-click the subject of the e-mail and then left-click on "Properties".  Left-click on the "Details" tab and it should be listed under "Received: from".    I hope this helps a little?!|`|DNeuIUJsaa	Right click on the email click properties click the details tab it'll give you the email address and the IP address together by where it say received|`|cc078fff6c71a7de698422cd37e938d7aa	you can find out by checking the "header" information of the email
TRLRsNwWaa	You will need to read the manual for your motherboard to set it up so that it runs the clock at the right speed for you new processor.    You may also need to set the speed for the memory as well.    Some motherboards need little jumpers to be plugged into the right positions for this, while some others are done through software. With you not gettng anything, it looks like yours will need jumpers setting.    Best wishes!|`|e7f08547633712e71101da94dfe8f311aa	The best answer would be to check the user manual of your computer. Go to the computer maker's website and look for the user manual for your particular computer. Look at the motherboard specifications and it will tell you what kind of processors are supported. It is probably a compatability problem.    Thanks,  Charlie

AA10404925	No, it means you didnt read the installation manual!|`|TRLRsNwWaa	Hi!    There are websites that will tell you whether you need to upgrade your power supply or not. Unfortunately, I've not found them very helpful, simply because there seems to be so many unknowns in every system, that so many assumptions need to be made, that you just don't get the accuracy you need.    I'm sorry, but it looks like it is going to be down to "fit it and see if you get any problems". I know you have fitted it already, but no signal sounds like the card might not have been pushed into it's slot properly, or the cable not connected properly.    In modern supplies, the fan runs as fast as it needs to, to keep things cool. So when not much power is being drawn, the fan barely moves.    I cannot be sure without looking at the computer myself of course, but in your position, I would try again. Follow the instructions with the replacement card carefully and making sure the card is seated fully home and it's connectors too.    When the computer was designed, there probably wasn't too much "headroom" included in the power supply, so with the fan running so loudly as well, it's not looking too good I'm afraid.    A good computer shop will be able to supply you with a compatible supply that has a higher rating. If possible, you should get a quiet supply as well. Once you've got used to a quite computer, a noisy fan is surprisingly annoying.    Good luck!|`|9912a3d54566a717480e58ffb98c2df9aa	your PC has an integrated video card on the motherboard, with share memory 256 MB. first step take off new card, reboot system, enter BIOS, look up for Video settings, choose PCI,VGA, PCI-E for primary - one of three represent your BIOS, switch off and unplug PC, install new card to the slot, reboot computer, after OS boot, install driver and software

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	A good answer would require more info from you.    Who is your Internet provider - and what level are they providing?  Access speeds are anywhere from 55,000 bps to 15,000,000 bps.  Easy way to think of that  "b" or "byte" is as a "letter".  Not 100% correct, but close enough.    Some Internet Service Providers (ISP) have a line coming to just your house.  Other ISP provide what used to be called a "party line" - with it - you share the line with your neighbors.  This means if your neighbor is downloading a movie and you try to download a song - it will take you longer because the line is busy serving 2 requests.      Then we would need to know what software you are using to access the Internet - Microsoft Explorer (which version) or other software.    Your computer - how much RAM in memory, size of cache, etc.|`|othezA6Caa	Depends on how old your system is and how much (RAM) it currently uses up. For a little help, clear out your cookies, remove all unneeded applications/programs/files through Windows control panel if you are using a PC. You may also want to ask your ISP about how many megabytes you are suppose to be getting and why your line is slow. They'll know more as they will perform line scans to determine why your Internet may be slow. If you are using a router, that may be the case in this situation. Try not using a router and use one a single active internet connection, again without the router.      Use all those tips and you should be just fine. If your RAM is not full, your system should be up and running within minutes with help from your ISP.|`|RxMXfMotaa	How fast is your internet connection?

A Lenovo is also good quality.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	During the past 9 years, I have purchased 2 notebooks and 2 desktops from www.ubid.com    Both notebooks were  HP.  Never had a problem with either one.  Newest one is about 12 months old.  One deskptop was IBM, one was Sony.    Some of the items on uBid are Refurbished - this means that either:  1 - the item was returned to a company authorized repair shop because something was wrong.  It was repaired, tested, and in some cases given a full warranty.    2 - maybe a salesman sample    When I bid on these, I set a max price of about 20% below the going retail rate.  To determine what is the true retail price, I place a very low bid (say $100 - $200) on an item.  I do not expect to get it for that price.  But uBid displays - in your account information - your bidding history and the final selling price of the item.  For something like 30-60 days.  So I bid on several and see what the true "selling price" is averaging.  I then reduce this by about 20% and then go after winning one.    Some days of the week or days of the month, there are fewer bidders.  The other week, I was bidding on a Sunday for a camera which went for 20% less than the recent average selling price for that model.    Another thing I like to do is go to www.cnet.com and check their reviews of the make/model that I am interested in.  Cnet will also provide you several prices from websites where you can buy that model without bidding (in most cases).  So I take the prices from CNET and go back to uBid to see if I can get a better deal.  Sometimes I can, sometimes I cannot.  But its worth a try if you are not in a hurry to buy something.

8505f8b8a6b352aa54ae55365642b570aa	There is no need for "special software" (like Parawin) anymore - it was needed in the past when Windows itself did not support Rusian typing.    Nowadays MS Windows supports Russian input just fine - both with Standard keyboard layout or Phonetic (when A-A,E-E,T-T,O-O,...).    One can not compare System keyboard tools of Windows with any 3rd party program/site/driver - System tools are always better, handier and problem-free.      You just need 10 minutes to setup your Windows (no effect to non-Russian functionality) for typing in Russian.    Please see the instruction (for different Windows versions) in the section  "How to type Russian on any keyboard" of the site devoted to Cyrillic under non-Russian MS Windows:    http://RusWin.net    ***
FBQZ06vraa	Try running Ad-Aware in Safe Mode.   Safe Mode often keeps malware from protecting itself.    Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Good luck.|`|R7VSsVCFaa	reinstall your windows

XkkY2Lw0aa	Looking at the processor and graphics, I don't think anything can make a major difference, due to the graphic card being integrated, meaning that it's permanently stuck to the motherboard. Also, if it only comes with 1 GB RAM, it's a fair chance that it can only hold 2 sticks, or if you're lucky, 4 sticks. Otherwise, the processor is not able to play any recent games.     If you want a gaming pc, either build a new one from scratch off of www.newegg.com or buy a decent one for $800 from a local retailer like Best Buy or Fry's Electronics, which should be able to get a pretty decent gaming desktop, and fulfills your requirements.

15923585f61e0874c29cdbeba611902baa	Blank or sparse articles on Wikipedia really disturb me, so a paid article situation sounds like a good idea to me. While a paid editor would carry some concerns about objectivity, I know that I would rather see an article with SOME content about a topic, even if it was paid for, than to just be presented with an empty page.  Better yet, if the paid author of the content were transparent and fully disclosed that they received funding to write the article, then I can evaluate it for what it's worth.  I could always check the article history to see what purportedly unpaid editors did to the article, after it was seeded by the original commercial author.  Worst case, I can always keep hunting on other sites for more information (which wouldn't likely be nearly as transparent as the disclosed article on Wikipedia)!|`|7fXL4knpaa	The primary purpose of Wikipedia and MyWikiBiz is different.     Wikipedia aims at providing information with a NPOV (though it fails to do so many times). To uphold NPOV and V they have the notability guidelines.     On the other hand, MyWikiBiz is a business. They allow company owners (who are disgruntled because their Wikipedia page was deleted) to say what they want and bury whatever they do not want people to read. More or less like a paid webspace.    I wonder what customers think when they come to know that the company they are dealing with paid money just to get a wiki page up. Not a very positive impression IMO.|`|GFndkPFLaa	A hard-earned long-lasting legacy is arguably better. Paying for someone just to write for you is just a waste of money. You can leave your article blank until the whole nation can recognize you.|`|Zqg6OUXWaa	Hi there, Kohs. For all that you can be quite acerbic some of the time, this is actually an interesting question, and I'll answer in all good faith.    You already know this, but I'll disclaim it for any other reader: I am a Wikipedia editor and administrator and so am probably biased here. Use your own discretion in forming an opinion based on this answer.    When we consider which situation is "better", the first thing to consider is the goal of the person considering the situations. I'll assume that we have three agents: one representative of a commercial organization (let's say they sell "sock puppets", just for fun ;) ); one independent reader looking for information about sock puppets and creators thereof; and one Wikipedia editor, who wants to make sure that articles are neutral, accurate, informative, verifiable, etc. I assume, for the purposes of this question, and given what context I have about your old MyWikiBiz operation, that these hypothetical articles would be located on Wikipedia rather than some other wiki or web page.    There are several variables that change the desirability of a given scenario for these agents. Here are the ones I consider, where each has the additional option of the non-existence of the theoretical article:    1. Is the article neutral, mostly-neutral (e.g. neutral tone but omitting criticism), or promotional?  2. Is the information about the company verifiable (using reliable, third-party sources), somewhat verifiable (e.g. using company website, press releases, or paid product reviews for a significant chunk of the referencing), or not verifiable (e.g. only company website and/or press releases used for referencing)?  3. Will the existence of a Wikipedia page on the company have a real-world, that is, offline, effect on their public recognition and/or sales?    From there, it's easy to generalize for each agent which states they would prefer. Here follows, in list form, their assumed preferences:    1. Neutrality   a) The company representative    ? A promotional article is desirableit advertises, and promotes positive public opinion    ? A mostly-neutral article is desirable, but may be less desirable than a promotional article    ? A neutral article is preferable to no article, but may be slightly undesirable, especially if the company has historically faced significant criticism    ? A non-existent article is definitely undesirable   b) The independent reader    ? A promotional article is undesirablefew enjoy reading spam    ? A mostly-neutral article is desirable, but may be less desirable than a neutral article, since the reader may be interested in related controversy    ? A neutral article is desirable: it lets them make their own opinion by providing objective facts    ? A non-existent article is undesirable, as more information is better   c) The Wikipedia editor    ? A promotional article is completely unacceptable given the policy of neutral point of view    ? A mostly-neutral article is undesirable, but tolerable, especially if the page is tagged with any notices that it is lacking information about relevant criticism    ? A neutral article is desirable: it advances Wikipedia's goals    ? A non-existent article is ignored; though it might be slightly undesirable, it is definitely preferable to a promotional article    2. Verifiability   a) The company representative    ? A verifiable article is desirableit allows readers to find more out about the company and its history, and is less likely to be deleted by Wikipedia    ? A mostly-verifiable article is desirable, especially as it will point users primarily to sources which are themselves promotional of the company    ? An unverifiable article is preferable to no article, and desirable insofar as it is desirable in other categories, but is definitely less preferable than anything but a non-existent article    ? A non-existent article is definitely undesirable   b) The independent reader    ? A verifiable article is highly desirable, since they can find much more information about sock puppets    ? A mostly-verifiable article is not very desirable, but better than anything but a verifiable articlemore verifiability is better    ? An unverifiable article is undesirable: readers can probably find all the information elsewhere, e.g. the company website    ? A non-existent article is undesirable, as more information is better   c) The Wikipedia editor    ? A verifiable article is highly desirable: it advances Wikipedia's goals    ? A mostly-verifiable article is undesirable, as it serves to use Wikipedia to amplify availability of the other sources and the perhaps non-neutral information therein, but might be tolerable    ? An unverifiable article is unacceptable, violating Wikipedia's verifiability policydeletion will likely be advocated    ? A non-existent article is ignored; though it might be slightly undesirable, it is definitely preferable to an unverifiable article    3. Offline effect   a) The company representative prefers offline effect: promotion of their brand is desirable   b) The independent reader won't care about offline effect: he or she chooses their own actions and will either be interested in the company and its products or not   c) Wikipedia editors will marginally prefer to have no offline effect, as Wikipedia generally shouldn't fundamentally alter what it describes. That being said, if verifiability and neutrality are established, this should not be a problem for the Wikipedia editor      In (1), though both Wikipedia editors and readers will generally prefer a more neutral article, all of the agents are at least willing to accept a mostly-neutral article. In (2), all agents desire verifiability, but it is less of a concern for the reader and ev|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Wikipedia is for information, not advertising, so it's a bad idea to copy promotional content to Wikipedia (and if companies are paying for it, it's promotional, not informational).
RbNniX0waa	Most defiantly. Although at first they may seem a major extra expense, just think how annoyed you'd be if your product broke hours after purchase. Now whilst you might say you'd just return it to the store I would argue a few points;    1)Most standard warranty's don't include accidental damage - whilst most extended ones do (on electronic products i mean)    and     2)If you weren't to take it out and something went wrong you would have to claim on your house insurance, and whilst that might seem the easier option, you have to take into account that they too will charge you and will take a great deal longer resolving your fault.

Save the download to your special folder, named (i.e. IE folder).  Run  it, and follow the guidelines in there.  Usually there are Questions :  1) Do you want to install all ? ( Recommended)  2) Repair ?    You have to choose one of them.  REboot your computer , and try to click on the e-icon of IE.  Hopefully you could find the solution, otherwise you have to take your PC to a service center.  There might be a hardware problem in there.
2LbTrlQnaa	Hit the abuse button at the bottom of your page and report it.  You must block the person so that he cannot communicate with you further|`|WB028eTDaa	Yeah. Probably. Or tell him to stop. That's actually illegal now.|`|gUy60Efhaa	can't you block him somehow?  or just put up a permaneant message about this idiot who is harassing you.|`|42WmRqNoaa	go under the help section on myspace. Find the link about cyber bullying.    Then you tell myspace whats happening and they will take action and erase the bullies account.|`|2afVnStxaa	Report the "bully" to the administrator and then block the "bully" if this person uses other accounts after this to bully you do the same for any account they use. If they are bullying you then myspace will delete or suspend that account and they won't bother you for long after this as if they use someone else's account, or they get a new one to do this, myspace will delete and/or suspend these as well. But in the future be careful who you add as a friend and mark your account that only friends can contact you and view certain things on your account. Just set the entire account to private and this way only your friends can access it to IM oe send you mail and such. Hope this helps. Good luck to you. Report also all of this to "Tom" he should be in your friends list. He is the one that created myspace in the first place and he takes things like this very seriously.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	go steal something from wal mart|`|GoWPQvgHaa	block him|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Report it, set your account to private and block this perverted.|`|nxBkPPu7aa	sure you should|`|jmq2i59Jaa	naw just tell tom the owner he'll look into it for ya|`|kLPaq30Eaa	You can contact MySpace and let them know the problem. You can also change your settings so that non-friends can't contact you via messages. Go to "My Account" and then choose "Spam". There's all kinds of different settings there that make it impossible for people you don't know to contact you.|`|Wt81sGW5aa	make a seperate account and secretly cyberbully him/her back|`|U5RUc5wZaa	Yes. Having a myspace is not worth the bullying. Plus, Myspace is the new booty call.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	No. You should report it to MySpace & possibly local police. You should also go into your account settings & privacy settings. Change your e~mail (make a new one quick & free w/ gmail or hotmail & give it to NO ONE!) You should set your account as private that only friends you approved can see. Block incoming comments/messages from people you don't know. Change your main pic to something else for awhile ~ anything ~ a pic of a cat or whatever, just nothing that shows you. After about a month, change your main pic back, the bully should tire by then & wouldn't know where to find you maybe.     Good luck. Think of that little girl Megan that is dead as a result of cyberbullying & that crazy venomous woman is still alive. This stuff is taken seriously now. REPORT IT & PROTECT YOURSELF!!|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	report to the admin.|`|6BS4Oj8vaa	ignore him and make it so he cant comment you without adding you and stuff like that. maybe it's just someone messing around with you to see what you wil do|`|AA11195073	no just dint write back or read the messages|`|eVyGiF7Xaa	It happens alot.

Then get a Facebook account.

IT MAKES THEM DO IT MORE  if your really nice  it defeats their whole purpose  be nice! ohhh and dont use any cuss words  say stuff like uhm you dont bother me  you must have a boring life if all you wanna do is harass me.|`|j4hmUPJgaa	Block him & set it to private. I personally would delete it. Myspace isn't safe. I had Mystalkers & my fiance even had a girl obsessed with him that never met him. We both deleted ours.|`|x1zESSeFaa	I would not delete it.  I would report this person to Myspace.  Get some of your friends to report him/her and hopefully that will give this person some warning.  Also, if you feel threatened or are scared that this person my harm you physically, contact the authorities as soon as possible.  Lets all keep the Internet a safe an fun place to meet people.  Dont let one idiot ruin it for the rest of us.  I am sure that you will soon again enjoy your Myspace experience.|`|zwvSmpNUaa	Honestly, first of all this is myspace, creepy... second of all its cyberbullying. I know there have been very bad instances of this but they obviously dont have the balls to confront you in person so what ever they have to say shouldnt phaze you it is really meaningless. you should know that there are most likely plenty of people who care about you. you could jsut cut off myspace cold turkey for like 2 weeks|`|RPLaXU42aa	If you are really worried and scared you should consider it.   I don't have a myspace page but can you have private and public accounts? If so, make it a private account.|`|9JAABheUaa	The same thing happened to me hun. Dont delete your account, just go onto their profile and in the contact box it should say BLOCK USER. Click it:]|`|moEtlwRLaa	ohh wow, cyberbullying, they're so scary.....lame, just fight back, i think of it as a game between me and them when that happens.|`|ZbXiw5gdaa	No... never let a bully push you around period..  if you do find out who he is block them ignore them. make it so you have to check your comments before they show up on your profile.|`|2Gmf13W7aa	Go to account settings and make it were just your friends can message you

You have cache on the CPU inside the computer, but I'm guessing you mean the Internet Explorer cache?    If you click on "Tools" and the delete browsing history, you will delete your Internet cache, so it can only be recovered with special software.    I hope this helps a bit?!

Be sure to have a descent spyware and virus program or you can scan online free in multiple sources. Make sure you know about safety because many peer to peer networks have viruses. The link below has many resources including free antiviruses.  http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html...            Top P2P programs in order of popularity    1) eDonkey / Overnethttp://compnetworking.about.com/gi/dynam...  eDonkey/Overnet is a state-of-the-art P2P file sharing software system. Especially popular in Europe, the two P2P networks eDonkey and Overnet combined support a large base of users and files. The eDonkey P2P client connects to both networks; the Overnet client is being merged into future releases of eDonkey. eDonkey runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers. The free version of eDonkey contains embedded advertising but none of the dreaded "spyware" found in some free file sharing software.     2) Shareazahttp://www.shareaza.com/  Shareaza is an up-and-coming P2P file sharing program. This client offers an extremely powerful search engine capable of connecting to multiple popular P2P networks including eDonkey, BitTorrent and Gnutella. Shareaza file sharing software includes intelligence for detecting fake and/or corrupted files. The free Shareaza download also contains no ads or spyware. As the installed base of Shareaza client users grows, expect Shareaza to become an even better P2P file sharing program.     3) WinMXhttp://www.topshareware.com/WinMX-downlo...  WinMX offers a large P2P file sharing network and a feature-rich client program that has evolved over years of development. True, WinMX has a reputation for being complex and more difficult to use than some alternatives. However, WinMX also provides power to users in managing their downloads, and it offers a wide selection of music (MP3) files. Some WinMX users report waiting in long queues to download popular files. WinMX software runs only on the Windows family of operating systems.     4) BitTorrenthttp://www.bittorrent.com/download  BitTorrent is another free P2P software application. It has attracted a loyal following among those interested in sharing movies and television programs. The offical BitTorrent P2P client generally does not support bandwidth throttling, meaning that it will tend to monopolize a network connection and not allow surfing the Internet or otherwise utilizing the network while files are being downloaded or uploaded. A freely-available alternative BitTorrent client overcomes this limitation.     5) Limewirehttp://www.limewire.com/english/content/...  The Limewire P2P file sharing program connects to the Gnutella P2P network. Limewire client software is widely recognized for its clean user interface that does not contain adware. Sometimes billed as the "fastest file sharing program," Limewire claims to offer relatively good search and download performance. Free Limewire software downloads are available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Limewire Pro pay clients also exist.     6) Morpheushttp://www.morpheus.com/download.asp  Morpheus P2P client application downloads exist in both free and paid Ultra versions. Compared to the free version, the Morpheus Ultra download additionally removes bundled advertising. Morpheus clients are capable of searching Gnutella2, FastTrack, eDonkey2K and Overnet P2P networks.     7) eMulehttp://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/g...  The eMule project started with the goal of building an improved free eDonkey client. eMule has achieved a large user base, connecting both to the eDonkey P2P file sharing network and a few others. It contains no advertising, and its software base is well-maintained by an open source development team. The chief limitation of eMule's P2P file sharing program is its speed: eMule typically performs downloading much slower than other P2P clients.     8) Areshttp://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/  Ares is a full-featured free P2P network with its own file sharing programs including Ares Galaxy. Ares clients support decentralized music and other file sharing and include a built-in chat service. Ares strives to offer the simplicity of Kazaa clients with no adware and fast connection times.     9) BearSharehttp://www.bearshare.com/  The BearShare P2P file sharing program is a popular free software client for the Gnutella P2P network. Both free and pay downloads of BearShare file sharing programs exist.     10) Kazaahttp://www.kazaa.com/us/products/downloa...  The Kazaa software family (including the Kazaa Lite family of applications) has been the single-most popular P2P file sharing program / system of all time. Kazaa is fast and e

Disable System Restore (Windows Me/XP).   Update the virus definitions.   Run a full system scan and delete all the files detected.   Delete any values added to the registry.   Edit the Win.ini file.   Edit the System.ini file.    For specific details on each of these steps, read the following instructions.    1. To disable System Restore (Windows Me/XP)  If you are running Windows Me or Windows XP, we recommend that you temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows Me/XP uses this feature, which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan infects a computer, System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.    Windows prevents outside programs, including antivirus programs, from modifying System Restore. Therefore, antivirus programs or tools cannot remove threats in the System Restore folder. As a result, System Restore has the potential of restoring an infected file on your computer, even after you have cleaned the infected files from all the other locations.    Also, a virus scan may detect a threat in the System Restore folder even though you have removed the threat.    For instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:   How to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore   How to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore    Note: When you are completely finished with the removal procedure and are satisfied that the threat has been removed, reenable System Restore by following the instructions in the aforementioned documents.    For additional information, and an alternative to disabling Windows Me System Restore, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article: Antivirus Tools Cannot Clean Infected Files in the _Restore Folder (Article ID: Q263455).    2. To update the virus definitions  Symantec Security Response fully tests all the virus definitions for quality assurance before they are posted to our servers. There are two ways to obtain the most recent virus definitions:   Running LiveUpdate, which is the easiest way to obtain virus definitions: These virus definitions are posted to the LiveUpdate servers once each week (usually on Wednesdays), unless there is a major virus outbreak. To determine whether definitions for this threat are available by LiveUpdate, refer to Virus Definitions (LiveUpdate).   Downloading the definitions using the Intelligent Updater: The Intelligent Updater virus definitions are posted daily. You should download the definitions from the Symantec Security Response Web site and manually install them. To determine whether definitions for this threat are available by the Intelligent Updater, refer to Virus Definitions (Intelligent Updater).    The latest Intelligent Updater virus definitions can be obtained here: Intelligent Updater virus definitions. For detailed instructions read the document: How to update virus definition files using the Intelligent Updater.      3. To scan for and delete the infected files   Start your Symantec antivirus program and make sure that it is configured to scan all the files.   For Norton AntiVirus consumer products: Read the document: How to configure Norton AntiVirus to scan all files.   For Symantec AntiVirus Enterprise products: Read the document: How to verify that a Symantec Corporate antivirus product is set to scan all files.  Run a full system scan.   If any files are detected, take note of the file names and click Delete.    Important: If you are unable to start your Symantec antivirus product or the product reports that it cannot delete a detected file, you may need to stop the risk from running in order to remove it. To do this, run the scan in Safe mode. For instructions, read the document, How to start the computer in Safe Mode. Once you have restarted in Safe mode, run the scan again.    After the files are deleted, restart the computer in Normal mode and proceed with the next section.     Warning messages may be displayed when the computer is restarted, since the threat may not be fully removed at this point. You can ignore these messages and click OK. These messages will not appear when the computer is restarted after the removal instructions have been fully completed. The messages displayed may be similar to the following:    Title: [FILE PATH]  Message body: Windows cannot find [FILE NAME]. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.      4. To delete the value from the registry  Important: Symantec strongly recommends that you back up the registry before making any changes to it. Incorrect changes to the registry can result in permanent data loss or corrupted files. Modify the specified subkeys only. For instructions refer to the document: How to make a backup of the Windows registry.    Click Start > Run.   Type regedit   Click OK.     Note: If the registry editor fails to open the threat may have modified the registry to prevent access to the registry editor. Security Response has developed a tool to resolve this problem. Download and run this tool, and then continue with the removal.      Navigate to the subkey:    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\...  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\...  RunServices  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\W...  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentContr...      In the right pane, delete any value that was detected during the scan.    |`|bc75c3fa1e17c4863024efbbbfc7f1eaaa	Use one of the Clean up tools to clear out your temp files where the virus is located.  http://securitynewsfromthenet.blogspot.c...

I'd suggest that if you're interested in working on games, you might want to start with something simpler than C++, since it's pretty hard to learn for a beginner.    It's easier to learn Visual Basic or Java than C++. You also should take a look at games that are scriptable. Designing "mods" for these games can be a lot of fun, and again is easier than starting out with C++

vmrqwMjBaa	Its doubtful your adapter has one built in.     You dont have to have one....but if you cant replace your laptop if something happens to it you might want to invest in one just to be safe.|`|gSKgj9V6aa	All modern A/C adapter on laptops have built in power regulators.    Laptops are designed for travelling worldwide so it can handle worldwide voltages.  Normally, it should be able to handle anywhere from as low as 90VAC to 250VAC.  Some adapters have built in thermal sensors which monitor the temperature and shuts down the adapter to prevent it from overheating.    So the answer is yes. There is a limited surge protection capability on your A/C adapter.  However, Surge protection only works if the power outlet is properly grounded.  If not, you will run the risk of damaging the A/C adapter since surge protection does not work without proper grounding.    I'm on my 9th laptop in my 11 years of working. The only problem I had with the A/C adapter is a cracked plastic housing which cracked when the adapter got too hot.  Even with a innards showing, the A/C adapter still worked flawlessly until I returned it to the manufacturer who promptly replaced it without question.  I had co-worker who fried his A/C adapter because the power outlet he used didnt have a ground wire.|`|AA10532660	nope sorry|`|WEJ3CzXBaa	No, it's not that big of a deal.

(An  AUTOCAD will not open a UNIGRAPHICS 3D-files because UNIGRAPHICS is a high-end 3D creation software!)

Model can be viewed from different directions 'including isometric views' by clicking on concerned icons!     Models can be viewed as continuously rotating (choose a fast or slow object moving as you please!) There are concerned icons to realize it!    You can link 3D models to 'drawing-mode', which either shows drawings that have been already created or prepare  to create new drawings!    To grasp a 3D model, a concerned 3D model creation process plays an important role!

Apparently Excel needs dedicated font resources for each chart (even if the charts use the same fonts), and if font autoscaling is enabled, the resource requirements are doubled. Font autoscaling can be disabled for each chart to alleviate this resource crisis.

If u r a Novice user then Windows Movie maker is the best,  it is easy to work with and has got many transitions. I think u should output it from Movie Maker without audio and then import it to Nero 7, it has got movie editor, and add audio, audio clarity is best here u can even generate multichannel audio and mixing in Nero, then output it using the best encoder( I use mp4 export from Nero). Now it is your choice if u want to go for good quality write it to DVD(use DVD Labs Pro) or use Nero itself to burn it onto a CD( of not as VCD but use SVCD it give higher quality)  If you are good in doing all these then I invite u to the www.doom9.net community, u can find great tutorials and guidance to end up with high quality movies and great encoders like DivX, Xvid etc.  You'll get all the necessary softwares in this Site, www.doom9.net  Thank You.|`|F9Dw68KNaa	have XP? then this is my favorite http://www.download.com/Windows-Movie-Ma...|`|9c93bfd6fdcaa2231fe832dc19a35a66aa	http://bestofrest.blogspot.com/search/la...

Download the following five programs:    1) CCleaner  does an excellent job cleaning up temporary internet files, cookies, temp files, recycle bin, and prefetch folder.    2) If you don't have an antivirus program, EITHER AVG  and Avast  -- only install ONE.    3) Hitman Pro  will let you automatically install, update, and run in Safe Mode many of the best free and free-to-try antispyware programs all with one click, including Spybot Search & Destroy, Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE, SpywareBlaster, Ewido, and free trials of Webroot Spysweeper and PCTools SpywareDoctor.  The free version of Spybot Search & Destroy allows autoupdates, but Hitman Pro helps in keeping the others up to date with one click.    4) Winsockfix " rel="nofollow">http://www.majorgeeks.com/download4372.h... which is used to fix your internet connectivity if cleaning up malware breaks your internet connection.    5) Hijackthis  which catalogs the places programs (both legitimate and malicious) are usually found, so that an expert can tell you if there's anything nasty remaining.    First, run CCleaner to clean out temporary files.  In the Advanced section only check off "Old Prefetch data".  Then click on Issues and scan for issues. Have it fix them all and make backups in case something gets erased that shouldn't (although I've never had problems with CCleaner's issue fixes). Then Scan for issues again until you get "No issues found". Then click on Tools and uninstall programs you don't want, and while in Tools click on Startup to remove things you don't want starting automatically. If you're unsure what you need to keep you can google for advice or email me with your questions.    Then update your antivirus program and then reboot into Safe Mode to run a full scan, then reboot after cleaning up what it found.    Then run Hitman Pro with the Safe Mode box checked.  Reboot after cleaning up what it found.    Now run Hijackthis with the "Scan and Save Logfile" button, and email me the hijackthis.log, and I can advise you if there's any malware still there.    If your internet connection isn't working after removing malware, run Winsockfix.

1cdsJ3lpaa	What about ink catridges? A laser printer would be way too bulky and it would produce way too much heat. There's no way you'd be able to keep the heat down in your computer. Also as far as putting in paper your going to allows to less airflow because now there's less space inside your computer thus leading to more heat. A printer inside a laptop is completely impractical.|`|bxlYleZkaa	We have enough trouble with printers as they are without messing up laptops with them!|`|hXHBm1BSaa	That is NOT all it would need. Haven't you ever looked at a printer? You would need all the gears, ink cartridges, paper feed rollers, and the controller board, most of which are about one third to half the size of a laptop motherboard. this would multiply the size of the laptop by about 4 times, probably more. You would also need to add another accessory, a wheelbarrow to carry it!|`|AnfbukGBaa	it could work as long as u find some machine compact enough to put inside. the ink catridges would be the main problem cause if u get them small enough to fit inside your laptop they wouldn't hold enough ink to print much u would have to constantly change it|`|Az6s1jEHaa	sounds stupid. I would say just make it so your laptop could just plug into any printer without having to download that printers program into the laptop...make more universal multifunctional printers.|`|AaoclPYCaa	The size would be a problem but its a good idea.  It would have to be big enough to hold printer cartridges and paper.  Would make the idea of a lap top kinda difficult.
bAfKumd1aa	I would have to agree.  While the overheating is the issue, the charging would not be effected by this.  If your friend has the same brand and type of charger and it works fine, it has to be your cord.  Sometimes they can get breaks inside the rubber that you can't even see but check it over very good from end to end.  You can also try putting a very small amount of vaseline on the terminal of the cable, Vaseline acts as a conducter and if there is a connection problem, this could let you know.  This is not a long term fix, just a testing method.|`|b0z0pbdXaa	this is obviously a short in the power cord.|`|jmq2i59Jaa	sounds like you move your laptop around alot so what happened is the wires where it plugs into computer on the power cord are lose in which case a new power cord may be in order now for the over heat problem your computer needs to breath so setting it on the bed it is being smothered!! you need to have it on a hard flat surface with the back slightly elevated and yes a good cleaning probably wouldn't hurt use canned air or let a pro clean it|`|AA11605110	if your friends charger works fine then there is probably a broken wire in your charger. is the end bent where it plugs into the back of your computer?|`|uGtbqLhWaa	It's the part where you plug it in to your laptop, it's messed up from movement with the charger in, it can be replaced.

9xrEjORUaa	Man it is quite easy....you just download AVG antivirus from http://download.com/   .Also download spybot search&destroy.....................when you are using an antivirus you should update regularly.....BEST OF LUCK|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure to ALWAYS keep your virus scanner's database up to date.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|hXHBm1BSaa	First McAfee is not good at removing fake virus infections, it often leaves files behind. If you have MS Defender it is a security program from Microsoft. And no amount of security will protect you from careless browsing. Uninstal ALL toolbars, internet assistants, internet optimisers, and similar, apart from Yahoo,MSN and Google toolbars. Any others are open doors to junk. Download malwarebytes, let it update and then run a scan. It will probably ask for a restart to complete the repair.Seriously consider getting a decent anti-spyware/virus program and uninstalling McAfee. Avoid all download sites which have any content posted by visitors. Avoid any site which asks for you to install anything, especially Activex, unless it is a reputable site like Microsoft. Do NOT attempt to click ANY buttons on any popup windows, even the close x is normally programmed to send an accept. Do not disable the annoying security popups from windows when you try to open a program or download. Do so and the machine can be continuously downloading and installing junk without you knowing. Ignore any of these and you are basically telling any security software that it must accept anything that comes along, defeating the object.|`|zF12F5Hfaa	Use this website for the Win32 thing. http://www.liutilities.com/products/wint...    Then dont do anything for windows defender because it is a program that helps deffend windows from viruses.    I would sugest getting Zone alarm  A different Firewall than what u have.    U might already have to firewalls that are conflicting each other witch is letting bad things in.

If you have date you want to save don't forget to back it up first taking care not to back up any folders you suspect may have a virus.|`|9c7nKTIkaa	Get rid of Mcafee and don't even think about installing Norton Antivirus to your computer as it will slow it down.    You can try these for free:  1) AVG  2) Avast  3) Avira    If you are willing to spend some money then try Kaspersky.    If you need more protection get windows defender.    Also, try not to have more than one antivirus program on your computer.|`|fbiGxl2vaa	try this program its usually quite good with these kind of problems     (http://www.malwarebytes.org/)|`|1RhzszWRaa	Get something better and cheaper than Mcafee. Such as : http://avast.com .    Don't download stuff (movies, programs, pics, etc.) from unknown sites, and scan ALL incoming downloads.  Cutback on inappropriate or warez sites, those are great ways to get viruses.

Now viruses are much thriftier and dangerous.  They use random names and spread throughout your computer.  The worst part is if you dont delete all the files at once, the next time you reboot the virus will completely regenerate itself.  You need the latest in antivirus software to get rid of them.  I recommend the program at:    http://www.spyware-fix.net      The program has over 250,000 threats in its database which ensures it will remove every bit of the virus.  Good luck!

FastStone is fast and easy to use, it is capable of doing several photo managing tasks as well as minor to moderate editing.

Wrf5orAuaa	You have to stop looking at porn sites in your sleep. The only way for porn sites to pop up on your computer is for the computer to have accessed these sites. If not you, then someone else.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	stop going to porno sites..|`|76fYDbsCaa	Get pop-up blocker, firewall, or it might be a virus.

NgtGJWdDaa	Generally there are 3 schools of thought on this.  On one hand you have the people who love XP and hate Vista.  Others hate XP and love Vista.  The rest really don't care.    Personally I prefer XP.  Purely because Vista is a resource hog and it is much less stable than XP.    The biggest differences are things like the GUI.  Some other background things and support for newer technology.  There are also security improvements in Vista.  Other differences:  Vista has Bitblocker  Vista has parental control  Updated DirectX.    To me, Vista just feels like a service pack of XP with some little applications.    Basically my thought is that if you don't need what Vista offers then stick with XP.  You can very easily make it look like Vista.  If you are however learning these things then you need to learn about Vista, most new systems are released with Vista as standard.    If we're honest then we simply have to admit that neither XP or Vista are all too great.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Vista is mostly the same unless you look at the GUI and the annoying UAC but other than that its XP with security flaws and messy code.

33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	They detect any errors in the RAM.    In a parity system, every byte (8 bits) gets an extra bit that adds up the content of the byte. If it's odd, parity bit is on. Even, parity bit is zero. Thus, by reading the byte, and compare the result with the parity bit, you can ensure the memory byte is working correctly.     ECC, on the other hand, is much more sophisticated, and actually CORRECTS errors through a series of algorithms and extra bits. I'm not going to get into actual principles, just say that it works, but it slows the memory system down for this reliability.     Normally these two systems are only seen on servers, where reliability and accuracy are paramount. They require special memory. Normal desktop / notebook memory does NOT have either of these features. And they require special chipset-level support (so you need a mainboard that does this, PLUS special memory that does this, to enable these).     ECC is a superior system to Parity, and parity is better than nothing at all.     Remember, all these checking happens in real-time, so these memory will perform a bit slower than your typical desktop memory.
m0fU0H7jaa	So obviously you know where and how to change the background of your channel page. Also, I would like to say that having a moving background in your channel is completely up to you and your preferences, but it is often a nuisance and steers people away. If you are going for a professional look, I would not suggest this.    However, if you do want your background to move, you must upload some sort of animated file, such as an animated .gif. If you were to try and take somebody else's picture from their channel background and upload it to yours, then you would simply be stealing a .jpg [or other picture file], not the original .gif.    For information on animated .gif's, check here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_In...    There are lots of simple, small applications that allow you to make animated .gifs or other animated picture files. A little bit of google research would lead you in the right direction very quickly.

B7THwJxvaa	"If I install a DVD-RW drive, will I be able to burn both DVD's and CD's ?"  Of course you can!    In checking all the popular sites, it appears you can't even get CD-RW drives anymore...So I'm assuming DVD-RW drives can burn CD's ?  You can still purchase CD-RWs in office/ computer stores or online.  Again, a DVD-drive CAN burn CD-R, CD-RW, and blank DVDs.|`|BVL85SAqaa	yes DVD-RW means you can burn dvds.    i once thought of building my own pc.
KSUksBZkaa	defrag it [just search google for instructions depending on your operating system]    reformat - though, this will restore ALL settings back to the way it was when you first got the computer and it will take off EVERYTHING pictures, music, software, any installed programs.    run virus and malware scans.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	All PCs tend to slow down over use. Being regular with maintenance helps to postpone the ageing.  To boost an old PC, do these  Scan for spyware and viruses.    Reduce the number of items on your startup list.    Uninstall all unwanted programs and remove junk from the drive.  Use CCleaner or DiskCleanup to clear out the temporary files, internet cache, recycle bin etc.  If you HDD is overloaded and cluttered with fragments, everything including startup will slow down. Fragmentation especially when its been ignored for a long time, causes performance deterioration by increasing file access time and drive activity. There are good automatic defragmenters like Diskeeper which you can set to run in the background as you go about using the PC. Its also said to defrag even if you have less than 15% free space.  http://diskeeper.com/|`|W4si7Z4Waa	Realistically, no.  If you surf the internet and download/install things NOT from a trustworthy source (aka made by a well-known name), it will never run as fast as you did when you first bought it because of all the stuff that gets put onto your comp.  That is, unless you bought a new hard drive and reinstalled the OS from scratch.  Otherwise, you're SOL and JWF because then even if you were to just simply reinstall the OS on the current hard drive, there will still be stuff on there, unless you do a clean sweep from a special software like KillDisk.  however, that doesn't mean that you can't speed up and maintain your computer speeds and get them close to it.  Just make sure that you have good anti-virus/spyware/etc. that you update constantly, and make sure you perform computer maintainance monthly, aka disk defrag, disk cleanup, registry defrag, registry cleanup etc.  That way, you maintain optimum speeds.|`|g5mXyBt4aa	There are several ways.    Step ONE    Navigate to:    My Computer > Local Disk (C:)    Right-click on the disk drive icon and go to "Properties". Next to the pie graph which indicates how much free space you have currently, and how much you have used already there should be a button called "Disk Cleanup". Click on it. The Disk Cleanup utility will load. Be patient and wait for it to calculate how much space it can free up. Once it has finished, a new window will pop-up titled:    "Disk Cleanup for (C:)"    Put a tick in all the boxes and click Ok.    Let it cleanup the files for you.    STEP TWO    Download a program called CCleaner. You can do that by going here:    http://www.download.com/CCleaner/3000-21...    After you've successfully installed the program, open it and click the button that says "Run Cleaner". Let it remove the junk files.     STEP THREE    Next download a program called AusLogics Disk Defragmenter. You can do that by going here:    http://www.download.com/Auslogics-Disk-D...    After you've successfully installed the program, run it. Under where it says "Select the disk that you want to defragment" choose: C:\ (Local, NTFS etc..). Click "Next". Let it defragment your harddrive. Be patient as it does so.    STEP FOUR    Next, download a program called Glary Utilities 2.10.0.622:    http://www.download.com/Glary-Utilities/...    After you've installed that successfully, go to the "Modules" tab and click on "Disk Cleaner" and follow the steps. After doing that, return to the "Modules" tab and click where it says "Registry Cleaner". Follow the steps when prompted. You can also go to the "1-Click Maintenance" tab if you would prefer it.        I know it sounds like a lot of programs to download, and a lot of instructions to follow - but trust me. After doing all that you will have cleaned up a lot of junk on your computer and by doing so, will have increased the speed dramatically. You will see a noticable change in speed and system performance.     All the programs are 100% safe. CNET makes sure of it.    Good Luck!

Blocking of context menus.    Put this into the body element, and it stops the context menu (at least in IE.  Haven't got firefox handy to try.)    
BKOgIfwHaa	The best place to start your research and learning on your own would be at Dlink or Netgear and know if you want wired networking or wireless networking I put the website link here for Dlink as my husband does this alot and relys on this site for alot of his questions.|`|FCFdYuchaa	http://computer-network-problems.blogspo...|`|600723dfdcffd21a543675ffff6aba69aa	I personally learn the best by watching videos instead of reading walls of text.

QoNEfo5Haa	Some viruses have been known to do this (do a scan for those). Check your BIOS or other settings as well (check the "wake on" setting especially). This should work. If not, simply clear your hard drive and restore the factory settings.|`|rfB8G7skaa	I'd just like to say that that is one nice computer you have there.    As for your problem...how bout just unplug it? lol|`|QUQY3HQYaa	well the first thing is DAAAAAAAAAANG that rig is smokin. lolz and the second thing is that the problem is probably with you power button look how you installed it in the case ive seen a few computers wehre thats an issue

UAYzLyN4aa	First, you do not have a connection speed to the internet of 100 MB/sec!      You probably have an Ethernet connection to your DSL modem or cable modem at 100 Mbit/sec (not Mbyte/sec), but the actual connection from there to the internet is much slower. Probably 1 or 2 Mbit/sec at most for a typical "high speed" connection in the US. Mine is 20 Mbit/sec, but I pay a lot for that.     Second, your bittorrent client is probably reporting in kB, that is to say, kiloBytes/second. (Convention in these things is that capital B means Bytes, lower case b means bits.) Although bytes stored in your computer are 8 bits each it really takes about 10 bits for a byte sent or received on the Internet, due to various overhead. So if you are getting 150 kBytes/sec download that is about 1.5 Mbit/sec download. That is most of a typical high speed connection to the net.     Third, your torrent download speeds are going to be limited by how fast others are willing to upload.     Count your blessings; I'm waiting on a torrent with just two seeds, both of which seem to be limited to 500 bytes/sec or so upload. I just hope I get it all before they both decide to go away.|`|pLbTRwNBaa	1) You're ISP might trottle torrent connections.    2) Your connection might be saturated.    3) Stop being a pirate.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	lol learn computer speak. 100 MEGA BITS not bytes thats where your ISP tricks you. getting 150kbs is average|`|XkkY2Lw0aa	No matter how great \your computer is, uTorrent won't be much faster than in other computers. uTorrent is just naturally slow, and it can't be helped. I guess that's the bad part about illegal downloading.

fj9rFzZAaa	Cd drive, hard drive, and fans are the onlything that spins.  ?BIOS? what was he talking about.  it's a chip.  oh and it's ok to say it, "Dell is bull ****".|`|jmq2i59Jaa	look for a DELL shop where you live or close by sounds like the fan is getting ready to go|`|7U0sPJ2saa	I had a desktop that started to make a weird grinding sort of sound. But it had completely blacked out by the time it started doing that. Apparently the arm that reads the hard drive had busted and every time it swung out to read the hard drive, it would just scratch the holy hell out of it.|`|XVOyBtbJaa	What model number is it?  I would suspect a fan blade possibly rubbing a wire internally, or touching something else it shouldn't in there.  Sometimes on the bottom, there is one single screw you can remove to allow you to pull your cd or dvd rom drive out. That could help isolate the problem if it stops after removing it.|`|28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	Something is interfering with your fan.  Save or back up all of your data (always a good idea to do this when you are going to tinker with your computer).  Take a can of compressed air and blow out the vents by the fan.  Do it gently and in one direction (presumably out or toward the side of the computer).  You can also try using something like a clean, unused paint brush to brush out the fan vents.  Troubleshoot the fan by turning the computer on, lift it up and tilt and see if it grinds.  The issue is that your fan has probably become off kilter for whatever reason (dust, loose connection, etc.).  You could take a crack at it yourself or take it to a computer repair place and ask them to take a look.  It may ultimately need to be replaced, so, be prepared for that.  Good luck.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	It can either be the hard drive or the cooling fan. I'd put my money on the cooling fan which isn't expensive to replace, and should be done as you need your lappy to keep it's cool..|`|Fe5i7UCxaa	You should call ur local computer repair shops and ask if they do free consultations. I went to a shop where they looked at my laptop for free to see what the problem was and they gave me an estimate of the costs. From the sound of it looks like either the fan  or hard drive has some how become loose causing that grinding noise. i've no idea what the hell Dell was saying about the BIOS update i mean i know what it is but a little software update isn't gonna help an internal physical problem. Sorry about ur frustration i've been there. Anyways i hope you find a shop that can help u :)

effa79c5567a10463ae7886adc920f55aa	You need to log in as Root to do so. If you have not set up the root account you must boot from the CD/DVD. When you get to the second screen for an install, go to the Menu bar and look for tools or utilities. There will be an option in there to "Change Password" or "Reset Password". Select that and for the user enter "root" and then a password. Once complete, reboot the Mac and log into the root account.

YMCUFX8daa	Looks like you're missing a closing curly brace - } - (blame my instructor for the name) at the end of your 3rd line from the bottom. That should've been caught by your compiler, but my guess is that now you've got an extra one below that code somewhere.    The other big problem is that you may need to drop the semicolons from your "if" statement lines. It has been a little while since I've played with Java, but I'm pretty sure they're disconnecting the lines below from the decision, which would cause your output.|`|IyCnihLmaa	You need to remove the semi colons at the end of both if lines:    if (totalCost     if (totalCost > 500.00)     When there is a semi colon, then it ends the if line and whatever is in yourprintln will be printed out because it is no longer tied to the if statement

The slimline series is actually intended more for casual use instead of gaming as it is in a very compact case with very little room for the needed hardware. I would suggest either buying a retail midsize gaming computer (xp's or alienware is good) or a much cheaper option is to buy the parts and build it yourself like I did. I ahve a computer that if I were to sell it retail value it would be about 2,500 USD. I payed 1,100 USD for the parts.

E5mFWOqqaa	Yes, it is safe. Frostwire is based off the same engine as Limewire, and uses the same Gnutella network. You'll be used to the interface, at least.    Frostwire comes with no adware/spyware/viruses when you download the program. Whe you begin downloading your files within the program, just don't download a file that looks suspicious- avoid any .exe programs, and files that are obvious fakes- music files with a small size, odd bitrate, or really weird length, etc.    As for movies and music, I would think that it downloads them just fine. You would have to use it to see though- you could very well download a movie that wasn't exactly what you were looking for.|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	Wow all I can say is that this service is awesome...

If you are not able to distinguish sinister downloads from safe ones then FrostWire is not for you.    ONLY download FrostWire from here:    http://www.download.com/FrostWire/3000-2...    It does both music and movies as well as pictures and programs.     FrostWire will work hard to improve your connectivity issues. It's like LimeWire Pro, but free.    I would recommend that you have an active Anti-Virus program running though, and that you use the right-click scan option on any files you choose to download.     Two fantastic programs to help keep you safe are:    - MalwareBytes Anti-Malware  - AVG Antivirus Free    You can download them both safely here:    http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...    http://www.download.com/AVG-Anti-Virus/3...

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space.

xe1NoWUNaa	Blue screen of death. Sounds like time to reinstall the OS.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|Z8oZGwE3aa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software.

The only time it would ever "fill up" would be if computers (server hardware specifically, although any comp can be used as a server) were never produced again, and then still, it would take hundreds if not thousands of years for the remaining servers to become too full...and I doubt all of them would.|`|OvKssKkraa	For our uses, it's infinite.

KnDkfBwkaa	Unless you are having a problem networking, I don't see why an MS rep would say that you have to have svchost. Svchost is a Windows only app that tracks program groups that run in the background. This can be a useful tool to narrow down problems that you may be having with a particular service in your PC computer.    There are programs that run in the background on a Mac also, but I don't know if there is an equivalent svchost for the Mac OS. You may want to post the question "Is there an equivalent svchost in the Mac OS?"    Hopefully you will get an answer that will shed some light on the subject.|`|38LXFX1saa	Mac has its own thing for networking.

With A-VSMART?, short for "Anti - Virus, Spyware, Malware, Adware, Rootkits and Trojans", prevention becomes the first line of defense by preventing viruses computer access and only allowing known, trusted applications to be installed. With prevention as the first line of defense, threats are mitigated because unknown applications, including malware, are denied execution rights by the firewall. If a virus cannot install or run, then it cannot do any damage. This new architecture is a fundamental change in how PCs can remain virus free versus the traditional, "detection based" security solutions that allow all applications access to the computer and then try to "detect" damaging files by recognizing the file's "signature" ...

To get further information take a look at: http://www.threehosts.com/build    You need a web hosting service which supports online payments like, Master Card, Visa & PayPal. It is very important that your service be uptime. It means that you can access your account whenever you want to update your web pages, and your visitors can view your website whenever they type your website address. If your hosting service is not uptime it is real hell!    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    If you want to run a successful e-commerce you must choose a reliable web hosting service. The security of your business directly depends on the security of your hosting service.

If its the latter, you should probably keep things much more simple and straight forward and clearly organized. If you are making your product, you might want to get a little more creative to better differentiate yourself (although as in all things moderation).

Or something is just not configured right, there are ways of starting the computer in safe-mode, refer to google on that, depending on what Operating system you are using. If that doesn't work, you could always send it to me as I own a computer repair company, I will diagnose the problem and see what's best next. Have to make sure that's not against terms and agreements with yahoo answers first though.|`|e6795a5889aedcd8f2ba7d31a4432df8aa	I sort of have that kind of similar problem when i restart my laptop, all i can see is my wallpaper and no start button no icons no nothing.    I tried turning the comp off and on but its still the same.    So i just randomly figured out a way to fix it by hibernating the laptop, my IBM i use shortcut key Fn+F12, for yours it should be some other keys to hibernate it.     Once hibernated, wake it up again, n you'll see the windows logo thing with a picture saying your user name and how many programs are running and all, don't click that, instead, click the turn off computer button on the bottom left. After that when you restart you laptop again, it'll be normal back.    Hope it helps. Not sure whether this is a right way to fix it but it works for me.|`|9c93bfd6fdcaa2231fe832dc19a35a66aa	boot from windows installation cd and run a repair install  http://mypchelp.blogspot.com/2006/10/win...|`|alMQ5v9Qaa	Always difficult to try and fix a computer without the machine in front of you.

F9Dw68KNaa	I don't know for sure if this will work but it always fixes like problems with mine.

Once you're signed in, on the left hand column, select wireless settings.  Under wireless channels, change the channel to "6"  Hit apply and wait.  After that is done, go back and change the channel back to "11", once again, hit Apply and wait.  You may have to restart your modem, router and pc after doing this.  Like I said, I'm not positive if it will work, but it's solved this same problem for me along with other problems like my wireless netword not being able to find my pc's IP address.|`|oHsdypCraa	I have that hardware and run it on Vista.

Wmhpzt9Haa	If you are looking for a pc error fix, the first place to check should be your computers registry files. For a simplistic definition, these files contain the instructions on how to operate the software and hardware on your computer. These Windows registry keys and files can begin to accumulate overtime and become corrupted and full of errors as software and hardware is added and removed from your computer. If these files get messed up in any way, then you will definitely encounter computer errors.  Alomst all computer errors can be fixed by repairing the registry files.You can check out  http://www.fix-computer-errors.info  There is a step-by-step guide and error repair software to fix computer errors on that site.

Distribution - is the system intended to be used by a controlled or defined group of people (such as an organization or group of organizations)? If yes - winforms. Or, is it intended to be used by an uncontrolled group of users (anyone who might be interested in the product, without having a prior direct relationship to you)? If yes - web-based.    2. Support - will the system have frequent updates and/or changes? Is it inconvenient or impractical to deploy these changes to every user ? If so, web-based is the answer. If not, winforms.    3. Interface - does the interface require sophisticated custom UI controls? If so, it is often easier to develop using winforms. If you only need typical form controls, web-based is often easier.    Evaluate each of these three aspects and make your decision based on that.

Spying isn't going to help your relationship either.  Either you have trust or you don't.  Suspicion makes things worse.      If you "sneak" and spy on her what exactly is the difference in Her "sneaking" and talking on the computer.  If you must spy, check the history on the computer after she finishes.  Sounds like your marriage is already in trouble.  I wish only the best to you and her.      If I found out you were spying on me, that would be the end anyway.  If you don't have honest communication, what do you have?      Even if I knew, I don't think I could tell someone else how to get the tools to commit a crime.

The program is a little more complex, but once you get the hang of it, you can download entire discographies, rather than one song at a time.  Look into Azureus.  That is your program you use.  Do a google or yahoo search for it.  Once that is installed, you have to go to host websites, such as Torrentspy.com, thepiratebay.org, or projectw.com.  From these sites, you download the torrent.

That being said, a CS degree is not a necessity but it would make you more marketable then a certificate.    The amount of time that you put into a certificate program could get you half way or more toward an Associates degree, which will look better on your resume.  Many small tech schools and colleges often offer AS programs that include industry certificates within the curriculum, like Microsoft, CompTIA, or Cisco.

You are reversing a subset of items inside a string.    So you would have to create an array of strings. Parse the contents of your original string by some separator, such as a space.

I might point out if you want to make it more efficient, on the line of the j loop, instead of iterating to i-1, you could iterate to i/2 as it is impossible for any number to be divisible by a number more than half of it.  However saying that since you are only looking for 1- 100 , this is fast enough... you should get the results in around 1 second.    int objStartVal = 1;  int objEndVal = 100;  int i, j;  for ( i=objStartVal; i  {  Boolean isPrime = true;  for (j=1;j  {  if (j!=1)  {  if ((i % j) == 0)  {  isPrime = false;  }  }  }  if (isPrime)  {  MessageBox.Show(i + " is a prime number.");  }  }|`|pP8Q4DWvaa	i dunno in c , but here it is in c++, convert it or something :p     include    include   using namespace std;    int main()  {      int number, variable, display_num;            for (number = 3; number           for (variable = 2; (number%variable > 0) && variable               for (display_num = 0; ((number - variable) == 1) && (display_num == 0); display_num++)                  cout       cout             system("pause");      return 0;  }      sorry i don't know c , i did this as an assignment a long time ago for c++, should be similar to what you are trying to get too. obviously this was a beginning course, i kinda of laughed at the code now that i see it, but it worked.|`|d5Kc2hxtaa	Well, not that it is that difficult, but it is more efficient to just use a hash table if you only need such a small group of prime numbers. There are only 26 numbers less than 100 that are prime (including 1).    If you're looking for an algorithm that will work for you, I suggest looking online or through just about any C programming book. Prime number finders are pretty common. My buddy writes them in different assembly languages he learns just because it's a simple little problem to solve.    But, if you just want the answer, here is a simple algorithm, and below is the link to learn more abou it:    ArrayList primeNumbers = new ArrayList();    for(int i = 2; i   {      bool divisible = false;        foreach(int number in primeNumbers)          if(i % number == 0)              divisible = true;        if(divisible == false)          primeNumbers.Add(i);  }|`|f9VM4Lkwaa	I won't write the code for you as it sounds like a homework question, but here's the basic algorythm (skip 1, 2, 3 since you know they're prime):    (inside the loop) :  Divide the number by every number between 1 and itself, looking for a remainder each time.  If once comes back with no remainder, it's not prime

Once you have some ideas for X, you will need to create either an interpreter or a compiler in order to try it out.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler    I'd suggest making an interpreter since it is easier to get started that way.    You need to use an existing language in order to write your interpreter/compiler. You could use BASIC, C, C++, C , Java, or just about any other language.    There are 3 main things you will need to do:    - Design your language. Imagine what some sample programs would look like.    - Write a parser for your language. (This is part of your interpreter.) There is a tool called Bison that can generate a parser for you automatically if you can first write something called a "context free grammar" to describe your language's syntax. http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ Using this tool may not be easy if you are not familiar with programming, but you might be interested since the things you would need to learn are very important for creating a new language. :-)    - Create a runtime that can run the code that was parsed. (This is the other part of the interpreter.)    Once your X interpreter is done, if X is complete enough you might even be able to write a new X interpreter -- in X!|`|pP8Q4DWvaa	i aboslutely love the goto function in basic, no need for bools and crap just plain and simple,"30 goto 100", hahaha.

2328Ujd6aa	PHP to design forms?  Remember, PHP doesn't really design forms, it's a server side language.  You still define the forms in HTML and then can use PHP to interpret the results.    For example, a form in HTML would look like this            The form has two inputs, edit1 and edit2.  When you submit the form the form is submitted back to itself (because there is no ACTION specified) so your PHP file could read..  --------------------------------------...    if (isset($edit1))    print "Form submitted here!";  ?>    " name="edit1">  ">    --------------------------------------...  When you submit a form to a PHP page, the name of the inputs gets turned into the name of variables in your PHP page.  Therefore you can use them like $edit1 and $edt2.

Here's the instructions that I lifted from a site I'll link below:    Using Task Scheduler to schedule the computer to shut down and restart at a specific time        * Click Start, Run and type control schedtasks        * Double-click Add Scheduled Task. The Scheduled Task Wizard starts.        * Click Next.               * Under Click the program you want Windows to run, click Browse.               * In the Select Program to Schedule dialog box, locate the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder, locate and click the Shutdown.exe file, and then click Open.        * Under Perform this task, specify a name for the task and how frequently you want this task to run, and then click Next.        * Under Select the time and day you want this task to start, specify a start time and date for the task, and then click Next.        * Type the user name and password to run this task under, and then click Next.        * Click to select the Open advanced properties for this task when I click Finish check box, and then click Finish.        * Click the Task tab. In the Run box, specify any additional parameters that you want to use with Shutdown.exe. Click OK.    Important: In the 10th step, you need to add the parameters for the Shutdown.exe command. To immediately shutdown the system (0 second timeout), the command-line would be:    shutdown.exe -s -t 00    To reboot the system immediately, this command:    shutdown.exe -r -t 00    For additional help, type Shutdown /? at the Command Prompt.

pP8Q4DWvaa	because it is being upscaled from low def quality to hi def quality or SD vs HD. if you install a proper scaler it will look great btw. so to further explain, SD rund at 480 loines of resolution, computer monitor have way more lines depending on your settings, so the image is stretched, a stretched image is a bad image. this is where "upscaling" comes in, perhaps you've heard this term before. this is the post process state where the image is made bigger by some means, typically software. the software calculates and projected what the larger image should look like, the way it works is none of are concern, just as long as it works ;). First lets start by installing this:    http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow/    it's completely free. After you install it go to the video controls, looks something like this:    http://sourceforge.net/project/screensho...    click on resize & aspect, then modify the settings, multiply the image by 2, see the 3 window down:    http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/586/s...    just ignore the setting shown and set "multiple by 2" if your computer can handle it then do it as it shown (not my settings, but they look good). for the first run you might want to click on "OSD" as well, this will show stats on your video as it is playing, so you know it's working, just turn it off after testing.    you can play with the setting as you like, one thing to do is right down the settings before you tweak them, you'll be amazed at the quality change.    once you install this, it will run everytime you play a video, so you don't have to worry about it anymore after you set it up, ffdshow also comes with the audio aspect (different control panel) i usually turn up the bass, that's about it.    like states below it might be your card is too old, but i manage to run ffdshow on a 6180le nivida, or whatever that onboard video on hp's is.|`|kcUfhKwkaa	its ur video card... change ur video card.

It is important to replace it before it DOES fail; should this occur, it is very likely that your processor will be damaged, and then you will not have a functional computer.

Companies do NOT develop projects using toy or designer languages or compilers - it is too risky for long term support.

When MIT replaced its aging TX-0 mainframe computer with a DEC PDP-1, which had a built-in monitor, Russell, Witanen, and Graetz wanted to create a program that would test and tax the new computers capabilities and drew on their love of science fiction in deciding to make a game involving spaceships. Russell was primarily responsible for the design of the game, which was finished in 1962.

Absent that, all i can suggest is going into the Unicode font/character map and verify that you are using the correct code.  Did you update the software for the text/word processing tool you were using?  If it changed, that could explain why it doesn't work anymore.  You could, possibly, assign a macro / hot key process to insert the symbol and stop worrying about the actual unicoding.    It's also possibly you're looking for a fix in the wrong place.  What tool is no longer correctly supporting the display of the copyright symbol?  Perhaps that tool needs tweaking, not the code itself?

781dda71e14507a6610c84713e824c1aaa	Greetings Fellow Californian (I was born and raised in SoCal)!    Excel and Access are an excellent start but may not be sufficient, in and of themselves, to get you into the salary range you want.  I would suggest learning Visual Basic next because, if you have done any programming at all in Access, VB will be a snap.  After that (or concurrently) start learning about MS' .Net technologies.  If you combine programming with web knowledge, you would be much more in demand than with either by itself.    For the web side of things, you would need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, server-side scripting (ASP, ASP.Net, PHP, Perl, CGI, etc.) - not all of them but the more, the better.    Like you, I learned Access (and all of my web skills) entirely on my own.  I think that shows employers that you are industrious and willing to exert the effort necessary to achieve your goals.    Of course, in my case, it didn't hurt that I already had a degree in another discipline, and had taken several programming classes both in and after college.    Best of luck to you!  |`|pP8Q4DWvaa	have you consider getting a comptia a+ certification, you might qualify for free lessons (financial aid) based on income    http://www.comptia.org/

You didn't say how much ram you have, but you need at least 1 gig of ram.    When I played Oblivion on my computer, I had a 3.7 ghz Pentium 4 with 1 gigabyte of ram and a 256 meg Geforce 6800. In order to get anywhere near a stable framerate I had to play in 800x600 with many effects off. Even in that presentation, Oblivion is one of the best games I have ever played.    If $200 is your maximum budget then I have to suggest that you wait and save money, because if you try to play it on that system then you are going to hate it.    You could always save up $450 and buy an Xbox 360 and play it on that. I did not have a 360 when I played Oblivion last summer but I wish I had, because it is a very, very long game and the couch is more comfortable than my computer chair.

Every phone is different in it's hardware. Even though most phones do the same things like use a camera or have a mini keyboard the hardware used still varies and so does the programming for it.     This is why programing phones is kind of difficult because you always have to take the hardware in account for compatibility.     With that said you must  first find a phone that has the right architecture that will be compatible with the  PDF standard and make sure you can find a C compiler for that phone model/make.     Look for a SDK for the phone models..

QUJofAidaa	In 1714 Henry Mill took out the first patent (number 385) for a typewriter in England. Most of the 100+ early attempts at typewriters were in ABC order, and some to enable the blind to write. Then Christopher Latham Sholes of Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA, invented a typewriter in September 1867. As with previous attempts the keys were in an ABCDEFG layout, and the typists soon got too fast and jammed the keys. The key levers hit the platen from underneath and then fell back down under gravity. He didn't think to put return springs on to fix the problem.    Instead he solved this by asking his brother in law to devise a different layout of the keys. Publicly he said it was to put the most commonly used letters far apart on the keyboard to reduce the chances of the levers jamming. The result was Qwerty (the Qwerty layout). Its named after its first six letters: you probably have the layout in front of you now but here it is:    QWERTYUIOP   ASDFGHJKL    ZXCVBNM    The immediate result was people typed painfully slowly with the Qwerty layout. No one could type nearly fast enough to jam the keys, so it appeared his typewriter was working. The other result was it made the typewriter very difficult for typists to learn, which kept them slow. The by-products of Qwerty were to make the fingers travel further to type words, making fast typing difficult, and to help cause the thousands of cases of RSI (Repetitive Stress Injury) that we see today.|`|pP8Q4DWvaa	everything you need to know is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwerty

qa3Id6Diaa	Editors are programs that you type code (text) into, the compiler will take the code typed into the editor, and turn it into a binary executable file.    There are a lot of different compilers, the most common one used by beginners is Bloodsheds Dev-C++, located here: http://bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html    Because Dev-C++'s production kind of stopped, some people picked up the project and continued it with wxDev-C++: http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/    I used Dev-C++ for a while (about 4 years, then wxDev-C++ for about 1/2 year), but have switched to Code::Blocks, i like this editor more so than Dev, it supports having workspaces, multiple projects open at the same time, better code completion than Dev, and can even use the dev-packs to upgrade: http://www.codeblocks.org/    All three of the editors use GCC compiler, they have it with them when you install it, but you can edit them in the options to use different compilers. All three of those are free as well. There is also a free visual c++ released from Microsoft, but i am not sure if it is still free, and borland has a free compiler out too.|`|pP8Q4DWvaa	http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html    this does what you need, it's a compiler and editor and FREE!! it can handle c and c++.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	A compiler turns source code into program code.

Asking the difference is like asking the difference between a car and a Ford.    2) Hands down, Accelerated C++ ( http://sc.tri-bit.com/Moo for the Amazon referral link.)    3) There really aren't any.  C++ is a large language with many pitfalls.  You need a good primer book.  Be aware that most C++ primer books are utter crap; it's important to get the right one.  Accelerated C++ (the link above) is an excellent starting point.

AA11935119	If you are a seller, simply SIGN UP and post your items.   Try something small and inexpensive at first.  You want to gain some experience.   Also, buyers do not like to buy expensive items from someone with no experience.     As a seller, so want to pack and ship as quickly as you can, after payment has been recieved.   You can wait for the bank to clear the check.   When you do a good job, the buyer should give you POSITIVE feedback after recieving your package in good order.    If you have recieved the money, you should immediately give positive feedback to the BUYER.   Don't make them wait, since their part of the experience is done.   Some sellers refuse to give good feedback for quick payment; but that is WRONG.   The buyer has done their part of the deal by sending the payment.   The buyer has no obligation to be HAPPY.    As a buyer, simply BID on an item.  If you win, then make your payment quickly, so you can get an item.  Some sellers will not sell and expensive item from a buyer that has no experience.  So buy some cheap stuff first to get some feedback.      eBay is built on trust.   When you do wrong, nobody will do business with you.     eBay charges sellers to POST items, and a final transaction cost.     Here are some auction sites that are much cheaper.  No posting fees!     http://www.craigslist.com  http://www.bidville.com  http://www.eptop.com|`|AA12101931	Here ya go....  all the answers you want about eBay.    http://hub.ebay.com/buy

In that case, I have a fantasic bridge, low maintainance costs, high volume (great for tolls if you decide to implement them), yours for a mere $1000.    A Mac cannot run most windows programs.  Unless it runs a windows Operating system.  Word has been available on a Mac for well over a decade.    Macs are fine machines... but until apple opens up MacOS to other hardware, it will still be a niche market with few (relatively) software programs.|`|AA10701126	Well there are many pros and cons with both the mac and the pc.     The good things about the mac is that there are hardly any viruses that can infect it, so your computer is pretty immune to them and you dont have to worry about all the security risks.    The cons are that the mac can't run most of the windows programs unless you buy one with a Windows OS which I find pretty pricy.    Pcs can run almost any program that comes out in the market but a whole crap load of viruses are created everyday that can infect your computer, thus causing you to have to heavy up on your security and install all these programs that protect you computer from crap.    The choice is yours on whatever you want to buy. If you're a rich person then go for the mac and if you would rather be able to use most programs then go for pc:)|`|b784c74fa70ee73984c2eac75a964c76aa	PCs are the best for me anyway|`|ec00b48d0d06768d9b8168c04ca27d7daa	Its simple how many people do you know can work on a mac with no problem vs how many people can fix the PC when you run into problems.  that is where you need to look.  If you have friends with macs they can help you out.  If you have more friends with PC then go that way.  It who can help you out when you get into a jam.  All computers fail it just who has your back the most.|`|d133d0e6736ffea45468043fe78e3735aa	Depends on what you plan to do. PC's are better for business, gaming, being able to communicate with other computers and because they aren't exclusive, you can upgrade for less.    Mac's a great for several things too. I have gone to a few places where all the DJing was done on a Mac. Music mixing works great on a Mac too and for graphic imaging a Mac is wonderful. Mac's are great for personal computers that don't play games or need many applications. If you want to communicate in the business world or are a gamer like me, then you want to go PC.

5b5af6b3da29f96612d25a15038ef752aa	Grunds?tzlich kann man natrlich jeden Passwortschutz knacken. Aber es gilt: je l?nger das Passwort und je mehr verschiedene Zeichen drin sind, desto schwieriger wird es. Ab 14 verschiedenen Zeichen aus den Kategorien Buchstabe, Zahl, Sonderzeichen wird es nahezu unm?glich, hier noch was zu tun.    Ich wrde wie folgt vorgehen:    1. Suche im Internet nach Passwort-Crackern in Verbindung mit dem Kompressionsformat, das die Dateien haben (ZIP, RAR oder was auch immer). Vorsicht: man ger?t bei diesen Dingen sehr leicht in gef?hrliche Bereiche des WWW. Eine seri?se Adresse ist diese hier:    http://www.lostpassword.com/    2. Schau Dir die Wirkungsweise der Tools genau an. Oft kann man definieren, wie das Tool arbeiten soll. Wenn Du z.B. einzelne Teile der Passw?rter oder deren L?nge kennst, dann steigen Deine Chancen.    3. Lass das Tool laufen    4. Hab' viel Geduld.

21cafcd3ca89131a99b5c66251514f7aaa	News The project document (the first major milestone) is being written on the java.net TWiki pages. The starting point is:  Your help is welcome. You need to be a java.net registered user to work on the TWiki. If you want to contribute, whether entire sections or just comments, please join our dev mailing list ( If you are interested in coding, write to the dev mailing list with your ideas. See below for more information on the project. Identifying the Problem Writing applications using the Java Swing API is hard. We face a situation in Swing development where the tools available are very good, the API is feature-rich (no, really) but Swing development is both difficult and apparently not as popular as the features available would lead us to believe. For example:  Cross-platform Usability and Display: Why doesn't my app look the same on Linux? Why does this JTable not behave as I expect on this platform? What settings to I need for component  in order for it to behave in such-a-way on Mac OSX? And so on... Threading Issues: Why does this button remained depressed when I click on it? Why is this window taking so long to open? Why doesn't this component refresh quickly? Installation: How do I create an installer for my Swing application? Can I update components individually, across the Web? How to I create an network-updateable Swing application? Capabilities and Expectations: I want my component to act like it does in my other, non-Swing applications--like, why can't I sort this JTable? Localization: How do I support multiple languages in my application? What about timezones and other localization issues? How much work do I need to support this across the app?  ...and so on. Project Goal There is much information about creating high-quality, responsive, cross-platform Swing applications, but not in one place (that I know of). It's scattered in bits and pieces across Sun's Java site, various developer's private websites, commercial developer's sites, articles, books, and on and on. Unless you code in Swing all the time, finding all this, and applying it intelligently, chews up vast quantities of time. And if you don't code in Swing often--you are likely to have forgotten important bits in the meantime. The goal of this project is to collect that information to ease and encourage development of high-quality, cross-platform Swing development easier. The first stage will be to collect, organize, edit and distribute the documentation. Later phases may include bundled super-toolkits and application starter kits to enable rapid development of new applications. I have been thinking about something like this for awhile. About two years ago, I worked on a long contract which ultimately included a Swing front-end as a major component. Development in Swing was ultimately rewarding, but incredibly frustrating as well--I spent many hours scouring the web looking for tips, workarounds, and toolkits to solve problems I faced and to improve usability, performance, and other typical challenges. Although the project itself was a success, and very popular, I left with mixed feelings. Why was Swing development so difficult? Why did we have to start at the ground-level with new Swing applications? Did I have to develop my own set of documentation, notes, API extensions or special GUI components, just to make Swing development worthwhile? This project is here to state, clearly, that all we need to know about quality Swing development is available, on the web, from our colleagues, in books and magazines. It has not, to my knowledge, been collected in one place. Worse, there are number of good toolkits in the open source community which individually are useful, but which together could make Swing application programming awesome--they just need to be brought together in one solid package. Principles To Abide By The project holds to certain principles:  Respect of Ownership: we respect all rights of ownership to intellectual property, written content, copyright and etc., and will not publish written information without the author's clear authorization to do so. Clear Attribution: wherever we know the source of some documentation, that person will be identified as its source in whatever we publish. Others to follow...  Plans and Milestones The project will proceed in various stages, and you can contribute wherever you see fit. The first major milestone--and I mean, major milestone--is to have a website and PDF/DocBook documentation set setup as an easy reference and guide to the information we gather. Separate goals after that will be to release software that itself facilitates development--toolkits, superkits (collections of multiple toolkits), configuration kits, starter applications. Later phases might include ready-to-start applications that can be loaded into popular IDEs that support Swing, like NetBeans. We could even make portions of the information available to IDEs as a plug-in--so that code snipplets, templates and such can easily be used while coding, or documentation can be searched and browsed while coding.

xdlsGvldaa	Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity. It refers to a local area network which uses high frequency radio signals to send and receive data over short distances (approx. 200 feet).    Wi-fi is also written as wifi, WiFI or even WIFI.    Wi-Fi is also the trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, the trade organization that defines the Wi-Fi standards.    Wi-Fi or wireless is used to refer to communicating without cords or cables. It mainly refers to using radio frequencies and/or infrared waves.    Hot spots are areas with Wi-Fi service and are either accessed for free or for a fee. It is possible to purchase access using a metered system or passes good for a certain time frame, such as day, week or month. There may be metered access or with a pass for, for example, a day, month or year. Access can be for a complete chain of locations or just one hot spot. Hot spots can be in bookstores, cafes or airports.  Go to: http://mobileoffice.about.com to find out more.  Hope this helps|`|PV21M5U9aa	Wi-Fi (IPA: /?wa?fa?/) is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, founded in 1999 as WECA (Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance). The organization comprises more than 300 companies, whose products are certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, based on the IEEE 802.11 standards (also called WLAN (Wireless LAN) and Wi-Fi). This certification warrants interoperability between different wireless devices.    The alliance was founded because many products did not correctly implement IEEE 802.11, and some included proprietary extensions. This led to incompatibilities between products from different manufacturers.    The Wi-Fi Alliance tests the wireless components to their own terms of reference. Products that pass become Wi-Fi certified and may carry the Wi-Fi logo. Only products of Wi-Fi Members are tested, as they pay membership and per-item-fees. A missing Wi-Fi logo does not necessarily mean non-compliance with the standard.    In some countries (USA, France, Poland...) the term "Wi-Fi" is often used by the public as a synonym for wireless Internet (W-LAN), although not every wireless Internet product has a Wi-Fi certification. This may be due to certification costs that must be paid for each certified device type.    Wi-Fi certification is provided for technology used in home networks, mobile phones, video games and other devices that require wireless networking. It covers IEEE 802.11 standards including 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n.    Wi-Fi is supported by most personal computer operating systems, many game consoles, laptops, smartphones, printers and other peripherals.|`|Lu918yR5aa	like internet..|`|orIAir11aa	wireless fidelity|`|Cfw0OvLwaa	Wi-fi is short of Wireless Fidelity.Means radio frequency wireless networking standards are specified by IEEE 802.11 committees.    When you implement a radio frequency wireless network, you use radio waves rather than wires to connect your hosts. Radio waves are considered unbounded media because, unlike wires, they have nothing to encase them. The most commonly used frequency for wireless networking is the 2.4 GHz frequency.    Wireless standard :  802.11a Frequency: 5.75 - 5.85 GHz, Speed 54 Mbps  802.11b Frequency: 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz, Speed 11 Mbps  802.11g Frequency: 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz, Speed 54 Mbps    For more information visit this link below:  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2008/12/we-...  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2008/12/do-...    regards  http://yosellin.blogspot.com/

Ns6I7MmBaa	You would need a router capable of ToS (type of service) or QoS (quality of service) queuing.  That can either give certain types of packets priority (like acknowledgment packets) or reserve bandwidth for certain types of traffic.  For example we have a hardware VPN router at work that reserves a certain amount of bandwidth for the VPN and internet traffic can use what is left.    Another example is if you do internet file sharing and uploads choke downloads.  Some sort of queuing priority could give acknowledgment packets priority so they can acknowledge downloaded packets more promptly instead of having to wait in line to be uploaded.

3a3e83cdd82c6f01cb6edf265e614ddbaa	That depends on your OS.    If you're on windows, you can use...    copy %Driveletter%:\ADAM\*.* %DESTINATIONDRIVELETTER%:\EVE\    where %Driveletter% is the original drive letter (ie. C) and %DESTINATIONDRIVELETTER% is the destination drive letter. Most people would have their files on C drive so it would look something like this:    copy C:\ADAM\*.* C:\EVE\    Now, with that code, you're expecting that the folders ADAM and EVE are in the root of C drive. If it's not, you'll have to point where the folder is at.    If you're on *NIX (such as Linux or Unix), you'll use a slightly different command    cp /DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY/ADAM/*.* /DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY/EVE/    Where DIRECTORY and SUBDIRECTORY will point to where the folder ADAM and EVE resides. Your folder may be in the root directory (/) so you may not have to use DIRECTORY and SUBDIRECTORY at all.|`|s8KonZc5aa	Also, if you are unsure how to use a command line function,  type the command then /?    For example:  copy /?|`|LFWWPgpQaa	Copy C:\Adam\*.* C:\Eve\  Assuming they are located at C:\Adam not C:\users\Adam etc.    Other examples  Copy only files with a certain extension  Copy C:\Adam\*.doc c:\eve\    Copy all files and folders inside adam  xcopy (or xcopy32 depending on OS) c:\adam\*.* /e c:\eve (e is for everything)
RyvKws7Laa	Use an asterix, so *.mp3 or *.doc means all files with .mp3 extension or .doc extension (or whatever you want).    You can use the * as a "all" in a variety of scenarios.  Like what if you wanted all .doc files whose first part of the file name was jan (for january)?  Then you could do jan*.doc.|`|T7Apky52aa	I'm not sure you can do it in one line, but if you start in the directory where you have the files you can just say copy *.mp3  or copy *.doc     If you try something like copy *.doc *.mp3  you're going to get a syntax error.    You might look for a copy of DR DOS. That might do the multiple file copy to a target directory that you want to do.

FqrKjtzwaa	You need to have basic math skills - same as any other professional person would need -  but unless you are doing something really specialized, that's all you need.    I'm a good example - I too suck at math (never got better than a "C" USA grade), hated trig, never took calculus, yet for 20 years I've been a successful software developer and software designer.    About the only specialized math skill you should be familiar with - but it is easy - is base 2/binary arithmetic, and hex. But if you don't know these now, just be open to them when you encounter them and you will learn enough as you go along.

0m1PMsHaaa	I assume that you mean compared to a LCD TV.    Most monitors and LCD TVs conform to the VESA standard for wall mounting, so that should not be a problem for either.Looking at Circuit City they have 19" LCD TVs for $280 up, and 19" monitors for $160 up.  So you have about $100 to get a converter.   These seem to be in the $150 + price range, so you are probably better off getting an LCD TV and not having to worry about an extra brick hanging from it to convert the signal.    Most monitors do not have speakers, so that is another $30 and worrying how to mount them.    I would just get the LCD  TV.

5a2XVczMaa	We need more information.... You say your ISP is through the telephone line. Is that Broadband or dial-up internet (both are through telephone line.    But besides that your new laptop will take whatever connection you currently have. Does the telephone line plug straight into your current Dell computer (this would be dial-up). OR do you have a blue cable that plugs into your computer from a separate modem (this is broadband).    Also are you looking at keeping your old Dell and having your laptop as a seccond computer on the internet? (do u want both on the internet?).    Lets say you have Broadband, and a broadband modem, and you want to have both computers on the internet. On the back of the modem (where the blue cable comes from), is there any other (telephone like) holes where other posible plugs can be plugged into. If so then all you need is to purchase another blue plug and connect one end to your modem, and the other to your new laptop.      Hope this helps (and not confuses).|`|zF12F5Hfaa	no u should beable to connect the cat five cable at the back of your computer to your laptop.

If you need more detailed help on how to create a wireless connection you can email me at curtis.stonge at yahoo.com|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Most new laptops include a telephone modem built in. You can check by looking for a phone connector on the laptop (but don't confuse it with the slightly larger but similar connector for network cable - most new laptops will have both).    If your laptop has this, then you will be able to connect it to your telephone line and you will be able to continue to use your ISP as you do now.    BUT... first you will need to set up your laptop to use your ISP - either your ISP will give you a CD to set things up, or they will give you instructions for how to do it without a CD.|`|bc9406bd52867a905118e096a28620efaa	New laptops usually come with an inbuilt modem.

fYrjwcPpaa	I disagree with what everyone is saying. I have about 4 or 5 browsers installed on my computer, and whenever I'm using a browser and search a website, the results do not appear in the other browser. Sounds like you have a virus.     What they mean about Firefox being the default browser is that if you click or try to manually open certain files, Firefox will open it (If you have saved a website to your computer then click it, Firefox will open it). But, that is not the case when you already have a browser open and are just searching a website. There's something wrong with your browser or computer. Since you said that both browsers used to work fine, I'm guessing it's your computer. You have a virus. Sorry.    I wouldn't download anything from mydollarsoftware, the site that jack suggested, or any other "small" software site. I'm not saying that the site jack listed is a bad site, but most of them are. They do more harm than good. Be careful. You should start by doing an uninstall and reinstall of the browsers one-by-one.|`|2jfnj42yaa	You can get rid of your plugins by selecting Tools > Add-ons and then on each plugin select "Uninstall".

After installing do this:    1. Turn off system restore for all drives    2. Close all runing softwares.    3. disconnect all network connection  (LAN/WAN)    4. start scan your system    It will take more then 1 hours but all virus are caught by antivirus  after that you can remove those files or delete manuly    This process provide you 100% relief from this problem|`|33RzCHm0aa	well its best to use norton internet security coz norton sends u the updates almost everyday of some or other type of possible virus.    to your problem if u have installed this army of resistances like antivirus, antispyware... and still you have not got rid of them there are 2 solution  1. search and delete those files that might be the possible carries of those virus  2.

dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|xdlsGvldaa	Microsoft does not have a anti spy ware 2009, this is malware, no key code for this.

T7Apky52aa	Depending on what path you want to take in web design, there's an argument for both the CS degree and a design degree. If you're looking to do the back end work for websites such as MySQL or CGI then a CS degree is the way to go, but if you've got an artistic talent then the design school may be the best way to go.    If you're able to, you might consider taking a class in each at a local junior college so you could get an idea of what each would be without a total commitment either way.    Hope that helps!|`|b5ySK6SGaa	A computer science degree will be mainly concerned with programming computer programs. For web development sometimes a IT degree is enough.     If your considering just web development and graphic, then you should look around for a technical school perhaps that primary is focused on web development and graphics.     Otherwise with a computer science degree you'll find yourself doing stuff you don't want to do because it doesn't relate to web development.

For example, after you assign outline levels, you can work with the document in outline view or in the Document Map.) formats or heading styles (heading style: Formatting applied to a heading. Microsoft Word has nine different built-in styles: Heading 1 through Heading 9.). If you are already using outline-level formats or built-in heading styles, follow these steps:    Click where you want to insert the table of contents.   On the Insert menu, point to Reference, and click Index and Tables.   Click the Table of Contents tab.   To use one of the available designs, click a design in the Formats box.   Select any other table of contents options you want.

d944f11c6b5e9cefb9ec6867a98f71d9aa	The DVD-R DVD+R difference can easily be summarized by the following:    The DVD-R/RW standard was developed by Pioneer, and is used primarily by Apple and Pioneer. These "minus" discs can only be written to in one layer on the discs surface. In addition, this format is supported by the DVD forum, but is in no way an industry standard. DVD-R/RW discs are cheaper than the "plus" format.       The DVD+R/RW format is supported by Philips, Dell, Sony, HP, and Microsoft. These discs can be written to in multiple layers, giving them slightly better and more disc storage than the "minus" format. Because of this additional capacity, they are slightly more expensive than "minus" discs.

615553f1212242f3f2b950f48c10dd7eaa	This is actually pretty easy since you already have all you need.    First, establish your wireless network. Unless your house is very large, you should be able to run everything off of one router. Regardless of how many wired ports are on your router, the wireless portion can support up to 254 devices at once.    If all of your equipment is "still in the box" - not hooked up yet - then first get your DSL modem up and running. Then get your router working using the setup disks that came with it.    Once you have your router and modem working together, then establish your wireless network. Wireless networks can be just as safe as wired if you want them to be. Options include:    MAC filtering (only specific hardware can connect to the network)  Disabling the SSID broadcast (so people will not easily 'see it' when looking for networks)  WEP keys - essentially passwords to connect wirelessly and also encrypting the communications    All of this is found in the router setup. In fact, most routers walk you through these options during the install process.    Once you are able to connect to the Internet wirelessly from all your computers, then you are ready for the next step.    Your Buffalo Linkstation will plug directly into your router, and then your printer into the Linkstation. I would setup the linkstation first just as a hard drive, then add the printer later. Remember, take one step at a time.    Follow the install steps for the Buffalo, and remember that you may need to enter some of the same information about your network that you entered in the router setup.     WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN AS YOU GO!!    Once the linkstation is setup as a NAS, then get the printer setup. All of this should probably be done from the wired computer. Remember, your printer will now be a network printer, so when adding it in Windows, install it not as local but network. For you MAC, it will depend on your printer - you may be able to install it as a network printer if there are MAC drivers, or you may need to install it as IP printing. Yes, your printer will now have an IP address on the network (actually, the print server on the Buffalo does).    Since you have the Buffalo NAS, you probably don't need to do any file sharing between all your machines - just use the NAS as your shared space. (as opposed to opening up files on individual machines for others on the network to access).      Now the only 'problem' in all of this would be if your house is so large that you need to chain your routers together to spread out the wireless signal. This is not as hard as it sounds, but it involve doing some manual settings on the second router so that it is not using/issuing the same IP addresses that the first one is.    Try it first with only one router, and if it works, then put the other router back in the box. If signal is weak, consider getting a booster for the router. If you really need to, then set up your second router. Post another question on that, since it is too much for this post.    Good luck!!|`|g4P0nZmsaa	You can do that, of course, but you may have to spend the money for wireless networking AND you need to understand that your new wireless network will be less secure and more vulnerable to any hacker that drives by with a laptop.  Finally, wireless connections are less reliable than wired.  I think I would just run a wire if it were me.

So go to firefox.com if you use firefox.    I use internet explorer version 7.  it uses tabs instead of new windows which is nicer on the cpu and neater on the desktop.  although you still have the option of opening more windows.      Ahhh, this just came to me.

IE is also a good one and works when Firefox does.|`|fe604fbd41c4024bdda8165e3550432daa	Depending on your browser, try down loading the yahoo tool bar.  On IE 6 it allows you to have multiple tabs for web browsing.  When you go to the link instead of left clicking on the link, do a right click and choose, "Open this link in a new tab"    If you are using Firefox (new version has tab's built right in) right click on the link and choose "Open link in new tab"    Using tabs will allow you stay in one program with multiple WebPages.    Good luck with that.

Try a full cleaning and dis-infection routine, if you are getting excessive popups, or are getting popups even when you are offline.     This is the one I use (it will take some time).    1.

Once you merge this list of sites and domains into the Registry, the web sites for these companies will not be able to use cookies, ActiveX controls, Java applets, or scripting to compromise your privacy or your PC while you surf the Net.

These type of popups will have the words "Messenger Service" up top in the title bar.  This was corrected in Windows XP- Service Pack 2.    Understand that the Windows Messenger Service is completely different from, and not in any way related to, "MSN Messenger", "Windows Live Messenger" "yahoo Messenger", or any other well-known instant messaging system. Therefore, disabling the Windows Messenger service will have no effect upon your use of any other instant messaging applications. They will continue to work without trouble.        To disable this service in older versions of Windows use the free, Shoot The Messenger from:  http://www.grc.com/stm/ShootTheMessenger...    Good luck.

My last drive letter is R:, since each of my card readers counts as a drive, my external drive counts as one, my printer (with additional card readers) counts as another one.

92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	From a programming standpoint .net and java are being sought after in Florida.  (and else where)  They pay well, but with all hot technologies, they may not be in 18 months - two years.  If you are looking to enter into IT, I might suggest some sort of core infrustructure.  Servers, routers, Server OSs, Email, Etc.  No matter what mind of business, no matter what kind of applications, they need to have a base infrustructre.  You may not get the bonus bucks of the hottest areas at the moment.  but you will have opportunities for jobs  2 months, 2 years, and 5 years down the line.

My father does something similar to this, he will download his attachments to his CD/RW drive from his Outlook client.  He has a drag & drop feature enabled and this enables him to view his attachments on his CD.    Works for him, so just a suggestion.    Best of luck!
lqM94CC3aa	you need to put the path to the jdk bin directory in your classpath.  otherwise you can run it by calling /javac|`|AA11396875	all previous answers are good.. but, if you are going to go through the effort of setting up the path, you might want to add it to the system (environment) path.. this way it will always be available in the dos / cmd window... the pedantic way is to:    1) create a system (environment) variable called JAVA_HOME which points to the jdk install directory  2) add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your system path|`|YP6eghRraa	The problem is that cmd will recognize java since it has now been added to the registry. However the java compiler, javac is not. To use the javac you have to find where you installed the jdk, and then find javac.exe. Once you find it save that path as a new local variable. Now in cmd you will be able to use that variable as an exchange for that long address.    A better solution which I suggest is this:  If you're seriously thinking of tinkering or starting java programming getting a good IDE is essential. Try eclipse. http://www.eclipse.org/ This has many tools  that will help a budding java student feel more comfortable with java.     Either method is actually alright in the beginning. Good luck.

DjGEJfaPaa	The easy and quick way to restore file and activity History is the System Restore feature. Since much history is saved into the Windows Registry, restoring it to a previous state will restore file and program History. Revert your computer back to the desired date and enjoy restored History.    If a user has used eraser track programs such as Ad-aware or Spybot, this method will not work and you will need to access the lesser known log files that Windows keeps (the "index.dat" files). Search for "index.dat" on your computer, you will need to download Super WinSpy to view them.    If a user has used advanced tools to erase usage tracks, program logs, registry history and the index.dat files such as CCleaner restore is more difficult. Try using a disk editor to directly access hard disk sector, but even this may not work if the user has chosen the "secure" delete option in CCleaner or has used programs such as BCWipe.|`|76mtgj7aaa	Preferences > History|`|AA11711532	Crtl + H|`|YhBMAUKZaa	Stop watching porn, that's the best way to keep it clean.|`|QjIUu2fzaa	hold ctrl and H at the same time.|`|uGY6p6dwaa	history thing on the top..?|`|Hok7oEJNaa	whean u delte its gone|`|KusvbAC2aa	You've been viewing porn, haven't you?

TID45AZuaa	Yes, everyone, except for protected articles. Everyone can edit and everyone can check any edit. What makes it work is that the vast majority of the edits made improve, or try to improve the article. Always two steps forward, one step backward, but you get a long ways forward with a system like that.    When I am editing seriously I work with a reliable source, say a textbook or other reference. As I read and find interesting information I check out the Wikipedia articles on the subject and, using my reference for a source, add information or make corrections to the Wikipedia article. Much of my editing is done when I find interesting newspaper articles. I favor The New York Times, The Times, The Guardian, and The Financial Times. While they do contain errors and sometimes exhibit bias they are generally reliable. But I use almost anything I read that is authoritative also. I especially like to do original research, but rather than try to sneak it into Wikipedia articles, publish that on Wikinfo.org, unless I happen on reliable published material that contains the same line of thought.|`|AA11386158	If the edits aren't cited thought a regulator will delete whatever you add.

For the number with the right parenthesis after it before each number, keep a counter that starts at zero before the loop and increment it by one each time you print a new line.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	public class Example  {   static boolean isSpecial(int i)   {    int first = Integer.parseInt(((i+"").charAt(0))+"");    int second = Integer.parseInt(((i+"").charAt(1))+"");    int third = Integer.parseInt(((i+"").charAt(2))+"");    int sum = first + second + third;        if(first == second || second == third || first == third)return false;    else if(i%((int)Math.pow(sum, 2)) == 0)return true;    else return false;   }   public static void main(String[] args)   {    for(int i = 100; i      System.out.print(isSpecial(i)? i+"\n" : "");   }  }

h2nPm9bxaa	you just need to put in spaces for Yahoo to show the formula.    it works on sheet1 but not on sheet2?  have you tried it without the quotes? "3790"? is sheet1 text, and sheet2 a number?  you should be able to copy&paste this, and it should just work.    =SUMPRODUCT(--( Sheet2!A2:A1500=3790),--( Sheet2!F2:F1500=0))    or a cell reference to cell A1 with A1=3790 should work  =SUMPRODUCT(--( Sheet2!A2:A1500=A1),--( Sheet2!F2:F1500=0))    now changing the sheet name as a cell reference? i would be interested to see that answer, i never thought about it.  when i tried the indirect() i got a  ref! error.  i know the indirect() didnt have a typo because it worked with the non-array sum() formula.    good luck.    edit-  i went with my slower customary boolean:  this works    =SUMPRODUCT(( INDIRECT("'"&B1&"'!A1:A1500")=A1)*( INDIRECT("'"&B1&"'!F1:F1500")=0))    A1 has 3790  B1 has sheet2    you can change A2 from sheet2 to sheet1  you should be able to work out your formulas with this    edit-  hmm? i cant make it not work.  - try opening up a new sheet to test  - keep it simple.  - Sheet1 and Sheet2 would have just columns A and F filled out you can use just use row 2 to row 7 in both columns, and let the rest be blank (they dont really matter)  - sheet3 copy&paste my 3 formulas into the C column  - cell sheet3A1 would be 3790  - cell sheet3B1 would be sheet2  - then change stuff and watch the formulas work.    if that doesnt work, then go ahead and send me an email.  i will email you what i am looking at.

WS95be3Raa	Don't mind others, they don't know what they're talking about (99.99% of all people here).    I have assumed that what you REALLY mean is the difference between text and binary streams in a programming language (like C++). There are no text files, because all files are stored in binary. Computers simply don't understand anything else.    You are correct. The only real difference is the approach towards a newline character. For example, when you read newline on a Windows machine, you're actually reading 2 characters - Caret Return and Line Feed. In binary mode, you would have to read them separately.|`|3LmXfFoBaa	binary is all 0 and 1|`|AA10537901	Text is with words, while binary...     01101001011100110010000001100001001000...  01110101011011100110001101101000001000...  01100110001000000110111001110101011011...  011001010111001001110011  ("is a bunch of numbers")    (Yes, that code will translate to what is quoted.)|`|s8KonZc5aa	No, \n is just a termination character.  It is usually used in instrument communication (such as between 2 computers or a computer and a piece of equipment) to mean the end of a line.    Binary is just 1's and 0's. The good thing about binary is that it takes WAY less memory, and is much faster to transfer.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	Every file is stored in binary throughout memory. text files occupy more memory and the operating system will take longer to display its content to the output device.    A binary file displays the state of each memory bit that the file occupies and a text file displays human readable strings.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	From a programming point of view, the text file will be ASCII 0-127 characters. Where a binary file will be all values from 0 -255.    Many programming languages differentiate between text and binary. They will even handle read file statements or functions differently depending on the file type set. The text file may deal with the \n automatically where a binary file won't deal with it at all.  A binary file doesn't have a newline since it is just part of the data in the file.    For portability, particularly if you deal with text files from different operating systems, you should read the file as binary and handle newlines yourself since you can have any combination of LF and/or CR line endings. Compare a text file from Linux and Windows and pay attention to how the lines are terminated for example.    Shadow Wolf|`|IkDr7Yk9aa	No, you are thinking of unix vs windows vs pre-osX mac text file formats, which use a different newline character and EOF character.    In general, a text file is human readable in a simple text editor like windows notepad, while a binary file is read by a machine.    It can be tricky, most microsoft word files are binary for example. (open them in a simple text editor and they aren't human-readable)|`|a2ZUE0U5aa	in a binary file it looks something like this    100101001010100101  110101010101110101    In a text file you can make a simple program like this  windows only  right click on desktop and got to new text document  type this    @echo off  md 1 2 3 4 5     then click save as.  you can save as any name you want but make sure your not saving as a text file. Change it to "all types".    Also your name of your file must contain ".bat" at the end of it  example     this is my program.bat    now on your desktop you will have a new file on it.   when you double click it you will get 5 blank folders on your desktop.      that is a simple demo of the difference.     after binary it goes to hexadecimal.|`|AA10446546	yep, that's it.    The difference is extremely important though. If you open a binary file in text-mode; any bytes that resembles of \r\n, \n, \r, or the system's default line-end character might be converted into whatever the programming language defines or might be omitted if you're doing a readline. Imagine opening a zipfile in text mode would corrupt the zipfile.    In binary mode, the file's stream of bytes will be given "as is", as stored in the harddisk.    In some languages, opening a file in text mode would also allow the file to be decoded with the appropriate codec. For example in some languages, there are two ways to open a UTF-8 encoded file: open in binary mode than pass it to the UTF-8 codec, or open in text mode using the UTF-8 codec. In languages that provides this open with codec, handling non-ASCII encoded text file is a wee bit easier.    The difference between opening a file in text mode and binary mode heavily depends on the operating system and programming languages. Some programming languages would try to play smart by handling the line ends from various systems uniformly, other programming languages simply use the text-mode to signify that you want the system default's line ending byte pattern as the separator characters for readline.    The reason why the current state of affair is such a mess goes back to the tty age. ASCII was an encoding devised for tty devices. A tty device needs two commands for a new line: Carriage Return, which will return the carriage (character printer) into the first collumn, and Line Feed, which will roll the paper to start writing in the next row. A single Line Feed command, for example, would start a new row BUT it doesn't return the carriage, so your writing would be somewhat like this:    hell        fae             afae    while using only Carriage Return would print characters over already printed characters. Obviously when tty turns into monitors, this two commands were superfluous. The *nix decided to jettison the Carriage Return in favor of a single LF, the Windows' guys decided to carry on old traditions, while the guys at Apple Macs tries to be different for no reason whatever (actually to be different is their purpose) by using single CR.    I seconded Billy, most people answering this question doesn't seem to have any idea.

wUqeZl3Saa	The hint is bad. If you try to take the simple route and compare only the current and last number, I can create a situation where the state is incorrect for the numbers given. If you try to fix this and limit yourself to just 3 variables you'll give yourself a headache. The logic for it becomes insane.    So, write a program that gets numbers in a loop and terminates on -1. You can print the numbers to prove things are working. Add extra output anywhere you need so you can see what your program is doing. It is trivial to comment it out or remove the extra stuff later.    Next, you need to save the last number entered to determine ascending, descending or no order. You need this for the next part.    Add a section that compares the new number with the last number. Count the ascending, descending and equal/no order comparisons and count count how many numbers were entered.    Finally, when the loop exits, you need to report your findings. The logic for this is a bit tricky, but if you find both ascending and descending numbers, obviously there is no order. The same can be said for having equal numbers.

Once each scan is complete and the malware quarantined, reboot your computer to complete the removal process.    Download, install, update and scan with the following free:    AVG Free from http://free.avg.com/ - this is an anti-virus, ensure that you only have one anti-virus program installed on your computer    You can have multiple anti-spyware/malware/adware programs to scan, ensure they are legitimate.  I suggest the following:    SUPERAntiSpyware Free Edition from http://www.superantispyware.com or download.com    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware...  Valid downloads of Malwarebytes only come from these sites:  http://www.download.com   http://www.majorgeeks.com   http://projects.securitywonks.net     Spybot Search & Destroy from http://www.safer-networking.org - activate TeaTimer and ensure that you immunize every time you update (Spybot S & D updates on Thursday)    Ad-Aware 2008 Free from http://www.lavasoft.com    CCleaner is a good tool to run once in awhile  http://www.ccleaner.com/    Firefox is a much safer browser than IE http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firef...

Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

Torrents can drain a lot of bandwidth if you get a lot of seeders/leechers so most Internet service providers try and keep torrents under control by "throttling" them or, in other words, dropping your bandwidth so your connection is slower while downloading torrents.  Also, I have had a few friends that have received letters in the mail from Comcast stating that if they don't stop downloading torrents there internet will be shut off.      Also, rumor has it, uploading is riskier than downloading because of limited upload speeds and your Internet Service provider may have flagged uploading large files to torrents so be careful.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	well you could get viruses...|`|pqyLfCNVaa	make sure you have a really good virus protection system
SJM0rzHtaa	If these are non-express PCI-classic graphics cards you are buying, be advised you won't see much of an improvement in graphics performance over your integrated stuff.    The old PCI-classic bus transmits data at a mere 33mHz.  That's MUCH slower than even the transfer speed in on-board integrated graphics chipsets, which are directly hooked into either a motherboard AGP (66mHz) or PCI-express bus (at least 1.25gHz).    In fact, you might even see a performance DECREASE.    Remember that PCI-classic and PCI-Express are two TOTALLY different interfaces which are completely non-related, despite the similarity in name.    If you are buying a PCI-Express card, there are plenty of good low-power-draw cards built around current GPUs like a 8600GT which draws under 60W of power under full load, and will work with virtually any system with small 250W PSUs.  (Note the 8600GT has no 6-pin PCIe Power Connector, required for PCIe graphics cards that draw more than 75W of power.)|`|EfM7frb2aa	i am using geforce 6200 by Nvidia since the past 5 years and it has played almost all the games.but i cant get very god or even medium graphics on some newer games.  i have to run games like NFS carbon on low .so that card is REJECTED.  the 8400 GS will be an improvement over the 6200.but you must have to buy a new PSU.  if you dontt buy you wont be able to get all the juice outta ur GPU.  my advice is to buy a 8400GS and buy a new PSU.  buy a second hand PSU of 400W.they are dirt cheap.you can get a psu for 9$ and even half for a second hand.  so buy a second hand PSU also as you cannot do without it.

m0fU0H7jaa	Just as if you were to get your internet from another source, be it DSL, cable or what have you, the best thing for you to do is to setup a wireless router in your home that throws our a range of dynamic IPs.    From this router, you can forward your specific port that you will set in your client, and forward it through your router to make sure you get the fastest speeds possible, and that you are as secure as possible.    Check out http://www.porforward.com/ for a detailed yet VERY simple-to-follow explanation of how to port forward, including the steps necessary to grab a static IP from your router upon which to forward your port to, and then how to login to your router preferences to forward the port proper.    All ISPs send residential houses a single IP [still dynamic], however the router will allow you to turn this dynacism into a static IP for your use as to forward your port.

AA12190407	you have to put your s-video cable into your TV, not the cable top box! you might need an adapter from S-video to RCA or what else analog input connectors you have on the TV.    then right click on the desktop, choose properties and go to the settings tab; 'instruct' your video adapter to use the TV output (or both, if it can).
ehpFAfdgaa	its okay but just beware that there have been bad things happening on the internet with myspace...some kids fight and they'll go to school and get in a fight and some may even get depressed..just be careful and be aware of everything that your child is doing...monitor and make sure you ahve the password just in case something starts to happen.. myspace is really just a place where kids can chat and share there pictures and thought...its a good way for them to let off some steam too if they're upset...if you trust your child and they are happy then you should let them try it..and maybe limit them to however long you think is suited for you and them...i hope this helps!!!|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I think that it all really depends on the child. There has been fights and other things like that started from online discussions but at the same time if they are just talking to friends or just making new ones then there is no harm. So it is just going to depend on that certain child.|`|gVRma7Mxaa	nah im 12 and i have one :)    myspace rox|`|uzsfir0Yaa	no, myspace is fine,  but your not ment to have it till your like 13 or 14 or something,  but i still have one. x)  and as long as the 12 year old doesnt add random people that they dont know, it should be fine! :)|`|VSMMLO62aa	nope! i am 12 and i have a myspace, there is nothing wrong with it!  as long as you keep your profile on private theres nothing to worry about.    unless you write your address on there, but youd have to be pretty stupid to do that.|`|SM7s9KeUaa	well, as long as one stays in contact with their friends through myspace, then its fine.  but if you are twelve, and a parent, just don't let your child download myspace IM.  on IM, you can chat in this chat room, correct?  well, i've had quite the few expereiences in there, i must say haha.  long story short, some random guy sent me a picture of his dicckk, and another guy started stalking me through the internet,  so yeah, as long as you know who your talking to, then your fine. :]
DaAJrdyLaa	I use Blender 3d for creating games.   It has python scripting built in and the logic is fairly simple. Knowledge of coding/scripting is not necessary, but if you need code for something there is an amazing forum with lots of helpful people who can help or may even do it for you.|`|AA10446546	You won't go much far without coding.    Your best bet is to use Warcraft/Doom game engine. You'll be making maps there; and instead of codes, you'll be playing with triggers and actions (which is actually just a more user-friendly wrapper for codes).    Quite distinguished one is Warcraft's game engine, it is extremely flexible, it is possible to create RPG (Roleplaying Game), FPS (first person shooter, CounterStrike-style), and shooting game (in the style of Time Crisis) in Warcraft's engine despite being originally an RTS (Realtime Strategy) engine.|`|pLbTRwNBaa	There's no ONE program to make a 3d game. You need software for coding, software for music and sounds, software for making textures and backgrounds and stuff, and finally you'll need software for 3d modeling of characters and buildings.    www.Adobe.com would probably be a good place to start looking for said software.

12732763cb9e80926a8b8c61107b155aaa	a security suit i cant think of one   but i can give you the best voted free security softwares from cnet    antivirus- avira antivir personal   malware- malware bytes anti malware, best know to be the approved remover of the antivirus 2009 trojan   firewall- comodo firewall pro    with this kit you should have good protection ''  also you can visit www.download.com and check the security starter kit, there you will find a more detailed info|`|dkpIjt5jaa	The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|PvPZYFr5aa	Download, install, update and scan with the following free:    AVG Free from http://free.avg.com/ - this is an anti-virus, ensure that you only have one anti-virus program installed on your computer    You can have multiple anti-spyware/malware/adware programs to scan, ensure they are legitimate.  I suggest the following:    SUPERAntiSpyware Free Edition from http://www.superantispyware.com or download.com    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware...  Valid downloads of Malwarebytes only come from these sites:  http://www.download.com   http://www.majorgeeks.com   http://projects.securitywonks.net     Spybot Search & Destroy from http://www.safer-networking.org - activate TeaTimer and ensure that you immunize every time you update (Spybot S & D updates on Thursday)    Ad-Aware 2008 Free from http://www.lavasoft.com    CCleaner is a good tool to run once in awhile  http://www.ccleaner.com/    Firefox is a much safer browser than IE http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firef...|`|HOq5Urn1aa	You can protect your computer very well with free programs. The best way is to use a combination of anti virus and anti spyware programs          Anti virus and firewall pro  http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d...    or    http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  in combination with  http://www.pctools.com/firewall/    Spywareblaster  http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareb...

Installing these  programs, will not use any extra RAM or CPU usage.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	I have used AVG Anti Virus, Zone Alarm Firewall, Spy-bot Search and Destroy a spyware killer for years. I have recently added superantispyware. They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from http://www.download.com/ I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly. Hope this helps|`|0iURdk6Jaa	my computer was sooo infected and kaperski and mcafee weren't doing enough, so I downloaded super anti spyware and it worked really well!    http://free-pc-software.blogspot.com/200...    i know it sounds scammy but it got rid of the issues that my "real" anti virus programs didn't. It removed some small legit things that were "sharing" info, and it doesn't really like internet explorer (who does?).    Anyway, get Firefox, download super anti spyware and be freeeee.
Wrf5orAuaa	I'm with you. The only ones that have the motivation for creating viruses are anti virus companies.  When you're investigating any crime you always look who benefits, and all the fingers point the one way.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Legitimate Companies with a reputation do not malicious criminals make them.    Viruses are all about the money at least these days.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	The point is to steal your email addresses, send spam and money scam emails from you to your contacts, and with spyware to steal your information. Apart from this every would be computer genius uses scripts posted across the internet from other such idiots to prove how clever they are, when most of them could not hold a computer job typing letters. A clever spyware is the biggest risk, it can download and install more and more other junk, and pass out any stored information, divert you to incorrect sites in order to read your user names, passwords and credit  card details, then send this information to the originator, who will sell it on to others who steal all your life. The current trend of pushing rogue anti-spyware is successful due to fear, people buy it, then it installs other software to send out your details, plus they have your credit card details.Serious virus software companies do not create the viruses. Take a look at the number of companies offering free protection, they gain nothing.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	what a business, huh|`|SRF2FiWPaa	--- I wonder about that too -- how many people could program 2 + 4 + X = Y in B.A.S.I.C. computer programming language . how many could make a simple machine language program. I think only movie evil geniuses would have the technical knowledge to beable to do so and with that knowledge I then wonder about their motive. Why would they do it.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	You don't have to go to the trouble of making a virus to scare people into buying your software - there are enough real viruses out there already. Also there is a class of software called "scareware" that is intended to make you *think* you have a virus so you will buy it. Similarly, a lot of popups on websites pretend to look like virus warnings so you'll click and end up downloading their crappy software (or worse, download actual viruses - but ones that someone else made).|`|oxpFg7L7aa	i think maybe some of them.. it's the logic of creating an anti-virus to create a virus.. lol... hope i make some senses..but maybe some of them don't.. im not really sure.. but hackers and evil-minded and fame-oriented persons do that..|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	i just had a virus that would pop-up (and really look like a virus scanner) go through my files, and say "we found x, y, z click here" and i never bought the stuff, but just by clicking on it my PC got messed up    I dont really think it was anti-virus software, so much as a scam, like any other scam....the people who create viruses, are the same people...nevermind, this is an open forum and i don't want them attacking me|`|k7ER7yRaaa	To answer your question simply: yes. There are some companies that develop viruses that infect your computer and subsequently advertise their anti-virus software. However, said companies are not very reputable at all.     It's best to stick with Avast!, McAfee, or Norton.    Many of the other virus' I know of are used to steal personal information for Identity Theft.    EDIT: As one of the other posters said, It's called "Scareware". Not so much "companies" as much as illegitimate websites trying to scam you.|`|VN2m6XHXaa	The point is to piss people off. That's small time jerks.  The other more serious do it to attack Companies such as Banks, Finance Companies and Microsoft, Apple etc etc.  They are anarchists who detest success.

VUK77SrXaa	You shouldn't be having that much problem getting a good signal from 30 to 40 foot away.  What are the intervening walls made of?  If they are concrete and/or metal that's probably your problem.  You'll need to get a new network connection installed near your computer.    If they are standard wood studs/dry wall, with little/no insulation/soundproofing you should be getting a better signal.  If the walls are at an angle so that the signal isn't just traveling straight through, then that could be your problem.  You can try repositioning where your computer and/or wireless router is so that the signal goes through the walls directly and not at an angle.    Lastly, if the walls aren't concrete/metal, a network booster or high performance antenna should help.
