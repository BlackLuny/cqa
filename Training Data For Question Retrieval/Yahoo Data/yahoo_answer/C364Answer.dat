83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	Now is an ideal time to start, before the main spring growth spurt. You can source and collect your products, and then prune them. Pruning is the best tool for production of great roses, as it really introduces vigour to them, focusing their energy into the shoots that you can get blooms with maximum quality, rather than lots of weaker growth and smaller, poorer flowers. Destroy any prunings that may be infected with anything, as this would transfer to the new growth. Likewise, collect fallen leaves from around your plants, as these can harbor spores etc.  For good growth, i would mulch with well rotted manure, which will keep the roots moister, and release nutrients. Ensure there are no competing weeds too.   You can keep pests at bay with environmentally safer products. Aphids and fungal problems are the most wide-spread issues. Aphids can be killed with insecticidal soap, sprayed on. Black spot and rust prevention is best started early too, and you can use diluted baking soda to help with this and mildew, or other treatments. Foliage and bloom quality will all affect your show results, so attending to foliage is important.   Hope this helps. Good luck!

Roses also like Epson Salt sprinkled around them as well as Evergreens.|`|TrrL22p9aa	If they are growing outside. Now is a good time. If you don't get a rain or snow melt once every two weeks, put about 1/2 gallon water on each plant so that the roots will grow during the winter. That will give you a good start in the spring.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Now is the time to prune roses. Prune not only to give shape, but pruning encourages the new shoots and all energy spent growing will go into the new shoots and produce better roses. A good fertilizer with a high phosphorous rate will also encourage better blooms.
WEzv0n0Baa	You can try putting the buckets in warm or hot water with the outside one in the heated water. the hot water should expand the outside bucket allowing the inside colder one to come out.     Give it a try!|`|Fw7a7P3Vaa	maybe try putting them outside (if its cold where u are of course) the plastic might shrink/get hard and itll be easier??|`|t1NTGuIZaa	either of the two above temperature suggestions works, I have done both before.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	You could pop a small hole in the bottom just big enough to insert the filler needle for a sports ball.|`|AA12181625	LMAO ha,ha,pry-bar.if the outer bucket is expanded its likely staying stuck.
nf3b6l1Baa	Well, if you reside in between Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky -   wait until the snow thaws.  A lemon is a tri foliate that detest freezing weather.  Be sure to cover him well until the last frost to prevent the juices from flowing and freezing the little fellow to death during spring thaw.    Now if you reside where the snow doesn't fall and the weather doesn't drop below freezing, the little fellow just needs some rest from the shock of transplanting.  His little roots are all crammed and cramped inside a small ball.  Dig him up.  Spread out the roots so they have room to grow, soak up nutrients, and flourish.  Otherwise, the roots will remain entangles and choak themselves to death as fast as they grow.  Sure and sudden death will absolutely result if the root ball remains all balled up.  If preferable, do one side at a time. Allow a few days for recovery. Do another section. Repeat as necessary until sprouts spring out on the top section.    Hope this helps and does put a sour taste in your mouth real soon as the fruit flourish with juices aflow.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	don't over feed it , but with the yellow leaves give it a dose of epsom salts, it contains trace elements|`|OBA3Iciraa	if there are buds it sounds like it's doing ok.
nf3b6l1Baa	Go to the local College or University and post a "rental needed" on the public bulletin board.  State all requirements. Space needed. Time requirements. Max amount.  Take care to avoid signing an annual contract, unless desireable.  Specify preferred location or section of city.  Specify preferred number and type of roommates, if any.  Specify what type "pets" are involved.  Specify what type "pet peeves" are important.  Don't be bashful.   Detail if petting is allowed and what type is preferable!!!!!!!    Good luck and God bless.
GWoW1o5oaa	Check the valves.  Sometimes there is another valve in the basement as well    Bleed the entire system.  Might have air in the lines.    If it uses zone valves, they may not be hooked up correctly, have failed or the thermostat is not set correctly/failed    Clogged pipes.  Happens if new radiators are installed with old pipes.  The system should have been flushed when the new equipment was installed if new pipes were not installed    If it is at the end of the line the boiler might not be large enough or the pump is too small or failing.|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	Try and bleed all your radiators there might be an air lock somewhere else we had this problem and it was rectified by doing this|`|0UHI7CoRaa	the radiator probably needs "bleeding" where you slightly open the valve at the top to let out the compressed air that gets trapped there.    Be careful, the Air is usually Hot and you need to tighten the Valve back up as soon as water starts to spill out.    Hope this helps :D|`|tJuEjOzGaa	we had same problem.. air lock ..turn heating off and bleed all the radiators|`|aCdya2qkaa	Bleed it and smack it hard with a spanner.

2WwfS4x4aa	everyday i just make beds, do dishes, take care of garbage and do at least 1 load of laundry so i dont get behind on that..and then i do one full cleaning once a week and that includes vaccuming, cleaning shower, tub, toilet, floors, and dusting....|`|uG8yLnUWaa	If I knew the answer to that one!!!    As a mum of a 4 year old and an 18 moth onld I know where you are coming from!! I seem to spend all day just re tidying the same things over and over...    forstly, start teaching the 4 year old about packing away their toys. We have just started a pocket oney system whereby he gets rewards for little chores he does (nothing to big, just things like tidying away his toys and keepng his book case tidy, putting his shoes away and dirty clothes in the basket.) He gets rewarded for chores done and anything not packed away gets put in a box and he must "buy" them back with his pocket money. We are getting there slowly.    I also work on a roster system with the housework. Monday i iron, Wednesday is for floors vaccuum & mop, Saturdays is for bathrooms. If I manage to get any extra done, then "yay for me" but I must complete the chore I have set.    I was told when my oldest was a baby to make sure that if I do nothing else before I go to bed at night, make sure the kitchen sink is cleared of dirty dishes and the rest of the kitchen is tidy. And it really does work! There is nothing worse than waking up to a sink full of dirty dishes. It helps if throughout the day you rinse stuff as you go.    And lastly, understand that for a very long time, your home is no longer going to look spotless 24/7! And you know what? It doesn't really matter! Don't let housework get in the way of the precious time you get to spend with your kids - you have the rest of your life to clean, but only a short time when your kiids are kids. Do what you can, when you can and just close the door sometimes and don't look!    :)    :)    :)|`|28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	My daughter-in-law deals with 4 children daily.  We have been working on that problem too.   Basically do side chores (not daily chores) by priority each day, because you have so much other stuff to do.    Of course there are things that have to be done without question.....dishes, laundry, straightening up, meals etc.      Do a chart for one major or semi-major thing to be done say twice a week.  And don't think about it, or you'll talk yourself out of doing it.   Just do it.  EX: sorting or organizing     Also believe it or not you can somewhat make cleaning fun.  Turn up the music or just sing.  Your 4 year old can help you with some of the chores.   I know how difficult it is to have the little one help with chores, but with your patience and consistency he will get the hang of it and eventually take the pressure off of you.  In the meantime it teaches him responsibility.  Besides kids at that age absolutely love helping !      Another tip...each time you leave an area pick something up that goes to the area you are going to...or isn't much out of the way...or is on the way.      Make an effort to make the 4 year put his trash where it goes...consistently.  Make him either give your dishes to you every time or clean it off himself.  Put his clothes where it goes...every time !   You might not think this is possible, but be consistent and persistent.     And please be sure and put the kids to bed so they get plenty of sleep.  4 year old needs 10-12 hours sleep.  This gives you more 'me time'      A HUGE key is being consistent with the kids and with yourself.    Make things fun when you can...for yourself and the kids.|`|WEzv0n0Baa	Try the 15minute rule, just work 15 minutes on a project each day or twice a day what ever works for you and you'll be surprised by the amount you can get done. The object is do a little every day,and get results.|`|285cdf0f42a5ad1b82e6756c69e8c768aa	You could try looking at flylady.net for helpful hints, etc. I  wish you the best. Take care.|`|bqttY7msaa	This is a problem that all mothers will relate to!  However, there are ways and means of overcoming the daily mess that confront us when we try to maintain a clean and tidy home.  What I did, as a mother of two active boys, was to label one bedroom as a "mess room", meaning that my kids were allowed to be at their most creative selves.  I had small tables, pens, paints, paper, board games, Leggo, marbles, toys etc at their disposal in that one room...they could be at their messiest, most creative moments, making as much mess as they want...but at the end of the day, they had to clean it all up.  They were told that they were not to bring their toys, paints, Leggo etc. out of that room because "Mummy wanted the house all nice and clean".  They got the message and confined their artistic/creative talents to that "messy room".  Sure, that room had walls marked with paint, pens and pencils, the floor was stained...but when my kids grew up and moved on to teenage pursuits, I was able to get in that room and repaint/redecorate it to my heart's content.  Hope this helps.
BVJBY4eQaa	Old wives tales are a major cause of most repairs that leather technicians go out to fix and hairspray and solvents are the most common. Taking notice of these untested/unproved old wives tales could cost you a great deal of money if it goes wrong.   Just repaired a very expensive jacket that had been virtually ruined by using hairspray to remove ink. It did not remove the ink and left a far worse problem to solve.    Successful ink removal will depend on the type of leather you have, please see the following:    http://www.lttsolutions.net/whatkindofle...    For ink removal:    Ink Removal  Removing ink from leather is not a cleaning problem.  Most ink removal products will not work simply because of the length of time the ink has been on the leather.    Ink is a dye and has re-coloured the leather (this is what it is meant to do)  The longer the ink has been on the leather the harder it is to remove because it soaks into the finish. Once it has soaked into the finish you have to use very strong products to remove it, which will also remove finish and pigment which then need replacing.    Pigment/Protected leather  If the ink is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an LTT Ink Stick. The fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it. It is a good idea to have one in your house if you have pale leather and children!!!!     Old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish. This is probably best left to the experts    If an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts.    You should also be using LTT Leather Protect on your suite. This will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off.    You will see many people recommending household products to remove ink  this is not recommended as most simply will not work, some may appear to work but the damage they cause can make a much bigger problem which is then un-repairable (even by a technician)    DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING:    Hairspray - This is very risky as it can make the matter far worse by spreading the ink over a bigger area and can sometimes then be impossible to fix.   Nail Varnish remover/solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and this will then need replacing, and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather.   Baby wipes  just about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it.   Milk or Toothpaste - these are just silly ideas that will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish on your leather.   Silicones/furniture polish  should not be used on leather. They will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather itself and will eventually break all the finish down and cause it to crack.   Hide food will not remove ink and will leave residues on the leather which will attract dirt and oils.   Most leather cleaners will not remove ink unless a very good leather protector has been used on a regular basis.   Magic sponges or erasers (Mr, Clean Magic Erasers). These have been tested by experts in the leather industry and have found to do a lot of damage to certain finish types on leather.    Aniline Style Leather  As aniline style leathers are largely absorbent it means that the ink will have soaked straight into the leather itself. This makes it impossible to remove. No product will successfully remove the ink.     DO NOT try ink removing products on aniline style leathers as most will leave a greasy residue which will then cause another problem.    Because aniline style leathers are absorbent the ink will carry on moving through the leather and may become less obvious over time. Cleaning and protecting will also help to dissipate over time|`|3W18HDxxaa	WD-40 will remove ink,    spray it on a rag wipe it on wipe it off

xHOpRlfvaa	Well, these are really cool. As a matter of fact I had a friend, when I was a kid, that had a home that backed up against the woods and his father helped us build a really cool cubby house in the woods.    Since my dad was in construction, we ended up have the best built cubby house with the best materials around. It was lots of fun.    For you there is a very good website with complete instructions including a material list that you could use as a basis for what you want to do. You don't have to make yours look exactly like this one but there should be enough there to get you going. Plus this one is built within a swing set, which for you may be optional.    Just click on the following link to see for the information and you can even print it out.    http://www.scribd.com/doc/3927818/200010...    I hope this helps. Rick
AA11739538	could be the fan motor. but there is what is called a start capacitor on the motor that helps give the motor a little extra juice when it first starts then drops out of the circuit after the fan reaches it's speed. Some even have run capacitors that kick in after the start capacitor kicks out. but I would start with that.   the green wire was just a ground and I doubt that had anything to do with your problem|`|ww12lItvaa	Most likely it is a bad fan motor if you have to push to start it. Only rarely do I ever see the capacitor go bad without the motor being bad.    The green wire is only for running the house fan and unrelated to the outdoor unit.|`|d3a0051575f0ca9e98fa14121e4cf6e8aa	Sounds like the fan may need replacing. (if it works when you help it to)
iAFQPknoaa	I assume it's a heater garage?  Perhaps over-heated?  Warm air holds more moisture than cold.  When warm air bumps into a cold garage door, it is cooled and gives up a percentage of the moisture, making condensation.  The warmer & more humid the garage, the more condensation will form on the cold door.  If you are running a humidifier, that will compound the problem.    If there's a heat register in the garage, try closing it part way. Either that or find an insulated garage door or insulate the one you have.    More: whoever mentioned the bad heater vent had a good idea.|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Stick a carbon monoxide detector in that garage and see what it says. This really sounds like your furnace vent or water heater vent doesn't go outside, the gas gets into the garage, flue gas has a ton of water in it and that condenses out on the cold garage doors.  There could be other explanations, but if this is it then it is very, very dangerous and you need to get it fixed.|`|IXlSrkyiaa	Water.

944iJNAdaa	Fungus gnats are a common indoor plant problem.  They feed mainly on organic-rich potting soils, but they'll eat roots on tiny seedlings too, especially before roots have had a chance to grow deeper, where it's harder for fungus gnat larvae to feed on them.  If you can let the soil surface dry out a little between waterings, that will go a long ways towards fungus gnat control.  Other controls include adding a mulch of sand to the soil surface, and the biological control Predatory Nematodes watered into the soil surface every few weeks.  Fungus gnats are an annoying problem, but they often don't cause that much real damage, so you might find you can live with a small population, too.|`|kK2mecABaa	Knats are bad M-kay  What you need is "hot shot no pest power strip"  its 5 dollars at wal mart.

I used liquid Ivory soap ...  1 part soap and 10-15 parts water.    Just enough soap that won't hurt the plants, but enough soap that it coats the wings to keep them from being able to fly and breathe...then they die.    I haven't seen them since I sprayed.     Good luck !  Sharon
Q1nsC8Lgaa	I would tare it off if it was own house.  You might be able to float the siding over the old wil a foan backed siding, then you have to pack out the windows and doors because the " J " chanel is about 7/8" proud, but i would still tare it off|`|hBFSQ9bbaa	i would take the shingles off.|`|AA10408696	you can install right over the shingled siding, my brother from CT just did it, looks nice,|`|GwzGZgxHaa	You need to remove the wood shingles in order for the vinyl siding to sit correctly.|`|AA10613846	I'm assuming that you have cedar shake shingles. To overlay or not.....that is the question. It really depends on what's beneath the cedar shakes. If you have a good nailing substrate like plywood, OSB, etc. and there are no major bulges etc. in the shakes, go ahead and overlay them. However, if you don't have a good nailing substrate, cedar is not a good nailing surface (they split, crack, etc.). As someone else pointed out - if you overlay, expect to pack out the door and window jambs because of the J-channel which goes around them. To have the J-channel sticking out past the jambs would be unsightly as heck. You could use what's called "fan-fold insulation" behind the new siding. Between that and the existing shakes (if you do overlay them) you'll have a nice insulating factor.

Cut the brown leaves off and cover the plants with straw around the leaves (blades) and cover the top of the plant with sheets or cloth but never plastic it attacks the cold when you know its going to be cold. It gets down to freezing even in the dessert so it may take awhile but it may come out of it. I would try and protect it more when you hear the weather man say it's going to be that cold in the future.

gFHTcIc8aa	When I first started my lawn care business I had a basic idea of how to cut grass and fertilize and that was about it.     I took some night classes, networked with more experienced LCO's, and I've made so many improvements I can't list them all in this page.    Some examples:  everything from identifiying different weeds and pests (certain weeds are much easier to get rid of than others, even with the best spray, best thing to do is to keep up with maintenance early and often, especailly in spring), to soil characteristics, to irrigation methods, to interpeting soil test results: Phosphorous Soluablity and PH buffer of a given soil. For a $10 soil test, you get about $100 worth of information.     Proper recycling of clippings and mulching beds (mulching blades and decks better shred grass which will make decomposition of clippings easier and add "fertilizer" (P) to your lawn), cutting grass at proper intervals can make a dramatic improvement in lawn health, reseeding of lawns (best time to reseed lawn is in the fall to avoid crabgrass)are some others.  State of the art enviromentally safe practices and IPM as well.    I will pass along this knowledge to my customers as well and make them informed.  The overall improvements in their yards and plant health have been the best results of all.    Only wish I had done this sooner.|`|16e864c8723d0a5a347f97a0ac5d3c6faa	DIG IT|`|c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Oh, yeah! Especially gardening! The best hint I know now: the gardening season does not begin in the spring. It starts the previous fall when you prepare soil and set up compost pits.    Also, one layer of newspaper doesn't cut it -- go for at least four or five, and a nice pile of grass clippings.     And, citrus likes coffee grounds. Feed 'em coffee, and they are happy plants!

ACIp8lZqaa	Here is Mikey's 2 cents worth. I used to do various seeds myself. I found that sowing them at any given time was not really the issue. Maybe so they were not root bound by planting time...........  I always did my Marigolds , Zinnias and such around now actually. Then come about 2 months they were mature enough and the outside environment was also ready. Sowing time is not of GREAT importance.  The most important is that all signs of a frost have past and the soil temp. needs to be around 60 degrees. Soil temp is the key.  They will sit there and not do much so don't be impatient. When the conditions get better thru the growing season then they will do their thing.  Another key is fertilizing. Be VERY careful. The roots and mass are very weak and can't handle a lot until they start to get some size.  Also the seedlings are more susceptible to over watering right know as well so let them come close to drying out before watering.|`|nSQhVRGZaa	Actually......you sow them and then place in the fridge for about 6 wks - then take them out and they'll think winter is over and it's time to grow. That duplicates their natural process.  They can take up to 2 wks to germinate after that they've been chilled.

gFHTcIc8aa	Buy a mower with mulching blade(s).  They will automatically grind clippings to very fine pieces which makes it easier for them to decompose rapidly.    Grass clippings contain phopsphorous(P), an essential element for grass growth.    If you cut your lawn at correct times (every 5 days during peak growing season, 7-14 days at other times) there will be no need for bagging & disposal , thus you are saving time and hassle.    You will still need to add fertilizer with Nitrogen(N) and Potassium(K) during the growing season for optimum growth and health, but you will not need to apply a fertilizer with P. P is easily stored by soil and unless you have very sandy soil, you will build a healthy level of P in your soil by mulching clippings.     You also want to check the PH of your lawn as well and periodically add Calcium to lawn once a year.  This can be easily done with lime.  Lime will also raise the PH of your lawn, which is often beneficial.    If you want to know exactly what the level of the essential growth nutrients are above you can have soil tested by a lawn care company or take a sample of soil to local co-op extension.  It usally cost between $10-$20.  The results of which will give you a much clearer indication of the levels of nutrients you need to add.|`|03sLrNPCaa	You can mix most any other plant material, including vegetable and fruit scraps to the grass to build compost.  You need to include a portion of "browns" (dried grass, dead leaves, hay or straw, or even news print) to the "greens" (green grass and vegetable and fruit scraps).  There are various opinions on the ratios but generally you should keep the amount of greens below one third of the total.  You can simply put it all in a pile in the back yard or a hole in the ground, keep it moist, mix it from time to time to aerate and be patient.  Lots of composting sites on-line where you can get more complete info.|`|Aw450Og7aa	first you dig a pit up to 1meter depth in soil the length and breadth of the pit will be according to availability of cut grass. add cut grass, decomposing microbes and cowdungslurry with water in to the pit, layer after layer upto 1 feet above ground-layer. close the pit by using cow-dung slurry so that it looks like a dome and leave it for 1 month give turning and again by closing leave for 1 month. now the fertilizer i.e. compost will be ready|`|llT8Prtiaa	add them to your compost bin.|`|MhgLNm3daa	Grass is loaded with nutrients, but the material in a lawnmower bag is not easy to compost.  Grass clippings tend to contain lots of water.  When they start to decompose, they release the water and turn into a slimy mass.  The slime shuts out oxygen, the material smells foul and breaks down slowly.  The grass effectively pickles itself, and it can take a very long time to compost.  Mixing it with fallen leaves will absorb the excess water, let oxygen in and make nice compost.  But I don't find that the grass from a lawnmower bag to be easy to mix.    The perfect solution is to feed it all to a cow and gather the manure.  Scattering the material in a chicken pen works well- the chickens will scratch the slimy lumps apart and add rich manure.  Unfortunately, chickens like to eat wild onions, which make the eggs taste bad.    The easiest solution is to spread the grass clippings as mulch.  They will take more than one season to release their nutrients, but in the meantime they will keep the soil moist and choke out weeds.  Just make sure there aren't too many seeds in the grass.|`|hbLz0oVNaa	visit this link:    http://livinggreenandsavinggreen.blogspo...

Winter grass does not grow seeds.

iWM3zqwUaa	Although Laminate floors are tough, you should follow these directions to keep them in good shape.  ? Remove loose dirt by using a non-beater bar vacuum or a dust mop.  ? With a damp mop or cloth, clean your laminate flooring once a week with a vinegar solution (1/4 cup of white  vinegar to 2 gallons of clean tap water) or a nonabrasive household cleaner, such as ammonia and water  solution. Do not saturate the flooring.  ? Do not use abrasive cleaners, steel wool, soap-based detergents, waxes, polishes, or scouring powder as  they may scratch or dull the flooring surface.  ? Wipe up spills immediately. Avoid allowing liquids to stand on your flooring.  ? A more frequent dust mopping or vacuuming schedule may be required in high traffic or sandy areas.  ? For tough spots, such as candle wax or chewing gum, harden the spot with ice and then gently scrape the  spot with a plastic scraper. Even a credit card will do. Be careful not to scratch the flooring surface. Wipe  clean with a damp cloth.  ? Do not use any type of buffing machine.  ? Use protective mats at the entry and exits to help collect the dirt and moisture that could damage the laminate  floor.  ? Use floor protectors or glides under furniture legs.  ? Frequent vacuuming using a non-beater bar will pick up dirt and grime.|`|6uEmRe7Naa	I found a great resource for cleaning laminate floors!

I just use a mop that is well wrung out so it is just damp. You do not want to wet floors. I sometimes buff up with a towel attached to my swifter. Soap-based products and citrus based products leave a residue on laminate making them look dull. It may take a few washings to get rid of the film.

Alternatively you should have a drain off valve near to the boiler, and / or on a ground floor radiator which you attatch a hose to and release the water. If you do this, bleed all radiators afterwards. Then if the system still fills and gains more pressure, you probably have a faulty filling loop. Even if something has gone somewhere else, the water should not get past the loop unless you let it. In this case, call out a corgi registered plumber asap before your system goes pop! If pressure stays steady then you should be fine. It is normal for the system to lose a little pressure over time due to evaporation and change in temperature, but if you are losing pressure regularly you most likely have a leak somewhere. If so, again, call the plumber. Hope this helps!?    P.s, don't call British Gas, they are extausionate and incompetent! Use you local family run firm, but preferably under recommendation!

One argument is that you are not changing the 'installation';   just one of the 'accessories' ie you are not making changing to the permanent wiring. From a pragmatic point of view it should make no difference provided that the wires are as tight as before.     As I get paid to do it, then yes I would do a MWC. If it were a favour (friend/ self/ family) then I'd just test for my own peace-of-mind.|`|20226e6187d57d2742c7b865538fa529aa	The value of a MWC is so that changes to the installation are recorded. However there is only any value in doing so if the state of the existing installation is known. If all you are doing is replacing a socket cover for aesthetic reasons, with no modification to the wiring beyond disconnecting from the old terminals and reconnecting to the new ones, then I'd argue that an MWC could actually be misleading in the sense that it might imply that the existing installation had been checked for safety/compliance to regulations when in fact you hadn't done so.    If you are doing something as an unpaid favour for a friend then personally I would look upon this as being the same as him doing it himself - would he fill in a MWC if he did it himself?

I40vnqNyaa	My top hints for buying anything (especially big ticket electrical items like flat screen TVs, fridges, washers, dryers etc and even new cars) and getting a good, no make that fantastic deal are.     Think about and then decide what  it is you're after and the features you're likely to need or want in "the product".      Then decide how much you want or can afford to spend.    Next, do your homework. Check out what is out there and which product/brand you think suits you best. Ask friends. Use the internet. Compare features and price in different brands. Visit forums and see what other "purchasers" are saying about the product your interested in. This is very important as people are very vocal about products that don't live up to their hype or products that are generally no good. Forums give you the opportunity to hear about and ask questions regarding the problems your product might have and how happy or reluctant the manufacturers are to deal with them.    Find out where the product is manufactured and weigh that up against the price and the sort of product you are buying. e.g something simple like a toaster is different to say a $2000 washing machine. Product reputation is important but check they haven't changed their manufacturing base recently as this changes things considerably. Often if this happens the quality suffers.    Once ive decided on the brand, when it comes to the model, I never buy the cheapest but you don't always need the most expensive either. Middle of the road is usually the best, often times top of the line will have features you may never use.    Remember. Its important to buy things from retailers that will return products without a fuss if they are DOA or fail in a short period of time.  Don't even bother with the ones that don't.    Once you have decided EXACTLY what you want (brand and model) then its time to shop around. First canvass local stores by phone, most wont give you a rock solid price over the phone (some will) but a ball park price will narrow it down for you.     Then, visit the 2 or 3 stores that offered the best price. Be confident, know exactly what you want. (i.e brand and model number) Let the salesperson know you already know what you want and your only here for their best price. Use other retailers price to knock their price down.    Once you've hammered out a price then its time to talk warranty. Get them to throw in extra warranty or free bits and pieces to go with your purchase to seal the deal.    Without a specific product in mind this is just a generalisation but I always get the best price using this method and im often amazed at the things they will say yes to. Ive saved many thousands of dollars.  Sometimes its hard to keep a straight face, but it always works.     Good luck with your purchase.  :)|`|dXrHoLMCaa	one other biggie.... how easy is it to find good service for it if it breaks?.... and do you need the  contract insurance for that?....

2zEGBgL1aa	the previous post explains the operation of the gas safety valve pretty well, however it doesn't measure resistance directly, it actually measure current flow through the glow bar.  the current flow is directly related to it's resistance.  if the current flow is not within a certain range then it won't open the gas valve and keep it open.  there could, however be enough current to get the bar glowing, it just might not be hot enough for reliable operation.  i manage apartments, and maintain about 20 gas ranges.  i have yet to have a gas valve go bad (but i'm sure it will happen eventually, i could just be lucky)  but i've replaces 6 glow bars over the past 5 years, and that always fixes the problem.  and they would all glow red, just not red enough.  i usually find the glow bars i need on ebay for about 16 bucks.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Probably the oven safety valve, which oddly enough is bad on my oven.  Mine is like $120, so..... right now, I don't have an oven.    The oven safety valve "looks" up the ignitor circuit.  It requires a certain resistance range to turn the gas on.  This works because as the temperature of a conductor increases it's resistance goes up.  It works on a reistance range because if you break it, the resistance goes to infinite, which means the glow bar can't be hot.  If the resistance is too low, it knows that too is no good.  I doubt your glow bar is bad since its getting hot enough to glow, but before spending the money, maybe you would want to try redoing the ceramic nut connectors.  A bad connection could also be throwing the ranges off.|`|nYBsbm4haa	Make sure you have turned the knob to the light position first. Then turn the knob to the desired heat setting after you have a flame. If you have recently cleaned your range, are you sure everything is dry? Moisture may prevent the electric ignition from working properly. If you hear clicking when the burner is supposed to be off, make sure the knob is turned all the way to off, and that the knob has popped out.    Range burners are round and have small holes evenly placed around their perimeter. These holes allow gas to flow out and create a controlled flame when lit. Sometimes the gas orifices get plugged and the gas cant get through to be ignited. The trick is to clean them without making the holes any bigger. You need to clean the burners thoroughly. Many people use a toothpick, old toothbrush, or a small pin to clear the holes, allowing the gas to flow freely. If, after cleaning the burners, they still don't light, you should call a professional appliance repair person.    Sometimes ranges have different size burners on them. If you have recently cleaned the burners, it is possible you put a small burner cap on the large burner, or vice versa. Double check to make sure this isn't the problem, and make sure they are seated properly.

My friend has a Tarm (wood burning boiler outside) to heat his home. When the Tarm is heating the electric isn't. Do not get a heat pump if you get temps below 40 for the winter. I strongly recommend propane hot water heat. Geothermal heat would be the cheapest if you want a heat pump. It is not effected by the outside temp so no electric heating is needed for temps below 40F. All it is is pipes buried in the yard below the frost line. Air is pumped through the pipe and warmed. It then blows over the heat pump coil to heat the house. This is the only way I would get a heat pump|`|YrAa4jl2aa	Ditto Jayktee9.|`|817470a87caf9f7b1221582f25eb9084aa	Storage heaters are inefficient and confusing for some people.

In un altro caso mi e' arrivata la lettera del sindaco che mi dava il benvenuto (forse grato del fatto che una persona in piu' gli pagasse le tasse :D ) e nell'ultima citta' in cui sono venuta a vivere nessuno mi ha avvisato di nulla e quando dopo qualche mese sono andata a chiedere lumi all'anagrafe, mi hanno detto che ero residente da un mesetto buono e nessuno mi aveva in nessun modo informata.  Quindi, una volta fatta la domanda, ti consiglio di fare controlli periodici presso l'anagrafe del tuo comune visto che a quanto pare ognuno ha le sue regole non scritte.

ac31f94f0db5bac5d823016e04d15cf7aa	Most orchids will do best in a filtered light environment, such as under a tree with a high canopy.  That will allow it to get lots of bright, indirect light.  As far as a ficus, it can tolerate full sun as long as it has been acclimated to it a little at a time.  If you put a ficus outside in full sun from a sheltered, indoor place, it may get very angry at you and drop all it's leaves at once.  (It may do that anyway, even if you don't.

Ciao,|`|d1bbab5a5b20d642e7dfa98fd5c1eca8aa	un po' morta come camera da letto...io avrei optato per delle pareti color pesca,ma visto ke nn mi sembra ke tu sia intenzionata a cambiare colore allora devi esagerare sulla biankeria.arancione,blu,verde acceso....oltre al copripiumino ke magari lo puoi prendere monocromatico aggiungi dei cuscini ke contrastino parekkio...almeno metti 1 po' di allegria!!!|`|a46826c991ceea53ae2416084f1e03c7aa	ma scusa....e lo domandi ancoraa???   muri color caffelatte.....   mobili colore brioches....ma mi sembra ovvio noo??....|`|4fa3eab8a5b750a812b55472b5d8d25daa	Che dilemma...

Io sceglierei un verde pistacchio perch con un beige/panna e con il nero delle stampe ci starebbe davvero bene  Magari anche un lume colorato pu aggiungere un p di vivacit.  Poi, dipende da quanto tu e tuo marito siete disposti a osare in fatto di arredamento...|`|c029bd17c97dbc4c2ed343b26bd3643daa	Io l'ho dipinta di un giallo ocra vivace ho messo delle tendoni svolazzanti e leggeri color verde pisello e i border intorno intonati, davvero bellissima e luminosa.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	da quello che capisco dalla tua domanda non vuoi cambiare colore alle pareti o sbaglio? peccato, x' un bel verde salvia (molto rilassante) avrebbe dato una nota di colore senza esagerare. x la biancheria ribadisco quello che ti hanno gi detto in tanti buttati sull'arancione/ocra e magari anche verde in varie tonalit. x le decorazioni alle pareti, beh abbinare qualcosa alle stampe in bianco e nero non  facile, dipende dallo stile dei tuoi mobili, cmq cos d'istinto mi viene da dirti quadri a tempera astratti molto molto colorati e senza cornice.  attendiamo sviluppi, mi raccomando!!!|`|4cc2c6c4e21ab8c9c81b720be5c81d59aa	Ti rispondo per gusto personale e non sulla base di una specifica esperienza tecnica:il bianco  perfetto e non guasta mai,illumina e allarga l'ambiente(proprio a livello di effetto ottico).  Se per vuoi personalizzare,devi usare una tappezzeria.  A questo punto,ti consiglierei di esagerare:  non carta da parati ma una tappezzeria di colore beige "tipo stoffa"(non so se per caso ti  mai capitato di vederla e toccarla).Quella tappezzeria che appunto sembra quasi una stoffa e passandoci la mano ti da quella sensazione di vellutino(il beige va benissimo e rimarrai stupefatta nel vedere la "trasformazione" ottica del colore che tu stessa hai scelto cambiando il materiale,cio non pi pittura ma tappezzeria vellutata):alle pareti io applicherei questa e per terra una calda moquette(anche qui ti consiglio di spendere e sceglierne una "alta" non sottile,se mi capisci quello che voglio dire).Auguri.|`|79a20929072578ae3d052b49e3c4e5e6aa	io ci abbinerei qualcosa color albicocca o arancio..... un colore ke mi piace e secondo me darebbe un tocco di vita alla tua stanza beige|`|845f47528e17fa95a0ac27d121f1bb09aa	per il copriletto o lenzuola metterei un pesca molto chiaro giusto x dar un podi calore e cosi smorzare un polambiente freddo che si ecreato! poi a te la scelta.....|`|6ef239038e5505be940c149d881d4d0caa	biancheria sul rosa azzurro...tende o tendoni bianchi con fantasie floreali...preferibilmente in pizzo...|`|ec1919e887dd77e46f86ed5fe92702a6aa	giocca sui contrasti, e' sbagliato fare tutto dello stesso colore secondo me.

AA10276729	I just did this about 2 weeks ago actually. Use a scoring tool all over the wall first. Then either use a wallpaper removing solution, that can be bought at walmart or a home improvement store, or a mixture of water and fabric softener. Then use a spatula, putty knife, or a scraper made specially for that to scrape the paper off of the walls. The special scraper makes the job easier too, and I think is worth the few dollars it cost. The glued parts are the hardest to get off and are stubborn. But at least your room will smell good if you use fabric softener. Oh and clean the wall really good before you paint. Good luck. Be prepared to give your arms a workout. And have a step stool/ladder handy.|`|394cf9d0d9ba4ec92387bd080953d1cbaa	tear the paper part off the wall by hand then use wall paper remover solution for the glue on the walls and good luck that is not a fun job at all!

f4b705ac0fb7c3af1af77b6f645d30c4aa	You are not going to be able to fix this one yourself.  If the freezer is working properly and there is no frost in the freezer than it would most likely be the fan that blows the cool air from the freezer to the refrigerator.  It is probably a $120 repair.  In the future don't buy Frigidaire it is by far the appliance that has the most repair problems of any of the major manufacturers.      Good Luck!|`|108731ba5da16493eb9b837e78af4680aa	have you checked the temperature setting inside the fridge, maybe one of your kids turned it off, if your motor is running and the freezer is cold, it means your fridge is working|`|6077199a037f36a08eec6469a92e0f9aaa	check the fan in the freezer   theere should be a fan which blows the cold air from the freezer to the frige  usually they will get a lil ice on them and get froze in place  (use a hair dryer but be careful to not be water on it)|`|426bc1886611b29ecc4e953ac94a3a9faa	Check the temp setting, it might be turned down. Then check to see if you have air blowing inside the fridge. It should be coming in from the back or bottom. After that I am lost, but I have been to a website that has a lot of great info for repairing appliances. It is www.samurairepairman.com . Good luck|`|82aa3add9e2d1fb443f1ee53e3de5226aa	I'm a HVAC tech . Sometimes when the freezer fails to defrost the freezer evap coil gets covered with ice you may have to open the back in the freezer compartment and check to see if the coil is covered with ice or frozen completely up. Try using a blow dryer to melt all the ice off the coil. This should remedy the problem. If not you can check the defrost timers and the evap fan motor to make sure it is running. Also there may be ice frozen in the dampers not allowing the cool air to pass down to the fresh food compartment.. Hope this helps post more info if this doesn't work..|`|5aa7239bb99edcd268a5c1fb15a9300aaa	One person said check the evaporator fan...thats in the freezer, if its working, its ok.     Another said something long and not for a lay person to understand from reading here. If the back of your freezer (side by side) or the bottom (top and bottom) are frosted with ice, you have a defrotst problem.      You wont be able to fix it yourself unless you know how. The remidy suggested to use a hair dryer is fruitless. You need to dismantel the  back wall of the freezer, or the floor of a top and bottom, and THEN defrost it.     Defrosting it only buys you time, your problem may be a stuck defrost timer which is stuck in the RUN mode instead of the "Defrost" mode.  I highly suggest that if you find icing in your fridge, to get a professional to do this work for you.     Good luck
AA11301271	First thing, washing soda is not the same thing as borax - check out the Wikipedia articles below.    I have been searching for washing soda too, and in the grocery store that's what it's called because it's a great all-purpose cleaner and detergent booster. You'll probably be able to find Arm and Hammer Super Washing Soda in the detergent aisle of the grocery store. Washing soda is chemically sodium carbonate, not to be confused with baking soda, which is sodium bicarbonate (but they are related). Sodium carbonate is much harsher and must be handled with gloves.    If you can't find it there (my local store doesn't carry it) see if you can find another product that is 100% sodium carbonate. S.C. is also used to lower the pH of pools and spas and can be found under various labels in pool supply stores, generally called an "adjuster" or "pH down" or whatnot. (Make sure whatever product you get is 100% sodium bicarbonate!) It's also called soda ash sometimes.    Amazon carries Arm and Hammer washing soda (which you can buy along with borax for a discount and make your own laundry detergent!): http://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Super-W...|`|9a564ec1244bb95329af73de71d3c82aaa	It is some times known as Borax, It is available in some hardware stores and most supermarkets in Aus|`|ecfb919e1e7ab8d6023f9575861f5c71aa	Not sure why you ask but soda in wash is an urban ledgend.

Those are chemical solutions and hydrocarbons, respectively.

If you're touching the wire and are not grounded to anything, you probably won't get shocked either.  It sounds like to me that you have the neutral and the ground wire crossed.  Even though the outlet will still work, this is dangerous and needs to be fixed.
