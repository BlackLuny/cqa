If you are confident in your computer skills, I would suggest removing one stick of RAM at a time and booting your computer.  If it still blue screens, replace the removed stick and remove another, and so on.<br>  <br>  If the process turns up nothing, it is possible (tho unlikely) that you may have more than one bad stick of RAM.  There are many memory testers out there, but if the system crashes randomly, it will be difficult to run the mem tester.  An easy option would be to download an Ubuntu Linux Live CD from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download</a> .  Boot your computer from the Live CD instead of booting into Windows and select the last option in the CD's boot menu.  This will load MemTest86+ instead of booting directly into Ubuntu.  After at least one full pass, you should be able to either confirm that you do have some bad memory or rule it out all together.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ZPAxu7Cxaa	It sounds like the RAM to me, pop that pc open and first check to see if all of the RAM is identical, then check each stick individually put one in to see if it blue screens and then move on to the other|`|AA12336620	Check the RAM

076i35yGaa	Jesse, your answer is correct except that the traffic will need to have a return path as well, not just default routes as there will be a network on the second router that the first router will not know about.  If the routers support RIP you can turn that on and that will work.  If the routers support static routes you can tell the first router what network you have and to send it to that router.  If the routers do not support either of these you can see if one can be put into bridging mode.  If it can't do that you are out of luck, get a switch or AP.|`|vULSEVq6aa	you can use two wireless routers, but if you dont know how to configure them to work together, it will be very difficult. you need two routers, 1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 , and the other router will *have* to have a different subnet mask, what ever subnet mask works with your LAN. 255.255.252.0 //along those lines. Both default gateways have to be different *if* different routers because they will be the IP of the router. your best bet is to use 1 wireless router, 1 usb device, and have your wireless on your desktop, and wireless / hard wired xbox connections.

Biggest single upgrade in terms of immediate impact.  You won't be able to use the better midrange cards because your factory power supply can't handle them.  But something like a Radeon 3650 or GeForce 9400GT would work.<br>  <br>  The big question is whether your computer is a regular tower or small form factor? The Optiplex GX270 came in both versions.  If it's a slimline, you'll only be able to use half-height video cards.<br>  <br>  Right now, the FX5200 is a bigger handicap than the 1gb of system RAM.|`|AA11647242	keep in mind that games 80% of preformance come from its video card, or aka gpu and gpu ram, so i would probally change the video card, to maybe a 512, or 1gb, also keep in mind that your power supply may not be cable for this upgrade, most dell psu's are 250w to 350w, most newer cards want at least 450w psu's. Also RAM is at its lowest price ever, you can throw another 1gb chip for around $19.95 at newegg.com|`|1us4yPv4aa	Well, I would recommend to buy new one... but anyways...

If you want your computer to aork faster...|`|13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	like another said, one of the biggest bang-for-buck upgrades is a new video card.  However, I am assuming that you are using an agp card...since the fx5 series is ancient.  If that is the case, then you might have a tougher time finding a "decent" new card and maybe a better chance of finding a used one somewhere....look for nvidia 6800 or ati x1900 or x800.  These are old..but they will work with that system.  Other than that, get 2x 1gb ram to replace what you have.|`|Jf9aKluvaa	Upgrade Ram. what operating system r u using? if your MB supports it upgrade to 4gb. Reason is that a decent laptop comes with 2..  if you want it to keep up long term...   i am not familiar with graph cards though. Your processor seems fine, as its wayyyy better then mine.  If its Xp 1gb will run well. considering im just slipping by on 256 mb... Its a school issue comp, i dont wanna spend money on it...  Upgrade graphics card to. google the requirements to play spore. See if your graph card can handle it. but those are the 2 biggies. Ram is very cheap, so i would do both.

Gw97sxGhaa	Here is my advice:<br>  <br>  Step one: Run the clean print cartridges utility<br>  <br>     1.<br>        Press the Setup button.<br>     2.<br>        Press the down arrow key.<br>     3.<br>        Select Clean Print Cartridge and then press OK . The device prints a test page.<br>     4.<br>        Examine the test page. If the print quality of the page is good, stop here. If the print quality is bad, go on to the next step for further cleaning.<br>     5.<br>        Open the Printer Toolbox . There are two ways to do this:<br>            *<br>              Open HP Solution Center , select the Settings menu, then the Print Settings submenu, and finally the Printer Toolbox .<br>            *<br>              Open Printers and Faxes in the Windows Control Panel , then right-click your printer icon and choose Properties . Click Printing Preferences . Click the Features tab, then click the Printer Services button.<br>     6.<br>        The Printer Toolbox opens. On the Device Services tab, click Clean the Print Cartridges , then follow the on-screen instructions. Up to three levels of cleaning are available. Discard or recycle the page that prints.<br>  <br>  Step two: Replace the problem cartridge (you probably have a defective cartridge)<br>  If a cartridge replacement was not tried previously to solve this problem, replace the problem cartridge now<br>  <br>  Cause and prevention<br>  Color mix is usually caused by a material touching the nozzles. Ink can wick along the material and travel from nozzle to nozzle. When different colors of ink mix in this way, the result is muddy, inaccurate colors.<br>  Missing colors occur when the cartridge nozzles dry out, or when a color is exhausted because of specific printing demands.<br>  <br>      *<br>        Do not remove the protective tape from a new print cartridge until just before you install it. Once you remove the tape, do not reapply it.<br>      *<br>        After you have removed the protective tape, do not allow anything to touch the nozzles.<br>      *<br>        Print at least once a month to keep the print cartridges in good working order.<br>      *<br>        Always turn the printer off by pressing the button on the printer control panel, rather than by unplugging the printer. Turning the printer off properly allows it to protect the cartridges.<br>      *<br>        If you are removing a cartridge from the printer temporarily (for instance, removing the black cartridge in order to install the photo cartridge), put it in a cartridge protector.<br>      *<br>        If you do not have a cartridge protector and need to remove a cartridge temporarily, put it in an airtight plastic tub. Make sure nothing touches the nozzles. Do not use a plastic bag. If you intend to store print cartridges in a tub for a long period of time, place color cartridges with the nozzles down, and black cartridges with the nozzles up.

AA10078383	Hi  there,<br>  <br>  <br>  Its recommended that you charge a new battery upto 100% on the first use. In case if you don't do that the battery might get in kinda of standby mode. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For starters, you can try doing a power drain. Remove the battery and disconnect all the external cables including the power cable. Then press and hold down the Power button of your laptop, keep on holding the power button for about 20-30 secs and then put back the battery and the ac adapter and check if its working. I'm not sure what was the exact problem with your battery. The two common issues are that it will never accept the charge (in that case it could be an adapter issue too) or it would charge fully but it will drain out in less than half hour. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One other step you can try to charge with battery with the computer powered off. Shut down the system and make sure ac adapter is connected and check if its charging. In case if the battery had indeed the standby then it would take the charge if you try by this method. Even in this method it would take 2-3 hours for the battery to get fully charged. Another option is to do a BIOS update for the system. in order to flash the BIOS you need to have more than 10% charge on the battery. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Try out these basic steps and then tell me what happens.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>   <br>  Jayarajaganesh.<br>  Dell Tech Support|`|sYxUVBvPaa	Well either you killed it right away by doing that or it will be ok after the first 12 hours.

However all your files will be deleted and you will have a fresh computer as if youve just bought it. So i suggest you put all your files onto discs/pen drives etc.<br>  <br>  Or you can create recovery discs, that will format your hard drive (clean it out), and it will be the same case as the system restore, so backup your files onto removable devices.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|0S344Tefaa	Just try to scan the infected folder or scan the entire computer so that the whole and other infected folder will be scan.

If your processor is not dual core then you really need one because the graphics card can use the second part of the cpu. I upgraded my whole system to an nvidia 8500 GT and a dual core 2.6GHz processor. <br>  <br>  You can just upgrade the graphics card but make sure to get the right one for your system (AGP or PCI-E)|`|dkpIjt5jaa	EDIT: Since you told us it is actually a desktop, if you upgrade to NVIDIA 7900 or newer, you have to check a few things.<br>  <br>  1) The type of connector in your computer for cards ( PCI, PCIe or AGP).<br>  <br>  2) The power your PSU (Power Supply Unit) must give for the card to work.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic card), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+30+25 = 524<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I have no idea of your system.<br>  <br>  So compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 600 Watts and get up to 700 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>

WRcbYyroaa	By setting everything in your Profile (under Security Settings), to the level of 'Friends', you have already limited your Profile to just your Friends. Don't worry, they will only see your name in their Friends' friend lists, but they won't be able to access your Profile unless they are a Friend of yours.<br>  <br>  Also be sure to set your Photo Albums to 'Friends', and group all unsorted pictures (such as those from Wall posts), into various new or existing Albums, and double check the Security level on those to make sure they're set to 'Friends' because sometimes a glitch can temporary allow them access to your Photo(s) that are unsorted (IE: Wall posted photos).<br>  <br>  You can also remove yourself from the Search, by clicking 'Search' after you're in Security Settings.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|O1NOuJ5Caa	Usually when you set your privacy settings to only friends, it pertains to the things your friend's could see like, notes, photos tagged of you etc. They can still search and see you as long as you didn't change your privacy settings for searching the facebook data base.
cLUwf3rraa	It could be because you went over your monthly bandwidth limit. You should call and ask your ISP if you have a certain bandwidth limit. When I first signed up with my ISP they claimed to be "Unlimited" until I recently found out they actually had a 500GB monthly limit. Of course, I never get close to using up the 500GB a month, so I guess it is kind of unlimited in a sense. I don't think they will be charging you just because you download files. While you are just looking at web pages you are downloading data as well.

d3ad8545c7b9175df8ca7dc65b5c8eccaa	I would at least get a computer with a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo or AMD Dual Core processor, you could opt for a Intel Quad Core Q6600 @ 2.4 GHz which is much more expensive but provides more processing power. 4 GB of RAM which would require Windows XP or Vista 64-Bit, which would then require a video card like a Geforce 8600, or Geforce 8800, or a ATI Radeon 2600 or 3400. So you should look for a 2.4 GHz processor, Windows Vista 64-Bit with 4 GB of RAM, and a dedicated Nvidia or ATI video card, rather than a Intel GMA. That is basically a pretty good machine for surfing without slow downs, and for doing a lot of processes at the same time.<br>  Have a nice day<br>  Ken|`|7TqFISbtaa	The more memory the better ie 4GB Ram|`|ZPAxu7Cxaa	I recommend a pc with a dual core cpu not to heavy graphics card such as geforce 7 series about 2gb of RAM and maybe a 160 or 320 gb hard drive

Maybe it was that type at one point and has outlived its usefulness in less than a year. By solid I mean I had to take the heatsink off and use a screwdriver as a chisel with both arms to get it off...<br>  <br>  Apparently the thermal grease they use is bottom of the barrel.

( I have done this with a Toshiba I repaired and it works better now ).<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is to slightly prop the rear of the laptop for better ventilation.<br>  <br>  Some people may tell you to buy a USB "cooling" pad, well if you do purchase one, make sure to get one with its own power supply – or – connect it through a hub that also has its own power supply.<br>  <br>  The reason for that is that the ones powered by the laptop's internal USB connectors will draw more power from the PC causing it to heat more than it already does (not helpful at all).<br>  <br>  <br>  For lots more information on your machine, you can check these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins1521/en/om_en/html/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/sy...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/vos1500/en/sm/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/sy...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|YTHmYqllaa	you answered your own question 4 words into it.

793oKjC5aa	You've picked a file with no seeds or peers so the likelyhood it is not going to download until somebody uploads it that is why it is downloading a small bit then not because not many people have it up for downloading. When picking a torrent you should always pick one with a good seed to peer ratio. A torrent with say 2800 seeds and say 1000 leechers should download quicker than a torrent with say 4500 seeds and 7000 leechers. Your speed of downloading will also depend on other peoples download speeds if  your are downloading from someone that has a download speed of 20kb/s then thats the speed you will get also. There are many different factors that affect download speed that is just one of them|`|D9zB8suoaa	Usually you can't view your files when in use from another program. If it's not downloading, its probably because simply there is no seeds or leaches to download or upload from. You might not have been able to see your file because someone was downloading it, or you viewed it when Bit Torrent was off. If the file stalls like that, you usually just have to be patient, the source lists refreshes every once in a while. (I use Ares and my sources refresh every 15 minutes.) Your file couldn't of been working also if you restarted your computer at that time, because sometimes Bit Torrent loses track of your file progress when completed after you restart, so you still have the file within your computer, but it's not able to be viewed through the Bit Torrent shortcut to the folder. Sorry if that's a bit lengthy... XD

dec53da7ace2edfec70ed4fcba15cd43aa	well here are a few difference Linux is much more secure because its open source and has less virus because less script kiddy's use Linux.<br>  linux can run on a usb,cd or DVD with out having to install it so you can have windows on your computer and use Linux. Windows has more games.thou linux runs the internet and video game servers. <br>  <br>  That is a question that has many different answers, depending on what aspect of Windows or Linux you want to know about. Both are what are known as Operating Systems, and in this case, both are designed to work on the same type of hardware -- PCs, otherwise known as IBM Compatibles. There are enormous differences in the way that they behave at a technical level, but I suspect what you really want to know is how they differ from the perspective of an end user. This makes any answer I give somewhat subjective (users have different preferences and expectations of their computers), but I will do my best to give an answer that is generally accepted by the IT community.<br>  <br>  Windows was introduced by Microsoft in 1983, and has been the dominant Operating System available for the PC since the early-nineties. As such, Microsoft has enjoyed great financial success, and Windows has had many years and incredible fiscal resources to evolve to meet the demands of the mass-market. There is an staggeringly rich set of features here, from very explicit, step-by-step user interfaces for the first time computer user, to powerful interfaces for the computer professional, and everything in between. By contrast, Linux achieved notoriety a bit later, in the mid-nineties, with a distribution known as Redhat, and although Linux was built on more mature, stable underpinnings (Unix), it did not enjoy nearly the same marketing or development budget that Microsoft threw behind Windows. In fact, the developers of Linux are commonly credited as founding the Open Source Software movement, which is the idea that software can be made better through the free sharing of its source code. In this philosophy, programmers often volunteer their time to develop software for free, as was done with Linux, and Linux is still available for free in its more basic forms. Companies like Redhat only make money by "packaging" Linux with printed documentation, extra software utilities, and setup wizards designed to make the installation of Linux and its subsequent software packages easier. Even so, the amount of money they are able to generate this way is paltry compared to the wealth of Microsoft (which makes most company's financials look paltry). Because of this, the marketing behind Linux has been miniscule compared to that of Windows, and its lack of acceptance among less technical users reflects this. A large reason is because Windows has established a very deeply-ingrained (and some have argued unfairly controlling) relationship with PC hardware manufacturers, ensuring that almost every new PC ships with Windows installed from day one. Given that they must satisfy the demands (though perhaps less than perfectly) of the majority of novice computer users, and add to that the amount of time and money that Windows has enjoyed to make itself accessible to these users, and it is easy to see why Windows is generally regarded as superior to Linux in the area of accessibility to novices. There are graphic user interfaces (abbreviated as GUI) present for almost everything you could want to do, and there is almost always more than one way to do it. In fact, one common criticism of Windows is that so many features have been layered on top of one another over the years, that it has become an overly-complicated, almost labyrinthine user experience. By contrast, some may find Linux to be more streamlined; however, there are still many equivalent features in Windows for which Linux does not provide a GUI, and the user is forced to type textual instructions into a command-line interface, or shell. While many power users consider this a plus, it is unrealistic to demand this of novice computer users, and novice users should bear this strongly in mind. All this being said, Linux still shines brilliantly in some areas that Windows seems to consistently flounder. Because the underlying architecture of Linux is more mature, stable, and secure than Windows, Linux "crashes" and "freezes" significantly less often, and can run continuously without problems for months or even years without being "rebooted". In addition, Linux does not suffer from the same security flaws as Windows, and your chances of contracting a virus, a worm, or some other form of predatory software is much lower. On an more subjective note, I suspect that given the same time and monetary advantages as Windows, Linux might have easily developed into a superior operating system in every regard.<br>  <br>  As it stands today, they each have pros and cons. Windows is widely accepted everywhere, boasts an enormous plethora of GUIs, and has millions of software packages that run under it.|`|BPTgXfl7aa	Linux isn't an operating system, but the operating system is Linux-based.<br>  <br>  The Linux OSes they have on mini laptops are designed to be fast and easy to use.

Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4.

VWBXCQrIaa	The Epson printers have a reservoir in the rear where they drain ink from the cleaning cycles. Each cleaning is counted until the assumption is made that the reservoir is full.

Just download the virutal machine from microsoft, after you download it there is a wizard that will take you through the steps of creating a virtual disk.  Once your done creating a virtual disk put in your server 2003 disk and your virtual machine will take off starting to install server 2003<br>  <br>  If you need additional help feel free to email me<br>  cardinalsfan030@yahoo.com|`|AA11845254	I do not know Mike.But its nice to see you again.Where ya been?<br>  I always meant to tell you I don't like the "cool dude" picture you have.I loved the fat naked guy and I miss him...but nah...don't like the dude:)Have a happy day :)<br>  Suzie

Syvig9Q9aa	your question is so vague that I can only suggest a system reinstall AND failing that: purchasing a new computer. Also, if I knew you. I'd lend you my computer. Maybe reinstall the software for your mic if there was any. If it is not a USB mic, maybe a USB mic will work (asin the mic port maybe damaged).|`|Mp9Q9An4aa	If you hear sounds but it's not recording them, I'd guess that you're looking at the playback volume controls. If that is the case, select properties from the volume control file menu, switch to recording & check the levels there.|`|PgiqUtCraa	Go into your volume/playback control or mixer(whichever you have), and turn all of them on, especially mic & wave. Also, if you have a sound card, make sure you're plugged into mic & not line-in. On your playback controls, make sure nothing is muted, especially wave & volume(master volume or whatever it is called on your computer). If that doesn't work, you might try removing sound card & use built in audio controls. If, for some reason you can't find these things, look in sound recorder\edit\audio properties & make sure everything matches what you're using there.
2SSA9e9Naa	Well, first they want more sales. Vista uptake was very low so there wasn't much money made.<br>  <br>  Second, there have been a lot of improvements after XP, especially when you look at Windows 7. There are a lot of features that make it more supportable  for the end user (some of the auto-fix technology is good. It's auto-uninstall in case an upgrade fails is really cool).<br>  <br>  Third, they don't want to have to support 3 operating systems, especially when the later one has a lot of fixes.<br>  <br>  As far as requirements our testing shows that W7 is much better on resources (even in beta form) than Vista.|`|sYxUVBvPaa	i have a lengthy answer for you. First off "looks" has nothing to do with how your computer runs so weather people like xp or vistas look better it does not matter. It is the next generation of computer OS technology and its something people will have to accept and get used to. Vista looks awesome BTW so there should not be an issue there. I have only ever met a handful of people who did not like the way Vista operates and looks over XP. Second it will be available ( or is supposed to be) in early or mid 2010 as a first release but by the time it starts comming standard on computers it will be at the end of 2010 or early 2011. The requirements are WAY lower. It only requires 1GB of RAM and will support a processor as slow as 1.0MHZ

dkpIjt5jaa	Using a consumer-level laptop for gaming brings this problem a lot !<br>  <br>  Your computer can be adjusted with power plans ( Page 4 of <a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01487101.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01...</a> ) to help you conserve power or maximize performance. You can create your own power plan.<br>  <br>  Viewing the current power plan : Move the pointer over the battery meter icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar – or – Select Start > Control Panel > System and Maintenance > Power Options.<br>  <br>  If possible (that depends a lot on manufacturer), you should try making a customized plan in which you lower the CPU frequency a little bit and maximize the way the fans turn. ( I have done this with a Toshiba I repaired and it works better now ).<br>  <br>  Customizing power plans: 1. Click the battery meter icon in the notification area and then click More power options – or – Select Start > Control Panel > System and Maintenance > Power Options.<br>  <br>  2. Select a power plan, and then click Change plan settings.<br>  <br>  3. Change the Turn off the display and Put the computer to sleep timeout settings, as needed.<br>  <br>  4.

RzakCYHFaa	Well sir, the program itself doesn't, (if you get it from a legit source, such as its main website and not brothersof) but limewire uses Peer-to-Peer file sharing network, so anybody can put whatever they want on there, with whatever name they want, so you may think your getting that certain song you want, but your instead getting a virus..  the program itself doesn't, but what you download CAN, it won't always be a virus, but they can be.  So the simple answer to your question is no.  Limewire itself does not give you viruses.|`|caTPi1e0aa	No limewire will not give off a virus if you use it unless you downloaded it from a site that gives off viruses when you download the file. but when you use limewire to download files those files may have viruses so make sure you have a firewall and AV ready for protection.<br>  <br>  so use limewire and similar software at your own risk|`|u7joFVQcaa	the program itself doesnt contain any viruses but the files you download from limewire may contain one|`|AE3lv4pRaa	If you are going to use Limewire, do NOT keep it on 24/7. Only have it running a download while you are at your system, and keep an eye out on your shared folder. If you see files you KNOW you didnt download, delete them, and scan for viruses|`|o96Z8gUsaa	Simply: YES.<br>  <br>  //we are human beings and tend to corrupt anything we can. <br>  <br>  Limwire does not 'give off' viruses by default.<br>  <br>  To get a virus you would have to download an infected file placed on the network by a malicious/unknowing user.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  By installing a pirated limewire program that is usually edited for by some unscrupulous individual.

That is the processor I have and it runs extremely well with mid-mid-low graphics. Although my processor is centrino inside, which is one step above. This will be fine though, especially with XP. You will only have trouble with extremely graphical games, which I haven't really run into. In answer, that is a good laptop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|7oLxSETOaa	yea not bad.... you can run every game you want, but not all of them on ultra high graphics, if u can buy a laptop a little better than this it would be better for u if you want High graphics on gaming.

t5sYXwSqaa	This is typical of a heating problem. Sound like the main fan has had dust in its bearing and as it has been left on has gradually got hotter. This has affected the glue that attaches it to the CPU. You will need to buy another fan and special glue. (The old fan might be okay but you will need to put a couple of drops of oil in the bearing and run it) personally I would purchase another fan and attach it using the glue and clips (if they are there). You will then need to see if this corrects the problem. If not you may need to post again or give further details.|`|gHf4ryUqaa	that fan is your CPU fan, normally they have clips that will keep them attached to the cpu, it you have another computer available do a search on the internet that will show you how to clip it back on.<br>  the fun has to be on the cpu to keep it from overheating.<br>  Unfortunately now days the fans come and different shapes and the way to attach them to the CPU varies from fan to fan so I wouldn't be able to tell you how to do it without knowing what you have.|`|AA12364602	the fan you see dangling may be the CPU fan, and if the CPU isn't keeping cool, your computer will shut down automatically due to a safety precaution. until you get that fan put back properly, i wouldn't try to turn your computer back on.

hdTJ5Lpnaa	All ways move it to quarantine.<br>  m|`|DEHN1qmraa	What does being Quarantined mean?<br>  <br>  Quarantining rooms is a method that Housing and the University use to prevent damage to our networks. Quarantines are done on a room-to-room basis. If you are quarantined, it is likely that either your computer, or your roommate's, has a virus or spyware. Neither you nor your roommate(s) will be able to access any online resources except Housing's quarantine network help pages. Your room will remain quarantined until the infected machine has been cleaned and a NetTech has verified this.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Reasons for being Quarantined<br>  <br>  Typically, a room will be quarantined if either Housing or CITES detects a virus on one of the computers connected in the room. We may also quarantine machines that have not been updated. The quarantine network help pages contain instructions and files to clean and protect your computer. By placing infected machines on a separate network, we reduce the number of campus machines that will become infected, and keep the traffic on the normal network running smoothly. By using the quarantine network, we hope to reduce the number of disconnections from previous years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How do I prevent my computer from getting Quarantined?<br>  <br>  To prevent your computer from being placed on the Quarantine network you should install a virus scanner and make sure the virus definitions are not out of date. Also, it is wise to install and use a spyware scanner on a monthly basis. Make sure to update your Operating System when prompted by Microsoft, Apple, or Linux, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What to do if you are Quarantined<br>  <br>  Instructions for how to resolve quarantines are available on the quarantine network help pages. To preview the quarantine page click here. Open a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) and follow the instructions listed there. If the quarantine pages do not appear try typing in a website such as www.google.com and see if the pages then appear. Once you have completed the instructions, contact a NetTech to be taken out of the quarantine.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How will I know I was Quarantined?<br>  <br>  When you have been quarantined, you will not be able to access any other internet websites besides the "Quarantine Pages." You will not be able to use AIM or other internet applications. When you open up your internet browser the first quarantine page you will see looks like this. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.housing.uiuc.edu/technology/URHnetsecurity/Policies/Quarantine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.housing.uiuc.edu/technology/U...</a>|`|7j9Hj02caa	Its basically like locking the virus off from the rest of your computer while it is still on your computer. Kinda like if someone is really sick and (and contagious) they are put alone and locked away from everyone else so they don't spread the disease, infection or virus to anyone else. But it is better to just get rid of the virus in general. Then you know that it is no-where on your computer. Also for free virus protector, even if you already have another one, its good to run that one and to download Windows Defender which can be downloded at microsoft.com for free.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And yes that was a VERY smart move|`|IHlAgBiNaa	it is like put the virus in prison when the virus do something wrong then the anti virus will delete it automaticly and the virus will not do something bad to your computer

They look like scams.<br>  Just my suggestion,|`|fXvOEZ8Yaa	TOS = Terms Of Service<br>  As for the ads colors and placement: Google says you should make it blend in, and you do that very well. However, I would loose the skyscraper on the right. It is a bit overkill, and way too flashy. It just screams Made For Adsense...<br>  In general, your placement of one large square in the middle, and a banner in the footer is ok, but I would try to get a little more content inbetween, and if you have an article that is too short, dump the adsense in the middle. People do not  like adsense pages...<br>  And watch out with pages like these:<br>  <a href="http://www.bsbcenter.com/MoneyEmp/Accounting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bsbcenter.com/MoneyEmp/Accoun...</a><br>  Google doesn't like to see its adsense on an empty page.<br>  More adsense finetuning info? <a href="http://www.icantinternet.org/category/adsense/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icantinternet.org/category/ad...</a>

The paid verstion is just a scam to trick you into thinking you are downloading legaly. When in fact your not. You still can get infected and you still are commiting a crime.|`|2vUOqAikaa	Hmm, well technically limewire itself is not illegal. "Depending" on what you download off of it is the illegal part.|`|DEHN1qmraa	Please dismiss the "if you buy PRO then it is LEGAL".<br>  <br>   LimeWire: Legal or Illegal<br>  <br>  LimeWire and other file-sharing software are legal. Using it to upload or download copyright protected media -- music, videos, images, software -- without the copyright holder's consent is illegal because it is theft.<br>  <br>  Here are more opinions and tips:<br>  <br>      * LimeWire says it is legal because technically it's just a "file sharing" service and it is not held responsible for the files that are downloaded onto the system. Only the users are responsible. That's why, when you download songs from LimeWire, it's legal for them, but NOT for you. <br>  <br>      * Don't be fooled by the fee you pay to use the PRO version of LimeWire. The artists of the songs you download don't get a penny of that! ("LimeWire offers two versions of the software: LimeWire Basic which is free of charge; the other is LimeWire PRO which costs a small fee, features faster download speeds and better search results, including up to 6 months of free updates and customer support via email.") <br>  <br>      * Even if you download a coyrighted song for your own personal use, it's still illegal. Perhaps one could skate around the issue if they already own a legal copy on a CD, but then why download it if that's the case. Any fees paid to LimeWire are for purchasing the software and that's it. <br>  <br>      * LimeWire is not illegal software. All it is is file sharing. However, many people abuse this by sharing songs without the copyright. For example, if you have produced a song and then share it on LimeWire, anyone else can legally have it for free. But when you haven't made it, but an artist has, who has copyright on that song (which they all do) downloading that song without permission from the producer is totally illegal. <br>  <br>      * Downloading songs and other copyrighted material is illegal, but if you wanted to share a music file of you singing or playing an instrument, then that is perfectly legal. <br>  <br>      * LIMEWIRE IS ILLEGAL! Although, with LimeWire, you will probably never get caught, if you as much as bring your computer in for a repair and a worker sees the program or any music you downloaded from LimeWire, he is ordered BY LAW to tell his boss, and you will get a fine (I had to pay approximately $200.) It's not pretty. Although we all want LimeWire to be legal, it isn't. <br>  <br>      * The LimeWire software itself is not illegal -- that is why the site is still up and why you can still download it. However, if you download a song from the program and you do not pay copyright on it, that is illegal. Songs from the 1950's (or before that date) are legal to download because their copyright has expired. Anything from after that is illegal to download. However... You are all going to do it anyway, so this is just to make you aware of the legal situation! <br>  <br>      * Is LimeWire illegal? No, it is not. It CAN'T legally be held accountable for what its users do. Let's put it like this: A major virus takes out the whole of the Internet. But when they trace the source, it leads to Runescape servers, for example. Runescape is an online game that gives its users access to its servers, kind of like LimeWire. Now are the people who own Runescape responsible? Nope, but its users ARE. Same thing with LimeWire. My advice to you is this: Do not use it to access "free" music, or "free" programs... images... and so on and so forth. I have had my fair share of songs I got from LimeWire. And if I could, I would return them to the artists and companies that worked hard to make them. <br>  <br>      * Here is some info regarding P2P software and file-sharing. If only people would just take the time to read the fine print. I've visited the websites of a few popular file-sharing software distributors and looked for disclaimers, TOS, End User Licenses, etc. I have only quoted bits of relevant information to give you an idea of what to expect. For more detailed info, follow the links I've provided or visit the sites yourself for the full text. Continue reading to see what I found. <br>  <br>      * LimeWire itself is legal. Downloading any copyrighted song that you do not pay a royalty fee on is illegal and is stealing, unless the artist has given his/her permission to do so. The legality of most P2P sites is questionable, at best. Will you be prosecuted? More than likely not, but the question of legality is another matter. This entire issue has not been resolved as of yet. Could you be prosecuted? Possibly. It is your choice. Agree or disagree, this is how a friend of mine -- a lawyer -- explained it to me. <br>  <br>      * It's been said again and again. Yes, LimeWire is legal. But not everything you choose to do with it is.|`|ucpKJcuKaa	NO! not at all, unless you download files that dont have a license, which everyone does anyway. but,,, LIMEWIRE IS STILL THE BOMB-DIGGITY!!!|`|50QL9aGsaa	Frostwire isnt , thts a better virus free webby , but yes limewire is but only if u get the PRO version 5.011|`|shvhqxLZaa	Yes. Only if you buy limewire Pro, then it's legal.|`|egqEsSMraa	Yes it is illegal. They have even started to slow down people's computers if they get caught using it.|`|HV8cRf9Paa	Yes, but there is a low percent of chance that you will get arrested or have to pay because of it. And it has a lot of viruses too!

FNzUrpayaa	I agree that AVG isnt as good as some of the commercial product, but superior to Norton.  I personally have Nod32 Antivirus and Outpost Firewall.  Probably the best protection out there.  As long as you only have 1 firewall running you should be ok. Just make sure your Windows Firewall is turned off too ;)|`|sYxUVBvPaa	yes you can run two firewalls at the same time but it is going to be a pain for you to install any program or get anything off the internet. also UNINSTALL AVG and get yourself a good antivirus program or it will only end in tears. That program is one of the worst I've ever seen for antivirus even by free standards. Just remember, if you don't pay for it, your not protected|`|AA11579822	Not being familiar with Outpost Pro, my experience with Firewalls is that you can have multiple ones but only one can be running at all times.  However, you cannot have two anti-virus software programs installed at the same time.  You must remove one of them and only keep one at all times.  They conflict with each other.<br>  <br>  A better FREE anti-virus program is Avast! Search on the internet for it.  You do have to register it, but it is a great program and free to use for home use.

Just enter the average formula in the first row of the new column and copy it down.  And finally format that curve to make it stand out.

Being that it stopped at 4.7 GB It tells me that your external hard drive is formatted in FAT32.  Which can only support a max of 4.7GB file size.<br>  <br>  You need to either: <br>  A) use outlook to make the file size smaller. or <br>  B) Backup your external Hard Drive and format it from FAT32 to NTFS.  (note: Formatting to NTFS means it will not be recognized by windows ME or earlier operating systems)<br>  <br>  To format to NTFS in Windows XP/Vista just right click on the drive and select format.  In the File System box select NTFS.  Then checkmark quick format and click start.  Then transfer your large pst file to your external drive.<br>  <br>  Good Luck HTH.

Puz4ggr8aa	Try creating the table the way you want it by selecting a blank two column range and inserting the scatter chart.  Note the data table outline that is visible on the worksheet whenever the chart is selected.<br>  <br>  Then enter the X values starting outline area of the first (leftmost) column, a label for you Y series in the first (top) cell of the second column, and the Y values in the rest of the second column.  This could be accomplish by retyping, copy paste from existing data, or placing cell references in the data table.  <br>  <br>  But the first time enter a few negative X values by typing to see what the chart does.  You should see the chart adjust the X axis while you are entering the X values.   <br>  <br>  I think that sometimes it is easier to make the chart the way you want it from the start than to try to convince the Chart Wizard what you want with changes later.<br>  <br>  ADDED+++++++++++++++++<br>  <br>  I have created many scatter charts with multiple data series and never experienced the problem you describe.  Perhaps it is because I have always created my charts with the x axis values in the first (left) column.  Have you experienced the problem with the x values in that location?<br>  <br>  If not but you are stuck with the current column order, consider creating the data table with the x values in the first column elsewhere (even in a different worksheet) and filling it by using cell references to the original data.

Do those things and then consider that you might have a software problem.<br>  <br>  Just inserting a card does not mean it will work.<br>  <br>  You did not specify what Operating System you have. I will assume that you have WINDOWS Vista. Under the 'Start' menu Go to 'Settings and 'Control Panel' . You should see am alphabetical list of items. Select and double click  'Device Manager'. Let it build the alphabetical  list of hardware. Select Display adapters as that is what you NVidia card is. You should see 'Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT' listed there. If so, double-click it. You should see a window come up that says 'Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT Properties'. Look to see that under 'Device Status' it says 'This device is working properly.' If it does then the problem is not with the card and it must be a problem between the card and monitor. If it does not say that select the 'Tab' that says 'Driver'. In the lower half of window that appears, you should see five buttons. The fourth one down will likely say Enable which means the card needs to be turned on in software. Double-click that button and then check your monitor.

AA11346514	Not a good idea.  Please, if you can't afford a new computer, find a reputable dealer in your area and look at what they have.  A computer that will be used in business, even a small one, must be dependable, reasonably up to date on the operating system (probably needs Vista at least) and plenty of disk storage.  You can supplement the computer's disk with external disk storage fairly economically.  Given that you can buy a new laptop from Dell for about $500, you will probably get more power for less with a used computer from a reputable secondary market dealer.  "Wiping" a hard drive is easy if re-use is the only criteria.  "Starting from scratch" requires installing the operating system and software desired.  Be aware that you must have a valid license for most software in order to install it.  Good luck.|`|m80e3y1Eaa	Be very, very suspicious of any computer that costs $100. Just because it "looks good" means very little in terms of the specs-- how big is the hard drive? What is the processor speed? These are very important things to keep in mind when looking for a computer that will last awhile. <br>  <br>  Additionally, what is the warranty? The slamming-closed issue sounds like it will cause problems very quickly (particularly with the screen), and computer repairs add up fast when not covered by any kind of a warranty.|`|J38v75bvaa	if her online business is her way of making money you shouldnt buy a used one at all. spend the extra money and get a new one. you would kick yourself in the butt if it happened to have a virus on it and it wiped her business clean out of the comp. <br>  <br>  just buy a new one. i bought my new dell in 04 for $600 and it till works great|`|d20evTAwaa	dude dont be cheap buy her a nice like 1000 dollar comp new or even more that computer will be crap|`|dec53da7ace2edfec70ed4fcba15cd43aa	If your wife is running a online business then she will need one to do business any time anywhere but you have to make her understand with a laptop comes more risks of people getting her information because it will come with wifi or bluetooth.

Believe someone who has been there.  If you want to have a nice night/week/year, you will hand her something worthwhile or nothing until you can find something that will not cause her constant effort to take care of.   Keep using the borrowed one until an actually usable without constant hassle computer is found.  Have you ever asked "What's wrong?" and heard "Oh, nothing."  Ignore at your own peril.<br>  <br>  Good relationship advise from a psychology major married dude.<br>  <br>  Our kids got a decent one free through their church.  I finished clearing out things that hadn't been removed because it had not been formatted before they got it.<br>  <br>  If you insist on risking the tranquility of your marital relationship, formatting the HD to wipe the computer will not be a large problem, because you are receiving instead of sending the laptop.  Your info is safe in other words.  Format the old stuff off and install the new OS which may already be done since you are buying it.  This will clear all old stuff, good or bad, off the laptop.

XcLrEdxEaa	keep in mind thats a netbook not a laptop and its going to be very hard to find a laptop like that in that price range, so you should try looking for a used one. i know how it is i looked for the longest time and i gave up and bought a desktop. good luck|`|m80e3y1Eaa	Most if not all of the computers in that price range will be netbooks, which are not the same as notebooks/laptops. They generally have lesser capabilities, though it doesn't sound like you're going to be making huge demands on the system anyway. However, the integrated webcam in a notebook under $400 is pretty unlikely. <br>  <br>  If refurbished is an option, I'd look into that. Sites like overstock.com, tigerdirect.com, and sometimes the computer manufacturer themselves sell refurbished laptops.|`|8BrFjurRaa	I personally prefer lenovo which is IBM they are professional grade and very hight quality but can come at a very high price.

Computers do weird things.  I would try turning off your wireless device on the laptop and restarting.  If that does not work delete the connection and start over.  Also take it to a wireless hot spot like Panera or something and see if it can recognize that network.  Maybe the wireless device is broken or malfunctioning.|`|5z83cJVsaa	sometimes the network is slower on some laptops. give it time. if this does not work go to the help section and there are numerous things you can do, i usually search for for it or sometimes the wireless gets shut off.<br>  there's also a thing you can click which searchs for the problem <br>  try those
oDvIxpbaaa	The nVidia 9800GT has it's own graphics processor, so you shouldn't worry at all about the CPU being bottlenecked by the GPU. What you should be concerned about is your power supply; is it rated for that particular card? I have an XFX nVidia 9800GT card powered by a 500 watt power supply and I don't seem to be having any power problems.|`|uTFuciitaa	possibly slightly but i reakon that it should run fine|`|d3ad8545c7b9175df8ca7dc65b5c8eccaa	Well it will still bottleneck the 9800 GT a small bit, and you will notice it with frame rate slow down, but if you get a better heatsink then you should be able to overclock the CPU to 2.4 GHz. I originally own a Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 @ 2.4 GHz, it ran okay with my 9800 GTX+ Superclocked+ but, there was still a bit of bottleneck. I would suggest spending $200 on a Core 2 Duo E8400 @ 3.0 GHz(I currently have one), or a Core 2 Duo Q6600 for around the same price.<br>  But I would not really get my hopes up about having great performance with that processor.<br>  Have a nice day<br>  Ken|`|DQtD9P9Haa	I think that at 2.4gHz, a high end video card like this will experience bottlenecks only with the newest games. If you don't have a good amount of RAM (3GB) then you might experience very small frame stutters during high resolution gaming. This shouldn't be a majour issue for most games; but overclocking the video card is out of the question.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	The processor doesn't directly affect your video card's bandwidth.  The only time you'll have problems is when the main processor can't keep up with the GPU when it comes to updating physics, bots/AI, etc. for every frame.<br>  <br>  So no, the processor won't bottleneck your video card, but it wouldn't anyway.|`|71blBLQiaa	No it shouldn't do.

Ns8msHNeaa	Thanks for a pretty detailed question, allows for an easy diagnostic of the situation. ;)<br>  <br>  I have had a similar issue, you might think it to be the GPU or something similar, but that is most likely not it. Your RAM is most likely the problem. If it is not properly mounted to the motherboard you will get a black screen. This is because your PC NEEDs the RAM to boot up. <br>  <br>  To resolve the issue:<br>  <br>  Open up your PC.<br>  Remove the RAM.<br>  Place them in one at a time and ensure that the tabs are fully locked into place.<br>  Close it up and reboot PC.<br>  <br>  I am 99% sure that this is the cause of your issue. <br>  <br>  Good luck. ;)|`|ld5J5zO7aa	Make sure your video card is properly seated in the AGP or PCI slot.

AA11849917	Object Oriented Programming (AKA OOP) is good for modeling "real world" environments.<br>  <br>  A door has certain components that are common to ALL doors (such as hinges) from which all doors are modeled after; but some doors can have additional components, such as a window.<br>  <br>  Modeling this with OOP, the windowed door is built from the basic door, and then things can be added or modified.<br>  <br>  Doors can be "Open" or "closed"; the doorknobs can be plain or fancy.  You design the "door" from the basic "door" model (i.e. class), which "inherits" everything from the "door" class.<br>  <br>  Once you have created a class based on a base class, you can build on it, modify it, add to it, etc.<br>  <br>  The class will have properties (with the door, can select the type of wood, the color, how many hinges, the type of knob, etc), and functions ("open door", "close door", "lock door", etc.)<br>  <br>  These are all done in OOP, and is not easily duplicated in procedural programming.<br>  <br>  The example I gave is very simple, and rather incomplete, but I hope it helps you to see the power of OO programming.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	Procedural is good for quick hacks. OO is the only way to do a big project and stay sane. OO hides and protects code that you don't need to see. It makes reusing easy. It simplifies interfacing to other people's code by providing public methods so that you "what" something does and you don't have to look at the code to see "How".|`|vpv0VRZPaa	webdesign software<br>  <a href="http://cofecup.info/" rel="nofollow">http://cofecup.info/</a><br>  <a href="http://webdesign-tip.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://webdesign-tip.blogspot.com/</a>

Ns8msHNeaa	My first thought:<br>  <br>  This may be an issue with your cache.<br>  <br>  Your cache is a deposit for all of the temporarily downloaded files onto your PC which allows content to run smootly, rather than constantly streaming the content it pulls it directly from your PC.<br>  <br>  Depending on which browser you use, how to check your available cache size varies. Try to increase your cache size.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  This is all assuming that you have a good internet connection that is relatively fast.|`|rBR6akgqaa	It has to do with your connection speed, and the type of connection.

xERzGZ6Baa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5.

Getting more RAM may be part of the solution to your problem, however it appears that there is more to your situation. <br>  <br>  Here are some vital tips: <br>  <br>  (1) Launch the task manager (Ctrl-Alt-Del) and click on the field "Mem Usage" to filter for the programs (top-down) that are committing the most memory.  Note that your machine allocates a certain amount of VM (Virtual Memory) to the HDD and caches a good portion (sometimes 1.5 times the physical RAM capacity) of the RAM.  This is why the total memory usage exceeds the physical RAM capacity. <br>  <br>  (2) Filter for CPU in the task manager and check for the process that is using the most CPU time.  If you do not recognize the name of the process, then do a search for a description--try to narrow down the process(es) that are hogging your CPU time.  <br>  <br>  (3) Check help forums on the subject and see if others are having a similar difficulty.  Example: about a year ago, I installed google desktop and found that it was taking about 90% of my CPU time (and slowing down the machine).  I used some key word searches to locate others who had my problem--it was eventually traced back to an issue with the google desktop application, which would not relinquish resources after coming out of idle (i.e. indexing services, etc).  I uninstalled the application and got my system back in order.  <br>  <br>  (3) Check your HDD free space.  Since you have about 384 Mb of RAM, you should have at least twice that in free HDD space (i.e. for VM).  <br>  <br>  (4) Run scandisk and disk defragmenter (in that order) -- you can access these under the "tools" tab in the properties menu of your (C: or D:) drive..  The defrag utility will analyze your disk and check for fragmentation--it will even tell you beforehand if defragmentation is necessary.  <br>  <br>  (5) Noticed you had LimeWire installed--make sure your peer-to-peer clients aren't hogging your resources--as a rule, I turn them off (most of these clients default to running in the background on startup--adding your bandwidth and files to the collective downloading hysteria of others.)

Ns8msHNeaa	From my experience:<br>  <br>  Having used an IMAC and also having owned multiple PCs, I found that most Macs are VERY user friendly. They seem to be an OS that was made for the average consumer. Whereas windows XP would appear to be a business OS that doubled as a consumer OS.<br>  <br>  Is it a hard switch?:<br>  <br>  - I would say 'no'. The hardest thing would be the mouse. (that is if you get a mouse, you mentioned a 'mac book')<br>  The settings, by default, do not assign the mouse a 'right click' which may initially cause some issues. You can change this setting.<br>  - Widgets are included in Macs which are small application that allow you to access things like the weather, calculators, current gas prices, even simple games.<br>  <br>  Will I lose all of my music (i tunes) and everything else i have on my computer?:<br>  <br>  No, for the most part. Itunes is an APPLE application. Apple makes the Mac computers. So the transfer of your itunes music wouldn't even begin to be an issue. Other documents and such from the PC to the Mac shouldn't be an issue. Macs have similar software to Windows. (e.g. wordpad would be textedit) Most files should transfer flawlessly.<br>  <br>  What advantages do macs have over PCs or even PCs over macs?:<br>  <br>  I would consider Macs to be far more user friendly than any PC. Compatability with applications and games aren't an issue either. If you have an XP or VISTA disk, you can download for free the 'bootcamp' application available from Apple which allows you to dual boot between the Mac OS and any Windows or Linux OS. This would solve any compatability issues.<br>  <br>  Which is better?:<br>  <br>  Neither is really "better", it seems to be preference.<br>  <br>  Is it worth getting a mac book?:<br>  <br>  Absolutely, In my opinion, Macs are worth every penny that you put into them. They're safer than PCs, this is because most computer users in the world have a windows OS, so viruses and such are based towards the larger audience and NOT towards the few and far between Mac OS. They come with bundled software. Great technical support. User friendly and come with pretty good hardware.|`|l8tmWJw0aa	Get a MAC!!  They are WAY better!<br>  The switch is not hard, just getting used to the format of things, but I find it MUCH easier to find things that I want.<br>  Use a thumb drive to move your stuff.<br>  Macs tend not to get viruses, but they can still get some like worms, but even if they do get them usually the virus can't do anything because they are made for PCs.<br>  <br>  Definitely get a Mac!!!|`|NJEyolRqaa	well i know for sure you will lose the stuff on your computer. i dont know about itunes. but you will lose everything else|`|Z98TpALPaa	I personally think that if you buy a Mac, you're just paying for the name.

c0UakxMMaa	* If i get the mac is it a hard switch?<br>  absolutely not. i am a PC tech and have been for over 5 years, used every windows OS from windows 3.1 to windows vista, bought an iphone and was intrigued with it so i researched macs a little, decided to buy a 24" iMac. now i have that and a MacBook Pro Late 2008 model. i cannot see myself ever switching back. they are considerably easier to use, operate faster and smoother, and are just all around a great machine. if for some reason later down the road you decide you need to use windows, install it on boot camp. last year the fastest computer to run windows vista was an Apple MacBook Pro.<br>  <br>  * Will i lose all of my music (i tunes) and everything else i have on my computer?<br>  no, you can easily transfer the files, either over a network or by connecting the hard drive via an adapter to the mac<br>  <br>  * What advantages do macs have over PCs or even PCs over macs?<br>  Mac>PC:<br>  speed<br>  smoothness<br>  ease of use<br>  compatibility<br>  PC>Mac:<br>  gaming<br>  <br>  * Which is better?<br>  Macs by far<br>  <br>  * Is it worth getting a mac book?<br>  If you have the extra money i would get a macbook pro, get 2.4" bigger screen, faster CPU and RAM bus speeds, and not too big of a price jump. i got my MBP for $1500 brand new off of eBay. but no matter what you get as long as its a mac you will be satisfied.|`|JWnQM1soaa	Supposedly the MAC people have a software that can transfer files from a PC to a MAC.<br>  <br>  For iTunes, you jst need to transfer ur account (i think) The people at the store will help u<br>  <br>  The only dif is the Operating system (you can get XP/Vista to look like the MAC OS)<br>  <br>  The choice is personal.<br>  <br>  If you have the money, get a MAC.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go to an Apple store and try out a Mac.<br>  If you like (and have Xtra $$$ get a MAC.<br>  <br>  If u don't really care, get a laptop to suite ur needs.

tIDNEwdMaa	Don't listen to the ones who tell you not to get a Mac.  Once you learn the Mac, you will realize that the most compelling reasons these people give to not buy a Mac, are also the most bogus.  There are few things that Windows does better than a Mac that significant.<br>  <br>  I left Windows ten years ago, but still use Windows at work (no choice).  Apple would have to make a major, stupid change to their market model in order to make me go back to using Windows at home.<br>  <br>  A computer is a tool.  It should help you accomplish a task.  With Windows, you spend too much time working on your tools instead of with your tools.<br>  <br>  Mac users are 10% of the users.  Macs are less than 10% of the computer problem we read about here.  If Windows is superior, then why do Windows users have more than their fair share of troubles?|`|puzz1Nf4aa	It's just as easy to use as a Windows pc.

My advice: go for it!|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	Not really, the biggest thing to get over is the fact there is no right click (you press the Control button and click).  Make sure you read the manuals for your Mac when you get it.|`|0y6V15hbaa	no it's really easy to learn, plus it has a thing called boot camp so you can use windows still if your not feeling the mac operating system.|`|IGXE3aDraa	no its not at all. when i converted it was easy. the hardest thing to get use to was closing a window instead of going to the top right you went to the top left. honestly that was the hardest thing to get use to. everything is in your dock and whats not is in your finder. its really makes a lot more sense. now five years after my conversion, I have a hard time with Windows because its confusing. plus you dont have all the virus issues. also if you live near a mac store, you can sign up for help. you pay a yearly fee i think, but you make an appointment and they will answer any and all questions on the mac in front of you like a tutor. my mom 70+ she did this and shes got her computer down pat, while others are fumbling.

7ToeKBzYaa	Hi dude,<br>  <br>  There's no type of string in C++ compiler, what kind of compiler are you using?<br>  usually strings are defined as char* type in c++, anyway in your case I recommend you something like this:<br>  <br>  for (int dimension=0;a[dimension][0];dimension++)...<br>  <br>  OR using try & catch blocks maybe a good idea<br>  <br>  int i=0<br>  try<br>  {<br>   string temp;<br>   for (; 1; i++)<br>   {<br>    temp = a[i];<br>   }<br>  }<br>  // type of exception is not important to us so<br>  // you can use catch{dimension = i;} instead.<br>  catch(OutOfRangeException err)<br>  {<br>   dimension = i;<br>  }<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	This is because "a" is a pointer. "string" is also a pointer. These pointers are probably both 4 bytes. So 4/4=1 always.|`|2SSA9e9Naa	How did you declare the array? Perhaps try sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);<br>  <br>  It is a common trick I use to find the entries of an array. Divide its total size by the size of it's first element.|`|Uuw4usixaa	Yep, sizeof(a) will return 1 because the it sees only the address of a.<br>  <br>  You can loop over the elements of a and take the strlen() of each one.  The size of a is just the sum of the strlens plus the number of elements in the array (because each string contains a null terminator).

If it's a desktop computer it may be as serious as replacing the system board to correct the issue because the CMOS battery is soldered on the board. If it's a laptop then all you'll need to do is get the internal battery replaced. It should be removable.

hGZyXIFcaa	If your looking at gaming downgrade to 32.|`|3d6bn4Qzaa	Every operating system that has ever been written or ever will be written has/does/will have program conflicts.  Perhaps you could be more specific?<br>  <br>  I use Win2000, WinXP-32, Ubuntu, Suse, RedHat, WinVista-32, WinVista-64, Win7-32 and Win7-64.  They all have their own issues, program conflicts, driver problems, and they each require a different level of patience and finese.  But I must say, all of those operating systems work just fine, depending on what programs I am trying to run.  Keep in mind that the software vendors ( 3rd party ) writing the programs that are undoubtedly giving you trouble are the ones to blame for not writing their code openly enough.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you if you want full use of your 4GB of RAM, you will need something other than WinXP-32 or Vista-32.  My Vista-64 and both Win7's recognize all 4GB of my RAM.  <br>  <br>  Can you be more specific as far as conflicts are concerned?<br>  <br>  <br>  I have had no problems gaming under Windows 7 ( 32-bit or 64-bit ) or under Vista.  I admit Vista is a big of a hog, but Win7 clears up a lot of that.  All of my HL and HL2 engine games, Unreal engine games, etc. all work just fine at max res and highest textures, etc.|`|AA12271834	I've been using the Win 7 Beta for a bit and it is ok.  There is almost no support for third party apps like OpenGL which sucks as I have a lot of games that run on OpenGL.  There are driver problems as well but not as many as Vista 64bit.  <br>  I would'nt switch to 32-bit XP/Vista as you will loose half the functionality of your RAM (32-bit can only handle up to 2GB RAM).<br>  <br>  I would try out Win 7 Beta as a dual install with your current OS and see if that helps.  If not then I would start looking at XP 32bit.|`|puzz1Nf4aa	Windows 7 is great, a major improvement over Vista, in my opinion. I am actually typing this reply using Windows 7. Don't use it as your main operating system, though. It is a beta, and expires in August. If you don't want to use Windows at all, try Linux. Kubuntu is great, so is openSUSE, and Fedora.

1h0zRtJfaa	The ingame voice chat has always been problematic. I've only seen one or two times where people requested the ingame voice chat be used, one random group, and one when our vent was down.<br>  <br>  Odds are if the ingame program is only picking up static, 1 of 2 things is occurring. 1.) the microphone setting has way too high of a sensitivity setting, and it is picking up evry noise around you, or 2.) and most likely, your sound card if creating a feedback loop. If you have in game sounds going out the same device your microphone is coming into, the device would be creating the feedback loop. One way to test this is to use a USB headset to try and isolate the outbound sound to the headset, while using the mic as intended, or turning off the internal speakers and using external speakers through the jack in the computer.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	what program do you use? vent or in game chat?|`|t1zJt1Nmaa	i  LLLOOOOVVEVVEVE THAT GAME!!!!! <br>  =P

A div can display page elements, but not an inline web page within a page. For that, you need an iframe tag in your XHTML code.<br>  <br>  By incorporating an iframe tag, you can specify the source of the web page in the tag.<br>  <br>  <iframe src="mywebpage.html"></iframe><br>  <br>  To apply CSS, give your iframe an ID or class name.<br>  <br>  <iframe id="innerframe" src="mywebpage.html"></iframe> or <iframe class="frameclass" src="mywebpage.html"></iframe> <br>  <br>  Then you can style the iframe with your CSS code.<br>  <br>  #innerframe {height:100px;width:300px;border-width:2... or .frameclass {height:100px;width:300px;border-width:2...<br>  <br>  To change the content with a link, use the iframe's ID as the target in your hyperlink.<br>  <br>  <a href="nextpage.html" target="innerframe">See the next page</a>|`|Elobl7qdaa	Check out CSS layouts at the following site and chose the style you want:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.code-sucks.com/css%20layouts/fixed-width-css-layouts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.code-sucks.com/css%20layouts/...</a><br>  <br>  Ron|`|c3f053e32d1e7ff0710bea42cb07d322aa	Congratulations if you're trying to get away from frames and use CSS instead.

One way is, write your html as a big container with smaller inside containers:<br>  <div id="wrapper"><br>  <div id="nav"><br>  ...your navigation ...<br>  </div><br>  <div id="content"><br>  ...your content..<br>  </div><br>  </div><br>  <br>  and the css<br>  #wrapper { width:75%; }<br>  #nav { width: 25%; float: left; overflow: hidden; }<br>  #content { width: 74%; float: left; overflow: hidden; }<br>  ...You may have to diddle the percentages.<br>  Note that the nav and content percentages are 25% and 74% of the 75%, respectively, in case it looks weird.

Ns8msHNeaa	BUDGET:<br>  <br>  You can purchase the WD PASSPORT 500GB HDD for far cheaper than the other two items, how greatly this would affect your laptop's performance would be my deciding factor. The external HDD will not affect the overall performance of your laptop, rather, it will just give you more storage space.<br>  <br>  QUALITY:<br>  <br>  If your current laptop is really old and not that good, then you may want to consider upgrading to the laptop you mentioned. I would only consider it worth the extra cost were your previous laptop outdated. <br>  <br>  LOGICAL:<br>  <br>  Most mid-size desktops are easily upgradable and easy to maintain as well. Cleaning and basic matinence are simple. I prefer desktops in most cases. Desktops are also easy to upgrade/re-install their OS.

Anything made by Corel sucks.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay... Those kind of security features that people here are describing, I've never seen before with standard windows programs.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is unarchive the folders so they're unsearchable, or again, compress them w/ winzip or other third paert programs.<br>  <br>  You can even put passwords on individual objects this way.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Many of these programs are shareware or trial versions. You could check out SourceForge to see what they have. Also note that most of these things are for the older Windows OSs.<br>  <br>  They're also not totally secure because someone can easily install a keystroke recorder if they were intent on seeing what it is you've passcoded.<br>  <br>  The guy who said to get an external flash drive got it right.

It can simultaneously encrypt, lock and password protect your files, folders, drives, USB drives and even CD/DVD-RW.<br>  <br>  Folder Lock creates encrypted storages called 'Lockers'. You can keep as many of your private files & folders in your Locker and password protect it with a single click. You can transfer, secure and backup these Lockers. Lockers are  portable, you can keep  them in USB Flash Drives, CD/DVD (R-RW), & notebooks or transfer them via email or upload. Lockers are even undeletable on the computer where Folder Lock is installed.<br>  <br>  You can create as many Lockers as you want. Different users on a single PC can create different Lockers as well. With Folder Lock, you can choose either to encrypt using 256-bit AES on-the-fly encryption or lock files, folders and drives anywhere on your computer. Each Locker can contain your encrypted files as well as your personal list of locked items.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Folder Lock's options like hack monitoring, stealth mode, data shredding, history cleaning, auto protection, portable USB autoplay feature & virtual keyboard can enhance data security beyond anything ever achieved. In addition, a locker's delete, move and rename are password protected to prevent data loss.<br>  <br>  Folder Lock is compatible on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista / 2003 / XP / 2000 & is the most downloaded File Security program in the market.|`|NcXaMI95aa	A good software to protect your files and folders with a password - Folder Castle.

Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3.

You can also see that the more redundancy, the more expensive a complex system can become.<br>  <br>  NAND gate chips are particularly easy to make and are very cheap.  So if we can make a circuit that consists of other gates entirely from NAND gates, then we can save a lot on redundancy of our resources.

If you say you 'upgraded to Vista,' then you may want to double check and make sure you did not obtain an upgrade-copy of Vista.  <br>  <br>  1) If your disc is bootable, I recommend booting up to the Vista DVD and select full customizable setup.  When you click on the partition onto which you wish to install Vista, click on the Disk Options, format the parition.  Do so for all available partitions, if possible ( you will lose everything on any partition you format! ).  Then install Vista on the desired partition cleanly.<br>  <br>  2) If you disc is only an upgrade, I recommend stealing a copy of WinXP, boot to the XP CD, delete all unnecessary partitions, create desired partition ( >= 20GB for sanity's sake ), install WinXP.  Download and install SP3 for WinXP.  Then 'upgrade' to Vista using the Vista Upgrade disc.  Once in Vista, you can create new partitions using the Disk Manager.

For example; if you have a large RAM stick, then your PC can boot quickly, run multiple programs, run programs smoothly and increase your overall PC performance. Opening up large applications such as 'Photoshop' or 'Microsoft Word' would be made quicker by additional RAM or slower by less RAM.<br>  <br>  The GPU or Graphics Processing Unit is a hardware device that renders graphics to be displayed on your monitor. The better the device, the more pristine or impressive picture you may get. Some GPUs render faster than others or support higher resolutions. Most basic computers include an integrated GPU for basic uses. Games and such require a stronger or more powerful GPU, this is because it has dedicated RAM built into it so that the RAM can then be used on the GPU specifically to help render graphics. Higher end GPUs have more built-in and/or dedicated RAM rather than borrowing from the PCs.<br>  <br>  -------------------------------<br>  Summarily, RAM allows your PC to run smoother.

It's usually C:\VSTplugins, C:\Program Files\VSTplugins, or something like that.  Other VSTs come zipped up with no installer, so all you do is unzip them in your VST plugin folder and they're ready to go.<br>  <br>  Live has to know where all these VST plugins are at.  Hit Ctrl+, (that's Ctrl and a comma) or go to Options -> Preferences to configure your File and Folder options.  Toward the bottom you should see Plug-in Sources section with a Browse button at the bottom.  Point that toward your VST directory, click on Rescan, and Live will find the VST plugins there.<br>  <br>  To load a VST in Live click on the Plugin button (third one from the top on the upper left-hand side, if you include the arrow to hide/show the browser window).  You'll get a listing of all VSTs currently located and checked by Live.  Depending on how POD Farm is set up it might load the whole suite of tools as a single VST or you might get a bunch of plugins that you can load separately.

I do agree with the technical aspect of torrents on the other answers posted here but why are you going to risk your father stuff? just because you want to get something free? If at home you have a network you have at least two computers so you are not in desperation need of whatever torrents can give you. I wouldn't do it, plain and simple.<br>  Young people don't listen as much as they should so at least, please, make sure the important stuff (your father stuff and yours) is backed up regularly. Make sure you have a good antivirus and that it is updated. Also when you are in doubt of any file just delete it or don't download it at all.<br>  Good Luck on this one!|`|iKAFO9bEaa	Bit torrent is about common sense<br>  First when you download a torrent make sure you read the comments first. if there is no comments and you download it and asked you to download some software to open it, it is most likely to be a virus some software though is safe like winrar, magic iso however the programs may be safe but the files may contain viruses so scan all files first i recommend AVG. ot os free and stops new viruses. www.torrentfreak.com is a good website for torrent news may be helpful and they find fake websites there.<br>  <br>  back up your data, seed and try and get  inti a private site like demonoid files there are likely to be safe

ickyq53aaa	You could download 'Audacity', a free audio editing program.  Then find a beat you like, open the file that has the beat (.wav, .mp3, whatever) in Audacity.  Chop the part that has the beat you want to scratch over, or whatever, and copy & paste a bunch of times, to loop it.  Then you can use a interface such as the 'Mbox 2' to plug in your turntables and record on top of the track.  Then export the song and you're done.  It is actually pretty easy, you just have to buy an interface so you can plug your turntables into your computer.  Or you could use a physical mixer, like an 8 track.  If you need more advice, email me.  If you tell me exactly what you want to do I can help more.  Do you want to make your own drum beats, or use other peoples breaks?  If you want to make your own drum beats, that will mean you need another program.  Look into Reason 4.0, it is amazingly incredibly powerful and fun.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi.

It could be a number of things.. Could be your graphics card, your processor, your computer might be getting too hot..

Just make sure to put all the stuff you want to keep on those Dvds.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work then your hardware is faulty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Its not your RAM, i've had 1GB of RAM for so long, and it has never stopped me from enjoying "graphic intense" games..

9rEv8vemaa	Hi there! I had the same exact problem. I just answered someone else's question this. There's a way around it.<br>  <br>  First: when you hit login and the technical glitch thing comes up just keep on hitting the refresh button a couple of times. The login in page should come up.<br>  <br>  Then: Type in all your info and hit Enter. Now this is where you have to have patience. A pop will say something about whether you want to cancel or retry. Press retry and then refresh the page. Keep doing that back and forth for a while. Then it should take your account<br>  <br>  Now... after that everything is basically continous. If you click on anything and the technical thing comes up just refresh the page a couple of times again and the page you want should come up<br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO HAVE PATIENCE AND DETERMINATION! Trust me..|`|WA2blg1baa	I would guess the servers crashed on Saturday night and they can't even access their own site. They probably don't have people checking it on the weekend to see if it's running.

fE7zhp3Caa	You can try clearing CMOS to remove the old CPU configuration, but I would lean more towards the possibility that your motherboard just doesn't support the new processor.  Most OEM computers (Dell, HP, Compaq, Gateway, etc.) use lower grade motherboards with limited or no processor upgrade capabilities.  While this is no longer as universal as it was even 2 or 3 years ago, it's still the most likely cause of your problem.  The only way to know for sure is to look up your motherboard's specs and see the maximum CPU it supports.<br>  <br>  The reference to 3 holes versus 4 holes doesn't make any sense, unless you're talking about the number of pins required by the CPU's heatsink fan.  If that's the case, as long as you have the correct 3 pins connected it will work (+12VDC, ground, and a lead for the RPM sensor).|`|ryjnt3dhaa	Call HP support and check if their motherboard will support the cpu you installed.  HP stock motherboards have been tweaked by HP to work only with what HP intended it to work with.  If you're talking about the connector on a new power supply then try the old one to see if it works.|`|SzK3zRMSaa	You need to reinstall Windows after upgrading the CPU or motherboard, but you aren't at that point yet.<br>  <br>  The Beeps are trying to tell you something.

2vUOqAikaa	Yes. AT&T does have a security suite. You have to manually download it though. Just having AT&T as your service provider doesn't mean that the virus protection, is downloaded automatically to your computer. You will have to go and download it yourself. Also, at one point this security suite of theirs, would cost. It's been awhile so I am not sure if you still have to pay for it. All AT&T customers may get it for free now, I am not entirely sure. At any rate, sign in to AT&T and then go to memeber center. From here, go to products and services. Next, look under online protection and there is where you'll see the security suite available for download.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	download and install avg free edition. been useing it for around 7 yrs and it is the best i have found. far better than norton or mcafee, but that really doesn't take much.|`|ld5J5zO7aa	If your computer says you dont, then you probably dont.

The computers will each think they have a private/local IP address (often 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x).  When one of the computers sends out a message to an Internet site, the router will change the "from" IP address in the outgoing packet to be the shared public IP address, and when the reply comes back the router will adjust the "to" IP address to be the correct computer's private/local IP address.  (The router uses "port numbers" to keep track of which packets go to which computers.)

I84cekfHaa	Kaspersky.  If you install that program in express installation, it does everything for you.  When it detects a threat, it does it automatically, when you install or open the program for the first time, it automatically puts in different categories of rules for firewall settings.  The only thing you need to do really is to sort out the vulnerabilities when it detects out of date Java, Adobe, Windows, browsers and etc.  It is really pretty much a program that you can leave and forget.<br>  <br>  Go for kasperky Internet Security 2009.  I use it myself and I'm happy with it.  But bear in mind, that if it detects a threat, it creates a back-up and it would be on 'Detected' so that you can restore or heal later.  This function has baffled many users, thinking that the threat is still there, but Kaspersky have already dealt with the threat.  But once you learnt how Kaspersky deals with it, leave it and forget about it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kaspersky.co.uk/kaspersky_internet_security" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaspersky.co.uk/kaspersky_int...</a>|`|uuDloQnCaa	ESET smart security is the simple yet very effective<br>  <br>  User reviews:<br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/ESET-Smart-Security/3000-2239_4-10807868.html?tag=mncol" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/ESET-Smart-Secur...</a><br>  Official site:<br>  <a href="http://www.eset.com/smartsecurity/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eset.com/smartsecurity/</a>

3GmG8uQzaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	I bet that it is the Anti-Virus thing telling you that your computer is about to crash. And it is holding your PC to ransom and it is most certainly a scam and is trying to steal your money.<br>  <br>  You need a real anti virus. Why didn't you have one already? The free edition of AVG should do the trick.

fXvOEZ8Yaa	There's only one way to get the data in Google updated:<br>  Wait :-)<br>  The Google Spider has to drop by your website, see the changes, and updated the Google data accordingly. However, there is good news! You can tell Google something has changed on your website, and ask the Google Spider to drop by a little sooner. To do this, you need to go to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmaster," rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/webmaster,</a> create an account there, add your website, and add a sitemap.xml file as described on the pages there.<br>  If you update the sitemap.xml file everytime you changed something on your website, and you tell google it has changed (via the webmaster interface), the spider will drop by rather soon to take a look.|`|3EsVv1J1aa	Sign in to google webmaster tools and read about how to create and submit a site map.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Different languages were designed for different things.  Perl is a text manipulation language.  Lisp is a list handling language.<br>  <br>  It's like saws - they all cut, but you use a hacksaw, a jeweler's saw and a chainsaw for different purposes.|`|7j9Hj02caa	First of all they arent programming languages, they are scripting languages and they are meant for building web pages and are used for stuff like comments
53sVKcOeaa	Hotmail offers 5Gb's of space for holding personal documents it can be accessed anywhere by yourself and is free. Otherwise you could try a website like bravehost or another free file hosting site.|`|PGMIrRrAaa	Your ISP probably offers you freespace as part of your Internet package.<br>  <br>  Why not upload your Word documents to your free webspace?<br>  <br>  You will need an ftp program to upload them there (and download them as well).|`|AA10354413	you could always use gmail.com as it is unlimited space and completely free unlike yahoo and hotmail. Gmail even offers free POP3. Though Office live maybe the best of the choices.

It is also three applications for less than the one.<br>  <br>  But, the other person's suggestion of trying Open Office is with a look.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I think you can use openoffice.org with your mac and it's free and works just like msoffice.

fna4b3Oqaa	I use FireFox and Google Chrome.  <br>  <br>  Chrome is based on webkit so it starts faster and renders websites faster than either FireFox or IE..  It also runs each tab as a separate process so if you encounter a malfunctioning webpage only the tab that site is in will crash instead of the entire browser.  FireFox & IE don't have that ability.<br>  <br>  FireFox is honestly my favorite though.  Its got endless 3rd party addons to enhance its feature set, its open source, its secure, if it crashes it recovers all the pages you were on b4 the crash & its standards compliant.<br>  <br>  Really an all around awesome application.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	A handy arrangement is 'dual browser' session:<br>  You can have as many different browsers open as you want at the same time , without significant slowdowns (if the site is not overly 'robust').<br>  Attacks from the internet, using 'blended' methods are becoming more pronounced & Windows users are especially vulnerable due to the systems flexibility which permits remote machines to enter & access other 3rd party applications on your machine and get it to do something it was not intended to do.<br>  This is especially true of using browsers as 'launchpads' for payload delivery.  IE, being deeply woven into Windows, is a prime target, and makes using Firefox, with 'noScript' add on even more urgent.<br>   <br>  Use Firefox for general & everyday surfing needs, especially to sites you don't know anything about.  Depending on how many plug-in's and add-on's you "hang" onto FF, it's faster than IE, & inherently safer.<br>  Download site: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/</a><br>  <br>  Try viewing a site with FF first, and if it does not allow the interaction you require, switch & use IE (via "copy" the URL from FF & "paste" into IE) but only when it's absolutely necessary; or to use 'Active X' or 'Flash' scripting: Use these at your own peril.  <br>  Flip back to FF when finished.<br>  Special note for both browsers:  "Logged In" sites must be "logged out" when finished, to terminate 'session cookies'.<br>  **************<br>  Note:  Current threats include 'Antivirus 2009' or variants.<br>  Because architecture of the Internet (notably 'Flash' scripting), vulnerabilities are readily exploited in Internet Explorer, & it is now >>urgent<< that you use Firefox with current 'NoScript' add-on, which will prevent "opacity-based attacks".<br>  NoScript: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox..." rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...</a><br>  <br>  This dual set-up will drastically reduce web based threats to your system, with low system overhead.|`|t8SCvpgfaa	I don't know whats the exact reasons but i prepare for you to use fire fox. though it needs more space but more comfortable rather than IE|`|9kfjIRLyaa	Firefox is like 10 times better. It is lighter, more secure, more customizable. More websites appear better on Firefox because it is WC3 compliant, whereas Internet Explorer can butcher pages sometimes.|`|eow59EaEaa	I have always had tons of problems with Internet Explorer. I have not had a problem since I switched to Firefox about a year and a half ago.|`|71blBLQiaa	Firefox is considered faster, safer and more secure than any other browser. It is also highly recommended by myself for it's customizability and add-on features.|`|23qCtLvIaa	firefox is much safer, faster, Has alot more features then ie, has more tweaks, scans for viruses on download, Cookie control, bookmarks that dont slow down your system and more cheers!|`|cVl5OEPSaa	i used internet explorer for years. i didn't realize my computer had firefox until a few weeks ago. i tried it and like it A LOT more. it is a lot faster and seems a lot more trustworthy than internet explorer.|`|UBwWBiLTaa	fire fox
JsnlGErhaa	Colanth is exactly correct! Those are the major languages that web uses (and a few others such as ruby on rails etc... But it's complicated)<br>  If you want I could try code you something, I'm a good coder but rubbish with images, so if you have a design in mind and have lots of images for it I could code it in HTML/CSS/PHP (providing it's not a habbo related football team.

That is why you are always told to put the router in the main incoming telephone socket.<br>  <br>  If you system is wireless then connect the router downstairs and you should be able to pick up the signal upstairs still.<br>  <br>  If it is wired, then a long ethernet wire is better than a long telephone connection.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you have the filters connected to each of the telephone sockets that have a device connected to them|`|EmhamnELaa	I am assuming you have DSL, if so, contact your company, and let them know what is happening|`|CW2irxNRaa	maybe you don't have phone filter, or it's in the wrong place.

hYegtSKxaa	honestly ,  myspace is relatively safe i would say .. as long as your smart - i mean if you go posting your address and location phone number etc etc on say yahoo answers then it is going to be an unsafe site and thats the same with myspace , play it smart - only add friends .. and dont go and give out your address or meet some one somewhere ..just use common sense , oh and set your profile to private !!|`|LE58Pj37aa	It really depends! As long as you have your porfile private only accept friends requests from people you know, you'll be good! But myspace also has many other options to help keep you safe check out their saftey part of their website!  I personally have to say tmost of the girls who do go missing are generally not taking steps to keep themselves safe. You can prevent that from happening to you! Also never give out your adress or cell phone number to strangers!|`|DtRREPATaa	It just depends how much information that you decide to put out there about yourself.<br>  I mean I guess just watch what you put and who you're talking to.|`|dEyKgKs9aa	NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.<br>  <br>  unless you post pictures of yourself half <br>  nude and add 56 year old guys. ahaha.<br>  <br>  ohh, and if you give them your address<br>  then that's bad too.|`|5aa6c255769d2581cd3da1bfae8f73bbaa	Myspace is perfectly safe, as long as you use it as it was intended.. i.e. Social networking with people you know.

Vista will come with a DVD, or there will be a recovery partition, or you should have made a recovery DVD set when you bought the machine. Use one of those methods first.|`|PXNPL5Ivaa	just do a system reboot/restore on your pc and it will wipe everything off it and make it exactly like it was when it came.|`|zIgsjQ76aa	If you purchased your laptop brand new chances are although you don't have either a secondary hard-drive which could or could not be hidden on the Computer page on your OS...<br>  <br>  The best way to find out if you have this is to restart your computer and at the BIOS boot screen hit the select boot device button (usually F12) and find the hard-drive that isn't usually shown, tends to be D:<br>  <br>  If you own a CD key then downloading the Vista program from a torrent is perfectly legal just be careful often these downloads are designed for laptops that come preinstalled from the shop with the CD key embedded into the install making it illegal to install that copy.<br>  <br>  Also they may come with loads of extra trial software that may be irreverent for a computer of a different make. e.g. pre-installed drivers for the intended computer which are useless for yours.<br>  <br>  If you do intend to restart from a disc that was not made for your computer I recommend copying your Wireless/Network drivers onto a disc or flash drive before reinstalling, because if you reinstall you may have problems accessing the internet to download drivers for your computer because you don't have the network drivers and you have to go hunting for CD's that you may not have.|`|EmhamnELaa	Depending on the manufacturer, there might be a recovery partition setup on the hard drive.

glFDVwklaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.<br>  Check your drivers.

bzSzCJUeaa	Wifi is wireless Internet connection. There is 2 ways of getting this. either you buy a so called wireless router, that you connect to your Internet modem (or if you have a fiber connection, you connect the router into your fiber outlet in the wall). The other method is getting a modem with wireless transmission build in. <br>  <br>  I do not know wear you live, but where I live (Sweden) a wireless router or a modem of this sort is most often provided by the ISP (Internet service provider) free of charge. If your ISP doesn't provide this service, there are however fairly cheap routers to buy in all stores that sell computers and such.<br>  <br>  Remember to change the default password on you router or modem. Your connection could easily be hacked otherwise.|`|5APcsaCfaa	I have an I-pod touch and dont have wifi for my house.

1F6KJt0oaa	Basically what I do only WIndows usually gets a much smaller partition and I usually have a shared partition that holds music and pictures so that both can access it.|`|NJBp6uJkaa	yeah, you get the best of both worlds =D|`|dfjIBHe3aa	If you've gotten it this far, yes.  If you haven't partitioned, well that can violate the warranty on your computer.  I would at very least back up the drive, read three or four tutorials on doing it -- and defrag the windows disk (assuming you have Windows on it already) before the partitioning.  If you have then just go ahead.  Make a swap partition for the linux box about equal to twice the amount of memory on the machine -- the kernel looks for it whether it needs it or not.  You can also divide the other directories into  separate partitions -- I have separate boot and home partitions, as well as two different root partitions for gentoo and slackware which use the same boot and home partitions.<br>  <br>  Dual boots are fun.  I got hooked on them while I was getting used to Linux.|`|EnHAXG8Kaa	ye i used to but i did not have enough HD space<br>  1TB is great i had 10 GB

There are also many other safety features, as for example personal questions like who was your best friend in school or the name of the school from which you graduated, or the town where you were born.<br>  I is safer if you use the http:// when you use the URL of the bank.  I have used my bank account card  to pay using Pay Pal.

bzSzCJUeaa	In my research for this problem I've found out that this problem seems to concern people that uses Firefox 3. This is probably because some sites isn't keeping up with the browser development. Try to reach the site with another browser in the mean time. <br>  <br>  There is however one thing that you can try. It doesn't seem to help everyone with this problem, but you might as well try it. Apparently SSL2 is most often disabled as default. This is because it is considered not safe. <br>  <br>   Go into the browser, open Tools -> Settings... and on the Security & Privacy tab tick the "Enable SSL2" checbox. Note that by doing so you place yourself at risk of using SSL2 with other websites that don't support SSL3 unless you disable it again.

XmnVJxzaaa	From the reviews I've read of Hybrid Crossfire*, the performance gain of adding an HD 3450 to a Hybrid Crossfire capable motherboard is about 30-70% depending on the game. As an example, if you are playing a game on the integrated graphics and getting a barely playable 20 frames per second (fps), adding the HD 3450 should bump that up to a much more playable 26-34 fps. The review I list in sources says these gains are in games like CoD4, Crysis, and Unreal Tournament 3. <br>  For the money, that kind of performance gain would make adding the HD 3450 completely worth it in my book. Especially when you consider how relatively inexpensive the HD 3450 is to purchase (some are as low as $30-40 USD). That said, I've also read that a single HD 3650 running by itself (not in Hybrid Crossfire) is almost twice as fast as the Hybrid Crossfire HD 3450. The HD 3650, while not an horrendously expensive graphics card, does cost about twice as much to buy (starting at $60 USD) .<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more information, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck.

a8eeb508e9838423866dd84a2d141f67aa	Da KiNG is right about only needing to add a check if nums[start] is 6, but the question then becomes where to add this check.  In groupSum there were 2 recursive calls, one to check if there is a solution when nums[start] is chosen and another to check if there is a solution when nums[start] is not chosen.  Because of the added constraint, if nums[start] is 6, nums[start] must be chosen.  So when nums[start] is 6, you will only return true when the first recursive condition is met.<br>  <br>  If you me to explain this better, just post an additional details.|`|uRQoj2wcaa	Hint:<br>  the only new thing you have to type is <br>  if(nums[start]==6)<br>  <br>  all of the rest, you can copy and paste from groupSum!!<br>  Hope that helps!

fna4b3Oqaa	I had this issue too...  You'll have to do a reinstall of Windows 7 to get both the OS options back... not a repair install, but a full reinstall.<br>  <br>  It sucks, but thats the way beta software rolls|`|ww500NiIaa	delete the windows 7 partition and reinstall windows 7 on a partition again.|`|3d6bn4Qzaa	As a rule, always install operating systems from the oldest to the newest.  However, I feel for your plight.  Granted, I ended up reinstalling XP then reinstalling Win7, but you can fix it without reinstalling Win7 again.  <br>  Try booting to the Win7 DVD and run the boot repair options.  As fixmbr is no longer available, you will have to use their GUI-based fixes or look up what the replacement command is for fixmbr in Vista/Win7.  <br>  You can also try editing your boot.ini file in XP if you know which partition Win7 is installed on.  You will have to open explorer -> Tools -> Folder Options -> View -> Uncheck Hide Protected OS files.  Then edit your (WinXPdrive):\boot.ini file.  <br>  <br>  Once you finally get into Vista/Win7 again, the replacement for the boot.ini file is bcdedit.exe.  Run that to manage your boot record.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesn’t seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode. <br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.

When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.

71blBLQiaa	Highly recommended. You don't want all your neighbours leaching off your internet and you pay the price do you? It can easily be secured by logging onto the admin page. You can find this in the manual, if not try 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 or google it and log in using the credentials user: admin   pass:admin. Once on you can edit the security options to add a WEP/WPA key which can be a word or password of your choice. It is very important as skilled intruders can actually sniff the network for password or more confidential bank information. Use your wits.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Meh.<br>  Secure the wireless.

So your neighbor could be downloading kiddie porn, movies, music, etc. on your internet connection and it would appear to everyone it was you, the owner of the connection.<br>  <br>  If you add encryption to your router, your Tivo will probably just say there's a password required for connectivity, and you enter it once and it will save and never bother you for it again.<br>  <br>  That also goes for your other computers - you should only be asked for the encryption password once, then it's stored.<br>  <br>  Second, if you have shares on your PC that are unsecured, then people accessing your internet connection could also view and run, if not edit and delete, all the files in those shares.<br>  <br>  Get secure!|`|sz8R4jWfaa	Its good to set ur wireless up for protection and with password so no hacker can enter ur computer and steal ur credit card number or bank info.

It is a pain in the rear cause it takes for ever to boot up but it will isolate the problem then you can either fix it or find a way in the forums to shut it off.  Basically the problem is that during the boot up something that it is looking for isn't found during boot up so it needs verification that it is ok to skip that step.  It may be important it may not but there are ways to fix them I just don't know them off the top of my head.

f1tpOEJCaa	to tell you the truth, it would be very wise of you to get a credit card and learn to build a computer, because you could build an amazing gaming system with 1000 bucks, and if you go to the store to buy all this stuff, you will be overpaying, especially if you buy a pre-built computer (such as HP, or Dell or whatever). not to mention the availability of parts and variety is much greater on the internet than in the store.

This hardly ever gets it right. <br>  <br>  If you have bought a laptop or desktop computer from HP for example. The easiest way to update a driver is to go on the manufacturers  website. (in this example <a href="http://www.HP.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.HP.com/)</a> <br>  <br>  Different manufacturer websites categorize the "driver update section" differently. Look for a button named downloads or support. Those are the most common ones.<br>  <br>  You are usually asked to specify which product you have. Sometimes a serialnumber is needed. If this is the case. This Information is usually found underneath the laptop or on the back of the desktop computer.<br>  <br>  the next step is to choose which driver you need. (e.g. graphic card driver, sound card driver, wlan driver, webcam driver etc.)<br>  <br>  download, install an reboot.<br>  <br>  IHowever. If you do have a desktop computer that is really old. You may have difficulties finding the drivers on the manufacturers website. You may have to go to the manufacturer of the specific hardware that needs the driver update. If this is the case. Let me know. And we'll handle that aswell.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZjIvQMQGaa	go to manufacturers site. then search for "Support" or something like this. then search for your model and then download the provided driver. after download is finished just double click on the downloaded file and with out any change just click on "Next" button. <br>  it is possible to search for your model after entering to manufacturer site. then on the page for your device you will find a "Support" or "Driver" page. click on it and choose the latest driver and your operation system and download the driver.|`|bTPvHB4Zaa	example for a dell computer: <br>  <br>  Open internet<br>  go to dell.com<br>  click on: driver download<br>  type in your service tag<br>  download the driver updates you need.<br>  restart your computer|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Real easy, go to the manufacture site of your computer, it will either ask for the model number or serial number and then it will take you to your drivers.|`|WQ0DzpByaa	Start> Settings> Control Panel> System>  Hardware > Device Manager<br>  Right click on the device<br>  Click update driver<br>  Let windows find them for you on the web
901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Chances are your laptop does not meet the requirments for the RAM, processor and graphics card, which is why it is being so loud.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No, it is the nature of the laptops to struggle when playing high end games.  They are really not made for this type of use and cause frequent overheating|`|2xMtNeWiaa	its probably not a good idea to lower the fan. you can possibly change your fan to a quieter fan, but the reason it gets louder is because your computer is working harder, which means it gets hotter, which then means the fan has to pick up speed to keep it cooler. same thing happens for my desktop. there are quiet fans you can get, but for a laptop, i think you might just have to deal with it. there is a way to lower your fan speed, but then you run the risk of your laptop overheating, and thats not good. so look for a silent fan for your laptop or lower your fan speed and put your laptop on a block of dry ice lol gluck|`|ZjIvQMQGaa	this noise is because of your fan that runs faster when you play a game. it works so to cool your CPU more that is processing in full power mode and becoming heated.<br>  if you want that the fan works slower ( your CPU will not work cool ) restart your PC and by pressing appropriate key go to Bios settings. then find the page that corresponds to fan speed settings and find something like "Intelligent fan speed" or "smart fan" and bye changing the settings or disabling force the fan to work slower.|`|NJBp6uJkaa	what is happening is that the components are reaching there max potential, as the voltages required get higher, then the cooling has to increase.  the only real way 2 counter this in a laptop is a laptop cooling pad, but i doubt that they will sevearly dampen anything|`|c6v8veJgaa	The loudness is caused by fans spinning in because your processor and video cards are working harder.  If you make your computer 'less louder' your computer will overheat and shutdown or catch on fire.|`|xOY44zKDaa	The reason your computer gets louder When you play WoW is because of heat reasons. When you play a game like that that uses your graphics card heavily (Like WoW) it generates heat.<br>  To deal with this excess heat, your computer turns on its fans to cool it down.<br>  <br>  There is not a definite way to turn down the fans that won't damage your computer other than getting a liquid cooling system. However, if you make sure your computer has proper ventilation that allows air to flow, and you check inside the computer for dust and other junk, it may make the sound a little less loud.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you,<br>  <br>  max|`|B3HsDsIXaa	well, that sound is the fans working more because your computer is processing faster and getting hotter.  You could open up the laptop and unplug the fans but that would be a very bad idea, unless you enjoy exploding computers.  I would suggest putting in headphones or something to drown out the noise.|`|7j9Hj02caa	Mostly what I saw was all correct but it my just be using alot of RAM and so the computer has to cool down more and turn the fan and cooling system on more but there is nothing to worry about either way. Although you might want to check to see if the heating thing is still clipped to the back where the fan is on the computer.|`|XoA6kByvaa	It is probably increased fan noise.<br>  <br>  There is not much you can do about this.

FBQZ06vraa	First, it's very difficult to determine which processes are supposed to be there and which aren't.  Some processes are obvious, others are not.  Terminating the wrong one can crash the machine.<br>  <br>  Second, if you "terminate" the processes, they'll try to come back up the next restart, but depending on what happened (or didn't happen) when you terminated them, they might not make it.  That can be good or bad.  A safer way to play with startup processes is to use msconfig to keep them from starting on a reboot without actually killing them.<br>  <br>  1. In XP, click on the Start->Run menu item.  In Vista, click the Windows button.<br>  2. In the Run text box, type in msconfig, then press Enter.<br>  3. In MsConfig, click the Startup tab.<br>  4. Uncheck the checkboxes next to the tasks you want to keep from starting.  These won't be deleted from the list, so you can re-check them later on if you want to restore them.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  6. Accept the reboot option.<br>  <br>  After the reboot, you'll get a message about your configuration having changed.  In fact, if you just click OK, you'll get this message after every reboot, however, if you click the checkbox before clicking OK, the message won't come up again unless and until you make another msconfig change.<br>  <br>  Be careful, and good luck.|`|dILqe7nBaa	it sounds like you you have no idea what you are doing so don't do things unless you know what will happen|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	It stops running until you restart the computer.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly.

NJBp6uJkaa	i think taht it is because of the wires in sata allow more electricity to flow through than IDE, so it allows more signal's.|`|4cMuedpWaa	The Serial ATA (SATA) computer bus is a storage-interface for connecting host bus adapters (most commonly integrated into laptop computers and desktop motherboards) to mass storage devices (such as hard disk drives and optical drives).<br>  <br>  Conceptually, SATA is a 'wire replacement' for the older AT Attachment standard (ATA). Serial ATA host-adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable.<br>  <br>  SATA offers several compelling advantages over the older parallel ATA interface: reduced cable-bulk and cost (8 pins vs 40 pins), faster and more efficient data transfer, and the ability to remove or add devices while operating (hot swapping).<br>  <br>  The SATA standard defines a data cable with seven conductors (3 grounds and 4 active data lines in two pairs) and 8 mm wide wafer connectors on each end. SATA cables can have lengths up to 1 m, and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA ribbon cables, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket to up to two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to 45 cm in length by the PATA specification (however, cables up to 90 cm are readily available). Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to air cooling. They are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, but cables can be purchased that have a 'locking' feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.<br>  <br>  Parallel ATA uses single-ended signaling. In this system, noise combines with the data signal during the signal propagation. Noise causes significant interference with the data signal at higher speeds. In order to reduce the interference caused by noise, the driving voltage of Parallel ATA reaches as high as 5 V. Although the higher voltage can overcome the noise to mitigate interference, the 5 V is too high for modern high speed silicon devices. Thus the fabrication cost of signal driver ICs is higher, and the speed is limited in comparison to low voltage silicon ICs.<br>  <br>  In comparison, SATA systems use differential signaling. In this system, the signal does not use an absolute voltage but a difference between two voltages of opposite polarity (one positive, one negative), and it is easy to filter out the noise from the data signal at the receiving end. The higher noise rejection allows the SATA system to use only 500 mV peak-to-peak differential voltage to carry the signal at higher speeds without distortion or noise interference. (An additional side effect of lower signal voltage is lower radiated RF emissions, which means less noise and interference for other circuits both inside and outside the computer and easier compliance with FCC regulations limiting emitted RFI.)<br>  <br>  Compared with the 5 V driving voltage in PATA ribbon cables, the 0.5 V in SATA cables in theory make the SATA system much more power-efficient. However most SATA chipsets need significantly more power than PATA chipsets, due to the faster required encoding per wire. Power usage in signalling is generally proportional to the signalling rate, since faster signalling requires shorter transition times, meaning faster change of voltage levels, and faster voltage change in turn requires higher current. Since all wires have greater than zero resistance, current directly corresponds to power dissipation. Further, silicon technology generally dissipates power mainly when transitioning between voltage states, so a faster rate of state change (more bits per second) dissipates more power as heat. (For the same reason, faster microprocessors produce more heat and require larger fans and heat-sinks.) It is inevitable that a much higher signalling rate would be required to achieve the same data rate with a serial system as with a parallel system, because all of the 16 bits (the number for ATA) plus control bits (register address, read/write selection, etc.) of a transfer cycle have to be sequentially transmitted by the serial system in the same time that the parallel system completes one cycle. In fact, if SATA could and did use the same voltage as (Parallel) ATA, then SATA's power consumption would be much higher than currently.
zorYTX59aa	It's not that easy becoming a YouTube "partner". Almost all of them are either<br>  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.|`|FONse7Ijaa	There is no set requirements for becoming a youtube partner.

It could have problem with a keylogger that was install by someone using the computer. The reason is if Norton was told it was ok for that program to log keystrokes then you would never know.

Firstly you may be experiencing modem overheat problems. If you turn the modem off and then wait a few minutes before turning on and it works this could well be the problem. If this is the case then do not leave the router on 24/7, turn it off while you are not using it.<br>  <br>  Another problem could be a channel conflict with nearby wireless systems. To change this you will need to go into the routers setting and change the channel from auto to a number between 1 and 11. If it is already on a number change it to the other side of the scale eg if it was on 10 set it at 2 and retry. You do not say what router you are using so I cannot give you more specific details.

Then when your done it might(probably will) need to restart to delete some of the viruses. Now if this program does not work, I suggest either the following...<br>  <br>  1. Re-Install Windows XP<br>  2. Do system restore to point where you were not infected<br>  3. Push comes to shove you may need to waste your time on Kaspersky 2009<br>  4.

The results will likely show a non-routable IP address in the 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x range.  When someone else runs the same commands, they are very likely to get the same IP address.  However, they will very likely have a different Internet IP address (which they can determine by going to a site like <a href="http://whatismyip.com)." rel="nofollow">http://whatismyip.com).</a><br>  <br>  Scenario #2:  The Internet connection is shared<br>  Many organizations consolidate their Internet connection to a single location (or default gateway), but still have network access to other sites through leased lines or fiber connectivity.

t5sYXwSqaa	Do you mean that you cannot connect to the router through the ethernet? It is possible to change the routers settings wirelessly, but it can mean you will lose connection permanently. It is much safer to connect through a wired connection particularly when you are trying to connect to change a password. Of course when you change the password or make it password protected you will lose connection until you set the computer up with the new password. How many ports has your router, most have four and some 2 and rarely one, so if one is broken use one of the other ports to connect. Have you tried a different ethernet cable, as it might be this that is at fault.<br>  <br>  I would try all of the wired posibilities before I did anything wirelessly, as if the wired is really broken, and you mess up through wireless, you have no way of resetting the router. I would advice real precaution. <br>  <br>  If you decide to go ahead disconnect your ethernet cable as this maybestopping you from connecting. Hope this helps.|`|C0ctHpPPaa	thats odd it works for me. i always change router settings remotely from a wirelessly connected computer.<br>  <br>  maybe there is some info at the router's manual of company website. try looking for the FAQ section (frequently asked questions)|`|UYTdVcDkaa	I believe your router's IP address as you printed it is incorrect.

g9EnLhaPaa	This is an issue with either your graphics chip, or back light.  I am thinking it is your back light, because it comes on when you close it to a 45 degree angle.  You will have to send it out for repair.  Most PC repair shops don't have the ability for precision soldering.  A fuse probably is coming lose when you open it all the way.  The manufacturer will just solder it back on.  Good luck.
a8eeb508e9838423866dd84a2d141f67aa	This is the basic premise behind it, but it is often more complicated because there isn't just one way to represent signed binary numbers.  The way you gave is known as sign-and-magnitude, but there is also ones' and twos' complement.<br>  <br>  In ones' complement, a negative number is the bitwise NOT of the positive number.  What this means is that the number 0 can be represented as the 8 bit binary number 00000000 AND 11111111.  So in the example you gave:<br>  12 in ones' complement = 00001100<br>  -12 in ones' complement = 11110011<br>  So to get the absolute value of a number in ones' complement, you just flip all the bits.<br>  <br>  Twos' complement, which is the most frequently used binary representation (it is the one used by Intel and is easiest to implement in hardware), is like ones' complement but you subtract one from the bitwise NOT.  So there is only one zero in twos' complement (00000000) and what was -0 in ones' complement (11111111) is now -1.  So following your example:<br>  12 in twos' complement is still 00001100.<br>  -12 in twos' complement becomes 11110100.<br>  <br>  An easy way to find the two's complement of a number is to 1) find the furthest right 1 of the positive number and 2) flip all the bits to the left of (but not including) that 1.  See the example above to see it in practice.|`|AA10401385	it depends.  Generally binary negative numbers are made using the "two's compliment".|`|FBQZ06vraa	That's one way to define signed numbers.  Another ("one's complement") is to flip the value bitwise, like this:<br>  <br>  +1 = 00000001<br>  -1 = 11111110<br>  <br>  +2=00000010<br>  -2=11111101<br>  <br>  and a third ("two's complement") flips the bits, then adds one to the result:<br>  <br>  -1=11111111<br>  -2=11111110<br>  <br>  Confusing , ain't it?  Hope that helps.|`|4d2be0aed2417a75a6cfd26355bbd0a0aa	You'll want to look up "Two's complement". Computing two's complement of a positive number will give you the negative.<br>  <br>  E.g.<br>  0000 1100 = 12<br>  1111 0100 = -12<br>  <br>  Basically, change 0's to 1's then add 0000 0001.<br>  <br>  In signed, 2's complement representation, if you see the left-most bit as a 1, then you know the number is negative. But you cannot just throw a 1 in front of the positive number to get negative with same magnitude (e.g. 0000 1100 = 12, 1000 1100 = -116, 0001 1100 = 28)<br>  <br>  Unsigned integers allows a larger positive max number. Signed integer has a lower positive max, since negative numbers must also be represented.

Plug in your model #, and it will show a list of drivers.  You want to download the setup.exe found under the "network" option on HP's page.  Save the setup.exe (may be a different name) to your cd-rom/jump drive.  Plug that into your HP pc with the Dell version of windows, and move it to your desktop.  Run the .exe.  This should update the drivers.  1394 is a firewire plug (for transferring video from a camcorder and such).

If none of his/her comments show up, then they have made themselves non existing to you.|`|MsH1uOdUaa	If you know he/she was FB friends w/another of your FB friends then go to that friend's page, look & see if you can find that person on their friend list.<br>  <br>  Be aware that your missing FB friend could just de-friend you & have their security settings set so high that you cannot find them at all. If you have their e-mail address, e-mail them & ask what happened to their Facebook page.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for an answer you may not like.
j8G3WkI2aa	You need to learn basic programming first if you want to make a REAL program, not just something using a runtime engine.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Well, first... you'll have to learn a programming language, or you can't do much of anything.|`|0tYtN7xAaa	Gamemaker [Yoyogames.com] FREE, But also upgradable [Made to make games, but can also make other programs!]<br>  <br>  FPS creator [FPScreator.com] $50 [Makes very pro looking FPS games]|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Be more specific, what type of program??? Do you want a command line program or a GUI program. C++ is useful for command line programming, if you want to create a GUI,  such as a window form you can check out Java or C#, both allow you to create GUI's with relative ease. If you are just starting out programming i would suggest starting with C++ and getting a firm foundation in that before you delve into anything else. The reason behind that is you will understand a lot more about how programming works since C++ doesn't "hide"  a lot of the "unsafe" portions of programming like Java and C# does, more specifically pointers and memory addressing in general. Once you have learned C++ you can learn Java and C# in no time since they both borrow heavily from C++ syntax and logic.|`|FGtQPiUiaa	Read some websites or books on beginning programming.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_for_Beginners/Programming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_f...</a><br>  <br>  is a good start.
c3f053e32d1e7ff0710bea42cb07d322aa	If you are the hostER it means to have a "server" computer which holds the files belonging to a website and which serves as the target for anyone on the web who types in the name or address of that website. Think of it the same way you would be if you had company. Your cousins (the files belonging to the website) come into town. They need someplace to stay. You're the host. Their folks need someplace to call them. They tell their folks, they'll be at your house. They give them your number. You're the host.|`|j8G3WkI2aa	It means you run the computer that has all the files, databases, etc, that make up a site.|`|T7Apky52aa	It means that someone has set up a computer to serve the web pages you or others have created. <br>  <br>  Think of a host as similar to a museum. People create things and they want lots of people to see it, but since they can't go around and show everybody they put them in one central location where lots of people can come easily see them. <br>  <br>  That's maybe not the best analogy but hopefully it gets the point across.|`|AA12271834	It means you have full control over the server and web address of the website.  <br>  <br>  If you have a computer (usually a server or desktop) with some web hosting software (Apache is the most common) and a website on the computer, plus you paid an ISP for use of a domain name then you are hosting a website.
