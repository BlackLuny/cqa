There's many ways to show this, but it's pretty well known that the slope of e^x is e^x itself.  Since e^x is 1 in this case, the slope is also 1.<br>  <br>  Question 2<br>  <br>  The slope of the tangent line to the exponential function f(x) = 2^x is some positive number less than 1.<br>  a. True<br>  b. False<br>  <br>  False.  f(x) increases quickly with larger values of x, so the slope can be much greater than 1.<br>  <br>  Question 3<br>  <br>  If f(x) = b^x is an exponential function, then the graph of f passes through the point (0,1).<br>  a. True<br>  b.False<br>  <br>  In other words, is b^0 = 1 for all values of b?  I believe that is True.  The only one I'm iffy on is when b is zero, but I'd still go with True.<br>  <br>  Question 4<br>  <br>  Every exponential function of the form f(x) = b^x crosses the x-axis at (1,0).<br>  a.True<br>  b.False<br>  <br>  Definitely False.<br>  <br>  Question 5<br>  <br>  If f(x) = 2^x , then f(500) is a number larger than the number of atoms in the universe.<br>  a.True<br>  b. False <br>  <br>  Heh heh, I admit I had to look this one up.  2^500 = 3.27339 X 10^150  (From calculator).  According to my internet source there are 4 x 10^78 atoms in the universe.  So True.

This gives you 31h=-8g-12g. Then divide both sides by 31. This gives you an answer of h=(-8g-12g)/31.<br>  <br>  Fourth one, multiply both sides by C. This will get rid of the C in the denominator on the left side of the equation, giving you 3x+4=4C.

Then divide both sides by 5x, giving you an answer of y=(-n-12)/5x.<br>  <br>  **To solve for n, subtract 5xy from both sides, giving you an answer of n=-12+5xy or n=5xy-12 (if you want to switch them around like i do).<br>  <br>  And the sixth one, subtract bc from both sides. This gives you 6y+z-bc=-2y. Then divide both sides by -2 and you get an answer of (6y+z-bc)/-2=y.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and that it makes sense to you. :)

For instance, NaCl will dissolve and form Na+ and Cl-.  Since these particles are charged, they can carry current and conduct electricity.  A non electrolytic solution will not break apart when it is dissolved - sugar, for example.  The structure of a glucose sugar molecule is C6H12O6, a covalent compound.  The covalent bonds will not break, leaving an electrically neutral compound in the water.  Because it has no charge, the compound will not carry a current and conduct electricity.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  -JP

To get into med school, you need to go to college/university and get a bachelors degree first. <br>  <br>  You can major in anything you want, for your bachelors degree, so long as you also do the med school pre-req classes. Your college should have a pre-med advisor on campus, and they'll help you pick the right classes there, so don't worry about that quite yet. <br>  <br>  You can go to any college you'd like, so long as its decent. You do want to go to one of the stronger universities you can get into, and one that fits you well re: personality and location. But you could get into med school from UCLA, or Harvard; from MIT, or UMass Amherst; from Wellesley, or U Florida. You have a very wide variety from which to pick. <br>  <br>  Some colleges that do a very good job of preparing students for med school, and which maybe you want to consider, include Holy Cross, Boston College, Harvard, Spelman, Howard U, Smith College, Mt. Holyoke, UMass Amherst, SUNY Stony Brook... lots of others as well, but those might help get you started. You can also use college search engines like those on www.collegeboard.com to plug in your SATs and etc., and find schools that may fit you.
yn1VHkdLaa	The wording is also not completely accurate.  Joan of Arc was originally charged with several violations of Church laws the most serious being her refusal to submit to the Church Militant.  She abjured on May 24, 1431, but was tricked and forced into resuming to wear male clothes which was what the corrupt Church leaders wanted for justification in pronouncing her a relapsed heretic.  This gave them legal grounds to hand her over to the civil authorities (the English) to be burned at the stake on May 30, 1431.
zZxX5PXBaa	A stanza is what most people call a verse in a poem. Usually it's a regular pattern, every stanza has the same number of lines, 4 or 6, or whatever, but it doesn't have to be the same all the way through; a sonnet sometimes has two stanzas of four lines, and then a stanza of six, for instance.<br>  <br>  Sometimes stanzas are irregular, too.<br>  <br>  A stanza makes the poem easier to read, just like paragraphs in a piece of prose writing. Usually a stanza has a wholeness about it, or keeps thoughts together that belong together, like a paragraph does.<br>  <br>  In writing a poem, a stanza gives you a framework, and a discipline, to force you to be concise. It should help you cut away what's unnecessary, and it can help you judge the pace of a poem.<br>  <br>  Putting yours into stanzas, I would do something like ...<br>  <br>  <br>  It feels like the words are traped inside me, ___________<br>  I thought every puzzle was supposed to have all of its pieces<br>  but it feels like my puzzle is falling apart, and no body can see it.<br>  <br>  The words inside me don’t even make sense<br>  but theyre still struggling to come out.<br>  I choke on my words, and stop myself<br>  <br>  but I really want to just open my mouth and let everything spill out.<br>  I know that I shouldn’t be holding anything back from you,<br>  you were always there for me.<br>  <br>  But this time I just really don’t know how to let my emotions expose.<br>  Its Like a default setting, I shut my mouth and push it to the side.<br>  But everytime I do that, it builds more.<br>  <br>  still I cant get them out. I hide my emotions with nervousness.<br>  There is always more than what I tell you.<br>  I awlways want to tell you more, but I can never get it all out.<br>  <br>  I just want to sit down and just pause time<br>  so that I would have the limit of eternity to tell you everything.<br>  I don’t want to just forget about it, I want to let it all out.<br>  <br>  I just don’t know how.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Having done that, I'd look at it line by line and see how I could make it tighter.

3MbgHvLWaa	The one big difference is that usually continuing education classes are required to be taken and passed periodically after you have received your degree.<br>  <br>  Two excellent examples that I know of are in the Real Estate and Medical fields. In both these areas, even after you have received your degree or license; you are required to take and pass certain classes.<br>  <br>  These are called continuing education classes. They are listed by how classroom hrs. that are required for each class. Also, they are required to keep you updated in your field or degree. Many times certain fields change over time and they require you to take so many classes or classroom hrs. or you will lose your license.<br>  <br>  College credits are usually given for the purpose of of receiving a degree and graduating. These classes can also be measured in classroom hrs. In case you didn't know, when a college student is taking 15 credit hrs. for a semester. This also means that they have 15 hrs. of classroom lecture per week that the class is being offered.<br>  <br>  Now, there are some exceptions to these rules. First, at certain colleges, you can take continuing education classes without having a degree but for the most part; continuing education classes refers to classes that are required to take in order to keep your license. They are in your related field and many times; you may have your choice of classes to take. In other words, you'll be required to pass so many classroom hrs. but you may also be able to choose from a number of different classes in your field. If you want an excellent example, then check for continuing education classes in Real Estate. You should check with your state, since Real Estate is controlled by the individual states.

f0403e22633ac756d1800f187e5b9ab1aa	I can help you with Question 2:  The 1920's were a time period where people began to freely express themselves by going against societal norms.  Girls created the Flapper Era, wearing what were considered short/scandalous clothing.  Cigarettes were also experimented with during this time.  There is a lot more that influenced the 1920's but would take a long time to explain so here is a start.
UwiGwDGdaa	I agree with one other answerer - a more attractive resum will include volunteer work, not extraneous college classes.   Now, what you COULD do is take a class that will apply to your general education credits when you get to college.     The only background a college will care about is quality grades and involvement with the community - basically, what you can offer them as a potential student.   When it comes to classes, if you took a class that would benefit your major field (for example, taking pre-calculus if you plan on studying math in college).     If you really want to know what would impress a college admissions department, call the admissions department of the colleges you have in mind! That's what these departments are there for - helping you. They'll be happy to talk to you about admissions - or - you can check out the website of the future college. They will include admission qualifications there as well.     Good luck.|`|A0wT5sfmaa	As I understand it you want to take an additional course in summer school in order to make your chances of getting into college better?  or   Are you saying you want to take a college class as a sophomore (soon to be junior) in high school?    Either way, I believe it would mean more to a college if you something outside of school with your summer.  Such as volunteer work, or even a summer college program.  This will show you can do other things.  However, if you are dead set on taking a class just make sure you get an A so you can have a good GPA.

ALL words are, duh. In this case it comes from the Latin roots for "first" and "birth." It's the doctrine that the first-born male inherits everything and all the other children are SOL. This abomination stems from Norman law (1066 and all that), based on the idea that there is a succession for the throne, even a minor one. When the landed gentry came about in England as a sort of rural middle class, the law of primogeniture left all but the first-born male disenfranchised and dependent on the good will of the father. The girls depended on a dowry, and the oldest had to be married first, thus institutionalizing parental tyranny. If the eldest male was a wastrel, too bad for everyone else. To placate the second son, the father customarily purchased him a military commission (merit had nothing to do with it, which helped the Revolutionary Colonials). There was little left over for the third son--who too often became a poor country parson. Sons beyond that point had to settle for disreputable occupations like writing or the law.

G5vGTTqhaa	Have you ever been in a class where one student or a group of students dominated the class discussion?    Yes,      What did the instructor do?    The instructor said that everyone should discuss the topic together because everyone is not the same person, everyone has different opinions. Some of you may agree while others disagree all the way.    What should instructors do to ensure that class discussion is fairly distributed throughout or should they at all?    The instructor should ask everyone individually what they think about this topic and what is their opinion. This way if the teacher calls on everyone, everyone can be part of the discussion rather than one student or a group of students.|`|Jg9NOc8Zaa	Sort of.. well if that happens our teachers call other students who do not regularly recite. or sometimes they give graded recitations to ensure that everybody shares their ideas|`|nvsVXlBlaa	Give everyone a chance, and if you feel that the instructor is being unfair tell your daean|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	Allow each student to only answer once or twice and call on students who talk less often.|`|91TQjBGaaa	i know its not nice for some people, but you have to pick on others to answer if they wont. if they are still too shy or dont know, thentalk to them outside of lessons to try and help|`|cHp6EgESaa	Perhaps, order everyone to sit in a circle.  The instructor should maybe go around the class and and ask for everyone to say what they think on the topic.

AA11464317	First, do away with large mega central school buildings that kids have to be bussed to. Instead, have smaller, neighborhood schools. Getting rid of the cost of busing will offset some of the costs. Have kids in school approximately the hours that adults work. Less childcare costs for the parents and kids could get their homework done while at school.<br>  Eliminate the costs associated with superintendents and other bureaucratic overheads and have more teachers that teach in smaller classroom sizes. Make it a law that if a kid wants to drop out of school their only legal option is the military service. Pay kids who graduate $500. Double that to $1000 for Honor Society graduating kids. The cost of that would be offset by fewer sports and extracurricular activities. Have corporate representatives on the school board to help teach what the work force needs so kids can get jobs easier right out of school. How is that for a start?|`|YfMvrdHNaa	The biggest problem I see is a lack of funding and a misuse of funding. Good example is here in colorado springs. We've got schools that make kids share books but we make sure we fund foot ball teams. Cut athletics entirely and make them all city league oriented ie not funded by tax payer dollars. This would free up lots of funds for things like books and teachers. Of course this will never happen. People would rather have 4th grade average reading levels in high school seniors than cut say football.|`|AA10101702	I really liked gandrews answer. It would be nice if schools would simply teach our children like they used to. Now all they see is films teaching them how to use drugs and get a condom at the end of the day giving them permission to have sex. That is not the schools' responsibility. We need a unified federal system, not state by state. We should take a long hard look at Austrailia's school structure.

When I was young ( and the dinosaurs were moving around , my mom baked her bread on occasion and she always made her own biscuits and cornbread . Today we go to the store and get the instant kind and it only takes a short time , but the taste is never the same . I spent 13 years as a US Marine and traveled all over this country and foreign countries . Everywhere I went I carried my mother's recipes and many times folks would say how good it was and could they have the recipe . Of course I was only happy to pass it on to them and I got others from them . Thus the exchange of ideas for good food spread from city to city and country to country . Why even today there is probably some Japanese couple enjoying fried rice ( southern style ) while I enjoy fried rice the Japanese way . ( I still ain't eating any sushi )<br>  So just as people's ideas changed moving from place to place , so did their eating habits and choice of foods .<br>  I hope this helps and answers your question .|`|m16dhfrGaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread.</a><br>  <br>  I'm not sure it is such a good example, as I think it was 'invented' in different places.

Breads are developed to accompany different cultures acquired tastes. For example, naan bread goes with curry, where as pitta bread, which is similar to naan bread just without it's flavour, was made to go with donner kebabs. These food are both from different cultures, which show how each culture has developed the same type of bread to match their everyday meals. <br>  <br>  if you have the time, i'd recommend you watch 'yakitate japan' it's an anime about bread and it demonstrates well the different types of bread within each different culture and how it's developed, as azuma, the main character, develops bread to go with different foods.<br>  <br>   If you don't mind cartoons and have the time, i feel it would be very worthwhile for you. It's also extremely humorous in a lot of parts.|`|pd7WGdl6aa	Hmm, start by thinking about the types of bread you eat. Or start by doing a quick survey of what type of bread is available in a nearby grocery store. <br>  <br>  Is there garlic bread? French bread? Rye? Naan (indian flat bread)? Why is it here? Who eats it? How did people over here start eating so much that it's now commonly available. <br>  <br>  Think about globalization and immigration/emigration, as well as people's needs to expand their horizons to try new things.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)

qX1Mf6Gsaa	The radius is a function of time.  As time passes, the radius gets beggier by the function r(t) = 3t.  After 30 minutes, you have r(30) = 3(30) = 90.<br>  <br>  The area of a circle is found by pi r2.  Now we know that at 30 minutes the radius is 90, so the area is pi 902 = 8100 pi.  <br>  <br>  The area of the circular burn after 30 minutes would be 8100 pi m2.<br>  <br>  that's it! ;)|`|8HhkpFUHaa	In your question, the radius should equal 3 times the time (3t).  If the time is 30 then the radius should be 3 times 30 or 90.  The area of a circle is pi times rsqared.  90 squared is 8100 and pi is a little over 3.  So the answer is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000 m^2.  That answer is nowhere to be found or even close.

In both, the virus gets on a host adn injects its DnA in, uses the DNA and proteins inside the host's body to make more virus parts before splitting the host open (lysing) and letting all the new viruses out to invade more. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus incorporates its DNA with the hosts for a while until its ready to take over and do the lytic cycle.

5Gt3ErYNaa	I think that used to be true, but not so much anymore. Or, it may be true in 20 years. I read that the income disparity between a high school grad and college grad isn't that noticeable until later on. More people than ever are going to college. More college graduates equals more job competition, so yes, for SOME people it means more money, but for some others it doesn't.    I'm a college graduate, and one of the only ones in my family and circle of friends, in fact maybe the only one as of right now. Yet, all of my high school graduate friends are driving newer cars, wearing nicer clothes, and making more money. But they also had a 4-5 year headstart on the money thing. So it takes time for it all to even out.|`|AA10023710	Whenever you're looking at "averages", be aware that just because on average X happens, that doesn't mean it will happen to you. On average, college grads make more than HS grads, but:  1) you might not be that "average" college grad, and   2) your brothers may not be the "average" HS grad.    I mean, if one of your brothers is in an in-demand trade - say he's a master electrician - he probably makes more than the typical college grad does. Likewise, if he graduated from HS ten years ago, and has been working steadily ever since, he may well make more right now than you do fresh out of college.     And as you said, what you make right now, coming out of college, isn't what you'll be making in ten years, or in twenty. Hopefully, over time, your college education will pay off in terms of the salary, responsibility, and/or position you'll be able to achieve. Even if your salary is never higher than that of your brother, hopefully, because of your college degree, you'll end up with a career that you like and that makes you happy.

Discuss the topic in the body, your aim is to persuade the reader to agree with your point of view.    Each paragraph should have a clear topic, expressed in a sentence called the thesis statement.     Some examples of opening sentences :   Speed limits are an internationally recognised method of controlling road behaviour.  Certain areas of society need the protection of speed limits, such as school zones.   Drivers cannot drink and drive, why should they be allowed to drive at speeds which they do not have the skill to manage?  Our roads are not racetracks.     Conclusion - once you have written your arguements out you come back to the original point and review them. So, speed limits are a positive thing for society because...

GiIFr1rjaa	This looks simple:    Parts of Speech    Introduction    "Parts of speech" are the basic types of words that English has. Most grammar books say that there are eight parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions and interjections. We will add one more type: articles.    It is important to be able to recognize and identify the different types of words in English, so that you can understand grammar explanations and use the right word form in the right place.     Here is a brief explanation of what the parts of speech are:    NOUN     A noun is a naming word. It names a person, place, thing, idea, living creature, quality, or action.     Examples:  cowboy, theatre, box, thought, tree, kindness, arrival    VERB     A verb is a word which describes an action (doing something) or a state (being something).     Examples:  walk, talk, think, believe, live, like, want    ADJECTIVE    An adjective is a word that describes a noun. It tells you something about the noun.     Examples:  big, yellow, thin, amazing, beautiful, quick, important    ADVERB    An adverb is a word which usually describes a verb. It tells you how something is done. It may also tell you when or where something happened.     Examples:  slowly, intelligently, well, yesterday, tomorrow, here, everywhere    PRONOUN    A pronoun is used instead of a noun, to avoid repeating the noun.     Examples:  I, you, he, she, it, we, they    CONJUNCTION    A conjunction joins two words, phrases or sentences together.     Examples:  but, so, and, because, or    PREPOSITION     A preposition usually comes before a noun, pronoun or noun phrase. It joins the noun to some other part of the sentence.     Examples:  on, in, by, with, under, through, at    INTERJECTION     An interjection is an unusual kind of word, because it often stands alone. Interjections are words which express emotion or surprise, and they are usually followed by exclamation marks.     Examples:  Ouch!, Hello!, Hurray!, Oh no!, Ha!    ARTICLE     An article is used to introduce a noun.     Examples:  the, a, an|`|AA10418744	The Parts of Speech  Traditional grammar classifies words based on eight parts of speech: the verb, the noun, the pronoun, the adjective, the adverb, the preposition, the conjunction, and the interjection.    Each part of speech explains not what the word is, but how the word is used. In fact, the same word can be a noun in one sentence and a verb or adjective in the next.

The taxes of ordinary working people paid for your loan. You should pay it back.|`|AA12128453	This year, there's pretty much nothing you can do.    There are these forms called w-4's that you fill out when you get a job.  A person lists how many dependants they are claiming.  The more dependants a person claims, the less taxes will be taken out of their paycheck.  Which means at the end of the year, the government will owe that person less money back.  Which means the government is keeping less money to pay back any loans or back child support or any other thing tax returns get garnished for.  Now the problem with that is, if somebody says they have too many dependants and don't pay enough taxes during the year.  That person will owe the IRS money at the end of the year.  If that person doesn't pay that money, they get charged interest and penalties.  If that person still doesn't pay the taxes owed, they start losing property to the IRS.   Now if the IRS finds out a person owes them money because they lied on the W-4 and the person doesn't pay them on time because of it.  That's when you go to court and get fined on top of everything else.    So, if a person can not figure out how many dependants to put on the W-4's so that at the end of the year the amount of money owed to any one (that person or the IRS) is as close to 0 as possible.  And that person is not 100% sure he can pay the IRS any money owed for taxes at the end of the year.  That person should just tell the truth on the W-4's and just suck up the fact he'll not get a tax return until whatever it is is paid off.    I say again.  A defaulted student loan means you don't get taxes back until it's paid off.  Owing the IRS money that you can't pay on time means they'll take your property and garnish your wages.  And if it's because you lied to them, then you're in legal trouble also.  Read this last paragraph until you understand it.

shVgCizBaa	I got this from another answer .It is not from me.////////////////////Othello's language in Act V is inconsistent to what it was in the beginning of the play (Acts I&II) because Othello was a confident & noble man who was passionately in love with his wife Desdemona. However, as the play progresses in Acts III3&IV Othello's language changes as he is manipulated by Iago into believing Desdemona's infidelity. This in turn changes Othello's nature into becoming a jealous wreck and also his language into barbaric and somewhat hell-like, thus being consistent with his language in Act V.     In the beginning of the play, Othello portrays himself to be a noble man with a calm nature. This is evident through his speech (Act I Scene III) to the Duke of Venice regarding Brabantio's accusations of witchcraft toward him. Brabantio allows his negative emotions to affect his judgement, whereas Othello uses poetic and wise language which connotes his calm & rational manner while he explains to the Duke of his & Desdemona's apparent love for one another. It is through his calm and rational manner which persuades the Duke to dismiss Brabantio's accusations. While Brabantio speaks rashly and often very aggressively toward Othello, Othello does not do the same. Instead of lashing back out at Brabantio, his language is seemingly poetic and wise connoting his calm and rational nature. Although stating 'Rude am I in my speech...' Othello presents his humble and calm nature when compared to Brabantio. He knows that he is speaking politely but feels the need to apologise beforehand in case he may offend anyone without knowing. Othello often says wise statements during his speech such as 'unvarnished tale deliver of my whole course of love' when re-telling the audience of how he came to marry Desdemona. He also remarks that his love for Desdemona 'is the only witchcraft' he used. From these wise statements, it is clear that Othello is rational and calm when dealing with confrontation.     Another example is when Othello asks the Duke to allow Desdemona to come to Cyprus with him when she asks to. He states 'I ...beg it not to please ...my appetite...but to be free and bounteous to her mind...' which depicts his noble nature as it is evident that he puts his wife's needs before his own. This indicates his feelings for his wife.    Othello also portrays himself as a husband passionately in love with his wife. During his many speeches through which he proclaims his love, Othello uses strong heavenly imagery to connote his passion and desire for Desdemona. One example of this is Act II Scene I where Othello returns from his battle against the Turks. The two lovers embrace each other and Othello then speaks of his undying love for Desdemona and compares it to the heavens. In stating that his love is 'Olympus-high' Othello implies that his love for Desdemona is immense and infinite. He also speaks of his 'soul's joy' 'comfort' and also that if he was to die then, it would be 'most happy'. From this, it is evident that Othello is extremely fond of his wife and that his relationship with her is a very strong and positive one.    From Acts I&II, it is therefore obvious that Othello's language is inconsistent to what it is in the rest of the play, especially in Act V. His language in these two Acts promoted strong positive connotations in regard to his personality as being noble and calm and also his marriage with Desdemona as being strong. Now as the play continues into Act V, Othello's language changes into crude language with 'hell' imagery giving negative connotation.    In Act III, the transformation of Othello's personality and also his language is obvious. It was mentioned earlier about heavenly imagery used by Othello to depict his stable marriage. However, In Act III Scene III, Othello is no longer confident with his marriage as his language changes from heavenly imagery to hawking imagery. Othello now speaks of his wife as a 'haggard' the image of an untrained hawk to connote his suspicions of her infidelity. It is evident that he now does not think highly of her as he states he will 'whistle her off' meaning he will dispose of her if she does happen to stray away from him. It is evident Othello begins to doubt his marriage in this Act as he allows Iago to manipulate him and believe the lies Iago feeds him. By the end of this Act, Othello's language completely changes as he now speaks in 'hell' imagery which gives negative connotations. He now believes Iago's stories of Desdemona's infidelity although he has no proof. From his change of perspective toward his wife & marriage, his language also changes as he speaks of her in a crude manner like he no longer respects her. This is evident as Othello calls his wife a 'whore' and also when he cries 'Death and damnation!' as Iago suggests Desdemona and Cassio sleeping together. As Othello becomes more confident of his wife's unfaithfulness, his language reflects his fury toward her as he

Put clutter away and get a notice board to pin items on.     Next your going to make two items which will be pinned on the noticeboard. They should motivate and organise you.    1. To do list, as items come in which need to be done you list them on a clearly visible list. When done, you can cross them off.     2. Timetable. Looks a bit like a calender but each day has a large square. You will need to redo this about once a month. Put the day something is due on it and mark with sticker or pen. Then timetable when you plan to do it. This forces you to think about how long until something is due, how much time it will take, etc. Things which are due soon should be highlighted in red while other items can be yellow or green to show that they are not urgent. I found this a great way to allocate my time. It also helped remind me of things to do and motivated me to finish. Its harder to slack off if you can see you have four things to finish. It makes you think.     Other than that, reward yourself for completion of tasks. Tv, chocolate, whatever works for you.

But this book talks about setting goals for yourself, dreaming big and taking the steps to making it happen.    Roger Dawson is a real estate tycoon.  I liked his tapes (and this book) because it's more about getting the most out of your life all around... how to "think" like a successful person does, and why it works.

For whatever reason, their dream doesn't materialize. For some, there may be great disappointment possibly because they cannot cope with the disappointment.    The more mature person will be accepting of the outcome and try to make sense of it. Others will shrug their shoulders and move forward in the hope of something better to come.    The recent plane crash in the Hudson River could be a case in point. The passengers all had a destination in mind when they boarded the aircraft, however, nature in the form of a flight of birds prevented them reaching their goal.    It beggars understanding that everyone was saved; yet no one would complain about the discomfort of not reaching their intended destination.|`|4E2FYEHsaa	It shows that nothing fits together, and the only sense we can find is in the madness of the world!|`|gGNKMqUNaa	this means that when nothing helps your sense can help you|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I think it means something like when you have examined everything and it still does not complete the picture you have got the best possible understanding of things.

The best, longest-agreed-upon definition of what 'sense' IS, are these: hear, see, touch, smell, taste.   Yep, the five senses.   They are what really cause action/reaction, or just being still.   When a person gets older, those senses bring up 'pieces' of memory and can color what they do or don't do.  But:  "When none of the pieces fit..."  ...No matter our age or experience, basic instinct and the five senses kick in--and out go any 'pieces' that don't 'fit.'  That's how we make sense of many new things.  Kind of a "where-there's-smoke-there's-fire" sense.  Very basic.    If you want to go beyond that, it's like watching the Milky Way.   Does a broad band of a galaxy fit in our minds? Not really.   Not even a star fits.   Yet the Milky Way makes sense, because it's seen, on one clear night after another.    Imagination and sometimes knowledge takes us further into understanding something like the Milky Way, on many different levels... few of which 'fit' together.   But it's great to have a sense of it, don't you think?|`|cFFxnXSlaa	"When none of the pieces fit, you make sense of it" = = => when a situation is not clear cut, use your best judgment.

I had the same problem at first feeling like I had little else to do but work. I quickly found that there are an abundance of activities most of which were not available back at home.    Firstly if you of the active persuasion I would suggest taking up one of the martial arts. I have been involved in Kendo for nearly 4 months now and fond it not only a great way to stay in shape but a great way to meet new people and relieve stress.    I would also suggest traveling while you are not working, if you teach English in one specific area see about traveling around and finding new places to teach for awhile. People always love to meet new foreigners and I promise you will find a wealth of new activities everywhere you go.    Overall enjoying yourself here in Japan depends on what sort of new activities you are willing to try and how much you are willing to put yourself out there socially. Meet new friends and maybe do things you may not have had the courage to try back home. I have a group of friends I travel and socialize with all the time who I may not have ahd the courage to approach back home. Keep me posted on your journey and enjoy your time in Japan.    Alex-san

For example, "My car is my girlfriend" and "Hollywood is a cesspool of iniquity." <br>  <br>  Metaphor is used as an informal term for figures of speech in general. You can get really technical with metaphors. I have a book three inches thick naming hundreds of figures of speech, complete with their Latin names and loads of examples. Technically, for instance, the "My car" sentence is personification. And aslso technically, saying "Hollywood" instead of "the culture of Hollywood" is a figure of speech called synecdoche.

AA10176626	They are. Do not send a scam artist your hard-earned money.<br>  <br>  Despite the claims of the crooks who promote "grant kits", "grant guides", "grant clubs", and "grant websites", the US government does not offer ANY grants to individuals for personal financial assistance.<br>  <br>  This means no money for paying bills, no money for fixing up houses, no money for starting up a business, and no money for paying off credit cards or medical expenses.<br>  <br>  The ONLY large scale program of federal grants to individuals are the handful of programs that are part of the federal student aid system. These grants are only available to "exceptionally needy" college students who have been admitted to institutions of higher education. The funds are paid directly to the university or college for the student's benefit, and must be used to pay for tuition, fees and textbooks. The only way to apply for these types of grants is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA.<br>  <br>  The government does provide billions of dollars in grants every year, but the grants are awarded to research institutions, city and state governments, large contractors and schools and universities. A typical grant program would promote research to determine how states can improve the delivery of social services to the homeless, and a typical "winner" of that grant would be a college professor, or a social service agency.<br>  <br>  The federal government has a single website ( <a href="http://grants.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://grants.gov/</a> ), which serves as a gateway to the entire government grant system. If you visit that site, you will find a couple of passages confirming exactly what I'm telling you - and warning people to avoid the kinds of "grant kits" that you are asking about.<br>  <br>  Here's what they have to say: <br>  <br>  "ATTENTION! Grants.gov does not offer money for personal financial assistance or debt. If you are seeking personal financial assistance such as:<br>  <br>  Social Security/Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid or State Social Services, please visit: <a href="http://www.GovBenefits.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.GovBenefits.gov</a><br>  <br>  Student Loans, please visit: <a href="http://www.Studentaid.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.Studentaid.ed.gov</a><br>  <br>  Small Business Start-up Loans, please visit: <a href="http://www.sba.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov</a><br>  <br>  This type of individual assistance is NOT available on this website."<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  "We have all seen them, late night infomercials, websites, and reference guides, advertising "millions in free money" Don't believe the hype! Although there are many grants on Grants.gov, few of them are available to individuals and none of them are available for personal financial assistance. To find an alphabetical listing of federal personal assistance visit USA.gov website's Government Benefits, Grants, and Financial Aid page."<br>  <br>  I hope that information helped you - and discourages you from sending along your money to fraud artists.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA10176626	Blackshell:<br>  <br>  The rules that Congress established to administer the federal student aid system require that the Department of Education verify 30% of all FAFSA applications each year. Those 30% of applications are selected completely at random, and nothing about being selected suggests that your responses are at all out-of-the-ordinary or suspicious.<br>  <br>  When a FAFSA is selected for verification, the Department notifies your school - they are the ones who are actually responsible for doing the verification.<br>  <br>  As you have seen, the financial aid office sends verification-needed applicants a letter, and a specific form, explaining exactly what information on your FAFSA requires verification - and it also tells you what forms of documentation are 'acceptable' for verifying those items.<br>  <br>  Once you have answered the short little questionnaire, and provided copies of your and your parents' W-2s and tax returns, the financial aid office will compare those responses and figures to the information that you entered on your FAFSA form. If the information matches with what you had already provided, your aid offer will remain unchanged - in fact, if the information is a little bit off, but still reasonably accurate, your aid offer will still remain unchanged.<br>  <br>  If the numbers on your documents don't support the numbers on your FAFSA, the aid department will re-evaluate your aid package, and present you with a new offer that is appropriate to the "corrected" information. Students whose documentation indicates that they may have completely fudged the responses they provided on the FAFSA are potentially subject to fines, denial of aid, and possibly jail time. There is a warning on the FAFSA to this effect.<br>  <br>  So - don't be alarmed by being verified - it happens to 3 out of every 10 FAFSA applicants every single year. It could even happen to you again in the future. Complete the paperwork and get it back to the school as quickly as possible - if your documents match your responses, your school will simply sign off on your aid, and there won't be any delay. If the documents provide a different picture of your financial circumstances, a delay is possible, while the school recalculates your aid eligibility.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope that helped.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	"Verification" means checking to see if something is accurate.  It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with how much aid you'll receive.  It sounds like they're just auditing your paperwork at random to make sure everything you put down was true.

An essay can be paper you already wrote for high school, or it can be about something personal in your life. My daughter wrote about being in the peer tutoring program at school, her friend wrote about her travels with her family. <br>  You will need to got four years and get a Bachelor degree.

W55tjTcbaa	i'm sure you can but look into colleges and then look into where that 2 year will transfer to and what you can get a degree in at the 4yr college with those transfered credits.  The 2 yr college will be able to tell you where you can transfer to and for what degrees.|`|AA10023710	You can, absolutely, so long as the college you study design at is regionally accredited. So long as it is, your credits will be eligible to transfer. <br>  <br>  When you transfer, you don't have to pursue the same major you did for your associates degree. But studying a different subject may put you behind a bit. For example, if you study fashion design for your associates, and then transfer to a university for your bachelors in fashion merchandising, you may have to take the lower-level fashion merchandising classes that the other students took in their first years. But I actually think you'll be in pretty good shape, because at least some of the early classes for fashion design are the same as for fashion merchandising. You'll have some overlap, so it's not like you'll have to go back to year one! And the classes you took like English, math, history, will all transfer, so that'll help as well. It's just the few courses in your major - fashion merchandising - that you may have to play catch-up on. <br>  <br>  The Fashion Institute of Technology, which is one of the best design schools in the US, has a 2+2 program. You do your first two years, an associates degree, and then you go on for your bachelors at the same school. It's worth considering.|`|tcVmieJgaa	some schools offer short courses on fashion design. If you want to get a nice job after, have yourself enrolled in an exclusive and expensive school. I think it is much better to study 4-year college program first then proceed to other courses after graduation. it would just take you 2-3 years per course.

First if I had a horse, then we'd have to deal with the issue as to whether or not the horse I had was the one he was claiming, and if it was, whether or not I had possession of it which I was not entitled to have.    If I didn't have a horse, but I knew of somebody named Charley, we might have some issues to deal with.    If I had no horse, and didn't know of any Charley, I'd ask him who he thought I was ... possibly he might have confused me with someone else ... or might even be in the wrong house.    Actually I had a situation like that happen many years ago.  I was visiting someone I had just recently become acquainted with and I was sitting in his living room drinking a beer.  I heard an argument in another room, and someone stormed in and shouted at me "What about you?"    I looked up and asked, "What do you mean?", and this guy hit me, broke my nose and left.

You're a strong student and you obviously have a focus, but Brown generally takes people in the top 1-3% of their class....you probably need about 3.7+ to get in. NYU isn't as strict, but they still look for top 10%. See how you do in the next few years. I hear U-Texas Austin has a great journalism program, so you should definately look into that.    Try plugging your scores into this calculator:  http://www.campuscompare.com/chances    It will tell you the odds of getting in at your top-choices.    Good Luck!|`|UxooffHZaa	College is more about fit than it is about which university is better. For me, I wanted a smaller State university, so I went to Clarion.

mTwn8p79aa	You need to know what test the school accepts.  Most schools don't accept both tests.  If you sent them the SAT and they only accept ACT scores then you've wasted your time applying to that school, it'll be just like an application without any test score.  If they accept either test, which most schools don't, then you're fine.

dsogAKkgaa	That first answer is fine and detailed and science-oriented. Here's a more general explanation.<br>  <br>  Spectrum is used of the complete range of variation of something that can change, from one end to the other. <br>  <br>  Usually this implies that the range is continuous--changes smoothly from one end to the other, no breaks. You can go smoothly from uncertainty to certainty with unconvinced, skepticism, doubt and benefit of the doubt somewhere in the middle, for instance. Or the temperature of a pot of water can vary smoothly from freezing to boiling.<br>  <br>  Somewhat metaphorically you can say spectrum when the changes from one end to the other are discrete (the museum features the whole spectrum of Fords, from the Model T to experimental concept cars), and when the variation is in more than one direction. For example you can refer to the "whole spectrum of human emotion," which has wide variations in many characteristics, and you can't always go smoothly from one emotion to another.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	a broad range of related objects or values or qualities or ideas or activities|`|eEzvuzu0aa	2. (Opt.)<br>     (a) The several colored and other rays of which light is composed, separated by the refraction of a prism or other means, and observed or studied either as spread out on a screen, by direct vision, by photography, or otherwise. See Illust. of Light, and Spectroscope.<br>     (b) A luminous appearance, or an image seen after the eye has been exposed to an intense light or a strongly illuminated object. When the object is colored, the image appears of the complementary color, as a green image seen after viewing a red wafer lying on white paper. Called also ocular spectrum.<br>  <br>  Absorption spectrum, the spectrum of light which has passed through a medium capable of absorbing a portion of the rays. It is characterized by dark spaces, bands, or lines.<br>  <br>  Chemical spectrum, a spectrum of rays considered solely with reference to their chemical effects, as in photography. These, in the usual photogrophic methods, have their maximum influence at and beyond the violet rays, but are not limited to this region.<br>  <br>  Chromatic spectrum, the visible colored rays of the solar spectrum, exhibiting the seven principal colors in their order, and covering the central and larger portion of the space of the whole spectrum.<br>  <br>  Continous spectrum, a spectrum not broken by bands or lines, but having the colors shaded into each other continously, as that from an incandescent solid or liquid, or a gas under high pressure.<br>  <br>  Diffraction spectrum, a spectrum produced by diffraction, as by a grating.<br>  <br>  Gaseous spectrum, the spectrum of an incandesoent gas or vapor, under moderate, or especially under very low, pressure.

See Spectrum, 2 (b), above.<br>  <br>  Prismatic spectrum, a spectrum produced by means of a prism.<br>  <br>  Solar spectrum, the spectrum of solar light, especially as thrown upon a screen in a darkened room. It is characterized by numerous dark lines called Fraunhofer lines.<br>  <br>  Spectrum analysis, chemical analysis effected by comparison of the different relative positions and qualities of the fixed lines of spectra produced by flames in which different substances are burned or evaporated, each substance having its own characteristic system of lines.<br>  <br>  Thermal spectrum, a spectrum of rays considered solely with reference to their heating effect, especially of those rays which produce no luminous phenomena.

He has 500 men under him. He is cutting the grass at the cemetery.    There was a washing machine in the new house when we moved in, but it wasn't working too good. Last week I put 14 shirts into it, pulled the chain, and I haven't seen the shirts since.    Your sister Mary had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether it is a boy or girl, so I don't know whether you're an aunt or uncle.    Your Uncle Dick drowned last week in a vat of whiskey in a Dublin brewery. Some of his workmates dived in to save him, but he fought them off bravely. We cremated his body, and it took three days to put out the fire.    Your father didn't have much to drink at Christmas. I put a bottle of castor oil in his pint of beer. That kept him going till New Years day.    I went to the doctor on Thursday and your father came with me. The doctor put a small tube into my mouth and told me not to open it for ten minutes. Your father offered to buy it from him.    It only rained twice last week. First for 3 days, and then for 4 days. Monday it was so windy that one of our chickens laid the same egg four times.    We had a letter yesterday from the undertaker.

The fact is that evolution has occurred and is occurring.  It is confirmed by the fossil record, genetics, observation, experimentation, and every other field of science in a position to do so.  It is accepted by 99.9% of scientists.  Whether or not evolution occurs has not been debated in science for more than 100 years - it's quite obvious it does, and telling kids otherwise is quite frankly just lying to them.  Not teaching it leaves out the vast majority of biological science.  Evolution is testable, predictable, repeatable, and falsifiable - the hallmarks of science.  Creationism is none of these things, and thus is not science and will not be taught as such.|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	Can I ask a counter question:<br>  - which do you think should be taught in science classes in schools: [1] a curriculum defined by what current science understands about the laws of the universe, or [2] only the parts of current science which agree with a literal interpretation of the Old Testament?<br>  If you say [1], then evolution must be taught in science classes in schools.<br>  If you say [2], then you have to not teach any science that has been developed since the end of the 1700s. This would include modern geology, astronomy, cosmology, physics, and biology (since all of these fields contradict the OT, literally interpreted).<br>  <br>  And if you wish to "teach the controversy", I have to point out that there ISN'T ONE! 99.85% of the scientific community accept evolution as true, and reject creationism as a possibility.|`|UxooffHZaa	Evolution is Science. Science is not only a requirement for school, but central to one's education. So many scientific ideas are built off Evolution that you have to understand it to get to higher scientific concepts. You don't have to accept it, just like you could tell the teacher the sky isn't blue, and that's fine, but for the test, answer that the sky is indeed blue, even though we all know it's actually liver red. Don't use your religion as an excuse to be lazy though. Disbelieve it, but learn it and get good grades.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	I think you have your answer. Schools shouldn't be teaching religious doctrine. Why stop at the conservative Christian point of view? There are many other religions with other legitimate beliefs on creation as Christianity, why force your opinion on others?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Like anything else (ex. The Big Bang "Theory") it should be taught, but as theory.  The teachers can say that "some scientists believe", instead of saying, "Evolution has been proven as fact".|`|AA11606721	It seems that you're not only a Christian but one who believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible. This means that you probably also have a problem with teaching geology in schools, and physics, and chemistry, the scientific method, and skeptical inquiry - they ALL point to an ancient earth, a non-religious cosmology, scientifically verifiable evidence that shows a literal reading of parts of the Bible is not correct, etc.<br>  <br>  Where will you draw the line? Do you want ANY science taught in schools?<br>  <br>  Teaching creationism is fine but not as a science, and because we are a world of many religions, we'll need to include the creation stories from ALL religions - just like we need to teach ALL science.|`|AA11993919	Well, personally, I think homeschooling is the best way, so kids don't have to hear all this trash in our schools. But, I know that is not an option sometimes. If they do teach evolution and creation, they should teach both as a theory, because they both take faith to believe. They should let the students know that their is not a shred a evidence for evolution, but plenty for creation. They should let them know how evolutionists misinterpret facts to explain away creation. I could list a whole bunch more, but you get the idea.|`|tVOzjukaaa	Schools should avoid trapping their students by teaching only one perspective. They should offer multiple explanations and let students use their own good judgment to decide.<br>  <br>  Evolution and creationism are not mutually exclusive, nor are they the only possible explanations of the universe. <br>  <br>  Teaching students to think is more important than teaching them dogma, whether that dogma comes from the Bible or a science textbook.<br>  <br>  Knowledge is finite, but ignorance is infinite. Those claiming to "know" anything as "fact" without question are the real liars.|`|dl2Km3W7aa	Evolution is a legitimate theory and should be taught in schools as a legitimate theory. Religion and solely religious ideas, such as Creationism, have no place in public schools.|`|FXzjL3ngaa	Well, people who want a specific religious background in their teachings better go to a christian school.

eI9mkxS5aa	When the firm is extracting info about the applicant it's easier to do it off the forms. 1- because it only asks about what the company actually wants to know 2- the field and questions were organized by the firm making it more "valid" since in a CV someone might manipulate words.. in example a TV and movie fan might write on their CV " A Professional production critique".<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|oBjQXtxCaa	First part - If you are offered an employment that may be dangerous, you may try to sue.  The firm will want to know that the applicants fits the full requirements of the job offered.  At first appearances may seem correct but if the job is found to be too difficult for you who will YOU blame?<br>  <br>  Second part - A CV can be falsely dreamd up with exaggerations or suspect problems left out.  The employer will submit a questionnaire, to see that you can explain yourself in writing.  That you can read, write and spell neatly.  Also the employer will know what questions he/she needs to ask you in relation to the position in question being offered.  There is also one other sinister possible reason.  The employer may submit your writing to a 'writing expert' to see if your personality is compatible with the company...
KSGPRID7aa	First you shouldn't clutter yourself into studying for long periods of time without taking some kind of a break...i've found that this will just block out completely what you are trying to learn; find a good spot to study without any distractions, stearing away from that spot during your breaks. <br>  <br>  Highlight area's in your reading that you feel you could come back to, for example in your History; highlight the year and the MAIN EVENT that year; making an OUTLINE of your reading...and if it helps jot down the time line on a seperate sheet of paper. This should help recap what you have read and highlight specific dates with events. Hope this helps....?|`|12VQ4ETcaa	I love history!  I think the reason it bores most people is because they can't imagine what it was like to be those people or live at that time.<br>  <br>  What used to help me memorize dates was to imagine one of the figures, say George Washington, at whatever age he would have been when something happened.<br>  <br>  The other thing that helps is just to write down what you need to learn, and then read it over and over again.<br>  <br>  Hide anything that's distracting you.

a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Yes, usually you can transfer after one year, but it will depend on the number of credits you have completed.  For example, at UNLV I only had to have a minimum of 12 credits to transfer, so I could transfer there after one semester, but at another college it was a minimum of 24 so it took a year.  At a third college (which I never did attend) it was a minimum of 60 or two years.  Look at the requirements for the college(s) you want to attend and find out the minimum needed for transfer students.  Then finish out that amount and transfer.  Yes, your credits, as long as there is a transfer agreement between the community college and the university, will transfer.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You can transfer after one semester if the new college will accept you.<br>  <br>  If the community college is accredited, then any credits earned will be transferable to a four year institution, provided the coursework is similar to what is required at the larger institution.  Otherwise, it does no good to bother transferring the credits.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Yes you can. If you transfer with less than 60 credit hours most colleges are going to want your high school transcript and your ACT/SAT score along with your CC transcript. <br>  <br>  Most CC credit doesn't transfer, but sometimes it only counts as an elective or sometimes it doesn't transfer at all. Sometimes you have better luck transferring to a college -in the same state<br>  <br>  My son went to CC in IL and transferred to a four year college in TN and all credits were accepted.|`|d5mzu3fKaa	The easiest thing to do is to transfer after 2 years when you get your associates, so pretty much all your credits will transfer over. A bunch of my friends transfered after one or two semesters at our Community College, and all of their credits were accepted. I'm lucky that our community college is one of the best in the country, our school has the hook up to a bunch of Universities so its really easy. I would go for it, I've saved tonsss of money doing my two years. :)|`|XGPML3Lsaa	you can transfer at anytime.  Usually colleges accept credits from classes ur get a C or better in but each school has its own policy.  Check with the school you want to transfer to.

wLZpEiX8aa	I'll try to be helpful.  I found finding graphs and charts difficult.  You may have luck if you type "skin cancer statistics graphs charts" into the search bar. Also try "sunlight skin cancer risk" as a google search.<br>  <br>  I would say that you can sum up the pro's and cons like this: <br>  <br>  pro's: <br>  <br>  15 minutes a day is adequate for vitamin D production.  <br>  Some sunlight may prevent "seasonal affective disorder" in those who are susceptible.  <br>  People are often taking part in healthy activities and exercise when they are outdoors. <br>  <br>  cons: <br>  <br>  Excessive sun exposure is directly related to the incidence of skin cancer. Cumulative sun exposure increases the risk of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, the two less serious forms.  Melanoma risk is more complex.  Genetic factors, as well as severe sunburns before the age of 18 increase the risks.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't come to a conclusion except the obvious.  Exposure to UV sunlight is related to skin cancer risk. It is  inadvisable to never go outside.   Using a high number sunscreen may provide some protection. <br>  <br>  Here are some links: <br>  <br>  The national melanoma institute:<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/melanoma" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types...</a><br>  <br>  Some basic information on the risks, statistics of skin cancer<br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/skincancer/stats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/skincancer/stats.htm</a><br>  <br>  This link has links to the statistics on different types of skin cancer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/skincancer/stats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/skincancer/stats.htm</a> <br>  <br>  This link has some tables on skin cancer incidence in the UK:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://organizedwisdom.com/helpbar/index.html?return=http://organizedwisdom.com/Skin_Cancer_Charts_and_Graphs&url=info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/mortality/" rel="nofollow">http://organizedwisdom.com/helpbar/index...</a><br>  <br>  Last, this is a very good link, though the site is a little difficult to navigate.

Two of the nouns are Proper Nouns (Bob and Jill).<br>  <br>  'his girlfriend' could be described in various ways, depending on what sort of grammar you're into. Some would simply call it a 'qualifier' .. .in this case it qualifies Jill. Some would call it an 'adjectival phrase', since it's just adding a bit of information to a noun, which is what an adjective does.<br>  <br>  In the second version, the subject is 'his girlfriend', and 'Jill' is the qualifier.<br>  <br>  There's a very slight difference of emphasis between the two, between Jill as a person, who happens to be Bob's girlfriend, and on other hand, Bob's girlfriend, who happens to be someone called Jill.|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	3

p9Ku6RKOaa	Im sophomore in college right now and double majoring is the new "requirement". It used to be just going to college was a must and now you need 2 majors. Having 2 majors is a great career choice because it gives you multiple options after school and it sets you apart from the rest of the pack. Plus, you have plenty of time to decide what you want to do.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Many students double major now with a minor. Can you still get done in four years. Are you willing to take 16/18 credit hours per semester. You need to know what you can handle.|`|AA11942204	Good question. In general, I counsel students away from double majors. The reason is that they leave you virtually no room in your program to study anything else, i.e. they give you no flexibility. On the other hand I really like the idea of a Major and a Minor which are very different from each other. If you are good at math you might think about an Economics Major and a Music Minor. The Economics Major is a more foundational degree than accounting or business but would be ideal if you want to go on to an MBA degree. Maybe work in the music business?<br>  <br>  Good luck.
AEPBiiXiaa	w3 tutorial-<a href="http://w3schooling.info" rel="nofollow">http://w3schooling.info</a>|`|34VXCyvVaa	Law school is considerably more work with tons of reading and class preparation.  In some classes, your entire grade is based on the final exam.  The professors also make a point of calling on students to explain the basics and fine points of particular cases, so you always have to be prepared ahead of time.  You can't just cram for an exam, because you actually have to know this stuff for your career, so you truly have to learn it.  Law school, like med school, requires good time management and personal discipline.|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	It is nothing like undergraduate school. <br>  <br>  Your days will consist of nothing more than you sitting in a law library and that chair will slowly become your new best friend. You are going to being spending countless, hours, days and weeks in there simply preparing cases and briefs your next classes. Once in class the professor may or may not call your name, and if they do, then you better hope you are prepared well and know case inside and out and are well versed on your side of the argument or issue in question. If you are unprepared then it is going to be the worst 20-30 minutes of your life, and lest not mention that you may get a professor from hell, who take you down a letter grade for not being ready. <br>  <br>  I suggest you read up on the Socratic method if you do not know what this is already, because you will get professors who teach via this.<br>  <br>  There are no mid-terms. Your general day will be: Wake up, work on your class work, attend lectures, then continue working on your class work. If you are lucky, you may fit some sleep in there, that is if you can after all of the stimulation and caffeine in your system.<br>  <br>  You're who grade is generally based off of one final exam.<br>  <br>  The fun to be had.|`|Spr3E5FWaa	Grades:  Entire grade is usually based on one exam at the end of the semester.  Not an undergrad exam.  The essay portion will just be a set of facts and you have to apply the law you learned the entire semester.  The best way to get points is not being right (this person should win) but instead by spotting all of the legal issues presented and analyzing them.<br>  <br>  Some upper level classes will have a paper instead of a final.  The paper is usually required to be at least 25 pages and is a much more submersive project than undergraduate writing.<br>  <br>  Class: NO LECTURES.  There are not lectures in law school.  You read about 40 pages per class (about 400 a week total) and go to class.  Your professor will then call on students and random and drill them with questions about that days assignment.<br>  <br>  It is WAY more difficult than undergrad.  This is a graduate program, and a difficult one at that.  It requires a LOT of self discipline to force yourself to do homework for about 50-60 hours a week PLUS making it to every class as you usually only get around 2-4 absences before being booted.  <br>  <br>  I got through undergrad with barely even cracking a book.  this is just impossible in law school.  It is a BIG lifestyle change from undergrad.
AA11865147	Visual aids and hand-outs help.  Can you turn a part of your presentation into a game the room can all participate in?  <br>  Enlisting others to act out a drama which makes your point is often effective.  <br>  Also, you can often get local businesses to donate 'favors' which relate to your presentation, especially if you are promoting an idea for the good of the community.  They might be bumper stickers or calendars or posters.<br>  And if you can get a 'professional' to attend your class and support your presentation it is a big plus.

nxEoR9CEaa	In my opinion, the supply and demand model is outdated.  For example:  The demand for grain is high.  The US is more than capable of producing more, but farmers are paid to destroy crops, or not plant in order to maintain a market price in this so called"Global Economy".  Demand is lower now for oil, supply is up, but the price at the pump is not decreasing with the cost per barrel of oil.  Cars are more plastic and fiberglass than they are steel.  Much cheaper products.  So why is the cost so much higher?  Seems to me that if the price were lowered to reflect the cost of production, instead of the auto makers trying to make a killing off just one vehicle, they could sell more making more sales and profits.  The basics of economics have been tossed out the window.|`|3ymRScIuaa	Also, increasing population.

LwywrSRkaa	What year are you in, year 10 or 11? Even when I was in year 10 round December I had a chance to swap schools where I was on a waiting list for 2 years but I rejected it simply because I wasn't sure whether they'd have the same subjects as I did in my current school. Whatever your story do remember that exam boards, subjects and so on could be VERY different to your own school. If you already started doing exams in year 10 then it's a bad idea to change. Do remember it is your future. So find out about the school first and what they offer. If you're in year 11 I would say no, STAY!

RAxSichXaa	By any chance does the drawing show that the cables are attached to the chandelier at an angle other than 90 degrees?  For example, let's say that the cables are attached such that the angle between the cables and the chandelier was 60 degrees and the cable is the hypotenuse of a triangle formed by the horizontal chandelier and a vertical line from the ceiling to the chandelier.  Then the VERTICAL COMPONENT of the tension in the cable is 91.47 N, but the tension in the cable is actually 91.47/sin60 deg =105.62 N<br>  <br>  This is only an example, does this help?

I understand that these are the sorts of subjects people look for in new employees. It's also good that you're doing a foreign language. If you are in a company which have customers abroad, you'll be great because you will be able to translate for the company to the German community. You can't really go wrong with GCSE's because a company doesn't really look at them - they're more interested in A levels. But you still should do well in them. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to make sure these subjects are the ones YOU enjoy. There's no point taking a subject that you absaloutley hate because you won't put in 100% effort into that subject.<br>  <br>  Art and history seem to have a lot of work, I don't personally do them but my friend does and she's contantly working.

Now, I think I know what your trying to get at it, if you don't go to college you won't learn as much, you won't get as high-end of a job, yadda yadda as if you had went and got credentials. In some cases this is true, many high-end jobs require that you have certain credentials. However, you don't need to be in a high-end job to keep your math skills and going to college or some other place of learning won't guarantee you keep your math skills, just like getting a job after your diploma might guarantee them.

I didn't go to college for a couple years or so and now that I'm back in school I'm feeling quite inadequate. I had to start all over in math 950, which in my school is the equivalent of a high school pre-algebra class. I've had chats with several other students in my classes that have done the same. They were MUCH higher in mathematical skill level before college and now they have rescinded greatly. Some schools are aware of this fallback and if you go for a certain period of time without taking any math, you will have to retake a placement test to make sure you are still capable and if you're not, then you're paying for classes you already took. Best not to leave any time (or at least very little time) between math courses.|`|g8DqsThiaa	False. If you've payed attention in class mostly through all12 grades then you probably wont. Also because in life you come across things where you need to use math so you'll remember it all then. But on the other hand, everything you ever learn can't be with you all the time so at one point you'll lose some facts along the way but you will never go back to kindergarden level.|`|2k6WGszKaa	Well, it depends.

LwywrSRkaa	Hi! Here are some study tips for you as well as exam ones.<br>  <br>  To start of you can make a revision schedule. Whatever you make don't plan it for a long period of time but perhaps for a week. Some people find it's better to concentrate on one subject and others find it's better to do different ones so they don't get bored. You should do about 10-30 minutes a session (and then change the subject for the next session) and then take a break. You should at least spend 2/3 hours a day. Leave one day to give yourself a rest though. (This is for exams only, when you are just normal studying just spend an hour a day or something.)<br>  <br>  Prepare beforehand, make check lists of things you already know and things you don't, or what you need help with and so on.<br>  <br>  When you make a revision timetable don't make it too hard either cos you might not stick to it. Make it nice and simple so you can stick to it. As you feel more comfortable with whatever you planned you can increase the difficulty.<br>  <br>  You will also need to find your own revision methods, I like making notes, doing podcasts, posters, flash cards etc. find out what works best for you. Make it look interesting though; not boring but colourful and attractive so you will be more motivated. Ask friends or family to test you too. I find what works for me, is to get my revision books get to the pages I need to revise take a whole bunch of plain paper. I learn a page then I scribble down everything I remember.<br>  <br>  Also when you go home from school you can note down what you have done and try making useful notes during lesson times. Just pay attention a lot and ask your teachers if you don't understand things.<br>  <br>  Start early and you don't have to do intensive revision every day but it is helpful to look through small notes to remind yourself. Best way to get confident in exams is to do a lot of practice papers, so you get used to the style and know what sort of things to expect. =)<br>  <br>  I find I can study better in the morning than in the evening. =) Working without distraction helps too!<br>  <br>  Of course don't do it excessively, have fun now and then as well. Little treats and rewards help as well. ;) Good luck! =|`|11NSsAN7aa	Just try you hardest. Get lots of sleep, study hard before tests, and don't hurry to finish your homework so you can watch your TV show! Ask for help if you need it and you will be fine.

You dont have to go over everything everyday! Just enough to keep it all fresh on your mind. Sometimes if you wait until you only have a few days to study before the test, you tend to forget stuff easily and make silly mistakes.<br>  <br>  Just try to make a little more room for reviewing school material outside of school..and yes, i know some people just hate the idea of spending more time that it it actually required on school stuff... if you find this hard, just think of what your mom promised you, that might give you the patience to keep at it ;-)  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope find a way to make thing work!!|`|FYR9nQjdaa	You can't just go from a C or B student to a straight A student. Two years ago in 8th grade I got straight F's in the first quarter. I got tired of looking like an idiot so I started to put in the effort, do every homework and study for exams. I only went up to straight C's. then my mom told me "that's ok, you can't jump from F to A, it takes time". Now I'm in 10th grade and I almost made it.

Also, if you are having trouble with something, go to that teacher the same day, or class, and ask as many questions as possible. Study the notes and what you learned when you get home, then do your homework. Use the textbook for bio and chem if you are stuck and still don't get it after you talk to a teacher.  Geometry the way i was good at it, is to just practice from your notes until you get it.  good luck|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Depends on what you are doing in those 3 classes that you are not doing in the other 5. Otherwise, pay attention to your teachers in class and take notes. When you get home do your homework first. If you have a reading assignment, take notes from that. If you don't have a test the next day go over all of your notes. If you do have a test then study your notes and the topics in the textbook. There are many resources online that provide tips to taking notes and to studying. If you have any projects for that grading period get started on them early so you'll have plenty of time to invest in it and to finish it.

7d023a65fe2a7fb214b1f3e00dafbd9faa	The guitar is a member of the lute family of instruments. The first guitar to be recognized was used somewhere about the 1st century CE in Mesopotamia.    Originally guitar strings (like other musical instrument strings) were fashioned from animal gut and probably made somewhere in that part of the world.   Modern guitar strings are made of steel, nylon and an assortment of other polymers.  In 1953 Amelio Vinci revolutionized the music industry when he invented the first automated string-winding machine, which enhanced winding accuracy and created strings that deliver the truest sound possible.

juqGUHIcaa	You need to split the number within the radical up into all of its roots. You can do this in a tree, or as I do it below:  40 = 2 * 20  20 = 2 * 10  10 = 5 * 2    In each of those steps, take out the number that cannot be reduced into smaller numbers. Here, we get three 2's and a 5. Multiply those together and we get 40.    With the roots 2, 2, 2, and 5, we group them into like pairs. We have a pair of 2, but nothing more (leaving us with another 2 and the 5).  It looks to me like you got this far, but you've put the numbers in the wrong place. Instead, you take the like pairs and put them outside of the radicals:  2(5 * 2), or 210.

To check, -5 + 2 = -3, so 4^-3 = 1/64.  -5 - 1 = -6, so 2^-6 = 1/64.

Read this:  http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos069.htm    The traditional route to becoming a public school teacher involves completing a bachelors degree from a teacher education program and then obtaining a license. However, most States now offer alternative routes to licensure for those who have a college degree in other fields. Private school teachers do not have to be licensed but still need a bachelors degree. A bachelors degree may not be needed by preschool teachers and vocational education teachers, who need experience in their field rather than a specific degree.

There's usually only one to a school or maybe two if it's high school. K-12 would give you more latitude. There are other ways to teach art and today in this bad economic atmosphere, you will need to be more creative with this. Teaching home schooled kids is one way. Private schools another and Saturday classes another. Summer classes are always needed - and this is how we will teach in the future, if not now. We can't let art fall by the wayside just because some legislators said kids had to pass some pencil and paper test which resulted in art, music and other electives being pulled from the program. These are now replaced by REMEDIAL test taking.   So that is the reality of it. It's a little tougher out there to get the art job but you can still do it and be very successful. Think "goal" here - how about your very own art school that you run? If you really want to teach, then you will do it no matter what the situation.   YOu may want to have a second certification - maybe elementary classroom? Then you could integrate art with all the subjects that kids have too- every art teacher's dream!   So to answer your question - yes, major in K-12 art education. But take a second certification as a backup. Use your art wherever you can.   And academic advisors have never been art teachers.

You are not legally allowed to teach other subjects. The only subject you could be hired for is Visual Arts. With NCLB school districts are required to notify parents if an unqualified teacher was teaching a subject out of his/her area of certification, you'd fall in that area. You could short term sub in any subject K-12. I'd suggest getting a dual major with the second one being in a high demand area like math, science, or special education. I retired from teaching Art for 30 years, I now sub when I want, if I want, in most any subject. I taught a 1st grade last week.

Do you mean allow schools to force students to pray?  No, that's a clear violation of the first amendment.  You can't make people pray to any god, much less a specific one.

That is why America is so beautiful. A child is allowed to prayed to themselves but if cannot be mandated.  It should stay that way.  This is the land of freedom of religion.  Imagine if you were a Christian living in an Islamic country where you were forced to pray 5 times a day to Allah while kneeling on a rug.  That wouldn't be right to you because that is not how your religion operates.  By keeping mandated prayer out of school we keep it comfortable and open to children of all religions and beliefs.

Many of the medical students I know can barely put together a sentence in ENGLISH! Moreover, there are hardly any schools or colleges that teach Latin. Even private tutoring is hard to find. However, it is possible that you know someone who got his/her medical degree 40 or 50 years ago. At that time, Latin was routinely taught in most schools. Many medical terms are really Latin words, even now. But much has changed, over 50 years. Much of the medical research and technology that exists today did not exist 50 years ago. And so, many of the Latin terms have disappeared. For example, there is no Latin term for an MRI or for AIDS.    Bottom line: You don't need to learn Latin. However, the more you know the better you will be at whatever you do.|`|AyPOc8WNaa	I haven't really heard of any public schools offering latin.  It's just not used hardly anymore.

63DaqBtXaa	I will definitely do it. 38 years old is not too late for school, but it will be really difficult when you get to mid 40s. Do it when you have the energy, and you have many more years to benefit from the degree.    My suggestion is to keep the full time job, and take night classes and take smaller steps. He tried it when he was 18 and having no money is not fun especially now he has more responsibility. He should check if his employer has any tuition assistance program as well, if the classes are business related, he can get reimbursed for the full amount. If not business related and his company will still pays for the school, the tuition assistance will be taxed after the first $5250 per calendar year.  5 - 6 Years should be plenty for part time, if he does not take the summers off. And I strongly advise him not to. The summer classes are shorter, and less expensive. Sometimes you can take the classes in other college and transfer the credits back to your school. This way, you can have much easier semesters during the year.  It will be hard and your whole family will have to make some sacrifice and commit to it. I assume he is a responsible adult and I have no doubt he can do it. When I talk to my colleagues, who doubted at the beginning if they can go back to school, they all say it is actually not that difficult. TIME MANAGEMENT is the key. If I waste 1 less hour per day, I have 7 hours extra time a week to focus on school work and rest.     I think nowadays, most kids that struggle in college spent too much time in parties and worry too much about where to go for spring breaks.|`|mdZLlhHDaa	I am proof that it is realistic. I started my college education at the age of 35, married with three small children and a small business that generated barely enough income. Fifteen years later I earned my doctorate degree.  The family MUST adjust to the new situation. Without family support (especially the wife) it will not be an easy task to accomplish. Remember, he's investing for LONG TERM future. Imagine yourself 10, 15 years down the road! it helps overcome frustration. If possible, enlist the help of your own parents and your in-laws, so you will not be overwhelmed. You need to recognize there will be a balance shift, but you can still maintain a balanced life. College is not so difficult, especially for students who have life experience.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Unfortunately, he won't.    Some couples choose to make this sort of sacrifice, together, to achieve something they both really want. But it has to be a decision you make together, because it'll be a very difficult five years.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Some can do it, some can't.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	I answer this with the old adage "Where there is a will there is a way".|`|0sJsTN83aa	Well, it can be done, but your concerns are very justified.  I've been the mom in college, and only working part-time it was miserable.  I never had time to study or relax, and so I did poorly in several of my more demanding classes.  If he's working 55 hours a week, being a full time student, and a full time parents, something will have to give over time.    He will get tired, stressed out, and will likely have to either drop his credit hours or cut back on work just to make it through.  Perhaps the best solution is to work out a realistic plan for him to take his credits from NCSU and work towards an associates.  Once he has the degree (which would only take about 95 credit hours in most schools, so about another year of college), he can stop or go from there.  But at least he will have that first degree to lean back on, which may ease his mind.      It will be difficult, but going to school for 9 months is much more manageable than going for three more years.  Take small steps, see how he handles it with everything else in life, then plan from there.  Good luck!|`|b7U12SHpaa	It will be very tough on all of you. You have to remember that most people go to college when they are eighteen and they don't have to worry about families or jobs etc. I know someone who went to college in her forties, she had a husband and two kids and even then found it difficult and she didn't even have a job to keep up with either. Also, it won't just be the work you have to do at college, but all the homework and presentations you will have to do for it at home.  If you do decide that college will be the best thing to do, you could maybe devise a rota where you split your time up equally between work, your family and college, maybe have a family day every saturday or sunday and work and complete your college stuff throughout the week. The most important thing to say though is if you want it badly enough, you will work out a way to do it. Before you decide, you could maybe do a pro and cons list to help you understand how easy/hard it could be.  Good Luck

wFBVuBOkaa	Both my mother and I were successful "late bloomers."<br>  <br>  In her case, she went to graduate school at a traditional university well over a decade after she'd gotten her B.A. In graduate school, she was one of the highest graduates in her class.<br>  <br>  In my case, I went to college right out of high school and got a B.A. with middling grades, but got burned out on my field. After three years of working somewhere totally unrelated, I went back to school for another B.A. and graduated with honors for the first time ever. I'm now in grad school and I'm looking at a PhD at some point.<br>  <br>  As someone who has been both a younger and an older student, and as a sometime-lecturer, I have two feelings on late bloomers whether they've been to college before or not (and these are generalizations, there are exceptions of course):<br>  <br>  1. The good: Those who enter late tend to have HUGE advantages. They know how to take care of themselves and take responsibility for their own lives. I hear almost no boyfriend/girlfriend drama from them, whereas some 19-year-olds will demand a make-up exam because their friend's brother's dog ran away the night before. Teenagers in college have more drama and have lower grades overall because they're still learning how to be on their own, they don't have good time-management skills, they haven't learned to resist the bars and the fake IDs. Older folk (23+) will follow directions, will present well-reasoned objections if they feel a rule is unfair, will take more responsibility for the value of their education because they realize just how much money tuition is, will pay attention to deadlines. Military veterans or current enlisted are some of my best students and classmates; it's sad when they get called up mid-semester, though.<br>  2. The bad: A small, but obnoxious, minority of older students will enter college with a massive entitlement complex. Almost all of the obnoxious older students are in the 40-60 range. These students believe that their life experience means they are allowed to tell younger students and even professors what to do and think. It's fine to offer your study tips to younger students who ask for it, but I've seen older students harangue younger ones unprovoked and tell them that their life experiences mean nothing, that their career choices are going to be obsolete by the time they graduate, that major sociological trends in our textbooks were nonexistent. Some older students believe that their family life - childcare problems, etc. - mean they should not be expected to turn in work that is inconvenient for them. There's a huge difference between asking a professor how you can make up work during a tough time, and *demanding* that you be excused for what should be ordinary life circumstances. I expect that because older students have had more practice at running their own lives, they should be held to the same standards as everyone else. Some older students in history courses will take a narrow "current events" approach and claim that, say, the 1950s were happy for everyone because they had a happy 1950s childhood; some vets will use their war experience to try to shut down any criticism or analysis of military actions. All of these "bad" older students have allowed themselves to be entrenched in a particular point of view, even though college is on some level about exposing you to new ideas and the experiences of others. (Younger students do this too, with "my mom and dad believe this so I believe it," but it's easier to get them out of that rut and think for themselves whether they eventually agree with mom and dad or not.)<br>  <br>  I stress that the second type, the unsuccessful older student, is the vast minority. 90% of the older students in my experience are smart, capable people who take college more seriously than a good 75% of younger students. I don't blame younger students for this, it's just the culture we have in which college is just what you do after high school and at 18-19 fresh out of Mom's spare bedroom is just not a good stage of life period. I think most people would be better and more successful students if they worked for a few years and then went to college a little bit older than they do now. Spend 18-21 knowing yourself, being on your own, destroying your liver, and sleeping with anything on two legs - THEN come to college once you're able to deal with being an adult.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	I went back to school at 24. I'm 26 and doing both college and work. It can be hard but I know its going to be worth it. 4-5 years out of your life is nothing compared to the rest of your life. In your 20s and 30s you don't have to worry about ageism so right now is the best time for us to go back. I think ageism starts around age 40-45 around there.
2PDBxlYDaa	Once you go to a community college then most colleges will just ask for your community college transcripts. However, there are some prestigious universities that will want to see your high school transcript, whether or not you dropped out. If you go to community college, they will ask if you have a diploma or a ged. Either one is fine, they don't care either way. A diploma and a ged are pretty much the same, neither of them will give you a better job, you usually need a bachelor's degree for a good job.

mSVXV2gbaa	Did you learn to consider how helping a friend would affect your actions?<br>  Do you have a juvenile record that will be sealed, or will this offense follow you for the rest of your life?<br>  Did you learn to consider other courses of action (taking the firecracker to the friend's house would most likely not have caused ANY issues)?<br>  Have you learned anything about public safety?<br>  Have you learned anything about individual responsibility (For example, I want to drive without my glasses so I look cute, but if I do, I'll probably hit someone.  SO...even though I have a right to look cute, I have a responsibility as a member of society not to put innocent folks in danger).<br>  Have you learned anything about the justice system?<br>  Have you learned anything about how good intentions don't necessarily mean good actions?  No one says about another person, "Well, he's a real jerk, but he never wanted to be."<br>  <br>  Hope these ideas help crystallize your thoughts so that what you write can be about what YOU learned!

s0h6sIRhaa	It's only a waste of time if you don't use it (i.e. you end up in a minimum wage job).  I might be wrong, but can't use use the poli sci degree to get into law school?  If that's your career goal, it's not a waste of time at all.  And if you just need a degree, then why not?  I got my degree in elementary ed, even though I knew for a year that I didn't want to teach.  I'm currently a bookkeeper, and going back to school for my second degree in Accounting.  That first one is not a waste, as it got all my general ed classes out of the way, I learned important things I can use with my own children some day, and it got me the job I have now so I can get more accounting experience, even though I had no prior education/experience other than my first bachelor's. <br>  <br>  You may wish to speak to your university's career counselor about your options, or even about switching majors if you're unhappy.|`|NBI2r47baa	Why would it be a waste of time?

But If you received a grade for it in the past, that would be analogous to payment, therefore if presented again,you would be plagiarising yourself (in their opinion). It still doesn't match the legal definition of plagiarism. At worst,it could be considered a form of cheating. IMO, I still think there's nothing wrong with it. I've done it myself at least once.|`|fmr98EBtaa	The only time I think it would make any sense would be when you are using someone else's work who happens to have your same name, or if an alternate personality were using your work without your permission.

This is an oxymoron.  If your professor is using this term, he/she is just a plain ol' moron.

I've made plans to have dinner.  I've been there many time.    In written English, when "have" is used as a full verb, not an auxiliary, it is not normally used in a contraction.    I have a car.  I have plans to have dinner this evening.    If this is an informal message, then it's O.K., but I wouldn't use "I've NOUN" in any formal messages.

0E0OaibEaa	Vascular Birthmarks:    The most common vascular birthmarks are macular stains, hemangiomas, and port-wine stains.  These occur when blood vessels don't form correctly.      Port wine stains, named so because they are a wine color are usually found on larger areas of the body, such as the leg, back etc. These typically don't not fade on their own.    Angel kiss birthmarks (macular stain) are smaller in size and usually show up on the face and are sometimes more noticeable when a child cries. These usually fade as the child grows up. (these are also sometimes called "stork bites" or "salmon stains" along with "angel kiss"    Simply put - the wine stain birthmark is large and does not fade with age.  The angel kiss birthmark is smaller and normally does fade with age.    more information here:  http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/bod...|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I assume you mean "angel" kiss.

LVPNuEsLaa	For each of your schools they will look at the combination of program strength, courses completed, and GPA.  They are expecting to see at least 3 solid post-transfer semesters (assuming 8 semesters to a degree) worth of coursework with a 3.0+ gpa at most grad schools.    Much more important is research experience and solid reference letters.  If you can do well on those (and a decent GRE) you may have a chance, but I think it more realistic that you will need to go into the workforce for a year or two and then apply again.

It is very difficult to earn the self respect, because you can not be called as the self respected man or woman unless you have some positive characters.  To be a self respected human being you will have to first learn to respect the other human being that you are in contact.  You should not poke your nose unless called in.  You should always take unbiased remarks whenever asked to you.  You must be knowledgeable person.  You must have kindness and sharpness in all matters of concern.  Only a Respected person will self respected person.  Respect your seniors, mentors, teachers.  Respect your country, your language, your religion and your community.  Respect your parents whole hearted.  Respect will earn love, respect will earn harmony, respect will earn friendship, Respect will earn universal oneness.

You have the teacher module which is kind of like the leader, and the student module. So the pc with the teacher module installed can see what all the other pc's with the student module are doing as well as close 'distracting' applications.    I've had classes that right in the middle of the lecture in a computer lab the teacher would go in Synchroneyes all of a sudden and catch students myspaceing or Instant messaging and would embarrass them infront of everyone since the image was projected into a giant screen.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Five Steps for Becoming a Veterinarian  Step One: Complete Undergraduate Courses: Although veterinary education requirements don't strictly dictate that an individual have a bachelor's degree before entering a doctorate program in veterinary medicine, all applicants do have to complete some preveterinary course requirements. Requirements range from 45 to 90 semester hours at an accredited college or university.   Step Two: Pass Admittance Tests: In order to gain admittance to an accredited program of veterinary medicine, individuals must submit test scores from the Graduate Record Exam, the Veterinary College Admission Test or the Medical College Admission Test.   Step Three: Receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Degree: All practicing veterinarians must have a doctorate degree in the field. Courses in the four-year program cover inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, general biology, animal biology, animal nutrition, zoology and more.   Step Four: Become a Veterinary Intern: Internships are becoming more and more common for aspiring veterinarians who have just graduated with a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine. Generally lasting for a period of one year, the internships provide a small salary in addition to clinical experience.   Step Five: Become a Licensed Veterinarian: All 50 states require that practicing veterinarians obtain licensure. Individuals must have a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine and must pass the eight hour North American Veterinary Licensing Exam to gain the necessary credential.   United States Veterinary Medical Schools and Colleges     Auburn University     Colorado State University     Cornell University     Iowa State University     Kansas State University     Louisiana State University     Michigan State University     Mississippi State University     North Carolina State University     Ohio State University     Oklahoma State University     Oregon State University     Purdue University     Texas A&M University     Tufts University     Tuskegee University     University of California, Davis     University of Florida     University of Georgia     University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign     University of Minnesota     University of Missouri     University of Pennsylvania     University of Tennessee     University of Wisconsin-Madison     Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine     Washington State University     Western University of Health Sciences|`|AA10023710	To become a vet, you first need a bachelors degree, and after you're done with that, you go to veterinary school. For your bachelors, you can go to any university you want, so long as it's good, and major in any subject you'd like. So in NO, a good school to target for your bachelors would be Tulane. It's a great school, good reputation. If you did well there, you'd go on to vet school afterwards. An example of a vet school is the one at Louisiana State U.

That's okay for the purposes of the three colleges I just mentioned. Yale might be out of your reach right now. For Yale, I believe you unweighted GPA must be 4.0 for you to be even considered!

There are lots of other responses as well, such as; ok, not so bad, wonderful, etc.  It all depends on the situation and how formal you want to be.  You should add "thank you" to whichever response you choose, and, under most circumstances, add "and you?".

We don't watch romantic movies (and if we're forced to we don't cry at the end), we don't announce to the world our love of the little lady and we figure that once a year is often enough to say "I love you".  Why do you want more?  It's a bit like speed signs, we say we love you and when conditions change we'll tell you something else.<br>  <br>  You want to write about a guy that doesn't open up to his wife, don't make up poor excuses for him, just call him normal.|`|9x8tOaIyaa	A lot of people, not necessarily men, have difficulty expressing themselves.

OJpjktj6aa	The Intolerable Acts or the Coercive Acts are names used to describe a series of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 relating to Britain's colonies in North America. The acts sparked outrage and resistance in the Thirteen Colonies and were important developments in the growth of the American Revolution.<br>  <br>  Four of the acts were issued in direct response to the Boston Tea Party of December 1773; the British government hoped these punitive measures would, by making an example of Massachusetts, reverse the trend of colonial resistance to parliamentary authority that had begun with the 1765 Stamp Act.<br>  <br>  Many colonists viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of their rights, and in 1774 they organized the First Continental Congress to coordinate a protest. As tensions escalated, the American Revolutionary War broke out the following year, eventually leading to the creation of an independent United States of America.
