20090128211321AA9XHvd	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Drain pipe frozen or plugged, how to fix?	My kitchen sink is backed up.  I can't figure out why.    When dumping water down the drain, it does not make it past the portion of the pipe that makes the " J " shape, then it comes back up.  I have tried Lots of Drano, Liquid Plum-er GEL. as well as Salt and boiling hot water,  that doesn't work either.      So I used a shop vac to suck all the water out of the drain and removed the J Shaped pipe.  There is no blockage between the drain and the " J " shaped pipe.  So I stuck a snake down in the pipe that the J shaped pipe connects to,  I go it about 4 feet of snake and then it stopped.  I can't tell if it stopped because it hit a right angle but that is my theory.    Anyways, I have verified that the water only flows to the J Shaped pipe and does not flow beyond.  But if there is a blockage it must be mauch farther into the piping.    Any help or ideas what is wrong?

20090128222003AAz92Iw	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Free, printable artwork?	I was watching one of the midday shows a few months ago.  They showed an inexpensive way to make art by going to a website that had a bunch of famous pictures downloaded that you could print onto multiple sheets of 8.5X11 sheets of paper and frame.  I can't remember the website.  I think the show was Rachael ray, but I've looked all over her site and can't find it.  Anyone know of a website that does this for free or at a reasonable price?  Thanks!

20090129035455AAoTQM6	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Why cant holiday caravans be used for homes?	Ive an idea. There are thousands of holiday homes/static caravans/lodges etc etc all over britain and a few residential sites for people usually over the age of 50. Why cant some of these sites be allowed to open for 12 months of the year, and to let people in need of affordable housing use these instead? Im not meaning for DSS wasters to fill these places and turn them into council estates, im meaning for them to be sold to be used as permanent homes. America seems to manage it with the trailer parks, and you only have to look on Rightmove to see the prices are affordable. Any ideas anyone?
