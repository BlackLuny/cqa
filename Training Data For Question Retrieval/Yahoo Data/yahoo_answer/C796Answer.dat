It's all a basic easy recipe.  I sweat green pepper, onion and garlic (all minced) in oil.  Just make them tender, not burned or brown.  Dump in bowl and add mustards.  I like Grey Poupon and hot chinese mustards for a kick.  Then some worchestershire or soy sauce.  Add your eggs and mix well.  Add your cooked fish then your bread crumbs.  This can be made ahead of time and chilled.<br>  <br>  Make patties or balls and fry until brown in a skillet with a tad of oil.  When I do balls, I use a deep fryer.  It makes for a better appetiser than patties for dinner.<br>  <br>  If you like this, you can add other fish, canned fish, tuna, shrimp, clams, oysters, squid or crab.  Drop the parsley as you won't taste it.  If you need to use it, then do so, but it doesn't add anything.  I would heat the fish stock cube in the worchestershire sauce before adding so it melts, but let that cool completely.|`|KT0UTX8taa	FISH CAKES  <br>  <br>  fish - preferably cod (frozen cod is fine)<br>  potatoes (instant is acceptable)<br>  2 level teaspoon salt to lb of fish<br>  parsley sprig ( dry herb parsley will do )<br>  <br>  Quantities are up to you. One pound of potatoes and one pound of fish would make enough for 4 servings.<br>  <br>  Boil and mash potatoes as usual. In the meantime, poach (heat in water) the fish in a frying pan or shallow pan. Do not allow the water to boil and break the fish apart; keep the fish whole. The fish is done when it flakes apart easily.<br>  <br>  Drain water, remove skin and bones, if any. You now have equal amounts of mashed potatoes and fish. Mash gently and briefly. Cod takes longer than the softer fish (ie. Pollock, Porgy).<br>  <br>  Fold the fish and salt into the potatoes. Salt can be added to taste, which is easily done, as both are fully cooked by mixing time and tasting is best and accurate.<br>  <br>  Place in the refrigerator to cool or freeze for later use. On the same day or later, make hamburger sized patties with the mix. Set a thin coat of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.<br>  <br>  When the cakes are placed into the pan they should sizzle at the edges. If not, just add a tiny bit of oil near those that don't sizzle. Four to five minutes on one side should show a golden or brown finish. Turn each one and repeat the color on the second side.<br>  <br>  Recommended accompaniments:<br>  <br>  Heat enough whole tomatoes for each serving (canned is fine). Serve with butter at the table and any favorite vegetable.<br>  <br>  Presentation:<br>  <br>  Set 2 cakes on a plate, one tomato and garnish with parsley sprigs (or dry herb parsley around the cakes). The parsley is intended as a part of the flavor, not just as a garnish.<br>  <br>  Fish cakes are traditionally made with salted dry cod fish, known as bacala. This is very salty even when water is used to restore the flesh and drain off the salty water several times over a 24 hour period. However, when properly done it makes an excellent cake. This is the reason for salt being added in the recipe. With fresh cod it is added and with dry cod it is removed until palatable.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	i say boil the fish and potatoes in some water with the fish stock cube, and lemon.  strain and mash together. then in one shallow pan put the 2 eggs beatened and add a little water, and in another shallow pan add half of the parsley, all the breadcrumbs, salt and pepper.  once the fish and potato mixture has cooled, shape into patties.  dip them into the egg mixture, then coat them in breadcrumbs and fry or bake. good luck.

He also had some mental health issues and alcohol was one way for him to self medicate. Alcohol being a depressant, that never ended well for him.<br>  <br>  Any anti-depressants will react with alcohol, as you've noticed. Unfortunately it doesn't just make you a lightweight. It also speeds damage to your liver, kidneys and pancreas. The bulimia is impacting your teeth, esophagus and stomach - not to mention spiking your body fat percentages as your body goes into starvation mode and starts hoarding fat and burning muscle. This is not good. You're too young to be self destructing. :-(<br>  <br>  You do have a lot of issues here, and you do need to get some sort of help  to overcome them. Most Universities offer peer  counseling at the very least, and if you have a religious affiliation, you can also receive counseling through your church/temple/mosque/coven/Kindred - whatever people of that faith call themselves as a group. My Kindred counsels members of our faith even if they're not members of our Kindred, so I would imagine people of other faiths do that as well. If you have no religious affiliation, you can also contact human services for your area. Most places will offer free or low-cost counseling to those who can't afford it. So you'll get the peer counseling, possibly faith based counseling and professional counseling.  Attack your issues from all angles with differing points of view. Cover all your bases.<br>  <br>  See? You can beat  all of this stuff you have going on, because you're going to have help to do it! All you have to do is go ask for it. Good luck and I do sincerely hope you can pull yourself up out of all of this (with help, of course) and come out with a greater understanding of, and appreciation for, your own self.|`|NC5yAsbFaa	YOU SHOULD TRY THE AURIVA DIC MADEICINE WHICH IS VERY HELPFULL AND I TWLL U SITE WHERE U BUY IT IN INDIA JUST GO TO WWW.HCI-INDIA.IN.<br>  THIS MEDICINE IS REALLY HWLFUULL TO U BYE|`|f5Kfo8BEaa	if you  have to ask...then you are|`|W5uXirA5aa	I agree uni srink!!!|`|fwnqB0dTaa	NO<br>  <br>  You are a binge drinker, not an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  Alcoholics have a need to drink every day, you obviously don't.
pMFLqU0Yaa	As long as your own yogurt is still alive, then yes, you can use your own  yogurt as the culture for the next batch. One of my elderly aunts made her own yogurt and that was the method she used for decades. <br>  <br>  Have fun making yogurt! Homemade is so much better!|`|CnGR2xeoaa	You can use off the shelf plain yogurt for your starter. Don't use the easiyo for your starter, it doesn't have a very good consistency. <br>  Also don't add your flavorings until after the yogurt has incubated.<br>  It is important to bring your milk to just under a boil for about ten minutes then let it cool to about 43 celsius before you add your starter, this kills any potentially harmful bacteria. Also make sure your equipment is sterile before use. Your mixture needs to remain at a constant temperature of about 43 celsius for about 6-12 hours. The longer it incubates the stronger and more sour the flavor but the firmer your yogurt. You can add a small amount of powdered milk (before heating) for a firmer, creamier texture. <br>  Don't add your flavorings until after the incubation period as whatever bacteria they contain will incubate with it if you add it too early.<br>  After you make your first batch you can save a small amount and use it as a starter for the next batch. Only save and use plain yogurt for your starter for the best results.<br>  I used to make my own yogurt until I found I am allergic to dairy.|`|Td4Wn8XMaa	not sure about Easiyo system, but i would think so, how ever Guar Gum & Locust Bean Gum are both ok|`|lzKipZHhaa	no i do not believe this is posible...|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i know you probably think you can, becoz in medieval time, people do that all the time. but the problem is the chance to catch fungi infection due to sanitation deffiency at home.<br>  <br>  so yea, the chance is there, you could catch it, you could not. in modern days, there's really not necessary to do that in a medieval time of fashion.|`|MIlpLLZcaa	Yes you can and as for the gums: guar gum is a natural thickener and so is locust bean gum.

PxJXJKCpaa	Are you seriously asking this?  It's because people are forgetful, don't like certain foods and could be allergic.  Take shrimp alfredo for example.  I'm allergic to shell fish, so lets do chicken.  I'm allergic to milk, so lets do soy milk or red sauce.  It's 3am and I don't remember how much onion to put in the pan, or was it saute' first.<br>  <br>  I'm not allergic, but just giving you ideas.

hT7BhNamaa	K, is it a whole fish could you describe it or fillet? If they are fillet, I would season with a little sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, some roughly chopped thyme leaves, a sprinkle of paprika, squeeze lime or lemon juice and a little drizzle of the olive oil, do it on the pan after you have done the next step. Just lightly brush your sheet pan with a little olive oil or spray with Pam place you fish on the pan, into the oven 400F 15 to 20 minutes if thick pieces. Keep an eye on it may not need the full 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  I would plate it and have a nice tossed salad to go with it.

It is a most wonderful snack, plus its cheap, easy, and delicious.<br>  <br>  and by the way, you realize you posted this question about 3 times right?|`|UDl8Ac76aa	Since I'm asian, I made bento. Rice with many side dishes (small portions). Sometimes sandwiches only, and sometimes fried noodle.
AA10927032	Hmmm, it would have to be packed with nutrition, and able to travel well, and not spoil easily. Oatmeal cookies come to mind, skip the butter and use Crisco with it's higher melting point, and it is less likely to spoil quickly. There was a recipe my Mom had that mixed up oatmeal and she dropped it on a cookie sheet. I hated them, so that  must mean that they were nutritional. <br>  I would experiment and find out if adding some kind of dried fruit would make it less durable. Raisins and apricots come to mind. <br>  Have you looked up Anzac cookies yet, to see what was in them? I typed it into the browser, and Wikipedia had the ingredients listed in the browser menu choices. Figured it might have coconut in it, that is the most concentrated natural sweet on earth, and along with the syrup, that packed a quick  energy punch, and the oatmeal was slowerfor the body to digest, so they had some stick to the ribs qualities, too.<br>  Not so much nutritional, but Mom's molasses cookies/gingersnaps cool off and are hard, very little crumbling. The ones you buy at the store in the bags that are little would work, I think you could sit on them and not break them. And ginger is a restorative spice, people with upset tummy's use ginger to help them. <br>  A soft cookie would work if it were going to be tinned like a c-ration. Peanut butter cookies, the soft thick ones that you stick your finger in and put a Hershey's kiss in might work. Of course, without the kiss in it.|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Peanut butter, chocolate chips, raisins, oatmeal|`|8msW4aklaa	raisins, granola and oatmeal look for a raisin oatmeal cookies and add a 1/2 cup of granola. but 1/3 cup more of flour so i'll be more hard
c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Seedless grapes are hybrids from parents that are genetically divergent enough to make them sterile. If you mean how do they grow more of the plants, they are propagated from cuttings that are grafted to a hardy rootstock. Although grape cuttings can also be rooted on their own.|`|iuwLHT2Taa	Seedlessness is a highly desirable subjective quality in table grape selection, and seedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is, however, an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques.<br>  There are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson Seedless, Russian Seedless, and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of Vitis vinifera. There are currently more than a dozen varieties of seedless grapes. Several, such as Einset Seedless, Reliance and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of north-eastern United States and southern Ontario<br>  An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched phytochemical content of grape seeds (see Health claims, below)|`|NHcofGSyaa	Ive been searching for the answer as well.  But definitely there are other means like grafting.  Actually seedless grapes still has the seeds, only smaller. :-)|`|omhlhk8faa	The grape vines are cloned from other vines.

Then you put your own veg on, then your gravy. You can go up again but you can only have vegtables. The meat is only on offer the 1st time you go up.

j0mI8l07aa	Kinda depends on what you plan on doing with them. For shrimp cocktail, I'd just thaw them and wash them really well. Otherwise once they are thawed I'd just drop them in some boiling water for just a few seconds (any longer than that and they will be like rubber). Or if you have a steamer, get that nice and hot and pop them in for just a minute. Whatever you do though don't cook them long or they'll be rubbery. Keep in mind that even when completely RAW shrimp only takes a few minutes to cook.
uauJyxJNaa	Yes.  You can.  It won't taste as good, and it will be a bit mushy...especially if you are putting it in there frozen.  But it can definitely be done.  Fish does NOT take long to cook, so don't over zap it.  I would even let it cook for about 2 minutes, then drain the excess water off before completely cooking it.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	wth would you want to microwave anything fresh, the microwave will kill 25% of the flavor instantly...why dont you grill, saute, fry, bake, broil it.|`|AA11786341	Microwave Tilapia <br>  <br>  1 pound tilapia fillets <br>  1 tablespoon butter <br>  1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon <br>  <br>  In a microwavable baking dish, arrange tilapia fillets in a single layer.

ZB0393Kkaa	OK, I'm going to give a serious, thoughtful answer because obviously these idiots up above me think all drinkers are problem drinkers. That simply isn't the case and you've given me no indication that you're a problem drinker (hey, having a bit of alcohol is actually good for the heart, and it's not just red wine either). <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you may have bladder control issues, not alcohol issues. Does it happen when you slam down any other liquid? If so, there are certain things you can do...you'll have to look online though. Switching to hard liquor won't help this. However, whatever comes of this, don't let these numbnuts above me try to freak you out into thinking you have an alcohol problem. I really hate self-righteous teetotalers (especially seeing as how moderate drinkers live 2 to 3 years longer than lifetime teetotalers).|`|lzjtINvCaa	I drank every day for 15 yrs and always said that when I pissed my pants that's when I would stop it never happened I just stopped cold turkey, if I were you I would stop drinking you have a problem|`|I7qHLCQqaa	It is so strange to see these people get down on you about drinking. Its as if they are 14 year old children, or guidance counselors that host after school specials. I drink about once or twice a week and believe me, I am relentlessly loyal to my duties. If you can effortlessly put alcohol aside without a second thought to pursue avenues of greatness in life, you have no problem. <br>  <br>  So anyway, I doubt switching to hard liquor will help any. Drinking alcohol, as you know, makes you urinate more often than other beverages may. <br>  <br>  Its probably a bladder issue, and alcohol illuminates the problem more so than other beverages because it expedites the urine cycle. <br>  <br>  See a doctor about the bladder issue. Doctors know best about the body. They are not your mother or guidance counselor so they can give a relaxed account of what is going on, hell, the doctor will probably go out for a drink after work.|`|fR9ENBmEaa	sounds as though you may have another problem.Hard liqour will only make the problem worse.Do you drink a lot?You could ask your doctor about this as there are exercises and other treatments for this type of problem.Do you have this problem when you are not drinking?|`|ldXSIWEyaa	sounds like just a bigger problem than drinking alcohol, they are both alcoholic beverages so i would assume they would do the same thing. maybe you are drinking too much, and should just stop all together!|`|Ki53nVyhaa	1 ANSWER COMES TO MIND.

I'm American and I make mine with powdered sugar, butter or shortening, a pinch of salt, milk, and vanilla.  I mix it with a mixer until it's creamy and fluffy.  I make my chocolate frosting by adding cocoa, and substituting strong coffee for the milk.

Sauté until they tender. Add the diced cooked bacon, blend well, and turn off the heat. Add the warm spaghetti and blend all ingredients together thoroughly. Add the warm sauce (below), pepper, parsley and salt and blend thoroughly. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.<br>  Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, melt butter; add flour and cook on medium-low heat for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add milk continue cooking and stirring just until sauce begins to bubble.

And, recent studies show that just one serving of salmon per week can significantly lower your chance of cardiac arrest. And did I mention that this stuff actually tastes good?<br>  <br>  Start by making sure to drain your canned salmon well, then empty into a large mixing bowl. Break apart bigger chunks with a fork, and combine all of the remaining ingredients except for the parsley, and mix thoroughly.<br>  <br>  Serve the Wild Alaskan Salmon Salad<br>  Wild Alaskan salmon salad is a delicious treat on its own - serve on a leaf of lettuce and sprinkle with the parsley to garnish, or enjoy it in a whole wheat tortilla.

AA12336927	its not at all like shake and bake. You can make it with chicken or steak, pounded thin. Here is the only recipe I like to use:<br>  Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak with Cream Gravy<br>  It is hard to get much more Texan than Chicken Fried Steak. Quality of the beef really counts in this dish. This recipe calls for cube steaks, but good round steak that you have asked the butcher to run through the tenderizer or that you have tenderized yourself with a mallet (no big deal and can be a real stress reliever) can be even better.<br>  <br>      * 4 tenderized beef cutlets (known in supermarkets as "cube steak") OR 1 round steak, with fat removed, that you've tenderized yourself (see above)<br>      * 1 egg<br>      * 1/4 cup milk<br>      * all-purpose flour<br>      * cooking oil or melted Crisco?<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon paprika<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon white pepper<br>  <br>  Beat together the egg and milk and set aside. Mix together the salt, black pepper, paprika and white pepper and sprinkle on both sides of beef cutlets.<br>  <br>  Dredge the cutlets in the flour, shaking off the excess. Then dip each cutlet in the egg/milk mixture, then back in the flour. (You're going to get your hands messy here, so take your rings off.) Set cutlets aside on a piece of waxed paper.<br>  <br>  Heat the cooking oil in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Oil should be about a half-inch deep in the pan. Check the temperature with a drop of water; if it pops and spits back at you, it's ready.<br>  <br>  With a long-handled fork, carefully place each cutlet into the hot oil. Protect yourself (and your kitchen) from the popping grease that results. Fry cutlets on both sides, turning once, until golden brown. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook 4 or 5 minutes until cutlets are done through. Drain cutlets on paper towels.<br>  <br>  Cream Gravy<br>  After the cutlets are removed from the pan, pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of oil, keeping as many as possible of the browned bits in the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until hot.<br>  <br>  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour (use the left-over flour from the chicken fried steak recipe) in the hot oil. Stir with a wooden spoon, quickly, to brown the flour.<br>  <br>  Gradually stir in 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water, mixed together, stirring constantly with the wooden spoon and mashing out any lumps. Lower heat, and gravy will begin to thicken. Continue cooking and stirring a few minutes until gravy reaches desired thickness. Check seasonings and add more salt and pepper according to your taste.<br>  <br>  Note to Cream Gravy novices: Gravy-making is an inexact science. Cream gravy is supposed to be thick, but if you think it's too thick, add more liquid until you're satisfied with it.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Go Stillers, I soak my chicken in butter milk for a while first.

NHcofGSyaa	You can just try eating fruits as replacement of candies instead.  You can eat green fragrant pears, bananas, philippine mangoes as alternatives.  There are also sugar-free foods (thanks to aspartame) which you can take but only in limited amounts per day.  These alternatives will keep you away from killing your pancreas and its insulin secretion.|`|H2txnM65aa	The only way out of this one is to maybe half the amounts your eating and start from there? then gradually maybe if you serious about this you can cut it completely from you diet! Also make sure you don't brush your teeth straight after you eat because acid lies on your enamels and makes them slightly softer. brushing over this can gradually wear your teeth away, always wait around half an hour before brushing them!
hT7BhNamaa	Eliza, for pasta the water boils first, then just before you add your pasta you salt it. Carrots I steam, potatoes I boil from cold.

I start from cold, when the water starts to boil I time three minutes, and i get perfect soft boiled eggs for breakfast all the time. <br>  <br>  If I am going to blanch lets say swiss chard or spinach, my water has to be boiling. <br>  <br>  Does that help?<br>  <br>  Chris|`|9CN0otoQaa	If it's vegetables, you can put the water on them, then bring to a boil.  For pasta, always have the water boiling first, or the pasta will stick together.|`|1zLibhBbaa	Eliza, It really depends on the type of food. Pasta needs to have the water boiling first to where if you are simmering a stock you start with COLD water and ingredients in the pot.  Or soup for example, you start by sauteeing the ingredients then add the water. Hope this helps.

Don't leave the vinegar or lemon on to long if it is non-stick as the acid may erode it.  Wash well rub the acidic fluid over it and then wash and rinse again.  This may work.

hHCdXq0Naa	For espresso, neither one.  French press won't make espresso coffee.  You'll just get regular coffee, made with espresso beans.  Stovetop espresso machines are too messy and unreliable.  I have a DeLonghi Magnifica 3300 espresso machine which is absolutely WONDERFUL!  It has a reserve for beans, and grinds them fresh for each cup;  plus a water reserve and reserve for used grinds (so you don't have to empty them out each time).  You just push a button for wonderful espresso; and don't have to wait for it to cool down in-between cups (like cheaper machines).|`|F0uLexezaa	french press...put in the coffee, pour the water and press the plunger and voila it's done|`|2A0E3bivaa	I would most definitely go with the french press, it make very good coffee if used correctly. The stove top espresso machines does not actually make real espresso since the pressure created from boiling water is not high enough. It really depends on if you want small amounts of really strong coffee or a large amount of "normal" coffee.|`|3gcIXwowaa	French press doesn't make actual espresso but you can get that deep, dark, rich and robust java you want.  I use a French press to make Hawaiian coffee and it's a perfect dark cup every time.

I order online at <a href="https://konaluna.com" rel="nofollow">https://konaluna.com</a> and their website tells the story of Kona coffee and what makes it so flavorful.|`|Nhje1U06aa	I like the french press  very simple and the coffee is always perfect!|`|jpqSnCpuaa	French press is better in my opinion but they are both great!
mzk0t6Ovaa	If you have fairly fresh coriander seeds, they'll impart a rich citrusy<br>  note that will work well with the lemon and not clash with the<br>  rosemary.<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to skip any extra herbs/spices and<br>  rely on the rosemary to carry the dish.

Plan the movie theme - I like old black and white grade D science fiction - they can be so funny.  Like The Blob or Day of the Triffids or any old black and white Godzilla movie.  Keep the remote handy so you can stop the movie and talk about what the dialogue should have been in one scene.  Play about 2-3 old moview and have intermission so everyone can walk around and eat and chat.

HXadRqVfaa	I put approx. 4 cups of water on to boil. Once it boils, I remove it from the heat and add 4 family-size Lipton tea bags. Let this steep for up to 30 minutes depending on how strong you like it. I then put 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the bottom of the pitcher, pour the warm liquid into it, stirring well to make sure that all of the sugar dissolves and then finish filling the pitcher with cool water. Stir one more time to make sure that the water and tea mixture is mixed. The sweetened tea is heavier than the cold water so you need that final stir.|`|32g69LSZaa	My pitcher for keeping sweet tea holds about a gallon. Here's what I do:<br>  <br>  Put a pot of water on the stove (about 4 cups doesn't matter too much though) and bring it to a boil. Turn off the heat and add 3 or 4 big tea bags, I like Luzianne the best. Cover the pot and let the tea steep for about 10 minutes. Add 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar (sometimes I just add 2 cups anyway) and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Move this to your pitcher and fill the rest of the way with cold water.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	To make Sweet Tea correctly, you need to make a simple syrup.  Don't just dump sugar in and hope that it dissolves evenly throughout!   I make a pitcher of strong tea, using Lipton's COLD BREW (4 pitcher-sized bags per pitcher) - this "brews" in 5 minutes on the counter (no cooking and much stronger than sun tea).   Then, make a simple syrup by simmering about 4 cups of water with 2-3 cups of sugar (whisking frequently), until the sugar is totally dissolved and it's slightly thickened.  You can store the cooled syrup in the refrigerator and add it to the pitcher (or a glass) of tea for perfect, smooth tea.  (You can even use  a little of the syrup to toss in with fruit salads).   Fresh mint leaves are a nice garnish too.........

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning. <br>  <br>  MAKING THE DUMPLINGS: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. <br>  <br>  COOKING THE DUMPLINGS: In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. <br>  <br>  For Dipping Sauce: <br>  1/4 cup red-wine vinegar <br>  1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce <br>  2 tablespoons sugar <br>  1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil <br>  1 scallion, thinly sliced <br>  2 teaspoons grated peeled ginger root <br>  1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br>  <br>  Alternate Dumpling Dipping Sauce:<br>  2   Tbs soy sauce<br>  1   Tbs rice wine (shaohsing)<br>  2   Tbs sesame oil<br>  1.5 tsp minced ginger<br>  1.5 tsp minced garlic|`|l4tZTALfaa	wrap it up in foil and set it on the grill with coals to one side and the loin on the other add hickory chips to the coa;s every two hours and add coa;s as needed for about 6 hours remove it silce it up and put it in a cake pan and pour warm beef broth over it such as wylers about 1 cup and eat !! yummy add bbq sauce if u wish but I like it on rolls all by its self...<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  put it in a crock pot and let it go over night just add salt and garlic  and bbq sauce if u like<br>  <br>  <br>  or<br>   roast it for 3 hrs at 350 with one beer and potatoes carrots and celery ,onions and garlic like a pot roast cook longer if needed for tenderness<br>  <br>  <br>  or the link below has many other ideas have fun|`|ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  Here are two of my favorites, though you would need to adjust the ingredients and cooking time for your 7 lb roast.<br>  <br>  Beer-Braised Pork Loin<br>  Ready In: 2-5 hrs<br>  <br>  1 pork loin roast (about 5 pound size)<br>  3 cups chopped onion<br>  5 carrots, pared and diced<br>  12 ounces dark beer<br>  2 teaspoons salt<br>  1/4 teaspoon pepper<br>  1 bay leaf<br>  4 whole cloves<br>  <br>  Brown pork loin roast in hot oil in a large Dutch oven or roasting pan.

AA11786341	Besides adding a wonderful earthy taste and meaty texture to foods, mushrooms also contain essential nutrients.<br>  <br>   There are many health benefits to eating mushrooms.<br>  <br>   They are a great source of phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and selenium, nutrients often lacking in our highly processed-food diets. <br>  <br>  In addition, mushrooms contain virtually no fat or cholesterol.<br>  <br>   Naturally low in sodium, mushrooms are also a good source of fiber. <br>  <br>  One word of caution: Some varieties of mushrooms are toxic, so if you're fond of foraging in the woods for your supper, make sure you know which mushrooms are safe to eat.

The skin is delicious with just the right texture and saltiness. If your get there first you can choose the mean from the part you want. The meat is flavorful unlike the lechon preferred by those in luzon which needs the liver sauce to supply additional flavor.

Tea is a wonderful antioxidant and a great deal of people drink it for health reasons (the no sugar is also helpful). But keep in mind, that the longer a tea bag sits in water the more caffiene it releases and if you drink lots of tea you may want to brush your teeth more often (as it will contribute to staining).<br>  <br>  Yes, milk can be fatting; try 2% or skim.

But that doesnt make the milk bad, take note of the high nutritional content a milk is composed of.

Ki53nVyhaa	Alcohol was used in the past to kill germs and bacteria on surgical instruments and was given to people who had colds, flu and other illnesses.  Drinking alcohol is absorbed in the body and does kill some bacteria and germs in the stomach but depending on the amount of bacteria and germs it is possible that not all of them would be killed and you would still have the same problem.  Visit a doctor and see if their is an antibiotic available that would be much stronger and designed to kill the bacteria you might have|`|fR9ENBmEaa	no.you need to see your doctor if you are sick.Could make it worse.alcohol is hard on the stomach lining and will leave you dehydrated.|`|NC5yAsbFaa	YES IT , KILLS THE BAD BACTERIA BUT DON,T START DRINKING ALCOHOL,|`|JW1tsvDnaa	No. Sounds like wishful thinking to me lol,|`|ejuJiZAAaa	yes , i can vouch for that. did you know when Alexander the Great first came to India, he decided that the water in India was not fit for drinking so he drank only wine while he conquered the Indian subcontinent.<br>  drink strong, drink whiskey<br>  here are my thoughts on vodka and whiskey<br>  see to me vodka is like a woman i can have any time while whiskey is more elusive, harder to get and when and if you do get her, too hot to handle. i havent come across any person who truly loves drinking who does not prefer whiskey. even though in alcohol content vodka and whiskey stack up to the same height, whiskey is certainly stronger. ask anyone who has ever had a sip. certainly at first the taste is most repulsive and putrid, hell even i took years to develop a taste for it. i admit, it was too hard to handle and like all drinker and conneiesours i too made vodka my first love. Vodka is like the shy girl standing alone in a corner smiling at you. you know she's not the best girl in the room but she certainly has a certain charm and grace about her. you move in for the kill. you win.you get her.<br>  <br>   whiskey however is different. remember that really beautiful girl standing in all her hotness surrounded by a group of ga gaa admirers, friends and wannabes. you look at her and catch her eye, however you look down before she even blinks. her hair shines, her teeth sparkle, her eyes make hearts beat faster. you know shes too good for you.that's whiskey for you. you can never get enough<br>  <br>   but no one can handle all that they desire. i drank vodka, i still do. i loved vodka, still do, but its more of an old flame sort of thing now. whiskey is my woman now. truly a mans drink.<br>  <br>  cheers!<br>  **** fear, drink beer

hT7BhNamaa	Hazel, don't you dare remove the skin and bone, your bone adds to the flavor, and the skin also to make that crackling. At 375, your looking at a good three hours if not more. <br>  <br>  What I do is a diamond score the skin only, massage the whole leg of ( I am assuming here it is uncooked of course) pork with olive, and rub course sea salt into the cuts. Pierce some holes in the leg and you can add some whole cloves of cleaned garlic in the holes if you wish. Now you can do this a couple of ways. I place my leg on a rack and then into the baking dish, and add water to the base of the rack. Into the oven which should be already preheating, and turn the temp up to 500, and cook until you see the skin bubble and and turn color, then I turn the heat down to the 375F.<br>  <br>  In the mean time I will squeeze 2 oranges, and add those to the pan and the orange also this will be the start of your orange glaze or basting, this will reduce. <br>  <br>  Hazel, after an hour or so, without burning yourself, carefully turn the leg over to get some color on the bottom and to get an even cook, and baste also with those reducing juices. <br>  <br>  You will have to turn it again after an hour and baste. you do not have to add the orange if you don't wish, you can just use the pork drippings to baste. You can add rosemary leaves and thyme leaves also if you want for added flavor. <br>  <br>  You get the general idea. I said a few hours cooking time, so you will keep an eye on it, a few hours would be minimum, and then you have to let it stand for 15 to 20 minutes covered in a foil tent after you take it out of the oven.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|wqAgZkKhaa	By BETTY ROSBOTTOM  Our house sometimes seems like a bed-and-breakfast because friends and family come so often to visit.

Happened to me and when I did pat dry the chicken it did not lose the flavor from my marinade.|`|fysEkCIUaa	Nothing, the juice from the marinade and the chicken itself released its natural juices. You did the right thing by pouring it off.|`|w6vGajYjaa	I'm with Dune, here.<br>  <br>  You crowded the pan, the temperature dropped and you ended up boiling the chicken in its own juices.|`|AA10928232	You put too much chicken in the pan at once.  Next time, cook in 2-3 batches.|`|tu3Rn6BMaa	why don't you try just sprinkling the chicken with salt, pepper, dill, lemon zest, etc. (whatever you like) a little dusting of flour helps too (like a tablespoon).....then saute in a little hot olive oil.

Superiority - I don't believe I am superior to people because of my diet, I just feel I know more about good nutrition than most of the certified "Nutritionists" and "doctors" around. I also love helping people and helping them transition in diets, and lifestyles, but I do not push my views on someone who will not respond. I offer good advice if asked but most of the time they just want to hear a bit about the diet. <br>  <br>  It's not vegan to consume honey, although some vegans do. There is quite a lot of controversy over that subject. A lot of vegans don't know how the bees are treated, or if you are vegan for health reason's, it isn't an issue for them. Although it's not really vegan, but vegan is about doing all you can if you accidently had honey it would be ok but just be more careful - there are substitutes for honey so there is no reason to eat it. Agave nectar, maple syrup, date syrup, etc. <br>  <br>  Check out some raw food websites and have a look around, I feel that you are too quick to judge.

tIfo0GVqaa	Look for bacon with a bit more meat than fat. <br>  <br>  -If the fat on the bacon is at all translucent, it's not cooked enough. Give it more time.<br>  -If your bacon is very crispy in the pan, you've cooked it too long! Bacon gets crisper as it cools.<br>  -When the fat goes from generating big bubbles to producing small foamy bubbles, your bacon is just about done.<br>  -If your bacon is still a little bendy, and the fat is opaque, it's just right. Use tongs to remove it from the cooking surface, and place it on a paper towel.<br>  -When you've moved your bacon to a paper towel, use another to blot off the fat for perfectly crispy bacon.<br>  <br>  bacon with grill cuz with frying pan its hard if you are new<br>  -heat your grill to a low-to-medium temperature. (The higher the temperature, the more likely dripping bacon grease will catch fire and cause flares.)<br>  -place your bacon on the grill grates.<br>  -leave the grill lid open.<br>  -flip the bacon every five minutes.<br>  -your bacon should be done in about twenty minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  to make toast you just put your slice of bread in the slot of the toaster,push the handle down then wait til the bread slice pops up.wen it pops up it be hot, thats wen you let it cool to warm then quickly spread it with butter, the heat melts the butter.<br>  <br>  to make the omelette which is a flat egg surface(scrambled eggs is bits of lumpy eggs clustered together)<br>  <br>  -use a standard non-stick medium skillet. spray a very light coat of Pam or other cooking spray over the whole pan. Let the pan warm to a medium-low heat (like, 4 on a scale of 10).<br>  -in a bowl, add a bit of milk to your eggs. I don't know how to explain how much milk, because I forgot to measure it. I guess about a quarter of a cup -- it's an eyeball thing.I know some people leave it out, but I believe the milk is the 1st key to a perfect omelette.<br>  -add some seasoning to taste. I like a little salt and fresh-ground pepper. Whisk the eggs.<br>  -pour the egg mixture in the skillet, and swish it around so that a fine layer of egg sticks to the side of the pan.Do this by picking up the skillet and rotating it slightly. <br>  -leave the egg mixture alone for a few minutes to allow it to cook and "set up." You will know the egg has cooked enough to proceed when the egg whites have actually turned white n solid<br>  -when the egg is about 70% cooked solid, it is time for the second swish. whatever liquid mixture is left in the skillet, swirl it around the edges again to make the crispy edge layer thicker.<br>  -Let the omelet continue to cook until the crispy thin egg edge starts to pull away from the pan. <br>  -The edges should really be pulling away from the pan now. Take your fork and run the tines around the outside edge of the omelet, to make sure the egg layer has not stuck. Then, you can use your thumb and forefinger to grab the empty side of the omelet and fold it over.be gentle: the egg layer is delicate -- you don't want to tear it.<br>  -get your plate out while you let the folded omelet sit for about 30 seconds.take a spatula and run it under the omelet to make sure it is not stuck to the pan.get ready for the slide!<br>  -angle the skillet over your plate and slide.omelette should slip nicely out of the pan and onto the plate. <br>  -both sides are little brown.time to serve.|`|0MuRCU5paa	Your mom won't wake up?|`|0muvYszmaa	well first you cook the food then you eat it.|`|z1RmCqBbaa	i cut the bacon into strips and i put it in the pan so it can start cooking. you wait till it starts getting brown and crisp. eggs, i'm not really good at cuz no matter how i make the m, they always come out scrambled, lol.you scramble the eggs in a bowl with salt and pepper and then pour it in the pan. not the pan with bacon in it. you let it cook for a little bit until it looks cooked and with a spatula, you oly flip half of it over and wait for it to cook. and with the toast, you put the butter on after you make the toast, or else the bread would burn(personal experience, lol). your toaster should have a timer on it or you cantake the bread out the proper way yourself to get the toast how you want it. good luck and i want some, lol.

3oNcHdgCaa	Distilled liquor wasn't around until at least the middle ages. Beer had been around since the ancient Egyptians (and probably even earlier), but it wasn't popular in Palestine for some reason. Besides, red wine looks a lot more like blood than beer, so it works better symbolically when you're performing an act of ritualistic cannibalism such as Communion..|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Actually, you have to take into account the technology of the time. I often harvest wild yeasts for my bread making and grapes are a good source of this wild, regional yeast. It's much easier to ferment grapes into a tasty alcoholic beverage than it is to ferment things like wheat. I imagine it would simply have been a practical matter rather than a spiritual matter. Some churches use grape juice rather than wine in their rituals, but I think that's just sticking with tradition. In my (non-christian) faith, it is the intent behind the offering, not the content. When I did blót this morning, I used coffee as I had no aqvavit or wine or mead or ale open and I'm not a big drinker in the first place. It was the intent, not the substance that I was pouring out onto the ground. (or had it been a sumbel, the substance I was drinking) I would imagine that some of the christian faiths believe the same way but simply choose to stick to tradition of grape-based beverages.<br>  <br>  If it is intent and not the actual substance,  they could substitute whatever they wished if they so chose.|`|rkadldDcaa	i would take that as a no. you cant substitute! thats like going oh i killed bob but i opened the car door for him that makes up for my sin right??<br>  <br>  weather stop being a dingdong. even HISTORY said he exised you cant deny his existance no matter how athiest you are. you can BELIEVE he didnt do what he did but your just denying the truth|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	You can substitute anything for wine if it's a legitimate Mass.<br>  Keep in mind that that many times since this began if there was no wine available to the clergy, they could use fruit juice or whatever they had on hand.<br>  The wine is just symbolic and not necessary.|`|YmRv7lJXaa	Probably because it tasted better than the awful tasting (and don't forget warm) beer they would have been able to make back then since they had no hops to flavor the mash.|`|ENzHIUdOaa	Whiskey requires a distillery process, which was not yet invented.

aiKLvwGTaa	Not a huge percentage.<br>  <br>  One of our major vegetarian food companies, Quorn, have recently changed their target audience. Now, they're advertising their food as a 'health food' first, then as vegetarian second.<br>  <br>  Also, I emailed Harribo on numerous occasions to ask them why they put gelatine in their sweets when there are alternatives, and they said it wasn't cost productive.<br>  <br>  THEN, I found that they made a Halal Harribo range, that are vegetarian. There's a bigger market for Muslims than there is for vegetarians, apparently.<br>  <br>  My mum, brother and I are vegetarian.

I can conclude that most are willing to become vegetarians again if the common alternative is dire.<br>  Bottom line -<br>  The lack of 'Victory' grown produce today is proof enough that need to become vegetarians anew has no mandate.|`|BV2N3F8iaa	"Vegetarians are unwittingly eating GM-contaminated food, including certain products which claim they are GM-free.

7kga2aRBaa	omg a friend of a friend of mine had the coolest idea!  well she was gonna do it at this special place, but i think you can do it at home too.  black out like the whole house as much as you can (make sure you put breakable things away)  so the house is like pretty much pitch black.  and then get EVERYBODY to wear white, girls can wear some cute little white dress, guys a white t-shirt, or whatever.  and then just before they go in the house you have a whole lot of glow sticks that you snap or glow in the dark paint and have everybody splattered all over with the glow paint, the more the better.  and then send them in.  it will be so dark but because of the white clothes and the glow paint each person will sort of light up. and you yourself could do something al little different to stand out, like wear a bright neon colored dress(pink,orange,blue etc) and maybe have a different color glow paint so everyone knows your the birthday girl.  you could probably then have small sections of the house lit up where the food and drinks are.  <br>  :) hope i helped<br>  <br>  maybe you could help with mine? haha its like the same question as yours, but im not having a big party, maybe you have some ideas<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308090556AAbX98p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|eFdFPprYaa	A good idea is a song to let your dad no you appreciate him.There's a new song that's perfect for a Sweet 16 Father/Daughter dance.

NBaM0pozaa	I have been asked that question many times. I have been a vegetarian for 7 years. I did an science experiment in science class where i had to dissect a chicken wing. I found out that meat is like muscle. Fish do have muscle. I don not eat fish because of that reason.<br>  (and fish were a living animal)|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Fish are animals. Period.  No one who eats fish is a vegetarian.  <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/whatis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/whatis.html</a><br>  <br>  I think that nonsense is one of the many bizarre things that  comes from organized religion, and that's why it's in peoples' heads to start with...  I remember my grandparents couldn't eat meat at certain times of year for religious purposes, but their church allowed fish on those days.  And I remember hearing stories about how the church would declare some other animals fish so people could eat them during those times too.    So anytime someone said they didn't eat meat to them,  they assumed they ate fish.|`|Tp9aN8mEaa	It is considered as a meat. Because it is rich protein source like red meat and chicken and not only this but also it is more healthy <br>  because it has the minerals.<br>  I am not sure but personally I consider the sea fruites like fish and shrimp as a meat. put in mind that different meats have different contents beside the protein.|`|HmndmCdjaa	As far as vegetarians go, fish is considered a meat.

It's just as dead as a chicken, cow or pig.<br>  <br>  One reason many people do not consider fish to be meat is that Catholics used to give up "meat" for Lent, but were still permitted fish.|`|BV2N3F8iaa	As a generic culinary and butchery term of art, "meat" refers to the muscular flesh of a mammal. This is the definition most commonly applied by governments in meat product regulation and food labeling, and in religious rites and rituals. Edible birds and fish/seafood are not "meat" under this application but are treated separately from mammals. Likewise, amphibians and reptiles, not to mention the "meat" of edible insects, arachnids, and so on.|`|aiKLvwGTaa	I think the explanation for eating fish is that<br>  <br>  1) It's free until it's caught (usually). For me, this was the reason why I used to eat fish<br>  <br>  2) Fish have a lot simpler nerve system than other animals, and so their understanding of pain is not as great.<br>  <br>  3) It's personal preference.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that people should be free to make their own decisions about what they do and do not eat. It's nobody's right to enforce their principles onto anybody else.<br>  <br>  I don't eat fish or meat, but I also don't eat gelatine, cochineal or rennet. If I were to be a true vegetarian, I also wouldn't eat sugar or drink alcohol, as most of it is purified using animal products.<br>  <br>  In the same way, if my doctor prescribes me medication that contains gelatine, I'll still take it.

Q52aWMvcaa	There are some candies out there that are made specifically with rice paper wrappers that are supposed to be eaten along with the candy, but Stride gum is NOT one of these. <br>  <br>  It's made from paper, not rice paper or any other type of material made specifically for consumption. Some people DO eat paper occasionally, but I've also seen people eat toothpicks, glue, and their own nose pickings. Personally, I'm not going to base my eating habits on the minority of folks that get a kick out of eating non-consumption materials. <br>  <br>  I don't know where this myth started. Maybe Stride uses a lot of oil-based flavoring in their gum and it leeches into the paper, inspiring some random person to begin chewing on it when they ran out of the real stuff. I remember as a kid that other children use to sell paper and toothpicks soaked in cinnamon oil. Pretty much the same concept, though unintentional on the part of the Stride manufacturers.<br>  <br>  There's some mention of it on the web, and one blogger actually contacted the makers of Stride to ask them. Here's their response (Btw, the last bit probably has to do with concerns your kid might have Pica...see aforementioned snot, glue, and toothpick eaters):<br>  <br>  While Stride(r) gum is designed to be chewed for a ridiculously long time, our gum wrappers are not. All of our gum wrappers are made with materials that comply with FDA regulations for food contact materials; however, none of our chewing gum wrappers are designed to be ingested. While there’s nothing toxic in them, gum wrappers aren’t intended for ingestion and gum wrappers should not be eaten. Should you have any questions or concerns about your children ingesting gum wrappers, please contact your doctor or other health care professional.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Uhhhh.... no....|`|yDp2hNc5aa	not that I heard of|`|3CBWubtAaa	ya they are i do it all the time<br>  it's a little harder at the start but it all gets soft<br>  it just saves you from holding a little wrapper|`|cti9MtJfaa	my friends and i always ate them while chewing the gum :)<br>  so i guess ya :)|`|FGuzsRpJaa	hahaha no|`|6mNTTYcCaa	Yes!<br>  stride is meant to be chewed with the wrapper. It holds the flavor in until it disintegrates, and then you have your regular gum.<br>  Strides slogan is about it being long lasting.<br>  But, after all, its a preference.Some like it with the wrapper, and some like it oldschool-style. So just try it,because even if you dont like it, in the end all you lost was a piece of gum.<br>  btw I eat all of my stride wrapper and all.

psMZrXa7aa	Chicken is one of the best lean sources of protein you can get and is one that many individuals who are active or who are pursuing competitive fitness or bodybuilding choose to utilize. It's relatively cost effective, easy to prepare and comes in a few different varieties. <br>  Keep in mind however that the variety you choose will differ slightly in nutritional content. <br>  Below is the nutritional information for various boneless chicken pieces (for a three oz serving size). <br>  <br>  Skinless chicken breast - 120 calories, 1.5 grams fat, 24 grams protein<br>  Skinless drumstick - 130 calories, 4 grams fat, 23 grams protein<br>  Breast with skin - 170 calories, 7 grams of fat, 25 grams of protein<br>  Drumstick with skin - 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 23 grams of protein<br>  Skinless chicken Wing - 150 calories, 6 grams of fat, 23 grams of protein<br>  <br>  Whenever possible you're always wisest to eat your chicken without the skin as obviously that is where the majority of the fat is. If you are concerned that having the chicken without the skin will leave it tasteless and dry, consider using a marinate before cooking as this is a great way to add taste and moisture. <br>  Some ideas for marinades would include olive oil (which will provide you will healthy fats), skim milk, low fat yogurt, wine, lemon juice or simply rubbing in some spices such as thyme, basil, rosemary or garlic. These will all add few calories while upping the flavour.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Of course its good for you.

Make sure you have enough space. Or you could put it in a roasting pan with water, cover and put in the oven for a few hours until tender. Then once cooked you can turn the oven down and hold until you are ready for it.
mSPr7nhWaa	blending is when you mix two ingredients together and you can't separate them after ward.  (If you using a solid ingredient, blending it would turn it into a liquid substance).  Grinding is when you crush what ever you're using.  Grating is when you basically scraping off something.  (If you are grating a carrot, you would scrape the outer layer off because it's dusty or whatever).  Mincing is cutting the ingredients into very small pieces.  Whipping is when you beat it into a froth.  Usually with an eggbeater, whisk or fork.|`|BNesPk9yaa	you can find all that info here as well <br>  <br>  The  Cook's Thesaurus <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foodsubs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsubs.com/</a>

jZRtTpZiaa	You cannot force your diet and lifestyle on people.   Tell him about your position,  give him information to back it up like this <a href="http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eatright.org/ada/files/veg.pdf</a>   Then let it drop.  If he's interested, he will come to it in his own time.  It's less likely that he will take you seriously if you keep being a pain in the neck about it.   <br>  <br>  Set a good example as a vegan.  Be a good friend, be a good person, don't constantly annoy the heck out of people, take care of your health, eat right, and lead by that example.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Just lead by example, your obvious better health would have a greater influence than any amount of reasoning|`|b9uOax0aaa	He evidently does not want to listen to you.  Leave him alone.|`|I0Hjx0ahaa	As a vegetarian, I know how you feel. It can be extremely frustrating to explain your views to someone who doesn't agree with the vegetarian lifestyle, especially if they are close friends or family. <br>  <br>  To be honest, your friend is being immature if he will not listen to you respectfully. However, you cannot force him to listen. Some people are just stuck in their ways and will not listen to any new ideas. You just have to "agree to disagree" with people like that, and hope the subject doesn't come up too much.   <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|5oEJuhwiaa	As much as i'd love for all of my friends to become vegetarians like me I would never force or 'influence' them into it. It is a personal decision. Not everyone is going to agree with your lifestyle - friends included. You should let your friend eat whatever he wants to eat. At the end of the day it's his choice not yours. How would you like it if your friend tried to influence you into eating meat? And while a vegetarian diet is healthy it depends on the way you go about eating. A meat diet may be healthier then a vegetarian diet in some cases.|`|Fc81vluraa	if ther yur friends dont anoy them and dont push yur ideas on them when they dont wana hear cos it wil anoy them|`|7AtkwWfwaa	My best friends are vegetarians.

Or if it is a good friend who you know is very sensitive about that then yes.  Otherwise I would just rake it around and disguise the fact I didn't eat it to!|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	I should not think so.  If they don't like it they may say that it was very nice to be polite but they certainly would not ask for second helpings.  If they do then assume that your food is very good and to their liking|`|ezzSeBnLaa	No not usually. You can tell when someone doesn't like something because they'll stall and eat it really slow, maybe push it around a little bit so it looks like they've eaten some of it.|`|W6wamWLLaa	No!! I wouldnt,|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	Suppose it depends on what their idea of being polite is. Usually if I don't like food someone has made I'll say I'm full up but tell them it was nice...unless they're a good friend and would know I was lying :P I'd just say sorry, but I don't think I can eat it all. I wouldn't ask for another helping just to be polite.|`|1gTy1XqXaa	I seriously doubt it....<br>  why would you torture yourself twice?<br>  <br>  If they didnt like your food, they probably wouldn't have even finished the first plate.|`|JoXk9HNuaa	No!<br>  I consider it rude to ask for another plate unless you are offered<br>  So it means someone really really likes your food in my opinion!|`|i4I0cuudaa	unlikely|`|IUlh5pqWaa	Does depend the person, but I know I wouldn't|`|ouzrDPaSaa	It depends on the person.  Personally, if I was trying to be polite but didnt like the food I would force myself to eat what was on my plate but not ask for a second helping!|`|ox85tnblaa	I would hope not. I personally would have more respect for the person who can honestly say "Hey, Wow-That's not your best work." I mean everyone has different tastes, but if I knew myself that it was crappy, and someone gushed about how good it was I would make it again the next time that person came over just to punish them for the lies.
6AYA3GWWaa	Put the hard brown sugar in a bowl.  Wet two paper towels, and put them on top of the sugar.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and microwave for about 45-60 seconds.  After that, you should be able to break the sugar up with a fork (if not, cover it back up and microwave a little longer).|`|7cUDstdjaa	Just warm it in the microwave for a few minutes|`|I8ovm6tPaa	The way that we used to do it was as soon as you open a bag of brown sugar, place a small piece of bread in the bag. Or you could also try macaroni! The idea is that the starchy foods absorb the moisture and the sugar stays grainy. Also, try storing your sugar in a cool dry place that should help a bit too.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Some people say to throw it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds, but I've noticed it hardens up pretty quickly again. I would just put a few apple or bread slices in the container and leave it overnight. If it worked for my old roommates pot, I don't see why it wouldn't work on brown sugar!
sP98NDi5aa	That was blood.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	If the shell was pink and the egg did not smell it would probably be okay.  With eggs you need to be careful, if you have another egg you should probably throw that one away.|`|HmndmCdjaa	i've never heard of the inside of an egg shell being pink.  generally speaking if an egg is bad, you will know it because it will reek, trust me there will be no doubt in your mind.  and sometimes the white part of the egg is a hint of green.  Eggs can last a long time so even if they are expired on the package they will still be good for a while after that.  They are simply fresher and you have a better product prior to the expiration date.

Whisk in the flour, starting a few tablespoons at a time to prevent lumps, them whisk in the sugar, salt, and cardamom.<br>  <br>  Warm a griddle or a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Pour a thin film of oil onto the griddle and add a teaspoon or two of butter. Pour or spoon out the batter onto the hot griddle, where it should sizzle and hiss. A scant 2 tablespoons of batter will make a 3-inch pancake, about as large as you'll want to go with this batter. Because they spread so much, pour the batter out quickly, in one motion, then pause long enough for the previous pancake to firm, so that the cakes don't run into each other. Make as many cakes as you can fit without crowding. (Stir the batter up from the bottom each time you make a cake.)<br>  <br>  Cook the pancakes for about 1 minute, until their top surface is covered with tiny bubbles, like most American pancakes, or until the batter has lost its gloss and turned a couple of shades darker near the outside edges, depending on whether you've used more or less flour, respectively. Flip the pancakes with a thin-bladed spatula and cook until the second side is golden brown, a minute or two longer. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a bit more oil and butter to the griddle as needed. Serve immediately with butter and preserves or fruit.|`|nOVSf06Raa	Here it is <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lunds-Swedish-Pancake-12-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000H25S8U" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Lunds-Swedish-Panc...</a>|`|iHFZLsDTaa	1.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lunds-Swedish-Pancake-12-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000H25S8U" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Lunds-Swedish-Panc...</a><br>  <br>  2.<br>  <a href="http://www.foodlocker.com/83300-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodlocker.com/83300-2.html</a><br>  <br>  3.<br>  <a href="http://www.aumarche.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=store.prodDetail&prodID=501" rel="nofollow">http://www.aumarche.com/index.cfm?fuseac...</a><br>  <br>  4.<br>  <a href="http://www.hemslojd.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?page=HEM/PROD/7939" rel="nofollow">http://www.hemslojd.com/Merchant2/mercha...</a><br>  <br>  5.<br>  <a href="http://www.shopfoodex.com/lunds-swedish-pancake-p-36613.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopfoodex.com/lunds-swedish-...</a>|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	I don't know where you live.<br>  I do know we sold it( we may still do) at one time.<br>  But here's a different site you can buy it from.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ingebretsens.com/details.php?prodID=145" rel="nofollow">http://www.ingebretsens.com/details.php?...</a>

pMFLqU0Yaa	In most places there is no advantage to drinking bottled water. Most bottled water IS tap water! (Aquafina leaps immediately to mind) It's just been bottled for you. Sometimes it's been filtered, but most of us do that with our tap water at home anyway. A major disadvantage to purchased bottled water is the bottle itself. Most people do not recycle them and they lurk about in landfills in the millions.<br>  <br>  Just buy a Brita filter for your tap or a Brita pitcher (which is what I use) and a sturdy, washable plastic bottle to pack your water around in when you leave the house. It will save you tons of money in the end and it's much more earth-friendly.|`|LUumyiHYaa	The bottles used for bottled water are not always recycled, even if you put them in the recycling so is BAD for the environment!

fs8BFZAzaa	i buy organic eggs, milk and chicken. conventional eggs were making me feel sick and i believe the antibiotics the hens were treated with is what was making me feel sick. i have adverse reactions to many antibiotics. with the organic eggs i wasn't getting the sick feeling, that sold me on some organics. if organic food were more affordable i would buy only organic foods.|`|sDKCX43caa	As long as organic remains over priced I will continue to eat conventional foods. <br>  The only times I have had organic was when it was on special, and honestly, it wasn't any better to the taste.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Conventional or Natural but never Organic.<br>  I was a manager for Whole Foods for 4 years.<br>  From what I've seen, I'm totally convinced that it's all b/s.<br>  What they're saying, I'm not buying.<br>  I've seen more items pulled from the shelves of Whole Foods by the FDA, then all the items I've seen pulled off the shelves in conventional markets( combined).( Especially in the Whole Body section, which is a total rip off). Snake oil.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Some of both. I started with organic dairy because I didn't want to send money to Monsanto, the evil corp of all evil corps who makes the bovine growth hormone. Then I had kids and felt good about not giving them hormones. Organic eggs can come with omega-3s and taste a world better than regular eggs.<br>  <br>  Meat in another problem, organic meat is very expensive and it's hard to feed a growing family on what it costs. I do buy organic hamburger and chicken when it's on sale, but for the most part I can't afford it all the time.<br>  <br>  I don't feel as strongly about organic produce for some reason, although I would buy it if the cost was nearly the same.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Organic is very important for liver health. However I can't afford the additional cost in my food budget, otherwise I would buy as much organic food as I could find.  I do buy organic coconut oil, there is hexene in the cheaper brands.|`|AA11402528	conventional.<br>  <br>  eating organic is completely ridiculous and pointless..plus a waste of money|`|77ZVd5hyaa	We buy organic
AA11366224	If it had been custard the way I make it, it would have broken his jaw.|`|f5wTQblsaa	Suits you Sir,|`|JhDDOkb7aa	Put green food colouring in regular custard.
532XA7lkaa	Oatmeal is great, healthy and filling.  Add some maple syrup for some sweetness or stir in some yogurt for a creamy flavor.  Oatmeal keeps your system regular, has lots of fiber and protein for energy to keep your body healthy!|`|7wlrEnGeaa	You can drink milk with coffee and chocolate .
829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Vinegar is the best preservative( and an ingredient).|`|DtB4DlDNaa	Vinegar, pepper or any spice will do.. for more info, try to fing it here - www.freetotaste.com
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I have done it. I personally don't like the taste of mayo but mayo is tons better in spinach dip. But it is doable!!!|`|APNB4OfIaa	Yes, it will work but doesn't taste the same.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Miracle Whoop has a sweet artificial taste compared to mayonnaise, I prefer mayonnaise and will pay the extra money.|`|AA11765580	It will work fine but the taste will be a bit different.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	It works.<br>  It will just make it sweeter.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Yes, it will be fine.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Personally, I wouldn't use Miracle Whip for spinach dip.   I use cream cheese and it's great that way.|`|XYIijuE8aa	it would be slightly sweeter. Put a dash of tabasco sauce to counter act the sweetness or add some sour cream
cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and buy Knorr fish stock cubes,also you can add bottled clam juice, even poach some fish and make it yourself, making it is not hard, as fish stock is done in 1 hour, longer and the bones breakdown and go mushy making the stock cloudy.<br>  <br>  The jarred paste is nice to, but for a richer taste a combination is a mix of the cubes, stock paste and clam juice.|`|XYIijuE8aa	If you can not find fish stock or do not want to boil up a fish yourself then just use vegetable stock .|`|39pbRLC2aa	any food store|`|m5WRne9Eaa	any store it should come in jars.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	I'm sure you will be able to find it in jars at your supermarket.
