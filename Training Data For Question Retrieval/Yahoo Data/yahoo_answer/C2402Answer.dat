lPxVt2XYaa	Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social and Democratic Labour Party, which later became the Bolshevik party.  He led the October Revolution in Russia, becoming the first communist leader of the USSR.    Lenin was a Marxist, so his ideas were based on the ideas of Karl Marx.  These ideas include the notion that the workers should own the means of production, that the employers exploit the workers, that history can be viewed as a progression of the relationship between people and capital (money & finance) - from feudalism to capitalism then socialism and finally communism and that each stage is "inevitable".  Lenin's main contribution to the development of Marxist ideas was to claim that stages of history could be "telescoped".  He argued that because Russia had had a capitalist, bourgeoisie, government from March to October 1917 then that would count as the capitalist stage, and that the Russian workers, through their vanguard - the Communist Party, were able to rapidly progress towards the socialist stage of development.

PuqVhzY9aa	I think the idea of Equality could most definitely be taken too far.  There's just a lot more to life than trying to bring order to society by treating every single person as absolutely equal without any exceptions.    The way I look at it, if the issue of equality were based on morals, then here's how my thought process runs down.. If one were wanting to treat everyone the same way, then it is a good and also a bad thing.  It's good because he or she may be courteous to every single person they know(or be indecisive or argumentative with every single person, depends on how they want to equally treat everyone), but the backlash of that would be how to distinguish between family/friends and co-workers/school buddies, or even how to approach someone who is anti-social or an all-around jerk.  By trying to treat everyone as equals, that person's most-loved-ones would eventually, inevitably, have to feel a little distant at some point and a whole bunch of other issues would just come along with it.      I personally think it's a good idea to treat everyone equally when it comes to nationality, sex, religion, politics, and other famed traits that most people tend to generalize either for the better or for worse.  But, there's a lot more to morals than just equality, so to sum this part of my answer up, I think it can be taken too far on a personal level and would not be beneficial to anyone in the long run.    As for a broader take on Equality, I think it can also be taken too far if society or even the entire human race were treated exactly the same.  As a few have already touched on, it could lead to communism or other not-as-extreme consequences.  We're already seeing a few of those consequences in our current society.    For instance, a well-known ISSUE(in my opinion) is the fact that everyone is assigned a social security number which, in general, replaces your full name, date of birth, age, race, and every other detail about you.  People have let this issue evolve.  Schools assign "Student ID Numbers," and beyond that, many schools are adopting the use of a "School Lunch Card" which substitutes for cold-hard cash somewhat similar to a debit card.  This card, however, also houses a number that abbreviates the holder's full name and other account information.    A lot of these numbers can't be avoided due to the growing population of the United States and the world at large, but there can be measures taken to avoid anymore labels that are being placed on every single precious human being.  Otherwise, we may as well just go ahead and get that chip implanted into our skulls that could, in theory, be scanned as a bar code whenever you leave a store or board an airplane that automatically charges your bank account or automatically determines if you're a ticket holder and if you're allowed to board the plane, and several other(while arguably useful) harmfully "equal" scenarios.|`|RuLPI7CEaa	Yes, it does go to far.

True equality can not be forced, as it is with regards to law. I'm not implying that there ISN'T equality, I'm saying that by forcing it, it perpetuates the negative notions that were motivation to establish the laws in the first place. It DIVIDES.     This is not an argument against affirmative action, as I've yet to come up with a better alternative. Oppression can't be denied, nor ignored by the oppressed.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	No.|`|2Ko12Elfaa	Yes.  Absolute equality is monotonous.  If it were applied to society, you might as well be living in a bee colony.  Applied in general, well... how would anything have a relative value?  Can you imagine doing math when all terms are equal?

We are the master of this world From the highest of the Norths to the lowest of the Lows we shall become many. The very earth shakes beneathe our feet, Like our God who has created us we are no different for we Create and what we create we can Destroy. As a human I do not live by emotions for they are cloudy and brings about regret, We are creatures of incredible love our Understanding of everything is amazing, whether its math or science there is no limit to what we can achieve. We exist to Serve, and Give thanks and Credit to our Creator who is so kind to make us from nothing into something. Are we so different from god? If a toaster breaks on us Do we not try to fix it? and if the toaster cannot be fixed Do we not destroy it and get another one? What we are, What you see, and What you feel is our world.

iT9S20zvaa	Ray Bradbury is an American author who has plenty of classics out (Fahrenheit 451, Something Wicked This Way Comes--the 2 most well known).  I'm sure there are plenty of critic reviews for his books.  His books are not lengthy (Fahrenheit 451 is pretty short) and they have a neat style to them.  He is one of my favorite authors.    Another American novelist (another of my favorites...) is Kurt Vonnegut.  He also has classics: Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, Hocus Pocus, etc.  There should be a lot of critic reviews for him as well.  As for the length of his books, I don't really remember.  They aren't overly long.  You can check the number of pages on amazon.    I think I saw that someone had already mentioned To Kill a Mockingbird.  It is written by Harper Lee (also American), the book is only about 281 pages long, and it is an amazing book so I definitely second the recommendation.  You can bet there are dozens of critic reviews for this one.    The only reason I recommend these books and authors (other than the fact that they fit your criteria) is that I would have liked someone to have recommended them to me.  They are all considered classics (are well deserving of the titles) and I enjoyed every them.     I hope you find something that, while still part of a school assignemt, you are able to like.  Good luck.|`|AA10449300	Well, I don't know how well these books will work for an English essay... But they are really good. You should read them.     The Katie Parker Production Series:   By: Jenny B. Jones    Act 1: In Between    Act 2: On The Loose    Act 3: The Big Picture    These have become my favorite books. They are about a girl who's mom is a drug addict and who's dad is a no-show. Anyway, she ends up in foster care and when she's sent to live in In Between, Texas with her new foster family, she does everything she can to get sent back. She gets in with the wrong group of kids at school and ends up in quite a bit of trouble. A tornado hits the town, so her crazy foster grandmother moves into her bedroom which of course she doesn't like. But she does eventually learn to love her foster family. And when her mom comes back in the third book, she ends up back with her foster family because her mother gets back on drugs and isn't treating her well.     They're all really great books. I highly recommend them.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Try something by Donald E. Westlake.  The Hot Rock might be a good choice.

I've seen things like:    able to drive stick shift, able to juggle, good photographer, able to paint well, great with animals, etc.     you never know what they're looking for and if a casting director can't use you for the job you're auditioning for, he might have another project where your talents would fit in well.|`|bF4HAvsZaa	No.    Your resume should have your statistics and contact information and your acting experience:  Play/movie Title-Role-Theater/Production Company    Special skills (Musical instruments,juggling, gymnastics etc.)    Training:  Schools  Workshops    Do not put in anything like, "I'm really good at learning lines and people say I'm a great actress."

30RlXHX3aa	I'm pretty sure, if you're a minor, you must have a court order must be appointed for you to change your last name and I think your Mother or legal gaurdian must do it because of your age. The court will only order this if it's in the child's best interest. Sorry I couldn't be of more help but I would suggest going with your Mom to your local Court House to find out for sure the exact steps that must be taken.    EDIT: Here I found this http://www.uslegalforms.com/wv/WV-NAME-2...  and   This How do I change my name if I am a minor?   To change the name of a minor, one or both of the legal parents may petition the circuit court for the city/county in which you live. The petition must be made under oath and state the place of residence of the minor, the names of both parents, including the maiden name of the mother, the date and place of birth of the minor, the minor's felony conviction record, if any, whether the minor is presently incarcerated or a probationer with any court, and if the minor has previously changed their name, those former names must be listed. Also, the applicant must affirm that the name change is not sought with any fraudulent intent and that the name change is in the best interest of the minor. A filing fee must be paid at time the petition is filed.     Both legal parents must agree to the proposed name change. If only one parent files the petition, notice must be given for the other parent to respond at a hearing before the court. The name change does not terminate any legal parental rights     I found that on the Virginia's Judicial system website. I realize it's for Virginia but hopefully it will be of some help, I couldn't find anything for WV but I'll keep looking.

hvbZqKivaa	Maybe you understand something from this;    The Raven     The Raven written by Edgar Allan Poe is a very famous poertry.  "The most obvious symbol is the Raven its self.  Poe uses the non-reasoning  raven because he wants to make us wondering why he had chosen the raven from   all the other birds., and frustrate us by wondering why the raven is   repeating the word nevermore. He is  surprised to hear the bird speak and he thinks that no living human has  ever had a bird just sit there and talk to him, and with such a name as  Nevermore. This might be the point where he realises that he is dying.  It   is also important that the answers to the questions are already known, but in a   way it helps to illustrate the self-torture the narrator exposes himself to.  Another symbol is the Pallas. . It seemed that the bird had a purpose for   being there.  In the whole room the raven decides toperch on the Greek   Goddess of Wisdom, because in a way or another he is  trying  to make us  believe that the raven speaks from wisdom? Or was Poe just  using a word only some could interpret? "And the Raven, never flitting,   still is sitting, still is sitting On  the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have  all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er  him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out  that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted NEVERMORE."  Through this quotation the bird has disobeyed him and is just sitting above   the  door staring at him. His soul is caught under the bird shadow as he  passes away and it is lifted up to heaven and his fair Lenore.     Poe uses midnight and December for the time the story takes place because   both represent an end to something, and alsothe anticipation of something   new. A new year comes after midnight,  also a new day; and December represents the end of a year. Finally  when I picture the room the narrator is positioned in and  remembering the  past, remembering how weak and weary he felt. He remembers himself  he was like a lonely  and sorrowful, and the richly furnished room reminds   him of his lost love,  Lenore. And the tempest (storm) outside shows more of his isolation,  and is a contrast between the calmness of the chamber and the  tempestuous night. I believe Poe put no moral in " The Raven", but his  stories were more like puzzles that he wanted people to poke and pry at  , and in the end to accomplish nothing. He has accomplished his goals  by making many Poe readers go a little insane by trying to figure out the  logic of his insane stories. In summary of this poem I get a feeling of a   lonely old man who would  accept death until he comes face to face with it, where he fights with all  his remaining strength to survive. He issurprised to hear the bird speak and   he thinks that no living human hasever had a bird just sit there and talk to   him, and with such a name as  Nevermore. This might be the point where he realises that he is dying.
1lLGYQ6Waa	I'm very glad some people are thinking about Improving and Strengthening themselves. People in general don't care there perception of life is based around what is external, They love the things that do not help themselves. Finding wisdom and the using the power that is bestowed within your body and the techniques of the mind is a very great path to follow. For this one question you asked i can see you have found a path few have walked, and fewer still Understand.    By Desire I'm presuming you mean "Want" like something you want desperately, which is quite right people want to make things easier but what they dont' realize is what makes there lives easier also makes them weaker! We like the Creator that created all things also Create things to serve us in our own ways, and since what we make are very fragile and break there is always room for improvement which hungers people to achieve more then what has already had.

I wear a little bit of make up to conventions, like cover up (not liquid) masara (waterproof) and liquid eyeliner (also water proof). Keep it to the basics and keep it looking classy not only to show professionalism but to boost confindence and to keep from looking like the clown with masraca pooring down her face!|`|8pDblyCBaa	wear very light and not a lot of heavy powder since you'll be sweating like a fag|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	I usually just stick to some waterproof mascara.

And I think so many people hate them because so many people love them. They get 'tired' of hearing about them, so they decide to hate them. Without even reading them which, might I add, is quite dumb, because they're amazing! They're wonderfully written, and a great story. Just read them and give it a try (: If you end up hating it like you do now, you can go ahead and throw them in the garbage. What do you have to lose? They don't take that long to read. Your friends don't have to know. Please! Just read them! :D|`|IUQZFrMfaa	i love them. although i agree with the first person. i hate the fan base. too many people are making WAY too much money off something that wasn't even their idea. The fake Cullen crests, Bella's bracelet, secret "insider's" guides... etc. i just wish people would stop being soo.... OBSESSED! i mean, its fine if you genuinely love the books (like i do), but buying worthless, stupid stuff to support you love isn't going to do anything. except waste your money. because in 1 year when the rush dies down, you're gonna just dump that bracelet with the wooden wolf and heart crystal. sorry to burst your bubble.

GQzg7HTmaa	aro: can read minds, but only if he touches them, edward only see's what people are thinking at that momemnt, aro will see every thing they have been through and everything they have ever thought.    Jane: is short and looks innocent and young. jane has a power that can incappacitate someone, its an illusion that will make on think they are suffering great amounts of pain.     Alec: janes brother, creates another illusion the complete oppisite of janes, he makes incapacitates someone, but they will see, hear, or feel anything they describe it as a think fog that they use when they have to execute someone.    Demitri: is the huge, much like emmett, he is the greatest tracker in the world.     Reneta: is a "sheild" for aro, she blocks things from him, she will be better explained in breaking dawn, you dont need to know about her now.     i'm pretty sure i've covered all of them.    enjoy the books, there magnificent :D|`|87VlHRIyaa	Jane:  Torture people with her mind : Like hurt them     Aro can read minds, but only if he touches them, and he doesn't just hear what they're thinking at that moment, he hears everything they've ever thought.|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	Aro - Can read a person's mind, but must make contact.

Demetri has a sense for finding peole's scents. Like an amazingly proficent tracker.  Aro can read every thought your mind has had (with physical interaction).    I dont exactly remember the rest, or they don't mention them, but I'm pretty sure Marcus and Caius also have extra powers. So does Heidi (the "bait" from New Moon) and Felix.

It is not a romance; it has a romantic relationship as part of the story but it is about a writer who returns to the town of his youth and discovers evil has always dwelt in the town but now it's much worse.     There is no idea about vampires being good in any sense. They are pictured as entirely evil beings. Having said that you will still find it suspenseful and down-right scary.
AA12343309	A lot of us Gaels have it.  My father had lots of skin cancers removed.  I had so many precancerous lesions on my face that the dermatologist prescribed Efudex Cream for it.  It is a chemo treatment.  If you have seen pictures of people with radiation burns, that is what I looked like for about a month and it wasn't too comfortable.    I have a nose that is quite common among the Scots and Irish.  It is a somewhat upturned nose with a little bulb on top.  When I was young that little bulb stayed red all the time.  Then the song "Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer" came out and I was accused of being the inspiration for it.    I think your term reddish skin can be misleading.  People use to call Native Americans "redskins."  In their dark tone skin people saw a hint of red.  However, theirs isn't thin like the Gaels.|`|rupdyyezaa	Native Americans.    Brazilians

If you mean to get a digital amp (like Line 6) you should get a 75, if not more. Of course, louder pickups will mean a louder sound, but generally the suggestions above should work.|`|JZwklgFSaa	Ideally you need 100watt output for the places you go to,   you might think that a lot of watts but you can always turn  it down but with 50watts you cannot turn it up if the power is  not there. Make sure your speakers match, or get a good  combo. Theres  plenty of second hand gear about so get looking  Where you are going I have already been. Good luck|`|FViagGVEaa	75 watts should be good, but you will only need 30 watts if you are micing your amp (Putting a mic in front of your amp, and the mic goes into the PA system)|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	If you want a good 30 watt amp...    check out    Vox , Randall, or Marshall    ...they are about $250    www.music123.com|`|oweQc1OBaa	a 30 watt amp should do good. like other people said, just turn it up. and mic it. http://www.guitarcenter.com/Ibanez-TBX30...     good luck and hope this helps!!|`|TM3zpfoPaa	Well actually any amp can play gigs. When I started out I used a 15 watt Sammick Amp and I just miced it.    Now if you do not plan to mic anything just use a 120 watt amp, Combo will also work.    I still am a big fan on just using mics to sound louder. Less stuff to carry around.|`|LWbfPPCvaa	yea man 30 watts should do fine. jus mike it. and put the volume up.

4Q9dHbmCaa	These are some excellent twilight quotes -     "Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars --points of light and reason....And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything"    That's a beautiful literary metaphor, perfect for a report.     There's also the famous "And so the lion fell in love with the lamb."     Probably not much use in a report but I love "Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand... "    Renee said: "There's something strange about the way you two are together... the way he watches you- it's so... protective. like he's about to throw himself in fromt of a bullet to save you or something"    and "Sleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love. "  A sweet Edward quote, totally shows how much he loves her.    *"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational. And I have no problem with saving you, either  if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger that I'm the reason that you're here." -Edward Cullen  *"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose." -Bella Swan    In New Moon:  *"So maybe this is hell. I don't care. I'll take it." - Edward Cullen  *"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy." - Edward Cullen    In Eclipse: I have a few faves..  *"There's something... strange about the way you two are together... The way he watches youit's so... protective. Like he's about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something."  Renee Dwyer  *"Do you ever think that your life might be easier if you weren't in love with me?"  Edward Cullen  *"Besides... the more time I spend with you, the more human emotions seem comprehensible to me. I'm discovering that I can sympathize with Heathcliff in ways I didn't think possible before."  Edward Cullen    In Breaking Dawn: my favorite will always be that last line..  "And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever."    ..as you can see, I usually like Edward's lines because they tend to be with deeper meanings! I LOVE IT..    =d|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	This has been asked before you should research before you ask.|`|aygUtJ1Raa	Flip to any page in the book; I'm sure you'll find tons.|`|0xmXrOnZaa	Damn it Bella, you'll be the death of me!

0LgpcOBDaa	As said here, it IS a question of what YOU do with the camera. Not that one camera can do it better than the other, but YOU using the camera to it's full potential and not wearing it around your neck like a big ol' piece of - Hey, look at me bling bling..The images made for web work or hard copy can not be told apart. I beg anyone to be able to tell which camera did what images.    A good question could be why people picked what camera make they did, over the gazillion out there...?! And why..?    I picked Nikon back in the late 60's when it WAS one of the best, hands down. It WAS the camera of choice during the Viet Nam war and was also the pick at the end of the Korean War. It WAS more sound, robust and the lenses were sharper and had more contrast than almost anyone else of the time. Leica was very good, but the German engineering kept the camera from being a "in the dirt and trenches" kind of camera. There were others too, but again, while quality was supreme, the cameras were 'fragile'.. The Nikon's then could be used to frame a house..!    Nikon came up with a lens to body mount called the F mount. This mount has not changed since the day of it's birth. It is over 50 years old. EVERY other manufacture of cameras, in this class, have changed their mount at least once. Canon changed theirs in mid stream and left hundred's of thousand's of devoted Canon users in the dust and cold when they did. The older FD mount was dropped and the new EOS mount adopted. The two would never cross pollinate. People who had ten's of thousands of $$ sunk into high end Canon FD lenses and bodies were not left with even a mint on their pillow.    This brings us back to Nikon. Any lens, bellows, microscope, telescope adapter and any other accessory ever made to fit on the front of a Nikon body, will more than likely fit today. Few exceptions. There has been more lenses made, by anyone, to fit the F mount than any other. The chances to find old, but very good lenses, almost anywhere, are actually in your favor. Some of these lenses command a King's Ransom price even today.     A lot of it today boils down to - looks.. The look of the camera. Which one is "sexy" to you or gives your eyes the candy wanted or needed. As said, images alone anymore are just as hard to tell apart as in the film daze. This battle will rage on and on as long as there is black n white, good and bad..... and Canon or Nikon....    Bob - Tucson|`|bocePfyYaa	No system is the hands down winner when it comes to cameras. Nikon, Canon, Sony, Olympus and Pentax are all well-known and respected camera manufacturers. They all have their strengths and weaknesses.    Lesser known top-quality camera manufacturers are a great option too, but are generally far more expensive: Leica, Hasselblad, Mamiya to name a few.    What really matters is that a camera system works for you. When looking to get a DSLR, rather than ask what other people think, you need to do your own research and decide which brand offers the best in the features that matter to you. You need to hold it in your hand and see what feels right, and play around with the settings and the buttons and the menu to see which has the interface that you like.    You might be surprised by some of the underdogs offerings. Nikon and Canon are not the only two camera manufacturers making DSLRs. Nor are they the only ones making professional DSLRs.    edit-For someone who implied that Nikon and Canon are the only real contenders, I just want to share this bit of info: In the scant three/four years they have been in the DSLR business, Sony has edged out past Pentax and Olympus. They are third among the three most popular. Tomorrow, who knows, one day they might be number one.|`|n71t0xoCaa	I think one will edge technically ahead of the other for a short while and then the other will push forward to take the lead. Thye are both great cameras and the competition benifits us the users. Since they are always competing for top spot we get better stuff. I think Canon originally took the lead in digital, right now I think Nikon has caught and has an advantage particularly in low light performance. I do not expect things to stay that way I am sure the canon folks are plotting as we speak to change that. You cannot change each time one or the other takes the lead unless you have far far more money than most of us. So we pick one and stay loyal and when we have the upper hand gloat to our friends that have the other brand knowing they will return the favor when thier brand is on top.    Yes there are other good cameras but those two brands have stayed top of the heap for a good while for a reason. Build quality, taking care of thier customers and a constant push for improvement.    That said you know I love my Nikons|`|dj4Q3XTlaa	Nathan,    your right, it's an opinion , not a fact.  I've owned both and you can't go wrong with either.

Colgate, or Aqua Fresh?  They both clean your teeth, and are both ADA approved.  Who knows...........maybe the tooth fairy, for sure.  But a debate is pointless.  As a nikon user, I prefer nikon.  I have used canon and I do not care for its interface.  Despite my dislike of its ergonomics, canon does the same thing nikon does.  It's a preference.|`|AA12323486	Yes, Nikon is better than Canon and Canon is better than Nikon.    (Well, that is the way you worded your question!)    They're both up there.  You can't go wrong with either.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	i have a lot of friends here in kansas that shoot with canon, and won't touch a nikon  and i have some friends that shoot with nikon and won't touch a canon.   and i have a couple of friends that have Lycra but will also use either a canon or a nikon or a pentax or an olympus or a Mamiya...  i shoot with olympus mostly, have a 35 mm nikon which we use sometimes...and i used to have a 35mm pentax that took one heck of a beating from me and kept right on clicking...  i think it's what ever glass you like is the camera you'll use...or whatever feels right in your hand. or in my case, what you can afford. what ever will give you the most bang for the buck at the time.|`|7AxLSwrPaa	Well, I have the Canon EOS 50D, and it's my pride and joy. I've never owned a Nikon, but I've operated them before. I'm not quite sure if you're asking about more professional cameras or standard digital cameras, but from my experience, Canon is better. There's an easier and more functional user interface, and it seems to be the choice of a lot more photographers. So if you're looking at SLRs and such, I'd definitely go with Canon. But on the other hand, if you're just looking at a typical, 150 dollar recreational camera, they're probably interchangeable.|`|5M0FBU89aa	I'm sure some Canon products are better than some Nikon products, and vice-versa.    It's what you *do* with the equipment that matters.    Just buy carefully.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	In all the research I've tirelessly read, I'm going to say it really comes down to the lenses.  The cameras handle and feel a little different, but are virtually the same monster.  The lenses, mechanics and pricing seem to be the only substantial difference I could find.    Canon's (not a blanket statement, just at the ones I happened to look at), often focused a little faster than the Nikon competition.  They were many times in various places priced a little better as well.    I am a Nikon fan, and have all a mixture of Nikon and Hoya products.      Summing it up, look at the capabilities of the body make sure you get what you want there, but really compare the higher end lens performance.  Sometimes one is better than the other, but it's definitely not something that can be said for each companies entire product line.     *walks away .02 cents lighter*

Do this to each  part of the picture that you want to  want to have differnt size dot`s one part of the picture at a time. This is how to use the path tool with gimp.Click on the path tool in your tool box use it to in-close the part of the picture that you want to use. The path tool will leave a lot of little dot`s around the part that you want to change. After you in-close the part that you want to be change go to your keyboard and push the Ctrl button to close the path then go to select click on it a drop down box will come up click on from path in the box.If you want change two or more part`s than click on the dot`s that path tool make`s and in-close the other`s part`s that you want to make change but don`t click on the first dot or the last dot that the path tool make`s or it won`t work click on one of the dot`s in-between the first and last dot`s that the path tool make`s. Do this for each path that you make. Or you can some time`s go to filter`s > noise and play around with HSV Noise or Hurl or RGB noise.

However, just from the first line - why are you capitalising words like rays, morning sun and face?  They are not proper nouns or the beginning of a sentence so do not need capital letters.  And if it is the 'rays' of the morning sun then they would 'catch' your face not 'catches'.    And that's just from the first sentence...    EDIT:  I've just re-read the above, and it sounds really harsh...

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    Each model and make of harp has its particular set of strings     A 36-string folk harp will commonly be strung with the bottom 3-8 bass strings in wire, the lower middle strings in wound nylon, and the top 3+ octaves in monofilament nylon.    Usually, we use gut strings onthe first 5 octave. For the following 3 octave, we use Bass wire strings.    Hope that helps....|`|xnVTRGmyaa	Left-T is Right!   The materials that harp strings are made from varies along the range of the harp, and each model of harp will be different from harps made by other makers, or of other sizes.  My 32-string Dusty Strings lever harp is strung like this:  The bottom four strings are phosphor-bronze wrapped with nylon;  the next six strings are nylon core wrapped with nylon;  the rest is nylon monofilament of varying gauges.  Gut can be used, of course; it has a warm and rich sound, with good sustain, but it breaks more easily than nylon, and is more susceptible to sudden changes in temperature or humidity. It is pretty expensive compared to nylon, but some harp players are willing to spend the extra money for the fuller sound.  Traditional clrseach-style harps (Scottish or Irish) are strung with wire made from brass, bronze, or even silver and gold for their bass strings. Wire harps are played with long nails, rather than the pads of your fingers; they produce a lovely sustained ringing sound, but need to be damped as one plays, because the sound gets muddy pretty quickly.

R5UIMBvcaa	They seem at first to be friends.  As they leave the stage after their encounter with the witches, it's easy to imagine them laughing and even playfully punching each other in the shoulder over the predictions.  "You shall  be King!'  "Your descendants shall be kings!" Ha ha ha ha ha!.      However, I think they begin to grow apart very soon--like in the next scene, where they learn that Macbeth IS Thane of Cawdor and begin to realize that the witches knew something.  Macbeth. in particular, begins to draw into his own dark thoughts when Duncan proclaims Malcolm his heir, and he seems not to think of Banquo again until Act III, Scene 1, when he reflects, probably in an ironic tone, "For Banquo's issue have I [de]fil'd my mind," etc., and proceeds immediately to his conference with the two murderers.      Meanwhile, Banquo has come to have serious misgivings about Macbeth: at the beginning of the same scene, he reflects, "Thous hast it now--King, Cawdor, Glamis, all/As the weird women promis'd; and I fear/Thou play'dst most foully for't . . . ."   Despite his distrust of Macbeth, however, and his own thoughts that his descendants may indeed be kings, he frankly answers Macbeth's questions about where he's going and whether Fleance is going with him.  Even though he suspects Macbeth of foul play in the death of Duncan, it apparently never crosses his mind until too late that Macbeth might be dangerous to him and his son as well.  In fact, he may never realize that fact, since he dies so quickly that he has time only to shout for Fleance to get away.  Possibly he dies thinking that Macbeth, murderer of Duncan or not, is still his friend.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Macbeth    Macbeth Plugged  an annotated, on-line version of the Shakespearean tragedy    http://library.thinkquest.org/2888/    Study Guides:     http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/mac/    http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ma...    http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMacb...|`|MMGKVtVVaa	Macbeth and Banquo were friends at the beginning of the story.  But when they are both together one day, the 3 evil witches come and tell them their prophesy.  They tell Macbeth he will be king and they tell Banquo he will be the father of a series of Kings. Upon hearing this, Macbeth becomes anxious for his prophesy to come true.  So, he decides to kill the current King of Scotland, Duncan.  Macbeth then takes over the throne.  But suddenly, Macbeth starts to worry that Banquo's son or Banquo will take over his throne.  Macbeth decides to hire 3 murderers to kill Banquo and his son.  The murderers kill Banquo, but his son escapes.  Later on in the book the character named Macduff kills Macbeth and Malcolm, son of Duncan, becomes King.  You could assume that in the future Banquo's son will become King and Banquo's prophesy come true.|`|suxCcXkAaa	Macbeth and Banquo are real foils--they're both present at the Weird Sisters' prophecy, but go about it in different ways. While Macbeth is willing to feed the elements of the prediction, Banquo is more of the thinking-before-doing school.    This compares and contrasts the two guys nicely: http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...    And will tell you what's up for their future together.

Other suggestions are Henry Jame's The Portrait of a Lady, anything by Edith Wharton, or Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities (the only one of his novels besides A Christmas Carol that I liked).

yOK32PM9aa	A dystopia is a kind of imaginary world or regime which is bad - the opposite of a Utopia.  The idea is often to get us thinking about our real world and government, and throw light upon the way we actually live.    For this reason, my favourite contrast with 1984 is Huxley's "Brave New World".  Both are by English authors, so there are some parallels.  It is more about science - Huxley was interested in the scientific advances of his day and there are early references to what we would now term cloning, as well as mind control through psychological conditioning, and eugenics.  Orwell was more concerned with geo-politics and what looks in hindsight like the Cold War; Huxley is interested in personal life.  Whereas "Big Brother" in 1984 uses repression to control citizens, the government in BNW uses consumption, free sex, and drugs.  By giving people what they desire, they are turned into happy obedient citizens.  Far more scary.|`|AA12098193	It's the antonym of a utopia, that is, the depiction of a place or world in which desired traits have disappeared. 1984 is one of the most well known dystopias, a place where human values have fallen under the needs of a power elite capable of any sort of manipulation of reality.  Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451 are the most common mates of 1984 in a dystopian library, mainly because they come from English speaking writers, but also because the main characters are "unfit" people, that is, people that see things the way we would, but are surrounded by those who see things otherwise.|`|qdlmy4l8aa	Basically, the OPPOSITE of a utopia.     Brave New World would be easiest to compare with 1984.     Though, I do love me some A Clockwork Orange.     (Obviously)  |`|xMqgB2GDaa	To answer the subject, a dystopia is the opposite of utopia. Dystopia is where the world or realm is full of divisiveness, chaos, and/or strife. Any of these might fit that mold, but the term dystopia is used more typically in a constructed realm, not a real world story. Most of these Sci-Fi novels would work for a comparison, but none really fit well into what I think of when somebody says "dystopia". I might think Dante's Inferno would be a better dystopia...while you may not have the option of doing that, I enjoyed reading Hitchikers guide the most out of those. Lots of comedy built in to lighten the rather stark oddly dismal events, like the world being blown up to make way for a space highway.    So long!

Every action of a "rational" human being is in some way (whether indirectly or not) taken to advance its own happiness. (really think about it, this is actually true). When people consistently act irrationally we say that they are insane - it is knowing that some people act like this that depresses me.|`|jiMAtaCraa	No it doesn't, because whatever deed an individual does, he/she gets a return. It is an inevitable scenario of cause and effect.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Well it's depressing only if you see it that way, but it's very rarely that you'll find somebody that has altruistic qualities and will only care about pleasing you. You just have to be a realist and realize that most relationships have a self-pleasing quality as a basis. Even people who are friends - ARE friends because they give each other the things they need. If you had a friend that refused to support you and listen to you and care about you or give you whatever else it is you need from a friend, then you probably wouldn't call them a friend, right? It's like that in every relationship. It's just that people need to find the balance in their relationship and not just take. They need to give as well.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	That is not true but it is a good thing is that we are blessed when we bless others. Sometimes not right away.

5XJ3Nu8aaa	SG all the way. Les Pauls are heavy, have a lot of unnecissary stuff on them, are way overrated, cost more than their SG counterparts for the same quality, you can't get past the 19th fret, and even if you don't care about any of that, every major band I can think of has someone who plays a LP, so there isn't a whole lot of individuality. SGs are just awesome all the way around. Any given SG (besides the special faded) could beat any given Les Paul.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	Both are fine guitars.  Les Pauls will have a warmer tone because of the body thickness, but are also very heavy for a guitar. The single cutaway also makes it a bit more of a strain to play the last 4 or 5 frets.    The SG is lighter, has double cutaways so it's easier to play higher up. The tone will be a bit thinner, but still good. For  metal, hard rock it's a great guitar.  Les Pauls are good for rock , blues and jazz.    SG's will probably cost a little less than a Les Paul as well.

Depends for what, if you plan on playing metal, I would recommend an Ibanez, if you plan on playing rock I would recommend a Gibson or Fender, if you want something just to start out with I'd say Epiphone, if you want an acoustic, I would say Washburn|`|f2uqEIksaa	nah thats good.  if u want to go all out you should buy a Gibson guitar.|`|JWCUUxlkaa	Washburn acoustic guitars are excellent, I've got on that has a built in tuner, and can be plugged into an amp. It costed around $400.|`|vOjSr0Yhaa	ibanez is a good brand    it depends what guitar you wnat  like if your a beginner you want a not-so-pricey guitar  if your intermediate  then you want a good guitar around 300-500  and so-on    but yes that is a o.k. price for acoustic

GtxnGKoAaa	Acting for film and acting on the stage are two completely different styles of acting.  film acting is far more sutler and less nuanced than acting for the stage.For instance an arched eyebrow could be detected on film but not in the last row of the theater.Most actors master acting for the theater (stage) before they have the opportunity to act in films.What type of actor do you want to become? Are you an internal actor or an external actor or a combination? If you can't answer these questions you probably should take a basic stage acting course. Acting is very psychological as well so you need to know yourself. Hope that helps.|`|AVYUwkftaa	acting 1 :)

AA10015648	Technically, books don't have ratings... only online fan fiction stories have ratings like that.    K = the only conflict is very innocent - no drugs, sex, kissing, and not a lot of violence... think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - there might be death but it happens away from the main character's eyes    K+ = might have a death - but nothing gory or traumatizing. A kiss is fine. No making out. Fights are okay, even bleeding, but no realistic weapon-fighting with knives or guns...     T = making out, realistic fighting, but doesn't have long explanations of sex or gore. Some drugs, but not huge addictions or a glorification of drugs.    M = Sex, gore, drugs... anything you want (within the allowances of the site you're posting on)|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Books have ratings?    ...I don't think so.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	kissing :o booze :o light drug use :o

QK4r41Hqaa	I wanted something happy after finishing it XD   So, I ended up with Minami-ke    other series like death note... hmm not many, but have you tried Vampire Knight? I know it's a shojo- and it'll seem like a bland "love triange" at first. The only reason I kept reading it at first was because of the pretty art, acually.  After a few chapters it gets REALLY intence. (The latest chapter... well, Kaname's hand was CUT OFF :|  ... It's not grown back yet >_>... it will, right? right?)  And there's a ton of action fights, with really awesome sceens latter on.      also stuff that's good: Soul Eater- it's getting really main stream (VK is too) but it's acually pretty good.    Doubt (not to be confused with Doubt!!! (one has !!! one doesn't))  It's a thriller, kinda like SAW but... a manga.   a bunch of kids are stuck in some place, and one of them is killing the others off. Find the Wolf in a group of Rabbits, the wolf is discised as a rabbit, but eating the rabbits at night.  It's also known as Rabbit Doubt (don't worry, there's people in it, not rabbits)  It's really amazing, very thrilling. The clif hangers are kinda annoing, and it's issued monthly... but it's really great.      Boys Next Door  really twisted, there's shoune-ai in it... I don't remember strong yaoi, but it... um... might be in there. It's definatly mature, but I'm pretty sure there's nothing like graphic sex in it.    Count Cain  by the same author as Boys Next Door (also as Angel Sanctuary and Fairy Cube. that you probably heard about)    Again, small hints and tidbits of shounen-ai. but only enough to make you start to wonder. Nothing bad in here at all.  It's so wonderful! Sad... but wonderful.    (Vampire Knight, Doubt, Boys Next Door, Count Cain)  The closest to DN ould be Doubt and Count Cain    edit: oh how could I forget Code:Geas????  It really was quite similar, haha. I really can't believe I forgot about it|`|q1ui0cS0aa	Vampire Knight???  Umm... Shugo Chara??  (Those are just my personal faveorite.)|`|yJdhhzypaa	Code Geass. Similar story. Guy wants to make the world better, and uses a unique power.|`|poOjs31caa	4ywbw4ybw4|`|70ihksK5aa	Hikaru no Go's artist is the same one who draw Death Note, you should try to read Hikaru no Go. it's not same type as death note, but it's pretty cool.    did you read death note 13? what about death note other note (novel)?|`|T7HLKcFLaa	Angel Sanctuary. If you're into the whole death concept. The artwork and characters are just as likeable.|`|JaZrG593aa	If you like that kind of thing, I would suggest Elfen Lied|`|wYF6U6qlaa	Hellsing
ODU3TO4Eaa	If it's a school play, whatever you would normally wear to school that day would be fine.    For a community theater group or other organization, you need to look nice but not overdone. Your top should be sort of dressy but still comfortable. Nice, trendy jeans would be fine, or black dress pants. Or you could wear a skirt and leggings if that's more your style. For shoes, wear clean sneakers or comfortable flats or boots. You don't want to trip onstage in your heels. =)    Good luck! Or should I say "break a leg"!  ?JoJo|`|BpJx0ebKaa	Wear clean, comfortable clothes in which you can move freely.  There may be vigorous physical activity involved in the audition, so be sure to wear something in which you'd feel OK leaping in the air, rolling on the floor, etc.|`|117971b0497cf2c18aa33a272d4e9ec1aa	IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO WEAR SOMETHING A BIT LIKE THE CHARACTER ( BUT NOT A FULL COSTUME!)  FOR INSTANCE - IF YOU WERE AUDITIONING FOR 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF"  or 'WEST SIDE STORY" 0r 'OLIVER" or 'MUSIC MAN" or "HELLO DOLLY" or 'PHANTOM" YOU SHOULD WEAR A SKIRT AND BOOTS  SO YOU COULD DANCE IN THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOMEN WORE IN ALL THOSE SHOWS -   NEVER WEAR JEANS OR PANTS TO ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF AUDITIONS   BUT  -- IF YOU WERE AUDIITIONING FOR  "RENT" - Yes! - wear jeans - trendy urban outfit that you feel comfortable in.  You want to give the "suggestion" of what your character wears.   Don't go out and spend a lot of money on a whole new outfit. It is not necessary. Sometimes you can find some great stuff in a 2nd hand store like "GOODWILL"  ALSO - COLOR IS VERY IMPORTANT - WEAR SOMETHING ON TOP THAT IS A PRETTY COLOR THAT REALLY FLATTERS YOU  - LIKE IF YOU HAVE BLUE EYES - A BRIGHT BLUE TOP WOULD LOOK GREAT OR IF YOU HAVE DARK HAIR - A RED TOP WILL MAKE YOU POP!  IF IT FEELS TIGHT OR ITCHY THOUGH - DON'T WEAR IT - YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING - WEAR SOMETHING THAT FEELS AND LOOKS GOOD SO YOU CAN JUST CONCETRATE ON YOUR PERFORMANCE!  good luck!|`|tzC4kXmoaa	NOT JEANS!!!!!   If there is dancing and movement in the play then wear comfortable pants.  If not you can be a bit more creative.  Wear khakis or other dressy type pants.  Always wear short sleeves, but bring a sweater.  You could get sweaty and nervous before the audition. Don't forget to accessories! And if you're going for a specific character try and dress a bit like the character.  Always look put together and original.  Take a look at stores like American Eagle, Charlotte Russe, and Wet Seal.  Good luck with your audition!!!|`|sRw9oiQdaa	It depends on the show.  For a musical you have to be able to move for the dance portion.  However, I would recommend dressing 'business casual' for the audition.  I have directed a lot and I think of the audition as a job interview.  I want to know that you are taking it seriously.  If you wear slouchy jeans and baggy hoody it tells me something about how seriously you are taking it.  That being said, if the play is about typical teens that might be a good look.  THink of the part you are interested in.  Don't dress in costume, but wear something appropriate in the modern age for that character.  For example, if you are auditioning for an uptight character, you might want to dress super preppy.  If you are auditioning for a 'sexy' character, you shouldn't dress like a tramp, but you could be a little bit provocative.

I can't remember his name, but after he eats several of Odysseus' men, Odysseus gets him drunk and puts out his eye with a sharpened stake. Then he's able to make his escape.  Side note: To add to Odysseus' cunning, he had told the cyclops his name was the Greek equivalent of 'nobody'. So when the cyclops called out for help, and the others asked him who was hurting him, he said 'nobody'. Clever, huh?  *This is an example of Odysseus being a good warrior because he a.doesn't lose his head in a seemingly hopeless situation, b. he plans ahead, c.he uses what materials are available to conquer his foe, and d. he is able to both control and care for his men.

You should first get a hunter, and get him into a pose similar to my painting below.  You'll also have to find a rabid dog, a beaver, a fish, a flock of gease, and a rabid squirrel.  It might take some work, but it'll look good in the long run.    http://img513.imageshack.us/my.php?image...|`|oRmyCqpEaa	yea, but that cat looks possessed|`|2TLXfQKDaa	They're not bad and could use some tweaks.  You're almost there!  Try not to take a picture of white objects on white surfaces, low contrast and bad lighting makes them blend together.  In some places it's tough to distinguish where the cats end and the lights begin.    You can take great shots with any camera, ignore the nay sayers.  And just because they're your pets doesn't mean others won't like to look at them.  There is a reason domesticated animal pictures are so desired.

B41roQ52aa	Hold your core like crazy. I'm sure you've heard that one before; I know I get tired of hearing it. But it really helps a lot. Also don't forget to spot. I know it seems like a basic thing, but a lot of people have trouble with it. With fuettes specifically, make sure that your leg is placed properly. Ideally, it should be at 90 (as in, parallel to the floor) at all times when it is not in passe. If you can't quite get it there (it's harder to get your leg up while turning) that's ok, but make sure your leg doesn't start out higher to the front and dip down as it moves to the side. It will mess up your balance. Also, make sure that your standing leg stays on the ground and you don't hop, because that will make you travel.|`|exf4OhPkaa	for pirouettes i would just do a bunch of releves(thats not spelled right) because that can give you the balance you need to get up there and stay up there also work on your spotting!! For fuettes you can get a bare or anything stable and just go through the motions of a fuette holding onto something, it really works it helped improve mine alot!!!  Hope this helps!!|`|927S4JN9aa	I do ballet. :)    When you do pirouettes and fuettes, really make sure your supporting leg is locked, and make sure you use a good amount of force when you turn. Also make sure you are really spotting, so you can get around faster.|`|dIJ2Q1t4aa	Well, for one, you need to make sure you spot. Make sure when you bring your leg up in your pirouettes that it is up at your knee, tight, and your turn out is good. Don't let your leg drop. As for fouettes, spot and try to stay balanced. Make sure your arms are following the movement in your legs. It took me awhile to get fouettes but with a little practice, I succeeded in them. Also, if you want to get the feel of fouettes, practice them at the barre.|`|0U53vlhEaa	Here is your outfit:   http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=62654... :D

BGU3VpQFaa	The Egyptologist by Arthur Phillips|`|GqrRBZ3faa	I bought a book once called Artemis Fowl. I'm not entirely sure what it is about, because I never read it, but I am pretty sure it is a mystery.
AA10980750	The site below has a time-line for the history of Ireland up to the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in 1998.
wZJbdAIKaa	This is a book about a very passionate romance of two people who are madly in love. Right or wrong. Would one call it a co dependent relationship? Likely. But then practically all relationships written about or celebrated are.  Anthony/Cleopatra is a story of a seventeen year old girl seducing a fifty year old man with the future of two kingdoms at stake.    In Pride and Prejudice, Darcy goes off and manages to "rescue" Lizzies younger sister by forcing her to marry a guy known to seduce and abduct underage girls, and he doesn't ask for her advice before hand. Not to mention something like Lollita by Nabokov....   I think that Meyers has skill, and she has an interesting vision.  And I think its realistic. I think that most people who do fall in love hard usually know when they have met the right person from the very start. You don't usually fall in love after years of realizing that a person has a great sense of humor, and will be there when your car doesn't start. It would be great if that was the case, and things like that do cement the love into a permanent state. But thats not how it occurs.    Obviously, the situation with imprinting isn't as sexual as you are making it out to be! Its no different then the way arranged marriage works in many cultures where two kids are meant to get married when they grow up. They are NOT being asked to consummate their marriage at an inappropriate age, just to consider doing it when their age is right. I guess "imprinting" is like arranged love. It is very clearly stated that there is no sexual element to this until both parties mature. maybe you just are reading what you want into the book and you want to be outraged.  I liked that Bella didn't constantly do that argue thing with Edward they always have in romances. Im not saying people need to always agree. But in many books they are constantly at each others throats over either easily dispelled misunderstandings, or some odd resentment because they wanted to be alone. I have a hard time respecting women who are so immature that they can't hold their tongues until they are sure there really is a problem, and so insecure that they are afraid that their identity is going to be "taken over" by loving another human being. At least Bella belly aches about something different.|`|fna0OfuCaa	I think its an adorable love story and I disagree with pretty much everything you said. Edward never really had a social life even before Bella, his only friends were his family, and they are still his friends after he is with Bella.. Bella's other friends no one really cared about, and the Jacob/Rennesme thing is really weird, but other than that I think all the books are excellent.|`|UtzALxfjaa	Meyer made a huge mistake. She made two people fall in love with eachother in one book. How does that work? It's not even true love, it's just "...Oh Edward you're so attractive, I love you, I want you, in bed. Your eyes are amazing, your ice-cold 'marble' chest is attractive. You're so fakingly nice..."  It's more interesting to see two people fall in love after a series of obstacles. But no. It took one book for them to fall for eachother. Not personality wise, but physically.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	yeah its tooo LOVE. its all about them and nothing else. it is good but edward isa  bit clingy to her . and bella sorta is strange for doing crazy stuff just cause they broke up.

dASDaT4Zaa	I'm not sure where to find the first chapter in her blog, but here's the link to it from the Private Novel website:  http://privatenovels.com/images/pdf/para...    The release date is February 24! I can't waaaaait. :D
BalZXz02aa	I'm sorry that your parents are not more supportive of your interest in music.  My advice would be to remind your parents that young people who are involved in music tend to perform better in school and to avoid getting into trouble outside of school.  In other words, if your parents help you get a flute, it may help you get academic or musical scholarships when you go to college; that alone would help the flute pay for itself.    I also play the flute, and have been for 17 years.  Music is something that will give you tremendous pleasure for the rest of your life; that's something else your parents should consider.  It can be kind of hard to explain to people who are not into music; I had exactly the same situation with my folks when I was a teenager.  Good luck to you!|`|gZgm243Jaa	I would ask rationally, and make sure to not let your emotions get in the way. My parents are pretty supportive, but I have had 3 flutes. Also--get your band director in on it. When you ask your parents, they may just think you want it to have it, not to use it. However, your band director could help the argument.     Good luck!
yndz0QbUaa	For description, just use a thesaurus and make sure you vary up your sentence structure.  Dialogue is way more important anyway.  For me it's the opposite; I can describe stuff forever but actual talking?  Not so much.    - Likes coffee with three sugars and no cream  - Can't resist a guitar player  - Reads magazines back to front  - Eats yogurt with a fork  - Is obsessed with crossword puzzles  - Likes classical music  - Hates ketchup with a deadly passion  - Reads comics religiously  - Goes to summer camp every year  - Sings in the shower  - Dreams about flying  - Washes hands more than usual  - Always wears mismatched socks|`|0QAUbLMnaa	hmm sounds like a challenge!    -watches spiders and tries to figure out equations for their webs  - eats mayonaise and peanutbutter sandwiches  - puts the christmas lights up in september because its still warm enough  - trims split ends one by one  - snaps fingers before starting into a run/jog  - makes up extravagant stories about the unknown collegues/peers/customers etc that delve deep into their personal histories  - is missing an eye because he stuck a wooden spoon into his jammed blender, it broke, and splinters shot into the eye.  - dreams of being an octopus fisher off the coast of new zealand, regardless of whether there are actually octopi there or not  - dances by turning both feet inward and bopping in little crooked pirouettes, off beat  - can't touch pennies because the copper color is similar to dirt, whereas silverish nickels and dimes look clean  - is a half-ginger, half-albino. Makes for some cool white-streaked red hair.   - Can't eat the "chicken nub" or last small bite of a chicken finger  - drinks vinegar to speed metabolism, and other crazy health stuff      hmm ok done for now haha
ugiUyhOwaa	I think you could patch them all together. You could have the 'love at first sight' theme. But, they don't admit what they fee; for each other until in the middle of the story. Then, for their love, they struggle to preserve and protect it together. Another important thing is that your charcters must have a chemistry.|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	I like love at first sight, and after a while they start dating, and auguring, but in the edn their relationshipp is great.|`|FPY8RbCdaa	Hrm, maybe describe their connection and love, put a few obstacles in perhaps an ex or a sickness/disease, and then make love prevail!!! haha    or    You could take a different route to comedy, there is the cliche hate each other-love each other...    or(haha last one)    You could make a very somber ending with death.. puhahahaha =]|`|lrZSzvxuaa	It all depends on your characters personality. YET NO LOVE AT FIRST SIGH! It is not original anymore. Let the characters explore their feelings and hormones so time is of the essence. If both characters are stubborn make them have frequent discusions. Not the type that is like:  -OMG and then they don't talk to each other and then they feel pathetic.  Have them have a little fight time to time. You canonly use the OMG fight if betrayl has happened.  Don't have a character agree on evrything the other says. That wuill make one look shallow and the other will be a push over. Not very good to see on how a person manipulates all of the saying of the other.  So let them take time, but have a sort of connection so it is obvious to evryone who is reading it but not to them.|`|1uxhfh6naa	It should have mystery, some humor, a little bit cheesy, and some meaning behind it. I love the ones where they're all "We can never be together"|`|yndz0QbUaa	-When there's conflict involved- some reason why the lovers can't/shouldn't be together.  (There's a reason Romeo and Juliet is considered the epitome of romance!)    -Ironically enough, death and destruction make books good.    -When the characters are total opposites but can't help falling in love anyway.    -When the characters aren't perfect and have flaws, physical or emotional, that make them realistic- unlike a certain sparkly vampire... *cough cough*|`|8W2Yx240aa	Being a romantic myself, I admit that the best romantic stories are between a man and a woman who shouldn't be together, where their lives wont work together, yet in the end, despite their greatest flaws and obstacles they find a way to make it work!    He's a killer that is sent to take her life, yet the moment he sets eyes on her he cant go through with it, and it isn't just because she is beautiful but something in his soul comes to life and he wants to fight the thirst to kill and love her.... throughout the story he is tempted to revert back to his old ways and in the end its between losing himself completely and loving her whole heartily....   Don't be afraid to end the story with a unhappy ending, some of the best romantic novels end in tragedy... maybe he kills her?!?!?! and he will forever live with the guilt that he killed his first and only love!!! maybe he is immortal and he will have to live with the guilt forever... (depends what kind of book your writing, obviously this isn't just a happy go lucky romance)
cCNj40fEaa	Yes! I do!!  one of the most popular fonts ever  watch this documentary film on the font    http://www.helveticafilm.com/    it's a piece of art, if you are interested in fonts and/or graphic design, you'll love the film|`|eBx6snKVaa	Yep, everywhere. That and Arial, Times New Roman, Comic Sans...It gets annoying after a while. People need pizazz in their websites! And stop overusing some.  lol :P|`|AA12339318	Why not?  It's a classic.    What someone calls "pizzaz" in a font is really calling for more decorative, therefore more difficult to read fonts.  Helvetica, and similar typefaces are popular because they do the job well.  They are easy to read "headline" type fonts.  They are designed, deliberately, to resemble the printed fonts we learned our alphabet on.  Remember those block letters we used to practice in kindergarten and first grade?  These plain, sans serifed fonts can be read quickly, at a glance.    "Pizzaz" has it's place, but not where the designer wants a clear, consise message.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Whatever's easiest to read, I like Ariel for that reason as well.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Actually, I'm not looking at it right now. This is arial. The lowercase "o" is more rounded, and the lowercase "t" has a slant at the top. Learn your typography. J/k. But yeah, it's become the default font of the day. Univers and Akzidenz Grotesk are also very similar to Helvetica and also way over-used.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	waht is helvetica, oh never mind!
DwLCTjTFaa	P&P's the best in my opinion, so it's best to save it for last, but since you're already reading it, I think you should save the other best, S&S for later and start now with Mansfield Park, Northhanger Abbey, or Persuasion, then work your way up to Emma and S&S, that way they'll be more interesting as you go.    btw, I'm the type that likes to watch well-made films of books after I read them to see how they've been brought to life and Jane Austen's books are one of the few that translate very well to film.  There are about a million versions of P&P, but I like the most recent one with Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet best.  And the guy that plays Darcy? YUM! lol|`|EJpVwMX2aa	Sense and Sensibility would be great!   Although all of her novelsare awesome so any one you choose will be great!|`|58WCrqe1aa	That really interesting one... oh no, wait! Doesn't exist.|`|BGU3VpQFaa	Emma or Mansfield Park  What type of herione would you prefer to read about next?  Emma (somewhat spoiled) has a little bit more spunk than Fanny (cinderella figure).|`|wWL934E8aa	Sense & Sensibility is good.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Sense and Sensibility as others have suggested, or Emma.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	They are all boring, so it doesn't really matter.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Emma|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I read "Persuasion," and it's pretty good. It's less well-known than the others.
DvToP5h7aa	Designed to demystify and make Shakespeare comprehensible.    http://www.mcgoodwin.net/pages/bookstoc....    ======================================...    What is Iambic Pentameter?    Iambic pentameter (eye-AM-bik pen-TAM-uh-tuhr)    The most common meter in English verse. It consists of a line ten syllables long that is accented on every second beat (see blank verse).     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pent...    http://www.answers.com/topic/iambic-pent...    http://www.tqnyc.org/NYC030240/iambic%20...    Fun with Iambic Pentameter    http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~mwh95001/iambic...|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	It helps to get a book like Shakespeare's A to Z that summarizes the plot of the plays.  That way, you can concentrate on the language and you already know what is going on in the play.  You could also glance over a book about Shakespearean language.  There are some phrases that are actually pretty dirty if you know what they mean (like "I prick thee!" which means what you think it means, a "nunnery" which means whorehouse, and any reference to horns, which means that the person's wife cheated on them and was VERY insulting).      Also, watching some of his plays on film (to get your feet wet, so to speak) is very helpful.  I recommend the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo and Juliet, the Mel Gibson Hamlet, and Titus Andronicus.     Reading it over and over also helps.  It may help you to start with an easier one, too.  My professor started us on Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream (both have film versions), then moved onto Macbeth and Henry IV.  She saved King Lear for last, and I would say that's one of the harder ones to read.    Try not to get hung up on some word or phrase that you don't understand.  Just skip over it for the time being and try to grasp the meaning from the context.  It took me forever to figure out what Hamlet's "to be or not to be" speech was discussing (contemplating suicide).      Think of the language like a puzzle.  It's actually fun to try and solve it and interpret the meaning.  A lot of times, there is no single meaning.  In the Renaissance, a written phrase that insulted royalty could get your head cut off, so a lot of the language is deliberately ambiguous.  Since we don't know what Shakespeare's intentions were, we can interpret it however we want in a lot of cases.    I do hope you can get through the language and enjoy Shakespeare!  It was a life changing experience for me when I finally picked up a Shakespearean play and it made sense to me.  You'll find that all of our modern literature (and most of our movie plots) stem from Shakespeare.  He was WAY ahead of his time, and seems to understand the human condition better than anyone else ever has.|`|wy8nzzJ5aa	first learn all about romance the read prose poems compose before u can say about shaks anything worth a dance.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	First off, I am glad to see your interest in Shakespeare! What a great choice!     Anyways, If you are a young adult (ages promptly about 17-21) and a sophisticated reader, it should be slightly easy. But, if you are not, may I suggest starting off with something a hint easier. Try Twilight,New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn, By: Stephanie Meyer. These book are a great start with length and with longer words. I yet, have not read Shakespeare either. So, I am starting off with lighter reading ranges to get started. I surely hopes this helps you!|`|B41roQ52aa	There are some of Shakespeare's plays that have two different versions in one book, with all of the right pages being the original and the left pages being a more contemporary translation. There are also versions where the story is told in Shakespearian on one side and the other side has a "dictionary" of some of the more confusing terms you might come across. I reccommend using one of these, because it's a lot easier to understand that way. I would also suggest that you start out with a play like Romeo and Juliet, with a plotline you already know a lot about. That way, you will be able to understand whats going on more easily, because you already know basically what's happening. Most schools also teach Shakespeare at least once a year, and having a teacher to explain things is a huge help. Once you get in the swing of things with the language, Shakespeare's plays are great. :)

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	The third one, the trees and the bench is my favorite.  Crop away some of the bottom and the sides, especially to remove the soccer goal (or whatever it is) on the right side..  I would think about straightening it just a bit so the trees appear vertical.  The one with purple branches made me look for a while.  The fourth one of the B&W trees would have been better to include the treetops rather than so much foreground.  Same thing with the pines in color-  The tree tops have been lopped off.  Overall I like them.  Keep learning and practicing.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Great use of light. Pretty sweet. Keep up the good work.|`|TR2EDuLWaa	You have real talent. I really liked the second pic the best.|`|GyrG1roTaa	keep it up youre doing goood|`|7AxLSwrPaa	It's not bad. The most unique shot you have is the one with the purple-colored branches, and the rest are sort of bland, creativity wise. But I know that's difficult with landscaping shots. And I also understand that you're working with limited resources. So all in all I'd say they're very well done. I like the first shot because it feels like you're seeing so much more than you really are. Good perspective. I've seen about a thousand other photos exactly like the third and fourth ones. And the last shot is nice because it has a touch of color, unlike the rest of the series.  Pretty nicely done. :)|`|2TLXfQKDaa	1) i like the overall composition, but would love to see some definition in the very subdued clouds  2) the edges seem too hard with that deeply saturated magenta  3) i would crop off 1" on the sides and about 2" on the bottom.  maybe not so much on the bottom, but the trees being a little closer to the edge of the picture would frame it naturally well.  the larger branches on the insides of the tree would naturally frame the top of the picture better too  4) seems empty to me  5) seems like it could really use a point of interest  6) a little less bare foreground a wee bit more space on the top    Very good pictures overall, if anything it seems like placement is the only thing that could use tweaking.  Cropping takes care of that so no worries.  You're on the road to success :D    Oh and I like the subtle greens in 6, keep it up!|`|XFidrxSOaa	niiiiiiiiiice!|`|aDGcmvaMaa	Pretty good.     Pictures 1,4,5,6 are sorta boring. Pretty, but it needs some thing to be in the middle. Something eye-caching.  Pictures 2 and 3 are very nice! I really like how the branch is sorta purple, but i don't know if that quite constitutes an a landscape. But beautiful.    VERY nice!!!|`|8xXPnKsQaa	I like your style of photography because you captured the exact point of taking a picture, and being able to savor the moment of the picture and all the scenery. In fact you do it so well, it doesnt seem like a picture at all, Its as if Im looking through with my own eyes, like I have fallen in the photo and Im there.    Excellent good Job XD|`|4yNhkOBzaa	I don't know anything about photography, but I'll offer thoughts anyway.    1) Sort of reminds me of a particular battlefield from the series Band of Brothers (WW2 drama). I feel like it would be good if there was a tall church, or some sort of interesting architecture that was 3x taller than all those little buildings.    2) I like it! The focus is nice, and I enjoy that shade of purple.    3) Seems well-composed, but lacks colour. I know it's just snow and dark objects, but it needs something more visually stimulating.    4) Needs a focal point in the foreground.    5) Would be better if it had colour, like  2.    6) Similar to  4, but a little better. It still lacks a focal point.|`|r1EfYjy7aa	it really really good  i like the fist one the most  :)|`|D4TJcSFRaa	you have a lot of talent! I really like how the branch looks purple|`|MerBQy4Taa	Your stuff is good but, if you wanna see some landscape/nature photography check out my gallery & it might give you some ideas. http://deakablackdragon.deviantart.com/|`|x51b4jsGaa	everyone girl thinks they are a photographer, sorry i don't like these.  its just snow on trees = /|`|qAyz1d0Daa	great job. i like all of them besides the second last one.
TR2MYeLUaa	The best way to remember chords is based around learning songs.  What I do is I learn a song on guitar, looking up all of the chords, and then I come back to it in a few days while learning other songs.  You'll notice that some chords are used more frequently in some songs.      The second method is to buy a chord book.  Just rote memorization but that's not fun.  You can also use it for reference.    Ultimately, chord theory is the best way to learn chords because knowing chord theory allows you to construct chords even when you aren't familar with the chord shapings.  Cyberfret.net has a lessons on chord theory that helped me.|`|2mWjyFXFaa	pick the most wanted song you want to learn and practice...  practice makes everything perfect.  before you know it...you are done with 1 piece|`|faeGZvZeaa	like how fast? you cannot expect to learn in a couple of weeks.

JOChNigNaa	Here's one of mine:    SENSUOUS SENSUAL OBSESSION  In wakeful sleep yielding.  The sounds of birds twittering,  Smells of spring's effulgence,  Warmth of summer's indulgence.  A honeyed finger traces  The golden velvet trail  Of hair to hidden places  Beneath and between warm fleshly folds  Whither salty sweetness dwells.  Boyish wonder, pulses' thunder,  Morning's milk and evening's sweat,  Gentle obsession in passion met,  Softness both and firmness there.  Taughtened muscles quiver,  Then relaxing shiver.  A rounded mouth now turns to kiss  And gently suck a bitten lip.  As a hand in added bliss,  Smoothly caresses his lover's hip    Yours is a very hot erotic piece, it's a pity YA doesn't have a category where we can share these without censorship.  Erotic poetry is one of the finest and highest points of the art.  It is represented in one whole book of the Bible called The Song of Songs.    [Here are a couple more of mine, they pass the censors:    CHOCOLATE LOVE  (88.88 Metre)  I feed my lover's sweet fancy  Fancy sweets, dreamy chocolate dark  Dark nights spent in each other's arms  Arms and legs wrapped in hot love sweet.    Sweet beyond the taste of chocolate  Chocolate kisses shared by others  Others sans our passionate love,  Love, this fine sweet fancy I feed.    (86.86. Metre):  I feed my lover's sweet fancy  Fancy sweet chocolate dark.  Dark nights spent in each other's arms,  Arms holding hot love sweet.    Sweet beyond the taste of chocolate.  Chocolate shared by others  Others sans our passionate love,  Love, the fancy I feed.]|`|avVdKiWKaa	Whew, I'm having an ASC* right now.

In the few paragraphs you've written, I understand your characters and what their mindsets are.

4cdbaeed61ac2ca800deac6d8b71a75daa	I would look at your favorite Movies or TV shows, and do a spoof of that.  You could, for example, take your favorite Disney movie, lets say The Little Mermaid, and write out a short version of the plot (a mermaid, falls in love with a human, gets help from an evil octopus to become a human who can't talk, falls in love with the human, the octopus lady tries to steal the man away from the mermaid, but the good guys win in the end).  Now you just have to be over dramatic, and make fun of the fact that it is not realistic.      I would also look up spoof on youtube.  Some people make really good ones.  The trick with making Movie Spoofs, is doing a movie that everyone knows, or else no one will get the humor.  Good Luck!

Us2YN8eoaa	Oh, I took a class on U.S. history, let me try:    1. The Roosevelt Corollary was basically an restatement or assertion of the Monroe Doctrine. Therefore, the answer is B.    2. This is probably dollar diplomacy, as the other policies are from other presidents. Pick C.    3. This one is most likely A, since Wilson carried on U.S. intervention in Latin America.    4. This was the American Civil Liberties Union, as the Scopes trial was was about the interpretation of religion, in this case, the view of evolution. The answer is A.    There's a chance I could have made a mistake, but I'm fairly confident these answers are correct.

onkUcy19aa	The Pope (from Latin: "papa" or "father" from Greek ??, ppas, "papa", Papa in Italian) is the Bishop of Rome, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church[1] and head of state of Vatican City. The current (265th) pope is Pope Benedict XVI, who was elected April 19, 2005 in papal conclave.    The office of the pope is called the Papacy; his ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the "Holy See" (Sancta Sedes in Latin) or "Apostolic See" (the latter on the basis that both St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred at Rome). In addition to his spiritual role, the pope is Head of State of the independent sovereign state of the Vatican City, a city-state entirely enclaved by the city of Rome.    Early popes helped spread Christianity and resolve doctrinal disputes. At first, the pope's secular ally was the Roman Emperor. In the 8th century, however, Pope Stephen II was forced to appeal to the Franks for help, beginning a period of close interaction with the rulers of the West. For centuries, the forged Donation of Constantine also provided the basis for the papacy's claim of political supremacy over the entire former Western Roman Empire. In medieval times, popes played powerful roles in Western Europe, often struggling with monarchs for power over wide-ranging affairs of church and state, crowning emperors (Charlemagne was the first emperor crowned by a pope) and regulating disputes among secular rulers.    Gradually forced to give up secular power, popes have come to focus again almost exclusively on spiritual matters. Over the centuries, popes' claims of spiritual authority have been ever more clearly expressed since the first centuries, culminating in the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for those rare occasions the pope speaks ex cathedra (literally "from the chair (of Peter)") when issuing a solemn definition of faith or morals. The last such occasion was in the year 1950 with the definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary.    The Longest-reigning Popes:    Pope Pius IX.is possibly the longest-reigning pope.  Although the average reign of the pope from the middle ages was a decade, a number of those whose reign lengths can be determined from contemporary historical data are the following:  1. Pius IX (18461878): 31 years, 7 months and 23 days (11,560 days).   2. John Paul II (19782005): 26 years, 5 months and 18 days (9,665 days).   3. Leo XIII (18781903): 25 years, 5 months and 1 day (9,281 days).   4. Pius VI (17751799): 24 years, 6 months and 15 days (8,962 days).   5. Adrian I (772795): 23 years, 10 months and 25 days (8,729 days).   6. Pius VII (18001823): 23 years, 5 months and 7 days (8,560 days).   7. Alexander III (11591181): 21 years, 11 months and 24 days (8,029 days).   8. St. Sylvester I (314335): 21 years, 11 months and 1 day (8,005 days).   9. St. Leo I (440461): 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days. (7,713 days).   10. Urban VIII (16231644): 20 years, 11 months and 24 days (7,664 days).     Saint Peter is thought to have reigned for over thirty years (AD 29 - 64?/67?), but the exact length is not reliably known.    The Shortest-reigning Popes     Pope Urban VII is the shortest-reigning pope.  Conversely, there have been a number of popes whose reign lasted less than a month. In the following list the number of calendar days includes partial days. Thus, for example, if a pope's reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.  1. Urban VII (September 15September 27 , 1590): reigned for 13 calendar days, died before consecration.[33]   2. Boniface VI (April, 896): reigned for 16 calendar days   3. Celestine IV (October 25November 10, 1241): reigned for 17 calendar days, died before consecration.   4. Theodore II (December, 897): reigned for 20 calendar days   5. Sisinnius (January 15February 4, 708): reigned for 21 calendar days   6. Marcellus II (April 9May 1, 1555): reigned for 22 calendar days   7. Damasus II (July 17August 9, 1048): reigned for 24 calendar days   8. Pius III (September 22October 18, 1503): reigned for 27 calendar days   9. Leo XI (April 1April 27, 1605): reigned for 27 calendar days   10. Benedict V (May 22June 23, 964): reigned for 33 calendar days.     Note: Stephen (March 23March 26, 752), died of apoplexy three days after his election, and before his consecration as a bishop. He is not recognized as a valid Pope, but was added to the lists of popes in the fifteenth century as Stephen II, causing difficulties in enumerating later Popes named Stephen. He was removed in 1961 from the Vatican's list..|`|DenLZAL1aa	According to the Roman Catholic Church St. Peter was the first Pope and his reign started around the year 30 AD. The exact date of his death is not know, but it is estimated St. Peter served 35 years as the Pope.    Pius IX served 31 years, 7 months and 23 days from 1846 to 1878 as Pope capturing the longest confirmed reign as Pope.    On the other end of the scale is Urban VII who was Pope from September 15 to September 27 1590 lasting a mere 13 days.
JvmYeqH6aa	Hi hunsbunstonsoffun,    All that Gold  .  .  . is not glitter  .  .  .    Almost ALL men usually refer to strippers as:    Whores  .  . Sluts  .  .  . Skanks  .  .  .etc, etc  .  . though never to the poor girls face. They will all laugh about her and condemn her - out of earshot.    It caters to a crowd - non appreciative of Dance, rhythm or form - and is frequented by - well  .  . . just a lower class of intelligence.      Ask your (sic) boyfriend - if he has ever - in the past - referred to a "Stripper" as a slut??? Honestly  .  .  . they almost ALL do.    That's not what you want for yourself  - is it?

Most strippers appear to be drug addled losers, with no other options. And it could possibly jeopardize your future employment if they find out.

If you don't mind old, hot, sweaty mean watching you, go for it. They said that they dont talk to anyone outside their work or take it outside.

TshtUehjaa	I think it depends on the person    I play clarinet, and find it fairly easy, but I'm not very good with rhythms ... I have to work at them sometimes to get it right, but some of my percussionist friends can look at a rhythm and play it with no trouble, but have trouble reading notes for the bells or marimba.|`|xbjJfoeqaa	drums are way easier.  the clarinet you have to have your lips just right and blow perfectly.  and drums you basically gotta bang so you are both right according to your question|`|otYOxmnuaa	drums require you to have total control of all your appendages - arms and legs.  If you're to be an excellent drummer you need to train and be able to operate each one independently.      They also require you to have impeccable timing -- as you're the beat behind the melody.  Speed up or slow down and you drag the tune into unknown and/or unwanted territory.      However -- it can be done.    I played trumpet, baritone and french horn 5th - 11th grades.  I play drums now and find that it's difficult to venture outside of your natural tempo.  Check out drummerworld.com for some fantastic drummers.      It's all about feel -- if you're not feeling the clarinet, try something else.  If that something else doesn't fit -- there are hundred's of others to choose from.      You have to feel comfortable with it -- and be able to learn how to play it efficiently.     Can you hold a beat behind your brother's set?  If so, there's probably hope.  Remember, with any musician and instrument, you're only as good as the amount of practice you put in.  Quality practice too - -not just goofing around...unless that's your intention.  ;0    Have fun with it whatever you choose.

All you have to buy are drum sticks if you play at a school band!!! (No reeds!)|`|07bX5jGsaa	I don't know anything about clarinet.. But I can tell you that it does look hard. But drums are deceiving. They look easy, but you got up to a drum set, and you can't plat anything that musically makes sense. Believe me, I've been playing drums for a while, and when I started I made no sense.    Anyway, to play the drums you need to be able to have total Independence with all your limbs, which takes time to learn. Playing the drums you have to keep time, because if you don't, your going to drag the whole band to be slower, or make them faster, which can create total chaos. There are many many many more aspects that make drums hard. Here's some examples of different drummers that have good control playing different types of music.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0TJ50FS...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-BRee2bA...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKx5cY4Oc...

I approve.    *The volturi come*    Volturi: Rawr.  Bella: *Anger*  Volturi: Seeya.    The end.|`|ZYPyX0ieaa	Breaking Dawn is split into three separate "books", or parts. The first part details Bella's marriage and honeymoon with Edward, which they spend on a private island off the coast of Brazil. Edward grants Bella's wish and makes love to her. Soon after, Bella notices her period is late and realizes that she is pregnant. After contacting Carlisle, who confirms her belief, she and Edward plan to return home. Edward, concerned for her well being as the fetus develops with unnatural rapidity, urges her to get an abortion. However, Bella wants to keep the child and decides to contact Rosalie for support, knowing that Rosalie has always wanted children.    The second part of the novel is written from Jacob Black's point of view, and lasts throughout Bella's pregnancy and childbirth. The pack of werewolves, not knowing what danger the unborn child may pose, make plans to destroy it, even though they must kill Bella to do so. Jacob vehemently disagrees with this decision and revolts, leaving the pack to form his own with Seth and Leah Clearwater. Bella soon gives birth, approximately a month after becoming pregnant. The baby breaks many of her bones, and Bella loses massive amounts of blood. In order to save her life, Edward changes her into a vampire. Jacob, who was present for the birth, immediately "imprints"  an involuntary response in which a werewolf finds his soul mate  on Edward and Bella's newborn daughter, Renesmee.    The third section of Breaking Dawn shifts back to Bella's perspective, finding her changed into a vampire and enjoying her new life and abilities. However, the vampire Irina misidentifies Renesmee as an "immortal child", a child who has been turned into a vampire. The creation and protection of "immortal children" was previously outlawed by the Volturi. After Irina presents her allegation to the Volturi, they plan to destroy Renesmee and the Cullens. In an attempt to save her, the Cullens gather vampires from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake. However, they remain undecided on whether Renesmee should be viewed as a threat to the secret existence of vampires. At that time, Alice and Jasper, who had left prior to the confrontation, return with Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like Renesmee. He demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat and the Volturi leave, knowing that they no longer have just reason to destroy Renesmee. Bella, Edward and Renesmee return to their home, free to live their lives in peace.      i just copy-pasted it from wikipedia.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	This has been asked just look it up.

From the WarCraft Archive, it segues easily into Beyond the Dark Portal and Tides of Darkness. After reading all of those, I'm now starting in on the WarCraft - War of the Ancients Archive.

Us2YN8eoaa	This might not be very much, but you'll get the basic idea:    Hamlet's aim is to kill Claudius, his father's murderer.    Laertes's aim is to kill Hamlet, who killed Polonius. Polonius is Laertes's father. Therefore, both Hamlet and Laertes want revenge for their father's death.    Fortinbras is a military leader who achieves his goals though violent means, and is Hamlet's inspiration. Hamlet, Laertes and Fortinbras all want to carry out their goals through violent means, specifically by killing other people.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.    About Hamlet     Whats Up with Hamlet?    Many scholars consider Hamlet to be one of the most complex dramatic characters ever created. You might also think of him as kind of a jerk. And maybe insane.  More    Character summary:  http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...    ======================================...    About Laertes:    Laertes, a young Danish lord, is an obvious foil for Hamlet. He faces the same problem that Hamlet does  a murdered father  yet he reacts in a completely different way. Hamlet broods over his fathers death and does nothing; Laertes storms home from France as soon as he hears the news, not even waiting for an explanation. First, he raises a crowd of followers, invades the palace, and takes the King hostage (sort of). Then he starts asking questions.  More    Character summary:  http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...    ======================================...    About Fortinbras:    Fortinbras, like Laertes, is a foil for Hamlet, only on a larger geopolitical scale. Fortinbrass father, the King of Norway and also named Fortinbras, fought a duel with Hamlets father, also named Hamlet. Hamlet Sr. killed Fortinbras Sr. and also seized some of his land. With Fortinbras Sr. dead, his brother took over the throne. So Prince Fortinbras has a dead father and his uncle on the throne, just like Hamlet. But while Hamlet sits around contemplating death, Fortinbras tries to fight a war against Denmark to win back his fathers land. When that doesnt work, he decides to fight a war against Poland to reclaim some lost land. Hamlet, conspicuously, does not do this.

The pictures on it are in poor quality... they seem to be snapshots and the focus is bad on some of them.  For a band to take your request serious, they would want to see a site that promotes them.  Your site looks like, "I just got a point and shoot and took pictures of people at a bar"    Take pictures that are well composed and lighting done right.  Try taking some photo shoots of local bands for free, photoshop whatever looks bad in it, and show them the results.  If they really like the pictures, give them a copy and have them sign a release so yu can use it on your site.  Oh yeah... the site.  I think you should remodel it so it doesn't look like a blog.  Add a gallery, a blog and a interview area etc..  it needs to look professional.  Some Myspace pages look better than it.    Don't be offended... it's just in bad shape right now for business.|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	use correct grammer and spelling. most people wouldnt even condsider you because your site is unproffesional|`|jIccV2sOaa	Just give up.

PeZYLt4vaa	It just depends on what the coach,teacher,or individual girl would like to wear. For example in dance we wear the matte (they look more natural), so for twirling since I already have the tights that is what I wear. It just depends, but the matte look more real, more professional,and are less distracting.|`|YTasscmKaa	I don't know, but those shimmery tights got it all over the matte ones.|`|UBUoqsL4aa	In dance we were them sometimes.  depending on the style or rest of question.

Albus was so set on the thought that Slytherins  were bad, but his childlike manners were just  so refreshing. He reminded me of Harry - he  was misled to believe all Slytherins were bad.

xYAuW0Wqaa	If you find someone interesting to shoot, just try asking them if you take their photo for a project or something. You might want to bring some photo release forms just to be technically legal. Explain to the person what your project is about and why you chose them for you subject and see if they will let you photograph them. If you have a business type card with some of your contact info and contact numbers, they can contact you later if they change their minds. for your protection, you should have some assistants (friends) helping you at  your home studio.  If the people you ask turn you down, don't let it bother you. Just keep plugging away until you get enough models to fill you portfolio.   I hope that helps you.

Dead Until Dark is a vampire-mystery novel written by author Charlaine Harris. It was originally published in 2001 in paperback. It is the first book of the The Southern Vampire Mysteries, and focuses primarily on a young telepathic waitress from Bon Temps, Louisiana named Sookie Stackhouse, who begins a romantic entanglement with her vampire neighbor amongst a series of murders of young women in town.[3]    Dead Until Dark has been adapted as the 12-episode first season of True Blood, a show based on the Southern Vampire Mysteries.

Especially if it's at night, with no sunlight coming through the windows.    I don't know whether you're using a film camera or a digital camera.  But with typical household lighting, using an ISO rating of 200, you would need a timed exposure of several seconds.  To give you an example, I've taken pictures inside, just using normal incandescent lighting, and with 200 ISO film and the aperture set at F/8, I would do a 6 second exposure.    Even if you open the aperture to f/3.5, you will still have to do a timed exposure, of at least 2 or 3 seconds would be my guess.    You will HAVE to put your camera on a tripod and use the "B" (Bulb) setting if your camera has one.  Then try an exposure of 5-10 seconds, with the aperture at f/8.  Even with the shutter speed at 1/50, that is NOT nearly enough of an exposure.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	how much light is there from the beginning?  What ISO are you using?

KGj1dxhQaa	i'll help with what i know:)  sound- music is important since it's all about dancing. ren has fast, new, dance music. the kids of bomont have slower songs, on the verge of country. and in church, it's slow and...uh...church-ish.  character- check wikipedia for character personalities. there are many character's with specific traits and such.  language- ren has really cool sayings (probably found in the quotes section of the footloose imdb page). willard, for instance, is usually played with a southern ish accent as are some of the other bomont kids.  communication- ariel and her father don't see eye to eye and don't agree much. she grew up and he can't accept that. willard has a hard time talking to rusty, who likes him and he likes back. he also can't dance and ren teaches him if that counts. ren's  uncle, aunt, and cousins don't understand him. they're country and he's city. they're chuch going and he's clucb going. kinda liek ariel and her dad.  costume- ren has bright colors and "hip" if you will, clothes. it's set in the 80's, so that comes into play. the bomont kids are generally in country type clothes- cowboy boots and hats, peasant skirts, jeans, checkered button up shirts, overalls. it depends on the character. areil wears more adventurous clothes with her boyfriend and at the end. everyone wears normal clothes at the dance.  set/stage design- school, bettys burger blast, church, railway, dance hall, town hall meeting place....    hope that helped. check youtube too. http://www.youtube.com/user/ncstweens  they have practically the whole show on there. good luck and i hope i helped!|`|kadF3gCqaa	The best way to evaluate any theatrical work is to ask yourself whether it allowed you to have a willing suspension of disbelief. Then, what was the project trying to do? Was it successful in doing so? How well was it done? Each of these questions needs to be applied to each craft you sighted in your list.      The important element - did you believe?|`|GLS7vgAdaa	I'm sorry to say this but I don't know that you can write an evaluation of this kind without having seen the production. Here are your options as i see it.      1. Find out from the theatre or media department if the show was video taped. (They usually are, so there's hope.) Watching that should help with some of the criteria needing to be covered such as looking at the characterization, language, communication, and the set/stage design.  you might not get the most ideal picture of the voice work and the sound but do what you can with the video provided. the rest you can kind of make up if you BS well. basically make sure you can see everyone you're supposed to, and the make up and costumes are right for the 1980's small town setting.     2. If there is no video to watch, definitely talk to your teacher (preferably with a doctor's note in hand). you might be able to go to a production in your community or something. the bottom line is that you show him/her that you're doing everything possible to get this assignment done.     Best of luck!|`|wAz7Ub0Raa	It sounds to me like you are also doing AS Drama like myself, in which case if you speak to your teacher you should be allowed to go see a different production and write about that one instead.  We went to see two performances to evaluate, and some people only went to one of them.    It will be impossible to talk about without going to see it - the whole thing is about your reaction to the performance.
IvrZyjrPaa	Dear Poet,    This is a good poem as far as the words and story line are concerned, It does however need some tidying up so that each line in each verse are about the same length    I wonder does she like me, I am sure I do not know,  All of the looks she gives me has me thinking so.  Her eyes are just so beautiful, her voice so sweet,  She is the type of girl that men would love to meet.    How do I talk to her, Should I say can we meet,  Ask her for her number, tell her she is sweet.  All we do is look and smile, and barely ever speak.  There is something about this girl; something unique.    Every time she looks at me; chills run down my spine,  In class I cannot focus, no wonder I am falling behind.  Who cares about Polynomials  or the square root of three,  I want her to really see me, to have her go out with me.    Should I ask her if she likes me, I question in my heart,  We seem at times so close, then all things fall apart.  My mind is in a land of daydreams, oh what am I to do.  I can but hope my dreamings will one day all come true.      This is just an alternate way of saying how you feel, but please feel free to reject it. It has tidied up the poem.     Robert H

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" is an 1865 short story by Mark Twain. It was also published as "The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" and "Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog." In it, the narrator retells a story he heard from a bartender, Simon Wheeler, at the Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, about the gambler Jim Smiley. Twain describes him: "If he even seen a straddle bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get toto wherever he going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorio...    http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=l...    http://www.usopera.com/operas/jumpingfro...    http://marktwainmuseum.org/    http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/in...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The story was also published as "The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" and "Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog." All three are typical "tall tale" titles, suggesting nothing more than a myth about some amazing frog. The three titles fail to hint at the political undertones in the story, which can be found in the name of the feisty dog Andrew Jackson and the amazing frog named Danl Webster, who was cheated from winning by a wily stranger who fills him with quail shot so that he cant move.

Set during World War II in Germany, Markus Zusaks groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she cant resistbooks. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.

Wanda thinks she is no help to the human so she want to go to a different planet and when she asked Doc to take her out of Melanie he does it but he puts her in another body, witch wasn't part of the deal.

The Host by Stephenie Meyer is good. Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is also good.    and..Twilight is good, but I know people who aren't a loud to read it because of the vampires and all. but that's stupid. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to read it. It's beautiful, and at times i cry when i read it. i've read all 4 books 5 times. since christmas. and i'm still going to keep reading them.

The flat metal fits in between the pages just like a paper mark, and the decorative metal head sticks out over the top of the book.

Below is a list of my favorite books, and maybe you'll find something that you like too.     The Three Musketeers - Alexandre Dumas  ~D'Artagnan heads to Paris to join the King's Musketeers. Since he can't join quite yet, he joins the Guards and befriends three musketeers known as the "Inseparables" because they are such good friends and never seen without each other. (Athos, Porthos, and Aramis) D'Artagnan is living in a time with plenty of court intrigues, and the Cardinal acts as ruler by controlling the King. With his friends, d'Artagnan works to foil the Cardinal's plans and save the Queen, all while balancing his hectic romances.     The Phantom of the Opera - Gaston Leroux  ~ Christine Daae is only a mediocre singer, but one night surprises the whole opera house with a dazzling performance. Her childhood sweetheart, Raoul, falls in love with her, only to discover that he has a "heavenly" rival. Christine claims that the Angel of Music is visiting her, and that he teaches her to sing. Meanwhile, the new opera managers are having a tough time with the opera ghost, whose demands leave their pockets dry.     Mythology - Edith Hamiltion  ~ Edith Hamiltion has a collection of some of my favorite myths which includes; Aphrodite and Adonis, Cupid and Psyche, Pomona and Vertumnus, The Fall of Troy, the abduction of Europa, and more.     I don't have any time to write out a summary for the rest, but these are other great books that are in my favorite list.   The Scarlet Letter - Nathaniel Hawthorne  Sense and Sensibility - Jane Austen  To Kill A Mockingbird - Harper Lee  The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood - Howard Pyle      Happy reading!|`|Xe94coYQaa	There is a really good book. I think it is called Twilight.|`|X2zwBlgJaa	read the Cirque du Freak series!!!!    they are the best!!! its a vampire story  a kid goes to a freak show with his best friend. and the freak show is well, FREAKY! Darren (the main character) comes to the place where the show was and steals one of the acts, the spider. little did darren know is that his best friend would be bitten by the spider and come near death. Darren must chose between saving his friend, or becoming half vampire and assisting mr. crepsly. the original owner of the spider is a vampire, and is the only one known to Darren who has the anti-dote to this deadly venom. Darren choses to save his friend, and becomes a half vampire. this is his story of his like as a half vampire.    ive had all the books since yesterday, (1/31/09) and am already on book 4 (2/1/09) i  THIS STORY IS NOT LIKE TWILIGHT IN MOST WAYS.    *edit* this series has twelve books in it.  the first is Cirque Du Freak, ask for that, and any library or book store will know what your talking about|`|Mpnrcs6Laa	The Sookie Stackhouse series that the show True Blood is based on, if you like fantasy and such but want it a heck of a lot dirtier than Twilight, then this is perfect.|`|whMygrGBaa	Angels and Demons. its coming out in movie soon so after you read you can compare between the book and the movie|`|MuCNK2vxaa	Eragon by Christopher Paolini  Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment by James Patterson  Through Wolf's Eyes by Jane Lindskold  The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan

But being curious, as all humans are, they'd try to learn as much as they could about what they were seeing.|`|05anyV31aa	They would probably recognize artillery if you dropped into the 1400s. They'd be afraid of aircraft. You see guns in the 1400s, were slow and were called bombards or simple cannons.

Until they breakdown, or the bullets ran out.  They didn't have the technology to make those kind of weapons back then.    Tank would work till they ran out of gas after that they  would be useless. They didn't have refined gas back then. Not to mention bad roads.     As far as Aircraft they would be useless from the start most of the USA modern Army rely on Satellites. Which they won't have back then.     I would say yeah they would probably enjoy some initial successes. After that it would be all down hill.|`|3tnistZQaa	That's not a simple thing to answer. It all depends on which culture and which exact time period you're talking about.    Modern military technology and warfare methods rely extensively on things like electricity, radar, satellites, fuel and other supplies. Guns can only last as long as there is proper ammunition available. On top of that, modern armor is not designed to withstand old world weapons like arrows and spears. Also, our modern soldiers aren't as tough as the warriors of old because naturally our way of life has gotten substantially easier, even during war time.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	They would unconditionally surrender.    Once they saw air support, they would give up.    They might shoot a few arrows here and there, but they would quickly be blitzed. After the tsunami a few years ago, a relief helicopter had spears and arrows thrown at it in the air by Andaman Island tribal people who had never seen this before. No damage done, and it was not an attack helicopter, but imagine if it had been.
DvToP5h7aa	The Call of the Wild - Jack London - (1876 - 1916)    In the beginning of the novel, Buck is introduced as a delicate, sophisticated yet innocent dog. He is used to being treated with dignity and respect and has been raised to be trustful of men and their wisdom. When he is uprooted from his home, he is startled to learn the inhumane side of mankind. He experiences brutal beatings in order to be 'broken' into submission. He is shocked to see a good-natured dog, torn to pieces by a pack of huskies, and the incident considered as a sporting event by the men who witness the scene. Within this harsh environment, Buck learns the laws of survival.    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/C...
2TLXfQKDaa	Go for uniqueness.  An unusual angle, an action pose, or something really moody.     Biggest tip, if you can do NOT hold the camera in your hand and take the picture.  This technique is good sometimes, but as a profile pic it's overdone and typically terrible.  Set your camera on something, and use the self timer.    Something to be mindful of.  Snow on a sunny day is going to make the photo look pretty bad.  Try and shoot on an overcast day, the diffused light will help a ton (shoot in the morning or late afternoon - you can't go wrong with using the golden hours either).  A pile of leaves on the snow would be great for contrasting colors.      A bench in a park, with a shallow depth of field would look nice.      Step out of your personal norm and you'll probably get some photos.|`|QUR4uBnZaa	The best pose is by sucking the roof of your mouth with your tongue, it gives you a natural pouty pose but not too much of a pose.    Hope that helps :)|`|0fhn4FSpaa	Make it black and white   and then give like a gooofy face  then take out half of ur face out of the picture   and it should look cute  if you want an example  then go look at myspace profiles  they have cute poses

Do your own work :P|`|ye6IiFr7aa	ok this is mine I wrote but u can take a few things from it:     An amazngly gorgeous girl (thats unfort. a geek. she has either blond or brown hair with big blue eyes. she is amazing even popular guys like her.) She is with her popular bf named Josh (or w.e u want) and they r on a walk. they are at the beach, but she (the girl) cant swim. Josh and his best friend Jake are in a fight over the girl. He wants to go out with her but Josh is. Jake has anger managment issues. they are having a picnic at the beach. Josh goes and gets something from his car and when he comes back the girl is gone. She is at the top of the cliff (at the beach) with Jake. She is at the edge and jake is holding her hands behind her back. well here is my SHORT example please add detail.               Casey and I sat at the beach. The cold sand that was under us made me shiver. We took a bite of our delishious food. We were having a picnic. I felt like I was the luckiest guy in the world to have Casey as my girlfriend. Me, Josh Karlson have the prettiest girl in the world as my girlfriend. Life is good...so I thought. "God its starting to get cold out." Casey suddenly said as she looked out into the ocean. Her blue eyes matched the color of the water. "Do you want me to get your jacket?" I happily offered. "Oh thanks Josh!" She gave me a tiny kiss as I hopped up and ran to the car. I missed her already. I got to the car and pulled out her jacket. When I closed the door and started to head back I noticed she wasnt there. "Casey?" I screamed. No asnswer. "CASEY JOHNSON ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW" I demanded as I yelled in worry. "Let go of me! Now!" I heard Caseys low and soft voice say. "Casey?" I said low. She screamed.

AA11172918	It's not something you should quit your full-time job to do. There are hundreds of digital scrapbook kit designers who are peddling their wares to a marketplace that is very limited since so few people actually have the software to make a digital scrapbook page and know how to use it.     I would say that most make less than $200 a month in sales. A very popular designer might make $3000 a month or more in sales. But keep in mind that that's  gross sales and doesn't take into account business expenses. There are store fees and commissions, PayPal fees, server fees if the designer has her own store online, fees to for software and computer supplies.     The more popular digital scrapbook kit designers also design for paper scrapbook companies.

ALsUI6fRaa	Yes, there's a difference between "knowing" and "memorizing". It seems like you need to do both.

AA11703549	How about Bram Stoker--the author of Dracula? I'd love to see his response to it. He'd probably shoot himself. The whole point of Dracula was that sexual desires are evil and women are the weak ones that give into them.    The question for your book report is very vague and poorly worded, though. Tell your teacher that internet people thought his/her question was poorly worded.|`|km1vuLUzaa	what do u mean who needs to read the story?    nobody needs to read anything  you just read it cos u want to|`|g7gH4geLaa	A person who needs to read this book is someone who believes they can't fall in love.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Hmmmmm.....hard to say. Twilight wouldn't be such a nice choice. I love the series, but the length will just make your report harder.|`|6MpoAh6Aaa	Hi!!  I agree that the author of Dracula should read the book. The opinions on vampires, although they are mythical creatures, are so different and opposed that it would be quite interesting to see the response.   I also think that a character from Wuthering Heights should read it. Throughout a couple of the books, Bella compares herself to people in Wuthering Heights.

Someone that needs hope that all will be well in the end and he/she will get the love of his/her life.  Make sure it is a character you are familiar with.    And please, don't use a historical figure.  Romance is pure fantasy escapist fare and they would throw the book on your face unless they actually feel like reading this sort of teen angst.|`|YA36FUf1aa	Change the book your report is about perhaps?

Pride and Prejudice: This novel of 1813, written by Jane Austen is the most read novel worldwide. The novel tells about the initial misunderstanding between Elizabeth and Darcy and later their mutual engagement and love for each other.

XLRx5decaa	Summer. I'm pretty sure it's in the summer, because they talk about how it's a day before lammas tide, which was some holiday or something back in Shakespeare's time, which took place during summer. Plus, on the day where Mercutio and Tybalt are killed, they were all aggravated by the heat.    Edit: It took place at the end of July.    PROOF  "Nurse: ...She is not fourteen. How long is it now  To Lammas-tide?  Lady Capulet: A fortnight and odd days."  Lammas Tide is August 1.|`|S2ByqJSmaa	I believe it is July, specifically, but most definitely the summer.|`|wZJbdAIKaa	In the summertime, but no month is given.|`|tmMLFDwqaa	In Act 1 Scene 3, it is said that Juliet's birthday is in a "fortnight and odd days."  This means a little over two weeks.  It also says that her birthday is on Lammastide eve.  Lammastide is a holiday celebrated on August first.    So,  if her birthday is on August first, and it is a little over 2 weeks to her birthday, it must be sometime in July.

Just don't judge them by the cheesy cover- they're not as pulp as they look.  But it's a good fantasy series, heavy on the adventure.  They go down reeeeeally easy, as the writers are all quite good story tellers.  Drag?  Forget it.  Definitely something not everyone is reading, too...    What else... There's always Shogun, that's a clasic.  Well, depending on who you ask...  Anything done by Neil Gammon is worth the money.  Terry Brooks has a really quirky, enjoyable style and writes pretty offbeat stories, to say the least...    If you dig Sci-Fi I'd recommend Andre Norton.  She's good, and one of the first female sci-fi writers published.    Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are surprisingly engrossing.    If you want more or different genres, you can go ahead and e-mail or message me.  I've been a pretty heavy reader since.. er.. well, I could read.
gUhve1dHaa	If it was taken at a low resolution then it is extremely doubtful that you would be able to get it to a good enough quality to print large and onto canvas.  You should ALWAYS take pictures at the highest resolution that your camera will allow.    1|`|C77c0OE2aa	What size do you have your camera set to? Always keep it at the largest size and highest quality settings. Far too many people will not have their camera set to the best quality and largest resolution settings, then when they want a particular photo that is important made larger, they can't do it.    As great as Photoshop is, enlarging smaller photos is about the WORSE thing it does. There are other programs, such as Genuine Fractals or Photo Zoom Pro which are dedicated to enlarging digital photos and do a MUCH better job than Photoshop. If you want to try sending it to me and tell me exactly the size you want, I will run it through an up res program and see what results are obtained.    steve|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Let me fix it for you...  i got some spare time...    contact me at:    loves2bearhug_N_MN@yahoo.com|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	I would guess she meant that the number of pixels used when you took the picture are too low.  This can't really be helped that much by Photoshop I'm afraid.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	What resolution is your camera?  If it's pretty low a smaller canvas would still be fine, but mural size will yield some pretty bad results.    After a picture has been taken, you really can't add more pixels to the image.  More pixels will allow you to blow up the picture with better results, but eh as already said, if the picture has been taken and is low res, then you're out of luck.|`|7Vj0vaSyaa	there are little tricks you can do but it still wont be fantastic.    open a new blank photoshop page that will be larger than your photo, then copy you photo into it and enlarge it by dragging the corners. Then double click and the photo will enlarge and photoshop will try its hardest to give it as good a quality as it can. Then use tools such as grain reducer and unsharp mask and even the auto colour correction. i done it this way once and worked out quite lucky. Still wasn't brilliant but had a nice retro look which fitted the picture anyway.|`|FOTanZ3Faa	You can't improve on a photo that much if the photo iteslf is not of a decent quality. It's a shame that lots of great photos are low quality, but you can still print it smaller.     You could otherwise try using an artistic filter from photoshop, like perhaps making it into a watercolour, or a chalk and charcoal sketch.|`|4e55bf2d7b472d9d927ddf7c3220c25caa	Ok like.    Try this.    Open image in PS yeah.  Go to image, image size.  Look at resolution.    From what you say, it will possibly be 72. Change it to 300. Click ok, then it should be as big as a house.   It may not be great quality yeah, but like it will be large enough for printing.      Maybe try noise reduction afterwards.

pZGLhV2Waa	From your description it sounds like you need two lenses. Three hundred dollars is not going to cut it. The 28-105mm would be a good all around lens but you will loose out on the wide angle and it is not all that long. It also is not a macro lens. Macro lenses allow you to focus very closely and get a life size image. For example you can shoot an insect and fill the frame. These lenses are anywhere from $250-$500 and are prime lenses. There is no zoom.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Zoom is nice, and depending on what your taking macros of inanimate or animated things you'll need to be mindful of the speed that it can focus.  Catching a pic of a dragonfly, or those bee-like flies is a daunting task and your lower end lenses though capable aren't as good as the more expensive lenses.      The expensive lenses are expensive for a reason, fast motors and lower aperture numbers.  Because you're going to be using faster shutter speeds, you're going to want big honking Fnumbers.  5.6 will get it done, and 3.5-4.5 certainly will too.  Lower is better.  See if you can find any reviews about the focusing of the lens.  Fast costs more slow costs less, yours seems like it's somewhere near the slow (based upon price and aperture), but not too shabby.  Do a whole lot of reading between the lenses, asking here is a great start, but really hit up some lens forums and read the reviews at various sites like adorama.com and bhphotovideo.com    Testimonials really help a ton.  If you can see if a store will let you try it out before you buy it.  Most of your better stores don't have a problem with this.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	The 28-105 will be a decent all around lens and will give you an actual range of about  42mm-160mm once you put it one the camera due to the cropping...certainly not super telephoto !!!    Also, this type of lens is not going to give you the true MACRO shots....say of a bee sitting on a flower where you can see the bee's eye's and antennae in clear focus. For that type of shot, you need a specialty MACRO lens.
2TLXfQKDaa	Most of your shabby all the way up to the super expensive ones will work on your camera.  Turn your camera upside down, see that tapped screw hole?  Tripods use a pretty universal thumb-screw-on-plate method.  You disconnect/slide the plate from the tripod, align it with the hole on the camera and just screw in.   I've used countless tripods and haven't had a problem yet with any tripod.      I use a cheap Modo tripod for most of my photography.  On turbulent days where I don't need to do a whole lot of hiking, my heavier tripod works wonders.  It's bulk keeps it fixed with no interference from the weather.  You can get a pretty good tripod for 50 bucks no problem.     When I'm biking/hiking I use my moderately light weight Manfrotto Modo.  It cost about 54 dollars.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	The screw on the bottom of your camera is a universal size meant to fit all tripods. So you can mount your camera to any tripod. That said you do have to look out for the maximum weight the tripod can hold. If you put a large SLR with an even larger telephoto lens on a cheap tripod it is liable to fall over.   Just about any tripod over $50 or $60 should do the trick though. I suggest you take your camera to the store and try them out. Find one that seems sturdy and you should be all right.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	you should be able to find tons of tripods in that price range. the tripod typically comes with a little detachable universal adapter that you just screw onto the bottom of your camera and then just snap the camera into place on the tripod.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Any tripod under $100 will work... you just need to decide on what your going to be shooting to determine the size you want.

vDPCNimoaa	Interesting question. I do not think human nature is evil, I think what influences the person and how they were born makes them evil or not. Those "selfish" people choose not to help others but there are many others in this world who would definately help. There are probably some part of us in our core that makes us a bit selfish, greedy, cruel, but thats only because humans were made that way, its the way we were created. It helps us survive, and it helps all other animals in this world survive also. Imagine a world without any selfish/greedy/cruel people. People would give away everything they have to the more unfortunate, and the unfortunate wouldn't want it because they would feel guilty. Also, nobody would feel right to harm any animals so we could have food. We wouldn't live very long would we?|`|YmtNel5haa	I don't think so, have you read The argument from Nature by Thomas Hobbes.  I think that if it comes down to a question of survival as in Lord Of The Flies than it could turn ugly, however that was a book about CHILDREN, and children and adults do not rationalize the same.|`|QmpobMj7aa	Yea pretty much...we may say, and truly believe, that we would sacrifice ourselves for others... but when we are faced with such a situation our survival instinct takes over and we do what is natural of all beings; fight or flight. And more often than not, if we get the chance we choose flight.|`|KDCXd3B0aa	Yeah, it seems like it. But this makes me depressed, so I wont write heaps on it.|`|qUueClvXaa	Human want more and more. They want to accomplish more have more and make more.;  but....I don't think it could be said to be evil.;|`|UY6c7DG8aa	How do you define evil? everything is relevant.  And our souls is greedy selfish cruel.  I, a couple of days ago, asked this question" will you kill a person, if he/she threatens lives of your loved ones, and killing is the only way to stop him/her, will you do it. The majority said yes while 2 out of 13 said no.  what does this mean? it means we are greedy, selfish and cruel.  we'd rather let someone else die than having our own loved ones die. but if u don't kill this person, u are evil for not saving ur loved ones. but if you do, you are evil too, for ending someone else's life for your loved one, this person might be wrong for threatening ur loved ones' lives, but he/she must have a reason, simply saying it's this person's fault won't cut it.  for even loved ones, we rather let others die. what do you think about ourselves? Surely in most cases we love ourselves more than others. For sure we'd kill.  I see what you're talking about on war times. The golden rule of kill or be killed. All of us rather kill than be killed. The act is justice, if your ethnics are based on your own survival. But if your ethnics is about being generous, selfless and gentle, then it is evil. So in the end, based on my ethnical believes, i would say this is not evil. We're built with this for our own good that is the survival. Back when we were cavemen, if we were generous, selfless, and gentle, we wouldn't have survived at all. When we were designed( me no religion just saying), we were of selfishness, is it evil though? Rather than using evil to describe these features of our souls, i think the word"nessesary" is appropriate.|`|fGlGg5EUaa	if human nature has no evil....this must be the god!! but...why he/she come to the human world ???|`|7Msk7HhKaa	Yes, the human nature is indeed evil.|`|b1sB4fuGaa	1984..thats such a good book.   & good question|`|ZW0La7M7aa	Yes it is, and a sci-fi book and wars prove it.    Books are the product of an artists imagination and wars are an extreme circumstance.     Though honestly, who are you to think that you'd get serious intelligent answers on a place like Yahoo Answers?|`|I6D7xdcVaa	Human nature is nonexistent. And society is the only thing which has allowed greed, arrogance, and hatred to continue existing. Drop society now though and people would go crazy, but when we all first start out we are pure.|`|AA10286634	I have seen two year old babies biting each other.|`|jN0njYgjaa	Yes, they are indeed evil, thats why this world is coming to an end soon.|`|nkjZ2moJaa	first you have to ask whether evil is conventional or not.    is evil (as you said: greedy, selfish, cruel, etc) absolute or a human convention?  if evil is just defined by people, then we could set the parameters for qualifying for evil (or good) wherever we want, and the question is meaningless.    but if there is an objective condition called evil, then by determining what that absolute standard is, we can begin to determine whether humans are in fact good or evil.    but i know of no person whos experienced the horrors and atrocities of humans first hand considers people basically good.  that is, most of the people you see who talk about the goodness of humanity, or even as a blank slate, havent generally endured the hardships that much of the worlds population has at the hands of fellow humans.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	We are  both evil and good, angels and demons at the same time.  That is why choice become central.  We have to choose the way we will go, live, do and speak.|`|3xifCMwQaa	fdjakea;jldksja  if you havent already, read lord of the flies!|`|zP1BCpsGaa	Speaking technically, there is no human nature. Humans evolved on this earth simply to reproduce. However, your question has alot of sense. I will answer it, but not agree with my answer, I guess. Well, nobody ever says, "Well, it's human nature" to anything good. If someone has sex with your girlfriend/boyfriend, but that was because that person gave your partner a puppy.... well, that doesnt make sense. But you get where I'm coming from, right? BUT DONT LOSE FAITH IN PEOPLE, MAH FRIEND. Think of all the good things humanity has done. If not humanity, people. if not people, one person. Think. :D Dangit, that was DEEP!  To congratulate myself...  I THINK IT CALLS FOR ICE CREAM!  mmm mmm GOOD. wait no thats campbells.|`|ONMBbC16aa	We are greedy, creatures of a nature we can not escape, of which is that we were born with a hole in our heart, that we can never have enough. So, as the most educated of the creatures on Earth, it is our duty to help all and expect nothing in return. Damn it, I sound like nun, well I'm not, but I am still right.|`|7NPF8ivUaa	Human nature like everything has to have a balance,therefore,good and bad sides to everything,evil is just another way to express negativity.goodness,is positivity.So the secret is how to manage,both good and evil.so yes there is good and evil in us all.these traits in our nature rise to the surface due to circumstances and situations.love and light  Zoe|`|xyMkhfWYaa	no, but we're not inherently good either, we are shaped by our surroundings    but at the core we do things based on instinct, all notions of "morality" are man-made and meaningless|`|AA11442722	That is the split between liberal and conservitive. Liberals think deep down people must be controlled to behave. The greater the level of control the better behaved people will be. Thus they trade liberty for security.     Conservitives believe the opposite. Deep down people are good and if left to their own devices will do the right thing more often than not and those who fail to do the right thing will suffer the consequences of the community which is a far more effective deterrent than any other means.     I favor the conservitive view myself. What man, even the most evil amongst us does not think himself a good man? No matter how twisted their reasoning they usually think deep down they are doing the right thing. No matter how bizzarre their morals they feel that they are in the right. A person sees the good inside them first. A sociopathic killer might sacrafice their life to save a child. A politician might risk severe consequences to help a family in need. The exception being psychotics. They view the world with no empathy for other humans. While only a small percentage turn into serial killers, they are all killers none the less.     Even the worst of the worst however if given good context in which to express themselves can be healthy and productive members of society. 1920s Mobsters went out of their way to not shoot innocents. They provided necessary services to society and were some of the most charitable people around as an example. On the flip side extortion schemes could find them some of the cruelist around.     My main point is that people when given circumstances and societal reinforcement to do the right thing will do exactly that more often than not. Even politicians back in the day when society cared about honesty would not abuse their trust too much in most cases. Today they almost openly sell the interests of their people and their trust on the open market. The lack of societal reinforcement being the primary cause. The lack of a good outlet for the kind of person they are the other.|`|LQUHzXTcaa	Have you read Frankenstein by Mary Shelley?    The demon was born innocent, but society rejected him and he became evil. Nature vs. Nurture.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)    In 2002 the National Construction Safety Team Act mandated NIST to conduct an investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center, as well as the 47-story 7 World Trade Center. The investigation covered three aspects, including a technical building and fire safety investigation to study the factors contributing to the probable cause of the collapses of the WTC Towers (WTC 1 and 2) and WTC 7. NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes, standards, and practices, and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices, standards and codes. NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners, contractors, architects, engineers, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters. The investigation portion of the response plan is scheduled to be completed in 2008 with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center. The final report on the WTC Towers  including 30 recommendations for improving building and occupant safety  was released on October 26, 2005    http://www.nist.gov/index.html  http://nvl.nist.gov/nvl2.cfm?doc_id=65|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Here's some interesting background to the NIST reports:  http://hk.video.yahoo.com/video/video.ht...
oqnvY8Mxaa	Here are some things you might want to try:    Chords  Scales  Circle of 5ths  Reading Music  Transposing    Because you play be ear, you probably do a lot of transposing. That is when you see (or hear) something in one key, but you play it in another. A way to work on everything I listed would be to find a book called "A Dozen A Day". It is pretty much a book with different exercises, all written in the key of C. As you begin to learn different chords and keys, you can transpose these.|`|YYfUzxNzaa	Chords, definitley.

Ow3O7h4caa	The Floyd rose usually has a locking mechanism at the nut which is why it is good for divebombing and what not.    That is the price you pay for quality. Your Wilkinson needs good quality springs like Fender or Floyd Rose. Then you will see the difference. The springs are too weak and take a while to return to their original tension.    Also, what type of pickups are you using ???????|`|FViagGVEaa	Thats weird, though i cant really answer that, i dont really like whammy bars, but all guitars i have with one are floyd's with locking nuts|`|aw2xkdSbaa	In order for a note to sustain, regardless of bridge or tremolo, there needs to be an uninterrupted string vibration. Your wilkinson may not be as well built as the floyd rose. The floyd rose is pretty much the best made tremolo bridge and locking nut. this permits the string to continue resonating even when divebombing and bending. The wilkinson most likely does not hold a string cleanly and interrupts the resonation (regardless of pickups or amp).|`|sUtUR2IDaa	because without the floyd rose when you dive bomb it can cause your guitar to go out of tune very fast trust me stick with floyd rose the can stay in tune for 3 weeks and you can dive bomb all you want and it want go out of tune

kQSkA2c6aa	Of course the US contributed a huge amount in WWII any one who argues otherwise is an idiot... but to answer your question on why Brits (and Russians) get the hump, here's just a few personal thoughts.    1) Far too many Americans (fueled by Hollywood) act as if they won the war single handed..... they didn't, far from it.    2) The US never declared war on Germany, the US was quite happy to lend the UK the money to buy US weapons for two years (which the UK spent the next 20 paying back... nice morals guys, that's like making your police buy their own bullets), but never actually went so far as declaring war on the most evil regime of that (and most other) time.    3) The US did not save our a** any more than we saved the US.... without a base of operations in Europe and the destruction by the British (and Norwegians) of the German atomic bomb and long range missile projects... New York and Washington could well have been within range of German Nuclear missiles by about 1944.... don't forget almost all of the US missile program post war was developed by Germans......you're welcome, don't mention it... oh that's right...you don't.    4) The US/USSR were not our only choices.... Germany did not want war with Britain, we could signed a peace treaty in 1940 which guaranteed British colonial rule in SE Asia... with this treaty the Japanese would not have invaded Malay or Burma and therefore would have had thousands more troops and aircraft to throw against US forces in the Pacific (bye bye Hawaii). It was a matter of what was right and wrong...(call it subborness if you will) not money and self and interest that kept Britain fighting.     I do not in any way impugne the individual contribution of American servicemen in WWII... we should ALL thank them every day for hat they did, but no more than Russian, Australian, Canadian, South African, British, Chinese, Indian and many other forces.    Stalin put it well    The British gave us the time to win  The Americans gave us the money to win  The Russians gave the blood to win    I don't think you'll find it's the WWII contribution that Brits are stubborn about .... it's the post war arrogance and ignorance.|`|QusqTXCaaa	I agree that the US did a hell of alot during WW2, but so did Britain.  We couldn't have put down the Axis without you, but you wouldn't have done it without us either.    You might find us less hostile if you remember how much fighting was done by other nations than the US during WW2, because the British aren't alone in thinking that the Americans are either under the huge delusion that they defeated the Axis single handedly, or could have.    The Germans had no original plans to invade Britain, and the one they scraped together, Op Sea Lion, would never have succeeded.    http://gateway.alternatehistory.com/essa...

Yes with our help the war was ended. However, we couldn't of done this with out the British or the Russians. Where the hell do think those plane took off from? The Brits made easier to prepare for the war ahead. They also new we weren't ready in 1942. They were the one talking us in to invasion of the Western Africa. Just to give us a taste of what the war was like. Yes we played a role. We had a country that would be able to produce the weapons to stop the war. Fact is the British lost just as many Soldiers in the war as we did. They're not proud, they just understand that we couldn't do with out them and they couldn't do without us. Eisenhower understood this better than anyone. He got rid of anyone who was against working with the British.|`|XaLuh6aeaa	I doubt any brit is ignorant of the part America played in the war; the lend lease agreement alone is a monumental thing.    Much of the defenciveness comes from America media (which pretty much is the major world's media) writing Britain's achievements out of the war. The capture of the enigma code machine and the escape from Colditz Castle are both themes that hollywood has turned into movies. In both cases the americans are the heroes despite the Americans having nothing to do with either event in history.  There was also a movie about the battle of the Bulge which ignored the fact that large numbers of British and Commonwealth troops were in the same area and only showed Americans.    Also, Britain was fighting for almost three years before the Americans sent combat forces in. There were American pilots fighting for the British before that, but they were volunteers and not the American military.|`|IKCxj9gHaa	the problem is the saving britains **** bit, you have to understand that is what we have heard for the last 60 years, listening to some americans you would think Britians role in the war was to be an american car park. the problem is the way the war was portryed in hollywood as John Wayne coming to save the day, without any mention of the fact that Britian lost far more war dead than you, fought far more battles than you and did it with far less than you.     the truth is we lost everything in that war, our empire, our homes and our riches, we lost not only our men but also our women and children in huge numbers also. we went into it a superpower and came out a broke and barren nation.     credit works both ways, everyone here knows the great role America played in winning the war, and we know the massive cost in lifes it took you, (our cemetaries still have your boys in them) but the people here really hate the fact that none of this is mentioned and it is the immpression we get is that the UK just hid under it's bed until GI joe came to save us!?! don't take it personally, this is a long running issue between our peoples,     you are a bit different to your average american on this issue because you have clearly spent time finding out the full picture of the war, but the same can not be said for many of your peers
sFjYVH7paa	They are pathways used by the men and women accused of being witches in Salem, Massachusetts to escape from the people who were hunting them.  I think you meant to use the plural form  '...Salem witch trail(s)?    I don't know of too much research concerning these paths.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Then you go to your search engine, and you search "Salem Witch Trials".      That is how you do research.  Not by asking others to do it for you, or to feed you the results of THEIR years of study!    And, to answer the title question, they were trials, in Salem, where the people were tried for being witches.|`|gn3SIhKDaa	I love the story of the trials. I've even gone to the actual hanging site. o.k. the town doesn't want to be know for the trials because they are ashamed. some of the people hung weren't actually witches. But people go there just because of that anyway. have you read the story because its really hard to understand if you haven't. so go pick up the book first. Even though this is a very widely known story its very controversial. oh in your research make sure you include that there was a man that wouldn't talked so they pressed him with rocks till he died.
PmFjedcNaa	There are a lot of reputable agents and editors out there, but you need to learn to present your manuscript and ideas properly.  Start at the beginning by checking out publishers' websites and finding out what you need to do to make your book worth reading, and then find an agent that can market your work.  MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GET A REPUTABLE AGENT AND A REPUTABLE PUBLISHER.  You don't want to be ripped off.  Good luck!
FaX8awk1aa	it was more like the articles of conferation in that most of the rights belonged to the individual states rather than the central government.  this caused many problems in fighting the war and early on may have cost the south a victory

I have learned from the best.. NYIP Dean Chuck DeLaney.      I dont understand why I have 2 thumbs down. ..Im going to school for this.. and my teachers are the top photography judges.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	First there is the technical side. Basics are is it in focus? Is it exposed properly? Is the colour balance correct? How difficult is to take the picture (a bird in flight is more difficult than a flower)? Is depth of field controlled? etc. etc.. These are easy to evaluate and mark.    Then there is the much more ethereal world of aesthetics. People have tried to define aesthetics with limited results.    We all know about the rule of thirds (which is an approximation of the Fibonacci ratio or the Golden Mean), trines (three's in a shot gives balance), anticipation of movement (leaving a space for moving subject to move into), lead in lines (natural lines that lead the viewer into the picture), hooks (details that the viewer discovers, it keeps the viewer looking at the picture), angles - viewpoint (a camera can easily be made to take up unusual viewpoints such as a worms eye view), a frame within a frame (the most clichd is the overhanging tree branch and trunk of the tree, an archway, a doorway anything that is part of the scene that makes a natural frame)  and, most important of all a subject. I could go on here as there are hundreds.    This last one is usually the one that is lacking in most shots I see as a judge of photographic contests, with a few notable exceptions all sunsets come in this catagory. People are usually good subject especially children, but they should be doing something, the best shots are where they are not aware of the camera and you capture a little of their world. This is difficult if they are your own relatives, a true photographer should be detached. Technically I would be looking for the eyes to be in focus.    On viewpoint, when photographing pets or children get yourself down to their level (into their world) too many shots are taken from above (dominant) which says to me that little thought has gone into the shot, the same can be said of too many landscapes, snappers just stand there and shoot, low or high angles will usually work better as its a view we are not used to seeing and gets our attention because of that.    On landscapes try to have something in the foreground, something in the middle ground and something in the background background, if one of these is a hook so much the better, this adds depth.    Fill the frame with the subject, then go closer still, as I was taught years ago 'if you can see their ears your too far away', this is a classic 'banker' shot. Obviously if you are photographing someone at work you need to show what they are working on and their surroundings, but there should always be at least one in your sequence.    This is really only scratching the surface, books have been written on this.

Some judges scrutinize sharpness, drawn to the super-crisp pictures.  It helps to have a well executed photograph.    And presentation is key.  Mat your picture properly or it will be dismissed.  If you don't care enough to present it correctly, you don't care enough about the picture.  I've had that happen to me (painful lesson that one).    Sometimes it's an unexpected picture that strikes a judge's fancy.  Sometimes you've nailed their tastes.  My suggestion is to take every competition as a learning experience.  If you enter the competitions at your local photo club, the judges usually talk out loud about their impressions of the pictures.  That's way more informative than you can get from a book or online.|`|YwdFUCQtaa	Relevance (to the contest rules), visual and emotional impact, technical quality, compositional excellence.

Check her out she is really good.|`|qEh84eqNaa	Eh, Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert might fit what you're looking for. It's about a woman who is married to a man she doesn't love, and is somewhat disgusted by. She wants a grandeur life full with expensive things and passionate love, and spends the majority of the novel trying to fill that void in her life with sex, money, and material items (the sex scenes aren't graphic, but you can tell that's what is happening). She picks up two lovers and throws her family into debt from her spending.    Another one is Tess Of D'Ubervilles by Thomas Hardy. Like Madame Bovary, the sex scenes aren't explicit, but are written in a way that you know the characters are having sex. Tess is a novel about a young girl (Tess) who is sent to live with her aunt and cousin. Her cousin rapes her. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby boy, who dies a few weeks afterward. Because of her "sin", she's treated as an outcast, and hence moves to a different town, where she begins work on a farm.  There she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Unaware of Tess' past "sexual history", Angel marries Tess. When he finds out she had an illegitimate child as a result of rape, he leaves her and says she is no longer the woman he fell in love with. And it all just sort of falls apart from there.

CXh6Seigaa	The plot seems a little cliche, but I'd just keep working with it. It's tons better than some of the shojo crap out there.    Don't begin with something that states the end. It will confuse the watcher/reader. I'd also suggest nixing the vampires. Too overrated.    Why not come up with your own mythical type of being? The funnest part of anime/manga writing, in my opinion, is unique character design. Without good characters, your manga will flop. Characters are even more important than plot in that media. And I don't just mean looks. A well-put-together character with flaws, depth, and things the reader can relate to is a key point to a good anime/manga.    Make your characters have traits that readers will identify with and give them problems that people  understand. Even though Twilight was so popular, it was a total fluke. No other story with such unrealistic characters could possibly make it in the world of literature and television.|`|hoPk1RRmaa	sounds homo|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	i like it, but vampires are kind of cliche :(|`|PyW5xHU0aa	DONT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE SAY YES.  they just want the points for yahoo.

I will persist until I succeed.  4. I am natures greatest miracle.  5. I will live this day as if it is my last.  6. Today, I will be the master of my emotions.  7. I will laugh at the world.  8. Today, I will multiply my value a hundredfold.  9. I will act now.  10. I will pray, but my cry for help is only a cry for guidance. (For wisdom, good health, abundance, peace of mind, happiness, prosperity and success, discipline, detachment, discernment, dharma, faith, hope, charity, mercy, and LOVE!).
30bf34f40be263047a0e7830d4a2989caa	Stonewall Jackson.|`|AA10725882	You might be referring to Lieutenant-General A. P. Hill of the Confederacy killed near Petersburg, Virginia the first week of April in 1865.  The fatal wound shot off the thumb of his left hand before entering his heart.  His body was later moved ~100 miles to his home county.  http://www.mdgorman.com/Written_Accounts...    The answer below "Stonewall Jackson" could be right also, but it was the entire left arm that was buried separately in Jackson's case.  I'm sure there were other generals in the Civil War - or other wars - who lost a left hand and may have had it buried separately.

wOc4Dqllaa	1. They can't just admit the past, they have to look like they have full control over everything, including who's fighting who. In a society like that, people have been brainwashed since the day they were born, so convincing them of the details of a war is a very small matter.    2. Yeah, I'm quite sure that there is no war, or a real Big Brother. All lies to control the people    3. Miserable, broken people are easier to control than moderately poor, angry people, and less costly than fat and happy people.    4. Sure, the Outer Party's lives seem worthless, but there've gotta be people at the center of the Inner Party, who controls everything, wealthier than imaginable.|`|YIplumj8aa	Of course it would be easier to admit the past; but that would go completely against what this book - and Red country - is all about.  Red wants to always be right - even if it means having to re-write every last book and magazine.  They want people to believe that Red is never wrong; they want people to never question what Red says or does.  I do believe that the other countries are real, otherwise why would the war change from one to the other?  If they weren't real, there'd be no point in having to re-write history - they could just keep the war with the same country all the time.  So yes, those other countries are real and that's why everything must be re-written to show Red is always in the right.  And the citizens are living in poverty BECAUSE they are living in a communist state.  Communists believe that no matter what, everyone deserves the same pay, items, etc.  So if everyone has to get an equal share, that means everyone is essentially poor.  There is no rich, no middle-class.  The governement gets the majority of the pie and the citizens have to divide what's left amongst everyone.  And is there a point to all this?  Of course, when Red started out, I'm sure it was an awesome place.  Communism in theory is great, but rarely works out.  So Red thought they had a perfect plan however, they never realized how big it would get - how much re-writing there'd have to be, etc.  Now they are stuck and have to continue it, otherwise, what would they do?  They can't just say they give up, that's not an option.  They are communists after all and will never admit to their plan not working out.    Plus, controlling that many people can't be that bad - in their eyes - I'm sure!  Hope I was able to help!

pkKnV46saa	I;m taking World History right now and we started Mesopotamia in the Beginning of the year.  That is because Mesopotamia was the cradle of civilization, the place where all civilization began.  This can even be researched in the bible.  From Mesopotamia came many great civilizations.|`|AA10729675	huge.  They created the city called Babylon.  It was at the other end of the Fertile Crescent (the other end was Egypt, other great civilization).   Like the Egyptians they were conquered by the Persians.  But unlike the Egyptians, they were not optimistic.  They were very pessimistic.  Their region was between (Meso) two rivers (potamia.   medicine).  They had ways to communicate with the East and with the West.    so, good commerce.  But most of all, Mesopotamians codified the law, many times.    A very advanced system of laws.  We know the most famous, the code of Hammurabi.  But this code just was the extension and embellishment of the preceding codes.  A reproduction of a part of the Hammurabi code is in Washington DC, in one of the greatest building there (the Capitol?)    Life in Mesopotamia was very much like a modern life, with diversity, commerce, work, religion, laws, cities with big streets.|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	it is the first recorded civilized civilization in the history of the earth... that's pretty important haha|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Mesopotamia is important to various religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) because they all hold historic importance regarding famous cities and stories that took place there thousands of years ago.    Mesopotamia (meaning "land between two rivers") was home to the world's first complex civilization (to the best of our knowledge), Sumer. Sumer's oldest city is known as Ur.    It is believed (and logically makes sense, if Sumer was indeed the first civilization) that people radiated outwards from Mesopotamia to inhabit what is now Europe, Africa, Asia, and later, the Americas.
AA10147709	I dunno if this helps everyone, but it really helps me, I always listen to KoRn, to somebody else it would be a very weird and disturbing band and when I let go and listen to the music I just feel like an insane asylum patient..(which is great, I'm an aspiring actress for the haunted house I plan to open in a few years)    If that doesnt work, or if their music is just not something you want to listen to, try loosening up, burning incense, smoking a cigarette, whatever you do to "get in the zone" listen to fast paced music, whatever and freak out..Like, have you ever seen crumping? It's in the first few minutes of that movie "stomp the yard"|`|Mig6O93Naa	Ask your director that is what they are for.

AA11441385	Financiers concentrated on protecting themselves from the risk in loans instead of looking at the inherent repayability of the loan.  If the risk was passed on they could write dodgy business without caring if the loan was repaid or not.  Derivatives protected them.  Successive levels of the financial system passed the risk on.  Unfortunately, ultimately the quality of the loan does matter.  Something that we all discovered last year when borrowers defaulted and the derivatives became worthless.|`|AA11442722	Outsourcing, illegals, H1 type visas and monopolies.  They produced a service heavy based economy built upon low paying jobs, with no job security.  This has caused a steady downward spin.  This service based economy is a form of economic canibalism and is doomed to collapse. Until we bring jobs back to America it will  continue to worsen exponentially as each person laid off will lead to 2 or 3 others laid off six months later.     Lots of people blame regulations or lack of regulations and lots of other vodoo. That's all it is voodoo. Bleed any economy enough it will die and we have slit the US economy's throat with all the money we are sending out.

kUE3Ddktaa	It's called "Death with Interruptions" by Jose Saramago. He never names the country where people stop dying. The first half is about all of the social, political, and economic troubles that come with immortality. The second half is about death (the character), who falls in love with a man who was supposed to die.    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/books/...|`|0j4qZQgcaa	no it france and its called im not sure but i think its catashphe  i cant remember srry helpd as good as i can maybe it will remind you
m0hvyQicaa	To me it doesn't seem to flow, the best suggestion I have is to say it out loud to yourself and if something doesn't sound right, if sounds like it has to many syllables or too little, then revise it.  I think you put a lot of feeling into this so try to make the words flow without changing the meaning and I'm sure it can be beautiful.
dL0A7hMhaa	A solid effort- it's an interesting topic and you made a good choice in rhyming it. Just watch out in lines 3 and 4 of the first stanza- they don't rhyme and you might want to do so for the sake of continuity.    I think the line "I look over-head, above is a ceiling" is a bit awkward and needs reworking. Maybe "I look above at the ceiling" or something like that.    There are some punctuation errors also.|`|giyLM0VOaa	to tell the truth.  if u use the hymn of 'how to save a life'  it sounds like that
DHdK3vVoaa	I think the only thing you should change is the last line of the first stanza: "you will be blind".  The line prior is 9 syllables, and it just sounds better to me if both lines have 9 syllables.
E9cRutZ9aa	ok..so get a thesouros and find strong words for your poem. then try not to FORCE the ryme. ryming is cute for a kid, but when you're in middle/high school you DO NOT need the ryme. it makes you look very ammiture. so your poem is nice, but try and reduce the ryming! Other than that i give you a 8 1/2 out of 10!!

Slaughterhouse-Five - Kurt Vonnegut  To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee  A Clockwork Orange - Anthony Burgess    They're kind of weird selections, but I think these are the sort of books that even people who aren't books should read. A Clockwork Orange is probably the weirdest, but I recommend it because it is a story about growing up, without all the schmaltz and the whining.

Tell them exactly what you know and what you looking to learn from them. Maybe even get on with pay.  Volunteer at first, most will tell you that they can't do that without paying you...  then say how you'll do it for minimum wage.  At that point you'll get your foot in the door to learning a career.

pDKm9Wmgaa	You applied the paint too thickly. I don't know how you would fix that.   When painting t-shirts, I use Folk Art acrylic paint. I also mix in textile medium with the paint to make it more pliable. It doesn't change the color of the paint.   I would suggest doing another shirt and chalk this one up to experience. Also, when you get the shirt painted, wash it inside out and hang it to dry. Putting a hand painted shirt, (or even a commercially painted shirt) in the dryer will cause the paint to crack and peel.
ijSjRY1Taa	Hey, I'm 14 years old and have been dancing since I was two. I love ballet! It really is a sport. It is so much fun!  There are so many things about it that are great! And the learning experience is phenomenal.   GOOD THINGS  1. Stretching/ Flexibility        *you will be more flexible! It's a cool thing to say, "I can do the splits!"  2. Strength        * You will gain strength everywhere. Core (Abs) legs, even arms.  3. Friends       * You will meet people there and "connect" with someone  4. Happy       * If you like this class, you'll be happy and have a high point in the week!    LEARNING  1. structure.  2. organization  3. love  4. passion  5. expression      Hope I Helped!   ?Dancer8Gal?|`|MYhh29Qfaa	I'm 13 and i just started this year. It is so much fun. you make new friends too.    Pros:                          Cons:  new friends                  You have to stretch and practice a lot  exercise                      balance is hard for a while  discipline                     remembering what you learn at first  structure                      NO DRAMA!  posture  elegance  you have fun    In the beginning of class you do bar work and stretch. You do this for the first couple months and then you start the recital dance. You get nervous but you get confident.     I hope you join Ballet and have fun with it.....    P.S.-You don't get into Pointe after one year. It takes a couple years to get to that point.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	The pros are definitely the discipline you learn. You figure out how you body moves in space, and so much about anatomy as a whole. Its such a great experience to learn dance. You meet great people sharing the same interests. Along with that you learn musicality and an appreciation for the arts.    The only con is that you may become a little too hard on yourself. I'm telling you now, be happy with what your body provides you to do everyday. Ballet is hard, but its great that you have the confidence to start it.    You're one tough cookie!
AE2iQVKRaa	Africa was the last continent to be conquered by Europeans. They had already conquered a large part of the rest of the world before the 19th century. If Europeans had been aware of the natural resources before (e.g. gold and diamonds in South-Africa and Congo), Africa would have been conquered sooner. The industrial revolution helped Europe in overwhelming the African populations, but Europeans had better armament even before this period.
c1yfnzuVaa	1) Rainford was a bit...surprised and frightened. He was on his guard, obviously, since it came as a great surprise to find a castle on this random island. Not to mention, a rather foreboding castle with a pack of crazy, men-chasing dogs in the back. General Zaroff is very peculiar - and it doesn't help his image that he is tall, frightening in appearance, akin to a Russian military officer, and has the heads of animals all over his walls.    2) Zaroff got bored so he decided to hunt people. Plus he lives almost virtually by himself on an unnamed island. What isn't creepy and shocking?    Did you read the story?

Life is hard but I think it is only a part of it.    Of course, life is not meaningful. All of us here have something to live for - goals, dreams, love and such.

Yeah, we all work five days a week just to get two days off. Sometimes people aren't even that lucky. I know we could die at any moment and that sucks to. (kinda makes me feel like I should get in debt and buy everything I can) But your looking at it all wrong. If people tell you that you need a long term plan then that's their wrong. No one person can tell you how to live your life. I do think that some aspects of life are stupid but that does not mean that I want to just give up on life. You only take out of this world what you brought in. Do things that you enjoy. To me it looks like someone is trying to tell you how to live your life. Just look at it like guidance but you don't have to do it.|`|jN0njYgjaa	ive thought of that but, if life goes so fast, lets enjoy every second of it until we depart from this world.|`|WTqeubeWaa	I think my life is meaningless if I don't meet Jesus and receive Him as my personal savior.

sszJ6u76aa	If you're asking how can you put yourself in the place of the character you're writing about or the character that's telling the story in your book, I would recommend just picturing it in your mind.  That's what I do, I imagine every detail of the person and the background, practically like filming your own movie but in your mind. Like how when you're reading a book, you get lost in the words and you lose yourself, like you're pulled away from reality for a second.  So, try to make it like that for yourself, try to make it seem intriguing...maybe write a few chapters then read them over and see if you find it interesting yourself.    Hope I helped =)                          Jay|`|blwDnJy4aa	I'm no fantastic writer either, but this is what I do. My characters start off exactly like me at first, and then as I continue to write, they become someone else. I write about things I know, things that I feel strongly about, things I wonder about often and wonder who it will work out.    Here's what you do. When you write, just write out whatever the hell your mind tells you (but stay on topic). Then come back and edit it, polish it up. Writers doubt themselves often, take it from Libba Bray and Stephenie Meyer. They doubted themselves "at least once every 15 minutes." (I think that was Libba who said that).    Writing has no limits. Anything you want can happen, and honey, all you have to do is make it happen. When you're really passionate about something, you'll do whatever it takes to make it happen. Take a page out of Romeo and Juliet, and think about how Romeo did everything he had to in order to make Juliet his wife. And think of all the risks, the dangers, the near-death experiences. Sure, the ending wasn't a happy one, but the point is Romeo went out and did it. He didn't let anything stop him. Be like Romeo and make it happen.|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	Well to address being "in" the story most writers write about what they know. Edgar Allen Poe was a sad sad man and it shows in his writings.  Try writing about things you know. Another suggestion would be writing fan fiction on a site like Fanfiction.net or a forum for your favorite celebrity.   You can out yourself in the story and that will help you feel more connected to it. As well as getting feedback from people.   I write fanfiction myself. Thats how I got my start and I'd say I'm doing pretty well.     Hope I helped!|`|HgOg091Taa	HI,    My writing experience has been in the field of technical writing in past years, however, the principles are much the same.  First and foremost, you must know your subject well.  If you are writing a narrative story, you need to know where you're going with the story and hopefully how it will end before you begin.  As a "story teller", you are basically doing the same thing an actor does when they prepare for a movie or play.  They must put themselves into their character in order to be believable on screen or stage.  When one is writing in the first person they must do the same thing.  Perhaps you have been writing in the second or third person which would explain why you have difficulty "putting yourself into the story".  If you are attempting to write a fictional tale and having difficulties with it, you might write a brief biography about yourself since you know that entire story from the very beginning up to where you are at this point in your life.    I did a great deal of technical writing as a government contractor after retiring from the U.S. Navy and wrote a Corvette troubleshooting guide which I publish and sell through many Corvette parts vendors around the country which is a bit different than writing a novel, biography, autobiography, etc.    Hope this helps!    Chris|`|0tZxZijGaa	Use a writing journal. Whenever you get an idea, for the story or the character, write it in this journal. Soon enough you will find that as you dig deeper into the plot you unlock more of your characters past, and you will feel more like the character. I used to have the same problem. You just really have to get into it, no distractions, write on paper not a computer if that helps.|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Well, i am a young writer too and one way I connect with my character, id pretending that I am the character myself.What would I do?What would I say?

Maybe you can write in fictionpress.net or fanfiction.net   I have several =]|`|Mv986L0uaa	You need inspiration to write! And I'm a young writer as well, teheh. I've been through your situation before. The thing is, you probably need ideas on how to write about your character and where the story is going, right? First of all, you need to go deep into the details of your character. One thing that always helps me is by listing the physical characteristics of your character. Ex: May is tall, long hair and she has ruby red eyes. You could also list your character's personalities like,"May is a kind-hearted person who always gives and never want anything in return but she can be stubborn sometimes." If none of this isnt working, you can always google "anime" on the pictures for more ideas. It just gives you ideas on what your character will look like.     Second of all, you need to list some of the character's friends or families that's going to be included in your story. Or..well, you can just list in case you need it.    Third: Maybe try to think of the plot story or the problem to your story. A good story needs a problem. And you can use what my English teacher calls,"BUT-SO'S to create a problem.  Example: May wants to find out what happened to her dead friend BUT someone does not want her to find out. SO May tries to investigate whose behind all this BUT someone gets in her way of finding out SO May tries to figure out a plan to avoid being  superstitious...and etc. This must be a very bad example, I wish I knew how to explain it more, but oh wells.     Well, there is much more to this. But the sources and links that I listed explain much more better than I do. I wish you luck on your story!!|`|E9KYlG9kaa	You could make the character more like you or write in first person.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	I can get you free writing lessons 3 times a week for no charge depending on you age and it is over the internet teaches you how to edit and write.|`|ZW0La7M7aa	Sometimes it helps to just throw yourself into the writing of a scene in the story you *do* have a vision for, and find how your protagonist reacts to that situation.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Write down everything about the main subject , is it a male / female , their name , looks , age , likes / dislikes , where they live / what they do for work , just keep adding as much as you can to the subject are they married or alone , their family and friends , try and make the subject come alive , as if you really know them , it may help with your problem .

Is it a photo?  Text-only?  What's the subject?  How big?  Where are you putting it up?    General poster/advertising advice:    1. Don't use red as a background.  It looks like black when the lights are very dim.  Making any text illegible.  2. Use bold wording so the text can be read from far away.  3. Sharp contrasts.  Bright colors on dark backgrounds (or vice versa) are more attracting to the eye.  4. If including humans, try to employ active poses and not immobile standing pictures.  Think comic-book poses instead of prom picture photos.    5.

Tx8JHmDvaa	the message of not giving up even when the situation looks dire.    In Night, Elie is always trying to stay alive. he never gives up and goes to the crematories. he is always on a look out to find away to survive no matter the cost. He always finds a way to live.    In the Odyssey, Odysseus never gives up hope of him going home. Even though it takes him years, he never loses faith. He faces every obstacle with the determination to see through it so that he can reach home and see Penelope.    hope that was what you were looking for!
AA11640951	Having worked at both Borders and Barnes & Noble, I have to say the sensor machines are a bit worthless.  The way it works is small magnetic strips wedged into books either at the store or warehouse.  On items like CD's or DVD's, they are more plainly visible as magnetic stickers.  The store has pads near the registers which employees use to "desensitize" an item once it's purchased.     The problem is many stores and even libraries have similar devices, so if an employee forgets or if a pad fails to desensitize something, it's going to go off at places which have the same kind of security.      Employees are trained to ask for a receipt and check if the person is carrying anything else that may set off the sensor, but unless the theft was seen, can't stop a person...so technically one could say they got the book elsewhere and walk out.  However, stores do check video and repeat offenders are usually recognized and caught.
CsWwecBLaa	It makes people think about things, and it allows you to express yourself in so many different ways. It makes you see life in a deeper perspective.|`|p2jBCUU6aa	To put simply art is one of the greatest and oldest forms of human expression. It also documents history. Think back to before the age of photography (photography also being an art form), outside of writing, there was no other way except for art to document the historic evolution (or downfall) of cultures, societies, empires, countries, etc... Even today one can trace the progression of history through the works that have been recently created or those that are currently being created.    To collect art or simply view it, is also a way for humans to express themselves even if the viewer has not created it himself. Quite often people can view a work of art and personally indentify with it's imagery, symbolic or representational value (or even non representational).|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Art is one of the reasons that we wonder at the human capability. To look at a painting, to view a sculpture, to listen to music played, these are things that we wonder about the genius that is us. I don't think that artists of any stripe can truly appreciate their own works.

AA11442722	The richness of the sound and the timbre really. The heavier the gage the richer the tone you'll get. The lighter the gage the brighter the tone you'll get. So med gage is a trade off between the two. Getting some of the brightness of lighter gage strings with the richness of the med gage.     I don't believe there is any difference in volume between gages. If anything lighter gage strings should have more volume as they'll vibrate more easily. To me the difference is undetectable. In terms of sustain again the difference to me is undetectable.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Medium strings tend to give a fuller, richer tone and more volume than light gauge strings.

Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.  Please try and keep your share ratio above 1.1 when you get in.    You may find this tool useful, it's called Tracker Checker and you can leave it running in the background - http://www.stamcar.com/2007/07/25/tracke...  If you use this tool you will need to edit a few trackers, the Demonoid one needs the 'find string' changing from 'sername' to 'Desired username'    Hope this helps.
brEa9fFDaa	why cant you read breaking dawn?     it's the logest of the series so there's alot to explain.   ill explain some of it though..and if you want i can email you the book...ive written it down on my word thing thing so that i could read it on my computer..when i dont have my book with me.     OK so edward and bella get married of course..and on there honeymoon bella seduces edward..i hope you know what that means.   she gets pregnant.... and they cant convince her to let them take out the baby. it's like half vampire half human..  it uses it's teeth to tear out of the mother's stomach.  Bella starts to die because of the baby cuz it's taking all the nutrients away from her..so she has to drink blood..and she get's healthier.  well jacob finds out and wants to kill edward and the baby inside of bella.  finally when it breaks her spine they have to get it out or bella will die.  edward...rosalie..and jacob help.  the baby is suffacating and rosalie starts cutting open bella's stomach with a scapel well when she sees blood coming out rosalie gets thirsty and is about to kill bella.  then edward evantually gets the baby out.....but bella isnt breathing anymore.  edward plunges a syringe with his poisen into her heart and then bites her everywhere.  the wrist neck...anywhere he can get the pioson  jacob..cant stand it anymore and leaves when he gets down stairs he thinks about killing the baby...rosalie has it now  but when he sees her he cant kill her.    he imprinted on her.   three long days later bella wakes up as a beatiful vampire.   when she demands to see her daughter..... she starts to wonder why jacob is looking at her child like he's a man looking at the sun for the first time.   then she figures out that he imprinted on her and she attacks him.  she doesnt kill him..but seth breaks his arm.     ok well...thats not all of the book...theres still alot more to explain...but there's to much.     hope this helps a little.   it's realy intresting.     if your freinds have the book why dont you read theres.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	her parents won't let her read it because Stephanie Meyer's psychopath, weird behind talks about Bella and Edward's sex life so much in it.

I'll give the overview. Bella and Edward get married, they have a little girl named Renesseme. Jacob then imprints on Renesseme and Bella gets mad. Then, the Vouitri come because Irina, from Tanya's family sees Renesseme and thinks shes a full vampire child when she's half human too becasue Bella had her when she was still human. And before Bella dies, Edward changes her into a vampire. When the Vouitri come, Bella learns that she has a shield and protects everyone. Then, they convince Aro that Renesseme is half vampire because Renesseme has a talent where she can show people what shes thinking, and so she shows Aro everything. In the end, everyone is happy and Edward can read Bella's mind because her shield can allow Edward to read her mind. Oh, and the middle of the book, it switches over to Jacob's point of view.|`|rh2toYSZaa	Yep. Aly is right.. and irina [i think] dies. :D  also, WHY wont your parents let you read it?|`|YRmjoluqaa	She pretty much summed it all up. That's crazy your parents let you read the other three, but not this one!!! You really should read it!|`|fLHV3pmuaa	No. Listen to your family. Stephenie Meyer is the worst writer on the face of the Earth. You should be thanking them for not letting you read that rubbish. She uses 29389 adverbs in every sentence, and she repeats the same words over and over again. Like "chagrin" and "mumbled." Reading Twilight causes me to experience actual physical pain.
FIbTFKzoaa	I like Black and White.  But usually I write the book then pick the name. This way the Title reflects the book, which is very important.  How I would start a story would be by thinking of a good idea on what to write. Write what would happen. (the major events and anything else important) Then pick characters and names. Write on seperate sheets of paper everything from their looks to their personality.    hope this helps.. and remember, just write :)|`|aXEBolkJaa	I just started writing and Im 13  Im creating a book  go to blurb.com  you can create your book for free  and get it published for as little as $4.95 NO JOKE  you can also sell it and manage prices  when selling you do not need to purchase more than one book unlees you want  it is a great site and simple to use  Good luck|`|fakoqZwiaa	I would write the book before giving it a title, the title should fit the book. If you make a title, the book might end up going in a totally different direction and you might want to change it.|`|sRw9oiQdaa	I advise you to just start.  You can get someone to edit it afterwards, but if you never write anything down it will never get done.  Start your story and see where it goes.  Chances are you will write some stuff that is better off left out of your finished book, but you will have some that is for keeps.  That is the beauty of computer word processors.  You can always delete after the fact.|`|TffCSzHxaa	I like the title Black and white. You'd probably want to make a book about vampires. Those books are pretty popular these days. If you do that you could call it Black and Red.|`|2hQFdy08aa	sketch out a few characters.  Get a main character and figure out how s/he would act in certain situations.  Give him something he wants more than anything else.  This is a really broad definition =) throw obstacles, internal and external, in his way.  Have an idea of how he is different at the end.  Plan out your story in scenes on note cards.  You can start writing the story at any point in the planning proccess.  I normally like to plan 2 or 3 scenes ahead to keep me on track.      don't worry about the title now.  Your idea will form as you write.|`|rNSM38Jaaa	First, I would think what you want to book to be about, start letting your ideas flow and you'll be writing. If you can't think of anything, start jotting down ideas. I would get the story going before I get the title, unless you have everything planned out first. Start getting an outline going, then adding detail and going into further details and chapters, characters etc..
7KcVSB3Uaa	Do you mean a long dash? It looks like this--except that it's a solid line, not dotted?

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Bad idea - plaster gets hot as it sets and it is not good for the skin anyway.  What you should get is sold as moulage or alginate and it is a vegetable (seaweed) derivative that is heated and brushed on with straws in your nose thus getting cooler as it sets.  It is soft and flexible so before taking off the face, a backing of plaster or plaster bandage is added to provide a stiff support - the plaster is pulled off, then the face mold which is set in the backing and plaster is poured into the face mold to make a copy of your face.      Look up theatrical makeup and maybe disaster simulation - much of the online sources are about making wounds for fake injuries in practice drills.
ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	1. The preferred font and size by literary agents and publishers is Times New Roman at size 12.    2. Simply apply one-inch margins top, bottom, and to the sides to facilitate the number of words. Do not provide a right, clean edge, but make it ragged.    3.  Page breaks are usually one line apiece.    4.  Chapter and numbers are usually at the left. The manuscript title is in upper case and centered.    5.  It matters not how the manuscript is spaced during the draft creations. Simply format the manuscript to be submitted in double spacing. Let the computer do it for you and do not manually double-space the lines.    Your best option is to find the booklet, "Formatting & Submitting Your Manuscript" by Cynthia Laufenberg. You won't go wrong in using the samples provided in your submissions.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Times New Roman 12 point double spaced with 1" margins on all sides.  If you do this, you will have the proper amount of words to a page which should be roughly around 200-250 words.      Page Breaks:  There is a setting in Microsoft word that does page breaks for you at the end of chapters.  For breaks between scenes, you should use three asterisk for scene change and one for POV change.    When you formant your chapter settings, MS will automatically set the size for you.  All you need to do is set whether you want left, right or center.      Any more questions, glad to answer!    Blessings!

R5UIMBvcaa	My personal favorite is one that's not usually read in survey classes--The Franklin's Tale.  I like it because it deals with a happy marriage, and all the characters behave nobly.  The Franklin is described as a cheerful, hospitable person, someone who sees the good side of life, and this is the kind of tale one would expect him to tell.    However, if you're also thinking about the contest that the host proposes, that the pilgrim whose tale is voted best will be treated to dinner by the others when they return, I'd have to say that the winner would probably have been either the Wife of Bath or the Pardoner.  Her tale makes you want to cheer (at least if you're a woman), and his makes you shiver.|`|mHeQLRJ1aa	The Millers Tale, I stupidly like how crude it is as it's being said from a millers point of view, the obvious toilet humour when being read in a seemingly more subtle articulate fashion seemed funnier as just descriving it by todays standards :P|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale    Study Guides:    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/canterbury...    http://pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeyno...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...

CFE4F3eUaa	Both speakers are sympathetic to Nature. The second speaker is just more content, while the first speaker feels out of place in modern society. The first speaker criticizes people for ignoring Nature in the modern age. People ignore the sea, the winds; they are unmoved by nature. The speaker would rather be a Pagan who worships nature-based gods like Proteus and Poseidon. In the second poem, the speaker seems to be expressing his lifelong love of Nature. However, the second speaker does say "and I could wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety." If he's wishing, then perhaps it's not true that they are bound by Nature. Perhaps the speaker wishes Nature was an even larger part of his life, similar to the first speaker. But what do I know...

Some books i really enjoyed were    A Child Called It  Th1reteen R3asons Why  Someone Like You  The Outsiders|`|1LhZgZllaa	beverly cleary is classic    or this one called "who left that hair in my toothbrush", ive read it twice!|`|y53vt9reaa	Vampire Academy series - Richelle Mead  Morganville Vampires series - Rachel Caine  Impossible - Nancy Werlin  House of Night series - P.C. and Kristen Cast  Wicked Lovely - Mellisa Marr  Society of S - Susan Hubbard  Speak - Laurie Halse Anderson  Deadly Little Secret - Laurie Faria Stolarz  Beauty - Robin McKinley  A Certain Slant of Light - Laura Whitcomb  City of Bones - Cassandra Clare  Tithe - Holly Black  Sweep series - Cate Tiernan  Revealers - Amanda Marrone  Outlander series - Diana Gabaldon  Garden Spells and The Sugar Queen - Sarah Addison Allen
kY0l0Xq3aa	Scarlett Is immense  4/5    Life on the refridgerator door  Well it's a pretty sad book  Only read it if your ok with that  4/5    It's really good just sad      Georgie  Xxx
8di0rKm1aa	its a good book, but i prefer "it" or the stand|`|uKCu2sosaa	i think it's definitely worth reading. i really liked that book.|`|dbd2834e320ef2c4df6f6bb2a6eb951eaa	Its a pretty good book. Its written like a fairy tale and has connections to he Dark Tower Series, which is why I really liked it. So if you have read the Dark Tower Series or plan on it, definitely read this book.|`|nFakIvgoaa	I remember really liking it.  It has been many years since I read it, however, so I need to read it again to refresh my memory of the storyline.  I would say that it is definitely worth your time though!
8di0rKm1aa	both books are boring as hell  read "we" its a good dystopian novel|`|1LhZgZllaa	there is a book called utopia thats a dysutopia, brave new world too    personally im a big fan of atlas shrugged, i got so hooked and even though its a long book its worth it.  you will rethink capitalism after that one|`|1oh4BN32aa	Not good at all.    And 1984 isn't boring but if you want another good example, the classic one is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.|`|vmmMqhxXaa	I haven't read "The Fountainhead."  "Atlas Shrugged" is a profound work that is unpopular today because it isn't politically correct.  It is also ponderous by today's standards, and I barely managed to slog through it, so don't feel bad.  For an easier novel on the "isms" of capitalism, socialism, communism, and totalitarianism, read George Orwell's brilliant satyre "Animal Farm."      Both deal with the suppression of the free market in the interest of "fairness" -- which often turns out to be what is "fair" for those who aren't motivated to earn.  As one of the pigs says, "All are created equal, but some are more equal than others."
kI5WZAHTaa	nathaniel hawthorne, though not gothic in the way u mean.|`|AT6PbAQ2aa	Well its funny you should ask I Drizzle consider myself to be a self proclaimed american gothic poet. This is my latest piece. Roses are Red Violets are blue, Yo mama be Ugly and so is you"       You like it? Sweet huh? No but seriously, I am really a self proclaimed amercan gothic poet, but I'm more than that. I am a self proclaimed supernatural, shamanistic, american gothic poetical, dream warrior. My job is to infuse the unchained beast in man with the eloquent enigmatic nonextisence of the superconscience of mans super ego. If that makes sense to you then it all does baby. F'n Groovy, man pass me another glass of that electric blue cool-ade. This is far out!       If you still don't believe me, I will give you a poem that I wrote many years ago, and it will probably give me away, but who cares, and the poem I've titled is Manchild       Into myself without a doubt       Storms of fear, and inward cloud       Chaos rules inside my mind       Once a child now left behind       The time of trial is in my eyes       I die know time to realize       warm and safe unknowingly sweet,       to leave the shelter, and lose the heat.       Oppressive pleasure, my vital spark.       relolving intentions, I'm in the dark.       Sustained by laughter, my sole lost seed.       The child I'm after, an essential need.       Yes, its me, and its actually a song, but now I have given myself away. So if your teacher asks,you tell him, Drizzle is right up there. If you don't want to use Drizzle, I am also known as Maximus Helios Avante, or Anton. If your teacher don't like it. Tell him I said he can go to hell. No, I'm kidding. Maximus Helios Avante, you can't get any more american Goth than that.
f2cQrG7jaa	People who know what they want will regret it later. Not knowing is where the change occurs. Love to hate it, or just hate it if you want, but for what purpose? Being lost is being in change. Being in conflict is resisting that change. Actively changing is also being in conflict. Let your environment feed you it's energy and that will change you. Don't do anything ABOUT it. Doing nothing because of it is resistance to something, but doing nothing with the information changes the information for you. Confusion = progress|`|AA11503678	Just relax and listen to this song    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jek6iP6Au...    then think about your srengths, ability and what do you most enjoy in life.

Also, what are you best at? Most of the time, we spend more time on things that we are interested in or love, becoming better at it.  There are also guidance tests that you can take to identify your strengths.     Don't waste your time taking classes for a major until you know it's what you want, unless someone else is paying for it! You have no hurry, enjoy school while your there.  Some people like college so much, they get masters and doctorate degrees, and eventually never leave, becoming teachers.     If you can't afford to go to school extra years take some time off, and try out different jobs. Take all kinds of different courses until you find something you like.  And its not like your going to be stuck with that degree and in a career you don't like.  A lot of people go back to school, get unrelated degrees and change career's later in life.|`|UMsJd9bDaa	Try going to the gym and working out a lot.

kfOpbbCyaa	If you enjoy horror, try Dean Koontz's only true horror novel: Phantoms. (He did write a couple of Frankenstein titles, too, which I haven't read.)    If you like unusual, try The Face or From the Corner of His Eye.    If you like apocalyptic/post apocalyptic, try The Taking.    If you enjoy the character being in the wrong place at the wrong time, try The Good Guy or The Husband. Velocity might work, too.    If potential aliens are your thing, try One Door Away from Heaven. (This one, though I really enjoyed it, is slow in parts but worth continuing.)    You've been told about Odd Thomas already, which was excellent and Odd is a great character. Two others with a very likeable character are the Christopher Snow novels: Fear Nothing and Seize the Night.    If you are interested in a variation of the time travel theme, Lightning might be one you appreciate.    Whispers is another one you might want to check out. It is about a woman who is attacked in her own home. She wounds the man, who later dies. After his death, she is attacked again, by the same man.    I have been told that False Memory and Hideaway are both good, but I haven't read them yet.    Since you loathed Watchers, I'm assuming you are not as enamored of dogs as I am, so I wouldn't suggest one of his books that features a dog. (The Christopher Snow books do have a dog, but Christopher is the main character.)    In my opinion, Dean Koontz is a good storyteller, but not everyone appreciates him (including some whose opinions I truly respect). If you try another of his books and again it doesn't appeal, I'd recommend moving on to another author whose works -do- capture your interest. Isn't it nice that the world is full of books and everyone can find something which delights?|`|SYKGIiQkaa	I always thought he was pretty much diet-coke Stephen King. Try his 'Odd' series, I hear good things.|`|rSbsj3tgaa	I hear good things about Dean Kootz, and I just started Darkest Hour of the Night. I like it so far, maybe you should check it out.    LuthienT|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	I like Scott Sigler more but really liked Dean Koontz Odd Thomas and Brother Odd as well as Life Expectancy. I didn't like Velocity as much.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	he cant write to save his life,i read a book about him about a clown who tried to kill a man and kidnap his son, it was utter rubbish, i will never read another book by him.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	Odd Thomas Odd Thomas Odd Thomas!    But don't bother with the sequels.     This one's really well-done. Well, at least I thought so.     I tried Velocity and a few of his other mystery novels, but I couldn't quite get into them. As far as I know this is his only good book. It flows nice and keeps you reading despite its somewhat purpular prose. Odd is quite a character.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	That is my favourite author!!!  Try "False Memory" or "Intensity" or "The Good Guy"...okay i will stop now but yeah, I haven't read "Watchers" but most of his books are really good!|`|daza5A4vaa	He's pretty dreadful.  I read Watchers a few years back and was shocked. I'd heard good things, but I wasn't impressed.  You have more faith than I do, I haven't picked up a Koontz book since.    I'd stick to King.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	Try Velocity or Intensity ,but my favorite so far is Life Expectancy it really is the best book ever in my opinion. I've read all his books too.

It is a long, hard road, and the journey gets longer, the longer you wait.    No one starts at the top... you simply start... and the key is to keep going.|`|CivfnBR4aa	Don't worry, I'm an actress myself and I know what your going through. The fact that your thinking about going out and looking for work and an agent shows, on some level, that you are ready.  Honestly though, you won't ever be 100 percent sure if your ready, but that's when you got to have faith in your craft and what you've learned and take the plunge.
m7M6DYnaaa	It's a toss up between jealousy and greed. Greed makes us do things that we may not normally do, like steal or what not. But jealousy is just as damaging, because it causes us to act out when we see someone else with something we want.    So to be honest, jealousy and greed go hand in hand, so I will have to say both; you cannot seperate the two.|`|Fpi8YePkaa	It is not in my personal life but neighbors and people need to get rid of racism totally and completely.|`|xeYNNoxfaa	Needless guilt, I would like to not worry about disappointing others.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Ummm....

Pain for dogs    Pain from someone being jealous and causing trouble for you    Pain, when you lose a loved one and your heart is broken into pieces    Pain, that is caused when someone says hurtful things    Pain, from the loved ones lost in war, and you have to explain to their children, daddy is not coming home again.    Pain when everything just seems to pile up on people and all they can do is cry and wonder, why is this happening to me...    Pain of losing your only child, parents are not suppose to outlive their children.....

dQmFoRRiaa	If I could with a word well-chosen tell  You of the mysteries I've come to know  In sweet-sad murmurs of the vesper bell,  My throttled tongue would then so overflow  With tales of timeless, soft, supernal glow  That visions, gray and mundane, all have seen  (That mark and mock our outer life below)  Would be repealed, as if a stubborn screen  Had been dissolved; and all that lies between   The parclose paling of the piece-bright world  And what is masked  the pure and ever green   Would then pour forth, as through a thin wall thurled.  The truth I've glimpsed, and yet no words are found,  And so by failing silence I am bound.    This silence that's become my sole estate  Has come of late to blur what's real and dreamed;  I have been set adrift to navigate  On seas that are, and are not, what they seemed.  For I have seen the center still that's teemed   Beneath the veil that not one soul denies,  And by its sight am both damned and redeemed  In ways I could not hope to analyze,  But which have in a strange way made me wise,  Though by their awful loneliness I'm swept   Their wisdom seems all language to despise;  So often in my longing have I wept.   These are the poles that I am drawn between,  And yet how could you know quite what I mean?    While walking once along a country lane  I spied a bucket, weatherworn and bare,  Which time and circumstance half-filled with rain.  And on its waters I became aware  Of a lone beetle's silent voyage there,  And in it, mirrored, life's experience;  And now I see such visions everywhere   I've not dared glimpse the oaken bucket since.  I'm tortured and yet blessed by Providence;  It's come to shake my wakefulness with sights  That pierce me utterly and make no sense.  And what were once my pleasures and delights,  And were for my whole life the goal and sum,  Now exile me to lands where words can't come.    A golden sunset makes my words quite fail,  A crippled child and country road, the same;  In all I sense the same soul-making vale  And know its grandeur full, yet not its name.  And not once did I beckon it, it came  And poisoned me 'til I could speak no more.  Daylight's dull web and I are one and same   The empty mask that hangs beside the door.  Have I been made the sole inheritor  Of things I know, but never can explain?   Mere circumstance has scourged me to the core;  With folded hands I slowly go insane.  I've seen God's greatness, but it has been planned  That I not speak of what I understand.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	roses are red   violets are blue  that guy copied the poem i wrote for you.|`|suv94efAaa	roses are red,violets are blue  i like you and i hope you like me to
heF3HIzQaa	Man makes history. History shapes but does not make man.    As far as we know, the idea of recording and investigating our past is unique to humans.

FoIxsunVaa	If you believe in prayer, that is a good place to start.    Otherwise or in addition to prayer:  1. Take as good care of yourself as you can so you can be more useful and helpful.  2. When you see her, quietly ask her if there is anything you can do for her. (same for the other family members in need.)  3. Do what you can to make the household run smoother.  4. Try and offer positive insight on the situation WHEN ASKED. Trying to sort out other people's emotions when they DON'T ASK can be trying and irritating.   5. Remind everyone in your family of the love and bond you feel for each other. These things may be getting forgotten due to all the guilt and pain.    I will pray for you and your family, and I wish you luck and strength to be helpful for your family.|`|K2pdxaadaa	I'm so sorry! That's very sad.     The only advice I could give you is to be of no extra bother to her. Be there when she needs you, and no more.     I'd also get some blood work done for yourself. This is obviously affecting you as well and it would be wise to rid the possibility of this disease.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	I think that the more confused someone is the better. IF that confusion triggers some depressing concept then the concept should be analyzed. Worrying and confusion aren't related inherently. It's the mind who is uncomfortable with the confusion and tries to combat it with depression which doesn't help. You can't help her, she's the only one who can help herself. I think that she can deconstruct previous presumptions through your willingness to communicate with her no matter where she takes it. Unconditional approval.|`|2r8iRceQaa	Suffer little children come unto me.  I'm sorry for all that you and your family are going through. Just remember that God will never put anything on you that you or your family cannot handle. Be strong for your family and be there when they need someone to talk to. Hold their hands and pray with them and for them. God Bless.|`|1iWNBBMfaa	Your story is so sad, I'm very sorry for you all.    I don't know really how to help you but by stressing that guilt is not in any way an appropriate feeling. I know -from experience- that you can feel guilty for things you can't possibly have influenced but this makes it hard to share your feelings and that is what you all need.    You need to share it together but also with others. It is often difficult to share this as a family because you are likely to be afraid your own feelings will make the other feel even more miserable. Someone else might be better then.  I think it would be wise to let your mother and grandpa know that you don't blame them in any way: that is the best I can think of.    I wish you all a lot of strength!|`|NpZPYhaRaa	I am sorry. It is sad.  Well, I believe in talking. Sometimes a little talk changes everything and lifts some burdens. Talk to your mom and to your grandfather that being likely the giver does not mean 100% certitude. Anyways, doctors are not always 100% right. And it is not that your grandfather did something on purpose. What is important is that you guys are together and are going to take care and support each other. And tell your mom not to get worried because you will see a doctor in the near future not now because you guys have already a lot to deal with (I think it would just add more stress to the situation and it would not change a thing).|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Good advice from Arria.  You and your family are in my prayers.
snrdDbLAaa	Well, think about the history of poetry; it began mixed with song and dance.  Then isn't it peculiar for a `modern' poet to write a poem about a song which was never even composed, nor sung by a human intelligence?  (Keats is modern in the sense that he writes with a pen for a printing press, and not for a live audience.)     Keats's ode is anti-logical; it objects to Shakespeare's delight in paradox, for example, because it sees this aspect of Shakespeare as the most superficial.  Keats admires the free play of sensitive thought, which in this poem he likens to the unthinking music of the bird.  As the bird sings, he envisions his own death as an apotheosis of art-- his imitation of nature lost in the true song of the nightingale.      In this sense, life is transient, and even the art of the poet is transient; but the poet will not believe that art is transient.  Thus, the poem immortalises the the song, just as Shakespeare's sonnets insisted they immortalised the the recipient's beauty.  But unlike Shakespeare, who vulgarly insisted on the transcendence of his own art (see sonnet 123, towards the end of the sequence: `No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change...'), Keats uses the artifice of the poem to stress the permanence of the poem's object, superseding both the poet and the poem itself.    Does this help answer your question?|`|DHdK3vVoaa	Basically, your question asks you to analyze different interpretations of this poem. One angle has been to take the bird as a symbolic artist who creates immortal art. The other has been to describe the transience of life, how precious it is to make music while the we (the bird) still lives.    It might make more sense if I talk about each stanza...    The poet falls into a reverie while listening to an actual nightingale, whose song causes him to feel intense joy, pain (hemlock, a poison), and numbness (dull opiate). The song is so powerful that the poet compares it to the river Lethe in Hades, waters that had the power to make people forget their past lives. The poet also calls the nightingale a Dryad, a mythical creature that is connected to nature (specifically trees) and music.    Wanting to escape and join the nightingale, the poet calls for wine. He moves about in a world of his own fantasy, of summer, country pleasure, and romantic Provence. The kind of world he imagines the nightingale to inhabit. I really like the phrase "sunburnt mirth", a reference to country dances taking place outdoors. He is obviously seeking some state of mind that the alcohol will give him, perhaps the state of artistic inspiration? :)    However, the poet is jolted back to the real world. He reflects on the human condition, of death, of aging, and of despair ("leaden-eyed"! what heavy burdens!). Because the world of the nightingale is so tantalizingly different from the world of the poet's, his desire to escape the real world seems to intensify by the end of this stanza.    He suddenly cries out, "Away! Away! for I will fly to thee!" He turns to fantasy again, rejecting wine (Bacchus and his pards) and using the "viewless wings of Posey" (poetry) to join what is now a fantasy bird (your symbolic poet!). In choosing Posey over logical reasoning (the brain), the poet is rejecting a certain way of life. It might be interesting to mention what this is, and consider what things are associated with the heart as opposed to the brain. At the end of this stanza the poet appears to be successful in joining the bird, and is entranced into a new mode of experience. It is dark, but the night is lit up by stars. How sensuous!    The poet's impatience for summer is palpable. With his other senses, he can describe the richness of the natural surroundings even it is dark. The season is spring (the musk rose, a mid-May flower, has not yet bloomed) yet the poet is waiting to hear "murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves". There are also references to the changing (transience!) of the seasons, like "fast fading violets" and "coming of the musk rose".    Even in this refuge, Death is present. Recalling the first stanza, did the poet anticipate Death all along (using shadowy references such as "hemlock" and the river "Lethe")? The poet begins to distance himself from the nightingale, yearning for death. He imagines death to be only joyful and free of pain, a way to merge with the song of the nightingale. However, in the last two lines, the poet no longer identifies with the bird. He realizes what death means for him, which is essentially non-existence. Death is not release from pain, an inability to feel the bird's bliss. Note the contrast between the bird's singing and the poet's hearing of that song, which he now calls "a requiem". He had heard that song very differently earlier in the poem.    The poet moves from awareness of his own mortality to the perception of the bird's immortality. On a literal level, the poet is wrong; but the bird has now become a symbol for him. (Or for poets, the bird could represent the imaginary realm that inspires them.) Perhaps what he has heard is immortal, an ideal and untouched beauty that continues as a species as well as a symbol of the continuity of nature (life) itself. He contrasts the immortality of the bird with the condition of human beings, "hungry generations".    Another interesting question: Is the nightingale not born for death in the sense that, unlike human beings, it doesn't know it's going to die? An implication of this reading is that the bird is integrated into nature or is part of natural processes whereas humans operate in a separate sphere from nature (cities). The resulting ability to observe nature gives us the ability to appreciate the beauty of nature, however transitory it may be.    I hope this helped.|`|y3WEpmw3aa	Sorry, i am a beginner with poems so i don't understand yours.. im sorry. but it sounds great! something i have never heard of before..

I dont really know what your style is but you can never go wrong with a pair of nice jeans and a cute top. Nothing over the top because its not a formal dance or anything..

AA12318686	Hey Tiger 18 !    This poem really touched my heart !  So, you're feeling down... ' been there myself.      I think that the trouble is that you are looking at yourself with a magnifying glass, you are aware of every flaw, and not only that, but the flaws appear to be much bigger than they really are!  Tiger, you are way too hard on yourself. Nobody is perfect.   Maybe you could start looking at yourself from the inside, like an X Ray. You will see what you're really made of. Take a look at what's in your heart, your soul, etc. What's there ?  Treasures ! That's what others see when they tell you you are smart and talented. You can't see the treasures inside with a  mirror and through your magnifying glass, just wrapping and a label. What is really more important? The wrapping and label or the treasure inside?  Put the mirror and the magnifying glass away and start enjoying the treasure that you are !   I believe that your family and friends and you will be alot happier !    Tiger, unwrap the gift that you are, discover and share the treasure that is within you.  Again, your poem touched my heart, but it is not finished yet, it needs a happy ending !  I will be watching for it !|`|fwZPEqwMaa	THIS IS GREAT! the ending was brilliant!!!|`|blbV8NKMaa	thats really good.|`|JV6NFr5Raa	nice poem

fy5gKCVZaa	I wouldn't classify it as a fantasy novel but The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is absolutely amazing! Of the ones on your list I think it is most similar to the Uglies Trilogy since it's futuristic, but it's a very different story. I couldn't put it down, just read it straight for 5 hours til I finished.     http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Suzan...

The "Women of the Otherworld" series is pretty entertaining, too.  I read the "So You Want to Be A Wizard" series a long time ago and it was a little confusing then, but still a series worth checking out!  The Chronicles of Narnia are classics, and I'm currently starting "The Gemma Doyle Trilogy" so I don't know how it is, but it def. looks interesting enough to check out!    Good luck!

It's not too much effort to just type things out ^_^  Answers also has a spell check feature to avoid embarrassing typos too.    *Cough* Anyway, on to books!  I like your selection, I've read a lot of these.  Emily Hopkins also has written "Identical" and since you have every other book of hers, I'm sure you'll like it (I haven't read it yet, but I plan to).  Keep going with Stephen King, too, that guy has an infinite amount of books (Have you read Carrie?  Misery?  Pet Semetary?  Those are the most recent ones I've read).  Also, Scott Westerfield has a bunch of great series (I recommend the Uglies trilogy + Extras, Midnighters, and maybe even Peeps). His are all science fiction-y, they sound like something you'd enjoy.  The "Great and Terrible Beauty" trilogy is probably something you'd like too, especially if you liked Harry Potter.    Ooh, you like Manga too! Let's see... Wolf's Rain is pretty good, and of course there's InuYasha (better than Naruto in my opinion, but I'm open to that too).  Chibi Vampire is good for a comedy with a really good plot (And it's vampires, come on XD).  Loveless is interesting, and some characters have animal ears (for a reason though!).  Do you like yaoi?  I could give you a bunch of recommendations there, but I understand if you don't.

O15my3olaa	They are not relating well with the people around them, not doing much in their daily life. Most things might not have turned out positive and they encounter all kinds of problems; they probably resigned themselves to staying indoors most of the time and doing things to hurt themselves, indulge in excessive drinking or drugs--just to escape from the unhappiness, stress of daily living. But the economic downturn this period, causing people to lose jobs, families is also to be blamed for this situation. Now is the time to remake, to be humble, to live simply, recycle things, or relocate--in a bid to make living more meaningful, and real.     They should really go and seek advice and turn their lives around, before some drastic things happen.|`|AA11564934	omg  They don't have a realisitic view of the world.|`|AA11488628	they do not live in the same world as the rest of us. ya know fantasy where nothing is real they do not live in the real world.

HjFisSCXaa	I agree with  Cetrew;   The fact that Louis still had a "heart" even as a vampire was one the key elements of the plot;    Guess I got a bit carried away with the quote; just pick what works for the monologue you had in mind.   - It's form the beginning of the book:      " And the harpsichord; that was lovely. My sister used to play it.  On summer evenings, she would sit at the keys with her back to the open French windows. And I can still remember that thin, rapid music and the vision of the swamp rising beyond her, the moss-hung cypresses floating against the sky.  And there were the sounds of the swamp, a chorus of creatures, the cry of the birds.  I think we loved it.  It made the rosewood furniture all the more precious, the music more delicate and desirable.  Even when the wisteria tore the shutters oft the attic windows and worked its tendrils right into the whitewashed brick in less than a year .  .  .  .       Yes, we loved it.  All except my brother.  I don't think I ever heard him complain of anything, but I knew how he felt.       My father was dead then, and I was head of the family and I had to defend him constantly from my mother and sister.  They wanted to take him visiting, and to New Orleans for parties, but he hated these things.  I think he stopped going altogether before he was twelve:   Prayer was what mattered to him, prayer and his leather-bound lives      " Finally I built him an oratory removed from the house, and he began to spend most of every day there and often the early evening.  It was ironic, really.  He was so different from us, so different from everyone, and I was so regular!  There was nothing extraordinary about me whatsoever.  " The vampire smiled.      " Sometimes in the evening I would go out to him and find him in  the garden near the oratory, sitting absolutely composed on a stone  bench there, and I'd tell him my troubles, the difficulties I had with the  slaves, how I distrusted the overseer or the weather or my brokers .  .  .  all the problems that made up the length and breadth of my existence.    And he would listen, making only a few comments, always sympathetic, so that when I left him I had the distinct impression he  bad solved everything for me.  I didn't think I could deny him  anything, and I vowed that no matter how it would break my heart to lose him, he could enter the priesthood when the time came.  Of  course, I was wrong.  " The vampire stopped.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	You could do the part where Louis talks about his brother's death.  It was a critical point in his actual life.  It's what makes him willing to take chances like dealing with a vampire.  I hated the part in the movie where they make his wife and child and not his brother.|`|7Gpb3Rosaa	The second book in the series (Vampire Lestat) has more fun monologues IMHO - especially when he digresses about the savage garden. But, you can basically take anything the main character says as a monologue - since the books are all in first person iirc.

GLS7vgAdaa	When I first began acting, I was the quietest, most backward girl in the class. Then I noticed that when I got up in front of everyone, I became transformed into something I was not. After many years of analyzing why and how I did this I realized that I used every character as a sort of mask. When i put this "mask" on or rather when I stepped into character, I knew it was no longer me in front of everyone. I was gone and only my character was in the room. Acting takes a nice mixture of imagination and reality to do properly. Your focus is key. Why should you care what anyone thinks of you? It isn't really you they're seeing. It gets really fun if you continue thinking like this. You feel you can do anything and be anyone...you just have to put that mask on before you even get out of the chair. The thing I loved most was that everyone initially was surprised that the quiet girl who never talked was the best in class and eventually it turned into a quiet excitement (for me AND them) each time it was my turn to perform. I got so much great feedback and in time, made a lot of good friends that helped me grow out of my shell. Just think...it's finally your time to shine!|`|8NO8f2ffaa	Act as if no one is watching.|`|OdhrnXaMaa	be your self. when you go up to act, think about what you would want to see if someone else had gone up. and then do that. people arn't suppose to judge you in drama class anyway, they're supposed to tbe supportive|`|agXiFgLTaa	Well just act yourself, and when people find the real "you" then you will start to get more friends in drama!|`|ztQSykXJaa	well it is drama no one will judge you for being dramatic... just be yourself and you'll make friends|`|dTOaRaGRaa	dr. seuss says 'be who u r because the people tht matter dont care and the people tht care dont matter'  i suggest starting simple with hellos smiles yadda yaddas and just be your self try to make simple convo and find things u have in comon|`|TXCoUGgpaa	This is my third year in Drama. I was shy at first to. You eventually begin to open up, but there are ways you can help. Don't be scared of anyone. They might be critical, but that is really because they are unsure of their own acting abilities. Don't worry about them. The teacher is sure to see that you are putting fourth your best effort and those other girls will be surprized when you start getting the parts you want. And make sure you practice being silly and goofy, or whatever emotion you are trying to portray by yourself in the mirror, before you try it in front of the class. Don't worry. You'll do awesome. Have confidence in yourself. ^-^|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	If you like role playing, you share with a lot of actors.  The drama queens want to be stars. So you need to find a role that you are comfortable in and can use as a basis - being yourself isn't going to work.  So look at actors you admire and "play" them.  I would suggest one who is quietly confident while doing a good job with roles.  From that floor/base extend your role into the requirements of the scene or play and make it your own.  You know you are better than they are and if you get criticism the first time, listen with an inner confidence and use any small bit that seems to make sense and ignore the rest.  But if you use the same method (or Method) with the second role and produce something different, you will shock them perhaps.  In drama class you will probably have a wider range of opportunities than for some time after.|`|0NCyqe2Qaa	Remember the reason you are attending this Acting class.

2e2f438d78517ad777fa3313fb112873aa	I think the objections raised against such ethical encampments are strong. Firstly, the ethical relativist must find a way to get around the is-ought fallacy. What is this? Obviously you've seen a ethical relativist say something like this: "Many cultures have different beliefs as to what is moral or not. Therefore, morals are relative to cultures". For instance, it is not moral for a woman in the middle eastern societies to show their face. Yet, this doesn't mean that this is they way it ought to be. Such people could be wrong about what is moral. Secondly, simply because many beliefs about morals exist doesn't mean that all such beliefs are equally valid. Many beliefs about the earth still exist. However, it has been scientifically proven that the earth is round, not flat. The planets revolve around the sun, and the sun does not revolve around the earth. Likewise, simply because many beliefs about morals exist doesn't mean all are equally valid. Thirdly, a problem for ethical subjectivism, can feelings actually determine the value of human actions? If so, how? Ethical Subjectivism says if something makes me feel good, then the action is good. For instance, like sex. If something makes me feel bad, then the actions is bad. Again, can feeling really determine the value of human actions?|`|AA11564934	it goes without saying.    is it immoral for a woman to wear nail polish?  For a married woman to show her face to another non-related man?  What is the punishment for a daughter that has pre-marital sex?    obviously your answer depends on what country, what gender, and what era u are born into.|`|CVqj8J4taa	I'm seeing too many answers that are confusing laws, customs, and traditions with morality.  Just because a society has decided that, lets say, killing every other newborn is morally acceptable to that society doesn't make it moral.  You'll find that even though all cultures have different laws, there are always laws of overlapping consensus such as murder, theft, etc.  These individual or societal moralities (or what can be comparable to a particular will) overlap, as philosophers like Rousseau or Kant would point out, at what would be a consensus of morality (or what can be comparable to a universal will).  This overlap is what is probably the closest we can get to KNOWING what is moral.|`|MRyfnMg4aa	Formally defined in the philosophy literature, moral relativists believe that morals are defined by unique sets of beliefs governed either by a society or oneself.  A moral relativist could believe that all of the norms of his/her culture are right whereas those of another culture are right for that other culture    Moral subjectivists believe that the basis for morality depends on certain beliefs that may be held by a range of beings.  Because of this looser definition, moral subjectivism would be inclusive of views held by moral relativists, but there are also more universal forms of subjectivism which are embodied in divine command theory of the ideal observer theory.      That may not answer your question, but there is a distinction between the two terms you used.|`|TSkI7Nktaa	Morality must  be subjective becasue the vast of majority of our laws are based on morals, the only thing is we pick and choose which morals we like and which we dont as opposed to accepting morals for what they are

o4iqmay8aa	Yes. I think the sane fans of 'Twilight' need a little more fair representation. I hate the fact that I'm judged for having enjoyed the series. It's not like we don't read other books as well. I have 'Twilight' sitting between 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Les Miserables' on my bookshelf.   (Sorry for the rant)|`|UMPlbaDGaa	I might depending on which book it's talking about. I have read Twilight and part of New Moon but I haven't read the others.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	No , but I find myself answering it anyway Twilight's fans made it really overrated.|`|fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	Okay WELL go to a fansite instead of a place to ask questions. I mean all you obsessed fans KNOW all the answers to these questions so why not just go to a fansite and "Squeeeee!" about it there? This is a pointless question. You all ask pointless, already-asked questions.    It's getting old. Actually it IS old. Stop.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	I know. Its also one of the reason's half the decent users of Yahoo dislike you.|`|dHjjLozcaa	Yes I would. The Books & Authors section has become my favorite category in Y!A, because I seriously love answering Twilight questions.|`|VYVI9H6Eaa	no lol but i know a lot about books because i love to read them|`|cxVmq2kraa	Nope.

JMN6CFwzaa	Is it called "Cocktails for Three"   By: Madeleine Wickham
d34420f9831ea7145b960db693b6179aaa	Marquis isn't a "surname" in French society of that day. It was his title. He could have faced the guillotine anytime from the outset of the French Revolution until the beginning of Napoleon's empire when it was acceptable to be a noble again. You'll have to search for religious records on Henry or a will in probate wherever he died to find out more about his birth and parentage. The records are there if you search through church, census and land records. I wouldn't search for them in history books, though. Warrants during the regime could be called out by any citizen making an accusation against any noble at any time. There didn't need to be written accusations to get someone to a guillotine. If he was a marquis and had enemies, you bet he fled to England on the first rowboat, barge, ship or floating log to be found.|`|l1pewZpaaa	It seems a bit unlikely. The French Revolution ended in 1799, and "The Terror"( the period of time when they sent 20,000+ people to the guillotine) was from 1793-1794    It was peaceful after Napoleon because of The Congress of Vienna.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	The French Revolution lasted from about 1789 to 1801, depending upon your sources. Methinks it's still going on today.    I would not bother to answer your question, but I have about 15 family lore stories, like this, and have proved 13 of them with documentation.  Like you, the story is that a Marquis De Le Granae (nobody knows how to spell it) escaped to Ireland (it's a Catholic thing). The lore is that he was a very nice guy to the peasants, and they generally liked him, but things got out-of-hand and he had to leave.    I would like to know more about this subject too: but methinks a lot of records were destroyed in that fiasco, and methinks that I'm stuck with a brick wall and family lore on that line of my ancestry. Email me if you find anything...our family stories are too similar. I have yet to find documentation to prove the family lore: but hey, any whispered rumor that travels though 200 years should be investigated. Happy hunting.
EMPVvJcDaa	Here are my Favorite books! They all have to do with vampires or ghosts!    A Certain Slant of Light ( Ghost and mortal fall in love, there is a twist)  by Laura Whitcomb    The Blood Coven Series: Twin sisters one of which is goth and wants to become a vampire, however the wrong twin is bit and the other twin becomes a vampire hunter)    Boys that Bite  Girls that Growl  Stake That  All by Mari Mancusi    Colby Blanchard Series: (Girl is attacted and turned into a vampire, Problem being she has had her fangs pulled and losses all her popularity)    Braced 2 Bite  Fangs 4 Freaks  Dating 4 Demons  All by Serena Robar     House of Night series:  Marked   Betrayed  Chosen  All by P. C. Cast (Author), Kristin Cast (Author)    Recommended Author:  Charlaine Harris    These are all great books for young women to read. They all have to do with vampires except for A Certain Slant of Light. It deals with a Ghost who falls in ove with a human. You may also check out the large Selection of books written by Charlaine Harris. She is the author responsible for the Tru blood series on HBO. If you are unfamiliar with this series then I will tell you this. It is about a waitress named sookie who can read minds. A vampire moves to town and they fall in love. She is a mortal kind of like Bella!|`|foCWBdpuaa	Stephenie meyer's twilight series are excellent.     They are about a teen who falls in love with a dreamy vampire.     Wonderful books. I definitely recommend.|`|sajJeZvgaa	I Hate The World By Gabriel Krudo|`|KQjBLyU3aa	How about Vampire Kisses.... or Sweetblood. Don't read Twilight if you're looking for Goth books, it's a pretty good series in my opinion but their interpretation of vampires isnt really goth...

I just feel like it's kind of off beat in some places. But I'm not really a poet.    Like, where it says,  Can't find anything,  but I can only keep trying.    I'd get rid of only. I just think it makes it flow better. But, it's your poem, so really, you should do with it what you want.|`|tC02KPckaa	I does sound like you are kind of depressed, but it is really good. People probably think like that all the time when they breakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend.

vivSJnOgaa	Hitchhiker's  Guide is probably the easiest and most entertaining to read.     The Color Purple is okay.  Better than the movie.      Clockwork Orange is fabulous, but violent.  It inspired me to study Russian in college!    One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is very good.  The movie is good, too.     Fahrenheit 451 (not 452) is a good book.  Because of it, I went on to read a lot more Ray Bradbury in and after high school.     I know I read Handmaid's Tale, but remember absolutely nothing about it.      I have not read Brave New World or The Wars.|`|wmKb8LeCaa	The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a fantastic read! It had me laughing like crazy! Fahrenheit 451 and the Color Purple are also great works. I think you should read a summary online of these books and figure out which one YOU would like to read the most. Good luck!|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	i read the handmaids tale for a class project    its ok, parts of it are very good (there are some parts that are a bit gross, or at least i found them kinda gross at the time)  its very emotional, u really feel for the protagonist and all she has lost.|`|AA11334468	Brave New World    Grapes of Wrath is also very good|`|EvLS2pRjaa	Yes i have read the book color purple. its an incredible book. I would recommend it to every body who likes to read|`|XCjzc6nMaa	I've read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and I would definitely recommend it. But i also heave heard that The Color Purple and Brave New World are great books and have a lot to write about if you are writing an essay|`|t2LOcPkLaa	Brave New World is a very good book and quite similar to 1984. Everyone I know that's read it had really enjoyed it--I don't know what that stupid person up there was talking about. I've heard Farenheit 451 is also really good, it's currently on my to-read list. I've seen the movies based on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Girl, Interrupted is similar and also has a book based on it) and The Clockwork Orange (it's CRAZY, i'm not sure if you'd like it).|`|q1ui0cS0aa	Lord of the flies|`|VN8kBnuRaa	I heard that Fahrenheit 452 is really good.|`|AA12375660	I HATED Brave New World. It was just weird and boring. I don't recommend that one.  Fahrenheit 451 was a good book with a good theme [about reading books!] I read it in 10th grade and it was good.   I have not read Hitchhiker's Guide, but I know a lot of people that enjoyed that one.|`|EiyCwOGOaa	i have read none but my brother read most at school|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Oh man I'd go with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because it's a lot of fun to read. I tried to read Fahrenheit 451 so many times as a youth and I never got through it. I finally finished it in college. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is supposed to be good and the movie was really great but I've never read it.   If you want to go with one not on the list you could go with Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut   but I'd still go with the Guide. It's awesome.|`|V4fEgYIQaa	I've read Fahrenheit 451, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a Clockwork Orange, and the Color Purple. All are good books, in my opinion. A Clockwork Orange is a difficult read, because most of it is in a sort of Russian slang, so I probably wouldn't do that one... If you're doing a theme dystopia I think Fahrenheit 451 and a Clockwork Orange would be your best choices, though I'd go with Fahrenheit 451 because of the difficulty of a Clockwork Orange.|`|7APv8E6Taa	They are all very good. My favorite choices:  -Fahrenheit 451 (The temperature paper burns. About a firefighter who decides he does not want to burn books anymore. Makes you realize the statemnet "Stop and smell the roses.")  -A Handmaid's Tale (A society where fertile woman just become brood mares and are not allowed love.)    You can also read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and Time Machine by H G Wells, The Plot Against America by Philip Roth.|`|FAUPZeSxaa	I read Farenheit 451 but not Farenheit 452    I would totally recommend Farenheit 451.  It is really and I mean really creepy and not like scary but it is still really good.|`|A46UYUNNaa	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or The Colour Purple|`|wN1oY7IRaa	I've read A Clockwork Orange and The Color Purple, and would recommend either.  Both are very different.  If you don't mind violence, read Orange.|`|0tRYQDtMaa	Harry Potter/ Fablehaven/ Eragon|`|zBm2CWljaa	I have read The Handmaid's Tale and Fahrenheit 451. They are both really good and fairly easy reads. I would definitely recommend those two. Good Luck!|`|twScfpWUaa	I would HIGHLY recommend that you read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. If you don't understand it, you can always watch the Academy Award winning movie from 1975. Both are amazing
LVZdzPmpaa	It is a true story in that it is based on a real person and real events. Keep in mind, however, that the author had to extrapolate a great deal, not only about the mindset of the McCandless, but about the details of exactly what happened once he disappeared into the woods. McCandless had no contact with anyone so the details of his last days are unknown. Krakauer had to write about those bits as best he could based on the accounts of others.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	If it's about the young guy that gives away all his money and ends up dying in Alaska, then, yes, true.

SjTAVdcKaa	To gang up on the Soviet Union.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	For its first few years, NATO was not much more than a political association. However, the Korean War galvanized the member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, famously stated the organization's goal was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down".[4] Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion - doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure from 1966.
BFXKd5sCaa	Yes, absolutely go for both. I am a real fan of B&W because it allows you to feature textures and contrast. It shows your versatility|`|g8kIjpwSaa	I recommend putting in both. It will show your versatility.|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	Photographers work in both color and black and white, so showing you have shots in both simply shows your abilities in either format. Photography in either format is about lighting and composition, so this won't change and you either show talent in these areas or you don't. Black and white gives an emphasis to contrast and can show you are able to express yourself in this area as well. With color you can call attention to a subject by making use of the colors, with black and white you don't have this advantage, so other methods of making your subject stand out come in to play, and at a higher importance. Composition, lighting, contrast. dodging, burning, all come in to play on how you convey whatever it is you are trying to convey in your image. How do you emphasize someones eyes if you can't show their eye color? It's tricky, but shows one of the challenges of using B&W as a medium.    Oh, right, you asked a question....yes.|`|59429d3d1859d61851cb1c978737cff3aa	yes, of course, as long as they aren't part of the same series.  that's the way you show your talent!  Good luck!

When you start, just start doing scissors with your feet. Be careful not to bend your leg and push just your back leg, in fact you should focus on getting your front leg up high. Then as you practice more, get more plie so you have time to make the switch!

Jwk7Ib2vaa	Basically, the verb nullify means to make something void. Typically, you'll hear the phrase "null and void" referring to something, a warranty for example, that no longer holds any value or doesn't carry any weight. Hope this helps :)|`|zThIaO0Qaa	to nullify means to basically ignore something like it doesnt apply to you  calhoun is associatd with this because he nullified andrew jacksons law that army men could be stationed in SC to take taxes if necessary.

9XLUSMndaa	Nowadays imperialism is considered an insult.  However real imperialism means having to do with empire.  And empires started dismantling after World War I and had disappeared by the early 1960s.  So I would say they were a necessary stage to go through or at least they seemed like a good idea at the time and the world would be unimaginably different if they had never happened.
g8kIjpwSaa	The National average according to a December 2008 survey was $49,595 a year. It increased 4.4% from 2006.|`|ef5765ccb36f7ad11f5b37081f153824aa	That's a REALLY broad question. It all depends on experience, location, ability, freelance or for a business, how fast you are, etc. Most careers can give you a a ballpark of what you'll make in the field, but for a web designer, it's a very wide scope that could range anywhere from $15,000 a year to $100,000 a year. If you go freelance and have a LOT of business contacts and are good at what you do, you could make really good money. However, if you think it's just a walk in the park where you can kinda slack off working up half-@$$ed sites, you won't make more than $20,000 a year. If you get a job at a company that creates websites, you could make anywhere from $25k to $85k, depending on your demographics and experience and/or talent. As far as breaking it down per month.......I think it shouldn't be hard to do the math.    If you really want to do it, go to school for it, do some websites in your free time that look GOOD, and make sure you're very personable, as people want to be able to work one on one with you and enjoy it. Good luck. And remember......motivation=creation.
fakoqZwiaa	Acting, or even online role playing, I find to be very useful for writing stories well. I find it really helps if you understand what your characters feel, ALL of them, not just the ones that act like you do, and acting really helps you stay in character.    I think characters that go out of character are the ruin of a book, so I think acting can really help you fit into the shoes of all your characters. When you understand what your characters are feeling, it's easier to write it down.|`|daFmqiIIaa	You don't have to necessarily be a good actor, but you do have to know your characters well enough to be able to understand how they would think and react to situations.|`|90cyv9f0aa	Yes...  but I think it is more important to continually develop your imagination!!!|`|9Duha1k4aa	Well, yes. Acting involves expressing your emotion, so does writing. It has the same principle as being a doctor/being a scientist. They just go together.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	no.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	No. I see nothing in acting that could benefit your writing, except for maybe opening yourself a little, you know, imagination wise.|`|It3m1WpAaa	Yes, sure!  It would help your imagination and you could also descripe and 'really get into' your characters!  If your a good actor (or vis-versa) that doesn't mean your going to be a good writer.  You have to have skill in both fields.    Hope I helped!!
SPQdFOwKaa	Honestly, no. Where else might you stumble upon such an original and deep concept as the one of being born old and die without knowing anything in the arms of someone who loves us? No. There's no book like Benjamin Button. But you can read two other truly stunning literary masterpieces by F. Scott Fitzgerald: "The Great Gatsby" and "The last Tycoon."|`|7585zXZIaa	Turnabout is a story about two old women getting a sugery when they are old and it makes them age backwards. They are getting younger and younger and get to their teens and are both terrifies and excited for death. They get a second life and it is a really compelling story. Idk what you mean by the hats though|`|9iloCq9Oaa	A book called the Somnambulist features a character like Ben Button, but the character is not a main one.  It is of a mystery/fantasy nature, but some of the language is inappropriate, but I still recommend it...

vmmMqhxXaa	No.  Historical fiction portrays real historical events that affect the plot and the characters.  The key words are "real" and "affect."  If actual events don't influence the characters' lives, then it's just fiction that happens to be set in another time.    Two of my favorite historical novels:  "Master and Commander," by Patrick O'Brian  "Mr. Midshipman Hornblower," by C.S. Forester    Both are set during the Napoleonic Wars, and each is the first book in a very good series.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No - they are all about fictional people and events. Historical fiction is generally fiction written about history, not just fiction written a while ago.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Yea none of those books are  two are classics  and I don't know what the other two are|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Historical fiction creates a story with a factual account of historic details as a foundation for the story.    None of the titles you give are historical fiction per that definition. Each of the books is set in a specific time and the books are accurate as to the details of the setting, but none is set around a historical event.    Books like "Killer Angels" by Michael Shaara are set fully in the Civil War and include many details about battles, military officers, etc. and are consider "historical fiction" in the truest sense. Historical fiction brings real, historical facts into play, often to the point where it is difficult to tell where the facts stop and the fiction starts.    This is not to say that you can't learn something about the period in which Dickens was writing. Jules Verne's book is more adventure than anything else. "Black Beauty" is set in 19th century England but is not set against historical events.
AA11236094	Yes, they have the same final vowel sound, and the same number of syllables, 4, all stressed on the 3rd syllable.    Pronunciation is:    pah-key-stAh-nee  kah-wah-sAh-kee    This rhyme would be considered a 'feminine, oblique' rhyme.    a feminine rhyme has the stress on the next to last syllable of the words, like maybe-baby.  An oblique rhyme has different final consonants or unmatched ending sounds, like line-rhyme.     But yes, these do rhyme.|`|SIFwDinAaa	um not really...you pronounce the i's differently|`|UPN3zqq6aa	yer lol|`|cf217a7ce3f072b96b3827b9fa9b820faa	in a wierd way kinda|`|RvddYKqjaa	No, I don't think they rhyme, but in some poems they would work since they both end in "i."

amcqJkWhaa	Well, any drawing you do is good for you,  since with more practice you are more likely to remember techniques and stuff.     I think you'll draw clean lines once you become more confident in drawing, have more belief in your ability, or perhaps, relax a bit more. Lines are like direction arrows-- so you could look at it like, having one line is having one powerful direction, and having broken or  hair lines would be more like, going in different directions... So, it's okay. You'll have different lines for your different moods, and also for your different projects, because with me, I don't really know what to do  most of the time, so my lines can get really messy and scratchy... well it's called a sketch (but 'sketch' is to be better defined).   Like, I draw side views of faces a lot, and also eyes, so I'm more familiar drawing them, and so, those come out as one line thingies usually-- but that's because it's simple subject.     You can wear a glove. I haven't tried it out though. Also you can put a piece of paper, or a tissue maybe, under your hand. I heard napkin wrappers work.|`|bLGvLY7caa	Well, the trick I used airbrushing is called a bridge. Just a rectangular piece of 1/4 inch plexiglass (you can get it at a hardware store) about 8 inches long and 3 inches high - this is the bridge part.     Then you just cut a couple additional 1x3 inches of plex, and glue them onto the each end of the "bridge" with caulk to lift it off of the surface of your work. You can move it all over the surface of your work with no smudging.     It also does double duty as a straight edge when drawing. (or spraying in my case although it also works great when doing detail brush work)    It easy to move around and doesn't get in the way of your work. Excellent for working with pastels too.|`|ianulrAJaa	Using a bridge only prevents you from smearing, it will not TRAIN you to draw cleaner.      Confidence will create a cleaner drawing.    I would make many, many blind (never look until you finish) and semi-blind (ocationally look) contour drawings to start.    Learn to draw with an easel instead of a table.    Draw with you entire arm instead of your fingers.    Put on some soothing music, and don't drink coffee (it makes you jumpy).    Softly establish the "envelope" of your drawing by soflty sketching the general proportions of your entire drawing and then draw more heavily the details making the fewest stokes possible.  Think of drawing general "shapes" instead of "lines", which is another way of saying draw from big-to-small details and not small-to-big.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Because I draw with ballpoint pen about half the time and if I get skin oil on the paper it doesn't draw well along with pencil smearing, I have a couple of thin white PVC sheets that I keep with my drawing pad.  One is about the size of a business letter and I can stuff it in a shirt pocket if need be and rest the heel of my hand on it while the other is about half the size of the drawing pad page so I have more freedom to move my hand.    "rather than leaving the pencil down"  You don't want to leave the pencil down, just as you don't want to diddle around with small strokes.  You should be drawing just the line you want - the curve of the cheek bone, the edge of the upper right lip - in one stroke and lifting off, then drawing the next portion perhaps adjusting your paper and hand so you get the easy sweep and start just at the previous line.    Way back in college (see my gray hair), in an almost incidental drawing class in engineering on getting your ideas down on paper the best releasing information was to move the paper so you could make straight or curved lines across, not trying to wiggle the cramped hand up to draw with the paper always in the same position.    And you might try using harder pencils.|`|k7PVEyGYaa	You can draw a sketchy version and then trace it onto a clean sheet of paper. For shading try making your lines in different colors, then get a small piece of paper and rub it across for blending.

GLS7vgAdaa	I think the first question you have to ask yourself is "Why is he not willing to compromise at all?" You're heading toward marriage and compromise is essential in so much that you'll do together and it should start now. I have to give you kudos for suggesting one. Do you know when he gets off work? Maybe take your shoes off till it's almost time for him to come home. You deserve your comfort, too. Or see if you can work out a deal where 4 days out of the week you'll leave your shoes on for him and the other 3 are for you to do what makes you happy.   My personal belief is that if you just give in to him, months or years down the line you might get so tired of this that you start to regret your initial decision and even start to resent him for it. Please remember that you teach others how to treat you. If you don't come up with some kind of compromise in the long run all you're doing is giving up a small but possibly important comfort for you. That's just as important as giving him this small happiness. And no, it's definitely not selfish. I'm sure you work hard and you deserve to kick off your shoes and stretch out on the couch after a long day. Best of luck with your endeavors, whatever you decide.|`|44ujDxwqaa	relationship/marriage..or love is a two-way street. if you are only giving out and not taking in, what would happen to you? i guess it is okay to do this session once in awhile, but it is frequent, or everyday at that, then it is not normal. you need to tell him it is not making you comfortable.|`|sZopcfQWaa	If you get home hours before him take your shoes off and put them back on when you see him pull in the driveway, when you get home the same time go to the bathroom or bedroom and take your shoes off to give your feet a breather.

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Maybe you had better research the history of the "middle class" a bit more.  I think you will find that what we think of the Middle Class did not exist.  The lower classes had working clothing.  The merchants mostly had to work in their clothing also, so anything too fancy would be ruined.  Anyone who had the capability of dressing up would look up to the upper class to copy some portion of what they wore.  Only the upper class had the freedom from hand labor and control of their environment enough to tart up their costumes and follow fashion.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Because the "middle classes" were made up of such a wide variety of people, the costume of the middle class was similarly varied. More humble women of the middle class might wear an outfit much like her peasant counterpart,     Chemise or Partlet:  Depending upon a woman's social status and attire, a woman might wear either a chemise, which like that of the other classes was a loose shirt of varying length, or a partlet, which is comparable to the modern "dickie", and looked like a chemise but was really just a neckpiece that tucked into the top of the bodice. Both the chemise and the partlet were gathered into a collar around the neck, often with a little ruffle. A noblewoman's chemise or partlet would have been made of very fine fabric, sometimes silk or linen, or another fabric that complimented her gown, though as always modern reenactors could choose any non-printed natural fiber fabric that could pass casual inspection. Blackwork embroidery could be added to the edges to further embellish it.     Bodice    An Elizabethan noblewoman's bodice was tightly fitted to her torso to accentuate the Elizabethan style bodice is worn over the chemise, like a vest, but it laces up. Though middle class women's bodices all basicly follow the same lines, there are many variations on the general theme: some laced up the front, like the peasant version, while more well to do women who could afford a servant might have a bodice that laced up the back. Small cap or puff sleeves at the shoulders could be worn, as could "tippets" (little tabs of fabric sewn into the waist cut in various shapes). Middle class women could also afford a wider range of fabrics than a peasant could have. Fine wool, heavy linen, flannel, cotton chamois cloth and fine whaled corduroy can all be appropriate choices for a more modest middle class woman's bodice, while wealthy merchant's wives would have had clothing almost as fine as a noblewoman, and could even use brocades, velvets and tapestries. You will either want the bodice to be boned for support, much like a corset, so that it holds your body into the Elizabethan shape, or to wear a period-styled corset underneath it. Boning in bodices should be heavier than the flimsy plastic type that you find in women's lingerie, and a suitable type will probably not be available in your local fabric store, so if you choose to sew your own you may be interested in the websites listed in the sewing section which sell heavy corset boning. Since the bodice is by far the most difficult item of peasant clothing to construct, you may simply want to purchase a pre-made one and save yourself the work. If you wear an unboned bodice over a corset, make sure that the corset is of an Elizabethan style, rather than the Victorian style which is far more common today. The main difference between the two is that a Victorian corset cups the breasts and thrusts them outward, whereas an Elizabethan corset saught to flatten a woman's torso and tended to push a woman's breasts strait up. The overall line of your clothing will be ruined if you are not wearing the appropriate corset.     Sleeves    A middle class woman would be likely to wear sleeves, which would be tied (or even possibly sewn) on to the shoulders of her bodice. There is probably more variation with sleeves than in any other area of Elizabethan costuming. A few poplular styles of the era were the leg of mutton sleeve, which was a padded sleeve that was very full on the upper arm and tapered to the wrist, and the hanging sleeve, which was really two sleeves, one of them left unbuttoned and open to hang over a narrower undersleeve. Browse the offerings of different merchants, patterns and portraits of the period for ideas. There are links to all of the above throughout the website and in the links section. A woman's sleeves would probably be made out of the same fabric as her bodice, or in certain instances her underskirt.     Skirts    At least two skirts would probably have been worn by a middle class woman. Lower middle class women might have worn the same gored or circle skirts as her peasant counterpart, only in better quality linen, wool, or any solid color natural fiber fabric that approximates the look of one of those, including cotton broadcloth, lawn, chamois cloth, or flannel. An upper middle class woman would have worn a overskirt (probably of the same material as her bodice and sleeves), like a noblewoman, usually split up the front to reveal the often elaborate forepart of her underskirt. Upper middle class women could have gowns made of heavy silk, velvet, damask or brocade in addition to the more common wools and linens. Most middle class women would have worn something to add fullness to her skirts. Lower middle class women might have simply worn a petticoat, while social climbing upper middle class women would have worn the same farthingale (hoopskirt) that a noblewoman wore.     Cloaks    A cloak can also be worn, if you wish, though it

AA11651312	Hey! I just wanna point out that if you have trouble understanding his sonnets you should get the No Fear Shakespeare Sonnet book by Sparknotes. It translates each sonnet to everyday terms that anyone can understand. I should know because I'm taking an intro to shakespeare class right now, and we're covering sonnets. i thought it'd be terrible, and annoying to understand but sparknotes makes it easy :)     so anyways, my favorite sonnet is probably   130. the reason why its my favorite is because he kinda mocks cheesy poets that make cliche similes/comparisons about their lovers. such as "her eyes are like the sun".  he is basically saying in the sonnet that even though his lover's eyes are not like the sun, and her cheeks aren't rosy, he still loves her.  and she's more special than any other false comparison that a poet could come up with. i like this sonnet cause there's something about his writing here that seems genuine, and realistic. like, he's not saying she's perfect. he's admitting she has flaws unlike the other poets.     anyways, i'm guessing your in an acting class? for memorizing purposes, i'd probably recommend reciting sonnet 18 though because it's famous, and you'd probably would pick it up faster cause once you read it, it might be familiar to you. it's the one where he compares his lover to a summer day...yadda yadda lol. remember with a lot of his sonnets, the major theme is - beauty is timeless/everlasting. and it's good to have children, because it keeps your beauty alive longer (when you die, people can tell you were beautiful b/c you have a kid alive to prove it).     i wish you the best of luck!!! you'll do great|`|gZ0NPuleaa	CXLVII    1.

Almost everyone selling stuff was making it and was a journeyman or master in the guild system or a "servant" in a household like the horse master, seamstress, etc. You didn't wander down to a shop and look through a selection of prepared goods, you discussed materials and perhaps looked at samples or sample drawings and it was made for you.

tiKEy7uraa	In character they were both brave, determined, outspoken, just and passionate women. They were very alike although Charlotte used to deny that because according to Lucasta Miller (The Bronte myth, 2006) and Lyndall Gordon (Charlotte Bronte: a passionate life, 1995) she wanted to dissociate herself from the accusation of coarseness attributed to Jane Eyre and so she chose to present to her contemporaries a very sober, fragile, ultra womanly kind of image to protect herself and fame. Gaskell with her biography came to finish the job presenting her as a perfect domesticated woman who had an unfortunate life, but her works and letters show a fiery character and a brave, strong woman.  They had also the same external appearance. Charlotte Bronte told Emily and Anne that it was wrong (even morally wrong) to portray their heroines always beautiful, but they objected that no one would ever care for them, if they weren't pretty. Charlotte told them that she was going to create a heroine as plain and small (4,9 feet was her height) as she herself was, that nevertheless she would be much more interesting than any of their heroines. They also both chose a simple but elegant way of dressing, usually with dark colors. Charlotte too felt badly for not being beautiful and she frequently chose the most dark lighted corner of a room when in company but when alone she preferred sitting on the window sill.   They shared the same hobby, painting which was the first career Charlotte Bronte wanted to follow but her deteriorating sight made her give it up. Jane's bad dreams about children was also Charlotte's nightmare.   About depressive viewpoints I believe she mostly gave that to Lucy Snowe. For me Jane isn't depressed but tries like Charlotte not to have too high expectations, something some people tend to think as both wise and realistic.

However, my digital video camera has a way, while I shoot or play back, I can hit a shutter button and frame grab to my memory stick. Can you play-back thru the camera and "take pictures" as you watch..?    You may have to acquire a program and one good one is from Pinnacle. They have a series of video editing programs called Studio and they go from less than 9 to above 12 now. All of them have a frame grab feature and you may find a older prg at a used software store for a fraction of it's original cost.    Windows has a video editing program called Movie Maker. It is part of the OS. It may be able to help you if your using XP or Vista.    Good luck    Bob - Tucson|`|uurgL3oZaa	Ever heard of the "print screen" button?

bC9bwpBhaa	George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall was a very interesting and somewhat corrupt character. He held many different offices at the same time and was a senator of New York.    What makes him interesting is his stance on honest and dishonest graft. He was in charge of a committee that would build certain things within the city, such as parks etc. He helped decide what would be built and knew what land it would be built on before the news went public. Then he would buy that land at a very low price, because the sellers thought it was useless, then when the companies tried to buy the land he sold it for a massive profit.    He said, "I seen my opportunities and I took em." He thought he was being perfectly fair and that was just a bonus from the job. However, buying this land at a much higher price caused the construction to cost more. Who spends the money on building state projects? The taxpayers do. So he wasn't just helping himself, but also secretly hurting the taxpayers.     He was a millionare and very set in his ways. He felt that education was unimportant within politics. He felt politics was only based on following and that it was a game that you must learn how to play, not learn about the migration of birds. He would go buy people out of jail to get their votes, he would go to Italian families funerals to get their votes, and feed people who had just had their houses burned. He did everything for a vote and for himself.     He was a very interesting man and your professor should look highly upon you for picking something fairly complicated and not well known. Give him a quick look and if you decide not to do him no problem. If so then you will learn a lot about the politics of the late 1800s.|`|qrD6OqcPaa	These is a huge variety of topics you could potentially write on. For example, last semester I wrote my final history paper about bootlegging prosecution in two Minnesota counties, and used local court documents from the time to research. That is probably a little more hardcore than what you're looking for.    I don't know what time period you are studying, so I will try to throw out a few suggestions from some different eras.    -Thomas Jefferson/Sally Hemmings controversy  -Depending on what state you're in, perhaps your state/community's contributions to any war in American history.  -Andersonville, the Civil War prison that housed Northern soldiers during the war. Many books have been written about this.  -Health practices during any time period -- if you want wartime, perhaps health on the battlefield would be good. Other good topics include midwifery, mental health, and social welfare-type programs.  -James J. Hill (or any other corporate tycoon). They are always pretty interesting.    I hope these are of some help to you. Good luck choosing a topic!|`|sNBilcN8aa	did you ever think about writing about the civil war that took place in the state of New Mexico.great and interesting reading, also the battle in North new mexico.

XD7koB5faa	The first question you should address is in your first line: digital or film.  I am a digital convert after 35 years of film photography, and I'd suggest going digital.  This is not because I think that digital is necessarily better than film - there are strong advocates on both sides of the film/digital divide, and correctly so. Instead, my recommendation is because I think digital, if used properly, can accelerate the learning process.      What works for you is the fast feedback obtained by being able to look at the pictures on the computer as soon as you get home (instead of waiting for photo processing, or processing them by yourself).      There are some things that work against you with digital that you should be aware of.  It is easy to take hundreds of pictures without too much thought, as compared to film which is relatively expensive and therefore forces you to think carefully about each shot you take.  You also miss out on the chance to process your own film, which provides a great learning exercise about light and exposure.    After your digital/film decision comes the decision about DSLR or non-DSLR. If you are going to invest in more serious camera gear, then you want to make sure that you will be committed to taking advantage of it.    There are a few questions that you should ask yourself in order to make the decision:    When you look at your photographs, do you look to see things you'd like to improve?    Then, do you see things in your pictures that you could improve upon if you were able to have more control over shutter speed, light, and focus?    Do you want to be able to shoot in lower light conditions without a flash?    Do you want the sharpest possible images, especially at long focal lengths?    Do you want to be able to use a variety of lenses?    Are you willing to spend the time to learn how to take advantage of the features?    If this sounds like what you would like to get out of a camera, then a DSLR may be right for you. If it sounds like a lot of unrewarding work, or if the questions don't make sense to you yet, then you may not get the most out of your investment in DSLR gear.    It doesn't hurt to start small.  By making a small investment in a good point-and-shoot camera, you can learn what you like and don't like.  If you really like taking pictures, I am sure that you will want to upgrade whatever equipment you own at some point, no matter what you start with - I haven't met a serious amateur photographer who hasn't upgraded.    As for brand, I started with Kodak Ektagraphic, moved to Pentax, then to Nikon.  Those were all film.  I moved to Minolta and Fuji when I went digital, and now own Nikon again.  Every one of those cameras, and many other brands, took wonderful pictures.  My gravitation to Nikon is just a matter of personal preference, maybe a bit of brand loyalty, but not dogma.    I can tell you that you are about to embark upon a fun journey in photography.    Cheers,    Ted  http://improve-your-digital-photography....|`|ianulrAJaa	There is no right answer.  It depends on what kind of photography you want to do.    The newest simple snapshot cameras are amazing, have tons of features, take great pictures, but do most of everything automaticaly.    Professional Digital SLR cameras have even more options but will not do as much automatically.  This foces you to learn to take pictures without the automatic features, and allows you greater creative freedom.    I used to be  die-hard fan of film cameras over digital, but ever since I bought my Canon EOS, I realized that the new technology is superior to film.    All my film cameras are obsolete, I can't find replacement parts, and it is expensive to repair, develop, etc.    With digital, I can see the results instantly, and decide if I have to take the pictures again.    For beginners, any brand is great (Nikon, Sony, Cannon, etc.)  Avoid buying the latest, because they lose value quickly as newer and better models are available every six months.  Last year's cameras work almost as well as this year's.    Once you are a pro, then go spend thousands on the latest technology.    My suggestion is to buy a DSLR (like Canon EOS) and a "for dummies" or "for idiots" book for the model of your camera (they are GREAT books) to learn all the features of your camera.    If you really want to learn photography, I would not but a snapshot.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Nikon D40 DSLR is good.Easy to use.Nice out of the camera result picture quality.Affordable price.Compact size and light weight   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ...|`|GGqh73iWaa	Nikon and Canon hold nearly 90% of the market.

You can't go wrong. One convenient feature that is exclusive to Nikon is that all Nikon manual lenses can be used with the digital bodies.  Over the past 8 to 10 years Canon has been embraced strongly by photo journalists and sports photographers. Only certain manual lenses will work on the digital bodies.  Both are quality systems but, in my opinion Nikon builds a sturdier camera.  If you want top shelf quality and you have the money, I would go with Leica.  As for which model, I would do some research, ask the folks at the camera stores and get something that you can grow into and expand on. You're better off spending a little more money on something that you won't have to replace just because you've out grown it's features.

You are also missing some necessary commas.    Read your story out loud to yourself.  Where you would pause naturally, there should be a comma.  Where you would stop, there should be a period.    For example:  "My name is Leah and I was 7 years old when this started it started with me feeling terribly ill and then my life started changing , forever."

QEEweJUaaa	Between 1890 and the First World War, the womans movement was extremely active and vigorous. By 1914, the womens movement was focused on women suffrage. The womens movement suffered numerous set backs though. The National American Women Suffrage Association or NAWSA had abandoned the congressional campaign and concentrated on the states. By 1910, only four states had equal women suffrage. These failures were partly due to opposing organizations of anti-suffragists, who believe that politics was no place for women. It was not over yet!     With new leaders, including a woman called Alice Paul, the NAWSA brought all new tactics and ideas into their campaign. Paul was not used to and also not happy with her small role though. She started her own organization called the Congressional Union in Washington DC. Although NAWSA and the Congressional Union used similar tactics such as parades, rallies and protests, the NAWSA focused on the state legislatures and the Congressional Union concentrated on Congress. Later on, the Congressional Union broadened it focus to state level and even made itself into a political party, called the Womans Party. Despite their differences, NASWA and the Congressional Union worked well together. When tension mounted and Congress repeatedly rejected the Women Suffrage Amendment, Alice Paul and the Womans Party turned to extreme measures. In 1917, they organized round the clock picket lines in front of the White House. They were arrested and jailed and also received national press coverage when they were force-fed after refusing to eat. Eventually, Congress passed the amendment in 1919. The amendment was annexed and made official on August 18, 1920 when Tennessee approved, giving women the right to vote.     Unfortunately, the 1920s did not show such emphasis on womens issues. After the Womens Suffrage amendment was passed in 1920, womens organizations splintered and disagreed on valuable causes for the womens movement. Many veteran suffragists were worn out from the seemingly unending battle that took place just a decade before. They now felt that it was essential for them to return to the tasks they had pushed aside. Others felt women had reached liberation and equality, so there was nothing more for them to want.     This allowed anti-feminist undercurrents to rise up in society. The media was bombarded with the image of the happy housewife. Women were encouraged to take their place in the home again. In opposition to this image, the new generation of women took a whole new look. Rebellion against societys standards was prominent and a free morality was set in. Young women took an attitude of free and easy living, fun and freedom. These flaming youths or flappers as they were later called, wore short skirts, smoked cigarettes, danced wild, new dances, and in general, enjoyed themselves.     The Great Depression hit the U.S. hard in the 1930s. It also started a work war among women. With the failing economy, the first to be laid-off were the married working women, who were taking jobs away from men, despite the fact that men now had reduced salaries that couldnt support their families. Legislature in 26 states even had proposed bills that would prohibit the employment of married women. Women organizations took on a determined resistance against these and only one bill was passed, which was in Louisiana. Later on, it was ruled unconstitutional in the courts. Despite all the hostility, the number of employed women stayed basically the same as the 1920s. Women workers were still cheaper and certain fields of work were considered virtually closed to men. Men found themselves unemployed and often lost track of time, wandering the streets in disarray. Womens lives were less disrupted by the depression than their husbands. Because of this, women became the center of stability in the family. Another result of the depression was a decline of divorces and an increase of marriages. Divorce was simply too expensive and marriage was seen as emotional support for young, single women in a time of uncertainty. Concerned about jobs and housing, people lost interest in the rebellious young style of the 20s and also the new moral standards.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Wasn't it the MEN that were recieved by the women?|`|6pksPo7Zaa	You have to realise the Great Gatsby is a fictional work concerning a miniscule element in society.

If they have nothing to hide....why not give you contact info for people who they have worked with to tell you what its like?? Any place that has nothing to fear wouldn't mind you talking to people who have been through it and can tell you the real story behind it
v70p2kgWaa	Young adult books tend to be in that section for a reason.  Often the characters, themes, and reading comprehension are geared towards 7th graders and above .  If you are concerned that the content would not be appropriate for someone under that age group, always read it ahead of time.      Just because an teen or an adult reading a book says it's okay doesn't mean a parent will say the same thing.  "Vulgar" also has a different meaning to young ones (an example is anymore I look over border line cuss words like crap and s**t which to young ones, as well as this sites filter, is consider vulgar, so I can't remember if it appeared in Uglies or Peeps).    As far as ease of reading Westerfeld writes at about a 5th/6th grade level which is common for young adult authors.  Uglies is classified as appropriate for indepentant readers and middle grades 4-8th.  Peeps and Secret Hour however is a high school interest level (both of which I agree with because the books are darker and have some fighting in them)|`|fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	Nope! I read them aaat I think around 14 and they're perfectly safe. any bad words are basically the futuristic version of "crap!" so it's really fine.    Also there is no sex! Ever. There's a KISS in the first book buut it's not like a big deal. Not a lot of violence either, it's a great book!    I'd let my kid read it whenever she wanted|`|daza5A4vaa	Nope.  There's some futuristic slang, like the first answerer said, but it's nothing terrible.  They're great.
daza5A4vaa	I don't know how he sleeps at night.  If I had that kind of shxt going through my head all the time, I'd be a chronic insomniac.  "It" scared me so bad.  And the sink was leaking the night I read it. It was awful.    I'm a big fan (:|`|PQBEqS8Caa	all i can say is that I love his style. Som books are obviously better than others. My favs are CARRIE, The shining, Insomnia, etc|`|FLfmkNEAaa	IDK I like Dean Koontz a lot better because of his writing style.|`|AA12029875	Writes good books that make awful movies just so he can be in them.|`|H0LfFGmlaa	He's my favorite author. I read Duma Key, Cujo, Firestarter, Thinner, Dolores Claiborne, Christine, and am in the process of reading the Stand. He's amazing at developing the characters and then creating an interesting plot.|`|hdnI8ARiaa	very prolific|`|kLPaq30Eaa	I absolutely love Stephen King. I own almost every book he's ever written. He can write about the most versatile things and everything I've ever read of his was so well-written. He puts into words concepts and ideas and thoughts that most people have, but don't realize that we all share.|`|eMFwMQGHaa	Personally I don't like him. I think most of his books are brainless. I've never read it, but The Shawshank Redemption was a great movie and it was one of the best I've seen. I like Kurt Vonnegut.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Please, get a dictionary and ask this question using proper English if you expect to be taken seriously.    I think King is a brilliant writer in his own right because of how he changed the horror genre over the last 35+ years. However, I sometimes feel he is a little arrogant and behaves as though he is the only one capable of writing great novels. He is to be recognized and does deserve his success but the ego should be toned down some.|`|iT9S20zvaa	One thing I have always thought about Stephen King (and maybe no one else thinks this): I can't help but get the impression that he roots for the bad guys.  Who usually wins in the end or scores more points against the good guys?--that's right, the villains.  I find this very interesting and I think it might say something about him, though I'm not sure what.  That's pretty much it.  What do I think about Stephen King...well, sometimes...he likes it when the bad guys win (and if you don't believe me, read a few of his books).|`|0NQL7yRPaa	just an old white guy..hes good dough|`|dDPEnNMBaa	My view on Stephen King is that he is an amazingly gifted author who puts real fears into vivid pictures. I really love old Stephen King, but I now feel that he is relying on the name he made for himself through Carrie and The Shining and such and that his newer books are just bad copies of his old books and that it almost seems as though he is not even really trying any more. I always pick up new Stephen King books with my breath held and my finger crossed and they stay that way until I go blue in the face. I highly reccomend the old Stephen King books but I would stay away from the newest ones.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Very creative, VERY prolific.     His earlier stuff is better. The pieces he wrote when he was pumping out several books a year were not so good.     And I loved "On Writing"|`|vUBBIUXqaa	Stephen King puts all of our worst fears into words.|`|K4f9QQj4aa	who is he :)|`|xfj1B7YSaa	his writing is succinct! although he is not the best author out there. i consider him as mastermind in suspense.|`|xOh6IXWsaa	I like some of Stephen King's stuff, but not all of it. I think his best stories are the ones where he focuses on one character, really sucks you into their world and makes you care about them, that's what he's good at. Carrie and Apt Pupil (from Different Seasons) are my favourites.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	I like Stephen King's books and have read almost everyone.For me his first books were the best,like The Shinig,Carrie,It,Salem's Lot.His last books are somehow more commercialized and has lost some of there originality.I didn't like books like Misery,Dolores Claireborn,Lisey's story.He didn't only write horrors but have also tried his hand at writing fantasy.His Tower series are great.|`|6StMUFgkaa	King wrote a book on writing.  It is quite good.  In it he said he listens to Guns and Roses while he writes.  That explain a lot.  He also said he doesn't remember writing some of the books that have his name on them.  And so where was he while the book was being penned??  I agree that he seems to champion the villian like he knows it better than anyone else.  He changed a lot after he was hit by a car while taking a walk.  I haven't read any of his stuff since then so I don't know if it shows in his writing.    Some of his books will stay with you FOREVER...like Pet Cemetery or The Shining.      I'm curious, how come you can spell creativity, but not something?  You must be non-English speaking?|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Stephen King has a rock band with other authors the song I head was These boots are made for Walking sung by Amy Tan.  I haven't consumed much of Steven Kings work, yet but he is an inspiration for many newer authors like Scott Sigler.( since I have listened to all of Sigler's book I am listing to the Steven King books available my local library has)   Many of my favorite writers said the King's book On Writing is very good. ( I haven't taken the time to read it yet but now own a copy)   I have only hear one book criticized that was written by Stephen King.(no I don't remember which book)|`|395196f427a3bfd5aca87f8298bfa682aa	He's great. I really love his books.  The way he takes the fear out of your head and puts it onto paper or in a movie is almost scary.  Now there are parts when he looses me and I have to go back and reread but any author can do that.  Nobody I can think of even comes close to his writing style.  My favorites are Rose Red, Carrie, and Lisey's Story.  Someday I'd like to own all of his books in hard back lol.  I also like the fact that he just writes what he's thinking, there is no rewording it or rephrasing with him.  :)|`|lMT8btn8aa	I think that he is a very good author. He has a wide spectrum of topics and generally, his books have been better than the movies made off of them.

Dt06gcbIaa	Karma is not a figment of the imagination, but it is not perfect, and it is not quite as moral as one might think.    If you treat others badly, it will become harder and harder to keep friends.  If you drive inconsiderately, it is more likely you will be the cause of an accident, and hence more likely to be in one.  If you manage money inappropriately, it is more likely you will have less money to mismanage.    Who has a great - but poor - friend, who despite their good nature cannot manage money?    How many parents lose good kids, just because they were young (and perhaps understandably) reckless behind the wheel?    Do you know any rich arseholes?  (Karma still gets them - they may be excellent money managers - but they're arseholes, and hence don't have any REAL friends.)    Sometimes poverty afflicts the intelligent money-manager.  Sometimes friendlessness afflicts the shy instead of the mean.  Sometimes car accidents take an innocent bystander, instead of the culpable driver.    Hence my comment that karma ain't smart or moral.  Perhaps karma is a rather pretty name for probability?|`|ICgD4uCaaa	i believe all that happens in our lives is of our own imagination!!!! We are What We Think! If we BELIEVE it will happen to us, IT DOES!!! This is why we need NOT believe what miserable, down in the mouth, pessimist tell us to think..............Always use mind and heart or your ownimagination.  There is a book "why bad things happen to good people.' MAYBE YOU CAN FIND IT ONLINE?|`|d0bJBzo6aa	I'm not sure karma really exists, but if we don't treat others the way we think we should, do we really deserve to be treated that way? And I think it is true that people reap what they sow in life. If we do things in the world that make others unhappy, that's only adding unhappiness to the world. Eventually it will become our world.|`|aOqoo4H7aa	The Golden Rule doesn't really have anything to do with karma.  To do unto others as you would have them do unto you is a social suggestion that keeps things running smoothly.  Karma is actually part of a very ancient world view, originating in the history of the Brahmans, in Vedanta.  It is the idea that the ANY actions you perform (good OR bad, which are value judgements) create a response in the world and in yourself and that each action accrues more karma, kind of like an eternal game of Tetris.  Karma yolks you to the world of illusion, to Maya, and forces you to continue the cycle of rebirth into life, which is suffering.  So, in answer to your question, I think that karma is an actual law of the universe, cause and effect.  The golden rule, however, is problematic.  What if you would have others scream in your face, or you would have others cause you harm?  It causes lots of contradiction issues.|`|tQq5lYIoaa	Now that you mention it, it is!  Praise the LORD!|`|1uvrkDWNaa	It's real.  Karma never comes around when you expect it to, but it is always on time.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	Karma is perhaps less mystical than most westerners understand it.    Basically, the law of karma states that your actions have consequences. How these consequences come about does not need to be understood as some magical circle, but we do know that you can't live a bad life forever and have good things happen to you. Sooner or later, your bad lifestyle will catch up with you.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Yes i believe. It may not come back to you, but being nice and helping others is payment enough.|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	I think you get what you give in the sense that if you're good to people, they in turn will be good to you. I'm unsure on the "karma" that happens where if you're good to people and you do good things, good things happen to you.|`|spYpsixUaa	I have three things to say about the nature of Karma.  1.  It's like Pascal's Wager.  2.  "Some things exist whether you believe in them or not."  3.  Pay it forward.
daza5A4vaa	Um, you could read something about somebody who's throwing their life away. That always makes me feel better about myself (:    Crank is a really good one.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	I'm not quite sure...interesting question though. I'll give you a little star thingy :D|`|o4iqmay8aa	This question is a little confusing. Do you need a book about a character who becomes confident, or one meant to inspire confidence in the reader?  Either way, the early Harry Potter books have a lot of 'overcoming the odds' factors, which could count as confidence builders. 'The Chocolate Wars' also has a sense of achievement to it, along with Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables'.  I'm sorry if that doesn't help, but I'm just a little confused. :)|`|vUBBIUXqaa	Keeping The Moon by Sarah Dessen.   It's a quick read and talks about self-esteem quite a bit in it.   I definitely walked away feeling more confident after i had read it.|`|6YDFF2YLaa	Lock and Key.  By Sarah Dessen. I think.  Hard question.
xOh6IXWsaa	If you want a story that really sucks you in I'd try either Perdido Street Station or The Scar by China Mieville, they're quite long and but really well written and compelling. Fantasy genre, but not like Lord of the Rings fantasy.  My favourite American literature would be To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, On the Road by Jack Kerouac and Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck they're all essential reading in my view.    You might want to try these, too:  American Psycho, Bret Easton Ellis  Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk  Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell  A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess  Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury    They're all I can think of right now, hope this helps.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Hm...     -No Logo by Naomi Klein - non-fic about branding in our society (that's American culture for sure! Though it's written by a Canadian)  - Kushiel's Dart - the first of 6 about an alternate Renaissance Europe, where everything is the same but the religion (so everything is actually different). Gets explicit though.   - Storm Front by Jim Butcher - the first of the Dresden files series, a funny urban fantasy series focusing on PI/wizard Harry Dresden in modern-day Chicago|`|AA11285960	On the Road by Jack Kerouac|`|pqOLekE7aa	I really enjoyed Enders game. its a Sci-Fi book. I really enjoyed it and got into it. Its also the first book in a series of 3 or 4 i believe.|`|iT9S20zvaa	If you want something meaningful, I'd suggest Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.  This book greatly impacted me, though I read it on my own (not required when I was in school).    Anything by Kurt Vonnegut or Ray Bradbury (my favorite authors).  These guys are just incredible writers with unusual and interesting plots.      Although this definitely will not help you with understanding American culture (it's about another culture entirely), Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is a great read.  I was impressed and surprised, and I loved the writing.  I did not expect to enjoy this at all.  My sister also loves it.    My sister also read Les Miserables by Victor Hugo.  I know, horribly long book...An English teacher actually asked her why she would read something so long, which I find hilarious.  My sister, same one mentioned above, says that this is the greatest book she has ever read.  I don't take such a statement from her lightly.  I plan to read it...when I have time.    Also, I enjoyed Last Seen Leaving by Kelly Braffet, though those I know who have read it are mixed in opinions (hate or like; there's language, maybe some drug use, etc.).    I don't know if this helps you any, but I do hope it does.  Good luck.|`|Ilo7pVhUaa	"Crank", "Burned", "Impulse", "Glass" by Ellen Hopkins  "Go Ask Alice" by Anonymous  "When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit" by Judith Kerr  "What Happened to Lani Garver" by Carol Plum-Ucci|`|1hGk51Waaa	The Shack - by William Paul Young (just got done reading this one - breath taking AWESOME book)  October Sky - Homer Hick am   Where Are The Children - by Mary Higgins Clark  They Cage Animals At Night - by Jennings Michael Burch  The Beach House - by James Patterson    those are a few of my favorite books|`|vXbUpjaaaa	im on pg 47 of message in a bottle by nicholas sparks! i like it so far!! :]|`|vUBBIUXqaa	(a few examples.)

v70p2kgWaa	If it has more than one person it is a dialog.  By its name a monologue is one person.    Hamlet has a fun but long exchange with a gravedigger just before the famous "To be, or not to be" speech.  However here is a shorter one that plays word games as well.  This is from Twelfth Night 1.5.33-62.    OLIVIA.  Take the fool away.    CLOWN.  Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.    OLIVIA.  Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you  grow dishonest.    CLOWN.  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend:  for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the  dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer  dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything  that's mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but  patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.  If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,  what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so  beauty's a flower:--the lady bade take away the fool; therefore,  I say again, take her away.    OLIVIA.  Sir, I bade them take away you.    CLOWN.  Misprision in the highest degree!--Lady, Cucullus non facit  monachum; that's as much to say, I wear not motley in my  brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.    OLIVIA.  Can you do it?    CLOWN.  Dexteriously, good madonna.    OLIVIA.  Make your proof.    CLOWN.  I must catechize you for it, madonna.  Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.    OLIVIA.  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll 'bide your proof.    CLOWN.  Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?    OLIVIA.  Good fool, for my brother's death.    CLOWN.  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.    OLIVIA.  I know his soul is in heaven, fool.    CLOWN.  The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul  being in heaven.--Take away the fool, gentlemen.|`|u25R7XIGaa	1. There's no such thing as a two-person monologue; that's a dialogue.   2. Specify a little more what you're looking for.    EDIT: The to be or not to be speech is way ahead of the gravedigger scene. That's after he comes back to Denmark. Don't go looking for it by way of that... o_e I've done stuff like that and wasted a lot of time...

NXbr4FnTaa	Hitler came to power in 1933 because Hindenburg and others thought that they could control Hitler, so they allowed him to become Chancellor.    Hitler also had the support of about 1/3 of the German electorate, so Hindenburg and others thought Hitler should be accommodated to make the government look legitimate.    In 1930, Hitler got a lot of publicity for his opposition to the Young Plan.  Suddenly Hitler looked like a respectable politician who was defending the interests of Germans.    Germans,especially the middle class, were most afraid of a communist takeover after 1929.  Hitler promised to protect Germany from that, and the SA actually got into street fights with communists to prove it.    All the other parties in Germany were divided amongst themselves because of their ideological differences (communists, socialists, liberals and conservatives could not get along, and Germany had all these parties and more).  No one party united Germans as much as the Nazis.  The Nazis appealed to many demographic groups in Germany by telling them all what they wanted to hear, even if the Nazis had to lie to people.|`|AYct1ZFRaa	I can tell you how he got so many people to come hear his Speech.....

You're giving up your last bits of food to keep your children from dying of starvation.....

4SwyBiMkaa	A young girl stays home by herself, with only her dog to protect her. When it's time to go to bed, she locks all the doors and tries to lock all the windows. But the window in the basement won't close. She decides to leave it open, but locks the basement door.   Her dog takes it's customary place under her bed, and she falls asleep. She wakes up to a dripping noise. She sticks her hand under her bed and feels a reassuring lick from her dog. She falls back asleep, but wakes up again to the dripping sound, and again recieves a reassuring lick from her dog.   But when she wakes up the third time, she decides to go see what's up. As she gets closer to the bathroom, the dripping gets louder.    When she walks into the bathroom, she sees a horrific sight. Her dog is hanging in the shower with it's throat slit open. On the mirror, written in her dog's blood, are the words "Humans Can Lick Too"|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	A girl gets possessed by the Ouija board spirits :)
DvToP5h7aa	To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee    I see what you mean, she has not been done any favours, perhaps that is the point the author is making, she is not the most popular character.      About Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose     Boo may be the ghost of Scouts neighborhood, but Mrs. Dubose is the dragon. Scout introduces her as plain hell (1.14)    Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which was always nothing. (11.3)    Despite being confined to a wheelchair most of the time, Mrs. Dubose has the power to inspire rage and fear just through the power of her words. Closer up, her appearance alone is enough to gross Scout out.    Cords of saliva would collect on her lips; she would draw them in, then open her mouth again. Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally it would say, "Pt," like some viscous substance coming to a boil. (11.86)    For Scout, Mrs. Dubose is a distressing object, a force that takes over their afternoons after Jem goes crazy on her camellias, barely human. Its not until after she dies that Scout and Jem get a sense of whats going on behind the drool and venom: Mrs. Dubose is a morphine addict who had vowed to go clean before she died, and enlisted Jem and Scout (without their knowledge) to keep her off the stuff for longer and longer periods of time. Atticus tells the kids the lesson he hopes theyve learned from her.    I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew. (11.*)    Even though no one would have blamed Mrs. Dubose if she had wanted to leave this world in narcotic bliss, she decided to try to do what she felt was right, no matter how impossible it seemed or how painful it was. Hmm, sounds like a person whose name begins with A and ends with tticus. Overcoming Mrs. Dubose is a valuable experience for both Jem and Scout as they move unknowingly towards the Robinson trial, though its unclear whether admiring her bravery or learning to brave her cantankerousness without exploding is the more useful lesson.     http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...|`|ZE84xfruaa	To show how old and sick she really is.

I am an avid romance novel reader, and even I have to admit that the romance genre is littered with HORRIBLE works of fiction. Usually, once I find an author I like, I read all of their novels because it's usually a guarantee that I will like them. My favorite authors include:    Kathleen E. Woodiwiss  Johanna Lindsay  Susan Elizabeth Phillips  Julia Quinn  Heather Graham  Karen Marie Moning  Kat Martin    Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a contemporary author whose books are filled with sexual tension and humor. I love every one of them!    Karen Marie Moning's books are time travel/fantasy based and the characters are so easy to fall in love with.    Kat Martin writes both conteporary and historical- one of my favorite books is one called Night Secrets by her. It was inspired by an old old song called "Brandy" by Looking Glass. Her contemporary book Hot Rain is VERY steamy and adventerous, also one of my favorite.    Johanna Lindsay writes all historical romance and has a lot of series books. The Malory series is fantastic. Funny, unique characters with strong family bonds and hillarious situations!    Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is an older historical romance writer. I enjoy her books a lot, but her writing style is very different from most newer authors. She is very descriptive and her books have a lot of character development in them. Her plots tend to move very slowly and she does not have deeply descriptive sex scenes, but her writing is good and something about it keeps be reading her books over and over again!|`|KjF0p72naa	Jane Austin books are fantastic!

Z19gRYZwaa	Some authors just have quirks like that, and I don't really think it's the editor's business to go changing it, since it's a relatively minor stylistic issue, and doesn't bug most people that much. I know what you mean about it being distracting though: I have an author I really like who uses the phrase "palm uppermost" constantly, and there's another book I liked that had the word genuflect in it WAY more than was really necessary. Just do your best to ignore it.|`|LjNJiqCZaa	It's not an unusual word choice, that's probably how it's slipped through.  Broaden your horizons.
hwoNA90oaa	Okay, I had the same problem as with most authors when they are trying to find a good setting for their book. In fact the setting of your book is one of the most important aspects so choose it carefully and wisely. I suggest you google states in the U.S that has a great amount of trees or whatever you want your setting to have. Google will provide you with sites and one of them are bound to have a list of states that have what your looking for. Pick a state that sounds good out of that list, go to city-data.com, put that state name into the search bar that is at the bottom, and choose whatever town you want. Also when searching you can even choose the population number, if you want a small town or big town. City Data gives you a whole bunch of info on your selected place, like hot spots, weather, population, schools, pictures, etc. If they dont list the school just go to greatschools.com.  Everything I listed above is what I did to find my state and town that I am very happy with.|`|WAOJLC9Yaa	wats ur book about..?|`|Dkk5HwbEaa	Places just north of central California seem to fit your weather description.|`|exB1zxgVaa	Gatlinburg, TN.

Snow is rare, but has occurred (I know, I thought global WARMING was the problem).    I've visited North Carolina, and the temperatures are normal, but can get really cold. I've never seen snow there, but that's because I always go in the Summer.    I don't know what California's like, but I've always wanted to visit! That might be a good setting.    Good Luck :)

bdYXd8exaa	1. She almost dies because since the baby is half-vampire, it is much stronger than Bella and it breaks her ribs and some other bones. The baby is just too much for Bella's weak human body.    2. Jacob imprints on Renesmee, Edward and Bella's daughter, and will not age anymore, and Renesmee will stop aging when she is about 17 years old.    3. The Cullens gather vampires around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake. Then the Volturi decide that they are not sure if Renesmee is still a threat or not, so Alice and Jasper return with Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like Renesmee. He demonstrates that the crossbreeds have no threat and the Volturi leave, knowing that they no longer have just reason to destroy Renesmee. The Cullens basically remain as they were, except they have a new family member, Bella.    4. Edward does not die.    hope this helps =]|`|6HOcthxaaa	woah stop there edward DOES NOT die !!!!  no he doesnt bella gets pregnant while she is still human and the baby (renesme) is feeding off her to stay alive...then she starts driking blood and bella and nessie get better. then nessie is growing so she rips her way out of bella, she almost dies but edward injects her with venom and she becomes a vampire. then jacob..he falls in love or imprints renesme. mabey you should just read the book?|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Haha your so wrong.   Edward lives, Bella gets pregnant and the baby kills her during childbirth, Edward and Jacob get together to protect the baby that Bella had and they become a item, the Cullens all become lovers to in a bid to help Edward and Jacob and Edward dies during sex with Jacob.|`|cHxaWW0taa	I must have missed a page... as far as I was aware Edward survived silly me!|`|jfEOIeSIaa	EDWARD DOESN"T DIE    she almost dies because the baby is too strong for her body to handle  Jacob becomes imprinted on their daughter and stays close to the family  The cullens stay as they were|`|ICzM3T8taa	Edward doesn't die for one.  Because the baby is using her blood for its thirst.  Can't remember.  They live happily ever after.  Doesn't die.|`|bfhsP4GFaa	Since when does Edward die? The last page of the book is Bella stretching her mind block so he can see how she felt through their relationship. That's definitely wrong.  Bella is weaker than the baby growing inside her, so her bones break and the baby (who is named Renesmee - a combination of Bella's mother Renee and Edwards mother figure, Esme) accidentally sucks all of the nutrients out of her. When she gets too strong, she then rips herself out of Bella's body, and Edward has to change her to save her life.  Jacob imprints on Renesmee (they're now "soulmates") and he sticks around, looking out for her. He ends up phasing (changing into a werewolf) in front of Charlie to convince him to come and see Bella after she's changed, so Charlie then knows there's something different about all of them, but he's happy that he can stay in his daughter, and new grandaughters life.  The Volturi come to town to kill Renesmee, but everyone just ends up talking. It was stupid really, the whole book being built up over this huge "war" that was going to happen between the Volturi and the Cullens/their friends, and they end up talking it out.|`|UBUoqsL4aa	One of the reasons she also almost dies is because because the baby "eats" her way out of Bellas body.

She almost dies during pregnancy because she had sex with a vampire an so the child was going to be half-vampire, half-human and the only way for her to get out would be for the child to eat her way out of her mother's womb. I know OW right. lol Um Jacob imprints on Reneesme (Edward and Bella's daughter). The Cullen family stays sexy and lives happily ever after. yay them! lol Edward DOES NOT DIE! He's a vampire remember? lol|`|4SwyBiMkaa	1. Edward doesn't die  2.

I know it doesn't show it much but there is romance in it   I'd never given much thought to how I would die  though I'd had reason  enough in the last few months  but even if I had, I would not have  imagined it like this.  I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the  hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me.  Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved.  Noble, even. That ought to count for something.  I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But,  terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When  life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not  reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.  The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill
xfqHi1tRaa	No -- but I'm not writing your essay for you!|`|t79pLOCUaa	It might have done if the US had chosen to join the League.|`|lIRCcWpSaa	His idea of self determination certainly lead to more harm than good, leading to some countries using it as an excuse to commit acts of genocide in order to create a "one-nation state"..... if self determination was enacted upon the USA then it would become a fifty nation state rather than a one-nation state.....    It also made the Nazi domination of Europe alot easier, hence why Hitler conquered Europe within a year.....too many small nations unable to defend themselves due to their size..    I would not get too bogged down in the legal stuff about the Treaty of Versailles, just look at research already done about it....the best things you want to be looking at is Wilson's ideals in relation to Europe, how he wanted to break up old empires, in particular Britain and the Ottoman Empire (Treaty of Sevres) in order to spread democracy. However this backfired when most nations could not wait to throw off the terms they had to agree to at the Paris Peace Conference.    I should not be talking about that because the question asks about the Treaty of Versailles, remember that the T of V only applies to Germany!!!    I suppose you could talk about the ideas of colonialism and democracy in context as I just mentioned (how his ideals were within the treaty), but if it is asking specifically about the T of V than you could talk about it in relation to Germany. (eg giving up its overseas territories, banning a union with Austria, creation of Czechoslovakia, etc......)    If I come up with any more ideas I shall post them here :)    Another thought.....Germany got away with alot under the T of V, it was never broken up (with the acception of the newly formed enclave of Eastern Prussia, which is something which would further embitter the Germans) and left with its political system and country intact, bits were taken off but as a whole its borders kept it as one nation, still very dominant in Europe. The T of V gave independence to large groups of peoples whom did not consider themselves German on the edges of Germany. But Germany mostly remained as it had done before WW1, beaten but not defeated. Germany flirted with Wilson's idea of democracy and tried to abandon colonialism, but the passion of what went before was too great for the Germans to forget.    Thought - some interesting reading on Wikipedia.....  Clemenceau had failed to achieve all of the demands of the French people, and he was voted out of office in the elections of January 1920. French Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch, who felt the restrictions on Germany were too lenient, declared, "This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years."[19]    Influenced by the opposition of Henry Cabot Lodge, the United States Senate voted against ratifying the treaty. Despite considerable debate, Wilson refused to support the treaty with any of the reservations imposed by the Senate.[20] As a result, the United States did not join the League of Nations, despite Wilson's claims that he could "predict with absolute certainty that within another generation there will be another world war if the nations of the world do not concert the method by which to prevent it."[21]    Wilson's friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919:    "I am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_V...    In regards to Article 22, I have just quickly read it and I think it means that nations once under occupation shall be entrusted onto other (victor) nations to look after their "well-being". eg Britain was given a mandate to look after Palestine, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Tanganyika. France got Syria. Britan and France shared the mandate in regards to Kamerun(Cameroon) and Togoland. Other nations were granted mandates which you can research using this link...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_N...    *** Britain and France had many overseas territories, and after the signing of the treaties they owned many more. However they were on the winning side so did not have to give up any of their territory.***

Rory Emerald does not like people writing his biography and will tie you up in litigation.  It took me a year to write my biography of him and I have been through the legal system for the past 12 years.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	Only if you want to sell it.    You can write a biography without an agent. They just help you sell the bio to the publishers.    edit:  1: Keep trying  2: Get some support from the media or from someone with influence. Usually, the publicist will cave under the pressure.   3: Write an unauthorized biography.  4: Maybe getting an agent would help things. People seem to like it when you use your people to navigate other people's people.|`|8asG4WCwaa	1 - they may not be interested in an unknown author doing a biography (since you are asking help here, I'm pretty certain you are not a known author)  2 - they may already have someone doing it  3 - they get hundreds of requests every day from people who want something (from an autographs to used laundry - fans are weird)   4 - some people just do not want to have a biography done on them
X2zwBlgJaa	read the Cirque du Freak series!!!!    they are the best!!! its a vampire story  a kid goes to a freak show with his best friend. and the freak show is well, FREAKY! Darren (the main character) comes to the place where the show was and steals one of the acts, the spider. little did darren know is that his best friend would be bitten by the spider and come near death. Darren must chose between saving his friend, or becoming half vampire and assisting mr. crepsly. the original owner of the spider is a vampire, and is the only one known to Darren who has the anti-dote to this deadly venom. Darren choses to save his friend, and becomes a half vampire. this is his story of his like as a half vampire.    ive had all the books since yesterday, (1/31/09) and am already on book 4 (2/1/09) i  THIS STORY IS NOT LIKE TWILIGHT IN MOST WAYS.    *edit* this series has twelve books in it.  the first is Cirque Du Freak, ask for that, and any library or book store will know what your talking about|`|5L5GQYFXaa	I liked the Mates And Dates collection which incudes: Cosmic kisses, sleepover secrets,inflatable bras.

jN0njYgjaa	team motherfu.. or team cock... what do u think of that???|`|MlZay5VHaa	Good god...will these questions never stop flooding in?    I'd choose Jacob because Edward's big mistake is overreaction. It's in his nature to be too extreme. He's a very all-or-nothing kind of person, and it makes him unreasonable. In the beginning of Eclipse, he's too overprotective. When he sees the error of his ways, he goes too far in the other direction. He could have chosen a middle groundmaybe admitted to his jealousy and asked Bella to choose him, rather than watching her get in deeper with Jacob. Of course, he has other issues that make forcing this issue problematic. What if Jacob is better for her? What if Bella could have a more complete life with him? Should Edward really insist that Bella give everything up for vampire life? Or would it be better to let her make a fully informed choice? Can you see his dilemma? Part of Edward wants Bella to choose Jacob.    Jacob doesn't have a tragic flaw. He has one goal and one hope. His goal is to save Bella's life. His hope is that he'll win her heart in the process. He fails at both. But that doesn't mean he regrets trying. If he could do it over again, he'd do the same thing. Jacob couldn't live with himself if he didn't give saving Bella his best efforthe knows it's going to hurt when he loses, but he knows it would hurt worse if he didn't try. Does he do everything right? Heck, no! But he's sixteen and he's making it up as he goes along. Those who are upset by some of his tactics should consider his youth and the fact that he is, after all, right. Bella is in love with him. (In the end, it's truly healthier for her to be aware of this as she goes forward with unalterable decisions.) Also, I like Jacob because he doesn't baby Bella like Edward does. Jacob knows that Bella is capable of handling dangerous situations. I wouldn't want my boyfriend treating me like a helpless kid would you?    Oh I almost forgot. There is a downside to choosing Jacob. If Bella chose Jacob instead of Edward, she would always have to worry about Jacob imprinting later on. What if he did imprint on someone else? Even though Jacob said that if he did imprint he wouldn't leave Bella, if he did end up imprinting, he would have no choice but to do just that: leave Bella. It happened to Sam. What makes you think that Jacob's situation would be different?    Edward manipulated Bella into marrying him. You should NOT get married unless it is something that you wholeheartedly want to do. Edward knows that she doesn't want to get married, but he uses sex as a bargaining tool to get her to marry him! Jake is also a bit manipulative. He manipulated Bella into asking him to kiss her, but this is good for her in the end because she accepts the fact that she loves him.  Edward is way too controlling over Bella. He dismantles her car and forcefully prevents her from visiting Jake and he makes his sister kidnap her. Jacob always gives Bella a choice in every matter and he never forces her to do anything (except kiss him lol which is pretty bad.)  Edward is WAY too overprotective. He never gives Bella any space and he always has to be her eyes and her brain and her hands and her legs...you get my point. He never lets Bella solve her own problems, while Jacob lets Bella have fun and take risks.  Edward doesn't care about those around him. Like in New Moon when he decides to pull a Romeo and kill himself. He knows that his death will devastate his family, yet he attempts to get himself killed anyway. Jacob cares for his family. He takes care of his Dad all the time and he would never abandon him for a long period of time (he left once but only for a little while).    ****BREAKING DAWN SPOILER BELOW****      A lot of people say they hate Jake because he imprinted of Renesmee, and I have to come to Jacob's defense here. First of all, it's not his fault that he imprinted on a child. A werewolf never gets to choose who he imprints on. Take Sam for example. He loved Leah before he loved Emily. If he had the ability to choose to imprint on someone, he would've chosen Leah long before Emily came into the picture. Secondly, imprinting on a child doesn't mean that Jacob is attracted to that child in a romantic or a sexual way. It just means that he wants with all his heart to protect that child and to make her happy....like a really loving big brother. Jacob won't have any romantic feelings towards Renesmee for a VERY long time. Meyer clearly states this in New Moon and on her website.|`|tZF1FO7saa	team harry potter!  and if someone says team switzerland i am going to SCREAM|`|vBwVheaXaa	Team switzerland!!! lololololololololololol (hehee)    ....don't get this question    If it's to do with Twilight then xxxTeam Edwardxxx|`|z81JIycpaa	Team Switzerland.

I kind of forgot it though because I read the book and watched the movie two years ago.|`|MYCJZsAmaa	I personally love both.  The movie was good because a lot of my favorite actors are in it.  But if the book is read right....it is amazing as well.|`|ecYv94Y2aa	I think, it's whatever you read first. I read the book first, so I watched the movie knowing everything that would happen next. It takes out the suspense. If I had watched the movie it would have make the book less exciting.

WshwHtk9aa	It doesn't matter that you once had it, any more than if you once had a TV but lost it. You wouldn't be allowed to go just take another TV from a shop because that would be STEALING. It is exactly the same thing. If you lost the printed Twilight book, you could not just go into Borders and TAKE another one--but that is what it sounds like you want to do now. Why do you think the audio version is any different?   Answer: It isn't.    And while you may not want to hear that it is ILLEGAL, you NEED to, because IT IS.    The only fair way to deal with this is to go back to the site you bought it from, contact their customer service department, and explain the situation to them. Most will let you re-download a book if they have a record of you previously buying it.  You might also try a local library, but that download will only be temporary.    Doing elsewise makes you a CRIMINAL.    (And I've made something of a hobby of reporting criminals to the publishers in recent weeks. I've already sent in the accounts of 3 people since Friday who were requesting stealing a book and admitted to knowing it was illegal to do so. I'm sure when they are schilling out $20,000 in legal fees they'll wish they'd just spent $14.95 to buy it legitimately. I've saved this thread, so deleting it won't matter any. Just do the right thing.)|`|9UAg6EvTaa	i wish i knew..  but if u find out please let me know! :)|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Oh god, just go buy the actually cd itself then you won't resort to lying about having it before and it being deleted and this is the only excuse you can make up.
AA12268495	Lol, you're totally right :) Like you, I am too old for this series ~ but got hooked anyway.     One of the things I liked about it, was it reminded me of what it was like to be a stupid, hormone fueled angst ridden teenager. That having been said ~ I totally understand Bella's attachment w/Edward, because I always fell for the bad boy when I was younger. My relationships were completely wrong & unhealthy... but my boyfriends were hot, the sex was fantastic & there was plenty of stupid drama to keep things interesting, lol :)    But if you are that bothered by the weirdness/creepiness of the whole Bella/Edward thing ~ you are probably right to quit reading now. It just gets way worse as the series continues... Breaking Dawn is especially bad.     As much as I enjoyed the books, if I had a daughter, I would certainly never let her read them ~ Bella is a horrible role model for young girls.    EDIT: I'll be 36 in a few days, so maybe that is why I also see the creepiness. Just wait until you read all about the Quilete "imprinting" ~ Meyer takes unhealthy relationships to a whole new level!|`|m3rt9x8Caa	ARGHHHHH nooo    Edward is a way better character than jacob, jacob is SO annoying in the other books trust me, especially in breaking dawn... well i'm not going to ruin it for you because i highly advise you to read the other books, you never know you might think differently about there love.    oh my god though trust me, jacob is so annoying i hate him.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	....|`|0Aqyky1Qaa	Actually I'm 16, and I agree, Jacob was perfect for Bella, he's sweet and lovely and partly Human. Edwards controlling, stalkery and drinks blood ;) although I do lobe Edward too. I think no matter what age you are it depends on the way you think; some people prefer Edward and some people lobe Jacob :P|`|0GxV0gnaaa	Because he is her first love, and only true love. I know Jacob would probably be better for her but if you found out your "soul mate" had just tried to committ suicide because he thought you had died I would think that their love is just stronger. to her it wasn't obsessive etc she just loved Edward more.      you should read the next book, Jacob is still a very big part in her life and it turns into a big love triangle.|`|jN0njYgjaa	.................no comments.|`|80f8957313036f4f2509cf56af9cbb7aaa	cuz he's a vampire! and your old  I meant older than the target audience.   lawl  Besides, if you have read the other books, it would have been impossible for Jacob to love her if he imprinted on someone else.  Something you can only know from reading the other books.|`|It3m1WpAaa	Well if you think of Edward and Bella's relationship like that, I don't think you'll ever get it!  Anywhoo-    They really just love each other!  In other books (Eclipse) Bella says she loves Edward AND Jacob.  Edward and Bella are just meant to be together!!  Just read the books and don't think about it too deeply =]|`|vkhWdBLpaa	Hmm, you must keep in mind that well, Stephenie Meyer's old, too!  I think that yes, your right its like the most messed up thing to leave Jacob for Edward but she feels attracted to him and sometimes Jacob gets on her nerves, while on the other hand Edward leaves her alone as soon as he sees she's PO'd|`|QfMciQ27aa	I am (grudgingly) half way through New Moon. I thought Twilight was far too over rated with its creepy ideas etc, but i'm getting to like Jacobs character for actually bringing some colour to the story. I got so fed up with Bellas persistent whining and moaning and self pity (as usual) that if Jacob hadnt become the only decent character (from what ive read so far) then i'd have gave up on it already. I'm going to persevere with it and see if its any better.    EDIT - March_hare- i agree, i wouldnt encourage my sister to read these books, and she's 17. It is the one thing i hate about this series, the fact that unhealthy, destructive realtionships, with an obsessive and dangerous guy is seen as "perfect" and "love". Its this that chills me to the core, because it is this that teenage girls tak from the story. PS i'm 23.|`|sjrRM5y0aa	personally i am in love with jacob!  iv just finished eclipse, and still am so in love with him.  im not sure if jacob has imprinted on bella or not because she does love him back. I would prefer to be with Jacob out of the two of them simply because he is warm and not cold. Plus he seems so much more normal!  OH well. Eclipse is a great book, i prefer it to the first two, as I got a bit tired of the way Bella and Edward were behaving in the second. For example the way she moped around feeling sorry for herself. She is just a normal person yet can't deal with getting dumped like normal people. Fair enough it takes people different amounts of time to get over people but I have never heard of anyone being like her.    I think she is is just a bit of an idiot!    xxx|`|5iMja1Meaa	I guess this is the typical team Edward/Jacob argument...    I'm team Edward all the way...  especially after Book 3 - Eclipse :)|`|vgcaJgGhaa	my mum read the book after me. she loved it to. the whole point is she loved edward and she always had. yes she probably could have LEARNED to love jacob, and eventually i don't doubt she really would have loved him. but her and edward just had this bond. she never got over him. its a good series so you should read it, but if your finding the relationship creepy maybe twilight just isn't for you?|`|zdPu4z88aa	well that would make you a Jacob fan, and I would strongly suggest reading all four of them, because the last one wraps up the story nicely. However, I found Jacob a little creepy too.
A0meCxhgaa	Though many high school students would disagree, Shakespeare's work serves as a basis for modern day writing. So much of modern literature owes something to Shakespeare, that not reading it would dull our understandings of what we read now.    On another note, it's interesting to look at a quote by Dame Ellen Terry: "Wonderful women! Have you ever thought how much we all, and women especially, owe to Shakespear for his vindication of women in these fearless, high-spirited, resolute and intelligent heroines?"    He was before his time - before, during, and after.|`|SPQdFOwKaa	Because his works (at least his comedies and tragedies, his historical ones not so much) have a universal and timeless theme, they deal with matters that always troubled people, such as the nature of love, injustice, fate, tragedy, death, etc. Maybe some things have changed since his era (England of the 1600's), like the equality between men and women, the law system and the differences between the social classes, but even 400 years after his time, he remains true to the point.    Or just that schools fail to find a more modern theatrical writer - say like Arthur Miller - because Shakespeare is safe for school children - doesn't allow them to think much.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	The works of Shakespeare are timeless classics. He is to this day the best writer the world has known. He was prolific, funny, intuitive, a great storyteller and understood human nature to the fullest.     There are very few writers who won't agree that Shakespeare was an influence in one way or another.     There is much of Shakespeare that has worked its way into our everyday language and reference. People use those references and often don't even know they come from Shakespear.    Studying Shakespeare gives you a foundation for all other literature. His timeless themes have kept his work alive all these hundreds of years.|`|7I8gNo9Taa	he has great examples of english sonnets and his plays are well written and use iambic pentameter which is a standard to use. besides, if a man's plays can stick around 400 years, there has to be SOMETHING good about them :)|`|S2ByqJSmaa	His work captures the human experience.

He was a feminist and always described women as wonderful creatures who tempt fate and make risky choices without much consideration, having their hearts over their minds. The typical women of Fitzgerald's era, the kind of women who loved wealth, loved men who knew how to present themselves, loved to light fires, loved to attend public gatherings - nurturing their vanity with beautiful movements and words.|`|AA11703549	I think it's very telling of it's time.

If you're looking for authors with similar writing (though no one can trump Atwood, she's in a class all her own), I would suggest these authors:    - Gabriel Marquez Garcia (try "Love in the Time of Cholera" and "Of Love and Other Demons", though I recommend all his novels - they're great!)  - Yann Martel ("Life of Pi")  - Alice Sebold ("The Lovely Bones")  - Carol Shields   - Marge Piercy  - Annie Proulx  - Alice Walker  - Miriam Toews ("A Complicated Kindness")    Happy reading!|`|fHIXRFqHaa	Well, I have not read that book, but I have read Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood. I wouldn't know if they are comparable at any level; however, give it a try since Atwood is the author. I personally enjoyed the book a lot.
r7Vhc9zNaa	He starts out around 13-14 and I haven't read book 12 yet, but in 11 he's around 30, although he looks around 16.|`|zdPu4z88aa	I believe he is a teenager, about 16.    PS those books are amazing. I wasnt a big fan of the last one though.|`|5c8aec79499afe2770bde5cd81ef4f74aa	He starts of being around 14-16  But there are time skips, but since vampires age about 1/5 of the rate of humans he always looks very young.

DvToP5h7aa	The Catcher In The Rye - J. D. Salinger.    Chapter Twelve:    ?  Holden gets into a "vomity" cab with a driver named Horwitz. He's depressed about the empty New York streets, but asks anyway about the ducks and where they go in the winter when the lagoon freezes over.    ?  Horwitz doesn't know. He does add, however, that the fish stay right where they are. Their pores open up, he insists, and they take in nutrients from all the seaweed and stuff around them, even while they're frozen right there in place.    ?  Holden asks the guy if he wants to have a drink with him, but Horwitz replies that he has no time.    ?  As Holden exits the cab, Horwitz insists that the fish are taken care of, because Mother Nature wouldn't leave them to fend for themselves. He's quite worked up about the whole thing.

CUSMvIlFaa	As far as i know, they didn't get upset as such, just excited and stimulated. He was also not very successful in his time and those who rated him highly were his circle of friends. At this point in his life, he had been writing poetry fro several years and had given its purpose and meaning a lot of thought. Are human's achievements in art everlasting? He was inspired in part by seeing the Elgin Marbles (aka Parthenon frieze) at the British museum and the poem considers the meaning and value of man-made beauty. In this, he isn't just talking about beauty in the conventioal sense, but something that appeals to the imagination as perfect. The line in that poem 'Heifer lowing at the skies', for example, alludes to one of the cows on the frieze, which is sculpted with its head pulling upwards agnd backwards against the reins as it is being led to be sacrificed. There's nothing conventionally beautiful about a cow about to be killed, but Keats is meditating on the work itself, and how it has a reality in and of itself that is unchangable, and beautiful. Whoever created it has long gone and their artistic achievement is the truth they have left behind.   I could go on, but hopefully that's a start, let me know if you want more detail.......
qXTWnEzEaa	Please, can everyone stop saying "Vampires are too twilight."    WRONG.    Vampires are NOT too Twilight. There are thousands of vampire stories that have been published! Vampries are not 'too Twilight'. Who do you think created vampires? What about famous classics that deserve this rightful seat in the ranks of vampire stories?    Don't worry. It is nothing like Twilight. For starters, it is set in France, in (I assume) much older times.    Can people stop trying to stop others from writing vampire stories JUST because there's a poorly written book out named Twilight that every teenage girl who happens to be able to read is screaming in excitement over!?    We're talking about REAL Literature here, people! Not a book that got popular because of the female youth in this society!|`|5L5GQYFXaa	1-Vampires...Too twilight... you might want something still dark like princess/princes of darkness only an example..  2-If your characters are going to be so dark you might want to opte for more medievalish names:  guys:                                Althalos   Fendrel   Brom   Hadrian   Benedict   Gregory   Peter   Henry   Frederick   Walter   Thomas   Arthur   Bryce   Donald   Leofrick   Girls:  Ayleth   Anastas   Alianor   Cedany   Arabella   Elizabeth   Hildegard   Brunhild   Adelaide   Alice   Beatrix   Cristiana   Eleanor   Emeline   Isabel   Juliana   Margaret   Matilda   Mirabelle   Rose   Helena   Guinevere   Isolde   Maerwynn   Muriel   Winifred   Godiva   Catrain   Angmar   Gussalen     If you don't like Matt and Josh you could take names that fit for twins like:  Aiden, Andrew  Baker, Brandon  Caden, Connor  Daniel, Dylan  Ethan, Elijah  Gabriel, Gavin  Hayden, Hunter  Issac, Ian  Jackson, Jacob  Kyle, Kevin  Luke, Logan  Matthew, Michael  Nicholas, Noah  Owen, Oliver  Parker, Patrick  Richard, Robert  Samuel, Seth  Tyler, Tucker  Or more unsusual names like:  Asher, Ari  Boaz, Byron  Clay, Calvin  Dorian, Drake  Ezra, Elias  Ferris, Finnegan  Gage, Gareth  Heath, Hal  Ira, Ivan  Jaret, Jasper  Kieran, Kennan  Lyle, Levi  Marius, Malcolm  Nevin, Noam  Otis, Oren  Pierce, Perry  Quinn, Quenton  River, Reece  Sinclair, Stewart  Thane, Tobias  Von, Vance  Wade, Wynn  Zane, Zeb  Or names that dont have relations to each other at all:  Jacob, Caleb  Tyler, Ryan  Michael, Nicholas  Andrew, Daniel  Ethan, Jonathan  Noah, Logan  David, James  Asher, Issac  Brandon, Austin  Aaron, Evan  Jonah, Elijah  Travis, Mason  Matthew, Christopher  Nathaniel, Isaiah  Adrian, Gabriel  Blake, Hunter  Devin, Sebastian  Bryce, Marcus  Carter, Tanner  Derek, Jared  Max, Sam  Or you could make then rhyme:  Aiden, Caden, Braden, Jayden, Hayden  Shane, Blaine, Dane, Thane, Wayne, Zane  Taylor, Kaylor, Baylor  Cade, Wade  Evan, Devin, Kevin, Nevin  Tyler, Skyler  Cody, Brody  Cole, Noel  Kyle, Lyle  Blake, Drake, Jake  Eric, Derek  Miles, Niles  Luke, Duke  Trent, Brent   Hope i helped|`|N0A8mCuzaa	Don't use Cloei as your main girl.     The guys should be 17 . . . please no vampire or something. Then you think of Twilight . . . =( Even though there are other vampire books, right now, this is the most popular one and all eyes shift towards it . . . it's your choice what you want to do. I'm just giving you a suggestion.    There isn't really anything wrong about MG's name except the fact that it's your name. Try to think of a name that you'd want other than that, does this girl have traits like yours?    Josh and Matt works for the brothers very well. Two names that can go easy together.    The MG's bros are good too, both opposite each other . . .    Mitch sorta sounds like a weird name to give a bad guy but  . . . seeing as it's usually given to a more sweeter character.      Some Girl Names:    Ambry  Anna  Brienna  Cora  Claire  Cleo  Clarisse  Holly  Dyana  Demetria  Gisella  Mera (belle)  Ava  Cadie  Cami (lla)    Guy Names:    Aidan  Caden  Colton  Bryce  Bryton  Jake  Jason  Ryan|`|MI2U5sWyaa	wow i think ur book is great and the maes are fine|`|AyMg1f9Qaa	you should pick some other kind of mythical creature.  Vampires are to common now.  All i can think of is twilight, and that's hard book to compare to.  but the names seem fine to me.  i like the guy name Owen if that helps|`|FPY8RbCdaa	I like the simplicity of the human names... vs the different names...maybe change mitch, haha to something more like Xavier..  as for the plot of vampires...people!! there have been books about vampires before twilight!!! Don't worry about it, if you want to write a story about vampires, then do it.  Make sure though that your story is very descriptive and nicely detailed(good bringing in Romania and the background) .  good luck =]

Thought he movie is still good.|`|AA12041135	never saw the movie, read the book a few years ago and i really like it, it's pretty interesting.|`|ps5qDKzUaa	im reading the book right now, and its good so far, and im seeing the movie tommoror, so i hope i like both!
WXExyAlWaa	I think Cedric's was, because it was so out of his hands and he was so young. His death seemed so very symbolic to me because he was this really athletic, attractive, intelligent, good-natured person who could probably have done just about anything he wanted, and he was struck down for absolutely no reason - which is what war does. It's a very tragic thing.    Sirius to me... while it was sad that his life went so wrong, he had fatal flaws in his character that lead him down that path, and there were certain aspects of his personality that just made me really not like him that much.|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	SEVERUS SNAPE.    Gawwd.    I was freaking bawling. :'(|`|HGMCvkc9aa	you're not a vampire.  nice try though.|`|exB1zxgVaa	Cedric, most definately. i only say tht becuase of Rob.. but hey, I am a Jackson rathbone fan all the way, I even named my kitten Jasper :)|`|1ZT39UkWaa	Sirius Black! Harry's last remaining sort-of-relative that actually cares about him???  Losing him was a complete tragedy    Cedric was sad, but let's face it.    Sirius was worse. Harry was closer to him lol  btw Bella? If you ever decide Edward's not for you? Feel Free to send him my way ;)|`|mNTFcIt3aa	Vampire huh? Well I'm a giant opossum that sucks vampires brains, out runs their guts through a meat grinder where I will then happily devour them with a side of chocolate milk and mashed potatoes. =)    Death isn't sad.|`|xdKF0PNIaa	I have little sympathy for those idiotic wizards who got themselves killed!    Although, I must say that it was sad when Sirius died- Harry had finally found someone that could be his family (excluding the Dursleys, not that they were much of a family) and I was so upset for him. Tonks & Lupin's death was sad as well. I felt sorry for Teddy :( And when the Weasley twin died I was a little upset...    But being a gloriously beautiful vampire, I really have not spent a lot of time mourning their deaths.
w3uYxwiraa	You're allowed. Think of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. There must be a hundred books, songs, movies etc mentioned by name, and the author surely didn't get permission from everyone! Just don't paint WoW or other mentioned games in a bad light or make untrue statements and they won't care.
