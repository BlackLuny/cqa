20090203132516AAdtZCt	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	My iPod's music is gone, and I have extra "Other"!?	just plugged my iPod touch into the computer to charge it, the first time I plugged it in it didn't begin to charge. I unplugged it from the computer, then back in, and it began to charge, but it wasn't being recognized by iTunes (it wasn't showing up on the left side with music, videos, etc.). I rebooted it (held home and sleep/power) and iTunes recognized it after that. But my music and videos are gone!!!! The apps and photos are still on there, and I'm guessing the settings are too because it asked for the passcode when it powered up.  There is also 4.5GB designated to "Other,"  which is roughly how much music/video was on there.  Why is this, and how can I prevent this in the future?  And how can I free that space back up?

20060928043130AAVGuNT	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	IPod question . . .?	Is there a way to permenantly keep two songs connected?  For example:  Van Halen song(s) Eruption and You Really Got me just kind of blend together (Version 7 of iTunes has a crossfade mode so there's now no split second pause between tracks for live albums and songs like the above mentioned).  However if I put the iPod into random play mode I will only get one song but not both together.  Is there a way to keep songs like this permanently together?  Hopefully I've been clear enough with this question.  Thanks in advance.

20070110153256AAINMBa	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Should I file a T-Mobile Lawsuit for Charging me $200 for a Razor Phone They are Keeping?	T-Mobile's National Returns Center accepted a UPS package of a Refurbished Razor Replacement Handset with stickers still intact on the device (which they received after their deadline date and refuse to return the item). On January 6, 2007, T-mobile wrongfully disconnected my service for non payment of a $200 Restocking Fee Charge after they accepted a Newly Refurbished Handset. Unfortunately, I have dealt with Rude, Patronizing, Unprofessional, and Raised Stern Voice Supervisors. I have spoken to each Rep in a very Kind & Professional manner. This is not acceptable practice. My service has been interrupted for expected payment on a product that T-Mobile is in possession of while I am expected to remain empty handed. A company will not charge a customer for an item and keep the item in return. This is nothing short of theft and should be handled legally. T-Mobile refuses to respond once again. Although, T-Mobile has completely ignored my concerns as a paying customer should I sue?
