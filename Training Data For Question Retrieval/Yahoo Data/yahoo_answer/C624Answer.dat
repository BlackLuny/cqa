WeSdUJy9aa	Well you could try to make him a CD.  I know that's kinda old-fashioned but it's sweet.|`|lbt0ayPuaa	hey how r u 2night??? i wanna show u something cool i bought off of ebay...and bring him into ur room and say u gotta take ur shirt off cause this thing is a surprise 4 u and it goes on ur chest...and say keep ur eyes closed ill get it...and u get naked or at least in ur boxers...hope i helped....im glad u are proud 2 admit u are gay and most of my guy friends that r gay wont even admit it...:P|`|hXnxqzH9aa	Well, I've never been gay or a lesbian before so I don't know what it's like. I'd like to tell that whatever works for you do it.|`|8umXlm1Jaa	Give him a good seeing to, or if he is the dominant one, let him give YOU a good seeing to. Its still a bloke lol!|`|Xyma3z7Jaa	Your sexual orientation doesn't matter....but KUDOS FOR BEING PROUD OF IT ^.^<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would say that you should plan a whole day where its just you and him....rent his favorite movie as well as yours and watch movies all night while you cuddle on the couch<br>  <br>  Go out to dennys or george webbs maybe, or where ever you like to eat and make it your treat<br>  ask him what he wants to do lol!<br>  <br>  hope that helped a little|`|9kvR0zpBaa	you can get really physical with him. he'll like it if you 2 can be completely alone together for sure. i would just say to do what feels right. if hes with you then you dont have to impress him to show him that you love hiim. he knows :)|`|AA11103763	Definitely make a day all about him! You know his likes and dislikes so use that knowledge and have fun.<br>  <br>  More power to you for being honest with yourself and your preferences too. :)|`|ICUOfFEOaa	Awww that's nice. <br>  I agree with the guy that said the movie and the couch and the food.|`|zxVfTFoEaa	make him dinner|`|FmvnC8keaa	Hii! Okay so just pay attention to what your guy likes. For example, if he likes a certain artist maybe you can surprise him with concert tickets. Or if you guys have some special saying/inside joke etc. maybe find some sort of a gift or something that has something to do with that, or you could tell him you love him and do something really special that you know he will love, but I couldn't exactly say because I don't know exactly what type of things he likes - be creative :]
pMsMx817aa	From what I understand [your grammar is horrible...] you're asking if shes crazy for being 18 and getting married in 2 months, correct?<br>  <br>  well no she's not crazy, if her and her fiance feel that they are both ready to be married then you should support them and be happy for them.<br>  <br>  Im almost eighteen and will be getting married this july, I know people dont think its a good idea.  For alot of teen couples its not, but for me and my fiance it is, we are both ready and we don't want to wait til we're 25.  Thats just us, thats who we are.<br>  <br>  Just support her, and worry about your own relationship<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats<br>  ella<br>  (i know you support her, im just stating that you should and good job for doing so)|`|QenW1Ok7aa	I see no reason not to get married at 18, as long as you are already living on your own and paying all of your bills.<br>  <br>   Also, people seem to forget that the female human body was designed to be most fertile between the ages of 14-24. Your fertility starts to decrease as soon as you turn 26, and it decreases DRAMATICALLY when you turn 28.<br>  <br>   So waiting until you're 25 seems a bit late to me, because then you have to RUSH to have kids right away.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	It is different for everyone.  Just because you are waiting doesn't mean everyone else has to.  Are you just a little jealous because she is getting married sooner?|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's what she wants to do and what she feels is best for her.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	It depends on the person, if they are matured, mentally and emotionally and prepared to enter into a marriage at 18. There is really no set rule as to when to get married, just when you are ready, and if she isn't ready and is still going through with it, she is the only one who will have to deal with the consequences when it falls apart.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	You're right by supporting her.  Her timing may be right.. Who knows.  We never know how someone else's relationship is, no matter HOW close we are to them...<br>  <br>  It's good that you are waiting..<br>  <br>  When I was 19, I fell in love with my first love, and dated him for 3 1/2 years... I thought I wanted to marry him, and couldn't wait... But, needless to say, it ended and I am now engaged at 24 and will be married at 25.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The best thing I could say is...  For me onlooking others, I think people wait, because once you hit 21 your life changes... You may have "partied" for years prior, but being allows so much more, and a lot of people tend to want to stay single during this time....|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Well, I giver her credit for even wanting to go at it...I didn't think about marriage until I was 24 and I met my husband within that same year.  He was already 32.  So by the time we married I was 27, he was 35 and it seemed right.  I could not have married at 18 - I changed so much from then to 25.  I think you waiting 2 more years is the better decision.  If the love is real, the wait won't matter.
o1yy6KABaa	"Don't you think if your going to be in a long term loving relationship with someone you should trust them and give them the benefit of the doubt unless shown otherwise?" <br>  <br>  Yes i agree 100% on that part. There are just some people who either have no self esteem, or get incredibly bored and imagine that their partner might cheat, or is cheating. for some people it might be an easy way out if they arent happy in a relationship. Ive always beleived that if you dont trust someone 100% theres no point.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Lack of true trust, respect and friendship.<br>  <br>   Fear and insecurities.<br>  <br>  or my favorite- just being a plain 'ol crazy beeotch!|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	I think it is a matter of insecurity and mistrust.  Especially if you have been in a relationship before where your partner has cheated on you.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Sounds like a lack of trust. You have to develop that trust or you won't be able to survive.|`|u0eTvggDaa	yes i agree, we should give them the benefit of the doubt, why? because it's just fair.<br>  <br>  i believe most people are paranoid about these sorts of things cause, One it's happened to them, or Two they have seen it happen and think it will happen to them. Or it possibly could be they found out that they cheated before and then they think " Once a cheater, always a cheater" which isn't always the case.<br>  <br>  But being in a relationship i do think you should trust the person, until given a reason not to.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Because behavior changes in the relationship stir up questions, and 99% of the time they are right.<br>  Cheating is the new fad haven't you heard. Everyone's doing it. It's pretty disgusting if you ask me.|`|SIK58haraa	Every boyfriend I ever had cheated on me. I have now been married for 7 years and I don't think he's cheating but I always think there is a possibility he will.|`|79wOWoM0aa	Because a lot of them are.<br>  <br>  And yes people are insecure.  People just want to KNOW that it'll all be ok.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Because they are!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	Because its the easiest answer to every problem.  People don't seem to understand that not everyone thinks of cheating every second.  Sometimes there are other reasons why marriages are falling apart, lack of communication, lack of trust, lack of love, etc.  Its just that cheating is always the easiest answer to give.
JtEBaOdjaa	My fiance is the same. Well, he remembers but he never does much. This Vday, he took me to the restaurant across the street and we had BLT's (and that was only cause we didn't do groceries yet and had no food lol)  My gift to him last year: 4 day surprise vacation to Quebec City. I planned, I booked, I packed, I even snuck around with his boss(boy that sounds bad. lol) to get his shifts changed so he'd have the time off without knowing.<br>  Even the proposal was underwhelming.  We had JUST gone out for a nice dinner at a nice restaurant and a Blue Jays game (he knew i liked the idea of proposing at a restaurant or Jays game on the jumbotron) and when we got home I turned the TV on and started watching The Hills and THAT is when he proposed. lol wtf?  I'm not mad, but I mean, come on! lmao!<br>  Anyways, In the past 5 years I've learned, just don't expect much. lol. That sounds bad, but I mean, I don't need gifts and trips from him to know he loves me.  He shows me everyday (just like yours does: doing random sweet things, and helping around the house)|`|4POGapREaa	It never ceases to amaze me.  You have a great guy that helps out & is an all around jewel but you take the first opportunity you get to call him out for being an insensitive retard like you're almost waiting for him to fail.<br>  <br>  If you want to plan your life around Holidays as a measure of your commitment then go ahead but don't expect others to feel the same way.  Maybe I'm just not so much of a diva that I think the world should revolve around me & demand that people show their affection through gifts.  I don't get it.<br>  <br>  Be happy.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	OK you have to make a choice. Either you want the cards, little gifties and spontaneously romantic thoughts - or you want to marry this man. You said you've already spoken with him about this and HE is obviously not going to change. HE will always, always always expect you to tell him what he is giving you for whatever day you are celebrating. So either get used to it or get a new fiance. <br>  <br>  So, if you love him as you say, you'll either get used to telling him what you want and forgo the surprises - or don't marry him. You will end up a nagging witch and he will start resenting you. HE's not going to change.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	He is probably not that creative.  My husband usually buys my gifts the day of the occasion and usually I am with him.  Not a lot of thought, but that's just how he is.  For all you know, he might think that he is making a lot of effort.  He also might want to make sure you like what he is doing or getting-maybe he thinks he is being considerate.  It really is the thought behind the gift and since he did say something a week earlier you know that he was thinking about you.|`|R7b150Iyaa	You are totally justified in feeling the way you do.  I'd be bummed too.  Since you have already spoken about it before and he continues to disregard you, you have one of two options. 1) Sit him down calmly and quietly and tell him that it is VERY important to you to mark special occasions.  What is he going to do once you're married, ignore your anniversary then too?  Tell him that it hurts your feelings that you go above and beyond for him while he doesn't put forth the same effort.  Tell him it makes it seem as if he doesn't care about you as much as you care about him.  I really think he will understand, since he sounds like a good guy.<br>  2) Have a mutual friend/family member tell him point blank to his face that you were disappointed he didn't mark V-Day or your birthday with anything special.  He should definitely shape up then.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have a wonderful birthday!  =)|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	1.  Calm down.<br>  2.  You're expecting something for the wrong reason.  You expect him to do for you what you do for him. Doesn't work that way, he's not you.<br>  3.  He asked you what you want, write it down and give it to him so he can get it.<br>  4.  He loves you or he wouldn't be there with you.  He'd be out with someone else.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Well, it's very important that you are treated well all year long but I understand about those "special" days you would like commemorated.  My husband doesn't do anything about V-day, my BD, our anniversary, or Xmas.  When we were tight on $ we decided to not do anything but our financial situation is very different now and he still doesn't do anything for me.  Hwr, he doesn't buy great gifts when he does shop so at least I'm not stuck with a lot of stuff I don't like.  I'll just keep doing for him and try to not be too unhappy about not getting done for!|`|AA11065140	I can't say that you're in the wrong for thinking that way, but feeling bad about it won't solve the problem.  I'll tell you that marriage has taught me a very critical lesson...<br>  <br>  Men are not psychic!<br>  <br>  You really are going to have to tell him what you want, very specifically, if you want something specific.  If what you really want is for him to plan something, then say in plain English, "What I want for my birthday is for YOU to plan a weekend getaway for us."  Don't say you want to get away - say that you want him to plan it.  You have to be excruciatingly clear, because he really does not have the capability to guess what's going on inside your brain (really, he's a man, and you're a woman - there are clearly at least two different thought processes going on).<br>  <br>  Also...it has probably taken him the better part of 20 years to memorize his mother's birthday.  You should definitely not assume that he has memorized yours after just a few years of having you in his life.  This does not mean, in any sense, that you're not the most important person in his life - it simply means that he hasn't memorized the date yet (perhaps he never will).  You may have to say something like, "Now, don't forget that my birthday is in a few weeks.  I'm really looking forward to the weekend getaway that you're planning!"  <br>  <br>  The good news is that he values you enough to ask at the last minute.  Some just ignore it all together, so you're already doing better than a lot of women!  <br>  <br>  Also...you shouldn't compare what you give him, to what he gives you - it's not a contest!  Give because giving brings you joy, and for no other reason (this applies to every human and every event in your life, btw).  Accept what he gives as what he's capable of giving, and be happy that he cares enough to do it.<br>  <br>  In closing, I have to say this - get over it!  If he really is a super guy, and shows you that he cares on a regular basis, then count your blessings, and move on from this trivial personality quirk.  No one is perfect, and a good man is hard to find.  If this is his only failing, then you've found a keeper, and you should hold on tight!|`|QenW1Ok7aa	My husband once bought me a magazine at the grocery store because he saw the date and remembered 'Hey, it's our anniversary."<br>  <br>   Seriously. The best thing of all? That magazine was that old tabloid, 'The Sun'-wth?<br>  <br>   I still have it :) I saved it forever, because it makes me laugh hysterically that he thought this was an appropriate present. <br>  <br>   Some guys suck at holidays and presents. You can change them a bit, but your fiance is already doing wayyy better than a third of his fellow men. So you're going to have to learn not to take this personally, and just accept that he's DUMB about this :)|`|fyaMGF6zaa	sounds exactly like my boyfriend!! my birthday is also tomorrow! 2/21! and he kept telling me and my sister that he was gonna plan something but then last night he kept asking me what i wanted to do and he got my friends numbers out of my phone and asked them what we should do. he always lasts until the last min. and for valentines day he bought himself a new truck and only told me happy valentines day. i got nothing. i understand what you mean that its not about what you get...its just the thought. i guess i dont really have any advice because my boyfriend continues to do this to me and i say things to him all the time. i guess some guys just dont get it and its part of their personality. just remember that you love him and he loves you. ive started to just get things for myself from him. :] i got myself a new bed set for my birthday from him! :] good luck with tomorrow! happy early birthday! :]]
Uj5kuzoJaa	I don't understand why the first person to answer this was a woman lol.<br>  Anyways, My bf likes when I cook for him, let him watch tv, and just shut up lol. Then sex at the end of the night is always appreciated. It's the way to a mans heart|`|4HoVVCenaa	I like anything romantic.. once in a while. Candles at dinner. Flowers.. (yes, a girl can give a guy flowers).   But don't over do it.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	I'm engaged. I just want her to leave me alone.|`|CQnlxYk4aa	Honestly, Show up to his job (on lunch time) and let him that you just came by to tell him you really love him and your really Happy being with him. Pulse it wouldn't hurt to buy his favorite sandwich and hand it to him.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Guys like anything that results in sex.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	spooning or cuddling on the couch would be nice. not enough tender moments in life.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Depending on your age this will vary.Some of the guys that are more mature will appreciate romantic things, some may think that you are trying to trap them into marriage. So you need to qualify your audience before you scare them off or make them think that they are going to get laid. There are plenty of men that like to receive spontaneous gifts, kisses, have dinner bought for them, ETC. There are others that like to lay on the ground at night a look at the stars and share their thoughts and dreams with someone. Maybe a long romantic walk or just cuddling or necking would be better. The point I am trying to make is that you need to really know the guy and know what he is into to answer this question correctly. If you don.t he is going to get the wrong idea and you will feel defeated. Good luck.|`|J7k4xJtoaa	Depends on the guy, but everyone is right keep it simple. Make him or buy him his favorite food, a good drink if he has a favorite beer. If he is a sports guy watch the game with him, or watch the kind of movie he would love to watch. Basically the reverse of what women want, show him that you know what he likes and yes top it off with sex.. hey its win win you both get some|`|3QCpu8EAaa	guys are weird but it turns my husband on when i cook it makes him wild then i have to run it is so fuc..ing crazy mutch funn.|`|QkfGYIcxaa	well of course guys like sex.  but what else do guys like?      <br>  <br>  answer: FOOD  cook a nice romantic dinner, and have an evening alone with your man.  That would be great.|`|4iVel5Ymaa	Men like romance more than they let on! I think most things are romantic if its just the two of you.|`|DD3hrcq1aa	Just don't overdo things it gets annoying when you try to hard|`|RkzzBKxwaa	hmm,<br>  <br>  my gf sometimes brings me lunch when im working.<br>  :P|`|FzFSzilmaa	nope, just sex is fine... don't need romance.. that is for women!!! so that we can GET sex as a reward... :D|`|2qw6E7iCaa	Well you could take to see the football, or what ever he likes... and surprise him with that... or maybe buy something sexual for you to wear for him; i know you said no sexual references but it couldn't hurt.<br>  <br>  hope i've helped|`|8pWFsDSHaa	Cooking, or i really love it when my girlfriend just out of the blue gets supper happy and trys her hardest to do something special, even if it fails, its a nice attempt = )
xX7EnZsdaa	Depends on the guy.<br>  <br>  I'm kinda outgoing but whenever I'm around the girl I like i get kinda quiet. Whenever she talks i stop and listen to EVERYTHING she says.<br>  <br>  What I'm getting at is just look for "abnormal" behavior whenever hes near you.|`|ZZ6roUpxaa	an outgoing guy might joke around with you and play jokes on you. he might even be a major flirt. he would treat you nicely he could even be a major jerk there are many things that an outgoing guy can act depends on who he is and who you are but if he truly likes you then you will know it and things will work out and fall into place<br>  good luck hope we helped<br>  ~ashley and samantha|`|SLIIyjyRaa	He may act shy, when he is usually outgoing. It all depends on the guy actually.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Be loving and joke alot. Girls like guys that make them laugh. Also, be honest about your feelings and you'll go far.|`|2wSuadIhaa	i wish i knew! <br>  shy guys usually do not talk to girls! <br>  and outgoing guys talk to everyone!|`|sxJgu3C9aa	A guy who likes/loves a girl expresses, manifests his feelings directly to the girl, whether he is an outgoing or not.<br>  <br>  LOVE is all that matters that moment, it becomes the priority .<br>  Heart is stronger than any other...activity.|`|7awb0wgWaa	dunno.. never had that luck:(
P0Fjh59Eaa	LOL <br>  <br>  uh...NO. hell for his birthday a few years ago i got him and his friends VIP passes to a very "up scale" club. They had fun, and he came home to ME....what's the big damn deal? they got him all excited for me, i didn't have to do anything! ha ha<br>  <br>  Lucy- i imagine that would be true if my husband was a thoughless prick. Ya know sometimes there truly are couples that are not jealous of each other or silly little outing w/the guys. how sad that you need to tear down like that on what i've said, considering you don't know the first thing about my marriage and all. but you think w/e you want if it makes you feel better, i'm not that insecure about it as you are. lol|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I wouldn't.  I don't generally care about those types of places as long as it's not an everyday type of thing.  I'm going with my girlfriends, so as long as he doesn't get mad at me, I won't get mad at him!|`|IvMPh09baa	not angry... I'd be LIVID!|`|TdEdW8tSaa	dont have a bf at the moment but i honestly wouldnt care just like i would care if he watched porn|`|TPN1yIj7aa	probably more for the fact that its money he should be spending on ME|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	No.  I've even gone with him.  What's the big deal?|`|OHfZFR31aa	Not really. I've been to a few stripclubs myself. If he was spending every week there and spending hundreds then I'd be upset. But if it was a one-time thing it wouldn't bother me.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Not so much angry, but finally confident in the fact that I am indeed superior to him.<br>  <br>  ADD:  And the concept of women going to strip clubs in an effort to be the "cool" girlfriend so she can sit there and feel superior to a woman who has hit rock bottom is so sad, it borders on tragic.  Show a little solidarity.  Strippers are mostly drug addicts, rape/incest victims and/or supporting children the only way they know how.  They deserve our sympathy, not our smug righteousness.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	i would be mad as hell,hes life wouldn't be worth living|`|gfHutvEFaa	don't you like how women have been programed to "turn the other check" or agree with "boys will be boys" "men are visual". Get effing real! Everyone is different, but I feel it is crapping on your wife/girlfriend, saying we aren't good enough or they are hotter or whatever. My husband doesn't go, but i honestly would be *issed if he did. I think it is cheating. He thinks chatting online (sexually), texting sexually etc, is cheating, so I don't do that. <br>  <br>  Respect each other in your relationship.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Nope if you trust them ..whats the big deal.<br>  <br>  Men will look at other women, whether its iin the street, magazines, or strip clubs, long as hes only looking, dont see the problem|`|f6YsGOynaa	Nope.. he's on a skiing trip with his buddies, and I'm sure they are going to one tonight.  If he were local and went without inviting me, I'd be ticked.|`|AA11011446	Yeah i'd be angry and want to know why he felt the need to do that.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Yes, but only because he'd be pissed if the shoe was on the other foot.|`|AA11706291	Only if he hadn't warned me before he was going.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I'd kick his backside.|`|F8iYNurEaa	Yes, although it depends on the circumstances. If it were a stag party then I would tolerate it. Any other time is unacceptable. I have the will power not to pay a man to take his clothes off for me, and men should be no different. The women who say "boys will be boys" or similar BS are making excuses for their husband's disrespectful behaviour and are trying to convince themselves that they have a happy marriage when actually their husbands would prefer to look at another woman naked than look at their own wives!<br>  <br>  The reasons I would be angry/disappointed are:<br>  <br>  1) It is a complete waste of money. If he wants to thrown money away on nothing then he can throw it my way instead and fund my shoe collection. <br>  <br>  2) Why is paying someone in a strip club to take their clothes off any different than paying a strange woman in a bar/club to take their clothes off? <br>  <br>  3) By paying someone to strip is basically saying that your wife/girlfriend does not satisfy you enough.<br>  <br>  Finally, the women who say they don't care, or that they want to go too, are just trying to be cool so that their husband/boyfriend will brag about their "cool" girlfriend to their friends. It is soooo try hard.<br>  <br>  Well done to Lucy and Lucy for saying it how it is.|`|GoABmevnaa	I wouldn't care too much. Because if I was curious and wanted to go to a strip club with men on the dance floor, I would want to go without him being upset. You should just make light of the situation and laugh about it and simply tell him you'll go with him next time. It could be something yall will laugh about and enjoy together.  Girl, at the end of the day he's going home with you, not that slutty girls on the pole.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	yes i would be angry if they have to go and watch that to get their kicks instead of being happy with wot they got then be single and they not hurting anyone.and the one who said he came home ready for it and she didnt have to do anything thats the whole point the tarts got him fired up and he used you to release it go girl i would sure be happy that my hubby was banging me while thinking of a stripper|`|bDoJuBEkaa	No, not unless he spent alot of money|`|i1rDJY2aaa	I am a former exotic dancer. My formal title was "Entertainer", which is what we do - entertain. I did not have sex or give blow jobs in the VIP room, go home with ANY customers, and I NEVER did drugs.<br>  <br>  All of you narrow minded ladies making your false assumptions and your rude comments are completely wrong and have a very narrow mentality.<br>  <br>  I am also a single Mom by the way, as most of my coworkers were - some were college students as well. We go to work, do our job, and go home to our kids at the end of the day - just like you do.|`|TPhIWWniaa	No, I wouldn't be mad at all! After all he'd be coming home to me.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No, I"ve been there done that...it's not a big deal in my book.|`|uec7RIhbaa	not really.  i get that women are annoyed with the whole letching, leering and lap dancing thing but it doesn't bother me.  i always tease my husband that he DOESNT go to these places and doesn't find strippers ("you can't TOUCH them!  how is that sexy?!  it's just teasing") and stuff a good night out!!|`|7yFWxvv3aa	Most definately!!!! I have already expressed this to him and he completely agrees that he would never.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Not unless he was making a habit of it. Every once in awhile is fine but like a couple times a week or once a week I would but really upset.|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	Not really, as long as he did not do anything with the girls.|`|CuWjsHM2aa	Yes. I would be angry.|`|NGKwsawdaa	I don't mind him going to one as long as I'm invited.<br>  <br>  but he's not into stripclubs so I never have to worry about that.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Nope wouldnt bother me at all.|`|79wOWoM0aa	My wife doesn't care, but she's not you.|`|U2tx9gDHaa	No, boys will be boys.|`|AA10509805	It doesn't matter if anyone else would be mad at their partner. What matters is if YOU are mad at yours. <br>  If you have a problem with him going to strip clubs, it's up to you to discuss that with him. If he continues to go despite it upsetting you, then you have to decide if it's important enough to leave him. <br>  <br>  Personally, I have no problem with it.

AA10408380	Yes I did. When we got married, I thought he was SO cute. I mean, not hot by any means, but he was the cutest guy I ever met. It was more his mannerisms than his looks, but he was a bit easy on the eyes too. The perfect level of cuteness to make me feel secure with him. But after our honeymoon, I came back to the US. We got married in India. Well, we started going through  a rough patch, so I went back to be with him. He let himself go pretty quickly! I was putting my ears up to his belly and feeling for movement! I even told his parents...no matter what it is, it aint mine!<br>  <br>  You get the picture. His face got a bit bulgy too. "And I was like, whoa, u were pudgy when we met, but u looked good, now u just look icky(in my mind). And at night, I'd always mutter, u better be glad I love u. Plus, I knew when he came to the states, he'd just get fatter. But it was no use telling him, because it's a good thing to be fat in india, shows ppl u aint poor, since u got good eats. I didn't marry him on looks either. In fact, when his attitude changed so did our relationship. I could've put up with a fat guy, but a fat A$$, no thanks. But  I'd tell him, that if there ever came a time I couldn't put my arms around u, u'd haVe to loose weight. that time would've come soon. There were times I'd be with him and imagine the guy I married n not the guy I was with. The only difference between the two was the MASSIVE pudgy. <br>  <br>  Don't feel bad, I'm sure there are many women out there who feel exactly the same way u do. that's when u know u really do love ur man.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	When I first met my husband, I wasn't necessarily attracted to him.

Maybe he is scared to death and because the man is usually the bread winner  and now he isn't. I have been in your place and I was doing everything and we just decided we were better off without each other.It is difficult when they don't want to talk , mine use to shut me out the same way. I loved him with all my heart but I just couldn't take it I felt like we were married in name only and I finally told him that and he agreed!!!!! So yes it will hurt and it will hurt like hell but you sound strong enough that you could cope on your own and your child will be better off also. I had three little one's when I made that decision and he said I was taking  his children away from him and he broke down and cried but he still didn't change he was never there. So I walked with my children and we were better off because of it. Do it now and believe me you will remain friends because of the child but at the same time you will have your sanity back. Us women are alot stronger than men give us credit for, yes there will be lonely days but you will heal and your child will be the one to get you thru it. Everything you went thru is my story so listen to somebody who has been there. Plus you will probably find somebody who will care about you and love you and help you one of these days I did and what a wonderful life I had to be in love again and have a feeling that this person was there for me and my children 100% was amazing..

Now what I mean is dont botter asking him how his day went or what he is feeling for atleast two weeks, additionally try to give him some space. I know that right now it should be the other way around and you should be the one that gets pampered and getting attention but you say you dont want to loose him so make a sacrifice and ignore him. sometimes we men tend to get annoy by the smallest reasons but later we realize that we were wrong and sometimes its too late. his attitude towards you is that he is scared, I mean both of you got togheter at a very young age and know he sees that there is still much out there and maybe some of his friends are going out and meeting new people and he cant because he has a wifey at home.|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	well i know its hard but see if you can relax him in any way i bet your just as stressed out as he is. times liek this are very bad. but thats why it makes us stronger when we overcome it. if you notice sings that he may be cheating or whatever the case is. see if you can establish a time to speak to him amyeb a day when hes off of work. if he feels uncomfortable about speaking about it there may be a problem.overall you are both going though some bad times and if he is going through this often it means that he doesnt know what to do anymore. plz im not somone to tell you what to do. all i can tell you this is from my expericance and very often im not wrong i see this all the itme because im latin american and our race....these things happen very often....such as my father....my mother went through the same thing but worst...they had been fighting for about 15 years. now finally thank you god i love you its over. our family has now been close than ever|`|feCwNu9Yaa	I'm only 13 but i really hope this helps.

He's either an alcoholic, unhappy being married, or found something interesting in that bar that captured his attention. What you need to do is this. Get a babysitter, Go up to that freakin bar, make sure you are looking your best, and walk in and see what's going on. Sit down next to him, order yourself a drink . You don't have to drink it.( You are proving a point here.) Tell him in no uncertain terms that if this bar is more important than your wife or child, then, you can marry it. Take a swig of the drink, set it down, and tip the bartender. Leave. And you need to do so walking out with your head held high. Now, the ball is in his court. You will get his decision soon enough. He'll either come home where he belongs, or continue to stay at the bar. If he chooses the bar, then get an attorney. You have a baby to take care. You don't have time for these selfish antics of your husband's. Love him or not. Do not put up with this crap. Because he will continue to do this if you let him. You deserve better.

I know you said you were living paycheck to paycheck, but depending on what sort of area you live, there may be free groups, or church counseling. I would suggest checking your local yellow pages or going online. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like your husband is feeling the strain of marrying so young and now having a child to support. The way you have put it, his behavior sounds like he's trying to recapture his youth...the days when he could go have drinks with the guys and not have to worry about what time he got home. You are completely within your rights to be worried about this though. You guys have a young daughter, and you need his support. <br>  <br>  Like, I said, counseling seems like a good idea. If you really love your husband, sit him down and tell him how you feel about this. Be calm, don't nag, and tell him that you either need him to be with you in this, or you guys are going to have to work something else out.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.

As a self respecting man, as hopefully he is, he probably has a hard time dealing with the fact that he's making less money all of a sudden and that his wife is now the bread winner. Even if you are not throwing it in his face he can't help but to feel like you are.  Kind of like how no matter how much a man tells his wife he thinks she's beautiful she can't help but to think that he just doesn't want to hurt her feelings by telling her she's fat.  Whether she is or not, and whether he makes her feel that way or not, she can't help but to think that way.  Example:  if he's making the money and you ask him, "honey will you take out the trash?"  he hears, "hey, love, you big strong man will please help little ol me and take out this trash you manly man?"  If he's not making the money anymore he can't help but to fell like you're saying, "hey, since you don't do sh*t all day you better at least take out the trash."  Since the problems started around the time when he started making less that is probably all it's about.  However every little thing will be about that and next thing he hears is, "when the hell are you coming home" meaning since you make the money you're in charge and can set a curfew for a grown man.  Even if what you mean is, "honey I miss you and would like to spend some time with you."  So I'll close with this: if this small thing in you marrige is really something that you're considering throwing in the towel for then you shouldn't have gotten married in the first place.  Because when the economy changes for the better (regardless of how long it takes) he'll make more money again and slowly but surely you'll notice that he's less irritable.  For better or worse means just that.  So if you reall love him try to see things from his point of view and don't give up.  I mean hell, he's not cheating on or beating you.  So it's not really all that bad, is it?|`|AA11142539	Sounds like you have some problems to work out.  I don't think this forum is necessarily the right place, though.  Most of the advice people will give you here is not going to be conducive to maintaining a healthy relationship; there's just no investment involved.<br>  <br>  If he feels like you're trying to control him, maybe you should try to be a bit more conscious of what you're saying or how you're saying it?  The words may be innocuous, but your timing or inflection may be conveying an expectation from him that he's trying to purposely ignore.<br>  <br>  The fact that you are making more money than him may make him feel emasculated, or worse it could make him feel unneeded or impotent, and your continued presence doing "what you should be doing" is rubbing his inadequacy in his face.  The implication is the breadwinner is the head of the household; in a reversal from the traditional gender roles, he could feel that your requests and/ or suggestions are more like commands, and that could be a source of irritation.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there's not going to be a lot you can do about this.  One option is directly confronting him, and assert yourself as the head of the household and tell him to get his butt in line or get the heck out... obviously this is a high-risk scenario, but if it works, you may end up with a husband that has been jerked back to reality.<br>  <br>  Another way to go is to shut up and take it.  Don't ask him where he's going or when he's coming back, don't depend on him for anything.  This will be much harder, and also invite him to take you for granted, but it also has the possibility of jerking him back to reality.  <br>  <br>  No matter how you look at this, it really sounds like things will likely get worse before they get better.  Try to weather the storm, let him know you're angry at him, but don't try to punish him.  Maybe he'll get over this funk.<br>  <br>  Hope it works out.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	He's depressed because of your finances and his work condition. When he goes out with his buddies then he gets to forget about these problems and when he's home, you and his daughter are a reminder he could be a better provider. <br>  <br>  Men are very touchy when it comes to financial problems. My suggestion to you is to let him be for a while. Just smile, cook his favorite meal, offer to do things he likes like renting a movie he meant to see, have a beer together on your back porch. Don't talk about it, don't ask him to confine in you, don't try to get in his head. Men want to solve their problems on their own, asking your help would be a sign of weakness to his eyes.|`|SovaFpN8aa	I think he feels worthless because he is having trouble supporting his family. He is afraid you will think less of him as a man, and afraid you will stop loving him. He feels helpless because he thinks he should be able to solve your financial problems, but he can't. He subconsciously resents the fact that you are bringing home more money than he is. His real problem is he is immature, and way too proud. He wants to show you that you can't control him, because he feels not in control of his own life. Talk to your preacher or a counselor, both of you need an objective opinion on your relationship. Good Luck!|`|dbXnW5emaa	OK, so it looks like you got married when you were 18.  That's young, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...you've been together for 8 years, so there must be something there.  <br>  <br>  He sounds a bit immature.  But the last thing an immature person wants to hear is that they are immature.  I'm not saying you're calling him immature, but you're reminding him he is by the way you mention he should be carrying his weight around the house.  I agree with you, but an immature person doesn't want to hear that kind of stuff.<br>  <br>  If you really love him, and if he really loves you I'd say hang in there with him for a while.  He may grow out of it.  But if his "hanging with his buddies" gets to be more of a problem then you need to confront him with it.  He needs to realize he has a family to support and help take care of.  Watching the baby when he's not working is definitely a way to both save money and pull his weight.  Lord knows I did my share of it.<br>  <br>  I know it's rough right now, but my advice is to try to hang on as long as you can before you take any drastic measures.  I absolutely recommend church.  A family that goes to church together is a better family.  Good luck, and you'll be in my prayers.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	You are definitely putting up with a load of crap. I feel for your family and especially you. He needs to MAN UP when he is not able to actually earn a paycheck and be supporting the family in other constructive ways vice hanging out and drinking beer.<br>  <br>  I'm depressed over the economy also, but it doesn't make me hangout and drink beer to drown my sorrows.
Tm2qa99gaa	yes. agree with u on this..we always miss something in our life...<br>  but who said you dont  have mate.. Im always here for u if u need to talk.. or.........  smile...|`|vUypopU8aa	yes! thats how i feel right now<br>  great friends great family great grades great clothes <br>  but no boyfriend .. sigh
Tm2qa99gaa	yes.. baby.. I love to keep myself happy.. all the time...right now.. you make me  happy online..<br>  and u..??|`|NpzNHmCGaa	Generally when its a Friday I feel happier. However to what extent depends on my plans for the weekend etc.|`|jK8xy3VUaa	I'm not always happy, but I try to be. And yes. T.G.I.F!!!!!|`|vUypopU8aa	no, sometimes its sad|`|RGcXgjEDaa	about 99% of the time.  There is that one friday a year that always screws me up
5r2Csdzwaa	Sounds more like the DOLT is bi and into Orgies!|`|nqkXE1cUaa	This is bad.|`|AA10408380	Ok, y do u and ur spouse both have bf's?(boyfriends?). Or do u mean best friends(bf?). In either case, no one except u and ur spouse should be playing strip poker, and it should be alone. But hey, that's just me, whatever floats ur boat. I'd wonder y u'd want to include anyone else in the game. Is it cheating? To me it would be, but then, as soon as my guy wanted to invite other ppl to STRIP poker, I'd call him a cheater. But ur already playing the game with full consent, so just because it makes u feel uncomfortable it's cheating? The definition of that word depends on how u want to define it for urself.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I don't think I would necessarily consider it cheating, but it is unacceptable.  I would not be happy if my husband did that.   <br>  <br>  Either way, if you find it unacceptable even, then there is a problem.  You both need to sit down and discuss what is acceptable, and what isn't so something of this nature doesn't happen again.|`|Kg5KX432aa	that is completely 100% unacceptable. Whether you feel it's technical "cheating" or not (everbody has their own defitinion), I really don't personally know anybody who would think that's an okay activity for a married man|`|OBCvewW2aa	You know what I consider cheating?  Acting like you own your spouse.  It's cheating your spouse out of pure love.|`|egpVC6uMaa	If you are uncomfortable with it and she still does it, then yes it is cheating...if she did it without knowing that you were uncomfortable with it, it is still inappropriate behavior from a married woman but one that is more out of error or ignorance.<br>  <br>  Let her know that this behavior bothers you and is something that you don't want her to repeat, in the future. Be specific about the fact that you are uncomfortable with it. If she does it again, then it will be considered intentional cheating on her part...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Cheating, no. distasteful and juvenile behavior for adults, yes. though i doubt you are the only one..i do think you need to loosen up!|`|79wOWoM0aa	If you need to hide it or lie about it, it's cheating.<br>  <br>  If you could tell your sig other without a problem, it's not cheating.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	it's not exceptable in marriage.  now that you know that, what are you going to do about it?|`|SovaFpN8aa	I am confused. Are you asking if it is cheating if your boyfriend, your husband and someone else's boyfriend were playing strip poker?|`|4gkepThIaa	it's cheating|`|1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	You are so right, it is unacceptable. bf they are not.|`|AA10240683	My opinion is, no.|`|UCq7SjsRaa	It depends on the dynamic of the friendship that you spouse had with the other two. If they all just took they're clothes off during strip poker because they were maybe a bit drunk and having a laugh, then no. (also if your spouse told you about it) If it was anything else than I would say that was cheating.|`|goY0JHzlaa	I think I would personally have a problem with this. He would be in big trouble when I got home. ANd, I wouldn't be getting over it in any kind of fast way. There's just certain lines you don't cross once you are in a committed relationship such as marriage.|`|th7C1aoaaa	If i was out of town and my wife played strip poker with other people. It's cheating. I would come home and ask her if she won a new house while playing. Then I would inform her that if she didn't, she needs to find another one because she'd be out.|`|6GIu3Hhvaa	erm i dunno reli i wud be bothered but not sure if it reli wrong if its just harmless fun, did he tell you or did he hide this from you if he told you i think he may have been confident that it was just fun and a laff and there was nothing else to it.|`|NlxmeCWDaa	It's not cheating, but it is deceptive.  If people are doing this than they are most likely doing more.  So strip poker would probably be the appetizer to the meal of group swap.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I don't know if both married people were in the room, and no one did anything, and they both were ok with it, who cares. People like strange things.|`|abf1bb619e33219626c5a51afbf513daaa	Yep!<br>  <br>  In a relationship you just don't do that unless it was previously agreed upon between the BOTH of you|`|R1vvH4aKaa	Do you know the meaning of the word Cuckold!|`|XnPnfFxPaa	yes it is.  the s**t would hit the fan if my man did that
mtzJXhIjaa	i had a similar situation and it was akward. i kinda just told him i liked someone else, because i am a people pleaser and hate hurting peopels feelings, but i wasn't attacted to him. i would tell him thanks but no thanks, because if he is rude and obnoxious it doesn't matter about skin color!|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I don't care if he is purple, if he's rude - just say No.  If he makes it race thing, than it is his problem not yours.  Don't even mention this race thing to your friends.  The more you talk about it, the more it will be true.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	same thing over here girl! lol<br>  yeah it was really hard to say no! lol<br>  i didnt want him to think it wa for his skin color! lol<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Amzy52i8xe6JqXuvop4SX_Tsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220134114AAgQY0T">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Just said NO... if he thinks this or that .. there's nothing you can do about it!|`|xOX7yMczaa	lol i totally agree with 'nickyvegas' but just be like im not looking to date right now, sorry. :) id be afraid hed be all mad n stuff. ..oops that probly didnt help you. but watch out for it.. if he does get mad, dont get mad back, keep your cell phone on you. annnd try to sneak yourself completely away from him..good luck! <3|`|A2bG6BjRaa	Say:<br>  <br>  "Sorry, but no, because you're really rude to people and can get on my nerves, and I don't want to date someone like that."|`|na2axA4taa	dont be so stupid the world dont revolve around colour.<br>  ill google it then get back to you in a min as i want to give you the best answer i can<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x|`|wXV5GxJHaa	well i would say no to a black guy too just because i only dont find black guys attractive, it's not racist. it's just what you look. who cares what he thinks|`|FzFSzilmaa	just say "NO"... doesn't need explanation...|`|dwLqreuvaa	Tell him you won't go out with him because hes rude and abnoxious|`|Un9CElCaaa	i would i cant stand white girls that like black guys. black people think everything is racist. its really annoying|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Eh! why would he think that? it's you making as issue out of it not him.

This is unavoidable.|`|5oFP3z8Qaa	tell him you have an internet boyfriend and he'll think you're a creep and leave you alone.|`|RkzzBKxwaa	RaCiSt D:|`|QXoeJqD8aa	well tell him that sorry i only treat you as a friend, i dont see anything further between us if we ever involve in a relationship.....|`|fPWiNzuQaa	Use the reasons you just put posted here.

swwxrBe7aa	kick him where it hurts everytime he says it he wont be able to do anything back because he will be rolling on the ground grabbing himself.....then while he's doing that laugh and point at him. you probably shouldnt do this in front of your parents because you could get in trouble but after a few kicks in the baby maker he may stop calling you fat|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Ignore him. If he starts talking, walk away.|`|Od4v2a8Baa	Well I was going to say something immature and my girlfriend convinced me not to say it. She was sitting on my lap when I was typing it and she says, "Jason, don't say that it just sounds stupid. Soooo... I'm out of ideas.. I don't know what to say that is mature.  I guess the mature thing to do would just be to walk away and ignore him.  If you call him a name back, as tempting as it sounds, it will only provoke him and cause more drama for you.  So I guess just do the mature thing and good luck!|`|wy5SiCS2aa	well 4 cheez its my gosh that's nothing to get so upset over. It's pretty selfish of you to ask your mom to buy something just for you, why don't you just share. But when your brother calls you names that's not cool either. Just say "you're just jealous because you wish you was hot like me." or something like that.|`|AuWPMH44aa	hes just messing wit u. if any1 saw u eatin a whole box of cheez its they wuld be like damn ur fat. but hes just messing wit u. just call him something else.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	say:<br>  <br>  well, i could easily lose weight but you'll always be ugly|`|mD0mgnPxaa	ok well here's what i do when my guy friend jokingly call me that, it should work for brothers too. next time he says that.. smile and say "well if you really think my *** is fat, why do u continue to call me that. you cant tell my *** is fat unless you look there :]" then just walk away. and if he says i wudnt wanna look there just say "wrong.. evryone does." and turn around [[slap ur butt if u want to tell him to kiss yo a**]] and walk away and ignore him. thats what i do... works everytime.|`|KaZTg0Plaa	he just knows how to make you upset.  i know this sounds weird but it works:  next time, give him no reaction whatsoever.  shrug you shoulders and say nothing.  this will make him lose his enthusiasm over screwing you around.  he wants your reaction not the food.<br>  <br>  trust me; try it.  may take a couple of times but it will work.|`|JUEkTETAaa	do not let it bother u ...as long as u know who u are and how u feel  do not worry ...he just has nothing better to do but see you u will react to what he said|`|Wd1vUx3Vaa	if he says that , then just say you ******* incestous bastard, quit looking at my ***, i don't do sister-brother sex|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Tell him it must be genetic.|`|nHlXQuTsaa	Throw the crackers at him|`|vvVrbB4Daa	tell him he doesnt look any better.|`|OPjTfhqmaa	just say " at least i can lose weight but you will always be an ugly fuc*er"|`|CjUycEDlaa	my friend has the same problem.. every time he says something like that she just freaks out and screams at the top of her lungs her mom then comes in and she is so mad at my friend for screaming like that she completely ignores the reason for donig so<br>  my advice to her was that she should go to her mom without the screaming then he will get in trouble and she will not be in trouble for screaming
eVK2zZsOaa	You have only been with him for four months so it shouldn't hurt him to bad. Go with your heart, don't be with this guy if you don't want to be. He will eventually notice that you aren't fully with him anyway. If the guy you like, likes you back just break it to your current boyfriend gently. Tell him that you would like to remain friends but it isn't going to work out. Once you start talking to this other guy be discreet about it and don't come right out and starting dating him because it won't look good. You are young, don't be tied down to somebody you don't want to be, dump him and get with the one you like.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	That's an easy one! date both! Keep your current one as the "official" but start your "offensive" against this new guy! ;D|`|JV0i77uiaa	Just go with this other guy to see how you feel.  You are only dating this other guy for four months.  I was in that situation once, I was going with someone for a long time and I was very confused.  The guy I was dating was very nice, however I stopped linking him, I like him as a brother and I was afraid to hurt him since the three of us work together.  The new guy that I really liked left the State and I still thinking of him.  When the guy that I was going with found out that the other guy found a girlfriend he came and dumped me out of the blue, that made feel real bad,  I want to be faithful to my old and look what happened.  Since you are not married to any of them you have the right to go with whomever you want.  Sometime you ended with any of them, but that's ok.  If you like this other guy at work that's telling me that you are not so much in love with the guy that you are going for four months.  The last question is does this other guy that you like, like you or ask you out?  Please let us know, I hope the best for you and God bless you and guide you.  (sorry this too long)|`|236c93851f8140793a37dd76c210a733aa	Does the other guy give you signs he likes you?|`|5jfjv7Hnaa	okay, well wich boy makes you happier?|`|QUFAKk1paa	sleep with both of them and choose who is better then|`|zhq5sW4laa	You're young, you dont have to settle on any one guy right  now you;re not married and you didnt agree to marry him so you can date whom ever you choose. but also know that there is not always someone better out there and sometimes it is better to stick with what you've got. If somethhing was going wrong in the relationship i could see leaving but not just because  the grass looks greaner. but anyway do what your heart tells you to do....... good luck|`|bvleoevoaa	does the other guy like you... figure it out...but dont let the other boy go... you need to really think about this. maybe you should break up with him and say you cant really do a relationship right now but you still like him and want to hang out with him...go on dates with both of them and choose from there...<br>  i was in this  before.|`|8fEeyNMeaa	Do you really like the other guy??

1UiYpUWiaa	this seems like a too big of a subject for the this site but ill try my best to give you at least something you can use and understand.<br>  right now your emotions are your enemy, anything that makes you feel bad is pointless and unnecessary, even if everybody around you is going crazy from their emotions(screaming, crying,getting angry) that doesn't mean you should care or try to fight them, when people feel bad they try to make you feel bad, its like they are trying to pick a fight that you won't win, ignoring that and cutting yourself from  their bad feelings is how you  win.<br>  its a shame about the divorce but you still have your parents even if they're not together and if you give it a chance im sure you can find a way to still have both of them be a part of your life.<br>  sorry to hear about your dog , losing a pet is always bad, take your time with your grief its quite alright.<br>  being anorexic is quite common among girls and also over eating , try to avoid food and drinks with chemicals especially the diet drinks, they mess with your head and make you feel more depressed (i know from experience),<br>  eat more healthy and don't feel bad about fat, having curves is beautiful, its all about balance, not too skinny not to fat find the balance.<br>  don't worry about your grades, grades aren't everything, school isn't everything , getting bad grades in school is not as serious as parents and teachers make you believe, i have yet to go to one job where they asked me for my old report cards, even if you don't get great grades this whole year don't  think that it means anything, take the time and get your life better then worry about school.<br>  stand up for yourself and don't let your parents push you around or take your stuff , i had to go trough many fights with my parents but im glad i did, it made us better people and it made them understand me and life better.|`|AA11724083	I think you should tell your mum all whats been happening i know its hard but shell probably understand more tell her about you cutting yourself and telling her all your worries will eventually go things cant get any worse they can only get better so try to pull yourself threw this even u cant tell your mum tell someone from your family your dad even or your closest Friend :)|`|jK8xy3VUaa	In life it is always darkest before the dawn. Things may be bad for you now, but it will clear up, and the sun will shine through. Try to look on everything that is good. Grades you can always make up. Boyfriends come and go. Parents down see through your eyes, so they may not fully understand. Pets help, though they may pass away, they had you, and vice versa. Look on the bright side. You can be happier this way. Hope this helps and good luck :) :) :)|`|vGLIF0THaa	Just look at the good things. I'm a huge pessimist and I get really upset whenever I think of all the sucky things in my life, ha. That probably sounds really dumb but it always helps me. And my family is the worst. It's so messed up. My parents sound a lot like yours, especially my mom. Just wait for things to get better, it'll all work out eventually. I'm sure theirs some reason for all this happening. [:
mbvpWNMeaa	It does sound a little pushy, but at least try it.  What she really wants is for you to get along with her boyfriend and she is trying to hard to find something for you an he to do together.  Best of luck.|`|AuWPMH44aa	no just tell her that u dnt want to. she prob just wants u to get to know her b/f so try to find something else that u both like so u can get to know him.|`|BfmpAnDQaa	Whats wrong with karate? It is awesome!|`|JUEkTETAaa	no she should not..just talk to her and let her know how u feel ...if that does not work out then keep in mind a female loves a guy who can protect her|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Tell him he is wasting his time because youre not at all interested in it. If you arent interested you wont be trying or succeed at it. Convince him he is wasting his time and maybe he will tell your mother to back off. When you talk to him do it with respect even though you dont like him. If you want help with this he is the one to get through to and it wont happen if you dont show respect.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	You should at least try it once and if you really don't want to continue then tell her, I'm sure she'll be glad that you at least gave it a shot.
P0Fjh59Eaa	LOL well my hubs is a big enough boy that he can make his own lunches. he's not 5! i do however make lunch for my kiddos. <br>  <br>  my hubs usually comes home for lunch, but when he can't he eats at the chow hall where it's nice and cheap (military)|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I would not make him anymore lunches - clearly, he is determined to go out for lunch and spend money.  I say cut way back on groceries.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I have the same problem with my 5 year old.  Luckily, he doesn't have access to my money so he can't p!ss it away.  Perhaps you should consider doing the same with your child, excuse me, husband.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	I've forgotten stuff like that too. My son has forgotten to take his lunch. <br>  <br>  He nearly walked out yesterday without the carefully packed lunch that HE packed (he's a teen) AND his class was going on a field trip so no food - had I not reminded him! <br>  <br>  So make him lunch again but put a note on his dashboard to remember to grab them out of the fridge before he hits the road.|`|dprURFLxaa	Maybe he just forgot.  Lighten up he's not a child.|`|81wvN8Rraa	What if he honestly forgot them? I would try it again but if it became a pattern I would stop,|`|goY0JHzlaa	I'd be sitting down and having a heart to heart with him. It could have been that he honestly forgot them while trying to get out the door and on the road. Next time, get up and hand them to him when he's walking out the door, or pack them and put them in his truck, vehicle, etc in a little cooler so that they are already there. Sounds like the guy didn't do it on purpose.|`|AA10509805	I wouldn't make my husband lunch unless he politely asked me to. He's a grown man and fully capable of making his own meals.|`|874EAxkfaa	if you want to drive your car in the rain,do you think it needs fuel? if he earns the bread, he can pick his own fuel!|`|M1u6fdZCaa	I would just remind him not to forget his lunch next time.|`|th7C1aoaaa	Why did they go to waste? Couldn't you have eaten them? Though I would be a little pissed.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Stop making them. He isn't worried about wasting the money either should you.
IVy35SE2aa	Perhaps the side of you that you are describing is known only<br>  to you because you hide it quite successfully, so far.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you really are a good person but you are<br>  putting yourself down because you feel that you haven't lived<br>  up to some elusive standard of perfection.<br>  <br>  Put your novels aside for a while and read a few books on how to<br>  raise your self esteem.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	Ur picture is really nasty. I don't think ur allowed to have that type of pic on here.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	what? your question makes no sense. Everyone has bad moods, you can't be all nice all the time, who wants that it's boring. You sound normal to me.
jNYfWerbaa	There isn't anything wrong with being single at thirteen years old. Why do you feel so desperate? I didn't have my first relationship until sixteen.

She's totally defensiveless.<br>  <br>  You need to rethink this.|`|0SQou2X9aa	it means you need to get running shoes!!!|`|AA10408380	Actions speak louder than words. His ex pissed him off, he didn't love her anymore, so he was a sh*thead to her. His kids are supposed to piss him off, but that gives him no right to light his short fuse. But he probably likes u and u probably make him feel great, and ha vent angered him just yet. Wait 'til u do, then u'll hear the vulgarity out of his mouth and his excuses when he sees u walk away from him. He's not a nice guy. He's a selfish jerk and only thinks about himself. If u stay with him, ur gonna have to walk on eggshells all ur life to please him. Apparently he thinks he's god's gift to mankind or something or he wouldn't be acting this way. Oh, maybe it's an inferiority complex, because from what u say, he's picking on the frail and old(women and his father).<br>  <br>  These are warning signs of abuse. After a while, those harsh words will turn to physical violence if everyone's not careful. He seems like a guy who knows how to hurt ppl with words, and even possibly deeds. So he's in control of what he says and does, since he knows how to use his words to hurt others. If he hurts others and his reasoning is because they hurt me, then it won't be long 'til he hurts u to. Get away from him fast, or whatever self esteem u have will be gone. Ever asked his ex y they split? I bet his temper was one reason.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4kfljeIGaa	Wow.  Some of the best advice I ever heard was "never date anyone who's rude to waiter or waitress," but this?  Sooner or later you WILL become his target, count on it!  <br>  <br>  Please don't think I'm rude, but most likely the only reason why he's nice to you now is because he wants to get with you.  Once he's secure in knowing that you're his girlfriend, your ears will start ringing with verbal abuse!  <br>  <br>  Again, I'm not trying to be harsh, but it sounds like you deserve better than this guy!|`|NGKwsawdaa	just give it time, he's going to start taking things out on you too.

d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	I can understand why u feel upset at that moment of time. It's normal to express ur anger, but you shld not hv use rough words on him. It's like a disrespect for a person even tho i know u don't mean it. Try to hold your temper.<br>  <br>  I think you shld express apology to him & be precise, telling him that u don't mean to use harsh words on him.<br>  <br>  Compromise with him & let him know that he shld not be so sarcastic. After all, it's your effort & that human shld know how to respect each other.<br>  <br>  Hope u make up with ur friend soon.|`|iNgfizSgaa	Having lived through similar experiences and regrets, my advice is to just suck it up and apologize to him. You can never overestimate the value of a good friend, even if they get on your nerves.

Learn warning signs, what questions to ask and how to get help.<br>  <br>  Hearing someone talk about suicide can be distressful and upsetting. You want to help him or her stay safe and get professional treatment. But you may not be sure how to help, whether you should take talk of suicide seriously, or if your intervention might even make the situation worse.<br>  <br>  Certainly, not everyone who has thoughts of suicide or talks about suicide actually attempts it. But most people who take their own life have expressed their intention at some time. That's why it's important to take any talk or threat of suicide seriously, especially when someone has depression or another mental disorder, is intoxicated, or is behaving impulsively or recklessly.<br>  <br>  While it may not be possible to prevent all suicides, your active involvement may make a difference in saving a life. Learn effective, compassionate ways to intervene and guide someone toward professional help when he or she may be considering suicide.<br>  Know who's at risk of suicide<br>  <br>  Understanding who's at a higher risk of suicide can help prevent a tragedy. While you don't necessarily need to constantly monitor someone who's at higher risk, you may be more alert for possible problems. Factors that may increase someone's risk of suicide include:<br>  <br>      * Previous suicide attempts<br>      * Having a psychiatric disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or personality disorders<br>      * Alcohol or substance abuse<br>      * A family history of mental disorders or substance abuse<br>      * A family history of suicide<br>      * Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse<br>      * Firearms in the home<br>      * A significant medical illness, such as cancer or chronic pain|`|NDEDBvcSaa	No this is not normal, and thoughts of suicide is very serious! you need to talk to someone that is experienced in this type of stuff!<br>  <br>  Call the national Community Crisis Center :  1-800- SUICIDE|`|bkgBLjuvaa	yes, it's normal. i go through that ALOT !

AA10197672	You will need to contact the court where you believe the ppw was turned in and they will give you the status...|`|cdQryr7paa	What do you care if HE wants a divorce?<br>  If YOU want a divorce, and I assume you do, get the ball rolling and get it over with.<br>  He won't contact you, so obviously it's not a big concern of his.<br>  Get it over with and move on with your life.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The biggest problem he will face if filing for divorce elsewhere is he needs to meet that states residency requirement to file. now if you think he has actually left you meaning abdonment of the marriage, you can always file first for a divorce with a missing spouse. If he does file you should be served due process of law which means being served divorce papers if he gives your address. now if you know excatly where in NC he is and have a friend or relative there, tell them to watch the papers to see if he files for one with a missing spouse which would be pretty chickensh.t on his part but happens. Filing a divorce with a missing spouse requires one to print in the local newspaper for about 30days the legal action to be taken, divorce, and to who, you, and then tells of date and time of court date which you would need to appear. But the problem being you may not see this and would inevitably miss the court date and then he wins by default and everything he files for and theres nothing you can do legally about it. the same would be true too if you filed first for divorce with a missing spouse. You have my email address if you need further help|`|RGcXgjEDaa	I believe you can still file for a divorce, they will send the papers to his last known address, I believe they will set a court date for the divorce if he doesn't show then then the file will be granted.

Quit wondering what he wants and file for divorce.|`|y6HmMl9naa	I think you had to be served by someone!!!!|`|goY0JHzlaa	Listen, you keep asking the same question over and over. I know you are hurting and don't know what to do right now. But, you have to be strong for yourself. If he files for a divorce, then he files for it. You won't know until you get served with the papers. In the mean time, make sure you can support yourself financially. He left. That's not a good sign. But, if you are willing to wait around until he gets his finger out of his butt, well, that's up to you. Personally I wouldn't wait. He left you. And he did so in a cowardly way. He didn't say anything. He just up and left. Now, think abou this. Is that being fair to you? No explanation? He is leaving you hanging. It is apparrent that you can not depend on him to be honest with you. He sounds immature. Also, having his mother call you is another cop out. By the way, you can get a copy of your marriage license at the county court house where you got married for a small free. SO, just because he has that means nothing really. Stay strong and fight for yourself. Only you can depend on you. So take care of number one first.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	There is no way to know if he wants one or is in the process of filing for a divorce unless you ask him. If you cannot contact him you'll have to wait for papers. He is required by law to serve you with a copy of the divorce papers that he's filed.<br>  You can either wait, or file for divorce yourself.

umhMpKz7aa	i think if you do not like her break up with her. even though you feel like she would kill herself you know you cannot stay with a person you don't want to be with.(lying to her will weave a whole other set of problems and prolongs the inevitable)  i keep thinking to myself, it will be painful, but maybe that is what she needs to get some emotional help...if she is verbalizing that she would kill herself, this has less to do with you than you think...she is what you call codependent. she needs to understand that her life or happiness does not depend on you..believe me, see this red flag because i have seen it tear alot of marriages apart. she needs to mature emotionally and breaking up will hopefully force her to work on herself a little more and not focus on you. it would not be fair for her for you to keep being with her. in this case it would be "caring" for her more to break up.|`|rq7t4Y5Taa	..sure it seems she is a bit insane and very dependent on you but try to show her that you are not the only man she could love or the only one that could make her happy..hmmm..it is complicated,  but if you don't love her you have to be honest, sincere and try to understand her too. i think there's no other way now that the love is gone.  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10877143	Well i honestly dont think that she would kill herself; but you shouldnt stay in a relationship that you dont want; its not fair to her. I think you need to sit down with her (in person) and tell her how you feel. Be friends for a while; watch out for her.
Ot2tJXU2aa	First it would be easier to answer if we knew what she lied about? But an employee evaluation doesn't mean that they are doing a back ground check, they would have done or else they wouldn't have hired her.  They are going to evaluate her performance pertaining to her job! So relax and by all means don't quit! She has nothing to loose now! So what if she gets fired and it may be for other reasons which will only help her to know what she shouldn't do or should do for her next job. Who knows she may get a big pat on the back for a good job.  You can't go to jail for<br>  lying on a application.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I wouldn't say anything at this point. There's no reason to quit because more than likely they haven't found out anything new. If they were going to fire her because of lying, they would have already. Evaluations are usually based on job performance, not resume info. Tell her to stay cool and calm.|`|QzZlxN1yaa	just wait everybody lies on there resume shes not the first one and it all comes out well.

AA10075527	omg why did u do that?<br>  beg for her pardon.|`|40CG6CK0aa	DUMB *** .<br>  If Yu Thought She Was Mad At Yu Then Yu Turn In To An *** Then WTF ?<br>  Ihts Yer Fault . She Was Playn Hard Tah Get Nd She Noticed Yu Were Feelin Her ..<br>  Tell Her How Yu Feel
brkvK1Teaa	It means that you are compatible and are also truly in love.  So don't make any more of it.  It's as simple as that.  Consider yourself lucky.|`|LAx5rfm4aa	you need him|`|th7C1aoaaa	It means your in love.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It means you have a good connection and should get married.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	it means you are suppose to be with someone else.
cdQryr7paa	It pretty much depends on your beliefs.<br>  The religious sector of the world will tell you it's wrong and will quote Bible verses at you to prove it. <br>  They will predict lightning bolts flying at you and the hot fires of hell to look forward to.<br>  A more realistic view will tell you that you need to use your judgment and be careful, not only because of the pregnancy possibility, but the STD situation as well.<br>  Pre-marital sex has been around as long as adultery, it's there.<br>  It's every person's decision whether they will do it or not.<br>  Humans are sexual beings, it's just how we are made.|`|QK4r41Hqaa	I heard a reasonable explanation for this... but I can't remember it, so it must not have been all good of an explanation.<br>  <br>  I think it's mostly because it's more safe that way, and because of a "trust" thing.<br>  <br>  Not like anyone follows that, I don't think many people think that it's bad anymore.<br>  <br>  and to teterbor:<br>  I'm 17 and I've never kissed anyone, gone on a date, or had sex.<br>  (I've been asked out, just didn't want a meaningless relation ship.)<br>  <br>  Not everyone over 16 has had sex. It's probably safe to say a LOT of people have, but not everyone.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Let's be honest here : do you really believe that there is someone out there over the age of 16 who hasn't had pre-marital sex?. Who am I to say that it's wrong and go against the majority ? So I keep quiet and keep my opinion to myself.|`|61Fwbi79aa	I sure hope not. Because I like it. A lot. And post marital sex was nonexistant. At least in my last marriage.|`|479460cc8a083eaa121c7c4f99e95066aa	Having sex before marriage is not wrong if you do not mind getting hurt, getting pregnant, getting disease or getting a guilty conscious. All are possibilities that upset many women after the act. Some women have no conscious and some have been damaged when they were children and know no other way. Sex can be used as a tool to get things, sex is considered empowering, sex is sometime used to populate countries.<br>  Sex should be used cautiously and for all the right reasons; love, creating children, show of unity and keeping the ties that bind.|`|AA11142539	I would say pre-marital sex is almost a requirement for compatibility unless your marriage is arranged by third parties and regardless of your compatibility you WILL be getting married and deal with it.  Then it's not such a big deal.<br>  <br>  The religious nuts will have their own views on it, of course.  this is assuming you are not one of those.|`|An6FwFoMaa	No. Nobody gets harmed if there is consent. If there is no consent (pedophilia, rape, bestiality, other forms of sexual abuse) then it is wrong- but those are separate issues entirely, since there is a victim. But when it's pre-marital sex between two consenting adults, then it's not wrong.|`|Chib4b8saa	Well, if it's wrong, then 99% of the people are guilty of it. Religious freaks, no offense to anyone, will tell you it's horrible, but come on? Who honestly has sex for the first time; after they're married? How do you know if you're even compatible?  I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	No it's not. Sex is a very important part of a marriage. Important enough that I will not leave it to chance to decide if my husband is compatible with me or not.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	If both partners are of legal age it is not wrong.|`|989a67242cef890c9a4d766cb208a561aa	If your both consenting adults, then not at all.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It's up to what you believe. I don't think it's wrong.|`|p9QglBpyaa	I personally believe it is, not only from a religious standpoint, but also logically. It just makes sense to me to avoid heartbreak, feeling used, and risk of unwanted pregnancies and diseases. I wanted to be able to give my husband every piece of me, not just what was left over.<br>  <br>  And I hate the analogy of "test driving a car before you buy it". Excuse me, but if you only see your spouse as a possession that you have to "try out" before committing to, you have no clue what the meaning of unconditional love is. I think it shows absolute, true love and commitment when you are willing to wait.|`|LSzXKw8Saa	I don't think its wrong.<br>  Mainly why people tell you to wait until you're married to have sex is because of the possibility of a pregnancy, and it's easier to deal with pregnancy if you are in a solid relationship.<br>  Other than that, sex is based on how much you love the person and nothing else.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Probably not but that's something that's left to individual opinion.  Sometimes people become disappointed after that first sexual encounter and it ruins the relationship.  Finding out if you are compatible in every sense is a good idea.  On the other hand some people don't care so it's up to you and how you feel.  Good luck.|`|abf1bb619e33219626c5a51afbf513daaa	It depends on who you ask the question.<br>  <br>  If you're asking someone who has religious beliefs, then, yes it's wrong.<br>  <br>  If you ask non-religious people, most will say it's ok.<br>  <br>  You have to decide within yourself where your beliefs lie, then decide for yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	I don't believe there is anything wrong between two consenting adults in the privacy of their own space.<br>  <br>  I have many fond memories of premarital sex and look forward to the future and further experiences...|`|AA10199949	Your gonna have to weigh that one out for yourself because you might not want to put up with being a cow and giving milk for free but if it doesn't bother you then by all means live your life for you.|`|th7C1aoaaa	You test drive a car before you buy it don't you. Think about the ramifications, if your married and find out your not sexually compatible.|`|h6YdTiyUaa	Yes it's wrong but I think a whopping 98-99% of Americans engage in sex outside of marriage. That doesn't make it right though.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I did that and I didn't find it to be wrong.  I learned a lot from it.|`|twVyisGnaa	I only think you should have sex with someone if you really love each other.  Make it something really special and romantic.  I'm still a virgin, but I don't wanna wait until marriage.  However, I'm not losing my virginity to a one-night stand.  I'm gonna wait for the woman I love and that loves me.  For me, there's a whole emotional aspect to sex.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!
blOfX1nhaa	I have no Idea why dont u know who ur dad iz?|`|wy5SiCS2aa	I don't know about getting back child support, but if you want to find your dad because you want to get to know him or whatever that's different. Here's how I found my ex boyfriend once. There are free white pages on the Internet, I brought up every person who had that name and started calling them, and emailing them. I'd start out by saying, I'm looking for a person that has your name, and I'm calling in the hopes that it's you. Then tell them something about myself to see if it sounded familiar. I found him after about writing ten people. Ask them if they were ever with a woman by the name of your mom.|`|lFR1YxzSaa	37 and now you want to try and collect child support ??<br>  <br>  Move on perhaps seek out a therapist to over come your emotional distress.
65ojSBXgaa	Well this situation is very hard on you very hard to let go. You lost a dear friend of 8 yrs that’s a long time. My question to you is; What do you want? I don’t know your relationship with this boy so I ask this because do you really want to loose him? That is a long time friend and these types are very rare and so hard to find so consider that special. If there’s any way you can save that relationship I advice you to do it. Was the fight or argument really worth loosing a best friend? He must have been your best friend for a reason, right? When you are in any type of relationship it takes work and effort to keep it together nothing in this world is perfect. But again I don’t know what happened. Anyways if this guy wont budge and is a total jerk who hurt you then don’t waste your time it’s done its over and you tried, don’t let one person’s mistake take over your feelings not everyone’s the same you just got to learn to see. Give other people a chance all they want is for you to be happy….   Take care toots and hope all will end well    -Gail Girl!|`|XQGm3lfPaa	try to talk to him and see whats wrong.  if he was really your friend he would tell you and he probably wants to be your friend again too.  Just try to talk to him or get a new best friend|`|LkmgsWVGaa	i know how u feel...i've just lost my best friend and it hurts like crazy...I feel really alone and dont know if i'll ever trust anyone like that again.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	you find a new best friend and go on with life,  its not like you were going to marry him.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Move on. That's all you can do. Tell the people who keep asking about him that the two of you aren't in touch anymore. Considering you've already tried to talk to him, he's obviously not interested in getting close again. Put the pictures in a photo album, put it on your shelf, and forget about it. No, it's not easy, but if you want to put this behind you, you have to try, and not have things all around you to keep bringing it back.
oCG8lJwaaa	Aaaww, I think that is quiet sweet, he may be popular, but if he likes u then hey...who cares? don't be insecure, it's down to u two at the end of the day...I keep telling people this, as they would also come to me and ask what they should do with their popular crushes...<br>  <br>  I think if he starting to show signs like u said then hey aren't u lucky?? he's there 4 u to grab...and he must speak to his friends bout u too that's probably why they're making the effort...enjoy it, go with the flow..and 'yes' arguing and name calling is normal to show that u care for each other...it's what most of my friends do...hem, but not me, then again, I am different from, hem I'm a romantic, but me and my husband can be silly too sometimes...it's so much fun...<br>  <br>  Have u spoken to any of your friends? what do they think? Maybe u should try and ask him out? Good luck :)|`|SYDSk199aa	yes well done he likes you|`|fox5a3ePaa	Id say hes crazy about you|`|lSgBe5bMaa	aww, i think this is really cute. <br>  Shows he really cares about you. <br>  <br>  I think you should go for it. :)|`|xX7EnZsdaa	Before you actually do ANYTHING with this guy wait. The ultimate way to see if a guy likes you is to make him wait.|`|Wm24YP6caa	I'm pretty sure he likes you, and if my assumption is correct, then that was corny, but also very cute of him.|`|DdK97Ixcaa	i think he likes you. i think he was a joking friend at first and then realized that he actually had feelings for you.|`|2pNUIJ5Jaa	he has fallen for YOU big time girl
lIpjuMTHaa	Gosh, I dont even believe this story. Its not even a question really.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Cheaters all deserve STDs.

Then go with your new hot boyfriend but don't be suprised when he starts doing another girl behind your back.|`|SpTCiDQUaa	Okay..well, break up with your boyfriend. It's not that hard, really. Just don't cheat on him.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	That's horrible.<br>  <br>  Tell your boyfriend the truth, and end it with him, it isn't fair to him that he is getting cheated on, and what kind of person you are.<br>  <br>  Talk to him, my goodness, children these days.|`|dL2SelcBaa	you're a ******* *****.|`|PwBCYyfnaa	have both wats the harm then wen ur bf is gettin suspisios say it not wrking then for now you can get to no the other guy and see if hes right for you! x|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Wow.

And btw what the f*** was your question?|`|9t1taTCtaa	Why don't you just dump your boyfriend and stop acting like a ho... with all do respect... But if you like the new hotty drop the old one.......|`|sY1SjHeJaa	Tell your boyfriend you can't be with him anymore, and stop playing him. it's rude.|`|jTN50b5Haa	stop being a **** and either leave your b/f or stop seeing this guy, however hot you think he is its not fair on your b/f|`|f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	oh my... ok, you definitely need to let your boyfriend know that your not interested in him anymore. how would you like it if he did that to you behind your back? this is a big no-no, there's not even time to think about what to do, you just need to tell your boyfriend so he can move on and find someone better--someone that won't cheat on him.<br>  <br>  As for you, you just keep doing what your doing, clearly your enjoying it...you're so cruel.|`|DdK97Ixcaa	Choose the one you have more feelings for.|`|QBRPza93aa	Woman up to what you've done. Tell your boyfriend you've cheated on him and you want to break up. He doesn't deserve to waste his time with someone who's going to cheat on him. You're being totally unfair to both these guys. Not just that, but if the new guy knows you cheat, he might be skeptical as to if you'll cheat on him... and if he'll cheat with you.. who's to say he won't cheat with someone else!?!|`|3fV6zRlJaa	If u wanna be with the new guy GO!  its so wrong for u to be cheating! Put urself in ur bfs shoes.<br>  <br>  And yes, u r officially a **** now...|`|ckM1lYwoaa	you sound like ****.<br>  you dont deserve him, in my opinion.<br>  okay, bye.|`|XqqLlBe4aa	Congratulations!<br>  i hope this new guy gave you STDs :)|`|atPuxNiFaa	u cant cheat on someone so u need to pick. im not gonna tell u who to pick but u cant be a stupid person a jerk or a freak and cheat! i would freak if someone cheated on my or cheated on my friend so dont be that kind of person cuz they might both turn on u.|`|2pNUIJ5Jaa	dump your boyfriend to get with this new guy|`|AA12159953	you're a whore|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Never thought I'd say this on answers, <br>  <br>  Slluuut!!!|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Break up with your b/f. The longer you stay with him and cheat the worse it'll be. But you should also consider whether its love or lust.|`|zkV7BiRPaa	no, no, no, no.<br>  this is SO wrong.<br>  forgot about your boyfriend?<br>  your boyfriend doesn't deserve you.<br>  whore.|`|6GIu3Hhvaa	you really should tell your bf and end it he doesnt deserve this and you obviously arent ready to be with one person.|`|kxmp3M58aa	TTTTRRRRAAAAASSSSSHHHHH|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	dump your boyfriend for this guy problem solved. Pictures of you in bunny costume?|`|sJClbSHGaa	That's terrible that you were at the same exact party your boyfriend was at, and instead of hooking up with him, you hooked up with some other guy! You need to tell your boyfriend what you did and end it then unless you change your mind and decide that you want to stay with your boyfriend. Then, you still tell him, but tell him that you really want to try to work it out. But to continue cheating on him... that's just really wrong. How would you feel if he did this to you?|`|fPWiNzuQaa	You seem to have already made your choice. You can't have both and you know that. Someone will get hurt so you might as well tell your boyfriend now before he finds out later. It will be a lot worse if he finds out. Just remember, you want to start a relationship with someone based off of sex and those types of relationships are bound to fail somehow...your current boyfriend might not be there for you after this fling falls through.|`|YhKBmy2Taa	thats ridiculous!!!|`|p04IkRAQaa	You must have a sad sad life. Seriously.. you're a dumb little whore.  You cheated on your boyfriend for somebody who you think is "hot".  It doesn't matter is this guy is a ******** supermodel, cheating is NEVER okay!  How would you like it if your boyfriend did that to you?  He should.. because he is better than you anyways.  Don't keep cheating on your boyfriend!  I hope he does find out and tells you off.. and tells you how big of a whore you really are.  There's a comfy little place for people like you in Hell skank, I hope you like fire.|`|BvLAcCLyaa	I hope he finds out and dumps your *** you dumb w*h*o*r*e*.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Tell your boyfriend that you are tired of your relationship and that you are moving on. When he stops crying you can tell him good by. Do not date both of them at once you will screw up and tip your hand to one or both of them and they will figure it out and you could lose both of them.|`|W8Look0waa	You need to stop and think is this guy really worth losing your boyfriend. And stop leading your boyfriend on thinkings he's the only one that's WRONG. And for you to have sex at the party your boyfriend was hosting you should feel really dirty. All this just because the dude is hot think about that. THINK|`|VSwphyWPaa	ok you dump your old boy and go with the new one but don't cheat that is bad and don't listen to other people calling you a slut or trash your not you just got tiered of him and tell him that you are just not in to him anymore|`|r98mDSDxaa	Tell your boyfriend to stick it. but that is quite unfaithful like very unfaithful|`|AhQO6apoaa	if you really want to be with him, dump your bf<br>  dont run two at the same time<br>  that never ends well<br>  you just have to decide who you like more<br>  give it some more thought, make sure you dont want to be with him just cause hes hot|`|SiYgCLfUaa	oh great your boyfriend has been dating a trashy slut!listen your a slut get it through your head.oh and HOW CAN YOU FORGET ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND WHEN HE WAS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT YOU TO THE PARTY!god your soo dumb!|`|A0MTKSoiaa	trashtrashtrashtrashslutslut.|`|BSNxCAiIaa	Wow...how could you live with yourself!!!|`|BrvehodKaa	Well if you love your bf you wont do this but if you prefer the over guy then end it with your bf because it aint fair.

Do u want a lasting relationship built on more than just attraction? If  U really care about your bf  then y did u do it? If u still care about your bf then u need 2 tell him & spare him the pain of finding out about it from someone else. Love is patient ,kind,envies not, not proud ,boasteth not ,is  long-suffering... the list goes on ...does your relationship possess any of these qualities? It might be fun now to go from guy to guy but later down the road when u want a husband what r u going 2 do? So break up with your bf,have your fun,but don't forget what lasting relationships r  built on.If your just looking for fun then fine, but if u want a real relationship,then your going' about it in he wrong way. Whats on the inside is what counts .Value yourself!!!!!|`|aJb4Oddjaa	hay now you are a cheater yeaaaaa <br>  <br>  dump you BF EZ and don't use lines that are heard alot while dumping ppl it hurts to much <br>  <br>  but go after this new guy|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Congratulations! YOU ARE TRASH
NQwljNOoaa	Next time he does it, firmly tell him, "I am mommy.  You call me mommy".  Then proceed to ignore him from that point on no matter what he does until he addresses you correctly.  Do not respond if he cries, throws a fit, yells......until he calls you mommy.  Same with your husband and same thing for any member of your family or friends. You teach him respect for people's wishes like this  while he is young, and he will take you more seriously in the future.  When he does call you mommy, be pleasant and act like it is the first time you are hearing your name called. After a while, he will understand and not do it again.  Be prepared for him to test you.  He may after a while revert and call you by your name again, but just because he hasn't done it in a while, keep ignoring any instances of him calling you or your husband by name.  Kids will test their parents periodically to see if you will stick to what you tell them or if you will slip up and allow prior behaviors.  Keep vigilant about it, because it definitely works.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Don't answer to any other name but "mommy".  He will soon realise that by calling you by any other name, he will not get the attention he seeks.|`|sR6NlPsDaa	I can see that this is an issue 4 u. ask him why he wont call u mommy. if he wont tell u then try talking 2 Your husband about this. hope this helped u out!!! :)|`|VY97XjdCaa	dont answer to him. Tell him, "If you need something, son, you say mommy please.. or mommy may I "|`|wy5SiCS2aa	tell him it's disrespectful for him to call you by your name. He won't know what that means but it's a big word and he'll get silent for a minute, you can tell he's thinking. Then maybe he'll ask, what's disrespectful? and you can respond with something like "disrespectful means you don't love mommy." and he might wrap his little arms around you and say, I love you mommy. If not, just don't respond to him when he calls you by your name. If he's asking for something don't give it to him, just ignore him and walk away. Then you can say, oh, you're talking to me? I didn't know because you didn't say mommy.<br>  He's just going through a phase right now.|`|JVjHvx0Yaa	It's a team effort.<br>  <br>  Have your husband call you "Mommy" & respond to this. Also, when your son uses your 1st name -- ignore his requests (the non-important ones, like "give me that toy). While you ignore him, have your husband say "You gotta call her 'Mommy' " and give toy immediately after your son did it.|`|3jqcLj7Saa	ask you husband to call you mama and you call him daddy when the child is around. there is nothing wrong with this and if anyone asks tell them whats going on. Nothing wrong with it and before you know it the problem is solved.|`|kw1bBNqlaa	talk in third person, "mommy is going to go upstairs," "mommy is getting tired."<br>  <br>  <br>  try it. and have people call you mommy when he's around|`|6r6s5AfXaa	When he calls you by your first name...dont respond to him..that way he'll realize that he has to call you "mommy" in order to get a responce.|`|24dda675fb6d16d9983ecf2be00b7fedaa	say it a lot around him i guess|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I suggest taking your son to a family counselor. Bring his father along too. He needs to learn that you are his mom. I remember when my neice told her grandma that she wasn't her grandma and that Nana (her other grandma) was. When her grandma left for a couple of minutes, I sat her down and told her that was a very mean thing to say and that her grandma WAS her grandma. I made it very clear that she was to never say that again or she would be sent home (she did not want that to happen because she enjoys the time she spends with us). When her grandma came back, she said sorry and she has not said it since. Make it very clear to him how mean it is to call you by your first name and that if he wants something from you, you will be called mom, mommy, momma, mother, etc. Don't give him things until he calls you the way he should.
2jzb9wnoaa	Well, you don't have a reason to be sorry. I know it's easier said then done but I'd try to forget about it and make new friends. If someone stays mad at you for that long over something that little then they've got an issue. Just show people that you are not what she says.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!|`|AA11724083	shes obviously not a Friend act like shes acting make new Friends dont look at her try to stay out of her way and forget about her|`|l4l95d9Iaa	well you can always go up to her and tell her that she doesnt have to act like a b**** bcus u wanted to do sumthing with ur other friend and not her, its not shes never done sumthing with out u b4, and if shes goin to turn all of ur friends against and act like a 10 year old then she can, but shes goin 2 b the one bein a b**** not u. and if that doesnt work then u can always kill her..im just kidding ab that, but if that doesnt work than maybe you can talk to her and find out y she did wat she did and tell her how u feel, but i would rather cuss her out!|`|XQGm3lfPaa	if that was me I would try asking my othe friends why they are against me and try telling them the story of how your "other friend" got mad at you.  maybe the friend told them lies so just talk with the friends he/she turned on you|`|AA11982696	You have to show her youre tough and it doesnt bother you. If she wants to act like a b****, let her. Dont let her walk all over you!|`|IhrKsVCeaa	Bust a couple caps.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, just forget about it. Crash her party if no-one comes to yours.|`|tFOaj0d6aa	If she's being like that she's obviously not your friend. Make some new friends and throw a party with them !
F3KkB4GWaa	First off I have to congratulate you on the word flirtility it's pretty awesome. But on another note lol just because she's prettier than you doesn't mean he's going to automatically choose her over you. If he's a shy guy he probably flirts with her because she started it by making the first move so he's comfortable. But you should strike up a conversation with him based off something you have in common (which should be really easy since you have the play in common) then gauge his interest in you and go from there.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	If you plan on being in the theatre get used to it. Do you think Brad likes watching Angelina in bed with another guy?
IiHTk7ZHaa	When you really love someone, you want what's best for them. If you know you aren't perfect you don't want to make your perfect person's life any less than perfect. My opinion is that he likes you so much that he knows that he won't be perfect for you and that he can't make your life awesome, and he wants you to have an awesome life and enjoy it to the max. He's in shock that someone like you likes him and so he's telling you that cause he believes it's not possible for you to love him.<br>  <br>  Or he's seeing someone which is why he's so confusing and he likes the way you're treating you. Though from when he says "don't think I forgot about you" it's a sign he thinks about you all the time.<br>  <br>  Talk to him and tell him how badly you want him, tell him that you don't care about other people out there that may work for you it's him you want. <br>  Tell him "if you really love me enough than be with me. Prove your love, if you can't be with me then you don't love me enough, or at least give me a good enough reason why you can't be with me, I know there are other fish in the sea but what if I don't want them?"|`|YaITofFfaa	lol|`|PxMNxytjaa	he is in love with you and im sure you are in love with him to. PERFECT COUPLE|`|23284ebd5a2ecab2fa4743f56817385caa	bottom line....hes not that into you... you are not that important to him... as busy as life can get, if he really loves you... he will make time for you. he loves you? but you can do much better? hes just not that into you... or not at all, and just saying things to make you feel a lil better about that situation. # 2... keeping you around cuz he knows he can...<br>  <br>  at the end.. no one knows what he is exactly thinking or feeling.. maybe he does really care for you and hes just not ready to settle yet... and says you both should figure things out before committing again.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	It means: I love you, please, trust me, I have some things to solve, YOUR LOVE is with me, you'll be in touch as soon as possible.<br>   <br>  Erik Loves YOU, this is GREAT...so, wait for him, understand him, trust him !|`|J30Gh5O6aa	omg sooo creepy, my best friend is going through this situation almost exactly. And the dudes name is eric. weird! anyway i would move on.|`|atPuxNiFaa	well i think he meant that hes dating someone and loves them too|`|9PCY2ScMaa	he sounds a little insecure and as though he is trying to find out if you definately are sure you want to be with him so you should talk to him next time he says something and say that "what is the point in saying that as im not gonna meet everyone else when i am perfectly more than happy with you" and just make him know that you really like him and make a joke out of telling him not to keep saying stuff like that<br>  sorry if this is no help :D|`|IHUtA8o9aa	he probably means exactly what he said "find way better than him, and he is not that great". He know that he is soo busy with his life and cant make time for you like a real bf should.So he is telling you that they 're other guys out there who have the time to do stuff with you :)|`|JSakTuOHaa	He wants you to leave him so he doesn't have to be the one to hurt you. He wants it to be "your" decision. <br>  He still loves you, just not in love with you.|`|lvBXds5Baa	he loves you. it's hard to explain the whole "you could do better than me thing" but it doesn't mean he WANTS you to find someone better than him. it's not a bad thing, he cares about you.|`|lOGHxtoUaa	he does not think u love him. he is telling u that it is ok and you can see other people cuz he wants the best for you. so tell him you love him and u would rather be with him rather than anyone.|`|ilx6DeVYaa	sounds like he's stringing you along and he's just using you as a backup until he finds something better.|`|QKFMbJqlaa	no how u feel im in the exact smae situation guy says he love me and  really like him even tho he's not the greatest anyway if u really do like him just go for iim going for t=my guy u should join the club!!!!|`|lbt0ayPuaa	he likes u!!|`|mLU3DkTKaa	1 , he is probably only saying what he thinks you want to hear or he is repeating what you want him to hear , hear , typical male chromosome behavior , dont sweat it .    #2 , all he was trying to say was that you didnt think you could ever forget the lick he put on you . well did you , you know , forget ??? not that it is truly any of my business .|`|xX7EnZsdaa	If he's being serious...<br>  <br>  1. He really loves you and wants you to be happy even if that means that hes not right for you...<br>  <br>  2. He's always thinking of you.|`|S749Bbp9aa	1. means he doesnt want to rush you into anything and he wants you to feel like hes the best guy out threre before you date him. <br>  2. means he cares about you and doesnt stop thinking about you|`|qUvodeIbaa	I THINK THAT HE DO LOVE YOU ITS JUST THAT HE KNOWS THAT IF HE COMMITS TO YOU HES REALLY GOING TO HAVE TOO BECAUSE HE DONT WANT TO HURT YOU.|`|ZZ6roUpxaa	he obviously really loves you and hes just insecure and doesn't know how to express his love for you. good luck <br>  ~samantha|`|8z6vA3q6aa	1.he dosent want to hurt you<br>  2.he always thinking about you..|`|yk5mTMP4aa	He wants out.|`|7SFxTLeOaa	I think I might be the first guy answering your question.  Well, that said, here is my answer:<br>  <br>  1.  Erik says you could find way better as an indirect way of complimenting you while giving himself room to mess up.  Anytime he messes up or does something wrong or whatever, he will say that you are too good for him anyway so he messes up because he thinks it can't last and he's going to lose you one day anyway.  Not true.  But it is an easy way to string you along, wether he realizes he's doing it or not.<br>  <br>  Also, he is highly insecure...this is highly apparent due to worrying about the fact that you haven't met the other 6.2 billion people in the world.  He will always think you are going to leave, cheat, lie, whatever.  And with such a low level of self esteem, he will be highly dependent, controlling, and clingy.  If you want it, you want it, and if u don't, u don't!<br>  <br>  2.  This is jst a sweet way to to make you forgive, forget, and love him again.  it's your choice how you deal with it, but it is what it is.<br>  <br>  As long as you are informed, feel comfortable in your decision.
AA11599430	she might be able to use someone to talk to like a professional|`|99teIRU7aa	sounds mentaly disturbed|`|MiAbHPMgaa	I think you should join in. If you haven't a clue what they're doing then do summit else and make them just as confused. Or... do nothing.
7wL3RMN9aa	I'd try to guilt her into kinky sex acts when I got home.|`|wqchA8B7aa	No Way. No one deserves that. I'd just go home and take it out myself.|`|hs793CCxaa	Life is SUPPOSED to be easy. <br>  <br>  Take it out the night before, then there is no chance of forgetting it because you were running late etc. It's not that hard. <br>  <br>  Simple solutions to most problems stare us in the face!|`|p75ZEmjXaa	HHHAHAHHAHHAHAHHA.  No.<br>  <br>  First of all, I don't really care.  There are about 1,629,552 better things for me to worry about.  Secondly, if i did, my wife might divorce me.  Thirdly, she usually does take it out and I am the one more likely to forget.<br>  <br>  Did I mention, there are 1,629,552 better things to worry about?|`|vtW3qPZmaa	I'd want to know what he'd put in the trash that week that he was so desperate to get rid of .  Holy crap, it gets picked up every week, unless he's trying to dispose of body parts or something I can't see the big deal... and if he is you have way bigger issues than taking out the trash.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	That's why we take it out the night before.  Everybody's way too busy running around in the morning getting ready for work to remember the trash !!  Psst... it's not that big a deal either to have a fit over !!|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Wait till she got home.|`|NJkVyydqaa	no its just a mistake, if the husband forgot to do it dont yell at the wife for making a mistake that they did to. plus just take it out next week and if there is so much trash take it to the dump. if anything the wife should chew the husband out the wife is a woman, and woman need to be treated fairly|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	LOL this is hilarious! <br>  generally my hubs puts the trash out on the curb if my oldest son doesn't do it first. When he's overseas i handle all the "manly" chores. i don't see why man or woman would get their knickers in a twist about something that takes less time to do than calling to gripe about it.|`|sMgwk0jlaa	It depends?  Does she chew me out and give me a load of crap anytime I mess something up?  If so, then I might, but if we have a quieter kind of relationship, then no, I was probably just tease her about it once I got home.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	If she would do the same to me if I did it, then yes.|`|681cdc7b4046a0a5541c9e3d94132feaaa	Why couldn't he take it out the night before? Sounds like a lazy SOB|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	no that's my job, dog poop, clean reef tank, my dry cleaning. hes a wuss|`|FzFSzilmaa	no, cos i'd have put it out the night before... :D|`|XSfTRhwXaa	ah, no... dude should take a chill pill and take the trash out next week.<br>  it's no big deal... really.<br>  if he gives you grief, tell him to get lost.|`|th7C1aoaaa	No. Because if the trash isn't out it's my fault.
88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Where to start?<br>  1. I wore a formal dress rather than a traditional wedding dress<br>  2. My husband wore a suit.<br>  3. My sister-in-law got ordained over the internet in order to perform the ceremony.<br>  4. Our ceremony was outside.<br>  5. Both the ceremony and reception were at the zoo (in very nice parts of the zoo, but the zoo nonetheless).<br>  6. The processional songs were "At Last" and "Happy Together" while the recessional was "Signed, Sealed, Delivered".<br>  7. No garter toss or bouquet toss.<br>  8. We incorporated an Argentinian marriage lasso into the ceremony, though neither of us is Argentinian.<br>  9. The meal was half-served (soup, salad and dessert) and half buffet (the entrees).<br>  10.  We served wedding cupcakes and coffee at 10:00 (no wedding cake: dessert with dinner was apple tarts).<br>  11. Our favors were foam animal masks and goody bags of zoo-related trinkets.<br>  12. We wrote our own vows, and designed our own ceremony.<br>  13. We had only a best man and a matron of honor: no other wedding party.<br>  14. The only special dance was our first dance.<br>  15. My engagement ring is a family heirloom, in a band style, so I chose not to get a separate wedding band: I use my engagement ring as my wedding ring.  My husband chose not to get a ring at all.<br>  16.  For work reasons, we delayed our honeymoon until our first anniversary.<br>  17. We didn't have a receiving line.<br>  <br>  There may be more, but those are off the top of my head.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	We didn't do the "something old, something new" thing, or the garter.|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	no unity candles, No special dances besides our first dance. Even though this is not a big deal for me but i know some people are really traditional I'm not wearing a white dress. My fiance not only has seen my dress but has actually helped me put it and no speeches. i can't think of other ones right know. I'm trying to keep somethings traditional but that's because they are important to us.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	no one walking me down the isle.<br>  <br>  dress is not all white.<br>  <br>  no mother/father dances.<br>  <br>  no bouquet or garter toss.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	We're not religious but we're having a minister perform the ceremony outdoors. She's a friend of my fiance's family and is the same minister who baptized him and married his aunt and uncle.<br>  <br>  He's wearing a suit, I'm wearing a more casual dress and wont be wearing a veil (I'm still trying to figure out what I'll have as an alternative to that. I'm throwing around a few ideas in my head)<br>  <br>  We're not having the bridesmaids or groomsmen. We're simply having a maid of honor and a best man. <br>  <br>  We're having two flower girls and no ring bearer. <br>  <br>  No one is giving me away. We will meet at the end of the aisle and he'll take my hand and walk me down.<br>  <br>  We will be walking down to a led zeppelin song rather than to the traditional bridal march (it's pretty and instrumental, not hard rocking...lol)<br>  <br>  At the reception, we will not be doing the garter or bouquet toss. <br>  <br>  I think that each couple should decide what together what kind of wedding they want, and whatever conclusion they come to is the right one. If they want to keep all the traditions and have a big white wedding, that's great. If they don't that's great as well. Weddings aren't "supposed" to be any particular way. Being judgemental of anothers choices really is very uncouth, and personally I don't really like people who can't be respectful of others choices.|`|pMsMx817aa	im wearing a black dress<br>  even though a couple hundred years ago it wasnt tradition to wear white, but in todays world it is and so by me wearing black its non-traditional.  if that makes any sense at all<br>  im also standing on the opposite side, im supposed to stand on the left with my bridesmaides but im going to be standing on the right [same with the bridesmaides] and my hubby to be will be on the left with his groosmen <br>  <br>  both my parents will be walking me down the aisle<br>  <br>  the rest i guess will be traditional <br>  <br>  we're not bending over backwards to make our wedding unique, we're just fitting our wedding to our personality.<br>  <br>  ella|`|cGbTJobeaa	Some good friends of ours had a poker run for their reception. OK, this is so Wisconsin, but it was a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  They got married in a beer garden at our favorite bar. Then everyone, including the bride and groom, got on their Harleys (or went on a shuttle bus for those who did not want to get a DUI) and went on a beer run to several pre-designated bars in the area.  Around 5 hours later, they returned to the first bar and everyone who visited each of the 5 bars along the route drew a poker hand. The top hands won a kitty of money.<br>  <br>  It was very non-traditional and perfect for them.<br>  <br>  The only non-traditional thing that we really did at our reception was that our DJ also did karaoke.  A lot of our friends do karaoke, so we incorporated it into our reception. It was a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  Oh...and my bouquet was actually 2 separate bouquets that were put together to make a cascade style bouquet.  Instead of having a boquet toss, my husband and I walked over to where the Poker Run couple was sitting and I pulled the bottom half of my bouquet and handed it to the woman. I lifted the bottom of my dress and my husband removd my garter and handed it to the guy.  Their wedding was 3 months after ours.|`|884v4VhGaa	My fiance and I are walking in with our parents instead of with each other, and we're having an instrumental for the processional, instead of everyone singing.<br>  <br>  We're not having "giving away", but that's because we're not from traditions that do that - we wouldn't be able to incorporate something like that into the wedding, my pastor would kill us.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	I am having my 9 yr old son walk me down the aisle. This is my second marriage and really if anyone is "giving me away" or to share, it's him. I originally was going to walk by myself (giving myself to my groom) but thought it would be a great way to include him.<br>  I am not having any attendants or flower girl,ring bearer.<br>  It will be on the beach and a sound system or live music would be fairly expensive, so instead we are having a friend blow a conch horn just before I walk.<br>  I haven't seen the vows yet, but the minister is writing personal vows to "fit" us since we are non-religious. I also wrote a poem to include in the ceremony.|`|bQCfOftxaa	no unity candles, he's wearing a suit not a tux, no flower girl/ring bearer, no dance, only two speeches (welcome to the family, done by both sets of parents), no guest book (using a black tablecloth and having people sign it with silver sharpies and then using it on our head table at the reception)|`|pub2GLZPaa	Both parents walking me down, and none of this "who gives this bride away?" questions being asked<br>  <br>  No unity candles, garter belts, uncomfortable speeches, special dances (I always thought those were sort of cheesy)...|`|Ka7CVRYsaa	my fiance went dress shopping with me!!!!<br>  and we may take pictures before the ceremony (our ceremony will start at 5:30) followed by the reception right after, so he will see me before the wedding!|`|8a8CZqGLaa	No unity candles, no garter, no bouquet toss, no limo to drive us off, only a cake reception, no father to walk me down the aisle so I'm doing it by myself<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why am I getting thumbs down? =(|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Well I am still going with the "giving away" thing but in a different way (cause no one has the authority to give me to anyone).<br>  <br>  I am having both parents walk me down the aisle.  And the officiant is going to say, "who welcomes Justin into this family" then she will look at Justin's parents and say "who welcomes Nikki into their family". We thought it was nice to include both sets of parents some way.<br>  <br>  Also we are bucking the tradition of being gracious when it comes to gifts. I will demand them. haha I'm just kidding about that.<br>  <br>  He's wearing a suit, we're both writing our own vows. No religion is involved in our wedding at all. (which is one tradition his minister brother is HATING lol. So is my grandma. lol)  <br>  <br>  Also, at the reception I am changing into pink fuzzy slippers. I'm not wearing uncomfortable shoes all day. Actually I'm wearing flip flops for the ceremony anyways, but the pink fuzzy slippers will be fun! And when we do the garter (which I think is a kinky kind of tradition that I LOVE lol) it's going to surprise everyone. lol<br>  <br>  Oh and our ring bearer: we're putting our baby (our bichon-poodle) into a little tux. lol<br>  <br>  No receiving line. It's a small wedding, we can get around to everyone.<br>  <br>  Cupcakes instead of a wedding cake. We will have a top tier still though.  <br>  <br>  Cake topper is one of the ones where the woman is draggin the man by the scruff of his neck.|`|73fuqfSyaa	I am getting in the Bahamas, not eloping, our immediate family will be there. Only four people on each side. There will be no groomsmen or bridesmaids. My dad will walk me down the isle ( well sorta, it will be on the beach).

Then go back to bestie and ask her, look her in the eye, <br>  <br>  Why are you creating friction and drama. most likely she jealous of friendship with him or she just think it's funny and fun.

d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	Everyone will like to make some nice friends & I can understand how hard your situation is. Meanwhile you can try to write messages in a nice cute note, telling them you will like to get closer with them & continue to communicte with them in different creative ways.<br>  <br>  Making friends is all about sincerity & not what, who or how you are. Don't be too shy, cause there is nothing wrong to feel the need to try & communicate with another party. It's normal.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can start to write messages today & even draw cute pictures on your note & pass it to them. If you are nice & sincere to them, I am sure they will not look down on you. Have more confidents in yourself :-)

And I would not be surprised if<br>  the next time you go over to her house, she tries to kill you.<br>  I mean look at the way you talk about her ON THE INTERNET!<br>  If she sees this, (and you better pray she doesn't) you may <br>  have to seriously watch your back. <br>  And if she's been watching 24, she can probably do it <br>  in a way that is VERY PAINFUL!<br>  <br>  So maybe if a murder attempt comes your way, you'll think<br>  twice about posting awful things about her ON THE INTERNET!<br>  And she WILL try to kill you! Make no mistake about that!<br>  You ought to be freaking out! And her mom is probably gonna <br>  come after you too!<br>  <br>  So call the police!

P0Fjh59Eaa	I don't think that's "natural" at all. My husband is wrapped around my daughter's little finger and he loves his sons as well. <br>  Sounds like your daughter's father is immature and selfish.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Not normal. sorry.|`|iD4ejChZaa	maybe he wanted to in the beginning, but the mother made her into a mama's girl so he felt left out.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Yes, it is rather unusual if not downright weird that he has no interest in his daughter...He's either a narcissist or has real issues with the female gender or is just a plain, cold "fish" of a guy.  Is it possible he doesn't believe the child is his in the first place?  I can't imagine what accounts for his strange behavior.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	He's probably incapable of unconditional love with anyone. Is this the man you were talking about in your previous question? If yes, then no need to search too far. We're talking about a man with major dysfunctions here.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	No, that is not normal.  According to your other question, this man has mental problems.  Get you and your kids away from him as soon as possible!|`|81wvN8Rraa	Nope, maybe counseling can help him realize what is blocking him from loving the way he should.|`|goY0JHzlaa	He sounds immature or just selfish. Not everyone is cut out to be parents. This is why certain people shouldn't be allowed to reproduce.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	For some. Some fathers run out on their baby girls because they didn't want a girl. Therefore, they never give a chance for a bond to develop.|`|th7C1aoaaa	I don't know.

Tell your wife what YOU did, so she can move on.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Do you have a voice? A simple "you are a friend, your friendship is more than enough. (your wife) and I are happy to help out." The friendship between the two couples would be that much stronger. <br>  <br>  You showed her (and us) what you are really like.|`|bO2rzfISaa	This is disturbing and you are disgusting.

So maybe she told her husband a lie and said that you made the moves when in actuality you never did cause all you did was help them with $100 and told her to do the right thing. So to me you are NOT at fault for anything and i wouldn't help them anymore if i were you.|`|swErAbpQaa	"I don't believe you"...on the chance you're telling the truth, you were wrong on many levels. For one why were you driving "tipsy"? Also, when you offer to help someone there is never a condition to the offer. Remember that for future reference. Lastly, watch your back, because she will eventually tell her husband, or your wifey and then you will have to do whats right. You owe her an apology.|`|NGKwsawdaa	If you were just trying to help them out, then you would have just given her the hundred that you offered and not asked for anything in return.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Are you trying to say you're a victim in this situation? You could have told her no. Puleez! Here's an idea. Tell your wife what happened and see if she has any good advice for you.|`|CG5NnL8Yaa	You sound like a republican....always blaming the victim.|`|AA10199949	No your the jerk here all by yourself.. instead of being a neighbor you presented yourself as trick and used her.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	:-O|`|1epjqrflaa	I hope your wife does find out, your a bad husband and man.

Nobody can ask a question like this and expect a sympathetic answer. <br>  <br>  On the 1% chance you aren't, let me lay it out for you: You weren't generous. Instead, you took advantage of a family's desperation to get your knob scobbed. <br>  <br>  She wasn't soliciting you. She was basically confiding in you. And you degraded her in return. No wonder she isn't talking to you. I'm amazed her husband hasn't come over with a Louisville slugger to pay you back.|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	to be honest with you you really have some nerve posting this you are not the victim in this situation and of course they aren't gonna speak because for one she's embarrassed because she knows that she was wrong and for two that's his wife why would he speak and she probably added more to the story but still you both were in the wrong i say be a man tell your wife what happened and suffer the consequences buddy

So eventually I felt like I wasn't pretty enough and that he obviously didn't like me so...I stopped letting it show that I was flirting and that's when he realized that he was missing his chance to be in a relationship with a nice girl for a change.  The day I stopped flirting was Halloween...he asked me out that night after calling me because he said he needed to talk to me.<br>  So you decide...do you wanna try and atleast know the answer of why she was doing that or do you want to look back and think that if you would have asked her what was up, would things be different?<br>  GOOLUCK GUY|`|JZYsFg4Raa	You shouldn't assume that she doesn't like you. Although it sounds like she had been practically giving you the green light before, it is nothing wrong with being a little shy. However, there is such a thing as missed opportunities. I said that to say that you should just swallow your nerves and strike up a conversation. Maybe you shot down her confidence a bit when she was sending out all of those signs and she just feels like it is your turn to make a move. If you really like this girl, you can't be scared. Talk to her like you would talk to one of your friends. Don't over think. Act natural. At the very least, no matter the outcome, it will be better than wondering what if...

He gave names to all the livestock, birds, and wild animals. But still there was no companion suitable for him.<br>  21. So the Lord God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep. He took one of Adam's ribs and closed up the place from which he had taken it.<br>  22. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib and brought her to Adam.<br>  23. "At last!" Adam exclaimed. "She is part of my own flesh and bone! She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of a man."<br>  24.

It is usually very hard for the ones who want to take vengeance , especially your idea of v. <br>  I am not criticizing your thoughts neither suggest you go for it or get over it. <br>  By the way you have a lovely name.
deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Whatever you do please use caution. Too many times you young folks feel the need to over compensate. You are only 18...you have an entire adult life to live & learn. Don't rush it or make up for the last 18 years in a summer.<br>  <br>  Have fun & be safe.

AA10197672	YES YES and YES !!! :) I cant wait to get out of work and see him!...|`|gYWDrHVFaa	I'm really happy and looking forward to a lovely weekend with my dog.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	No, not really.  My wife will be crabby and not want to do anything, probably.  Then on saturday night i'll hold my breath while I try and guess if she wants any action, or if she's trying to get herself in the mood out of obligation.  On sunday morning, she'll read the paper for hours and accidentally forget about church.  I'll play with the kids and wonder if i'll ever have a fun time with my wife again some day.  Then i'll look forward to the kids' bedtime when I can look at porn.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Yes but I also have a big decision to make so kinda anxious....|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Yes, and it's cooling in the fridge as we speak.  Can't wait to pop open one of those Bud Light's|`|874EAxkfaa	yes see u saturday a. m.|`|O1b7das7aa	I'm really happy. I wish I could spend the weekend with hubby but I work weekends. <br>  <br>  We do take the time to have Sunday breakfast though.|`|AA11946390	YES!! This weekend me and my man will just lounge in the bed watching tv. We may go somewhere. But all I really want to do is cuddle up with my snugglebear.|`|LAx5rfm4aa	yes i am very happy|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	yes that would be me this weekend is gonna be great|`|X2rmZ58iaa	I was thinking that this morning, she broke up with me not long ago. Accepting loss is so hard, I really miss her :(
VjgIeIMgaa	lol we all need help dont we... this one is simple. just pull the all nighter like a week later. family goes before friends cuz u hav friends u'r whole life family is only for a while|`|pEgXJarLaa	Well, I would go to dinner with your family, then go be with your friends, then you get to see your family and be with your friends.|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	Been there done that. Family comes first. Friends will be around alot longer than Family|`|06iz5ttqaa	family comes first no matter what|`|vxjOpKruaa	Try to do both, maybe you can go see your family and tell them you have to leave early because your going to have a sleep over.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work out than go with your family, their more important.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!!!|`|KQqJjbLlaa	invite your friends over another time
Smy7Mwjsaa	well when it comes to the i love you thing those are strong words and maybe he/she wants to wait until they really fell that way but the pretty thing idk because my boyfriend and i have been together almost 5months now and he always tells me how beautiful i am as well as how much he loves me|`|AjPbtm7oaa	I would think that I was a self centered, over sensitive  attention attention ho. But then I'm not you.
9bdEPcWIaa	So what happens if you stay at your friends for a while?  You'll have to come back and sleep in your own room.<br>  Tell your parents as to whatever's bothering you.  You need to put a stop to this.  Tell them.  Your parents will deal with this, that's what parents are for.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Either way it wont get much better. <br>  <br>  You have to realize your options. <br>  If you tell someone then you could be ripping your family apart. <br>  But if you don't it could go back to the way it was.<br>  <br>  The safer choice would be to tell the guidance councilor and hope for the best. <br>  I'm sure it would be hard to talk to the parents because the way they didn't believe you at first but also give yourself the chance to talk to them. It could work out better.|`|wvKJLce8aa	That thing about your brother is really perverse and weird, and you shouldn't have to deal with it (and your parents shouldn't be ignoring you). Talk to the parents of your trusted friend and explain to them why you want to stay with them. Tell your parents where you will be. If your parents are concerned and worried, then maybe your friends parents can help defend you (as long as they comply and understand and want to help you). Have you spoken to a school counselor? Or a trusted teacher?|`|g2ulTHNGaa	If you feel unsafe in your own room @ your own home, something is SERIOUSLY wrong within your household. Maybe you should talk to your parents & if nothing changes the situation, or if they stick up for your brother, you could always go someone that you trust.|`|QkfGYIcxaa	I don't know whats up with your brother but your parents would be more likely to let you stay at a relative's than a friend's.  So that might be a good idea.|`|JUEkTETAaa	just tell them how u feel|`|ec3461a2ffbd06064e30c36f5e958792aa	first... is your brother hurting you... second .... CALL THE COPS ... you can get a great night sleep at a home with girls your age going thru the same thing you are. all in all CALL THE COPS! you should never feel unsafe where you live. the cops will help or you can call child services yourself and tell them what is happening. YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THERE!|`|1dXlkP1Oaa	I would recommend seeing a Guidance Counselor... or possible your local Police Department. People like him deserve to be in Prison.... Dont be scared to do so....DO IT! and it will be all over! Your brother wont be able to harm you anymore|`|KpKIpsACaa	Tell them if something bad happen to you then it's there fault. Tell them the situation. I'm pretty sure they will understand.|`|lzRQJCeeaa	ask your friend's mom to ask your parents|`|aJHMJYiDaa	Beat the living sh*t outta ur brother|`|JvOYhuIbaa	just say u were invited to a sleepover party or something and ask ur friend to have one for just the two of u.|`|TqQcB2gWaa	just tell them
0DOZKXwRaa	Be honest about it. Tell him (without her preferably) what you have seen and what you know. Don;t talk about gossip or anything like that, that is when things can get hurtful.<br>  Tell him that you love him, but that your daughter comes first and for the following reasons, you will not be taking her over for regular babysitting anymore, until those issues are resolved. <br>  Still bring your daughter over for visits, both for your brother's sake and your daughter's (she is young and wont understand why she cant go to her uncle's anymore)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LRF70DMjaa	I think you know the answer to your own question.  Your daughter definitely comes first.  Don't worry about hurt feelings.  Do what you NEED to do.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	your daughter is your responsibilty, look after her yourself!!!<br>  would you trust your sister in law with a billion dollars?|`|CnSaGHqWaa	Simply tell them the truth, that is, you feel they have enough on their plate with there own kids and you have found a daycare that will give individual attention (reading, counting, or what ever would be a good training day for her) to your daughter and you really want to try it out...Find the other daycare first. Good luck!
4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	I think it's a wonderful way to honor your future in-laws.  I'm sure they would be thrilled.  <br>  <br>  BTW, my youngest sister got married on the same date that I did--20 years later.  I could have cared less that she was marrying on my 20th anniversary--I just wished her as much happiness that my husband and I have shared over our 20 years (now 21!).|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I think it's really neat.  My husband and I got married in the same month that his parents did, and I thought that was special.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	It shows respect and hoping to have a successful marriage as they do.  :)|`|JtEBaOdjaa	As long as they are okay with it, there is no bad taste.  Run it by them before booking anything.  I'd be flattered if I were them.  If they have been married 35 years that date must be good luck right? lol<br>  Also, make sure YOUR parents aren't going to feel resentful.  They shouldn't and probably won't, but some people would so you want to make sure they know and aren't going to be really upset by it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! Sounds like a great idea.|`|F4k68ilkaa	Are his parents still married? <br>  <br>  In that case, go for it. It's excellent Karma, and they'll be honored, I'm sure.|`|0Id85yiYaa	aww. that's sweet. they would be so flattered, and yes, it's in good taste.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	It's a wonderful idea.  How sweet!  : )|`|5ptGztIbaa	does  your  fiance  agree  with u   cause   he  has  2   agree  with  u<br>  will  yes   u  should  get  married   the  same   day  your   fiance  parent's
Jqve5UPlaa	Everyones different, but people in a relationship generally have to be into the same thing. It was like this with my ex-boyfriend, and I wish I'd just spoken to him about it, because as you can tell it didn't work out. Talk to him, tell him how you feel and that you love it, but just don't want it all the time because if it happens rarely, you'll be much happier and probably more in love with him ;)<br>  Just talk!<br>  xo.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	You cant really expect him to change, I mean thats part of who he his, and u met him while he was like this, maybe he could just tone it down a bit, but hey u should be happy, not many men, who like all the romantic stuff these days, and have no problem showing there feelings|`|QKs0PFVpaa	Dump him. You cant change a person.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	oh my god your lucky!<br>  dont ask him to change thats just not nice... thats how he is and you are how you are.... you cant go changing to make someone happy, if he has so much love to give...then sorry he should be seeing someone who wants this attention and loves every second of it. not some one who wants him to change and stop doing it.<br>  i think the best thing is to end it with him, save him the heart break i know how it feels.|`|ebd01f2a9ac954de0f1feb8fb05fc0c7aa	Just tell him it straight up, you either stop not being clingy like a girl or im going to break up with you and you will never have me again. Im sure he will change.|`|xuzFEc0jaa	You guys will sort it out even if it means a break up (which will just be a break if you want it to b) This guy sounds like the guy that wont move on easily.|`|wFXM8155aa	I had exactly the same problem with my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  What I done was took a few days away from him just to see if I missed him when I wasn't around him and said to him before that I wanted a few days apart to just have some 'me' time and I explained that I was feeling too claustrophobic with him and that he needed to know that I wasn't going anywhere so there was no need to be so clingy.<br>  <br>  After a few days I seen him and realised that I'd actually missed him and the time apart was what I needed to make me realise how much I still liked him, he also understood that he cannot be so clingy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|1jdRPGMyaa	Love is mans biggest downfall.Tell him to get the hell away from you. Dont feel remorse, youll probably never see him again. Gennerally the girl is the one who judges fully by emotion, and guys judge half emotion half logic. My goal is to only judge by logic, I think thats what you should do here. Your just hurting both of yourselves if you dont break up with him. He'll be torn by the fact that you aren't responding to his emotional outcries, and youll be annoyed. Simple|`|2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	Awww poor guy. He's trying to show you some love and you basically sound like you don't care. Its hard getting a guy that will regularry show his feelings to you. If its a bit over the top just tell him but he probably keeps carrying on with it because your not giving him anything back.|`|u8279G1kaa	You're one lucky girl, I'd love a guy like that...<br>  But if you don't like it, it's up to nobody but yourself to decide what to do, seriously.|`|woUh3KL7aa	Well, he won't change. Even later.<br>  If it turns you off, it will keep turning you off.<br>  <br>  Give him boundaries, and then stick to them. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  I like mushy, but not too needy.|`|JPMmlW5Qaa	DUMP him it will ONLY get worse over time NEVER better.|`|4xZytkilaa	Dump|`|g5ZkO2fKaa	DUMP him it will ONLY get worse over time NEVER better.
N8RKcVGoaa	One year is a long time in some how ,I would do all the things I like and love and apologize to everyone I hurt even if he/she are not worth it, and I will eat,dress and do everything I like not caring about others words,and surrounding my self with every one I love, giving every body really cool gifts and giving alot of what I have to poor people and adopting kids for like a day and make them happy and do eveything they dream about as long as I can,and going to Disney land and going to do Hajj I am a Muslim and also this will be the first  thing to do getting more close to Allah.|`|TEzzcwA7aa	Stop worrying about what I eat and spend more time with my family. I'd also give my treasured and sentimental items to my nieces and nephews.|`|69fa948353d1dbf575b7e1dd974f6570aa	go to canada|`|th7C1aoaaa	Live like I was dying.
RXI8ImdIaa	I don't know how old you guys are, but I suspect that maybe you are a bit more emotionally mature than these boys are. That happens a lot in early teens, girls 'grow up' a year or so before a lot of the boys.<br>  <br>  If they're being stupid, just let it go. Look for someone who behaves in a way that you can get along with.|`|aBqJhdufaa	No, it looks like he's creeped out by you.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	It doesn't sound like it sweet heart, sorry.<br>  Look at this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4706152_tell-guy-likes.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4706152_tell-guy...</a>|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	Hopefully he's not being a jerk and they're making fun of you cuz he knows you like him =(|`|tZiVdU8Xaa	maybe there bothering you because they know that you had liked him|`|J7k4xJtoaa	He probably does when it comes to guys at that age they don't really know how express what they would like to do, so what they do is ask the other guys who are clueless on what they should do..

Be careful... Teenage guys can be pretty mean and obviously I don't know this guy but by the sounds of it... he could be one of them... I hope this helps and i really hope you don't get hurt.. Sorry sweetie..|`|InlBfPM9aa	i think he does and his friends probably all know and thats why they did that.<br>  i think you should confront him.ask him about his recent behavior around you and his friends. maybe you guys could be something. goodluck!|`|mLU3DkTKaa	why dont you ask him , point blank and quit beating around your bush .|`|HvQjU2vCaa	I would say they are bothering you because they know you like him|`|UOSrSEqHaa	Who knows.

Go by an MP3 player and a MORE EXPENSIVE SET OF EARBUDS (I recommend the $100 Bose Earbuds), make sure your<br>  mp3 player is at least 2GB<br>  3. Get yourself a gym membership and go to the gym alone, it will feel weird at first but after awhile you'll realize that EVERYONE goes to the gym alone.<br>  4. Work out. Work your A/*s*/s* off. Work yourself silly. Do the weights TOO. DO IT ALL, GIRL.<br>  5. Swim after you are done with your work out to relax. Don't worry about your little boyfriend. Maybe he'll get jealous, maybe he won't. Who cares. You'll proabably meet 10X the guy at the gym anyway. NOW GO DO IT. If you do, I guarentee you will BE SOOOOOOO HAPPY that you did, you won't know who to that (me (just think about this message and say "thanks john"), that's all I ask)     -JOHN IN ILLINOIS
qbbNtGVcaa	i actually just had the same problem happen to me! i ended up sitting with the group of friends that are fun and i brought my best friend with me from my old table. we have so much fun there now and i wouldn't want to sit at my old table. or maybe everyday u could switch tables. that's what my one friend from my new table did with me but now i sit there so she doesn't have to haha. but still be friends with the old table people but explain that you want to try something new and don't hate them or anything. good luck!  have fun! :)

F4k68ilkaa	Oh lord, I wish I knew...<br>  I'm terrible at this sort of thing. <br>  <br>  We're getting married on 6-13-09  - the idea that I had was to do cream colored tablecloths, with cream colored orchids, in chocolate brown square planters. Our colors are cream, brown, and green (leaves). <br>  <br>  Another idea I had was to do a green dish filled with brown river rocks, with a gardenia blossom floating in water.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	March 14th- about 9 inch tall round vases, filled with water, with clear and lilac pebbles in the bottom (our colors are white and lilac and our flowers are roses), with a lilac rose floating candle on top, and the pebbles spread around the vase bottom.

I love the slim-cut, sophisticated gowns that look more like eveningwear than a poofy princess costume. <br>  <br>  I think you made the right choice. I like the V-neck of the second dress, but not the back bow. But the first one I totally love - you are going to look like an elegant lady.|`|F4k68ilkaa	I prefer the first one. It depends on what kind of wedding you're having which one would be more appropriate. The second would be more appropriate for an outdoor, casual, or destination wedding.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i was just about to type that there is no comparison and that the first one is way better <br>  <br>  but then i saw the back of the second one. <br>  <br>  the first one definitely is more beautiful but the second one is a very close runner up. i love the back|`|1KfbgBupaa	Dress #1 is very sophisticated and I really like it. <br>  <br>  Dress #2 is much more innocent.  Will it look good with a veil?|`|T2QieSzPaa	I really, really don't care for either.|`|TJKvoLeBaa	The first one looks much more like a wedding gown.  Very clean and elegant.   Good choice. <br>  <br>  The second is very casual almost JC Pennish.  It would be good for a very casual beach wedding or a back yard BBQ wedding.  <br>  <br>  I think you made the right choice.|`|VaZGN8P9aa	I would pick the first one. I really like how the fabric looks and how it falls around the bottom. The second one isn't really my style.

PQwRl27Jaa	not all guys cheat n plus girls do 2 i dont like cheaters.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	im sure there are some that can be happy with just one girl but ive yet to meet him.|`|yARKV3PXaa	I can be but try telling that to my girlfriend. She is always worried when I go out without her.|`|sJClbSHGaa	Not all guys feel that way! My boyfriend is very happy with having just me! You just seem to have a terrible taste in boys. Look for someone based on their personality and not just their looks and see what kind of guy you end up. You'll probably be with a guy who worships the ground you walk on and would never think of cheating.|`|u5XEf5Wwaa	girls cheat also, alot|`|oTEYvL7oaa	thats a good question.|`|7df696c9cb295fc847d5df729b0d51ddaa	Nope, not all of them can't. Guys think that while they're young they have to do it all. Feeling don't come into play at all.|`|rQf0XZfXaa	i think you should just let him **** you every night and he wont cheat on you
IsRk5ZoVaa	dont listen its really hard be who you want to be not who people want too see.<br>  but you shouldnt let it cuz they wouldnt like it if it was them,<br>  haters are nuthinn they just want something too say.<br>  it might not be true if you know its not then you shouldnt even care,<br>  as long as you got a good set of friends and they can back you up then your good :)<br>  but dont even trip!|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Have high self esteem.<br>  If you are a good person, know it & acknowledge it.<br>  <br>  Stay away from the 'bad people'.<br>  We all care what people might think or say, the issue is to not put much value in it.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	i ask myself that question everyday..:(..<br>  i think you need to realise the ppl who say these things are not worth it...they are mean and horrible ppl who get their happines from being horrible..what kind of person is that/? the sooner you realise how stupid these people are, the sooner you will stop caring about their stupid opinions...!! good luck.xxxx|`|KxMzBFR2aa	be your own person and if any one has something to say step up for your self
AA11071040	You are neither.  You are learning.  That is what the classes and the tests are for.  You analyze now and when you are in the real world, you remember the answers.  Most of the time, the doctors are just guessing on what is wrong.  Flu-like symptoms can be hundreds of different things, so they do the tests to narrow it down.  Don't be hard on yourself, just remember what you are learning and be the best nurse you can.  Nurses should be admired, doing a whole lot of work for little pay and no appreciation, they should give you a medal just for wanting to do it!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	No you are not dumb.Had you made a zero that'd be a different story.<br>  Next when you are out in the real world you will gain experience and the way you do that is to ask questions from those you work with and have experience.Never be afraid to ask for help or ask a question especially in the nursing field hon.|`|C8SQS8t3aa	no its obvious your a cleaver person in this area. your goin to gain more experience as you diagnose and treat each patient. Dont be worried, Im sure you will be an excellent nurse.|`|99teIRU7aa	plenty of smarticles!
707gOCvbaa	She's trying to make someone jealous. That only leads to trouble. Tell her to stop toying with the new guy and leading him on. She needs to invest that energy on the guy she really wants.|`|fhzHiBMyaa	Aright, this is the way it goes. Guy; player .. and she girls are either a slut or whore.|`|dVrHELZ2aa	Guys are players, girls are sluts.<br>  <br>  It's all the same thing...just a different word for it.|`|pvosPN40aa	why do you even care if your not one of the guys shes flirting with?|`|PxMNxytjaa	stop leading him on|`|fb5d7O6Saa	I don't know that you need to tell her anything. If you just want to, tell her to chill out. This girl may be a big flirt. If she is doing it in close range, they both see what's happening, I don't think she's trying to be a player. Players usually try to hide behavior so they don't get caught. She is just a big flirt|`|9PCY2ScMaa	just tell her that everyone can see what she is doing and shes making a fool out of herself and that if she wants to gain respect she should stop leading them both on but dont be a complete ***** to her about it as it wil make her do it more just tell her that its your advice but she can do what she wants and if she doesnt listen then you cant say u didnt try :D|`|zfKzLFgxaa	tell her to stop doing that in school, tell her to do it in an appropriate place like on a street corner in a bad neighborhood xD or a burlesque house|`|ze4Gt1araa	Nothing, don't tell her nothing that's no one's business of she's a player or not.<br>  <br>  But yeah by the way that girl is a player.|`|JMdXd3ZZaa	Yeah, she's probably a whore.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	why do you care?<br>  just tell her she's being a sl*t|`|fmATfubnaa	tell her to pick a guy and stick with him lol|`|DKDkXgfOaa	she's making the other guy sad. :(|`|B0y9aO1Laa	She obviously is trying to make the other guy jealous or she simply loves watching guys compete for her.  Either way its not cool! Tell her  to stop playing with their emotions cause karma's a b***h.|`|7437a3cdb4e7f01087cec9c9c42fcb58aa	GIRLS ARE NOT SLUTS!!!!! We just like to have fun just like any guys. Double standard, egotistical pigs. <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way don't talk to her, ignore her, she's probably from a trailer park.|`|XsNqpRWwaa	tell her to stop being a loser and playing with their heads. its unfair for all these guys to fall victim to her little scheme.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	Nothing, if she wants to be a flirt then let her be a flirt.. <br>  It isn't your problem.. <br>  If you did say something to her it wouldn't matter, she's gonna do what she wants..|`|YRUf6BoWaa	maybe she is a player maybe she likes them both <br>  you know at this age you dont really fall in love so whatever <br>  <br>  have ever flirted with two girls at the same time?<br>  of course yes|`|qMsWcfNXaa	sounds like she wants all the attention and is a Promiscuous Girl. That kinda of girl gives us females a bad name. I hate that|`|rQf0XZfXaa	shes an *** hole|`|mLU3DkTKaa	tell her you want in her mix .|`|eiuEdujPaa	Sounds like she just likes the attention.|`|n1MZefbqaa	She likes the other guy and wants to make him jealous.|`|Joj7vRG8aa	maybe shes just flirty... or a whore|`|HFemIoh6aa	tell her "yo skank, if ur gna act like that, there's a car over there"!|`|17V8mXFdaa	She is and dont let her get to you... thatcould be aids already|`|06iz5ttqaa	tell her stop being a dirty hoe and find and get 1 man|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	stop leading them on...
5pN9OAA6aa	i think the best idea is to ask her..<br>  but start with the "do u have a bf now?" if she has..then shes pretty much playing with u.<br>  if not..ask her if she likes u...or maybe ask if she sees u as friend or more?|`|cJooDZpnaa	Here's a lesson man don't believe everything women say cause they lie alot|`|IMCYeBuQaa	awwwwwwwww this sounds sooooo cute. im a girl and i gotta tell u she digs u. wayy to many evidence|`|m67kW8XVaa	You gotta ask her. Maybe she does like you, and maybe she just likes you as a brother. <br>  Good Luck man :)
c9cEZGfraa	Well, if you keep it outside you obviousley have to put him in a rabbit cage. If you keep it caged and make sure it stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer, there's really no reason why he couldnt stay outside all the time. But your parents must have some reason for not letting you have one. Maybe they think you wont take care of it? If this is the case, maybe you could do something to prove to them that you are worthy of handling the responsibility. Good luck!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Sweetie, don't get one if your parents said no. They could live outside if they have a cage and the weather isn't too cold, but wouldn't you have to hide it? It's never a good idea to sneak and there's nothing good to be gained by this. I don't know how old you are, but maybe they just think you're not old enough to take on this responsibility. Ask them why you can't have one now and work towards getting them to change their mind later on.|`|36aPSk4oaa	I know bunnies are cute and cuddly, but honestly, they're not very good to have as pets.  They don't interact with people and are very nervous all the time.  They also frequently get sick (as pets) and often die before they reach their full age.
QIqPwcH6aa	You're an idiot to lie. Relationships are built on things like, wait for it... TRUST.|`|umhMpKz7aa	sounds like this is less about you lying and more about you not wanting her to break up with you. i think you know it was wrong to spend the night the minute you decided to lie about it. learn a "marriage" lesson. honesty may hurt the other person, but in the long run hurting you more. My advice is not about the lying it is how to try to keep her. Be vulnerable, humble yourself explain why the thought of her being mad at you tears you apart. tell her how stupid you were and that you swear to her that you have learned a great lesson about breaking her trust. that you will spend as long as it takes to earn her trust back...give you a second chance to prove you have learned a lesson. everyone deserves a second chance. then do your best to pull out all the stops to tell and show her you love her. good luck. i would give you another chance. its a hard lesson.|`|hBr3nfaIaa	Haha, that was stupid.<br>  If you knew it would make her mad you shouldn't have done it.<br>  Whether anything went on or not is beside the point.|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	Yeah, it sucks, and you definitely got yourself into this situation. By lying, it made you seem like you had something to hide about the sleepover, and your girlfriend naturally assumed that you were cheating. <br>  <br>  All you can do now is tell the truth. Say, "I'm so sorry. I lied to you about the sleepover because I didn't want you to be mad or worried for no reason, but I realize that was stupid. I know you're mad and you don't want to talk to me right now, but I promise you that I didn't cheat on you, and I never would. I love/really like you, and I want you to know you can trust me. Please forgive me"<br>  <br>  If you give her a sincere apology, tell the truth and remind her that you love her, hopefully in a few days she will come around. Don't go overboard with apologies (that will make you look guilty) but you're going to have to grovel for a little while.<br>  <br>  But if she still wants to break up, there's nothing more you can do except move on and learn from your mistakes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|dIYgPp5Iaa	You shouldn't have lied in the first place cuz now if your girlfriend stays with you she's not gonna trust you like she did beofre... If you say you are going one place she's gonna doubt you and she's gonna hound you till she believes your telling the truth so you have to be ready for that.. sorry but lying only makes things worse..|`|th7C1aoaaa	NO. Lying only hurts a relationship.|`|8Ck9ldIaaa	Hey don't be a foool you put your self in that position and you deserve everything you getl. Never lie in a relationship.
MgMsMExPaa	If you play your cards right all a's could be in your future. Your going to screw up if you don't follow through with this. If your first impulse was to date her then you should do that and worry about the teacher part later. Because she is new and dose not know many people you could look like a hero to her family for stepping up to the plate and trying to be friendly to her. This is a first impression decision you did this because you felt a attraction to her. Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you choose not to follow through with this you will always say to yourself " I could have had her but I was scared of the teacher" Dude this is a one in a million opportunity that you are wimping out on.|`|9IW20Qjbaa	Just go out and don't go again|`|o6FM4vEraa	Just dont be a jerk!|`|YRUf6BoWaa	like everybody else said if you really like her go out with her no matter what|`|ilx6DeVYaa	maybe if you date her daughter and be nice to her, then your math teacher will like you better? i'm not saying use her, but it doesn't have to be bad. you could go out with a nice girl, and you teacher won't hate you so much if he/she knows you're a good guy. i mean, the year's almost over, right? if you want to get out of it, just tell her you don't feel comfortable dating her because it would conflict with your math class and you don't want to put her or yourself in that position, or your math teacher either. say you should just be friends, and that maybe next year when you aren't a student to her parent. good luck|`|ZZ6roUpxaa	well since its your math teacher you should probably stay on best behavior and stay on her good side. you should still take her daughter out and keep your word. she probably doesn't know a lot of people since she is new so be nice and show her around. introduce her to different people to get her acquainted with people. her mother/your math teacher will appreciate you doing that for her. im sure things will go fine and you shouldn't stress over the fact that her moms your teacher best of luck<br>  ~ashley|`|fPWiNzuQaa	You shouldn't be afraid of who her parents are. Your math teacher can't do anything to you if you happen to date her daughter. Also, you can't take it back or you'll be in hot water with the both of them, so if she wants to go out with you then go with her.|`|5Ynm0bBraa	Don't take back what you said (if you mean it) just because her mom is your teacher.  One of my parents is a teacher and it makes it very difficult to get a bf.  Now if her dad was your teacher that could be more difficult.  But it's her mom so don't worry about it.  In school She's math teacher, out of school crushes/ gf mom.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|9PCY2ScMaa	dont worry about the teacher hating you, if you go out with her daughter and things go well, she is more likely to warm to you and not hate you, if you do nothing then things wontv change at all but you may as well try if you like this girl you shouldnt let your teacher stop you x|`|n1MZefbqaa	Well, if you asked her out you probably had a reason.  Go out with her, if things work out then good for you ( you'll ace math) if not then you guys can always be friends (and you'll probably fail...lol..sorry)|`|P9iKDXexaa	just take the girl out.<br>  <br>  If she said yes, theres obviously not a problem and its kinda f u c k e d up if you just call it off. She is new and all that.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	dude , sounds like there is only one way to make an A on the day they say " hey "  . hang in there .|`|s5ALY2Eoaa	Just make sure you dont break up with her...<br>  treat her with respect,<br>  dont tell her anything you dont want the  teacher to know.|`|xX7EnZsdaa	sick maybe you'll get extra credit.... :)<br>  <br>  Just be on your best behavior in school from now on.|`|AhQO6apoaa	LOL<br>  dude you are champ<br>  <br>  just change in the eyes of your teacher i guess<br>  make her think differently about you|`|JJMa25NWaa	well, doesnt everyone say their teachers hate them? i'm sure it just seems like it to you, but maybe she doesn't hate you...|`|rQf0XZfXaa	tell her mom to make her a slut so u can get some pussy tonight with your new ******* haircut|`|Joj7vRG8aa	maybe her daughter can bring you two closer|`|EOyNYpFcaa	uhmm....if u like her u shouldnt break up...<br>  bt i dont think the teacher would fail u for going out with her daughter ..|`|IiHTk7ZHaa	Well don't break up with her.<br>  Tell her the situation, be honest about it, just say I think your dad doesn't like me, I didn't know he was your dad, I have nothing against him. <br>  Ask to keep him uninformed about the situation and you'll have to be quiet for a bit until it gets serious enough.<br>  <br>  Be honest, as much as you may think daddy's girl, or something, you'll probably be surprised if she's cool with what you tell her. I'm sure she understands. Maybe she can help you like give you pointers on things you can do in class to improve things with him, how to win him over or so...|`|CRjqEUVSaa	:) haha that's funny.... Just do what you want... is it really that ackward? I was in the same sit. my bf was the son of my 1st and 2nd blocks teachers and neither of them really liked me but I'm surviving and am  friends with his parents now! Just be you self and be nice dont over try and be a brownnose but dont be a complete jerk either just give both relationships the time they need to grow and maybe you will suprise yourself and the teacher... GOOD LUCK ;)|`|Z4EBKtVQaa	Like all the other responses, I think it's cute! Oh to be young again.<br>  I'm a 45 year old mother of a 22 year old boy and a 24 year old girl, but I was younger once upon a time with a father who was very set in his ways and standards with my 2 sisters and I. Trust me when I say, we actually had boys climbing up the bricks of our house to meet with us. Needless to say I never dated until I was 18. It was then that I fell in love. AND MY BOYFRIEND RESPECTED MY DAD"S STANDARDS. <br>  If I were you, I'd go to the father and ask his permission. It's a sign of respect to him and the father will respect you back for it even if he doesn't like you and says no. If he says no, leave it be, don't go behind his back.|`|xNYUtmh8aa	Whatever you do don't break up with her!!! The teacher will make your life hell. If he hates you and your dating his daughter, i don't think he's going to hate you as much now. Or if he still openly hates you his daughter will at least like you more.|`|InlBfPM9aa	wow well maybe your teacher will be happy for her and will like you better.<br>  im sure she doesn't hate you she might dislike you a bit, if you really like the girl, id stay with it.|`|ULAjCodEaa	well i think that you should be honest and say well i think i like your daughter i am so sorry! Please give me another chance i''ll be a great guy to her!|`|PBP0jmDeaa	be nice to the girl. be nice to the teacher. take her out.<br>  ( this is freaking hilarious though :] )|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	be really nice to the teacher. and hope that you to work out because if you dump her your gonna be really hated!!!|`|61Fwbi79aa	Hey, maybe it will help out with your math grade!|`|oMj8WAHFaa	oh you too! yeah i nkow my math teacher hates me, but luckily she has no daughter, but what you need to do is explain your situation to your girl, now calm down, try to look as if you pay more attention in class, i advice switching math classes if there is another math class you can take, i am an 11 grader and so i have learned of life, also try to call private to her house so your math teacher doesn't suspect anything.|`|707gOCvbaa	I doubt your math teacher hates you unless you are a trouble maker. If you get along well with your teachers daughter then i'm sure she might see you in a different light. Be more courteous and if you do have any bad offended habits in school I suggest you change them now, esp if you want to know this girl more. good luck.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	So what take her out anyway. If the teacher sees you dating her daughter and treating her with respect, it might make her like you better.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	Just be nice to the teacher then.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Well if you don't take her out now then she is going to hate you more. So might as well see what happens.|`|BaFgY7Dcaa	Wow,that's funny. Just wing it and see how it goes.|`|fhzHiBMyaa	Don't freak out! Just because it's your teacher's daughter doesn't mean you should just freeze up. And how do you know your math teacher HATES you? You can never assume that, if they say "Be quiet." or etc. Yes, I know you instantly think, "She hates me" But just be polite to your teacher and to his/her daughter. (I don't know what gender your math teacher is)|`|HtwhcFdfaa	You seem to have rush into things a bit? (Not knowing a last name)<br>  <br>  Anyway you seem a bit young so I'm sure her mother won't have a problem with a "boyfriend" in her school years.<br>  <br>  If you're older or things are serious you'll both have to put your differences aside. Be more polite in class and see if she acts any differently.|`|htsQ6HXCaa	thats freakin awesome!!!<br>  <br>  I would love the chance to date a teachers daughter<br>  <br>  Just roll with it, and be a cocky asshole to the teacher, but treat the daughter very good and respectful.|`|QIqPwcH6aa	It's really not the end of the world, it's not like you asked her to marry you. If you feel to insecure or anxious just cancel the whole date.|`|MhzlGHkyaa	Haha, maybe you will get an A in the class for dating her daughter :)<br>  Or maybe the teacher knows that girl (the teach could be friends with the girls mom) and was just being friendly. Either way.. Good Luck!|`|atPuxNiFaa	ok if ur nice to her daughter ur teacher will be nice to u cuz if she isnt u will dump her daughter (or so she thinks) so just act like she is anybody else
POHWTDPRaa	The word Think is a bit of a red flag there. And if you can't talk with him about it, you probably shouldn't be doing it. But you don't have to bring it up. It usually just happens. If things start getting hot, just roll with it. Always have a small supply of condoms with you. Don't expect him to take care of it. And never use one he's had in his wallet. That's the worst place to store them because heat causes the rubber to wear thin, making it completely useless. You should probably think seriously about getting on the pill, too. You can never be too careful.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	Honestly, if the relationship isn't stable i don't see why you want to have sex. But i won't tell you who to have sex with, so if you really want to, either straight out tell him, or when you two are fooling around, hint at it with the things you do.|`|FF4J59pMaa	You should just start talking to him about it. If you know that you really are ready(make sure 100% that you are ready because once you start it you can't stop it) then you need to be able to talk about it freely. Tell him that you are ready to take your relationship a little step further. You can even look up things to do to get him more in the mood and maybe he will catch on. Just make sure you are ready. Don't do it because you feel pressured or anything and also think of your age. Age is a very big part of deciding on when to start having sex. Just make sure you are ready cause that is important. Hope this helps|`|7XIa76Usaa	First start taking birth control pills, condoms break. To make it more exciting and pleasing for yourself do not say anything. But you take control and make all the moves , he is your b/f enjoy him and please him by not holding anything back.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	If you are sure then go for it, just be more touchy and close to him and he will get the idea.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Age?|`|9UQlhzitaa	my dear you already have that answer you just are afraid to answer it<br>  <br>  ok try this on for size and see if it fits<br>  <br>  your love to each other is a gift given from you to him and returned the same way (at least i hope it is equally if not more)<br>  <br>  so how do you want to give the one person who has become so important to you. The greatest gift he can ever receive from you. if you are like most girls/woman i have known in my life .Then you will be giving him all of you heart,mind.body<br>  <br>  now i can't say for him but for most of us guys it is not on those levels that the act of sex hits on but more to fulfilling a need or want that by it we say we care about you plus it feels great to us<br>  <br>  now not all of us are like that or stay that way.In time i learned what it means to a woman to say here i am .I leave myself vulnerable to you by this act<br>  <br>  one other thing; if you too do have sex it has been proven that right after intercourse we are on your normal emotional level. So that is when you want to talk to him and get answers to any questions<br>  <br>  hope you can find your answer now|`|K1Uvl2kXaa	how old are you?? since i haven't fallen in love, im not ready. im waiting until i have true love because its a hundred times better(my mother says and she isn't keeping me back from having it) so if i was in love right now, then i would be doing it so i suppose then if your in love then do it. but make sure you're safe because there is consequences.|`|vxjOpKruaa	You should start talking about more openly and freely and he may start to figure out whats up.<br>  <br>  If he seems uncomfortable talking about it or if he does and you find out that he doesn't want to have sex then you should wait maybe another year.|`|ze4Gt1araa	If you want to and you feel that your ready than go for it.<br>  <br>  And you don't need to bring it up when your alone with him just start kissing him and get on top of him and that will lead to temptation and temptation will lead to have sex lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	if you were ready to have sex, you would be ready to talk to him about it|`|wYTDwWnEaa	I wouldnt if i were you. If you guys have an "on again, off again" kind of relationship then thats a bad idea. He'll dump you after he gets some.. duh.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	If you do not really want to, then don't.|`|2H14Bf9oaa	get married....|`|JZYsFg4Raa	Well, I am not sure if you are in fact ready to have sex. But, if you are you really need to make sure that you know each other's sexual history, safety precautions and your expectations going in. You know just sit him down and explain how you feel and what you are thinking. Of course, it won't be the most comfortable conversation the two of you will ever had, but it is one that you should have before you decide to have sex. Laying it all out open and honestly lets you know where you stand and how you should proceed. You can start off with something like, "We have been dating off and on for 2 years and we really love each other. I think we have reached a point where we can explore the physical side of our relationship", or something to that effect...Just make sure you are really ready|`|qMsWcfNXaa	i think u shouldn't have sex because u said it on and off relationship. and if u think hes the one u wanna hav sex with then all i gotta say is wear a condom. I think all guys hav sex on their mind, when u guys start kissing i think u should start there and whisper something into his ear and kiss and that will lead into it. in the bedroom of course. Be safe|`|gEfWYFcyaa	Well how old are you first of all?<br>  And when your getting steamy making out and etc. just whisper in his ear "i think im ready" see how he reacts, if its positive take it from there and if not just shrug it off like you got too carried away.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	if it is " safe " than it isnt real . so , go the extra 9 yards and figure him out before you decide that he is safe but sex isnt , it wasnt designed to be .|`|QKFMbJqlaa	make sure ur relationship is stable before u jump into things to quickly try communicating with him.<br>  if u really r ready for something this serious don't beat around the bush when talking to him about it it's better to be open and honest about this|`|2sgYribSaa	Do it.

umhMpKz7aa	i agree with the others. there are lots of ways to have an "o" without him and with him at the same time. however, my advice would be to start exploring all the things that he would like to see, because maybe watching you...would give him satisfaction and you too. be creative ( i do mean only with your husband) but check out adult toys they can be pleasureable for both. i know it is a painful subject and for a woman an emotional, self esteem one too. i hope you have already ruled out medical problems and drug solutions for him. it is a huge issue in a marriage, but i know can be worked out. good luck.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	Some men suffer from impedance. This can be very traumatizing to them. It can be caused by medications and so he should have himself checked. This then leads to not being interested in sex not because he doesn't want to have it but because he simply can't. This is something that should be discussed just be careful and be patient with him. As husband and wife you should never be afraid to talk about anything that has to do with sex. There are many things he can do so not all hope is lost. The key is to talk to him with lots of love and patients. Don't wait till you had enough and your patients has been exhausted. Some people automatically express divorce as an Option. Love can concur if it is given a chance. I hope all works out.|`|4xZytkilaa	Drop me a line. lol|`|th7C1aoaaa	I'd go with the hugh jelly vibrator.

Bring him a picture of you two together and set it where he can see it and remember the wonderful times you spent together. Do not be afraid to reminese about funny times and special things he did for you. Good luck sweetie, I hope he does not suffer much.

The kids get the house and each of you are allowed to live there for three weeks, than switch.<br>  <br>  <br>  It’s a form of access or custody where the children stay in the former family residence and it is the parents who rotate in and out separately and on a negotiated schedule.<br>  <br>  The children simply live at "home" and the separated or divorced parents take turns living with them there, but never at the same time.<br>  <br>  The core element of this arrangement is that each parent maintains a separate residence where they live when it is not their turn at the "bird's nest". When one parent arrives for his/her designated time, the other vacates right away, so as to minimize or eliminate the presence of both at the same time.<br>  <br>  At times, bird's nest access can be coupled with specified access with the other parent say, for example, for dinner one night a week.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, this form of access or custody will end when the youngest child reaches the age of majority at which time, one parent either buys the other out of their interest, if any, in the former family residence, or it is sold and the proceeds divided pursuant to the matrimonial property regime or separation agreement.<br>  <br>  The arrangement can be expensive as it generally requires that three separate residences be maintained, the "nest" and a separate residence for each parent.<br>  <br>  The concept is somewhat novel and appears to have as its origin a Virginia case Lamont v Lamont.<br>  In Canada, Greenough v Greenough was a ground-breaker case in that the Court implemented a bird's nest custody order even though it had not been asked for by either party. Justice Quinn, in Greenough stated:<br>  <br>  "In Lamont ... the court made a bird’s nest custody arrangement in which the children (aged 3 and 5 years) remained in the home, with the mother staying in the home during the week and the father on the weekend. I think that the benefits of a bird’s nest order are best achieved where the children are able to stay in the matrimonial home, particularly if it has been the only residence that they have known....<br>  <br>  "Time and time again I have seen cases (and this is one) where the children are being treated as Frisbees. In general, parents do not seem to appreciate the gross disruption to which children are subjected where one of the parents has frequent access. In this regard, I do not believe there must be evidence that the children are suffering before the court is free to act. To me, it is a matter of common sense. At the risk of falling prey to simplistic generalities, I am of the view that, given a choice, I do not see why anyone would select a living arrangement which involved so much movement from house to house."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <br>  The biggest hurdle is finding an attorney who works for you and not to just drain your wallet.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.

No lunch, because after the chat you'll both go back to work and feel uncomfortable. Invite her to dinner or after work drinks.  Start your conversation with an apology, let her know that you really want to make the work place kinder for you and her.  Open up to her, let her see the human side of you, don't be accusatory or defensive.   Help her to understand that you want to be a team player, I think she'll in return show appreciation of your hard work and hopefully you'll both let bygones be bygones and start fresh.|`|rawz0RJuaa	report her to the labor board. what she is doing, she can get in a lot of trouble for. especially if you have a co worker who can back you up. <br>  i dont know what your job is or the company you work for, but this is all i can tell you.|`|iD4ejChZaa	she doesn't have Jesus in her life or her heart wouldn't be so hard, sin makes her so mean.

No one should have to work in an environment like that. If you cannot change jobs to get away from this, I would start keeping a journal. Every day log in what is going on and be specific. Let your boss properly know when a situation is unacceptable. Should you ever come to a point when the working condition becomes unbearable and it comes time to bring your boss up on charges, you will have evidence in your journal.|`|3iNobwVraa	Wow, that sounds pretty miserable.  I'm so sorry for you.  I can't tell you if your boss will change; I can tell you, however, that if she does, it probably won't be in response to something you've done or said.  People learn patterns of behavior, and hers seems firmly entrenched, imo.  <br>  <br>  So what can you do?  Well, I wouldn't spend too much time focusing on her behavior, because you can't change that.  You can, however, learn something about yourself.  Accept this reality: you teach people how to treat you.  It's difficult--but not impossible--to change patterns you have aleady (mistakenly) developed.  But, you can only do this when both people are vested in the relationship.  Since that doesn't seem to be the case here, you can only reflect on your own behavior and try to understand what part you played in this dynamic.<br>  <br>  In non-intimate relationships (i.e. not friends or loved ones,) I almost always let them catch a glimpse of the ***** I can be.  This is good for them, because they won't end up caught off guard, and thoroughly unprepared by that side of me should they choose to ignite it, and it is good for me, because it pre-empts any notion that I will ever play doormat to someone else's games.<br>  <br>  My motto is, you don't have to BE a b*tch, but you better know how to wear the hat.  By this, I mean, that you don't have to choose to be hard, all the time, but if it is necessary, you can hold your own in any situation.  Honestly, these situatons guide you and teach you how to function in a world that isn't always going to be kind.  These situations are helping you strengthen your backbone, and design your ****** hat.  Try it on, learn what it feels like, get comfortable with the fit.  Then put it away, knowing you can pull it out when you need to.<br>  <br>  In future situations, whenever appropriate, give people a glimpse of the b*tch hat before you ever have reason to wear it.  This can be as simple as standing stock still and silently watching someone for a few seconds too long when they make a comment that is inappropriate.  You would be surprised how effective this can be because we are all, always, guaging others for information about how they expect to be treated.  Experiment, and learn about yourself.  The appropriate focus here is internal.  Nothing else will help you change the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|egpVC6uMaa	As long as she remains your boss, it will not get better.

CceiP7q5aa	noo course not|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Haley....<br>  <br>  You see....what I've always told you, the girl "Mackdill" and the one "above me" said the same thing...with the "attitude & inner tube" that was sooo cutely out...I like that ! And furthermore:<br>  <br>  <br>   Haley...the problem with "Cellulite" is really something you CAN'T help, baby, because it's an accumulation of water in your cells and let me tell you this : All the products the market offers you (for big time money) are "money thrown out the window" because NONE of the creams, gels, etc. will help any !!!<br>  <br>  This water storage accumulation in your connective tissue will not (totally) "disappear", so you should "make friends" with it. You can reduce it by exercising and if you can get one of those massaging-"gloves" ...I don't know the exact terminology..I mean, how you call those rough type gloves(with such "nobs") you use to massage your skin with..You know, which ones I mean??? -smile-<br>  <br>  To answer your Q.: NO way does it make you "ugly", because you can't help for that stupid Cellulite (I've got it myself)....What makes someone "ugly" is a negative attitude, bad character, etc. but never something you didn't cause yourself !!!<br>  <br>  Send you all my love & care (as always)...Love ya' Haley !!!|`|FF4J59pMaa	I know I'm not a guy but no it doesn't! I think that it is personality that counts not just looks. Of course you have to be attracted to the person but don't be superficial either. Everybody hass their flaws. I look at personality and if they have an awesome personality it makes them even more attractive cause who wants to be with this hot muscular guy if he has nothing in his head and no personality?|`|ajgC0KPhaa	No.<br>  Obviously it would look weird/unappealing, but it wouldn't make her ugly. That word should be saved for her face, and more importantly, her personality.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|yyvcryrbaa	no.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nope... only she is the one that REALLY notices it... and stresses herself...|`|mLU3DkTKaa	attitude that dont match the innertube is what makes us alll ugly , trust me , there are men , good solid men , in this world who think there is nothing sexier , it is just a matter of not being afraid to admit that that was who you were built for .|`|LW7Taqskaa	I know the question is for the guys, but i'm bi sexual and if i liked a girl, i wouldn't give a crap if she had cellulite or not... if your personality is good, then believe me huni, everything about you is gorgeous..|`|MlyqlmTgaa	no lol. even trackstars have cellulite. it's normal, and doesnt make you ugly. a great figure of someone who's in shape is really attractive. if it bothers you, drink lots of water to flush it out and wear jeans or maybe tights.|`|n8MnzRp1aa	this makes me feel horrible lol......CELLULETTES NOTHING!!! i just had a baby and got stretch marks allll over......you'll have bigger problems....dont sweat the small things.|`|VMoDsdREaa	no we all have flaws honey, so it does not make you any less beautiful cause you already are beautiful.|`|DCcumpkOaa	nah|`|xp9IMoWEaa	depends on her face, but no
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Rock on mom!!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I wouldn't call it disgusting...just pretty dumb on your Mom's part. Very few 25 year old guys are with an older woman because they're in love with her. More likely, he's after money, and he probably makes her feel good about herself. SHe'll find out the hard way, unfortunately.|`|AA11356977	Open that mind of yours! Im 45 and my guy of 5 years is 23. We are very happy and live together  with my 2 kids that have no issue with it becasue I raised them to be open minded. You are limiteing your happiness by shutting different ideas out. We look great together.|`|AA11599430	eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|`|JUEkTETAaa	well don't be mad but happy for her .....people like each other no matter what age, race, or creed|`|8DhmRwMraa	OMGG WOOW YEAHH!!!!!!!!!!|`|PZ52akGtaa	Well, seeing as I can say in my honest opinion as a man, the largest age difference I would even consider is 7 years, nothing more than that. So yes, that is a little bit sick. She is way to old to have a boyfriend that young. I am unsure what would even compel a man that young to go out with some one who is that much older than him (not calling your mother that old).|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Do you think a 43yo guy and a 25yo girl is disgusting? Younger women like older guys and older women like younger guys...Get over it.|`|OX5IqYndaa	not really i mean i have a friend hows mom is like that but they r married and they r on the way to a new little one|`|6ErVPePEaa	Age is nothing but a number. Maybe they have a lot in common and really enjoy each others company.. It is not disgusting|`|LRF70DMjaa	It's not just you.  It's down right dirty.|`|qvT36vnKaa	that's nasty !!!|`|hWMweOZmaa	yes!
vOomJtbsaa	Offer up your credit or debit card to the server/waitor before they bring the tab.  Sneak off the restroom and just hand your card off to them, ask them to please take care of the tab on your card before even bringing the tab to the table.  Then when they bring the tab back to the table you sign away and look across at your guests and say.... "You guys always treat and we really wanted to treat you to a night out this time, hope thats okay!"   Should work out.  That will get the point across that sometimes you intend to pay.  If they take offense to it, then say something along the lines of "Why would you feel offended allowing us to treat you sometimes, when you generally treat us and expect us to not feel offended?"  It's short and sweet and firm enough to get your point across, however it's not rude or spiteful.   Hope this helps!|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	Be nice, but firm.  Say no (at the time when it comes to pay), and be swift about getting your money out.  Absolutely do not cave in, no matter what.  Explain that it is not right that they keep treating you, and you must return the favour.  Don't worry, keep smiling, and it should be fine.|`|eZKmubDBaa	Youth is wasted on the young|`|kdSuwt8paa	Offer to pay.   When they say no just say quietly "We would really like to pay - at the very least for ourselves - and it will spoil the evening if you don't let us".  If that doesn't work next time they ask you out say "No thank you, until you let us pay our way we feel bad about going out with you."|`|PLbmKNpvaa	*wink* I say don't. Obviously they enjoy spoiling you and find it offensive that their well-meaning behaviour is not being taken the way they think it should. Clearly you appreciate what they're doing, I can tell that by the way you talk. But THEY don't seem to realise that it makes you feel a little anxious. So if it were me, I wouldn't ask them to stop, I'd simply start treating them as often as they do you. Go up and pay for the meal before you're even done on the pretence or going to the bathroom. My hubby does this with over-generous friends all the time. That way we don't feel bad, and they realise that we appreciate their gestures. And if they say anything about it, simply say "Well, we felt uncomfortable that you do nice things for us all the time and wanted to even the score. The bill is paid and they won't give it back now so you might as well enjoy not paying for dinner for once instead of having a more empty wallet because you're too nice!" lol. Good luck with it :)|`|trhMszD1aa	you put it accross very nicely here so why not just say the same thing to them??|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Well... it sounds like they really want to... That makes it hard!     You need to be upfront and honest with them before the trip. Let them know how you feel. They can't be mad at you for being honest can they?
JtEBaOdjaa	I think a tote bag with The New Mrs. Smith on it would be cute.  Make sure it's visible at the airport and when you check into the hotel.  If they see it they may give you an upgrade for being on your honeymoon (if they don't see it, try to mention it's your honey moon) lol.<br>  <br>  The shirt might be a little much. I think those shirts are cute for bridal showers/bachelorette parties or getting ready the day of the wedding.  For a honeymoon, I'd go with the tote.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	I really like the idea, but I did it a little differently. I didnt like the "soon to be" or "The new.." because you can only wear them for a while. I bought a black zip up jacket that has "Mrs. Smith" on the back. I can wear it even now... and I've been married for almost two years. I didnt want to spend money on something I could only wear before the wedding or only while we were newlyweds.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i think if thats what melts your butter then go for it! who cares if it is tacky (which im not saying it is - im just saying who cares) <br>  <br>  personally i think its kinda over the top - for me - but i can see it working especially if the bag was dont in your wedding colors|`|AA11082914	Cute for something to wear around the house, tacky to wear on the honeymoon. (People are going to be able to tell you're newlyweds...lol. Don't ask me how, they just know...lol.)|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Hate them!<br>  <br>  These items have a limited time span.  How long will you carry something that says "bride" or "future anything"?<br>  <br>  If you want a nice tote bag get something with your new monogram on it.  It will be sophisticated and understated.  I highly recommend LL Bean boat and tote bags.  They last forever and can be personalized.|`|73fuqfSyaa	I think it will be very cute. My fiance, for Christmas, bought me a white hoodie, with (soon to be mrs. **********) embroidered in black on the back. It was very cute and thoughtful of him. I am sure you can find something tasteful and adorable to do that would absolutely fit you.|`|nBjQQ3yraa	I think they are cute.  I saw a couple on an airplane with Bride and Groom shirts on.  The bride was hungover and threw up and fell asleep on the plane.  I hope the rest of the honeymoon was better.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	If done tastefully, it would be okay|`|ODYrypwaaa	I love them!  I did it for underwear, totes, shirts, cups.  I really like it.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Soon to be....Cool. The new.....not.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Childish and attention-seeking, frankly.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I think they're odd, personally, and thus a waste of money. But to each their own.

Isn't that's why your here on Y!A ? Post what it is that's bothering you or send an email to someone, even me, and you may get the understanding you seek.|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	Yeah, that's happened pretty often lately.  That's why I keep so much inside.  Sometimes other people just aren't enough and you just have to find your own answers.  I hope you are able to find those answers, sweetie.  Still, let me know if you ever need to talk.  ((((((angel))))))|`|JnKD0NU8aa	Iv had that, and most of the time i go on google to see what others would have said, or i hold it in....<br>  But if your really stuck and need to talk to somebody talk to somebody you dont know...<br>  I usually go on www.habbo.co.uk and ask a friend on there :)|`|5EfJu34taa	ya i was in that situation recently.i talked with my god then.its the best solution.he even listens peacefully & sometimes even gives you solutions.try it.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Sometimes I just do the talking to clear up how I think about it....... even if I doubt what I am saying is being empathetically comprehended.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Like how burnt Cheese-Whiz is yummy when you pick it off the jar?<br>  I get all sorts of strange looks on that one. <br>  <br>  I understand. <br>  <br>  Hope ya get it worked out FA.|`|YIAZmSW7aa	Yes.

AA10197672	You tell him how you did not appreciate the fact that he lied and lies always come out one way or another... tell him this better be the last time he lies to you, otherwise you are going ot have to end it. If you love him you owe to yourself to give hi m another chance and if he crosees that line again, then you know you did everything you could and he failed....|`|2eoAqicdaa	He's probally ashamed of his job... being a cleaner is mainly for woman and he's probally embarrassed about it...<br>  My ex done that he lied to me he said he worked in an office when really he worked as a warehouse cleaner and him lying to me really annoyed me too! but i guess it doesnt seem to be very 'man-ly' of them to have a female job <br>  Tell him that you know in a calm way and dont show him that your annnoyed just be civil about it... he'll open up to you and will tell you the real reason why|`|hs793CCxaa	You sound very young.....<br>  <br>  Maybe there was a reason he told you that. Find out all about it before you consider jumping ship, though, by the sound of things, you will be doing him a favor.<br>  <br>  I bet you only tell him "little lies" and they are ok in your opinion......|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I know it's not right that he lied to you but are you absolutely positive that your dad's friend is not the one who's mistaking?  If he would have said he was a doctor or something, I could see the big problem but I don't see a big difference between the two jobs.  Is it possible that he does both?  I live in Canada and at our hospital they have all kinds of titles like sanitation engineer for janitor, etc.  Maybe you should ask him questions about his job before a big confrontation.  It's possible that he loves you so much that he didn't want to lose you by saying he was a cleaner.  It doesn't make it right if he lied but for all I know, it could really be your father's friend who's wrong|`|dbQHlp85aa	I wouldn't leave him for that. He probably doesn't want you to know what he does maybe because he's ashamed of it.. but with today's times, he should be very proud that he works at all. <br>   <br>  I do think that getting engaged after only 5 months is too soon when obviously there's still much to learn.. even with a long engagement. <br>  <br>  The engagement is not the time to talk about money, housing, children, goals and such.. all of this should be discussed before getting engaged. <br>  <br>  I would hold off on getting married and take a little more time to get to know each other. I would definitely not be so angry about this until you find out why he lied.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	I dunno whether you should end it, only u can decide that, u need to speak to him and ask him why he has lied, and I would probably say, he only said it, cos he was embarrassed about what is job was, and the longer he lied, the harder it was for him to come clean (sorry no pun intended lol) about it. I know hes lied, and they say a lie is a lie however big or small it is, but its up to u whether u give him another chance, and decide if u can trust him from now on|`|AA11706291	Yeah he couldn't even come clean about his job, what else has he lied to you about.|`|81wvN8Rraa	End it now  if he is lying about stuff like that it will only get worse.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Look when he first met you he didn't know it was going to turn serious and it's clearly obvious why he lied. He is embarrassed about his job and is probably dreading the day you find out. Yes he shouldn't have lied but if he hasn't with anything else then cut the guy some slack. He will probably be relieved now you know after he's got over the embarrassment. Least he gets off his ar*e and works whatever it is.|`|iD4ejChZaa	the dude has an honorable job, he is a contributing, productive member of society, he provides a service to his community. he has nothing at all to be ashamed of [like the owner of a strip club or something]<br>     too bad he felt he couldn't be honest with you, too bad he felt embaressed. as your fiance you should build him up with words,<br>  he works, he doesn't sit around collecting free money like some bum.<br>  if you would dump him then you're not the girl for him.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	if he has lied to you now,he'll lie to you again..<br>  Once they start lying,they don't stop.<br>  Same goes with cheating: once a cheater,always a cheater.<br>  Once a woman-beater,always a woman-beater.|`|n8lXItGraa	Don't play games...Tell him what you know, and ask him why he lied.  he may have been embarrassed to tell you what he did for a living.  Seeing as you're getting married...maybe it's time for full disclosure!  give him the space to tell you what you want to know.  And no....you shouldn't end it because of this.  Hope this helps...|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Maybe he's a security guard that has to clean.  When you see him tonight ask him exactly what he does but not in accusatory way.  There's a chance that your dad's friend's information is incorrect and that your b/f didn't lie so don't judge yet.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Yes, you will never be able to trust him!  Not to mention, you haven't known him long enough to even be engaged to him!|`|JDUhhAQyaa	End it ! as there will be lie after lie with that one..|`|AA10240683	Talk to him first. Ask why he did not want to admit it. There could be an underlining story to this.|`|WA8feS8taa	To be honest, you can't trust him. If he lied to you about something like his job, which is a huge part of someones life, there's no telling what else he might lie to you about when you get married. <br>  <br>  Talk to him tonight and make him tell you that he's really a cleaner, don't fall into his trap though. And by that I mean he'll try to sweet talk you and tell you he lied to you for the right reasons. But in all honesty, there's no lie in the world that could ever be right.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	I wouldn't end it. I would just talk to him about it cause he was probably nervous or embarrassed to tel you he is a cleaner and not a security guard.I wouldn't leave him over something like that. It shouldn't matter what somebody does for a living when you are gonna be getting married to the guy. If that was the case I would have never married my husband cause he was getting paid to take care of his grandfather! At the time I was a PCA worker too. So it shouldn't matter what he does for a living.|`|jLKcuMNraa	he could have been in security when you first met him and then he got a new job. just ask him about it|`|3qUvC6Draa	surprise surprise.<br>  <br>  his a cleaner- with the current situation were all in.<br>  ill congratulate him for even having a job.<br>  <br>  im 19 years old- on track- full time university student looking around for a job cant seem to find one.<br>  <br>  coming back to your question the ladies have one problem. this problem is coming to conclusions without thinking.<br>  <br>  talk to him- if he confesses that indeed you are right and he lied.<br>  see the way he says it, body language- the way he says it from there judge if you want to live with this guy any longer.<br>  <br>  has he lied before, if not you may be wrong.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	I am sure he only lied to you because he felt insecure about his job title.  No, I wouldn't end it..but you do need to let him know that lying is no way to start a relationship and keep the trust in the relationship.  Just let him know that will let this one go..but in the future it is very important that you have complete honesty.  Don't attack him when you comfront...just so he doesn't feel stupid, you know?  Men don't take that to well, believe me...Also, let him know that he doesn't HAVE to lie to you..that you except him just the way he is.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	i understand that he lied to you but i'm sure he thought it may bother you and he was embaressed! ovbiously you are holding that to an excuse bc if you truly loved him you wouldnt care if he worked at mc donalds!! Im sure you can understand why he hid it! Also if you dnt knw what work he really does and you are too marry him?! Ha people like you make me sick! you take marriage as a joke! Why dont you try to get to know one another before you rush into marriage then maybe the chances of it lasting will improve!!|`|NGKwsawdaa	I'm sure he lied bc he was embarrassed to tell you he was a cleaner, I'm sure he didn't do it to hurt you. I would sit down with him and tell he that you don't care what profession he has, as long as he doesn't lie and is a good man. But no I would leave him over that.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I'd end it. Engaged after 5 months? Yikes. You should always date someone for all 4 seasons before you even think of getting engaged. People usually plan every detail of their wedding but rarely plan the marriage. You already learned something big. He is a liar and doesn't trust you with the truth.|`|egpVC6uMaa	You barely know this man that you are about to marry...why don't you take some more time and get to know him, before you commit to marrying him? Maybe five months isn't really enough time..<br>  <br>  Don't be so fast to end it, take some more time and get to know him. Then you will know if you want to go through with it or not...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	erm..No. There are worst thing then lieing about a job but its kind of rushing into marriage dont you think? You've been together for 5 months and your getting married? Whats the rush? Just shows your not ready for marriage. He cant even tell you his real job? Weird relationship.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Well firstly he was probably too embarrassed to tell you the truth. At least hes working so hes not a layabout. Id talk to him about lying to you but It doesnt seem like grounds to leave him. Or is it that you want to leave him and you are just looking for an excuse|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Thats a big lie, especially for that long and he never came clean to you. How long were you with him not to know what he does.. Not sure if you should end it, but than again he's starting your lives together in a lie already.. thats a head scratcher =o|`|qSvOxfw1aa	Give him the opportunity to discuss it with you. If you feel you can let it go, then stay with him. Put the wedding on hold until you are sure you can forgive his lie.|`|PQwRl27Jaa	no u should not leave him because some time men lie when the like or love a girl n dont think girls will go out with thembecause of the y life style, job or how the life style, u should tell him that u did not likethat he lied 2 u n ask him not 2 lie again.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	He probably lied because he was embarrassed. Don't end it with him, work through it.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	i dont think you should. just talk to him about it.|`|Jii448d2aa	I'm sure there are a lot of things you don't know about him and vise versa, only being together for 5 months. I'm with you with him being a cleaner not being that big of a deal but if he did lie about it what else is lying about? I think you should take it step by step with him now, holding off the marriage until you really know this man. Good luck with the talk, I wouldn't hide it from him that you know, thats your right being his future wife, I would stress to him the trust that he has just broken over something so minor. You, yourself should decide if this is something and someone worth spending the rest of your life with.|`|JnKD0NU8aa	Ok you love him right, and he loves you and your going to be spending the rest of your lives together...<br>  I dont think a little thing like this should spoil your relationship, something like his already married or his seeing somebody else then yes you should end it...<br>  But maybe his told you he has a diffrent job because being a cleaner is a womans job really and he may want to look better infront of you...<br>  Just tell him you know and let him know you was hurt about him lying.. your in a relationship you should be able to talk to him about your feelings...<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope iv helped x|`|WUzRFv9Aaa	I don't think you should end it, when I first got with my husband he lied to me and said he was only a few years older but ended up being 9 years, he lied because he thought if i knew I wouldn't of got with him its probably he same with your boyfriend he felt you may be would have felt different towards him if you knew from the start of the relationship  and wouldn't of like him, basically he felt ashamed of his job and couldn't say|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	maybe he didn't think that you would want to be with him if you knew but i can see where the lien would worry you because after this he could continue lien about other things and he could already be lien about other things but if you ask him and he tells you the truth from the start give him another chance but if he continues to lie  tell him that you are gonna stop by his job tomorrow and see what he says once you settle this follow your heart because only you know whats best for you and i know that leaving him is hard but if that's what you feel as if you need to do then do it because you don't need a man that's going to lie  to you because you are better than that|`|JgvQDjf2aa	How shallow are you? Leave him because of something that trivial. My god I thought I'd hear about another girl or a secret child. lol! Guys are very prideful by nature and maybe he just insn't ready to see the look on your face when he says "Hey baby, I'm a janitor" not nearly as appealing as a sequrity guard. Although we women can love a man no matter what he does They can feel less worthy even if it is caused by a job. This is so small let him bring it to you when he feels he can, because judging by your response here I don't blame him for lying. Maybe you made him feel he had to. 5 months is a very young relationship, don't push to hard.|`|dd78df2787519f32b158b8d222e23f95aa	Wait... You get engaged to a guy that you'll only known for 5 months? You don't even know what he does for a living but you are willing to spend your whole life with him?!?!  <br>  <br>  Well honestly that's what the engagement is for; good thinking make it a whole year and 1/2, now you know... either you two can work passed it or you can dump him.
MWWUPWNiaa	Guys tend to comment on something without sounding caring because that would ruin their reputation as a DUDE.=) It took everything in him to comment you like that and he meant it in the most sincere way. He THINKS YOU ARE GOOD at dancing. By saying even better then you he is implying that your hard to live up to. Hes giving you a GREAT compliment. Take it, take him and fly away with it =]|`|UEiKub2Haa	haha i agree with erica ! if he was trying to give you a compliment or anything he would have said that you were as good as or better ! he was definitely being sarcastic i mean you cant blame him if you always say that . even from this question you seem a little cocky about this :/ but its good to have confidence in yourself :) ..you wanted the truth so there it is ..sorry its a little harsh hun xox|`|9d8u0rqOaa	even better than you with a question mark or even better than you period?<br>  <br>  First one does imply that your a great dancer, second one is a dis.|`|5xmrDavqaa	I think that's exactly what he was implying.  Next time somebody says something like that... you should ask them what they meant.|`|t2W9GGjdaa	He thinks you are good, but she's better.|`|lmpBv7xgaa	Yes.  He says you're  really good dancer.  Take that as a compliment!!!  <3|`|GlhPkCuqaa	Yes.|`|UTGDIOsOaa	idk wat implying means lol|`|hKDmHqAdaa	yes|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	yes, he meant that you are a good dancer.|`|zPLza1dSaa	He is replying that your good but<br>  not as good as him/she. So yeah she/him<br>  is saying ur really good but not better than<br>  him/she.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Yeah, cause he said 'even'.  If he left out the 'even' he'd be implying you're not so good.  But since he said even better than you, that means he thinks you're really good.  You should audition for "So you think you can dance".|`|da8d3fa7a075907fff1a655c9a107079aa	Well he could...but..he could also be being sarcastic seeing as you go on and on about how good you are...|`|OMy8q6kgaa	So it would seem!|`|22ef69433e60cdfed095dc6ca07e1bbcaa	im guessing he was|`|oU1yUxwwaa	I think that he was saying that he thinks you are an okay dancer. I don't think he was saying you are a good dancer. He was saying that whoever was dancing was better at it than you. It was a backhand compliment. <br>  <br>  For example: if someone was to compliment your hair by saying, "Your hair looks nice but hers looks better". Okay that means whoever complimented you canceled out the compliment they gave by saying that someones elses looks better. <br>  <br>  That means you were complimented but it was quickly canceled out.|`|w2HZulWkaa	that was a jerk-ish way to say itt..<br>  but he most likely means:<br>  she is a really good dancer.<br>  plain and simple<br>  now you could obviously say..<br>  well he probably meant if shes better at least im good<br>  and you could be right<br>  but from what he said..im impossible to get a full thought of what he was actually trying to say.<br>  if you really want to know: talk to him<br>  hope i helped!|`|RezEkwMOaa	Yes haha obviously.<br>  <br>  answer mine please..?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AokdU8b9hbBY7sN_krgNQjrD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220145911AAbeX0h">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oSRVsV3naa	heyy ya he was plz !! answer mine ik your not a guy but maybe you know <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao67gTzYqDwsGr6K84YMSArsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220145753AADgqFG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vMthRkrsaa	Yeah. good dancer and terrible speller.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	he was implying that your a little bit cocky about how good of a dancer you are :) he was poking fun at ya|`|zfKzLFgxaa	hmmmm i think its more like he was making fun of you cuz he knows you always say that youre a good dancer.... not in a mean way, but just to be kinda funny :/|`|cn1jWO4Haa	most likely, i think.
dBDxfrLFaa	if she likes you back ask her out  if she does not like you back then ask her to just be friends|`|ytl2PONXaa	You ask...    She says yes/no    If yes, bring to movies.    If no, just leave her alone.|`|XuNF6uv5aa	hang out with her
XL1evQBRaa	Yeah, i certainly think he has no right in doing this. He can't be this protective over you for a life long duration. Its unfair and its basically hacking into your own private space.<br>  <br>  I don't actually know what you should do about the situation, except explain you're not hiding anything, you just want your own space and privacy.<br>  <br>  Dads certainly don't understand the young female mind, so try and approach him and explain.<br>  <br>  If not, avoid asking personal questions online, and go to a friend. He can't check up then!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|8ZmjIYORaa	In a way, they are being protective, just incase they think you are talking to someone you shouldn't be or other, but in other words, don't run off and cry, tell him whilst he's looking why you don't want him to.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped :).<br>  Advice can be as simple as 2 sentences :)|`|n8MnzRp1aa	MY MOM USED TO SNOOP TOO! i hated it. we never got along.<br>  <br>  i dont think he's right for doing it. He should trust you.<br>  OR<br>  he just shoulda waited till you were done and then went look when you would'nt have known....i think that woulda been wrong too lol|`|JUYjyP0xaa	create a new account with a new password.|`|RPoFBenJaa	i think instead of freaking out and crying you have just told you father about the "girly" stuff. I think you are trying to justify that you may have been hiding something. If it was something girly, you need to remember, he has seen all that stuff already since the day you were born. You would have been more embarrassed. Not hysterical. Either way, he has the right to do it.|`|SA2PGI3Qaa	This is very wrong, would you look through someones diary? No.<br>  It's nothing to do with him and everyone deserves there privacy so talk to him or get your mum to, That was very wrong.|`|6ZtoLkfPaa	i think your dads really mean for doing that. if i had a dad then id kick him in the balls or somthing to get my own back, lol|`|BrYy57yTaa	good passwords do wonders|`|AA11280073	He is an adult and your parent. He has full control of the computer and everything you do. If you didn't want him to see your messages, you shouldn't have written them.|`|AA10531094	Yes, he does have the right to look at your "personal stuff." You're a minor living with your parents, so everything that comes in and out rather it's via the internet, cell phone, mail, etc., they have a right.  It's really for your protection, not necessarily snooping for the hell of it.  Your young now, but when you become an adult and have your own children, you'll understand.  Good Luck!

I would spent some time trying to figure out what it is that is making you feel smothered and trapped. Then talk to him about it. He might be able to offer you the reassurance you need. It's easy to over-think things if you don't voice concerns out lout, I believe. <br>  <br>  I don't know. For me, marriage wasn't that "different." We loved each other before we were married, and after we were married it became a wonderful opportunity to spend more time with the person I still loved. One day in a white dress and tux won't turn you into different people. <br>  <br>  This article recommends some valuable resources for learning about having a healthy marriage and finding marriage advice. You might give them a try.|`|99teIRU7aa	If you truely love him, marry him. He loves you, he will take care of you for a lifetime! If you dont truely and 100% love him, talk to him.|`|AA10840325	I know exactly how you feel. I'm just like that, scared to commit to anything. We're supposed to get married in September and along with all of this doubt an ex boyfriend showed up and he was my first love. I don't know what to do. This just complicated  things more. I don't have an answer for you but I do feel the same way and I don't know what to do. Hope everything works out for you though.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	there is absoultly no reason to rush things! If everything is great then prolong the wedding! things can only get better and when your ready to make that step you will be very excited! this is a sign that your not quite ready, and its ok. It doesnt mean you dont love him!!|`|tT04bRLraa	this is too important of a decision for anyone to make for you. theres really nothing anyone can say. all im going to tell you is that you need to trust ur own gut and feelings, if hes right for you and ur guna be together forever you will be together forever. that simple. 1 suggestion. you should try living together alone before marriage. my cousin did what ur doing and wanted to wait and such and it backfired. you should honestly try being married before actually being married. sorry if that doesnt make sense. i hope u get it. but thats all i can tell you. you need to do what u want to do
XiCGpIx3aa	Yes, someone else will come along.  I thought I lost my only true love and then five years later the real true love came into my life.  I thought the first one was really it.  Now that I have seen true love for the last 16 years there is no comparison.  Looking back I am glad the first one broke up with me.    Take some time.  You lost something very important to you.  Almost like a loss from a death.  But it will get better.  And another will come along.|`|AA10682405	I'm so sorry to hear that.  Well, it sounds like there was something lacking in the relationship if she left you. At least for her, and you want to be with somebody who is just as into you as you are into them.  Of course when you are with somebody that long, you see your future together, but I do truly believe that everything happens for a reason. If it wasn't meant to be with her, there will be somebody else, in time. If she wasn't willing to work things out between you, you want somebody who will.   You never want to be giving more in a relationship than you are getting, because you won't be truly happy.  Just wait it out, and you will find somebody who you prove to be better for you. Learn from this experience and apply what you learned next time. Think of what was wrong in your relationship, and make sure it doesn't happen with the next person. Communication is key in relationships.  Again, I'm so sorry to hear about this, but keep your head high and everything will work out the way it should.|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Sources say ask again.|`|DVbQAbjsaa	wouldn't you rather someone who was into you? I mean what did you get out of the relationship? It sounds like she was not committed enough. I think you soon will feel a sense of relief that you don't have to force things. I mean if it was meant to be, it would be.     But yes I think you almost always feel like this when you get dumped and you start to become obsessed. I think there is a tendency to look at the relationship with rose tinted glasses on. Maybe when you feel ready you could write a list of all the things that wasn't perfect about her or the relationship...    but yeah you always do find someone much better afterwards and you can't imagine how you could have went out with that person. Just try to accept and move on. You can do it....good luck|`|Likst1Mxaa	Yup :)    My soulate dumped me about three years ago. We were friend for a little while but our connection was just too strong. I don't love him, but it's never been the same with anyone since|`|VWDYRlV0aa	maybe, maybe not. Dont give up hope just in case it is true

sr7jX2wYaa	I stuck it out  at first  for 9 years, thinking I was  doing my children a favor  by them having a mother & father in the home. but then it became physical, & that I could not allow my children to be  exposed to. So I ended  then. Yes I still Loved  him, but I did not like him at all, & 24 years later I still care about him, but could never  bring  myself to go through that again.<br>  After the  divorce I did not  feel sick , I felt a sense of  liberation, That I had not known I was missing. & did not  even  realize how  bad the  emotional abuse was until my children started treating people like their father treated me.. It was  at that point I realized the mistake I made  staying  thinking I was doing right  by my children , when All I did was cause them emotional abuse by keeping them in that environment. After  counseling  my 2  youngest , have for the most part stable  relationships, but my oldest, continually is emotionally abusive  to people. And as he is  an  adult now I can  no longer force him to go to counseling.<br>  I recommend  to anyone  being emotionally abused to get out as soon as you can , No good can come from staying *|`|iD4ejChZaa	God can change all things, all situations, people are only telling you what they want you to know, not the whole story, with Jesus there is hope and marriage is till death do you part.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	I'm sticking it out.

I realized that i no longer gave a rats behind about my ex one afternoon after a huge fight that he started for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  He was fixing to go overseas on a deployment and we had rented a nice hotel suite for the night. it was my first night away from our 10 month old son so i was excited and nervous. we had a great time, went to dinner, saw a show then had "fun" back at the hotel. he wanted me to stay up all night, but i ended up falling asleep around 3am from pure exhaustion. the next morning he woke up pissed (as was his usual M.O after sex) and began throwing things around in the shower. the more he did it be sicker my stomache got, i knew we were about to have a fight.<br>  <br>  he came out screaming at me, saying i was a sl ut, a who re, and bad mother, a piece of crap. he told me...well actually he said, "How would you like it if i took Brandon away from you and let some other woman raise him, cause i will!" he screamed that he wanted a divorce...etc. i was just bawling. i had put up w/this crap for the entire marriage and i was emotionally drained from it. i begged him to be nice to me, i begged him to forgive me for falling asleep (rolling eyes, of all things to get pissed over!). he refused to listen. <br>  <br>  then told me he was leaving me at the hotel to get our son and that he'd tell the base gate guard not to let me on base, (we lived in an Air Force base). i ran to the door and tried to follow him, he pushed me back then told me he wanted my wedding rings back. i said no, and he grabbed me twisted my arm behind my back and walked me to the hotel bed, pushed me face down on the matress and ripped them off my finger (i still have a scar).<br>  <br>  i followed him downstairs and he "behaved himself" while in public. i did manage to get into the car, i was NOT letting him get my son w/out me, but he drove to a resturant instead and then left me there and drove off. he eventually came back and then of course after he had his belly full wanted to apologize to me and gave me my rings back. <br>  <br>  i played along for the next couple days, but that was the END for me and i was just biding my time till the prick went overseas. he would call me from overseas 2000 miles away just to pick a fight w/me. he was nuts. i finally told him that when he came home i wanted a divorce and when he came home he tried to act all nice. <br>  <br>  the best day of that marriage was the day i loaded up the U-haul w/my things and left his sorry butt standing in the driveway watching me leave after his parting words to me were- "You'll never make it w/out ME!"<br>  <br>  ha! <br>  <br>  i did find happiness though, 2 yrs after my divorce i started dating my 2nd husband, he's my best friend we've been together for 10 yrs and married for 8 yrs now. it's amazing the strength you can find when you think you have none left!|`|7yrliotXaa	I ended it, took awhile to get out of it but don't regret it.<br>  My feelings for my ex is "HATE" and yes i am so done!!<br>  To ask for a divorce...didn't ask..I demanded because I <br>  had ENOUGH!!! I am a more stronger person and won't <br>  take sh!t from anyone now.<br>  <br>  Men and women mentally and emotionally abuse, it's not<br>  right!!!|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I ended it.

Also some tease because we just want a specific guys attention to focus on only us- other times it may just be insecurity that we are feeling about ourselves and we just want to know if we have the power of desire to attract- or we like being cruel individuals that have tasted the power of evilness and we want to revel in it while crushing all of men's testicles as we go by.|`|0XdkbEtFaa	im a guy and id say its more the other way round girls looking at me alot :D|`|KSUksBZkaa	becuz it's fun. haha, it SO is.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	coz of pricks like you|`|Q3hYBPJwaa	Her walking into the room isn't teasing. It just means every guy that gets all crazy is horny. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, girls tease guys for a number of reasons.<br>  Sometimes it's to get attention. They love attention, it makes them feel good. Sometimes, they tease a specific guy to get a reaction. They want to see how he reacts, and that will help them figure out if he's interested.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	It's animal instinct.....women have to sell themselves one way or another to get a man to take care of them...it's advertising, not teasing, the peacock in action....sooner or later you'll find your true peacock...you stud in the pasture...you....|`|LzJJn1m7aa	ITS NOT OUR FAULT WE ARE HOT.

If either actually showed the wedding may not take place though. lol jk|`|wOBZEFXFaa	That's a really neat idea! We had to order about 100 invites and we only used 75.

When I'm at work and I hear that kind of talk I get all hot and bothered! Then the clock stops ticking!|`|iD4ejChZaa	what comes out of her mouth is from her heart, she'll use that lustful attitude against you someday.|`|qZ0310yVaa	no not me us guys do|`|AA10457351	I'm a woman, but I'll tell you that the men I've been with prefer that their women do not talk dirty in public - however, they did appreciate a little something naughty whispered in their ear on occasion. :D <br>  <br>  Now, dirty talk in the bedroom that's a totally different story - most men consider it a huge turn-on. The ones that like this have told me that they like the fact that the lady they have been with all evening (or day) can be comfortable enough to behave a little sl*tty in the bedroom .... Dirty talking between partners on the phone usually happens when one person is out of town or unable to be with you in person can be another turn-on and makes for an interesting time the next time you get together with him.<br>  <br>  This is may or may not be the norm, but is based on my own personal experience over the years.|`|dd78df2787519f32b158b8d222e23f95aa	No, not at all.  I love it when a woman says, "I wasted ketchup all over the floor" and "Let's take the Jeep off-road."  I especially love when she tells me, "I haven't washed in a week" or "I don't believe in using a toothbrush."<br>  <br>  Now that's dirty!!!|`|rawz0RJuaa	guys i have dated in the past liked but my husband gets soo turned off. he says it seems slutty and he just does not like it. even stuff as simple as "i wanna suck your d*ck" he hates me saying that. he said he would prefer me to say "can i pleasure you orally" lol i think its kinda funny but he thinks the other is trashy and a turn off.<br>  i guess it just makes a difference when the guy really loves the girl and when it is just casual|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	no way, its real sexy, even more so when the guy returns the favor<br>  go on and talk all you want. cant get a STD over the phone, or knocked-up.  test me, via email. see what you got.  lol|`|dprURFLxaa	Talking dirty is what has always gotten my men totally turned on and freaky wild...I never knew this was something that might actually bother them...|`|mZXAZ12aaa	Well every man is different some men think its sexy and she up for it when she talks dirty but some men are like oh your embarising me dont talk dirty there gna think ur a slag and blah blah blah|`|5r2Csdzwaa	I only like it in the bed.

The best way to meet up with her is in a crowded public place or at a restaurant, that way you can meet up go on a date in a safe place.|`|naBSDtCyaa	of course its okay! lots of couples meet on the internet and get married.    the best thing to do is to meet her in public and go out a few times to decide if you're compatible. make sure you know her really well before taking it to the next level.|`|AA10682405	I, myself, am in a long distance relationship with somebody I met on the internet, and it's been going very well. (Almost 11 months).  The way I look at it, when you can't see somebody in person, but you talk to them all the time, you have the chance to get to know them without the physical aspects of a relationship getting in the way. The physical should only be there to compliment the emotional connection that two people already have. That's what it's meant to be, at least, even though sex has lost so much of its meaning.  It's for the same reason that I stated above that long distance relationships are more difficult to make work. Because you can't see each other, and the physical can't distract you. You need to deal with pure emotion, build your communication skills, and you both need to be trustworthy and able to trust.  But I believe that the best relationships can start long distance and online when you are willing to really work on these things, and when you are willing to be completely honest and to give up any sexual contact you could be having.    As for it being safe, talk to her through Skype or MSN voice chat, or any other program. They are the same as talking on the phone, and it's free. That way you get to hear her voice, and talk about your feelings and beliefs. And there's always webcam so you can see her.    I know a lot of people look down on online relationships, but those people are the same people who haven't done it, or weren't strong enough to deal with the emotion and making it work. If you really want something more with her, look at it as a test for your relationship with her. If you can get through an online and long distance relationship and build your communication skills, you will be a strong couple.  Ultimately, do what makes YOU happy, not what other people say is weird or not weird. The important thing is that it isn't weird TO YOU. Who cares what other people think? They aren't the ones living your life, you are. So whatever it takes to make you happy is what's important. What other people look down on or dont is not important.    Best of luck!

He is lucky he had a burnt supper, if it were me he would have had none.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	If this is a true story, he was being sarcastic and you know that. Did he think that she was worried about why he wasn't home when he said he would be in an hour? He could have been hurt and she didn't know. The bare minimum he could have done was give her a call to say he'd be back later than he thought. When you are married, you check in. It's considerate and shows respect. He can't win. He was wrong.|`|StoXNDBAaa	Wow...a rolling pin?!? I wonder when they are going to get people to have a permit to own those weapons.  Everybody knows no wife uses those to cook...they keep them around just in case they have to hurt their husbands.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	uh, im a married woman, and if my husband told me ill be back in an hour, didn't come home till midnight, and smelled like alcohol, he wouldn't have dinner. he would have the damn couch!!|`|FeRC5jkoaa	HAHA she was waiting at the door with a rolling pin, how cliche, i only saw that in cartoons.. ne ways... she was p issed, what do you expect?|`|AA11706291	I think she was expecting an apology and he's lucky she didn't lump him one with the rolling pin.|`|xwjoqf81aa	I think he is not a very good husband! She had a right to yell at him, cuz if it were her out all night he would be mad too.|`|AA10457351	Well, he did the smart thing by not starting anything with her when he got home; however, I would have been hopping mad, too, if my man left the house saying he would be back in an hour or so and then not show back up until midnight ... Personally, I think she was actually pretty nice to him @ least she saved his dinner. I would have tossed his dinner to the dogs and left him a note that he could "fend for himself," and to not even bother me. (Of course, it would be worded a lot differently and with a little stronger language to get my point across.) <br>  <br>  For him to get over his apparent lack of consideration for his wife, he is going to be "eating crow" for a very long time ... He better get used to it (lol) b/c she's going to make his life a living H3LL for a little while ... lmao ... <br>  <br>  So, in my opinion, he got exactly what he deserved out of everything ... Maybe he will think twice the next time leaves in the afternoon saying he will be back in an hour or two, then not show up until midnight ... He's got no sympathy from me ...|`|xIwPjhojaa	Charge Her with ABUCE! if you did that she would ???|`|2eoAqicdaa	Omg what a physco!<br>  Ive known someone that put her bf (now ex) dinner in his shoes cause he was an hour late from work! lol <br>  He needs to get a backbone and stick up for himself!<br>  <br>  Has anything else happened to him? sounds like she is emotionally abusing the guy! :@|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think he is lucky he is alive and well enough to have told you the story.
DzAFT8VDaa	I am going through the same thing. For me, I'm obsessing about the problems I see in our relationship and that makes me NOT want to have sex with my BF. This sounds like it might be your problem too. Men tend to separate more easily - emotion and sex. Most men can want and have sex when they are mad at you, but it's more difficult for us.<br>  <br>  Get to the bottom of your personal problem with him and try to reconnect. That is what I've been struggling with. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Because you live with him, you've become comfortable and he's always there. Sucks. <br>  <br>  It's what you call "honeymoon is over" if he looks at porn, maybe you should try. Some porn is gross but whatever gets you turned on,look for that kind. Then you'll be in the mood? :-/ <br>  <br>  Or try and think of all the sweet things he does for you and think about the things that used to get you hot in the beginning? touch yourself to it, then go out and get him. <br>  <br>  It's tough to get out of that.

2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Well we used to kind of do that. Both families are christians...we are atheists. My family doesn't drink so we'd always put away the alcohol and pretend we don't drink. My family is against being gay...My best  friend is gay.  Finally I decided that was just stupid...We're adults with kids of our own. I figured if our kids saw us hiding things from our parents then they would hide things from us. So we just stopped doing it. Our families don't like it but  oh well. My concern now is MY family (meaning my husband and kids) and it's not about making the rest of the family happy or about bending to their will. So stop pretending. That's just too stressful and you shouldn't have to do it.|`|44QPXU5eaa	I honestly do not see the big deal about religion and why people dedicate their own lives to something that is never proven as true and a book that is pretty much hear say. <br>  <br>  Thankfully I have a very understanding family and they accept my live and the way i live it because at the end of the day it is MY life. My partner on the other hand, his family does not accept him and me being together and has tried to blackmail, out him out of their will, just alot of horrible stuff becuase they do not approve of the way i was raised and my attitude to life.<br>  <br>  If they love you, they will get over it as you should be more important then "god." Remember you only have one chance at life and you shouldnt waste it on trying to make other people happy and pretending to be something that you are not. Be yourself and if they do not approve then that is their problem not yours.|`|AA10457351	Yes, and it can get tiring at times, too. I have tried being honest with my family in a previous relationship that they definitely did not approve of, but they were civil about everything. However, once I ended the relationship, my family told me their opinion of what they had felt all along. I'm now involved in the beginning stages of another relationship that is more along the lines of what they would approve of - on the surface; however, there are some dynamics to the relationship that are better off left unspoken to anyone in my family b/c they will never understand .... :D|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Nope. Everyone, including my family, can take me or leave me as I am. I could care less.|`|NGKwsawdaa	nope, what you see is what you get with us|`|PDAVQU3Caa	no , sorry|`|FATyhyZ2aa	At 1st I hid my changing views from my sibliblings. Then I just leaked out bits & pieces when topics were brought up.  My "Christianity" is different than my family's brand.  I keep Sabbath Friday eve to Saturday eve.  They choose Sunday.  I don't celebrate Christmas or Easter or Hanukkah. But I do keep But Passover & Sukkot.  I best explained it to them this way, I'm a predenominational Christian.  I observe the Holy days the Jesus did before all the other new ones where brought in.  They keep thinking I'm a converted Jew, Sabbatarian or 7th Day Adventist. Nope.  / It worked itself out because none of them even go to the church of their profession or even study up on their doctrine. So it was fine when I said, "Look, I observe those Feasts that YHWH God said, 'These are my feasts.'  He didn't say Isreal's feast, He said Mine.  So if I belong to Him, I feel led to keep His appointed times.  It's cool b/c we talk VERY openly.  We decided that for ourselves after being raised in a dysfunctional family.  Skirting & hiding truths lets harm breed.  So we've learned to accept each other w/ tolerance, b/c the love is so strong among us. / My son claims Atheism or something.  It doesn't make me love him any less.  I pray for his enlightenment.  We talk about our different opinions. / Your parents love you.  If it causes them some pain, just ask them to pray for you.  You don't beleive in prayer, but you give them a reminder of what their faith tells them to do to find their peace.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	No. My family and my husband and i have different beliefs. My family knows them and that's just tough shyt if they don't like it! I know where they stand, they know where i stand. if they have an issue, it's just that...theirs.<br>  <br>  My family loves me no matter what. sure some of my beliefs (or lack thereof in my case) do not dictate how my family sees me. i am who i am because of what i believe (or don't believe) and they realize this and are mature enough to leave it be. respect doesn't mean you have to agree all the time, you just have to understand that everyone is different and that's okay.<br>  <br>  I couldn't imagine not being able to share my true self w/my family!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  same here hon. I'm atheist and my hubs is agnostic. my family (minus my sister who is more agnostic pagan or wiccan), are devout Xians.|`|uecwFz0Daa	In terms of religion, my parents did this until their parents were dead. What a waste of time, energy and money.<br>  <br>  My husband's father and wife are conservative christians and frankly, are so vehemently hateful that my husband hasn't allowed his children to visit with them since before Katrina. They weren't invited to the wedding.   His mom and step-dad are just..normal and I can see already that we will have a great relationship.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	If you're putting on a front that is in total opposite of what you truly believe, you're not living in harmony with yourself, are you?<br>  <br>  Your family may be angry, hurt, displeased, disappointed, shocked, etc when they find out the truth, but I would think that all those feelings would be compounded the longer you wait to tell the truth. (I'm curious to know how this "lie" began.) I think you need to slowly begin inserting the truth into your life. Slowly begin showing how you really feel about things. Don't insult their ways, beliefs, traditions, faith, or spirituality, but slowly show that you have come to believe something different and that you still love them, but your truth is different from theirs. Avoid deep conversations about it, because that will only cause strife. But don't continue to live in blatant lies - if they think you're a Christian, if they think you live by the Bible and you believe that Jesus is Lord, when you actually think the Bible is a bunch of made up stories - then I would say that is a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge! living of a lie!<br>  <br>  I am a Christian and I would not expect any atheist to pretend to be a Christian. Christianity is something that a person should choose, they shouldn't pretend that it's who they are when they aren't. So I wish you well in showing your friends and family who you really are, and if they really love you, they will continue to love you when they see your real beliefs. Best wishes.|`|6kbgcOYAaa	If you aren't honest with them then they will never really know the real you. Haven't you ever heard the phrase I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I'm not?? That applies here. I'm not saying they won't be disappointed that you have different beliefs but I'm sure in time they will get over it.|`|NlxmeCWDaa	We won't!!! To thy own self be true.  Oh yeah- and be true to the world you will feel better about yourself once you take a stand.  Living a lie gives you stomach cancer.|`|dd78df2787519f32b158b8d222e23f95aa	I understand.  Sometimes you have to keep down confusion.  Why is making it known that you and your husband feel a certain way more important than maintaining a good relationship with your folks.  Then again, is how/what you believe that devastating?!?!?  Are they all racist and you two are the lone voices of reason?!?!?  I think you have to consider 2 things:  First, how important is it that they know... will it be worth it in the end to cause problems.  So you tell them how you feel, then what?  You live the rest of your lives miserable?  Second, who's right. Are they right or rather, which opinion or belief system is more widely accepted?  Will you not only be shunned by your folks but how does society as a whole view your belief system?  When all else fails and there's no one else to love you, you should always have your parents.  But what if you push them away, as well.<br>  <br>  Sorry, started answering before you posted add'l info.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I am not sure what you are alluding to, but I have never hide my life from my family.  I am sorry that you do.|`|dbQHlp85aa	I can definitely relate...<br>  <br>  Most of my family are republicans.. some hard core... some a little more moderate including my fiance and I. <br>  <br>  And almost all of my family are Christian. <br>  <br>  I have an uncle and aunt who are extremely liberal and apparently athiest as well. No matter what is said we will never see eye to eye on these topics. <br>  <br>  The politics thing... i can kind of see past even though he just doesn't make any sense to me so we just don't talk about it.. but being a christian, it hurts me to know that I'll never see him in the afterlife. I know the truth and I can't seem to let it go and as part of being a christian is to spread the truth.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean that i love him any less, but i do see him differently.. honestly i think he's a dope because everything that comes out of his mouth is completely ridiculous. <br>  <br>  But i mean, it really depends on what beliefs you're talking about. If it's a religious thing, then i can't really help there... <br>  <br>  but if you 2 believe that you should be swingers.... or you want believe that you should just go kill everyone  you hate or something extreme like that.. then maybe you need to re-evaluate your beliefs. <br>  <br>  You family will love you no matter what your deal is. But i think it just depends on what has to do with ya know. <br>  <br>  If its politics, then just don't talk politics.. but you shouldn't be afraid to be who you are.|`|MRDJu8v3aa	I am not an atheist but almost. I guess you could say that I am an agnostic-universalist-humanist… if that makes any sense to you. The rest of my family of origin is strongly fundamentalist Christian. <br>  <br>  I know how they would react if I told them. When I got my first divorce, they basically told me that I was going to hell. When I got married the second time, they disowned me and did not talk to me… other than on holidays… until after my second divorce. So, yeah, I know what it would be like. <br>  <br>  I am fortunate in a way; I do not live close to any of my family so it is not hard to stay hidden. I cannot imagine how difficult it would be to live near any of them. The only one who actually knows is my second ex-wife.|`|AA11969451	My family (fortunately) is very accepting of my religious and spiritual beliefs. Tolerance is key. We have a family of Catholics, Baptists, nondenominational Christians, Wiccans, Pagans, and Atheists.<br>  I live my life openly and out loud. As long as I am not treading on the rights of others all is well. <br>  <br>  It is difficult when one must pretend just to keep peace in a family. Make yourself happy and the rest will follow.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Nope. We are who we are. If people don't like it, that's not my problem...we don't judge and don't expect to be judged by others. <br>  <br>  We don't believe in organized religion. Most of our family members are fine with this, some have opinions. I've only had one other instance where we were judged on this (not a family member) and I feel like that person made a choice and missed out on being friends with a very interesting family. (She is a "go every time the doors are open" Christian and as soon as she found out, our sons play dates stopped. As it stands now, my son is a pretty normal kid and says her son doesn't have many friends at school. My son feels bad for the kid) <br>  <br>  People are people and it takes all kinds to make the world go round. just because we don't share the same beliefs, doesn't mean we can't enjoy each others company and actually learn from each other. <br>  <br>  I find it very interesting that the people who tend to judge most are involved in a religion that tells them "judge not"...lol....oh well.|`|iD4ejChZaa	do right regardless.
K2h6M1xqaa	If you don't straighten this out, you're going to be miserable in a relationship with him.    Perhaps that's why you're together; to teach and learn this lesson with each other.  --I know it is said, "People don't change" and that "You shouldn't try to fix someone." --But I don't think this is entirely true.    It's simply that it happens that people will want to change another in ways which suit their own needs, and not in an effort to help the other person become a better version of themselves.  That's where it becomes a negative thing; when it is done in a self-serving manner.    Relationships are these intense agreements to affect and be affected by one another.  --If he doesn't want to change, then to press the matter brings the question of free-will into the picture.  You can push like crazy for a change, and his choice will be to either stay and change or to leave.  Or if you don't want to put up with the work, then you can always leave yourself.  If you do nothing, then nothing will change.    Relationships are about one of two things, (sometimes mixed): To learn how to improve ourselves through conflict with each other, or to bond perfectly together and improve ourselves through conflict with the world as a team.  But whatever you do, you're here to learn.  Relationships are also about love, and that's what helps take the pressure off and make the journey a fun one.    If you are dealing with a person who does not have a properly working soul; (sociopaths do exist), then the lesson you'll be learning is one of abuse and survival.  The correct answer to which is this: "Get out fast!"    Good luck!|`|vh0yVJ7daa	He is an abusive little prick and has anger issues unfortunately I see girls like you with scumbags like him all the time,He just uses you for sex and something to tease and play around on to relieve his anger when you don't play his little games he gets rough and violent with you right?    Have you got a big brother older uncles or cousins?    Tell him if he threatens you or harms you in anyway he will have to answer to your big bro and other male relatives|`|77NzfiVkaa	He sounds abusive. There are many types of abuse, not just physical but with this guy's anger I have a feeling it could reach that point. I think you need to leave him. He is not good for you.|`|hoBREUGLaa	He has anger issues that he needs to work out on his own, but you can try to help him with that. Tell him that if he has a problema bout something he needs to be a grown man about it and stop running from his problems or putting them in the back of his head for the next time you argue. The whole sex thing is very immature though, which leaned me toward saying that he needs to take a break and get his head on straight. You shouldn't have to get forced to have sex, nor should he keep going after you ask him to stop.|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	he does seem to have temperament issues.  You might want to leave that guy. Doesnt seem like a winner to me.|`|RoEyFm5yaa	FIRSTLY,SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR AUNT.THAT CAN'T MAKE THINGS ANY EASIER FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT.I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT AN END TO THIS RELATIONSHIP BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND.HE IS CONTROLLING AND EITHER NEEDS TO WORK OUT THIS PROBLEM NOW OR FACE THE REALITY OF LOSING YOU.DON'T THINK THAT HIS BEHAVIOUR IS NORMAL AND THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT.TAKE A STAND BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE AND YOU'RE STUCK.BELIEVE ME,I KNOW.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	What he seems can be deceiving.    I think he has serious issues with anger management, and might be abusive.  Forcing the issue or getting angry when he wants sex, and you don`t - not good.  Driving without 'due care and attention' with a passenger - not good.    I would seriously reconsider your relationship.  If he gets angry just like that, he needs to go to therapy to learn to control it.   Ask him, once, if he would consider getting therapy for his anger issues. If he gets angry, or refuses, then stand your ground, and choose for yourself, and your safety, and tell him to leave you and not come back until he can show a certificate of succesfully having completed an anger management therapy course.
M1u6fdZCaa	I think some do.  But, it takes more than a ring to encourage abstinence.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Some do. Most, probably. But those people are going to stay true to their word and their commitment to not have sex with or without a ring. The presence of a piece of jewelry is not what keeps them from getting busy.<br>  <br>  And just to clarify, you are talking about Purity Rings. Promise rings are like junior engagement rings, part of a game played by dumb teenagers trying to be older than they are.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	When I was in high school.  That is a kid thing not an adult thing.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	They are just like wedding rings in the comparison to wether they mean anything or not.  The wedding ring only has the meaning that the wearer truly believes and promises.   Same with a promise ring...it means only what the wearer wants it to mean. If it is just a fad and they have one cause its what other people have it will have little or no meaning.  But if it helps remind the wearer of a higher promise then it has served its purpose jsut as anyother symbolic thing does.|`|WA8feS8taa	Maybe they did or maybe they didn't, we can't possibly know who waited and who didn't. I see no reason to believe that they didn't though.<br>  <br>  And to the person above me, it's not an advertisement, it's more something one does for themselves, to remind themselves of the promise they made. I believe in promise rings. It's on your finger because every time you look down at your finger you'll remember that you've promised yourself that you're saving yourself for your future husband.|`|Maepb9yraa	I was under the assumption that promise rings were saying that you were too young to get engaged, but that you knew you wanted to be together and that it had nothing to do with waiting to have sex. At least that is what I was brought up knowing. I never had much use for them, but they hold only the amount of power you put into them.|`|wjPcDlK7aa	Personally, I don't really believe in promise rings. If it's something they feel strongly about, then good on them. But they don't need to advertise their virginity with a ring.<br>  :)|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	that's what those rings are for?|`|MB4mePDEaa	no i don't believe.
uLtwGhTfaa	Hmmm, man Jill seems like a total *****. First of all I'm sorry but you can't do anything about it :/  & if I were Aly I'd tell my  mom about her and even tell my dad too. Maybe that would change Jill a little if Aly's actual parents talked to Jill about it. So the only thing I would do would be to tell Aly about talking to her dad or mom & so THEY can choose to allow you to see Aly not Jill. Because Jill has no right.<br>  <br>  - Well, Good Luck :]|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	Jill is alittle insecure and still trying to figure out her new roll.  You were wrong to ask about their religion and sex.  What happens between Joe and Jill is their business.  Just back off for a while. Aly hasn't forgotten you and when she needs you I hope you will be there for her.  Treat Jill as you do Aly's mom or any adult....with respect.|`|G5yQtHs9aa	One Word.<br>  Sabotage.|`|qc9iax2maa	You should go over there and show her dad the messages, because Jill has no right to interfere with you and Aly's conversations. If you have Aly's phone number, maybe you could call her up and tell her to tell her dad? But for starters, I would tell my parents this, first ;)<br>  Good luck!!|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Confusing Peace Dude|`|yoz5UbQkaa	tell aly's dad.
XPbwSSoaaa	she is really confused! you have to decide if u really want her coz u might get her and she will break your heart later down the road.  But for real she does love u big time only that she is not decided!   I would say ASK HER OUT! but do not be committed coz she might run away from u! The nickname and everything she is doing a clear signs she wants u!!!! so if u want her also then go for her !!  GOOD LUCK|`|XorzA99saa	I think that if she really likes you, she wouldn't have gone out with that other guy. Or maybe she is just shy not to ask you out and acts as if she wants to stay friends with you.|`|rIahFCCMaa	You gay boy  I think that She was a he  do you like to F*ck boys|`|v27YAcLLaa	yes she does like you...maybe she has more than one interest in her life...you are obviously up there in her favourites but she is probably unsure what to do about it! take it easy...she will come to you when she realises you are the one|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Someone who truly likes you; would not treat you like that. At 17 she sounds a bit immature (considering girls mature faster than boys). Move on and forget her. It may be painful for a while but not as painful as letting someone play games with you and constantly leaving you confused.|`|VWDYRlV0aa	shes a ho|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Of course not.
3240244337e315e4b6abfceee9445797aa	You will never let them go completely. If you really love someone, then that someone will always be on your mind. This is life and it's never easy. You just have to keep yourself preoccupied. Try to have as much fun as you can and just contact that someone once in awhile. Soon after you'll get used to it and then it won't hurt as much or the urge won't be as strong as before. It takes time though. It's a real pain but time is the only thing that can lessen your urge to call or text or just go after that person.|`|Mq27uY0Maa	its tough...... its not easy the more it hurts the more u were really in love with them...... delete their number from your fone keep a copy somewhere if u really want and try not to think about it but just remember .    this too will pass     there are plenty more fish in the sea|`|og3Tmn0saa	Are you the breaker or the breakee?  If you broke up with him, it's just going to hurt him more knowing you still care.  If he broke up with you, it's just going to make him annoyed by texting him.  Either way, less contact is better till people's wounds have time to heal. Then later you could maybe be friends.|`|i6tyscumaa	I've never been in love, not even puppy love haha, i'm still fifteen and i've only ever had like 2 boyfriends, who have both been idiots.    But anyway :)    I've always been the shoulder to cry on when my friends break up with their bfs, so i think im pretty experienced!    I'm probably going against what everyone else is saying, but don't try and force yourself to get over him straight away, watch a few romantic films, listen to break up songs, and cry cry cry! get it all out of your system.    Let this go on for about 2 weeks, have one final cry and then vow not to think about him anymore, all the things he bought you throw away, delete his number, burn his clothes, whatever, just completely erase him from your life :)    And then find someone better, because you will, i promise :)    I'm really sorry to hear what happened, and best of luck!!  xxxx|`|AA10900310	if you really love someone, why should you break up with him/her? if you break up, do it for good. Breaking up means, taking this person out of your life. The best thing is to leave him/her alone for a long while, and see how your feelings develop...
bmoCpcdraa	sure as long as i went with them, after all they are only friends, so, why not go with them? i didn't let any of my children date till they were 18, and they all grew up fine,so.who is to say yhat a 20 year old that you don't know is already at the 19 year olds home waiting for your daughter ? bad parenting results in teenage babies,so,then they drop out of school and get welfaire checks' hope i helped|`|FXCoGD44aa	I would. <br>  <br>  I believe that when you trust your kids they will do the right thing. My parents gave me a lot of freedom when I was a teenager, and as a result I felt no urge to rebel or do typical "bad" things that teens commonly do, even though I was in situations where I had plenty of opportunities to engage in such activities. I intend the raise my kids the way my parents raised me. If you raise good kids, with good morals and common sense, then odds are highly likely that they will choose friends with the same characteristics.<br>  <br>  But still, I would need to know where this guy lives, what time she plans to be home [[not the next morning though]]. I would also prefer to meet this young man also.<br>  <br>  Circumstance where I would NOT let her go:<br>  * If she was pulling bad grades and needed to focus on studying<br>  * If she was grounded<br>  * If I met this guy and he had TOTAL bad vibes and just had "loser" written all over him. My bad-person-radar is pretty accurate.|`|8WbfmK5daa	Depends. Do you trust her? Is she a sensible girl?<br>  <br>  Even if she is I would still be inclined to say no lol. They might say they are only friends but can you be sure? <br>  <br>  You could also meet her half way and say he can come round to yours to hang out. That way you know there is someone to keep an eye on them.|`|jcTnOE8uaa	Nope. <br>  No way in Hell.|`|MvisyrRVaa	Hell no I wouldnt!   "We are only friends mom!!"     *9 months lather...."Say hi to you grandkid mom"|`|pOsnTnimaa	no|`|ubbKS6BBaa	I'm 23 and single but I remember being 16. It could be either one. I really wouldn't worry about it though. She's 16 and that's a good age to date. Just read some of the crazy little 13-15 yo wanting or have had sex. <br>  <br>  If you're really concerned. Talk with her rationally. And tell her you won't be mad if she's dating this guy, just could you please meet him. And if she agrees to it, leave her alone. <br>  <br>  Just tell her if you are dating and if you're thinking about sex, tell her ot be safe and tell her horror stories. There's nothing you can do. It's better to know she's safe than not. Even if she's doing something you don't approve of.|`|IARYnu6zaa	If you trusted your daughter and the guy, and someone else is going to be in the house then I don't see a problem with it.<br>  But that much just be me as a teenagers myself.<br>  Could always just sneak out and not tell your 'rents.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	No, as a mom of three I would not. And my two oldest are boys and I would not like them hanging out with a 16 year old girl because of all the legal implications that would come from it should anything go wrong, however innocent.|`|4v6rG1MLaa	NO|`|fr57kcDOaa	She's 16 and they are friends so yes. I'd expect her back by 12am though.|`|AA11513689	Are you kidding me?<br>  NO|`|JUYjyP0xaa	only if i know the person|`|2nsNvIanaa	if u trust her. id say if u r goin 2 do something stupid get him 2 wear a franger (condom)|`|QOs9SCeOaa	I am sixteen and I think that if you drop her off and talk to his parents to make sure they will be supervised then it is not an unfair request for her to go to a friends to play video game and movies. If there is something else going on you being so against letting her choose for her own and being so strict it could make her more keen to the idea.|`|sr4BAblpaa	I would make sure you know the guy-and well.  If something WERE to happen, then you have to remember...16 year old = minor ... 19 year old = adult ... if they were to have sex or something (not saying that would happen seeing as I don't know the people), then it's technically called rape.  So just be careful with what you allow, that's all.|`|HbZPhi98aa	well im kind of a over protective father i would let her go but call like every 30 mins or like come over to ask for the keys and see what they are up too|`|AApetKofaa	sure as long there is adults in there if not then no
T4N6a7MQaa	Yes that is amusing. I do not however appreciate when someone asks a questions and then tells everyone how not to answer. My feeling is don't put it on here if you can't handle the answers. Within reason of course.|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	i dnt think so....|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Face it ...if you posting on an internet site to get advice ... that tells me your lacking a good source of advice in the real world ...  That makes here a last ditch effort ....    People will be people .... confusion & desperation know no social economic bounds.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Yep!|`|3gMytPXhaa	Let them satisfy like that.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	yep! world of love is upside down nowadays!|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	If you mean the stripper, her question was confusing - I think she was trying to say that she had given a false confession at her bf's insistence.  Her implication was that she actually had not cheated, but only told him that because he demanded it of her.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	yes i also think some of the questions are fake.|`|1sHBVWuKaa	yah them pussy *** ****** are gay|`|7uVjp0QKaa	Most of the people are confused at this stage.|`|szGNAjGcaa	lmaoo yeahh     don't post and i won't critasize|`|tzbYqdj6aa	not sure why anyone would post a question the qualify the answers accepted....kind of silly...mildred is my leader.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, in this type of case, if they're girls, I just try to get their number. :D            I'm JUST kidding!|`|8LzejXNiaa	yea|`|vyNlyfczaa	hell yea!!! I mean come on what you want me to tell you "you poor thing you cheated and that make you sad"  yea keep your legs together and be happy!!!  I think they just look for 'approval' that it's ok if they regret and they can move on....bully:D|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	I look at yahoo answers as a kind of "maury" or "Jerry Springer" online without the fighting! some folks ask some of the most stupid crap on here, when they should be asking friends and relatives for advice. yep,  I find it quite humorous...
EWLD4Quyaa	I personally feel women who wear the tops are responsible for who look. We all exaggerate and freak out when a curious guy looks but if we wear the tops, aren't we expecting the attention.? I don't mind because if I am the one wearing it, then look away.|`|968sJIY1aa	it depends who it is, if i fancy him then i'd be ok if he looked - thats what i'd want. not sure about a molester tho|`|8LzejXNiaa	if its a molestor no|`|BuTl5EyQaa	Don't like it unless its my partner|`|VVbZzAVLaa	none|`|59HXAtRHaa	Well im short and i don't know if theyre looking at ma boobs or me??    LMAO.. CONFUSED??  If they r looking at ma boobs good on em..  coz thats all they're gunna do..      YOU CAN LOOK BUT U CANT TOUCH!!!|`|jPKcb9w7aa	I mind.  If I wear low tops it's because I personally like the top and I don't wear it just to have some guy stare at my breasts.  I wear it for myself.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	is it normal, or abnormal to look? am sure they also do notmind looking at endowed guys as well as other women's breasts!|`|vh0yVJ7daa	I totally agree if you don't like us havin a glance or staring then why wear them sort of tops to begin with eh???????????
AA12349214	Wow are you heading for trouble on all fronts you egit.    Firstly the girl is after what she can get from you - so ask her to dress accordingly to suit the office not as if she is going to a club.  Secondly you cant give her the raise and not the other girl - the one you turned down is going to cry favouritism and you will find yourself in an industrial tribunal trying - and probably failing - to explain yourself.  Thirdly if the missus finds out that you are up for a bit of extra curricular with the secretary you will probably find yourself in a hostel or a shop doorway with a divorce petition tucked into your jacket pocket!    She isnt interested in YOU but what she can get out of YOU.  She also sounds like the type who would cry 'harrassment' if you touched her and get a very nice payout thank you very much.    Grow up.  If you cant sack her or move her to another department then start distancing yourself, insist on correct and suitable attire for work, and dont reply to this come on.  If you can move her then do so because believe me the short pleasure you will get from a dalliance is not going to be worth the hassle you get from elsewhere.    GROW UP!!|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You really need to hire someone else because you are living in a fantasy that is going to hurt alot of people, especially your wife. You do remember who she is. The one who has stood beside you all these years! You are confusing love with lust and this will not work. At 55 you should know this by now. Grow up!|`|htWw0OlCaa	She is getting you right where she wants you just to use you. Girls like that are out for one thing, and that's money..... She see's a lot of that in you and she is doing everything she can to make you want her. I know you maybe up for something extra, but you need to find it in a woman that isn't out just for money. She is a gold digger and if you give in to her, she will have you right where she wants you. And later on if you don't meet her needs, she will tell your wife. So, you gotta think about this. Think hard and I really hope you make the right decision. Best wishes|`|yGPRntXFaa	You know the answer, you just need another dude to tell you...    **** her if you can. After drinks in a social even like a party or meeting...but dont ask her out on a date.......................................  also be careful she may be setting you up for a future lawsuit or screw up your marriage........ now if you dont care about your marriage breaking and ending and you think the younger girl wants you then go for it........ on the other end... consider your wife and children etc...and a law suit from the hot secretary...  you could loose everything.......... now if she just wants to go up the corporate ladder and wants to give you some play... go for it.........................................  Can I get a check mailed... I wont put out.. lol Just keeping it real. I lost my job with the recession............  weight the worse case scenario, if you think you can manage...then go for it............ or the girl just is  a nympho and has many loans to pay... so help her out a bit........... in return you get the carnal lust burst of moments with her.......... enjoy it while you can my friend...but don't fall in love with her.. keep her as a sugar daddy and thats it............................    I need business advice... lets stay in touch. i need insight into a new business... what should I do... I am a hard working entrepreneur  ....  . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day...

The End....|`|0SQou2X9aa	my god! u sound like ur 15! all those years n a girl can confuse u like that?shame on u n ur married! what a waste of those precious years if ur stil askin stupid question like that.am 26 i should be asking u for advice,grandpa!|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Right, how big is your company? WIll staff start gossiping about your favouritism? You've got to be careful that this "busty blonde" isn't going to take you to court over sexual harassment case to be honest. I heard some girls are proffessional at it.    I am blonde, busty and I happen to be a company director at the age of 23. I would never give any of the people I employ a pay rise because I think they are cute. Hard work, loyalty and a good attitude are the things that are worth paying for.  Think how your wife would feel because of the shame that you went with someone so many years younger and gave away a slice of the profits?     You've got to put your business head back on.    You didn't get where you are by fluttering your eyelashes. I didn't get where I am by fluttering my eyelashes. I'm good at my job, got a degree and under no circumstances what so ever whould I ever sleep with a someone 22 years older than me for "love" or "lust". She wants career advancement and the only way she can do it is by spreading her legs - and if your stupid enough to give her that - more fool you.    Now you have to go back to the other girl and tell her she can have a pay rise too. Fair is fair. If she showed you a bit of cleavage and put on some make up for you would you have given her a pay rise?    Fair is fair.|`|mzadMLQgaa	firstly, your not in love with her. you just think shes hot. she could just b teasin ya FOR the pay rise.. think like this. girls are bitches. TRUST ME. im in high skool, i do the same to use stationary LOOOL flick my hair and stik my tunge out, then ''can i borrow that :)''  i know its not nice buh its true.. and your being unfair by not letting the ugly one have it aswell..  i bet the hot one wont EVER get into bed with you my son|`|cZNzMyVuaa	Why have you asked practically the same question twice, only this one has the extra embellishments of the pay rise and car?    **** off, troll. And if this is a legit question, it's too pathetic to be funny.|`|9jr5QaE5aa	u r my man dude just keep humping them coz it seems ur days r numbered    i just cant help u bt i like ur style    ur life is just funny|`|L7NT0yjYaa	Well what are you expecting us to answer !  First of all this girl is taking advantage of you ..  and it's pretty clear .. she is doing all that stuff we see in the movies to distract men .. and apparently its working on you !..  Man wake up you are 55 years old and not a stupid young man ..  she did all this to get benefits ..  my advice to you is to give the other one the same .. otherwise she will gossip about you everywhere risking to ruin your marriage ..  and please in the future don't give the attractive one any other bonus unless she deserves them ..  P.s if you really value your marriage you should ask her to wear more professional cloths ..     That's what i would do if i was a man lol ..|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	Well sounds like that girl knows how to play men the question is do you know how to play her.  I mean a lot of girls have a office fantasy maybe you need to make it come true.  UGH NO !!!!!!  Man you married maybe if you were single or divorcing but no pay respect to your wife and lust from a distance.  Maybe even use that busty new secretary as a new sex game called office romance starring your wife and you.  And that girl is trying to play you cause she knows she is beautiful hence all the tight clothes and touching.  She knows it pays to be fffucking with the boss.  So go back to the wife and give the ugly girl a pay raise man. Good Luck|`|trhMszD1aa	oh my god!!!! your a walking cliche!!!  you have just been played...have men seriously not caught on to this yet?????????    its your wife i feel sorry for!!! grow up and be a man!!!!!!!  stop being so bloody pathetic!!    she is no more interested in you than she is her own grandfather!!! if a hobo in the street said he had a million quid i bet she would let him have a feel!!!|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Let's face it dude, if you own a company, your not stupid, you know whats going on here. She is playing you like a fiddle and with more and more woman in the work force today, if all it take is a tight skirt ,high heals, big boobs and a tight skirt is all it takes to get into your wallet your company is in big big trouble. this woman has worked there for 6 months, and is fleecing you allow it. Not to mention the case the not so good looking woman is compiling for discriminating. Where is your brain? Let me ask you this do you think a touch on the leg is worth losing what you have worked all your life to build? Because if you act on this, and  tell this little flower that enough is enough, she will run to your wife in a heartbeat and spill the beans. Your wife or should i say ex-wife will own the company and when you wake up you'll be asking yourself what happened here? what did i do? how could i not have seen that coming? what was i thinking? and you  will not know what hit you because you may be open to a little extra curricular but if your wife isn't in agreement with it i can tell you what will happen and i have never even met your wife. I'm 51 and i would not even consider getting together with a woman young enough to be my daughter, but i guess if you don't start thinking with the big head again you will deserve all that you get. I can't even believe this is a dilemma for you. Let me give you some advice, fire this minx, hire another woman like your last secretary,(should be easy in this economy) and get back to business. If you don't want to do that, at least get this woman out of your office and into her own space so your perverted eyes aren't undressing her. One more thing, she is a secretary, what does she need a company car for? If she needs a ride to work get her a bus pass. Tell her you will be retracting her raise because company policy doesn't allow for a raise of more than 5% until employment exceeds 12 months and i bet she will show her true colors. You could also just fire her for creating turmoil in your company.|`|NQ1VG3TZaa	aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhaaahahahahahaa    i feel an emploment tribunal coming on|`|15MMsoVAaa	sounds like ur a dirty old pervert and being played out of your money because of it, u deserve to be aswell seeing as your married.|`|6rcgir2qaa	pretty safe to say... you're in the s*** now!  fair enough she's bloody good to look at, but if you are REALLY a company o wner ya should know about stuff like this.   She is interested in using you to get more money... and be certain of one thing - if you touch her she will sue the s*** out of your company for harassment and she will have a shed load of evidence. she could probably due right now actually and claim that you propositioned her for sex if you gave her a pay rise.  you need to transfer her to a place where her feminine wiles are useless.  (did ya actually get a pic? if so post it on ere, she maybe screwing you over but let us all have a gander  :)|`|6f762bbc5e3cc7770637e87b63c2b2f4aa	youre a mug shes using you ,you sad git
PZ52akGtaa	They would develop it because just like men, they have their own inner desires to see to. Just like men they want someone to love, and if you want to get real technical  because instinct compels them to do so out of millions of years of evolution. Does that at all make since?|`|7kga2aRBaa	umm they just do?  its like human nature, people fall in lovee
pIKPFpbiaa	Not sure...          If I really want to read all of that.|`|AA12212403	Be honest with her about your feelings.  Step up to the plate to support her and if she keeps the baby, support the child.  At least you sound like you are being responsible which is more than I can say for some.  I wish you the best.  A home pregnancy test is very accurate, she should be able to know one way or another vs. being worried and scared.  I hear you can check as early as one week nowadays, so get her to check so you can both make rational decisions.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Support her and dont even suggest to abort it or keep it or not... dont ever call the baby an IT...... make her feel special... treat her well and when that kid comes your world will be better.........................  she may gain weight, tell her how beautiful she is and do things for her.......
77NzfiVkaa	If she has a history of cheating on you then why are you with her? And yes I would believe it if she has done that stuff before.|`|N3U7xWAPaa	it will all depend on whos calling . cause she isnt that good . if people choice you to call cause there is tons of ppl who have Bfs and ppl are always cheating and do you know the ppl who were calling ? no soo its not a prank unless yur stalked by a random stranger . and if its not anyone you know then .how would they know you had a gf . and how would they get your number she is obv. trying to make you pissed .  and if you know shes already cheated . remember it does not pay to be drunk and horney she should still know its wrong .. let her know . how you feel about it .  but i think shes cheating on you     she aint a keeper .|`|hoBREUGLaa	I would take them as serious, and ask her as soon as I heard them say it. The only real way to get through a relationship is to ask question and to be able to trust your partner.|`|8LzejXNiaa	believe it|`|3694eca278728fd0a36c2ea7419c2fd1aa	I'd confront her first|`|I9LTTno2aa	Once a cheater always a cheater|`|gQtbwpyCaa	believe them if shes done it b4|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	i will frist confront my gf abt it....n wnt believe on tem until i see her doin so...|`|wE2etBzbaa	I wouldn't be with her anyway in the first place.     and if those called, I will tell them to enjoy the hoe because she got AIDS.   they will be frightened if true.  otherwise they will laugh, and you might know.|`|W3F7xeF5aa	i wouldnt be sure, id ask her for the truth, you can usually tell when someone's lieing but hopefully your girlfriend wouldn't lie. Just ask her... there should be some trust in a relationship. If it's true it's unfortunatly time to move on|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	id have to consider the information. Dude, a relationship is suppose to be fun and without worry. maybe this isnt the right relationship. DONT LET HER DRIVE YOU CRAZY! there are good relationships out there.... and lots of good people looking for one.|`|59HXAtRHaa	BELIEVE IT!!   Chuck her *** to the kurb coz it aint worth the heart ache!!    herd the saying!!    ONCE A PLAYA ALWAYS A PLAYA!!!    Theres no trusting her my friend!!|`|8rM5W0EBaa	i would she seems a bit doggy and i wouldnt get involved|`|6EztfzkEaa	Dude, it doesn't matter if they're pranks or not, you gotta put your foot down.  Handle your business with everyone involved.    First off, your girlfriend has a history of cheating on YOU while she's drunk?  I guess i have to applaud you for that one, because no girlfriend of mine would still be with me had she cheated when she was drunk.  That shows a total lack of self control, not to mention the trust thing is gone.  But yea, you need to strap your balls on right now and tell your girlfriend that you don't appreciate what these guys are saying, and that if she has any shred of integrity, she would be pissed too.  She should avoid these clowns at all cost (that is, if it is a joke).  If it's not a joke, then you need to lay the verbal 'smackdown' on somebody's candy @$$.    As for the dudes calling you, man you need to regulate A.S.A.P.  That kinda prank (again, if it is one) is completely disrespectful and rude.  You shouldn't even entertain that kinda stuff.  Plus, if they're telling you this on the phone, know that they are telling others too.  That's not cool.      Now, if they are doing the dirty, and calling you telling you that they've got your woman skewered at that moment, you need to take stock, bust some skulls, and leave that chick; she's got a problem (that easy, couple drinks and i'm forgetting i'm in a relationship problem), and you don't need that kinda drama.    I hate to sound like i'm getting on you, the victim, but you're allowing the stuff to happen.  You don't let dudes call you telling you their banging your girl, and your girl shouldn't put you in that kind of position.  Grow a spine, stand up, get off of Yahoo Answers, and handle your business.    Good LUck|`|GTT7qFeeaa	wtf, if a guy was fking ur gf, they wouldn't really tell u. i wouldn't tell anyone if i was doing it. cause u might become crazy, and get an axe to kill me. so better fking ur girl and not letting u know of course. they are only joking with ya.|`|6MHuI3NXaa	even though im a girl,  and a straight girl i would be so mad  if i were you.  it doesnt matter if shes drunk  the fact is that she lets other guys  so (whatever) to her when your not around  which is yes, considered cheating.|`|l3DlHJPkaa	No, it looks like they're pranks!!|`|d86b2f03db6baf10abae1a77da9c0cb8aa	I'd believe them.  What do they have to gain by telling you?  Find someone who doesn't drink and cheat.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	well, if she has done it before, then i would take it as serious as a heart-attack....and i would have left her a*s the first time she did it, to make sure it didn't happen again................"Guys always remember this one thing, YOU CAN'T TURN A WHORE, INTO A HOUSEWIFE"|`|ngoeL5Rpaa	Well darlin it all depends n how much u love her     If you really love her then you would belive that she isnt cheetin     But as im a girl i can tell you that the fone calls are probs true     coz 2 randomers just dont fone nd sayy they wer sleepin with your girl     Unless she wants rid ov u nd set it up herslef    speak 2 her about it and ask her to tell the truth  ( if she fidgets or stutters she is lying  or if she tries to change subject or her storty )|`|NFn7G28laa	If I were you I'd go on the Jeremy Kyle show. Lol :D|`|9jr5QaE5aa	believe them bt it doesnt neccessarily mean that she doesnt love u|`|0IpeXqK3aa	if when you met her you knew she was like that and you accepted her that way then you probably forgave her and moved on. now about those jerks calling you , forget about it, if everything is going well between you two then that's cool. there will always be haters and perhaps that's all it is . and if you go and pick a fight and start arguing then they're winning. don't lose your cool just have her reassure you by letting off the fuel ( alcohol ) either reducing it or dropping it completely. good luck|`|MEr99qKraa	the cheating wud've happened once and i wudda been outta there....what sort of loser wud put up with that behaviour from their g/f....|`|AA10746053	If she only does it when she is drunk...keep the "drinks" away from her and watch her all the time.     Listen, if she is going to "run-around" on you, there isn't a thing you can do. You either trust her or you don't. Appearently you don't because you are asking people who don't know you or her, for advice.    My advice: run, don't walk to the nearest exit and get outta that relationship. It will just drive you and her nuts.
cZNzMyVuaa	You may be sweet and classy but you're not very smart OR self-respecting if you are willing to consider trashing your personal morals to attract guys. OK, you're obviously very young, but that's all the more reason to be true to yourself - the guys worth dating will be the guys who appreciate the real you.    Forget this girl, and if your boy prefers her to you, forget him too - you should set your standards a little higher. Find somebody whose self-respect and classiness equals your own.|`|gwUMipsUaa	The fact that he'd rather have a slut over you says a lot about him as well.  He's a piece of crap and you can do better.  Maybe you need to start liking other types of guys.  Decent guys aren't wanting sluttiness.    Don't believe what he said about her cheating.  The fact that he went back to her says a lot.  I think he was looking for sympathy and hoping to get in your pants and do you, along with all the other gals he's doing.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're still a teenager, and teenage boys are not interested in love, they are interested in sex.     Do not ever compromise your own values just to be liked.     However, don't be smug either - just because that other girl made some mistakes, doesn't mean that you won't too.    Should you feel upset? What do you mean, 'should'? Admit it, you are upset that you've been thrown over for someone you feel is inferior to you.    But that's life, pet. Get over it and move on.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	The fact that she's already lost her virginity should tell you something. He's gone back to her because he's dipping in that pool.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	WHY are you comparing yourself to ANYONE!!!! If this is the kind of girl he is attracted too, then why would you even care???? it's not that shes better then you. It's that he is an idiot who choose the wrong girlfriend. Don't you think your better then his ex girlfriend????|`|t2R3mEMoaa	This is not a contest ya know so stop acting like it is one. This all sounds so immature so maybe it's time to mature a bit. Stop putting other people down and this includes yourself. There is lots of time to meet Mr.Right and until that happens do some things that will build your self-esteem and character. You will see later that you were the one who got lucky in all this. Wait for it!|`|XGvKoleaaa	This had nothing to do w/u he obviously still likes her & was on a rebound while feeling for you he's probably confused himself. Best is to let him be & date someone else who hasn't been dumped very resently.|`|OgHmNwV6aa	You chose the wrong guy; he sleeps with her not with you. That is why he chose her.    There are many fish in the sea.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	v-card. |`|xsvDrtrRaa	the guy is blind.. you know what if a guy is drunk and turned on his ex gf it does mean she still love her or his aftering something on the girl. you dont have to change yourself just to please someone you love or like..the guy you liked finally choose who he wanted to be with. Girl, respect is all we have girls i know there is someone more suitable and will show you how to be loved just be yourself, and aside from that being a ***** is not agood idea some boys attracted to them not because they love them its just because they want to **** them ok?|`|PyRxe9B2aa	You don't know how LUCKY you are. A drunk is not worth the time it takes. He has more history with her and he knows that  you are too good for him and it wouldn't last.  Why are you telling about her v card who and what she is is none of any ones business and you should not be putting others down to make you look good. If you respect yourself like you say, you should respect others too, She is not better than you. She is also not as lucky as you. PLEASE find  a guy who is your quality because this guy is not. Drinkers come to no good end. Find a class guy and you will be happier.  No ones looks tell you anything about them. Only personality matters. Find your match.|`|1uRUaSblaa	There are billions and zillions of people in the world.  There is surely someone meant for you.    This guy may be gone so that the best can come to you.  Don't give up on your virginity just to get more guys.  Many good guys go for girls who respect themselves and keep  themselves pure for marriage.Girls like that are rare these days.
Lx9bVRGyaa	Were you guys drinking?|`|19TSkwaKaa	try giving him a hj till its hard enough. Then have sex :)|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Find things he really enjoys to make him really horny, then he should be Hard, which should make things a little easier. Nerves could be alot aswell!|`|vaacRAi0aa	Happens all the time. Nervous more than likely. One of my ex's had it happen to him, and to my husband too the first time we did.|`|Wcib0PTYaa	Give the boy what he need if you want that !|`|IkWcwsj8aa	he's gay    u shuld dump him and date me instead|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Chuck Norris might know.|`|tCi6KKTtaa	Sometimes, to get it really hard you need to get him REALLY horny so instead of just a bj try something different like maybe put some lebian porn on, me an my friend had someone **** on webcam for us but he couldnt get it hard enought so we helped him an fingered each other, an showed him breasts an so on an it really worked (:     good luck x|`|SCg3kDz2aa	It is never the girl's fault. Usually it is not a fault. That is a dysfunction, and if happens frequently or it is a stable status then he has to see a doctor.|`|og3Tmn0saa	It's nerves. He likes you so much he's nervous. You should be honored :)|`|NQ1VG3TZaa	well it happens to all of us    if the guy really likes you that can actually contribute to it. it puts us under more pressure to do errr a good job. not like if its a just a girl who you dont see a future with when you can basically do/say what you want    just make sure that it happens naturally because the 1st time with a girl you like is ALWAYS akward    and i know its a total bloke thing to say, but if your still having trouble try givin him a lil head....
xpAk4yVqaa	No no no. Don't text again, wait for him to text you back.<br>  <br>  He could be doing something important, or a number of things.<br>  <br>  Best thing I suggest is you call him tomorrow and if he doesn't answer, don't leave a message and call it quits. Don't bother with him, he is playing hard to get.<br>  <br>  Oh and if he does text you back, make sure you text him back just as long as it took him to text you. Don't immediately call back so desperately.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Your being psycho he might have just missed the text, text him again.|`|xX7EnZsdaa	Yea your just paranoid just wait a bit text him again or call later.|`|B0y9aO1Laa	He probably didn't answer because he didn't want to seem desperate.  It sounds like he is into you but I think you should just wait until he calls you.  Do not call or text him because it will definitely make you look like a psycho.  <br>  <br>  If he doesnt contact you then maybe he's not that into you.
19TSkwaKaa	"Hey, remember me, i got your number so i thought i'd text you. You ok? wubu2? "  have a conversation!!!!!|`|JVPt99Hxaa	just call her n see where it goes frm there|`|77NzfiVkaa	Why would you assume she has a boyfriend just because she is beautiful? Call her!|`|yQdA5rHnaa	if she gave you her number that means you should call her.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	If she gave you her number, she probably doesn't have a boyfriend.     Someone once said to me they thought i had a boyfriend, and it pissed me off because why should they just assume that?    So just text her,  start off casual  and build it up from there|`|AQmcmW6paa	Call her anyways! I have guys call all the time and I still have a boyfriend. Give her a ring and talk to her, find out if she has a boyfriend. What could it hurt to ask? And if you can't, then tough luck, you've got no choice but to ask. But my guess is she probably gave you her number for a reason!|`|qLaw1VELaa	just grow a backbone and call her lol ask her if shes single haha|`|59HXAtRHaa	Call her..  Shes keen!!|`|Aqjvzjdlaa	Any girl who has a boyfriend and wants to respect that wouldn't give out her number. If she does, maybe she's looking for something better and you could be a candidate. If not, maybe she's just into you. Either way you got the number for a reason. USE IT! =) Good luck.|`|6NIhG0Y6aa	Assume she does not have a boyfriend. Why would she give you her number if she were not interested right? Play it cool at first. Call her or text her. Start off just talking generally, dont just come out with 'lets go out'. As the conversation is winding down say 'we should catch up'. If she says 'yup what did yoy have in mind'...say 'how about a coffee at x tomorrow. Good luck    ps there is no hurry. Just be friendly at first and keep an air of mystery about you. If she is interested she will make it happen|`|D02rAMWoaa	Two things:  1. Maybe she & he are not really serious, just casually dating.  2. Make sure she's not using you to make her guy jealous as  this will catch you right in the middle. Proceed with caution.|`|VjehSWF3aa	just call her CALL HER NOW u dont have to ask her out when u first talk to her just be like hi wat r u up to then after u talk for a while u shud go "oh n her i was wondering if u were single" if she says no dont make it a bummer n **** jst keep talkin all friendly like nuthin happened if she says yes then u shud go like "oh thats pretty awesome cuz i was thinkin maybe ud go out sumtime with me" ya know|`|RoEyFm5yaa	SHE OBVIOUSLY WANTS YOU TO CALL OR SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU THE NUMBER.IF SHE DOES HAVE A BOYFRIEND THEN SHE SHOULDN'T BE GIVING OUT HER NUMBER.IF SHE ISN'T SINGLE AND SHE'S GIVING OUT HER NUMBER DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED THAT WAY IF YOU BECOME HER BOYFRIEND.GOOD LUCK.
l7fyLFFtaa	I dated this girl, who I really liked, that was the same way as your boyfriend. I felt like I was doing all the talking. I felt like I was opening up to her but she wasn't sharing with me. Since she wouldn't tell me how she felt I would automatically assume that something was always wrong. I look back and realize that I was being insecure. I'm not saying you're insecure, that was just my situation. <br>  <br>  It's been 10 years and we are still friends. She is married now and she is the same way, keeps most of her thoughts to herself. It's just who she is. <br>  <br>  Being someone who likes to have conversations, not just talk, I came to understand that my ideal partner needed to be someone who likes to have conversations. We were together for over a year, but we weren't right for each other ultimately.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Hope my story helped.|`|kM77JKkBaa	The same thing happend to me wen i started going out with my bf. But as u get to know each other more, the more he'll open up. Dont get frustrated because its just his type, and as he opens up you'll have more meaningful conversations since guys like this put more thought into wat they say..|`|yARKV3PXaa	Take him out with your friends. Get him more comfortable around people, as long as hes with you he will be fine. And it will eventually click.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	take him somewhere he has to participate in like an improv theater|`|yFMy10CEaa	put your thumb up his butt|`|fRREBCxSaa	I would ask him alot of questions that would make him have to talk. Don't ask yes or no questions, something where he'd have to explain it. You could also play a game like 20 questions, that would make him talk a little and you'd get to know him better. Try doing things where you really get to know him, and once he feels more comfortable around you, the more he will talk and come out of his shell.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	I think you'll make him feel more uncomfortable by making him feel as tho something is "wrong" w/ him for not being so talkative.  It might take a long time, 6 mos, 1 year, for an introverted type of person to become more talkative.  Leave him alone, let him learn naturally on his own course, is my advice.  Just enjoy the times together.|`|9D0LG1HKaa	i would start off by making him comfortable around my best friend because if you introduce him to too many people at once he might get really nervous and uncomfortable. this might sound weird but tell him funny jokes or play 20 questions lol.|`|JnFd5vJBaa	take him somewhere he has a chance to go crazy like an improve theater. Or just somewhere. where he can have fun and go crazy...|`|RyptnMsuaa	ask stuff about him things that will get him talking more how his day going or something like that|`|XL1evQBRaa	I know exactly how you feel! i'm with a guy who WAS the same, but i managed to get him to open out more.<br>  <br>  I opted to look at the things he likes and to talk about that. They always have something to say about things they like, and when you really listen, and ask more questions it gives them more confidence in what they are saying to you.<br>  <br>  The guy i'm with is a real listener, and i can talk forever, and he likes listening and i'm used to it now. But i don't forget to include the things hes been up to, and what he likes into the conversation so he has some interaction in the conversation too :)<br>  <br>  Hope i've helped! xx
9d8u0rqOaa	Leave him alone. And if they break up then you can make the necessary moves. You never know how his gf is. Girls like that get really crazy if they find out their bf is cheating on them. For now, develop a friendly relationship. If he likes you then he'll dump his girl. Just teaching you how to play it safe.|`|yFMy10CEaa	Well i skate and so do all of my friends and the general trend in the girls we like are girls that are themselves. I dont really like girls that skate so dont worry about that. Just be yourself and see how that works. Oh, and make fun of kids that rollerblade, cuz thats super gay. As far as starting a conversation, maybe you should get his number and text him instead of sending an e-mail. Thats generally better for carrying a conversation. Good luck.|`|fnEv1p30aa	u dont like him<br>  i know in my heart u dont<br>  u laugh at his jokes<br>  call him hot<br>  think ur in love<br>  when ur not<br>  u wanna go out with him so u can brag to ur friends, or silently brag and look cool having a bad boy skater<br>  u want him as a trophy<br>  not because u actually like him<br>  think about it what if two people looked exactly the same and had the same social status<br>  but their personalitys were diff<br>  which one wuld u like more<br>  think about it like that|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	Wear cool design sweatshirts and hoodies lol.  That's what a lot of the skater girls do!  Nahhh, just be yourself.  Seems like he likes you already but dont push a relationship cause he's already in one!|`|q2POh1dEaa	Sounds like you guys are 12.  Anyone who dates people because their "cool' and popular are shallow.|`|BdALIympaa	clash of the egos.<br>  <br>  i find this ridiculous.<br>  if you think he already likes you, then why are you asking this?<br>  <br>  i you're trying to impress the kid, dont. he'll like you for who you are if he's even really worth it.<br>  skater kids are usually players..just saying ;D
AA11857809	I would probably just stand there and give him the opportunity to speak first and depending on what he said and how he said it...only then would I know how to react......after all, he is the one who first pursued... if he says nothing, I would go back to having a good time and ignore him.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	well you would be able to tell that he only wants sex otherwise he would have started talking to you|`|Dfppbeo8aa	admire his courage and find out what's up with that.|`|iU8pIf35aa	If he is as hot as Brad Pitt, I will admire his courage & give him a great kiss in return.|`|i1ldfvmEaa	I would be mad, if you kept talking to him the people around you would think you are easy and willing to let him take you home.. it would be very disrespectful|`|LCGJ2nC1aa	that would be a bold thing to do,,some people would think that was quite forward ,especially if they dont know them or nothing about them,, i think it would be okay if he was good looking and i had my eye on him earlier,,but not if it was some random guy who i didnt think was attravctive,,i would be like,,,,what the hell are you doing,,get off me,,hahah|`|AA12332411	that was really rude. would warn him am walk away from him|`|i6tyscumaa	yeah, i agree with one of the other girls, if you were noticing eachother across the bar or whatever and you were obviously interested in eachother, it would be quite romantic and bold.    However, if it was just a randomer, even an attractive one, it would really put me off them :/ and imagine how awkward it would be afterwords!    x|`|19TSkwaKaa	Well id admire his courage.  But i would also be quite shocked and probably push him away just as an automatic reflex lol    I think you should at least say hi or something first!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Well he wouldn't be using those lips again anytime soon. Because I would have punched him right in them!!!!!!   I would be very pissed if a guy did that to me. That is being WAY WAY too forward!!!!! I deserve more respect then that!!!!!!!!|`|gxlEqdclaa	No i wouldn't like that at all. If id have noticed him and we were trading smiles and flirting and he came up and did that then it would be different.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Um... I'd probably hit him automatically.  That's a bit creepy.  I mean, if we'd been giving each other looks or something and then he came over and kissed me, I might be a bit more responsive.  But that's... more of an attack.|`|cZNzMyVuaa	Depends on the kiss. Did it give you tingles, or make you want to slap him in the face?
HcAILcPdaa	I think you should talk to your friend who likes/liked your other friend. Ask her if it would bother her if you two went as just friends. If she says yes, then respect her feelings...there is always next year. If she says no, then thank her :) and go ahead and have fun!|`|J7k4xJtoaa	Talk to your friend, but assure her that it is platonic and that this way hes not with someone else?|`|wSKLLtryaa	ask your friend if its okay.|`|uF8RLL4laa	prom in february? isnt that like a summer thing?<br>  about ur decision: flip a coin!|`|9d8u0rqOaa	In a normal world, NO. You cannot go out with him. But if it's just a friendly date always ask your other friend if it's okay with her first. If not, and you don't go to the prom with him, then you're a true friend. <br>  <br>  This was kinda similar to my ex ex gf. We broke up, then she asked one of my best friends out and they went out which was a big no no in a man's world.|`|hl0iK2nsaa	Go for it.<br>  tell the one that got dumped that it's out of kindness.<br>  and that you don't like the guy as anything more.<br>  and that you're neutral.<br>  meaning don't pick a side of the fight.<br>  be friends with them both.|`|fBFNCS1Naa	Dont go.|`|9mcpblG4aa	ask ur frend how she would feel if u went but just as frends. its ur decision. good luck!|`|kgwnel4faa	talk to ur friend first|`|AA11285960	talk to your friend first and explain the situation.  if shes a good friend she'll understand.|`|suoY5vxbaa	Psh! Just go to the prom with him!
v0tIMAEnaa	why did u ask the same thing twice
P0Fjh59Eaa	Maybe it's TIME someone "stepped out" and told the authorities that he's married to two woman. sounds like he needs a swift kick in the @ss to get him to "care".<br>  <br>  sorry, if that's not what you wanted to hear but that's what i'd do.<br>  i don't have to worry about that crap, i know my hubs and his ex are divorced, i've seen the divorce papers but besides that his ex wife killed herself driving drunk one night back in 2002.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think you should leave him.  I don't think you are married, so you won't have to get a divorce.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Hire a lawyer to end things with her, this way he doesn't have to contact her.  It may not matter to him, but if you live in the USA and are not in a state that recognizes common law marriages, it will matter when it comes time for you to collect Social Security.  <br>  <br>  Actually this is so typical of men.  "Oh just lets all forget about this stuff, like it never happened".  Women are wired differently.

He NEEDS to fix this, because if he dies, the ex-wife gets everything and YOU GET NOTHING...|`|XWetnjgkaa	It sounds to me like he does love you, however he is a MAN and men are sometimes very stupid and the things that matter or are "big" to us women are miniscule or not important to them. He may have forgotten about the divorce with her and the longer he put it off the more he figured "what the hell, its been this long..." and so he never got it done. Tell him it hurts you when he says its not important to him. However if you think about it, thats how much SHE may not even mean to him. Get it? its like, he dont even care for her or whatever and so thats what i think he means when he says its "not important".... Cuz lets face it, we are just talking about what a piece of paper says right? In which case it really "isnt important"....BUT, what IS important is the fact that this hurts you and i think he should be more considerate of your feelings...

iblT1HJpaa	Looking back, this is the one person that was not supposed to do these things to you. If anyone else did them - you probably wouldn't care all that much. But, not from him!   He was supposed to be your knight in shining armor. At first, he was or you would not have stuck around. Typical of most people (men and women) after the mate is caught - what is there to fight for? The battle is won.   Wrong!  THe battle is just beginning and this is what causes so much animosity within marriage. Couples take each other so for granted and not cherish each other for the gift that has been given.   You have certain needs - he has certain needs and until you can come into discussion and lay those needs out on the table for resolution - you will fail all over again.   God has made you both "one-flesh" (Gen 2:24) and the meat is tearing. Wait. You haven't even gotten close to what is going to occur.|`|498JdszFaa	I think because you are so disappointed it all didn't work out. Also when you ignore someone you give the message: you are not important, you are worthless, dumb, etc. etc.     Of course it hurts. Allow it to come out, get into therapy if you think that will help you. You need to heal and rebuild your self confidence.|`|YVJw7vvHaa	Because you tried to overcome yourself , but you actually love the guy deep inside you ..|`|tg8Q25IHaa	Because whatever the problems in the marriage he's been your partner, the most important person and father of your kids. Letting go and making this part of your life end will probably hurt a lot. But if you are sure this is what you need, then take the pain and move on, better than going on witht a situation that has no future|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I know how you feel - I don't have kids but went through a similar marriage break down.  We'd been together 13 years.    You're grieving what you have lost - the hopes and dreams for the life that you wanted to have with this man,  You know the relationship is dead and has passed the point of no return, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.  You have lost you companion and the person that was meant to be your best friend.  The life you pictured when you got married will never happen now and it's natural to feel sad, angry and confused about this.  I'm willing to bet that right now you are feeling pretty lost, not knowing what is going to happen in your life now.  You had a plan and that didn't happen and now you have to find new direction.    If it helps at all, you're nearly through the worst of it.  As time goes on you'll become more sure of your decision to leave and seek the happiness you deserve.  The pain will lessen and life will be full of new possibilites.  But for now, allow yourself time to grieve - it is like death - the death of your relationship and the death of the future you thought you'd have.  Even though you know it's right doesn't make it easy.    I hope this helps a bit.  All the best for your new, exciting and happier future....|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Feelings, life changing decisions, ...... these will cause emotional stress.

Good luck.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	I think you have some thing more in your mind , which you have not stated. To me , it looks like , he is trying to change as per your requirements , but you think it is too late.|`|3gMytPXhaa	Because it is die -  worst.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Because you loved your husband at one time and you have children by him, and it hurts that it did not work out! you gave him plenty of chances, so now he want to do a little bit! You want a husband that should want you all the time, even when he just looks at you! and your children, even if it is going to the park with the family for ice cream, and the sex should come natural, not because you have to. and your children should know what love is in a family, So I wish you the best. because you deserve it! Good Luck|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I felt the same way after my divorce.  Over the years I've come to realize that I wasn't sad because my marriage dissolved, I was sad because I felt I had lost what I hoped my marriage could have been.  When I got married I had so many hopes and dreams for what it could have been and with the divorce, I had to finally admit to myself that all of that was lost!  I think that that hurt worse than anything.|`|ip7mlDmDaa	Hi,    I have been there too, divorce after 5 yrs of marriage and two kids too, mine also included physical, mental, verbal and financial abuse, I really want you to think about you dicision I dont think you want to let go yet, you know sometimes we let go of the very thing that we want and we are never happy in life, If you still love him dont do it, have you tried and look at yourself and what you have done to save your marriage, have you done some background chack on him and his culture to see what kind of a person he is maby in his culture he didnt niglet you he was just giving yu space for you and the kids, from what I sence is that he loves his children and he wants to try with you, I would say give him another chance and another until you can be convienced that there is nothing in this world that you didnt do to keep him thats if you love him, you know marrieges are not easy.    I am currently remarried and there are ather propblems, you know in our culture(Africa) we have an adejy that says every house roof has a leak so how you manage it is the difference you will make.  I really suggest that you try and give it another chance, make it work try counciling, prayer, make over, some time away from the kids, something it has to work, you know there is nothing like when you have divorced and you happen to meet each other, you wont wonder if you have taken a right discision and you know when there are kids involved you will always have contact.     yes I went through it but also I made sure that I wasnt haist with my disicion, If you need to chat pls feel free.    I hope for the best for you|`|mN9AUoDjaa	You're crying because you are grieiving the end of a relationship.  The end of any relationship is a sense of loss, and that takes time.  Theres no magic cure, you need to grieve the loss and then move on to better things.  Good luck.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	It's only natural to feel upset even though he is the cause of the failed marriage. You obviously love him and wanted it to work but he did not.    Yes, divorcing may be what you want but you will still grieve over the marriage because it didn't turn out the way you wanted or expected. And its difficult to handle the loss since you have such an attachment to him and the relationship (time invested, kids, etc.)|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Divorce, whether you are the instigator or otherwise, involves a grief process.  I have been divorced, and a couple of years after my divorce had to go to counselling and relieve my grief, mostly because I had loved my ex but could not live with his abusive behaviour. My counsellor explained to me I was going through the entire grief process, from shock, anger, grieving, youname it.  She helped me through that process until I was in acceptance.    Oh, by the way, we did have a child.  That makes it difficult, because you need to separate the man you were married to from the man who is the father of your children.    You have made a decision for your own reasons.  Maybe get a good counsellor to help you.  I do hear you and know how you feel. I struggled for quite a while.       I have now been married to the most wonderful man for 5 years - I was divorced 3 years before I met him.  It really does get better :)|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	maybe this isn't what u really wanted, and now that its really come down to divorce, u realize its over with.even when a relationship isn't perfect, and not all u dreamed of its hard when u know its final. what u really wanted was  for things to work, and they didn't. no one likes it when their marriage fails.and theres no guarantee that the future will change a thing.|`|AA11570236	It's because you don't have the marriage that you dreamed of.Not ever thing is perfect.If he wasn't helping out with the chores then he isn't  doing things to keep your household solid.
3Dhacs6caa	Aww dont worry, things will hopefully get better. tell her how u feel, if u want but if it doesnt work out then try meeting some new friends. there must be some other people to hang out with. hang out with people that u are happy with. start texting/calling new people and hang out with them. join a sport or after school activity and you'll meet even new friends. dont pay any attention to them, just like they do to u. if they keep on doing this then i wudnt consider them to be ur 'friends.'|`|ngLwXT23aa	hang out with other friends or make new ones.|`|wwBZh6lbaa	Maybe try to meet new people who will be more appreciative to have you around.

One other thing to consider. Are you ready to take care of a baby? Babies take a lot of time and if you or your husband think someone else will take care of your baby...you better wake up now.    PS - If you were not planning on haveing a baby, just having sex...guess again. Sex was designed by God to feel wonderful and it makes you want to do it all the time, so you will have babies.    That's why you should be married before having a sexual encounter. You know what they call people who have sex? Parents!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	The right age?

If you're not old enough,or prepared enough, to be able to raise a baby if that ever came down to it, then you shouldn't be doing it. You should be ready enough to take responsibilties for your actions. A lot of people are very careful ( condoms, birth control, timing of the month, etc) and still get pregnant.  Also, when its with someone you love (corny I know). But you don't want to remember your first time as with someone you met off the street yesterday...who could potentially have an STD. lol.  I'd also say after 18, when your hormones start slowing down, personally. Your head is more clear-lol|`|wE2etBzbaa	90 years old , I heard it is the best age for sex, as you will imagine it more than act on it|`|T4N6a7MQaa	At least 18.

iPNOVR6Gaa	Not all women fantasize about that, certainly, but it is very common.  Enjoy your imagination.

Whether many women want to admit it or not, most women wonder or even fantasize what it would be like to be with another women!  Don't worry about it, even maybe tell your hubby about it!  It might even open up some doors in the bedroom!!!|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	Yes it is completely normal.  Lots of women fantasize about being with other women.

kUE3Ddktaa	Cheating is often "emotional" - looking to fill an emotional need that your partner isn't filling. It doesn't have to be sexual.<br>  <br>  I think the best way to determine if something is cheating is to ask yourself, "Would I be okay if it were my partner doing this, and not me?"<br>  <br>  Maybe you're not cheating - maybe you're just having a friendly conversation with someone who shares your background. But if you're looking to this new guy to fill some kind of emotional need for you, instead of going to your partner, then there's something wrong with the picture. You would need to give serious thought to whether your serious relationship is really what you want, or if it needs some extra tender loving care to get back on the right track.|`|KWeU8LJtaa	Well..I don't think what you're doing (so far) can be considered cheating. However, if my fiance were doing something like that..I'd definitely be bothered by it.<br>  <br>  When you get to the point where you'd rather be with him than your significant other, and act on it (going out to dinner, to movies,etc)..I think that's where the line gets crossed. <br>  <br>  By that, I mean when you wish you could be with him as more than just a friend. There's nothing wrong with hanging out with other people, but that doesn't seem like the case here.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	No there can also just be an emotional element to cheating, it doesn't have to be sexual.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	you ARE cheating<br>  <br>  this is the slippery slope that is an emotional affair. get off it|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I don't understand your question at all. There is nothing wrong with having platonic friendships with people of the opposite gender. However this guy sounds like he is crossing the line. Unless a guy is interested in a sexual relationship, he isn't going to ask for your number upon meeting him. If you are in the least bit uncomfortable, you need to maintain your boundaries and set him straight. What strikes me as a red flag is you mentioning that you wish you were single so you could go out with him. That there is indication that you have intent to cheat on your partner which is not fair to him. You have to decide who you want to be with since you can't have both. It sounds like the new friendship with this guy is detrimental to your relationship with your partner since it is already making you have second thoughts.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	In a way emotional cheating is so much worse, because your building up a realtionship with someone else, and it's not just human sexual urges. You haven't done anything yet, so you have to make a decision either blank this man out of your life,or risk the chance of an affair, only you know what the right thing to do is? Are you really still in love with youre long term partner?|`|JAdNkzENaa	ive been in the same relationship for 3 years and if i did that - even though i know i didnt do anything sexual - i would feel soo guilty. <br>  <br>  i think the more important question is why did you do that and why have you continued to talk to this guy? are you bored in your own relationship? <br>  <br>  obviously its not cheating but it is being sneaky and completely unhealthy for your relationship.|`|WxbPOmrFaa	If you truly loved the person you are with for 5 years, you wouldnt be looking at other guys. that is unfair..and it shows how dishonest you are. think about when you marry..are you the kind of person that would notice and look at other men.. You have to be honest with the one you love.. and your love will grow stronger.|`|AA10532067	If you don't give your full attention to the one you are in love with, yes it is cheating. One women and one man equal unity together. Would you be upset if he was talking long hours to another lady friend?|`|73fuqfSyaa	I would think so..|`|29I8PWrxaa	When reading your question I interpreted it two different ways.  If you are asking if cheating can be motivated by only sex, then no I don't think so.  I think you could just be talking to him because you like the attention and are flattered by it - you may not just be after sex.  But if you are asking if it is still considered cheating if you don't have sex with him, then YES it would still be cheating.  Dr. Phil said on his show once that cheating "is anything that you do with another person that you wouldn't do in front of your spouse".  Would you talk to this man online if you knew your boyfriend was reading all your messages?  Would you feel it was inappropriate if you caught him talking to another woman online the same way?  I know it may seem innocent now, but I strongly recommend that you stop talking to this guy before it goes any further or before your boyfriend finds out and it ruins your relationship.  Furthermore, you should really put some thought into why you are interested in this guy this way ... are you happy in your current relationship?  Are there problems the two of you need to work on?  Or maybe it's just time to move on ....  But if that's the case and you are no longer interested in your partner, you really need to end this relationship before getting into another one.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	Yes any of it can be cheating whether its physical or not. If your mind is thinking about it then its cheating. I had an experience with this myself, im engaged to get married and my man was always so jealous, didnt want me talking to guys I didnt know, and I didnt because i love him, but then I found out he was doing it online with girls he didnt know. Its still cheating, if it would hurt the other person, then you know its wrong, and if its so innocent then tell your significant other and see how they react. More then likely you know its not right already. But if you feel you cant tell them then you already know the answer.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Imagine your boyfriend found you together.  Would you feel guilty?<br>  <br>  If youfound he had a female friend he hadn't mentioned, would he be cheating.<br>  <br>  But aside from that, if you can handle the stress: emotional bonding and physical touching are the line.  physical touching is the one he can complain about, but the emotional bonding is the really insidious one and we all know it.  You fancy this guy:  you want to date him.  Maybe it's time to move on from the last bloke? Youv'e been together 5 years and no wedding and no children?  Where are you two going with that?  What is a relationship, if not that?  Your boyfriend has his thumb up his xxxx and I suspect he's going to be overtaken.|`|4066RDqKaa	Not always sexual, but you could just have him as a friend.

XLXncQu9aa	Instead of listening, you can politely interrupt and talk about something else.  Just change the subject each time she brings it up.  You can be straight forward and just ask her not to talk about it around you but you can try the first method and see if that works.|`|BuTl5EyQaa	Tell her you would love to hear her out when you have a bit more time available but that you have an urgent appt right now to go too!|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Well, judging by your name, (brutally honest), I would just scream "SHUT UP!!"    Lol.|`|1148622cf8972dbc25aac49df8fd7415aa	This happens to people who are patient listener. Some people are very good in making others listen to them. And worst is when you are alone and that person opens up the trash to empty her own and fill yours.  Dont make yourself a dustbin where anyone thinks of dumping their trash gets successful.  Try this, dont be an ardent listener, whenever she picks up the topic, you start your own....dont let her continue for long time.....try to interrupt her as much as you can. When she will see that although you are listening, but still not very much eager then after few attempts, she herself will stop pouring her grief on you.
Fnsea1sMaa	Maybe it'll be a good thing if you see him the night before, becasue then you can ask if its still on for tomorrow.  Don't contact him anymore until you see him face to face and can ask him whats going on.  Maybe he's playing the "tream them mean to keep them keen" card.
pIKPFpbiaa	I wouldn't ask you either.|`|v27YAcLLaa	dump him....if he wanted you that badly he would has asked you within a month....|`|jNQbVDHSaa	give it time it might work out for the better.|`|NFycyvtPaa	LOL this exact saem thing happened to me. I was really cut but then i realised...    Reason is he's had his heart broken before and wants to take it slow.     I wouldn't take it to heart. And it gives you more time to get to know eachother while still giving eachother space.     Just wait it out.. if you really like eachother then it's worth it.|`|aY1OrXijaa	the same thing happened to me! but i was seeing a guy for about 4 months and didnt get asked out.    His obviously keeping his options open and doesnt want to commit to a relationship, he probably likes you and enjoys your company but if its not enought to ask you out then get rid of him before you get hurt.|`|AG3dYL84aa	Very normal for guys.  Being a boyfriend or girlfriend is just a name.  I think it's a good thing as long as he is exclusive to you and doesn't go out with any other girl ever -  as long as talks to you about it first (even a sports game with friends).   Tell him that you'll except it as long as he knows you won't accept him with any other girls.    Then one time in a month or so, casually mention that you're his girlfriend when you are introducing him to someone.  Then give him a night he'll never forget.  Tell him "see not so bad being my boyfriend".  In the morning he'll be introducing his roommate to you as his girlfriend.  Boys do very well with the reward system.  Good luck.|`|d8B2CWupaa	I would beware of this guy, I wouldn't do it myself but it sounds like he is keeping you as far away as possible,psychologically  but close enough physically so he can get his needs met, that is I am presuming you are physical.
LV9l8EFkaa	Because it would greater the chance of his actual girlfriend finding out, I'm sure ive told you this before|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Just be satisfied with what you have.  Many girls would die to be in your position.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	I'd wouldn't give him anything I had sexually until he committed and I knew it was serious. He sounds scared, but there are users out there, so keep your guard up.|`|KfptxDDtaa	Since youve been seeing each other for 2 months and just kissing id think he wants to be serious, maybe he really has been in a bad relationship.|`|eQENZXz1aa	hes trying get the milk for free|`|AA10682405	Exclusive but not official? Honestly, if this had to do with him being worried about what happened in his last relationship happening with you two, he needs to realize that giving yourselves the title of boyfriend/girlfriend, should not effect your relationship negatively. If you're already exclusive, having the title shouldn't make a difference. Unless he is afraid to commit to you officially.   I could see it being his fear of commitment, but at the same time I could see it being exactly what he says it is, but if its the latter, he needs a real wake up call.  My suggestion is just to stick it out for a little bit, don't do anything with him besides for what you've already done, because you don't want to find out that he's not committing to you because he wants to be able to drop you.  If you really want to find out what's going on in his mind, ask him. Communication is key in relationships, and if he honestly doesn't want to lose you, you should be able to reassure him enough that you aren't going to go downhill with just an added title. If he doesn't care enough to make it work, he obviously won't put the effort into it. So talk to him, and see how he responds. Don't put up with him beating around the bush about it, because you don't want to end up giving more to a relationship than what you're getting back.  I hope this helps.|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Kissing takes physical movement. Unless your a witch.|`|hUZIYYzCaa	In the words of Frank Barone, "Holy Crap".. its been 2 months.. give the guy some space.  and by space, I dont mean dont hang out.. just hang out with him and have fun.  As important as it is to him not to make things official, have you ever thought of why its so important to you that it is official?  I bet you havent.  Just go out and have fun..Thats what life is all about.|`|AA10900310	you must find your own value... if you want a serious relationship, then do talk to him about it, but state your position clearly... if he really loves you he will want to make you happy... if he doesn't, he will come up with strange excuses to avoid commitment.|`|o1KWtGzLaa	I think he might be scared an want to take it slow. He might have cared a lot for his last relationship but for all I know at the same time rushed it, so it ended badly for him. Now he's probably just paranoid he'll ruin this one by repeating the same actions. Maybe you should find a gentle but way to ask him about his.    Good luck, hope this gets resolved.|`|xCgGDcdIaa	he sounds like a jerk.|`|400778e7b89cc3d5f810e4265f6481faaa	i dont think he's serious about this relationship|`|oN92aOUraa	Dear Jessi   I am a guy and don't you find it a little weird that he told you that in the first place. What guy tells his now girlfriend that his last relationship failed after it was made official.  I don't think you understand what hes saying but basically he is saying he wants to go out but if another girl comes along that is better there is no loose. I think he's lying and just playing you but that is me because i am a guy.   Good Luck|`|M67qCjsJaa	he is a bad man why do you till him that you like him|`|AA10353907	Maybe the guys just needs time.

Yes, they are Independent Baptists. I am one as well, they watch tv but not a lot, and they do have a computer. I know this because they have said so themselves. I do not know for sure if they are Quiverfull, the reason, (according to them) that they want as many children as God allows is because they were using birth control in the beginning and miscarried their first child. <br>  <br>  (written by Karen Marie) The Duggars are Baptist but they also follow the teachings of Bill Gothard, which is where they get the beliefs of women wearing dresses and having long hair and no dancing. <br>  <br>  They are Baptist. See the web link below. It is an interview they did we they only had 13 children, back in 2001. <br>  <br>  (written by blossom) The Duggars belong to a Conservative Christian movement called Quiverfull. Quiverfull families try to have as many children as possible and do not use any birth control AT ALL. They just have as many children as "God intends them to have." You can read more about it on Wikipedia. <br>  and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I believe they are of the Mormon faith.  <br>  <br>  The devout Mormon followers consider modesty and purity to be one of the biggest values for a young lady to have...hence no make up and they stay covered up.|`|XsJHgrpwaa	I just wanted to clarify something that was said before about Mormons. It is true that Mormons to value the purity of women and men, but they do not teach that they can't wear make up or look really nice. Sadly this is an image that the world has given that faith. They believe in being chaste and pure, not ugly and frumpy. Many of the Mormon leaders have encouraged woman to try a to make themselves presentable because it is a reflection of how you feel about yourself.

If you send her a text and she doesn't respond, don't sweat it.  That's when you wait for her to text (or possibly call).  If you send her multiple texts with no response, you're going to lose her anyway, regardless of your thoughts on her thinking your interest is waning.<br>  <br>  I've been there.  You call or text, get no response, so you think that something must be wrong.  So you call or text again, and still get no response.  Now you're sure something is wrong, so you call or text while driving, uninvited, to her house.  This is surefire way to screw up a good thing.<br>  <br>  Whatever move you make, just make sure she makes one in response to yours before you proceed with your next move.|`|FXCoGD44aa	Stop, stop, stop. Why is it necessary for the two of you to be communicating about YOUR relationship with a 3rd party?<br>  <br>  If you want mature advice, here it is:<br>  <br>  Instead of texting, call your girlfriend up and be straight forward about the situation. Say, "Hi. So-and-so told me to give you more space and to not initiate text conversations with you. Are these your desires or not?" Finish the conversation by noting that if she wants or doesn't want something, that she should go ahead and just let you know directly and that you will do the same courtesy for her. A top key element in any relationship is effective communication with each other. Constantly going through her friend is not a good practice of this.<br>  <br>  If what you are doing is working, then why stop? Tons of people will give you relationship advice over your life time - some will be good, and lots will be bad. But usually anything that involves anything relative to game-playing in an established relationship is childish and, yes, bad advice. In the early dating stage while still pursuing each other, it does pique interest by being a little mysterious and unpredictable. But remember that there are no set-in-stone rules, steps, procedures, DO's and DO NOT's, etc... it's all dependent on your specific situation. If what you are doing is working, great. If not, change it. But certainly don't rely first hand on other peoples' "advice."

I couldn't do that. my mom kept telling me that someday all those mean things they say will come back on them.  sometimes i would pray that God would take my revenge and punish them for being so mean. You know what...years later some of those girls came back to me and apologized. they felt so bad for being mean. it really made me feel like God listened. My advice to you...understand that you are learning a lifelong lesson..empathy. you will understand hurting people more and help more people because of this (maybe even your own kids), 2) you are not alone. there are millions of people feeling your pain right now 3) you don't deserve it and when people are mean it is less about you then you think...they have major issues that they need to be mean. 4) focus on your good friends and try to find things you like about yourself ... it is hard because i know you are young...try going to church or reading the bible to find out the good things about you. You are wonderfully and beautifully made and there is no better person than God to tell you how special you are. Good luck.

She knows when a girl brings a guy over to meet the family, it's for approval.  What happens if you wind up pregnant?    Many abuse victims, the relationships start off by the guy seriously wooing the family and winning them over.  He'll brag about himself, etc etc etc.  He'll become best friends with the family.

Or maybe he feels that you still hate him for what he did and is not sure you'll be cool. Good Luck|`|Drj1VOpXaa	If you put yourself in his shoes, think about it.  He cheated on you because he found someone else.  He's over you, but you are not over him.  Obviously, he doesn't want to lead you on, and he wants to move on with his life.  Also, he might have a jealous girlfriend or wouldn't want her to think that he isn't over you yet.  If she sees or hears that he is talking with you or keeping in touch, then she might feel insecure with him and that will hurt their relationship.  He wants to keep his nose clean, so it's best that you just be civilized and say "hi" as you pass him, but let the friendship go.  I'm sure you have other friends that you can talk to.

jZPb9C0uaa	you know what i will tell u wat to do and wat a girl might like cus iam a girl<br>  a girl like a boy who is dressed good, who complements her like telling her you have nice eyes or something like that. a girl also like a boy who is really inocent not like being stupid or over acting just be urself thats wat a girl like  and a person who is intellegent<br>  a girl also fall in love with a guy talks really nice cus a girl fall in love through her ears and a boy fall in love through his eyes <br>  so just try to talk to her and be urself and i think u are a handsome boy! and u know she might like u too but she is waiting for u to say something to her!!<br>  take care and i hope it helped a bit a bit a bit!!|`|Gk1CO6IQaa	i agree with the first answer|`|wwBZh6lbaa	Don't worry about what she is thinking of you.

sEzrs3Uyaa	because friends act differently when they're with a boyfriend.  There is such a thing as seeing too much of each other.  If my friend was dating my brother  I would think she came over to spend time with me when really she's there to see him and I would feel like a fifth wheel.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	friends going with your brothers is a bit weird though don't you think? your brother could tell your friend personal things about you; and it would be like your friend is always round - not to see you though, but to see your brother. your being best friends could start to get a bit confusing and let's say there was an argument - you would totally be in the middle! what would you do really? family member or best friend? no-one likes being in that position :) it's just an awkward and difficult situation to be honest.|`|JnKD0NU8aa	I carnt say it about a friend, but i hated it when a guy i liked asked me to ask my sis out for him !!<br>  I was like shocked but i did it anyway and im glad i did because i made her happy :)|`|dtXzOGoKaa	because you can get caught in the middle when they have an argument or split up|`|7sG3Hi20aa	I can't understand anything about girls, especially why they need about 28 pairs of shoes when I've always managed with 4 pairs.

I am sure you dad can help you replaced them or you with your job,she is a very selfish person. she shouldn't treat you like if you were one of her possessions. I don't blame you for wanting to move with your dad.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	this definitely makes sense.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	maybe you use just *** and do that thing where you *** and get her out of ur life so the ***** !|`|8SKpsVG7aa	move in with you father and never speak to her again|`|5s3uFazlaa	When you tell her that you don't want to live with her and would rather live with your father, whom she divorced, she feels unloved.  Everyone, in her eyes, that she loved is moving away from her.  Since she is legally your guardian (depending your age), she has a right to not let you leave the house.  If you are allowed to see your father and she will not let you go, tell someone who will be able to help you, such as a social worker.|`|i3KOwxeyaa	wow, this is deep. Pray about the situation...we all have one set of parents and life is short. Let her cool off and talk to her about it again. She'll eventuyally get the point, even if a higher being has to show her. I would say its her pride more than anything or maybe she knows something you shouldn't know at this time.|`|pIc6TiYIaa	This is injust and blackmail, tell your mom if she doesnt talk to you about this and discuss it with you, you will contact child abuse control.

I went through the same thing with my parents. I wanted to move in with my dad also. And my mom was NOT happy at all and did everything she could to make me want to stay. What I ended up doing was writing her a letter (mainly because she wouldnt talk to me about it without getting into another argument) that way you can get everything out at once. Let her know you wont forget about her, you would just be happier living with your dad. It helped alot with my mom cuz it helped me tell her exactly how i felt without telling her...if that makes sense. But good luck and i hope everything works out for ya!!|`|tATsT9Byaa	Honey, she is heart-broken!  I'm sure her harshness is not intentional, she just got her feelings hurt knowing that her child wants to leave her.  I'm sure there are a lot of other things that factor in, obviously I don't know the situation between you and your parents, but I am sure the main reason of her harsh punishment is hurt feelings. Also, it depends on how you told her.  If it came up in an argument/fight....then yeah, her reaction is normal.  I would wait and let it sink in for her and try talking with her and explain your reasons....calmly.  Hope this helps...at least a little.|`|stHWFLCBaa	moms are wierd and wont admit there wrong or even just say a simple ill miss you PLEASE dont leave, they will rather do things and say thing that might not be true like the childsupport thing (saying thats her reason) maybe you should sit down with her NO SCREAMING OR JUDGING and asking her to tell you why she dosent want you to go and you should tell her why you want to go live with your dad, try not to say thing like im tired of living with you, it will only make things worst, insted trying meeting her in the middle|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Child support is not fare  whoever pays it, But the hi income earner will have to pay, and probably 10 times the amount that is actually needed to support you, and thats the law, it totally goes by income.|`|OUobBStYaa	i am so sorry talk to your mom about how that makes you feel and if she doesn't do anything try talking to your dad. <br>  I truly am sorry|`|ijLD9rZpaa	If she's abusing you, then call the cops. Call your dad and ask him to pick you up at night when your mom's sleeping.|`|iSBxZ3Zlaa	No matter what your mom still loves you. You need to go to her without anger and frustration and just work something out.|`|5MfbxKwBaa	call your dad and tell him to come pick you up when your mom is gone|`|xdq8i59Uaa	maybe she's only mad cuz..well..idk well i think ignore her for like a week or something ...ooo i got nothing|`|DCcumpkOaa	moms are made of pains in the ***|`|sr4BAblpaa	Honestly, I wouldn't even listen to the majority of the answers given to you...they won't help, trust me.  If I were you though, I would try to talk it out with your mom.  Try to avoid the whole running away ordeal...it will do no good.  You're Mother would probably just call the cops if you were to run away-so...bad idea.  Also, maybe your mother is feeling insecure with her job-like she might lose her job - such as many other Americans have in the last few months.  She could also be afraid of losing you-and uses the  "I'll take away everything of your's" excuse as a mild threat to keep you with her.  I don't believe she would do that-seeing as most parents know better than to do that-but seriously, just try to talk it out with her.  You both need to understand each other's views of the situation to get to the bottom of it; or else it will just be endless.  Tell her exactly why you want to stay with your father (with out being harsh and unjust-which seems tempting but it won't help in the long run).  Ask for freedom rights-if you are old enough to have a job and buy your own things-then I'm sure you're old enough to be mature about the situation and let your mother know that you can be responsible and handle the consequences.  But before you ask for anything-try to give your mother something back in return.  I'm not saying you should suck up to her like teacher's pet...and obviously you're not in the mood to even feel you should be nice to her, but at least TRY.  If all else fails, I think you might want to look into seeing someone about the situation to try to work things out.  Hope this helped (: Good luck
VaZGN8P9aa	I was actually recommeded to go get my dress from www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com because they had a good experience with them. I have contacted them before and they are very nice with their customer service. Apparently a website who makes their own dresses aren't supposed to post pictures of the dress directly from the manufacturer, and instead have to post their own picture of their dresses that they have made. That is one thing that this website does! =) I have actually been contemplating on purchasing a gown from them. I feel good about it!|`|TJKvoLeBaa	From working in a birdal shop I can tell you almost ALL of the dresses that have designer labels are made in China.  Maggie Sottero gowns are made in China and the Sottero labels are sewn in.  Yes, sometimes the designers will have the shops use better fabrics, but they are all made in China.  A lof of the difference in the good and bad knocks off is just in the cut of the gown.  <br>  There are some really really good places to buy knock off gowns...the only difference being the lable.  Just look for feedback about the company.  Good luck.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Miabella on here has and she recommends them all the time. We used lightinthebox.com for maids and flower girls and were pleased. What you may not know is most USA gowns are made in China and the designer labels sewn in here and the price inflated. Some will say not to expect"Heirloom Quality" but that isn't true. They are made the same as the higher priced gowns of the same fabric. You are getting the same dress as the designer ,just at the manufacturers price. Your price is what Davids or Angelo pay for the ones in the stores.

MWWUPWNiaa	Although it would be great to just cut to the chase and ask her out or to hang out don't. If a guy I hardly knew did that I be freaked out. You need to bring up hot topics. As stupid as it sounds I suggest googling it, "hot topics to talk to a girl about" there should be hundreds we aren't that complex =) But since your asking here this is what I suggest you do, after the hey and what nots ask her hows school going. You should be able to tell if the girl likes you by the detail she puts into her answers of questions she asks you. Try letting her I.M you for a change because who knows if she thinks of you the same way. After asking her about school simply ask her about her life. She will answer(if she likes you) what do you want to know and you are to answer by saying, anything, surprise me. You'll have the girls heart in no time. If you take it make sure you want it because many Ladies are high maintenance. Good luck and sorry for such a long answer =]|`|4lMM7UkFaa	say funny things,ask her whats she up to and ask her random things like:would you ever dress like a clown? make her laugh|`|OWCYE0ijaa	ask her how her day has been going and then just ask questions from time to time about her....like when is her birthday, whats her fav. color, girls like when guys know all about them.

GJoxxPBcaa	Okay, I have a few steps/suggestions.<br>  <br>  1. You'll have to talk to her about it. Say it in the right time. Obviously, when she's extremely mad, do it later. But don't do it in the most romantic time/place either. (Most guys make this mistake, because they think the girls will be too happy to be angry. No, that's not true! That will just bring us down even more.) Pick a time when you guys are talking, hanging out, having deep conversation. Then be nice about it, and JOKE about it. Let her know, but don't make her feel bad.<br>  <br>  2. After talking, you'll have to let her be herself.<br>  Plan some more time for her so she can go to spas, have relaxing time, you know. You don't have to hang with her all the time, even if she wants you to. Just make sure when you're not with her, she's still happy. For example, if you want to go to a bar, try to make it on the same day as one of her "Girl's Night Outs".<br>  <br>  3. If she's still being extremely moody, then just be sweet with her. It's hard for a girl to fight with a guy when he's complimenting her, and making her feel good. When she starts cussing you out, compliment her and start kissing her. It may sound weird, but if she really loves you, she'll give in. Trust me. =]<br>  <br>  Good luck with her!<br>  And don't forget to bring in the comedy. ;)|`|r6oaBPhiaa	like you said , she's bi-polar<br>  its obvious you are both in love<br>  but learn more about bi-polarity, i remember i read that it is exacerbated when the person is having some problem , dissappointment or insecurity in her life.<br>  talk to her about it, is she thinking you might be cheating on her something, or what is that is bothering her.<br>  <br>  talk to her and tell her you want her to feel better, and search about the bi-polarity thing|`|fnEv1p30aa	ask her<br>  1. why do u think i will cheat on you?<br>  2. why are u mean to me?|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	well i didnt read your entire post, but when shes in a good mood you should talk to her about getting on medication so that she will be stabalized. good luck|`|kM77JKkBaa	it sounds like she's insecure..|`|48f33a581499ea478ca95a87097d67c5aa	Only way I see how to put up with her is basically not to give a crap if she dumps you or not.  You fall head over heels with this girl, and you are bound to end up with a broken heart.|`|RezEkwMOaa	I know it can be hard to deal with that because you love her and care about her, but honestly, your going to have to think about yourself.

If not, it sounds like she should be. <br>  Bi polar disorder is a chemical imbalance in the brain. She really feels like she's two different people trapped in one. And it's probably very confusing and hard for her to deal with. Show her you love her, tell you that some of the things she does bother you. Don't hurt her. I doubt she'd hurt you, but she  might hurt herself. People with Bi Polar feel things deeper than the norm. Every thing that would hurt you, destroys her. Talk to her. Listen to her. Suggest medication. I can;t stress how important that is. With medication she'll hardly ever feel the swings.|`|NBEuxzDBaa	eat her pussy !!!!!!!!|`|05d6VYAtaa	-dump her<br>  -ask her what's going on and if you can help (best idea!)<br>  -deal with it<br>  -yell at her (not the best choice though)|`|yFjaNB3Jaa	if u really like her i would stay with her but if u dont like the way shes acting then u dump her|`|7f91ea2Eaa	Just dump her|`|lb8FBhWnaa	dump her.

That's for chicks. j/k.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, can you picture yourself being with her for the rest of your life? If not, then there's no point being with her because you're just in it for the short term. Let's face it, she's attractive and you don't want to lose that. On the other hand, once she gets over protective and manipulative, you get scared. Now, if you answered yes to my question, then you have to take her out and socialize more so that her behavior would change a lil bit. Of course, she can't give you a handy at a bar or a restaurant unless she pulls you into the restroom or something. If you answered no, then take it slow and keep yourself busy with other things, like school or work or any important projects. Cut the communication in half.. one step at a time. Once the communication is gone, then you can leave her. If you leave her right away she might just kill you so be careful and follow the steps that I told you.<br>  <br>  If it gets really dangerous, save all the messages she sends you about threatening you and all. You can use this in court if you need to get a restraining order.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be safe.|`|DNDZ0bxiaa	well considering your wanting to fix this and not just dump her means alot and shows your really care for her. i know i can be pretty bipolar with my borfriend aswell, i'll do the whole "where are you, who are you with, and what are you doing" thing cause i can get pretty paranoid. but deep down i trust him. we've been together for over a year now and both know we would never cheat on the other. but does is actually like cause a fight? cause it sounds like she'll just be moody and it kinda irritates you, but i might be understanding it wrong. but just try to be as patient as you can with her. and possibly bring it up to her attention that she is the only girl for you. if it doesnt help theres robably not much you can do. because girls are girls and we will always have are really fun moments and then our b****y moments|`|RiQA4Epraa	IMO<br>  sounds like you like/love her cause shes sexual and hot?<br>  <br>  doesnt seem like a good enough reason to like somebody<br>  <br>  and i dont think shes bi-polar<br>  shes just a really jealous person<br>  that cant control herself|`|ZoeS825Kaa	Training, training, training, training.  You must bark back and scare the piss out of her.  You are too long into it to train her softly.  Man up when she is being a ****, tell her to cut the **** or you'll leave.  Also....pawn her off on her friends, this will take some of the obsession away. MAN UP!|`|cuqP79Foaa	i think she likes you a lot and that's her way of expressing it, try and deal! but, let her go (casually) and hope everything will be okay.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	In the beginning it almost sounded like you have a Gemini on your hands. LOL. I say that because Geminis are very sexual. They will let you know when they are not happy. When they are happy and turned on watch out!! It's an olympic event.<br>  Anyway when I got more in depth, she sounds like she has trust issues. Wouldn't say she is bi-polar. It is possible that she could have been hurt in the past by someone she really liked. Staying on her good side may be out of your hands. People who have trust issues just act this way. No matter what you do she's going to probably act this way anyway|`|szLSTtuwaa	I think im your gf!!!! <br>  <br>  Im exactly the same... I think its more of .....

I had a bf that is bipolar too. He wasn't that protective over me but his moods would change really easily. what you can do is just try talking to her about it and tell her how she can get at times.. or maybe tell her parents so they can take her to the doctors and give her some medicine to calm down or something.? <br>  <br>  She probably just really likes you and is just worried that your gonna cheat on her.. If she keeps mentioning it then just let her know how much you love her and that she is the perfect girl for you and that there is no way you would cheat on her.. Just so she knows. <br>  <br>  But if your really scared then the only thing you can do is just break up with her.. because if you dont try talking to her or get her some help then its just gonna go to the point where your not gonna be able to take it anymore.|`|IXIjOoneaa	is she on any medication? bi polar can be "controlled" by certain medications.....  i don't think there's much you can do about things honestly... this just sounds like the way she is..|`|SyAIl2btaa	You should deff talking to her when shes in a good mood about this. If she doesnt listen to your opinions then you should think if this is really worth all of this. Granted, you love her and she loves you. When she gets really scary you should tell her how you feel and then again see her reaction. This might be to much for you to handle but it is also unconditional love.<br>  <br>  This girl may be a lot ti handle but she has ur heart so talk to her and if you can talk things out or something doesnt go well there is medication. <br>  <br>  Maybe even a counseler. But the first step is talking tihs through to see if she understands you.|`|muk4bPPhaa	It can be really hard to deal with a bi-polar person.  I've had to my whole life.  Properly medicated she's a lot better, so get her to a doctor.  When she goes odd, talk to her firmly and sometimes repetitively, to make her see she's being ridiculous.  Don't dump her for it.  Personally, I think doing what you're doing out of wedlock is wrong (opinion).  Get her medical attention though, it'll help you both.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	you obviously know the different sides of her, you just need to work on going with her mood swings, because there are going to be times when you know what you should and shouldn't say to her, so just try your best.|`|q2POh1dEaa	Sounds like the average girl to me<br>  <br>  :P|`|suoY5vxbaa	I would break up with her. If she is going back and forth, it's gonna get to hard for you to handle and you will break up with her sooner or later.. okay.. well to help you: respond to her texts faster, say ily (i love you) more annndd keep your pants on!! ;) haha|`|XL1evQBRaa	Putting myself in her situation, whatever you do now watch what you say, or do. You don't want to put the wrong thing across at a bad time.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't want to leave you that much, you shouldn't be too hasty if you say anything about this situation.<br>  <br>  I think, you should nicely and calming explain that she shouldn't get so paranoid. That you really like her, and she drives you crazy in a good way, but you don't want to **** it all up, by a silly little argument about where you are or what you are doing. <br>  <br>  Put it out to her that trust is important - that you need it, and that you trust her.<br>  <br>  Good luck :o)|`|gYuJUyvvaa	She sounds like she may have a mental illness, sorry.|`|iNzRRI70aa	well she is diffo bi-polar like i dont even get that she is cute and then mean they cute and then sexy then mean so i dont even know what to tell you. i dont think there is really anything that you can do but stay with her and deal with it or just flat out dump her. so i really dont no.<br>  <3much love<br>  LuCkY
AA10065812	After 20 years of dealing with divorced and single fathers, as well as seeing the kind of things unscrupulous men can pull, I firmly believe there should not only be prenuptial agreements, but also sexual contracts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sex-contract.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sex-contract.com/</a>|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I think a lot of people get offended because its like saying you dont trust the person and you expect the marriage to fail before it even begins.|`|hs793CCxaa	I just couldn't be bothered reading all this but will answer the first part of your Question.<br>  <br>  Marriage is all about trust. <br>  <br>  Pre Nups are all about the end of the marriage and lack of trust before the marriage has even started. End of story.|`|0AShsMsoaa	this question steams me, because if two people work together to create a home and family, they should both equally share the rewards if they separate. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER,   if a person  comes into a marriage with money and property, i firmly, urgently believe it is prudent to enter into a prenup.  for many good reasons doing with family, children, and other issues.  <br>  <br>  i am all for prenups.  if two people cant be upfront and logical about their assets, then, they arent a good marriage bet.  it  would seem to me that if one person is fighting the prenup, they may have an unsavory ulterior motive for not wanting it.<br>  <br>  and, by the same token, if one person is pushing for a prenup to victimize and take advantage of the other,  with the intent of using them and then discarding them with no penalty to them,   that is not good either.   that is why lawyers must look at a prenup.|`|AA10197672	I dont think its a bad idea. I would not care if my BF asked me to do that - I love him a lot and all I want is to be marrieed to HIM and not to gain his money or stuff. I am an indeoendent woman, I work hard to get what I want. All I'd want from this life would be him. I'd understand where is coming from if he asks such a thing. I wont lie, it will  hurt a bit, but i will understand. I know that he wont ask me that because we trust eachother a lot and when we say I DO we are saying it to stay together forever and not thinking about getting a divorce. Now its a different story if you marry someone thats been divorce and lost everything - then you'd have to understand they are simply scared to go through it again! or if their mom/dad got divorced. Remember when ppl are hurt they do hurtful things and dont think taking half of what the other person does is hurtful-they think itst their right , there is a lot involved into why one might ask their partner to sign....|`|AA10408380	I wouldn't mind signing a prenup at all. Because it's better to sign a prenup rather than go to court where the objective is to make ur partner bleed. U are marrying for money, but not  solely. It's just a perk, and when u decide u've had enough, u loose the perk. But many hate the idea of a prenup because they don't want to think about divorce. They don't want to entertain the notion that most ppl marry their partners out of all other reasons than love, initially. This is because love takes time. Sure, u say u love, and u do, but the LOVE most speak of, only develops through time. That's the kind of love that u don't have to express always, but u know u need each other,and its not due to kids or marital assets.<br>  <br>  Prenups would make marriages a whole lot easier for sure.|`|dbQHlp85aa	asking someone to get a prenup is pretty much saying, "i don't think it's going to work, but we'll give it a shot"... <br>  <br>  when i was younger I understood your point... especially since divorce is so common today. <br>  <br>  But now that I'm getting married.. i have no intentions of it ending in a divorce so why even get one. Marriage is a lot of work... while you're right.. it's not some fantasy fairytale, that doesn't mean that once things get a little hairy you should run right out and get an attorney. <br>  <br>  Marriage is not something to be taken so lightly as it is taken today but that's what today's generation is all about.. "i want it, i want it now, and I don't want to work for it... and when things get too hard.. i'll just quit and find something else." <br>  <br>  But marriage isn't supposed to be about that. If  you have a preconceived notion that divorce is possible.. you shouldn't get married.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Prenup means preparing for the possibility of divorce. It is all about your frame of mind...expect the worst, prepare for the worst (in the situation of marriage) and you will get the worst. To each their own, but if you don't trust someone to the point of getting a prenup then why are you marrying the person?|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I can see both sides of this. I have a couple that I'm friends with that had marriages end and they got taken for alot of money (that happened with both the man and the woman) They decided to have a prenup done b/c of that. Totally understandable. But at the same time I would be really offended if asked to sign a prenup b/c it shows a lack of trust. (With my friends they both have SERIOUS trust issues when it comes to the money) If people want to do that then that's up to them...but I wouldn't have married someone who asked me to do that.|`|AA10240683	It is a "trust" issue. When you get married, it is supposed to be for life, therefore, there should be no question about financial and all that good stuff. I am being real here. There are gold diggers out there who say they love you and play you until divorce time and then want half of what you got. The situation should not be "If you love me you won't make me sign a pre-nup". Instead it should be " If you do love you will sign a pre-nup for my peace of mind".|`|AA11788494	I asked my husband for a prenup.  He did it.  He didn't like it but he did it.  I don't care.  I would never marry again without one.  Don't let some little prissy thing come along and fool you into not getting one.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You make a good case for the pre-nup, but some people think that a pre-nup is sort of a self-fulfilling proficy. While you feel strong about your views, the woman you want to marry may feel strong about her views. It has nothing to do with you calling someone's bluff. That is only if your looking at it YOUR way. Some people simply don't want to put anything out there that goes in a negative direction, and basically a pre-nup is a preparation for divorce. I don't believe in them. If someone does, they don't truly believe in marriage as in better or for worse till death do us part. If you felt that way, you wouldn't need a pre-nup. You have to be willing to roll with it, while your spouse changes. Both of you will change in life, but a marraige is a forever promise. It's not like, if you change in a couple years and I don't like you I will divorce you...that's not what it's about|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I wouldn't have any problem signing a prenup agreement.  I think that the people that are offended by them are the ones that want to be with someone because they have money and they have ill intentions to start with.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Bc they haven't been thru a nasty divorce.<br>  <br>  Edit: I repeat my previous statement and add that while I love my bf very much, I've been through a very nasty (and very unexpected) divorce. It's reality. It happens. So as confident as I am in my new relationship, I will take measures to make sure I don't have to go through any of that again.|`|SIK58haraa	I would sign a prenup but I would be offended that the man I love thinks I would leave him and take all his money..When you get married you get married to be together forever. Even thinking of the option of getting divorced is hurt full.|`|WA8feS8taa	If my fiance asked for a prenup I would be very offended because think about it. The person asking is basically saying that they may not be together forever. And if we won't be together forever then why the hell are we getting married?|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	"WHY DO SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BEING SUPPORTED FOR LIFE by an ex?"<br>  <br>  Because MOST of the time it's stay at home moms who GAVE UP THEIR CAREERS to support their husband's dreams and to have their children. Women and men, don't get paid for the YEARS of labor they endured and no longer have a career to speak of... so they have NOTHING to fall back on.<br>  <br>  That is why an ex should support you... because in turn YOU SUPPORTED THEM FIRST and gave up your career to be WITH THEM!
AA10904025	I hate to tell you this, interested on not he'd be at the top of my list. You know that list where I mess up his car, his credit, his face and anything else of his I can get my hands on? But I have a temper, so maybe you'll fair better with her.|`|X40Ww89qaa	ask him what philander means|`|KUXjoCiAaa	AFTER KNOWING HIM I 'II HATE HIM & NEVER TRUST HIM.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	kick his ***|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	I had a very similar experience to that. I scorned him and ridiculed him by accident lol. I said something conffidentially that someone over heard and because no one liked him for being the way he was he is still ridiculed to this day. I'm just happy he didn't take my virginity and that he introduced me to my now fiance.   But the average girl will spread rumors (true and false) probably knee you in the balls, and do a lot of things to hurt you and warn other girls about you.  And most girls would either feel good about themselves, or they would find it funny and laugh, but probably not to your face.

Sometimes, people don't really want to be what they are. Why he behaves like that. And maybe just be a friend to understand him better. If I am not interested, well, just forget about him. Why bother?|`|RY2VFtw0aa	I would just try to change him since i would like him and if it does not work changing myself is better and throw him out of my way and take it has a experience so further i wont be fooled by any one|`|FPGqq2Tcaa	i wud fight with girl power!!    :P|`|mo5N8tPtaa	if i love him and i discover this i would go mad...really i can live with so much pain but if i don't love him then i will maje his life a hell and take revenge

In a few years time you might just bump into prince charming, mr right, or whoever you have your sights set on, and you'll be able to say with pride that you didn't waste your time and emotion with this jerk. any guy who calls a girl frigid just because she respects herself enough to say no should not be allowed to have a girlfriend until he sorts himself out.  stand up for yourself and give prince charming a chance!|`|19TSkwaKaa	The idiot.  Hes just mad coz uve turned him down for sex!!!    Just ignore him. You can do what you lke, it doesnt always have to end in sexual contact with eachother!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	No.    Calling you frigid because you didn`t give in?    If you are not ready (or feel too young, or am uncertain) - it doesn`t happen - end of discussion.    I think you did right in breaking this off. He wants his way only, it would seem.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	he's  not right . you need to be right and move on.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	keepa way from him he is mean!!!|`|08y217Rdaa	He seems to think he owns you. Tell him to get lost. If he can't wait until he grows up, why should you? And what's all the whining about "trying" after you broke up? He could not accept the fact, that he never got the chance to get it off on you. Learn to forget and slam the door shut.|`|ytl2PONXaa	He's a waste    Get a different guy.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	yeah you were better off as friends thanlovers  you kiss your boyfriend alot|`|Sme8zvmDaa	dump him, he's a waste of time...|`|U2XCZHilaa	he is a moron. don't waste your time with him, he is a complete asshole, it's like his only after your looks and the things that he can be proud of doing with you. this guy is not even worth the worry, loving a person is understanding his/her limitations and feelings, moreover, giving him/her the greatest love that he/she can feel. don't even bother to fix things with him, he is not worth it.|`|s63U2ccFaa	I think he's stupid to be honest.Refuse to have sex because it's kinda stupid to call you frigid and then ask that.You could do way better than that. :)
65ojSBXgaa	Relax kiddo. If you really want this girl to become your best friend I say ask her, tell her how you feel. If you don’t know what to say? Say this: Hi, would you like to be my best friend in this entire world?  Or I think you are a cool person to hang around with, would you like to become my best friend? Pretty much that’s it. Also another thing you could do is get those best friends key chains or start with a charm bracelet those are always fun.  Relax ok smile and be confident!! See Ya!   -Gail (iz tha bomb)|`|5YdI3SAMaa	wait let me get this straight ...your  a boy?? in a gymnastics class?? hmm...well all i have to say is just be yourself...and try not to talk about gymnastics ^_^ ...
AA10529674	You did the right thing. She obviously doesn't want you in her life so it was good to let her know that you aren't friends with her anymore.<br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As2NaO_YTCRg2ayQ5Di8rQXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220120916AAd4xyM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|H6ErlcL1aa	To be honest, it does sound like you were overreacting. You'd think that by your third attempt you would have accepted that she didn't want to have contact with you, and respect her right to it. She probably felt a bit harrassed, and wondered why you were so adamant in contacting her repeatedly.
XBTF1XvZaa	All you need to do is to just keep it like that dont be the first to say it allow him to do first, because it's a man that suppose to ask you to go out with and he will have lot of respect for you but if u be the first Im sorry the reverse is the case. So just continue the way you people are. And if you see you cant keep the burden inside your heart the just said it loud and express how you feel for him if he understand you and think that the two of can make the relationship to be real then you are LUCKY..|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	It sounds like he likes you. Be his friend and see what happens!
NlxmeCWDaa	Dude one year my husband FORGOT  about my birthday!  I didn't say anything ALL day and then at 11 pm my son gave me a hug and says "happy birthday mom".  The look on my husbands face and the sshit I've been able to give him since then- it almost made it worth it!|`|4gve3I6Xaa	Definitely would feel the same!  <br>  You have got to tell him what you expect because most men are just totally blind and don't get it.  <br>  Or if you don't want to tell him directly, tell one of his friends or one of your friends and tell them to tell him...even though since he is your husband, you should be able to tell him directly.  <br>  And if all else fails, plan your own party!!  It can be just as fun!  Invite all your friends, or girlfriends over, and do what YOU like most!  <br>  Whatever you do, try to enjoy your birthday and to not be disappointed in however it turns out.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Men are not into planning parties and inviting people and getting the things for a party ready. That's more of a feminine thing for woman. Be happy to go out to dinner and that he did remember you. If you want something special you do have to throw out the hints about what you want way ahead and hope he pays attention.|`|i6KUtPXXaa	I'm not quite there yet but I would feel a little dissapointed that he didn't go through the whole planning and things for my party because parties make you feel like it is YOUR day and no one else's and make you feel special. So don't feel bad and happy 2 weeks early birthday! :)|`|rrWhhiMEaa	It wouldnt bother me, but I can understand why it bothers you.<br>  <br>  The thing is most men arent good with hints. It helps if you CLEARLY tell him what would make you happy and what you want and need from him, without necessarily asking him outright. Hopefully he will get the point and do something. I think that would mean more to you than having to "ask" him to do it.|`|AA10494978	Probably.  On my 34th everyone, I mean EVERYONE forgot my birthday.  I didn't hear one person even say happy b-day until about a week later.  I know people are busy, still pissed me off.  <br>  <br>  Its normal to feel the way you do.  But give him a chance to make it up to you on your 31st.|`|O1b7das7aa	No, would not be disappointed. But that is just me.<br>  <br>  We do not do Christmas presents, birthday presents, Valentine's Day, etc. These "holidays" for most people are nothing more that cards, gifts and Hallmark moments. That's not our thing.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You just have to accept him and love him for who he is. If you are going to be upset without a party, ask for one! He can't be a mind-reader|`|CIyuis2haa	I'm glad not to have birthday parties. I got over that when I was 8. If you want a party, have a party. You don't need a reason.|`|NPAQxqgNaa	I personally wouldn't care.  As long as someone acknowledges it's my birthday then it's all good.  I didn't want my wife to do anything big even when it was my 30th.|`|fBFNCS1Naa	No. I'm 31 years old and I don't really care about my birthdays, nor do I need parties in my honor.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Why don't you and one of your friends plan your party?  There is nothing wrong with that!  Have fun!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I haven't wanted a birthday party or celebration of it , since my 26th birthday. And my husband is pretty much the same. If you really want a party, plan it yourself.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	That's a tough one. But you said yourself that he had an excuse for not planning a party and if it was something you really wanted then you should have let him know. My husband turned 30 last year and he was SO mad at me because I wasn't making a big deal about it and didn't have anything planned for his birthday. Of course he wasn't expecting the big surprise party I had planned at our house after I had taken him out for a nice birthday dinner. I was well aware that if I didn't plan something he wasn't going to be happy so I did what I had to do to make it happen. <br>  Your husband should have done the same regardless of his "excuse". My 30th is this year and I've already told my husband I want to have a party. My birthday is New Years Eve so we can have a combo birthday/NYE party. I'm letting him know so he doesn't drop the ball. If you want a party this year, tell him and let him take care of it. You can't expect men to just know these things because they aren't paying attention half the time. I love my husband dearly but sometimes he doesn't have a clue what I want so I just make it a point to tell him so we're always on the same page. I think your feelings are justified and nobody wants to feel forgotten on their birthday. So tell him what you want and let him take it from there...hopefully he'll make it a special day for you!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	He took you out to dinner that should have been enough.  Why don't you just plan your own birthday party, it doesn't always have to be a surprise.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	My hubby doesn't like birthdays or parties so I never do anything big for him other than drinks or karaoke with our friends.  But he knows that I like to do something on my birthday so he makes that effort.|`|AA10197672	I would be but as you love him a lot you get over it...|`|jKDZlgMiaa	My bf's family is the same - they never do much for bdays. In MY family, bdays were always a big deal.<br>  <br>  So you've got different ways of doing things. Have you told him how important it is to you? That's what's important - whether or not he listens to you and takes you seriously. <br>  <br>  And yes, I'd feel the same. That's why I've gotten to the point where I plan my OWN bday celebrations  :)|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	It's YOUR birthday, if you want a huge blowout plan it yourself. what's the big deal? <br>  <br>  on my 30th the last thing i wanted was to be reminded i was 30! i think i spent the day in bed w/Ben & Jerry!|`|AA12382198	Tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want a birthday party....and if necessary help him to plan it.<br>  <br>  You're old enough to know that one day doesn't mean too much.....not when it comes to sharing a life with someone who usually is perfect for you.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	I feel your pain.  I threw my husband a 50th birthday party.  But he hardly even remembers mine. I don't know. Maybe it's a guy thing.  On Valentines day he got his mother flowers and spent the day with her, go figure.|`|NGKwsawdaa	so you're still upset about something that happened a year ago? If you really want a party then tell him. Men sometimes don't have a clue unless you clue them in, throw him some hints that you want  a party.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Nope!

Sounds like you should dump him though, sounds like he's using you no offense.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	He's a guy and he's horny that's why he still wants to. You can be a virgin and shave, it's only a hygiene thing. For guys it's a turn on. As far as the fake boobs go, I wouldn't concern myself with it. Real deal is always the best. Hey if he has a problem with your boobs then he has issues. Guys are visual creatures for the most part. They don't get into what is really what. If they like the look the go with that. It's silly but that is how they are wired<br>  I say try the shaving thing, if you're comfortable with it. To hell with the fake boobs|`|tY1gSfN4aa	he probably didn't mean it in a bad way! i don't think he would purposely say anything to make you feel that way, especially if you're so close that you're thinking about sex n all that...it doesn't sound like you have to worry about anything. its not like he said he wasn't attracted to you. he was probably just saying like his fantasy girl or something haha...but you should consider shaving, cause hair is gross lol...n if he really does have a problem with your body, then he probably doesn't really like you that much anyway, so get rid of him. if he loves you, it shouldn't make a difference.|`|AA10494978	OK, first of all, if you went all the way, you are not a virgin anymore.  Second, he is a teenager!  (I'm assuming).  He is horny.  He would do it with anyone who is there.  <br>  <br>  No, there is nothing you can do.  You have to be yourself.  Either he finds you attractive or he doesn't.  Its NOT YOUR PROBLEM!  Its his problem.  Tell him to quit playing games and grow up.  <br>  <br>  All you can do is be yourself.  YOu have to be comfortable with that.  Don't base your self image on what othe people say. I know, at that age, easier said than done.|`|KM50wTbHaa	it seems like he wants YOU. he likes you and though he likes that stuff he wants to be with You. And plus most guys have their little fantasies.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	I think your kind of letting him push you around, you should be able to be who ever you want to be without worring about if he likes it or not.|`|zfKzLFgxaa	he likes the opposite of you????!!! what???!!! that means he doesnt like you!! he just wants sex.... guys will have sex with pretty much anyone, thats why he still wants to have sex|`|88K49bvraa	sex games just experiment just be a tease|`|fnEv1p30aa	ok<br>  shave ur *****<br>  then ur done<br>  :)|`|p2r1fGREaa	honestly your boyfriend is just being a "boy" they think that being fake is beautiful when in fact it is not.  I'm sure you are a beautiful human being, and God does not make mistakes, you are you, and for a reason.  Don't ever change to make someone like you, if he still wants to sleep with you then obviously he does find some attraction to you, just because you don't have fake boobs or look like barbie does not mean you are not a sexy gorgeous woman.  Love what you have God gave to you be proud of it, if he doesn't like it screw him, you'll find a ton of guys who think you are the best thing since sliced bread.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	First, it's rude for the guy to tell his g-friend that his favorite body type is the opposite of what the girl has.  He should tell you that you're exactly what he likes.  Since he's a knitwit, he has alot of growing up to do.  Secondly, all guys like sex, it's just that good.  If he is already doing it w/ you, you are turning him on.  Don't do anything else to change yourself.|`|Hzb2dOxcaa	Guys are jerks! You should totally be in control of yourself and if he doesn't like you tell him to get lost! Hes just desperate for any kind of sex with anyone by the sounds of it! If he admitted he likes the oppisite of you i dont know why you tolorate him! Talk to him upfront and think about if he's the one you should lose your virginity to. Good luck :)|`|EiZ69tYmaa	be yourself...that has to be enough for him because if you pretend to be something you are not then you will be unhappy and he sounds like a hit it and quit it type. there are better men out there and you should not limit yourself to this one judgemental person. as  far as sex goes...he does not need a reason to have sex he needs an opportunity YOU CAN AND WILL DO BETTER!|`|yFMy10CEaa	He wants to have sex with you cuz thats what guys want to do...no matter what. Personaly, you dont need to be losing your V-card at 16 to some dumbass kid but thats just my opinion.

Careful because he just might use you to satisfy his needs. You're still young but do you think it's worth giving it up to a guy who doesn't love you for who you are? I'll leave that decision up to you.|`|hJx0F1maaa	dint change for him, you want him to want you as your are dont feel the need to change.|`|LsRHE4Ttaa	break up with him he only wants you for the sex im sirious and you shouldn't be having sex anyways your16!|`|TN3U8KSBaa	i dont think your relationship is really gonna work girly.....x<br>  <br>  youll find someone better..x|`|8Rwd1zGFaa	16 and sex? damn girl ur crazy<br>  <br>  <br>  \|`|OOwUlO4Jaa	Hi, firstly, I would like to say "don't be confussed" he is the one that seems to be changing his mind. Its good that you want to be the best for him but please dont go and change yourself if you are not comfortable in doing it. Being smooth down below may be a turn on for guys and it is perfectly reasonable for you to want to do that. shaving is not the best answer, there are many creams and things on the market also waxing is quite common in women, (sounds a bit painful) If you want to be a "Turn On" for him try taking control of the situation and that will blow his mind. I could tell you how to treat him and let you in on a few amazing places to touch him, dont forget you can also touch yourself. What you want to get into is total freedom in the bedroom, Freedom to explore his and your own bodies together, a blindfold is also a great thing for him to wear, lay him on his front and then gently blow, kiss and touch him, this will get every nerve ending more sensative and it will be a great turn on for him. this would also work well for you, if you could get him to do this to you, its so amazing to give and recieve just a non-sexual touch so softly. to run your hand up his legs starting from the knee and stopping just before you touch his organs will blow his mind. if you do this a few times so softly then after about 3 or 4 times you want to make sure you do it again with your finger-nails digging in to him, I just hope he dont shoot his load before you get your fun. Be careful, sexual health and all that but treat him and yourself with respect. good luck.|`|u7HtSOqtaa	Everybody has different things they're attracted to, but it doesn't necessarily make them requirements.  It's kind of like when you find a certain celebrity attractive; you're turned on by them, but you have to remember to be realistic.  The majority of people in the world don't have the perks of being primped and pampered 24/7.  The most important thing is to just be yourself and be comfortable in your own skin.  There's nothing sexier than confidence. Anyone worth having in your life is going to love you no matter what.  If they can't accept you for who you genuinely are, then they're not even worth your time.
mFZeEm9paa	I was married at age 18 because like you I thought it was all perfect and the way I felt was like never before. I had my daughter when I was 19, and I had 2 more kids by the time I was 24. We divorced after 8 years because we were too young when we got married and we were just two totally different people.<br>  <br>  I think that you are smart getting engaged and waiting two years, if you can stick by it. I am not saying that all couples married young ends badly, but you need to take the time to really make sure that you are making the right choice for YOU... I know lots of success stories too from couples married young, so it can go either way, just make sure that you are confident in your decision. When you have no doubts that you are doing the right thing, then you probably are ok.|`|AA12382198	I love the part about being engaged for at least 2 years.<br>  <br>  You will both have enough time to have seen the best and the worst in each other.......and then make a good decision if you still want to spend your lives together.<br>  <br>  Just a tiny bit of advice.....don't try to plan every little thing.....leave some room to just let things happen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Wait til you both graduate school and get your careers underway before you even think of marriage.  Things change a lot as you get older and settled into careers.<br>  <br>  If I married the guy I was engaged to at 21, I would surely be divorced now.  We are both such different people now.|`|4ThvQYi9aa	I think you are very sensible and smart. If you really love each other then you should get engaged but I think it is a good idea to wait to get married. The thing that most young people don't understand is that marriage is not a picnic. It is hard work and sometimes you don't get anything in return. Being married is actually really boring and it isn't always full of passion and excitment. Some days you won't even be able to stand being in the same room as your husband. The trick is to work through you problems instead of ignore them and promise to stick together no matter what.|`|dbQHlp85aa	wait at least a year to even get engaged... what's the rush.. if you're not planning on getting married for another 2 years anyway... <br>  <br>  long engagements are dangerous... it leaves too much time for people to change their minds or you 2 may change into something the other doesn't like. <br>  <br>  Engagements are not time to get to know one another.. it's time to plan a wedding and a year long engagement is long enough. <br>  <br>  You should take the time to do more getting to know each other before you even get engaged. <br>  <br>  But I'm happy that you feel you've found the one. And if he really is the one, what's the rush? You know he'll be there anyway right? Just wait a year before you get engaged.|`|ogFPGxpXaa	YES.          <br>  <br>  <br>  ........|¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨...<br>  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__<br>  ........|__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|Po1QAWTnaa	bf not husband why cant yall get it this is for marriage divorce and weddings you should be in single etc|`|yHORVSJdaa	yes|`|utGddhnVaa	giver

I used to get it. Not a lot, because it didn't hurt and it was only if I did something REALLY bad. And it happened rarely. And I hate it happening to other people. I honestly think this is abuse.

I think you should tell somebody.|`|KchNxZ6yaa	That Girl Got Of Easy I Used To Get Badly Braid Punched Kicked Head Smashed Of Tables (Once A Glass Table) But I Never Cryed .........Or For That I Never Cry When My Freinds Get Tolt Off   Well Peece Dude Or Dudet|`|zWwJR3rFaa	No I would not cry.

eTx3Nfd7aa	hey this woman has given you the best years of her life maybe she is a little out of line but its her house and we all have bad days maybe instead of getting all attitude with her you could ask her what is wrong maybe she is upset over something.if she has brought you up on her own i think she deserves some time for her and you are being selfish.kids today don't know they are born i didn't have a mobile at your age and i had to do household chores just because i lived there its called being part of a family all kids do today is moan about how unfair life is poor you you have a home heating food a good mum think yourself lucky.trouble with kids today they think they are the only ones with a life or problems the whole world does not revolve round you beleive it or not.Well you came on y/a to get answers and thats my opinion my mum drives me nuts and she can be argumentative and obnoxious but shes my mum and one day she wont be here.your mum is the best friend you will ever have quit moaning.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Your language is appalling, she should put you across her knee like the 5 yr old you behave like.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Yeah. Try being respectful. Don't swear at her. Do what you are told with no eye rolling. No slamming doors.<br>  Don't tell me you aren't a troublesome kid. Your nasty attitude would give any mother fits.<br>  <br>  So tell her you are sorry. Try to find out why SHE is feeling the way she is without the bad attitude.|`|fa67678351ca64a78765e4b86da99c89aa	u seem very sensible for 14, so why not in the morning ask her to sit with you  for 5 mins so you can talk over what has happened tonight.<br>  <br>  You will be feeling totally stressed at the moment with schooling and should mention this but ask her why she is threatening you with sending you to live somewhere else as its not fair on you that she is saying these words if she knows how u feel.  If its done often<br>  <br>  Try talking things over with child-line if you think the situation is getting worse or you want to talk 2 some1 in confidence that can offer you advice  0800 1111  - but this is a stage that most teenagers go through  - arguing is a part of it|`|mMLci6LSaa	Try to have some sympathy for her.  Most of the time when people act angry the way you described, it is because they are unhappy about their own lives.  If she is unhappy, then you should pity her instead of scorning her.  It helps to react with compassion rather than hatred.  This will be good for you, as well as for her.|`|vCtCW8ODaa	you only ever have one mother, slagging her off isn't helping you or her, she's brought you up alone and thats not easy, especially if she is holding down a job as well, she could have all sorts of worries and problems to deal with that you don't know about, so try and keep calm and go easy on her, you may not say these things to her face but she will sense the atmosphere so for the sake of a peaceful homelife try and get along with her.  It wont be long before you are off out into the world and away from all the problems.<br>  <br>  and yes i do see where you are coming from i had a very difficult mother (she is in her 80s now and still a nightmare) but i have also been a mum and a single one at that so know how hard life can be bringing up a child alone|`|LNsrWDKmaa	It sounds to me like your mother is upset and stressed out about something else and taking it out on you.  It's hard as a single parent with no one else to lean on.  Did she go away with a boyfriend and things didn't go well?  Did she go away on work?  Is she having problems with her job or boss? Is she worried about money.  With no one else to help , these can cause irriitability.  <br>  <br>  Why dont you say that you notice that she is upset and that you want her to be happy so you are wondering if there is anything you can do to help.  If you are there to share her burdens, you will get her joy and support as well. You might just find that she is feeling bad about something and has no one to tell.  This is your chance to have a great relationship with her, but it is up to you to turn it around.<br>  <br>  Try some compassion. You will then be acting as an adult and not as a child.|`|vh7ykvmHaa	I acted like you when I was a teenager. Now I am a parent I realise how much you love your children and how much you do for them. Your Mum is a person like everyone else and has her bad days too. She will snap on her bad days but you should be there for her.<br>  Have you thought that prehaps she is upset about your argument too? One day you will realise how hard it is to be a parent and that you just want the best for your child. Say thanks once in a while as she was the one up all night when you were a baby which I promise is not easy. I know being a teenager is hard I also know for the record being a single Mum is extremly hard work and can be very lonely. Show your Mum you love her, she needs your love and support as much as you need hers. Be forgiving on her off days, give her a hug and she prob realise she is snapping and will chill!
IsRk5ZoVaa	wow!<br>  that sounds like a complete **** honestly i think she has feelings for you and you should just give it up to her thats not a way too show you still have feelings for someone/ if you like let her know that she doesnt have too do all this stuff for you too like her you know.<br>  you like someone cuz of the person not the sexual things,<br>  talk to her and tell her.! :)|`|AA10054552	My advice stay away from this girl. She is either doing these things to make a fool out of you . She wants to prove to some one else she can get you to do those things and she is trying to either ipress someone else or she is using you to make a fool out of some one else.<br>  Play it smart finding a girl that you don't have to guess with and then if you hold on to that one long enough this one will show her true colors

zWYfAWSOaa	First of all your Dad saw all this occuring, agreed to the homeschooling and never stood up for you? He is just as much to blame as your mom for not advocating for your best interest.  Your post was well-written. Obviously, you learned something homeschooled.  You are only 20. You can attend community college and get your GED. You have options.  <br>  <br>  Join a women's group at your church or in the community.  There are lots of women who can help you learn how to be a proper mother.  A woman family counselor might be perfect. You need counseling if you will have a prayer of negotiating your "mother issues" that will arise with the birth of child.<br>  <br>  God Bless you and your baby.  You have a lot to enjoy and look forward too.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	I'm sorry you had to live like that in your youth. I don't know if you can ever have a real relationship with your Mother. I'm sorry, but I can't imagine growing up like that. You probably need some help. I think you are taking the first step by talking about it to others. Maybe once you get all this off of your chest, you can start to heal. Has your Mother ever told you that she was sorry? If she's really changed, then that is her first step. I wish you all the best and I'm so glad you have a friend in your husband. I think once you are a Mother, you will be fine without any help. Just try to stay strong. You'll make it!|`|dcovK6oqaa	You know I know how you feel, my own mother was a witch to me. and even thought she apologizes I just can't Truly forgive her, She would also bit me up for nothing.

Me and my mother and sister went to live with her. she was abusive to us, she wouldn't feed us, or cloth us. she would buy everything for herself, and she would let her boyfriend molest me. I could never really for give her. Today sometimes, I steal have nightmares. perhaps you should let it out, tell her how much she really hurt you. I have done that with my mother.I really can't give you advise here because I can relate to you.|`|f9soMMuiaa	I don't. I just try to best to distance from her.

This is my life story!! The mother, the ended engagement, my age, and my pregnancy!<br>  <br>  My mother did all the same things to me, and now that I'm gone (I moved out on my own at 16) she is the most caring, loving woman ever! She quit her job to be a "full-time" grandmother!!  She watches  my 4 nieces and nephews and loves it! Actually, I was so used to being called a slut and whore, I was terrified of telling her about my pregnancy. She was elated!!<br>  <br>  I tried to push my mother out of my life, but I realized she truly has turned over a new leaf. Its very hard for me to trust her, although my siblings don't find it odd. It may because they're boys and were in High School by the time I was born. I've slowly accepted this over the course of 2 years. She does seem to be genuine. The only possible explanation I have is that my mother had a mental illness (quite possibly bi-polar disorder) and it has since "leveled out". Menopause may have an effect on this, because thats when she became normal.|`|aCiW36l8aa	i am soo sorry this happened to you! i wish things had not happen to be that way. you cant stop your mother from seeing your kid. i mean you can but it would not be so nice it is infact her grandson. honestly if it were up to me i would tell her how she felt when she was hitting you, calling you slut, etc. tell her how would she feel is she was in that position or how would she feel if she saw her grandson in that position try for your mother to make it up to you. if it were my choice i would let her see him/her every month one a friday|`|n8MnzRp1aa	i recently had a baby.

I would just keep a watchful eye and not let her get to you. Show her that your the mom she wasn't.
zkcAhXf0aa	okay its actually wrong, but there are certain aspects that can make it become a bad idea, one the girl may begin to like you and then well....you know what will happen, then theres the second your friend may accuse you of trying it with her,(useually because kids around school will see you with her and do gossip), trust me its not a bad idea but its not really worth the threat the hassel.

xcxMB4Rlaa	I've been a bridesmaid 4 times<br>  <br>  First wedding- I was 17, it was my brother's wedding, I wore a shimmery gold & burgundy gown<br>  <br>  Second wedding- I was 18, it was a friend's wedding, I wore a periwinkle gown<br>  <br>  Third wedding- I was still 18 (one month later), it was an associate's wedding, I wore a champagne gown<br>  <br>  Fourth wedding- I was 22, it was my best friend's wedding, I wore a royal blue gown<br>  <br>  I'm scheduled to be in a wedding in 4 months and another in about 14 months. I'm looking forward to seeing what I'll be wearing to those.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Cousin's wedding, I was about 12 - red dress (Christmas wedding)<br>  <br>  College friend's wedding, I was 22 - black dress with white bodice and black detailing (black-and-white wedding)<br>  <br>  College friend's wedding, I was 23 - aqua dress (beach wedding)<br>  <br>  Best friend's wedding, I was 24 - black cocktail dress of my choosing ("casual elegant" wedding, and definitely my favorite to dress for!)|`|AA11082914	A few times. One I wore a crushed velvet hunter green long sleeved dress (was a quick, thrown together wedding, the bride chose colors that everyone already owned- the dress had been my homecoming or winter formal dress the previous year), 2nd and 3rd times I wore a peri spaghetti strap satin dress with chiffon around the neckline (was able to recycle...lol), and last time, a navy blue strapless dress with split front and beading. I've lucked out- all the dresses I've worn in weddings have been "recycled" except one!|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Yes, I wore a pink and blue dress. A pink corset type top with blue beading and blue A-line skirt with a pink chiffon overlay.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I was  Jr. Bridesmaid at my aunt's wedding. We all had maroon dresses.  They were nice, but very plain.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	I wore cream for my cousins wedding and was 9. I loved being bell of the ball!|`|hBDbuKToaa	Yes, twice.  Once I was 11 and I wore a brown turtleneck velvet dress with short sleeves (sounds worse then it was), and last year I was one again.  This time the color of choice was pink, and not in a flattering cut...wonderful, beautiful wedding, but the dress ruined my night...Neither one was the most special day.|`|8g51eBf1aa	I was the oldest flower girl ever (17) I basically was a bridesmaid but anyway I wore a spaghetti strap pink dress with layers of ruffels.

bmoCpcdraa	dump him he wants to be free to run like a teenager, or start leaving  him with kid and go out evry time. you know girls night out and see how he likes it, i hope i helped|`|AA11513689	hm, how about telling him he is acting like a child.<br>  Listen, he has a child,ok?That means he needs to ACT like an adult, and that means he't not going to have all the fun he had when he didn't have a child!<br>  HE has to provide for it, he has to care for it (a job, taking care of her, providing for YOU)<br>  He thinks he's being 'controlled'?<br>  MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE HAVING A CHILD!<br>  Either send him on his way, or make him shape up.<br>  he doesn't sound worth it,from what I'm reading.|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Sorry to say this but you people need Counselling
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Honestly honey I know you think you are very mature but you can't be.  You just said you two had barely hit 2 months when he asked you to marry him--however at barely 5 months (which is nothing, no time what so ever) his parents told him to call it off and he did.<br>  <br>  That doesn't show maturity.  How do you handle adversity?  Do whatever someone tells you?  Sorry babe but he is not ready for this type of seriousness no matter what he said after knowing you 30 days.  I bet it was a joke--not an actual proposal.<br>  <br>  You've been taking care of everyone for so long.  You need to figure out what you need out of life.  What do you require in a relationship?  I doubt you can possibly know this after a couple dates.  You've been exclusively committed to the first guy that caught your fancy.  But now that you are single again, you will discover numerous other guys that can catch your fancy. <br>  <br>  Remember statistics are the majority of people.  Stats don't lie.  The majority of people who marry during their teenage years divorce.  The highest divorce rate is with teenagers.  The lowest is educated people in after 25.  There are several reasons for this.  You've been taking care of everyone but you don't have the ability to financially support yourself.  He has no college education and you don't either.  People who have a college education on average make 1 million more over their lifetime.  Money is the number one cause for divorce.<br>  <br>  I was with the love of my life at 15 and we were both going to college.  That wasn't an option.  I always said if it was meant to be it would be.  If we were still single and wanted to be together when we graduated, we'd get back together.  We did and we were right.  But since we'd known each other 10 years, we recognized we had both changed a lot.  We knew each other better than most couples do.  We knew it was meant to be at 15 but if it was meant to be at 15 it would still be meant to be at 25.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yeah, and you're still too young. It doesn't matter how mature you think you are. The fact is that neither of you are done growing up yet. And you won't be for a few more years. When you get married you can't do this on again, off again crap. The fact that you haven't been able to get your situation together over the past 4 years is good sign not only that you aren't ready to be married, but that you don't work as a couple. Getting married would be a mistake no matter when you did it.|`|AA10197672	Hell no - he was only 17 what does he know what he wants that young? I'd say guys get ready and know what they want mid or late 20's. Same goes for you. You were very young too. You two need to date, get to know one another, go through some things in love. 16-17 is way too young to know if you really want to be together, then take your time, date get to know one anther and then commit...|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Absolutely not.  You do not know each other well enough, and I know you don't believe this, but in 10 years you will be almost nothing like you are now, and neither will he.  You can't know in advance that everything is going to work out.  You both need to experience life.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	I;ll go along with most hear you are very young relay think about it.That said at your age i wanted the same thing no one could stop us we were in love & still are 32 years later.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	I'm with his parents, you guys are nuts.  Who will provide for you both?|`|NGKwsawdaa	You made an excellent choice by not jumping into marriage. there is no rush, you both are still very young. date each other and date other people and in a few years maybe you guys will still feel the same way toward each other and then get married. You don't want to rush into a serious relationship without experiencing what else life has to offer.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	i think its ridiculous!! how bout growing up and maturing a bit!! how can you possibly have a successful marriage that young! why are young people thinking that's the cool thing to do!!! what ever happened to like promise rings or whatever!!! marriage is for adult that minds have matured and actually have starting to build a foundation of what and where they are headed in life! try going to college and enjoying being young bc those years will fly away and you will wish you enjoyed them to the fullest!!|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	This time it'll be 5 whole months? You know between that statement and all the exclamation points it is very obvious that you are not mature enough to get married. I wouldn't even have needed to know your actual age to figure that out. Wait until you're older.|`|AA10494978	NO!  You guys are way too young to be thinking about this.  When you turn 35 you will be pissed that you had a chance to do something when you were in your early 20s but you couldn't because you had 5 kids running around.  Your parents are right.  Go live your life for a while, go to college, go see the world.  You have plenty of time for marriage later.|`|XWetnjgkaa	Umm...marriage is WORK sweetheart. And at yalls age I highly doubt you know the meaning of that. Lets just say this, are you two still gonna be happy around one another when yall are getting on each others nerves? If you ever tell him something important to you and he acts like he doesnt care, can yall work it out?? Can you live with each other on a day to day basis and be happy? What about the famous line "for better or worse"?? See??? my point is you are way too young and Im glad you are putting it off...wait till ur at least 21.....at least.|`|AA10240683	You are way to young to get married. You have yet to experience a full life and you want to ruin it by marriage? Do not make the biggest mistake of your life at such a tender age.|`|yjmOaG1kaa	dO NOT MARRY YOUNG!! i did that and now i regreat it! (exept for my duaghter) you still have you're whole life ahead of you so why marry now when you can ruin your life later?!|`|PDAVQU3Caa	its a bit early to be thinking about that, give it a few more years atleast :)|`|2QS8j9aOaa	I think that at 16 your maturity level is very young and you should wait till you are at least 18 to make sure you don't make a mistake. If he loves you truly he will wait till you are ready and not pressure you at such a young age.
AA10457351	Depends completely on how you feel about the person you are married to ... Speaking from my own experience here, but I "setttled" when I married the first time - I loved my ex-husband, but wasn't "in love" which made me feel trapped in a relationship that I couldn't wait to get out of. <br>  <br>  I learned from that marriage, and I have never settled again for anyone less than what I expect and deserve. For that reason, I have remained single since my divorce preferring to "test the waters" before I ever make the same mistake twice. <br>  <br>  Point is .. You can be lucky in marriage when you truly love the person you choose but a loveless marriage can leave you feeling trapped. Make sense?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Lucky.  But, it really depends on who you marry.  Just make sure you choose a really cool, down to earth woman who is not going to nag you.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Depends on the relationship. For me it's fantastic. I couldn't imagine not being married.|`|cdQryr7paa	Trapped at first.<br>  She got pregnant (she claims it was an accident but I don't believe it)<br>  But we got married and worked hard at it.<br>  We raised 2 kids and now have a grandchild.<br>  After 21 years, I guess we were lucky to be able to work together to make it all come out OK.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Depends on the situation and the people. <br>  <br>  We dated 5 years before getting married. I think we are lucky to have found each other. Married 11 years.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Lucky to be with a guy who I really enjoy being with.<br>  <br>  Trapped when he pisses me off  ;)|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Depends on where you are in life. If you would rather just do your own thing and see your girlfriend when you want, then probably marriage isnt for you right now. If you marry when you are ready, to someone that you love then you are lucky, not trapped|`|JgvQDjf2aa	depends most of the time I am happy because I love him so much and other times when he does things that should make me very angry, I can feel trapped by that same love because no matter how much he hurts me (not physically) I am to worried about his feelings to get as angry as I should.|`|SIK58haraa	Most of the time I feel really lucky. but no relationship is perfect and there are times I get pissed off and feel trapped.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	It's soooooooo depressing.  Your life is pretty much over...but you keep living it over and over every day.|`|AA10240683	Trapped. It is an awful feeling.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	It depends on who your married to.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I think it depends on who you marry..
bmoCpcdraa	.you poor thing,you can have your boyfriend get a different job, you can move in with your parents are go move into a shelter for the homeless cause if you live under someone eles's roof then you need to go by there ruels. so do you take the child to school with you?why not ? you can go to an alternitive school and they have a built in day care,you choose to live off of others and complaine boo hoo, drop out of school get a job at min. wage pay a sitter and get your own place and pay your own bills. cause it sound like you want people to fill sorry for your mistakes and choices, if the people that you much off of or so bad then call your local salvaction army they will help you, god bless , i hope i helped|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Your perdicament is really, unfortunate and I hope that as many young people as possible read your post.  Preventing situations like the one you are in is why people are so against teen pregnancy.  You really need to get your education and now that you have a child it is vital.  Even if you can manage to get a job in a tough job market with little to no job experience and minimal education you will not be unable to earn enough to become independent and support your child and yourself.  Contact social services or call 211 and tell them your situation so they can point you int the direction of assistance with child care, income, education and housing.  Next, it sounds like you didn't want to listen to anyone so you didn't and now you are in a worse situation than you were before getting pregnant.  My mother used to say that a hard head makes for a soft a** and she was right.  I had a child out of wedlock too and it was hard but at least I was an adult (over 21).  You are still a child and don't have all the answers.  If I were you, especially since you say your mother does not have any substance abuse issues, if she will allow it you should move back home.  Afterall, she does have your best interest at heart.  You and your boyfriend have a whole lot of growing up to do.  Since you are kinda stuck, at some point you are gonna have to listen to somebody who has more life experience than you in order to become independent and self sufficient.  When you don't have any money your options are greatly limited.  You should not be focusing on your boyfriend.  You are a mother now and YOUR  CHILD MUST COME FIRST hild must come first -- not romandce, boyfriends or any thing else.  I also recommend that you seek counseling.|`|dcovK6oqaa	Don't you have a relative that can help you meanwhile. what about his′parents why can you move with them, and your boyfriend, he is responsible too. at least for the baby. He gets you pregnant and he doesn't even help you. I don't see him doing anything meanwhile you are stock with your alcoholic mother.  Were is the check that he told you about. how long has it been since than?|`|6ErVPePEaa	You need to get your baby out of that type on environment. You nor your child need to live with a drug addict. I know this is not a permanent solution but go get on section-8. They will move you up if you have a child and homeless. Can you live with a family member? My fiance does not get pay check stubs either. We just have to get copies of his paychecks and that usually works|`|JUEkTETAaa	you need to tell him it is time to move out or u need to go back home|`|1tGpvCJLaa	my question to u is what country do u live in?I ask this because i live in australia and there is alot of help from community service groups for young girls in ur position.I really think you need to move out and find a place of your own,give ur boyfriend the option of coming with u and i think that his answer will determine his commitment to you and your baby.Why do u want to leave him?is there any problems with ur relationship?if so maybe family counselling would help? You need all the support you can get so maybe leaving him isnt the best option.your absolutely right in wanting to get an education behind you,in the long run it will be best for u and ur baby.There is supportive accomodation for young mums with childhealth nurses on the premises that could give u alot of advice on raising babys without judgement,maybe you could look into that<br>  goodluck and please try get out of that house asap as living with an addict is no life for ur family
KaD0CRI7aa	no i wouldn't especially if he washed laundry|`|dbQHlp85aa	No... but what the heck... what more do you want? <br>  <br>  Did you ever tell him, "hey, I really appreciate everything you do for me, but what I really need is this...."? <br>  <br>  People are not mind readers, you have to tell them what you want. <br>  <br>  Communication is key.. but don't just leave because you feel like he's not doing enough.. maybe you're not doing enough.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If someone is going to leave their spouse because they don't express love in an "expected" way, (despite them expressing their love pretty clearly in plenty of other ways) then they're an idiot.  The world doesn't always work in ways that you would "expect".|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Loves me in a nice way<br>  Helps out with Children<br>  Financially helpful<br>  Doesn't smoke/drink<br>  Helps cook and clean<br>  Doesnt play video games<br>  isnt in a band<br>  is nice looking<br>  friendly<br>  smart<br>  charming<br>  handsome<br>  well mannered<br>  nice family<br>  good friends<br>  good education|`|AA10197672	Thats why you communicate with him and tell him how YOU 'd like to be shown love. Buy the book called Five Love Languages and both read it. You two clearly have different love languages and need to learn...|`|F0uLexezaa	you both need professional marriage counseling|`|85Aa4NHsaa	No I would learn to see the love he is expressing in his own way.|`|2vBYTCUDaa	I have looked at all of your questions that you have posted. It looks like you are looking for an excuse to get divorced. You should just do it. Obviously you aren't happy and you will hurt him more if you wait. I don't understand what your problem is. He loves you so much and will do anything for you. Why can't you see that and love him back? Maybe explain why you are "lonely in your marriage" to him. If you can't do that file for divorce. He deserves better.|`|7985765d6a74cb0a72eb5c2728025a86aa	Depends on what your "expected" way is.  If you want him to say I love you more often then just tell him.<br>  Many men find it hard to express their feeling in words but he sure seems to be telling you in many many other ways.  I am sure there are 100's of married women out there who wish their husband's did as much for them.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	No. Men are poor communicators. As long as I know he loves me, I am fine.|`|iD4ejChZaa	no, there's always hope he would change in that 'expected way'.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	in general, things end up working out for the better.|`|MuzqSYjwaa	Have you tried telling him how you want to be loved?  TALK it really works.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	My wife is that way|`|avpv7u8saa	I'll love him back|`|mMLci6LSaa	Possibly.  I'm sort of feeling the same thing about my boyfriend.  He does so many great things for me, and treats me really well, but I still feel like I need  more.  I want banter, conversation, little notes left for each other, emails when we are apart, text messages, say "I love you" after sex, things like that.  He can make me breakfast all he wants, but if he doesn't reply to my text during the day, I am going to feel alone.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if this is the sort of thing you are experiencing, but I would suggest talking to him about it, and maybe suggesting therapy, before plunging into divorce.  He sounds like a good guy, maybe he just doesn't know what it is you expect.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	just tell him you feel like he's not expressing his love like you would like. marriage requires a lot of communication. talk to him before you jump to any conclusions but i wouldnt bring up the subject of leaving him. that might give him the wrong impression like you dont love him anymore. he sounds really nice and like he would love to sit down and talk to you about this. good luck, i hope you have many blessed years of marriage with this man and i hope he loves you very much ^.^ also i hope i helped :P|`|QYbMxFE0aa	Umm.. No. You can't judge some one by what YOU expect. That would be like buying a newborn puppy from a store and expecting it to come home house trained. He shows you he loves you by treating you like a princess. He loves you or he wouldn't do those things for you. You cant hold it against him that he doesn't sprinkle rose petals on your bed sheets or turn on Barry White when you get home from work. You have a good guy and if you don't see it then let him go so someone CAN appreciate him!!|`|JEpLjnGhaa	I'm a man... So i'm pretending your saying wife.<br>  <br>  But i would leave her. I don't care how many good or bad habits she has, as long as she loves me for me, and not look at another man...<br>  <br>  Well i have found my true love.<br>  <br>  why is a girl like that so hard to find may i ask?|`|99teIRU7aa	NO! I get where your coming from! Just explain your dream way to be loved, tell him to be romantic! No divorce! my parents are divoreced,it distyoed my life!|`|IHDVQs3kaa	If his failure to express feelings is his only shortcoming, and if you love him, why would you leave him?|`|NQoyNWaUaa	No I would tell him what I need from him and then if he still fails I will leave.|`|h2IXmQZYaa	just ask him about it|`|S9UhPRvAaa	give him a ******** problem solved|`|d5KW3h0Iaa	I would change my expectations|`|DCcumpkOaa	say hi when he comes home from work|`|NRfqivKPaa	lol uhhhh whats my expected way?

mlAFvumUaa	twilight books are awful anyways|`|POHWTDPRaa	You seem to have a remarkable capacity to care about things that don't matter. I can't really tell what your problem is, on account of the question being worded so poorly, but if you spit in any direction you are going to hit a Twilight fan. If you're pissed off that she's copying you, let it go. She isn't copying anyone. Those books are formulaic garbage specifically designed to be loved by young girls. She is into them for the same reason you are - It was decided for you that you would be. And the phone you have is probably the same phone every third teenage girl has. Get over it.<br>  <br>  Now to totally ruin your party, if you're getting this mad at her over something so insignificant, she isn't going to be your best friend forever. But she wasn't going to be anyway. You will graduate high school and forget all about each other.|`|0le6RYndaa	1. Learn proper grammar.<br>  <br>  2.  Grow up.

She can do that too. Why must it be a competition? Why are you so angry about something as insignificant as this?<br>  You should have just said something like "oh, is that a bookmark with Edward on it? That's so cool!" or something like that. Then she would have smiled and said "yeah, you're reading them too?" Or something. See? You could have avoided this dilemma completely, rather than getting mad and giving her a quiz on the book to show her you know more about it. That's silly.<br>  Maybe she started being " aB**** " because you started being mean to start with. So you should start off by apologising, say something like, "I'm sorry I was mean the other day, I was having a bad day. I'm glad you are reading Twilight too now because we can talk about it together. I'm sorry." But you have to really mean it.

vdGZkyYYaa	Yeah i agree with you, if your getting good grades in school i don't see what the problem is. In Europe people start drinking a lot earlier than in the States, which makes them more tolerant! Every normal teenager will go to parties and get drunk, to say you shouldn't drink before 21 is extremely unrealistic!|`|o1rzGR8kaa	OK I come, we party, bring fermented camel milk|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I'm with your mother on this one.<br>  <br>  It's not that she has an issue with you letting off steam, enjoying yourself and having fun with your friends, she has a problem with you drinking.<br>  <br>  Sweetheart, there's a reason.<br>  <br>  Having seen firsthand the damage that alcohol can do to families and relationships, and how young girls just lose all control and inhibitions and sleep with any disgusting crawler with a penis, and end up with an unplanned pregnancy (and that's only if they're luck, the nasty diseases spread by unprotected sex just don't bear thinking about), and are sometimes even raped because their judgement is so impaired by the alcohol and they are incapable of fighting their rapist off, or even calling for help. <br>  <br>  Your mother wants you to be safe. <br>  <br>  As it happens, I think that drinking so much at 15 is a very bad idea, and being so reliant on alcohol at such a young age in order to be able to have fun is NOT living life, it's only kidding yourself that you have a life. You don't have to drink when you go out, you know. And you can still have a good time.|`|zYqHaDcmaa	I personally agree with your mother. You are only 15. Another 6 years before you are legally drinking- especially without your parent's permission/supervision. It is illegal and it doesn't matter how hard you work. You can have fun other ways. How about the movies? Or shopping? Going to the spa?|`|7PbJWEo1aa	your 15. 15 year olds should not be drinking apart from with family.<br>  <br>  look at it from her view.<br>  <br>  you will get a reputation - and if its a small down you aught to reconsider your actions.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	no, when you have kids you'll understand|`|8DhmRwMraa	bc ur under age and its wrong to drink at 15!|`|rffdGwB9aa	That is absolutely ridiculous. You should not be drinking! You are SIX YEARS underage! Drinking can make you do stupid things, and if you think your mother is being unreasonable by saying you will be grounded on the weekends if you break the law, then so be it! You are BREAKING THE LAW for god's sake! Just because there is nothing to do does not mean that you have to drink! Find something else to do. Or at least party withouth he drinking. And this is not coming from an adult's point of view, I'm thirteen.|`|IARYnu6zaa	If you do drink every weekend, she isn't really being unreasonable, shes just trying to look out for you.<br>  If you still wanna drink, go out, get pissed and stay at a mates?|`|3qUvC6Draa	didn't read what you wrote.<br>  <br>  your mum always knows best for you.<br>  <br>  have a lovely day.|`|v0P0vay0aa	..................................|`|z5nh670Qaa	she isnt being unreasonable, she's just watching over you. moms are like that when it comes to that stuff.|`|53sVKcOeaa	4000 consider yourself lucky try living in a village with an expensive corner shop and a butchers which is only open in the morning. Both closed sunday. You think your bored get over it, walk places get a train or bus if you have a transport service. You don't need to drink to keep yourself from being bored. Your mums looking out for you, you can get liver failure from drinking like that, it will affect you in later life, if not now. Just do what she says don't drink this weekend then you can get hammered the next week. She's not being unreasonable just sounds like you have a drinking problem.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You may not like to hear this, but no, your mother is not being unreasonable.<br>  <br>  Have fun without alcohol - it is possible you know, all you do is stay sober and watch everybody else making fools of themselves!<br>  <br>  It is your mother's job to make sure you reach 18 years old without being pregnant, arrested, or addicted to drugs or alcohol - she is trying to make sure she does a good job.<br>  <br>  If you want to get drunk when you are an adult - you can do that, but hopefully by that time you will have grown more sensible and responsible.|`|aCiW36l8aa	are you stupid? you dont drink at 15.... lets see what you become at age 21

Gross, like I wanted to know that.  We're adults for christ sake.  Now when I go down on him, I keep thinking about it, and he wonders why I don't want to do it.|`|3WzvuPB4aa	One of the first times we ever had sex, my girlfriend called me by her ex's name.

OEUxi6lcaa	Multiple men. Usually in an anonymous setting involving bondage such as blindfold, gag, chains or ties of some sort around ankles and wrists, I've also heard about this helmet thing that blocks out all senses such as smell, sound, and sight. That would be cool too. A couple of different flogging materials. And then make it non-consentual.|`|hlJ1AXBDaa	well i kinda lived it out, me a girl and a man<br>  <br>  but i would love to get spanked which i dont thinks been done yet even though he said he would! hehe|`|3WzvuPB4aa	I'm kind of torn.

We'd be alone and I'd be scared, so he'd act all cool as if he wasn't thinking about it, and give me chocolates with fruit filling in the center.

XVljoYZ5aa	Maybe he can't "just get over it". Often women who date older men are looking for someone to take care of them, or fill a "daddy" role. This may worry him. Don't get me wrong, sometimes we just want to date a mature, made man.<br>  <br>  Men on the other hand can have a youth complex when dating younger women (and 20 years is substantial), and he may not "get over" this because its a part of who he is, and why he's with you.|`|IARYnu6zaa	It all depends on how old you are.<br>  He shouldn't really be worried, as he is your boyfriend and wouldn't be with you if he didn't care for you, it might just take him a little longer to adjust to the age difference than you did.<br>  He'll be okay with time.
vvVrbB4Daa	yes, he likes you. he's nervous to ask you though, that's why he asked someone that's close to you and that knows you well. if he doesnt know that you know that he's thinking about asking you out, ask him out before he asks you. it'll make the relationship better, trust me.<br>  good luck :)|`|Or6mIS96aa	umm... that happens to me alot its the exact same thing and he just told me he asked  my ex best friend if he should it means he really likes you but doesnt know how to tell you if by a few days he doesn't ask him out go for it and you ask him out|`|fb5d7O6Saa	Maybe he does.

That is the only payment you are giving her for thousands of dollars a month in luxuries. Even this question makes you sound rather immature, especially that you are not understanding her point.<br>  <br>  She is saying you are acting older than you should, which means that you are acting in such a way that she believes conveys the message that you have some value or importance that you have not earned, or demanding respect you don't deserve.

nqINitkmaa	We got engaged September 2008 and we are getting married August 2009. Everyone is different, my brother was engaged for 5 years before they got married. Do what feels right for you. That's really responsible of you to realize that year might be too soon because your not financially ready, maybe wait 2, that way you will be done with college and established into a career. Perfect time to get married! CONGRATS!!|`|JAdNkzENaa	girl i have been engaged since october of 2006! if you want a certain type of wedding and dont want to go into debt because of it, you just wait. there is no shame in that.<br>  when people ask you when the date is just tell them you arent sure yet. no big deal you can wait 3 years if you like|`|pub2GLZPaa	We waited a year and a half before getting engaged.<br>  <br>  I am 27, he is 30, we are both well established already and didn't want to rush into anything, despite how "good" things feel :)<br>  <br>  I would wait. Not that you're too young, but there is no fire, and it gives you a chance to save. Be smart.|`|iN27E3WCaa	We got engaged July 2006 and were married July 2007.  My husband was (still is) in grad school so we knew the wedding had to be in the summer, and due to religious reasons we couldn't do it any earlier than July.|`|29I8PWrxaa	How long do you have left to go in college?  I am in my fourth year of University and got engaged in December.  When figured out approximately how many people we would be inviting and around how much the wedding would cost, we crunched the numbers to calculate how long we needed to save up.  My fiance is already working full time and we already have bought a house together a year ago, so we have figured out that we can afford a $10,000 wedding by June 2010 (a year after I graduate) as long as I find a full time job soon after I graduate in April.  <br>  <br>  It's different for everyone ... if you are wondering how long to wait for the wedding because of financial reasons, you will need to do what we did and calculate how much you need to save and how long it will take to save it.  I personally think you will probably need about a year after graduation to save up and get ready for the wedding.  Planning during school is just way too hectic!|`|rHuAhN3iaa	We're getting married in about sixteen months (my boyfriend just proposed a few days ago as well). There is a couple of reasons for this:<br>  <br>  1. We want to enjoy it.<br>  2. We need to save up the money to do it and our parents want to save up money to help us.<br>  3. I'll be finished up all of my masters classes by then.<br>  4. It's a really great amount of time, you don't have to rush, you can look into lots of venues that will meet your needs and all of the decision can be really thought through before the big day.<br>  5. There is no shame in waiting. You already know you're going to be together forever.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	Its a personal choice. I am 32 never really had a boyfriend until now, I  was only with my man for barely a year when we got engaged, and a year later we planned our wedding. We had only known eachother 2 months before becoming commited as boyfriend/girlfriend. I moved in 6 months later, his divorce from his first wife wasnt even legal yet. SO its totally up to you, whether you want a big or small wedding, what you can afford. Sure age plays a part, but its up to you!|`|mrysAOpGaa	my husband and i were together 2 years before we got engaged. I actually got married 1 month before i graduated highschool:) call me crazy if you want but were happy as can be and its been 5 years AND hes been deployed 3 out of those 5:)|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	I would wait 2 years : ) 1 year to enjoy your engagement and the next year planning the wedding : ) Congratulations!!|`|O1b7das7aa	Engaged 2/93, married 7/93. This year we are celebrating our 16th anniversary.|`|16HN5H3Maa	Most people I know waited about 3-6 months.|`|AA10128553	I have been engaged since june 2007 and am getign married Nov 2009|`|NrwJyffxaa	lol my story will blow your mind.  I met my wife for the first time in September of 99.  We got engaged November of 99.  We got married March 10th of 2000. So to save you the math.  I knew her for 2 months before getting engaged and then had a lengthy engagement of 4 months.   <br>  <br>  Now for you other part we were both college students also.  We both stayed in college after being married.  She didn't finish because she got bored.  I finished 4 years start to finish.   When I graduated we had  a total of $5,000 in student loans between the 2 of us.  One of the most important lessons in life is how to manage money and I don't know of a collage that teaches it.  <br>  <br>  Now almost 9 years later we are still very happily married.  If it is the right person it doesn't matter how long you wait.  The longer you put it off for money the more money you will spend when you think you have the money. Alot of marriages that wait end up putting the couple further in debt then if they had just gotten married to start with.|`|eEcgDfI9aa	we didnt wait that long we got engaged in november and getting married in march. we would wait longer but he wants to get married before he goes to afganistan.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	7 months.  I was done with high school, and not planning on going to college.  He already had a good job, so we didn't really have anything to worry about financially.  I think it was a good amount of time for us, but there's nothing wrong with having a longer engagement if you think you need more time.
r6oaBPhiaa	just keep in mind many guys are players, watch out girl|`|690MZg0Xaa	Hes playin u....leave him  NOW|`|9d8u0rqOaa	I think I answered your other question as well. Dont' remember which one. I'll just look at it as a new question from someone else.<br>  <br>  Ok, it's either he doesn't want you anymore or does not have access to text and emails.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	That means he doesn't really know what he wants. He is just saying what he feels is right to say.No he doesn't hate you, unless you did something to him. Other than that it could actually mean nothing.|`|eNulfbs7aa	Were you actually with him..you know physically??

5ajPMlrqaa	1. He has already taken legal action to show he no longer wants you as his wife - and he has written proof of this legal action<br>  <br>  2. He views the remaining action as "loose ends" that need to be tied up, which don't really affect his true marital status. <br>  <br>  3. He hasn't seen you in almost 2 years, which, come on, what type of marriage would that be even if he had filed no legal action? Plus he hasn't spoken to you in over a year?<br>  <br>  4. He has her, wants to be with her, and wants to prove to her that he's no longer with you.<br>  <br>  The real question is... are you still hanging on to him when he doesn't want you? And why are you reading her blog? Sweetie, it is over. Please move on.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Because in his eyes, he's divorced from you and you basically are.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	He probably sums it up that since you guys no longer live together and have not seen each other in over two years that you do not have anything going. It is much easier to say you are divorced than to explain all the details.   I do not blame him for saying that.
BLsdUBfIaa	How MUCH of an age difference?? 2? 6? 20 years?!?<br>  <br>  Besides the age difference, here's something to answer your questions..Go up to her and talk about it.<br>  <br>  YES, you might be nervous when you go up to talk to her, but didn't you talk to her before?<br>  <br>  Remember, whatever answer you are looking for to your question, you HAVE to talk to HER.<br>  <br>  Not her friends, or your friends and don't even listen to what other people say to you becuase it might not even be TRUE!! It's called gossip and most likely its not true.<br>  <br>  The only true answer you'll get is from her! <br>  <br>  Rake up the courage to walk up to her and don't be afraid. REMEMBER you've talked to her before, so its not like its the first time your talking to her.<br>  <br>  YES, it will FEEL like it's the first time your talking to her, but still take my advice and REMEMBER that its NOT!! If you keep thinking about that, it won't be so scary.<br>  <br>  For whatever reason she's NOT talking to you, only SHE knows the real truth and reason why.<br>  <br>  ANOTHER THING TO ADD<br>  <br>  Think about it this way, if you don't want to talk to her about it just yet.<br>  <br>  Both you and her have just been talking on and off. <br>  <br>  ON and OFF!! Not constantly everyday at 5pm in the afternoon!!(exaggeration)<br>  <br>  I had a similar problem like you. I've been talking with him on and off about things and a couple of weeks later we don't even talk to each other anymore. My problem was because we didn't SEE each other as often as we did before. If you don't see her as often as you did before maybe that's why.<br>  <br>  WHY SHE DOESN'T SAY HI?<br>  <br>  OK so say you see each other about the same as before, what's next?<br>  After a couple weeks things got strange and she doesn't say hi. Maybe she wants to say hi to you too but when you guys get closer to each other in "Hi how are you" distance, maybe she gets in a panic on what to do next. wave and say hi or risk waving and/or saying hi and being ignored because she might think you might not see her.<br>  <br>  If what I just said is weird and doesn't make sense to you, just go up and talk to her.<br>  <br>  What I tried to explain in the above was hard to explain in the first place. I tried to explain it my hardest!!!<br>  <br>  Anyways if you still have problems e-mail me<br>   <br>  babikrystalrose@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  (tell me who you are because i get alot of junk mail)|`|9xvyjRuBaa	Maybe she realized she likes you and is timid about it.

She may have some personal issues, or could be depressed about something. So she need space, or solitude. How would you find out what's wrong with her, if you don't approach her, and ask. Right? Her change of behavior can be a cause of a lack of interest in you, or a personal issue. Don't wait for her to come to you, come to her, and show some compassion. You know, she could be testing you too! So, the next time you see her, give her some flowers, and ask her if there's anything wrong, because you missed her.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	It could go both ways. It's either she doesn't like you and found someone else or she does like you but is to shy to admit that she does like you.<br>  <br>  I can't tell from how you explained it but to the best of my knowledge it can go both ways. Just keep digging to see what's really going on.|`|YWib1tlQaa	JUST GO FOR IT> ASK HER OUT ON A DATE. A BIG ONE. GO TO A MOVIE.

Good luck.|`|xKjecOTYaa	Just support him, be positive, and realize that with or without a job, the sun will still rise tomorrow. It's not the end of the world, you will live. My girlfriend broke up with me because I was laid-off for four months, oh well life goes on.|`|061w3vbYaa	How can you counteract feelings of hopelessness? “It is crucial that you establish your own ‘workday’ schedule so that you start your day knowing what is to be done,” suggests the book Get a Job in 30 Days or Less. The authors recommend that you “set daily goals and record what you have done.” In addition, they say that “each day must start with your getting dressed for work.” Why? “Being dressed properly will give you added confidence even when talking on the telephone.”<br>  <br>  Yes, you must make it your job to find a job, no matter how long it takes. Katharina, a girl in such situation adopted this businesslike approach. She says: “I obtained the addresses and phone numbers of prospective employers from the employment office. I responded to newspaper ads. I studied the phone book and made lists of companies that might have jobs that were not yet advertised, and then I contacted them. I also compiled a resume and sent it to these companies.” After such systematic searching, Katharina found a suitable job.<br>  <br>  Gaby, you will find it more useful if you go through the web source i have given you. Try it now and support your sweet hubby!<br>  <br>  You are in my prayers!<br>  <br>  ritchieinfo@yahoo.co.in|`|LzlnlrHKaa	I can't really tell from your post if you are a stay at home wife or not, so it's hard to say how huge of an impact the loss of a job has on your family.  My husband was also laid off this year and it was really hard for us because I have been working a huge number of hours while he struggles to find a company that want to hire more people.  My best advise would be to stay positive.  Plan ahead, review your budget, and let him know that he isn't alone.  I also have given extra compliments to let him know that I am not disappointed in him and that I understand that times are tough right now.
qc9iax2maa	go shopping with her! I mean like, with a parent or something as well. You should get something like DDR, too! That's always fun with friends! Get out! Ride bikes to a park or lake and swim! Get on AIM. You guys could talk about a lot! You could also get on some fun websites together when you guys aren't hanging out.

Nothing is more soothing than a good heart laugh. reminisce on old happy times. SIng aloud to eachother, since you've guys known eachother for so long none should be that shy. Talk about future goals and dreams. Boys,boys,boys who knows...it might be an interesting topic although it's over heated enough at times. The list goese on. Perhaps you guys can cook together. Listen to music etc.... After all what eles is there to do inside a house if you guys are that grown you should try stepping out a liittle for fresh air if it's possible

Maybe get gf a little closer maybe in the same hemisphere|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	jesus maybe she's just busy or forgetful, instead of getting mad her for forgetting to call you should just wait for her to call you, however long it takes, don't call her and yell at her for not calling you.  If she is always the one to answer when you call then she will always see it like that and will just wait for you to call.<br>  <br>  So go back out with her, and wait for her to call you|`|ixvzhoGUaa	Okay, I think that you two should give it another try ! i don't think it's really that big a deal if she forgets to call you back the next day or later, it doesn't mean she doesn't care. I do that to my friends sometimes, i'll be too busy doing homeowork or something ! if it was something that happens everyday and everytime, that's something to talk to her about, but i don't think it's a good reason to break up with someone. I would try to be together again, and talk to her about the whole calling you back thing. let her know that you don't appreciate it and to just be honest with you about whether or not she will be able to. I think you guys can work this out with more communication. good luck =) i hope i helped !|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Leave her alone, she lies to you. Honesty is a very important element in any relationship. And if she is incapable of being honest it will only cause you future pain and aggravation. Move on there is someone better suited for you. Good luck.|`|r6oaBPhiaa	just ask her: do you love me or not?|`|wy5SiCS2aa	I'm sorry but long distance relationships rarely work. It takes time to make a relationship work, and one on one time to make intimacy and closeness grow. I would move on, sorry. Never get back with an ex unless something has changed in the circumstances because all your old problems will still be there and just cause more heartache.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Well, you don't love her, you just think you love her because you are confused and you have no understanding of emotions.  You think that if someone makes you feel good then that is love, it's not.<br>  <br>  So leave it - never talk to her again.  She's given you too many problems already.  It's over.|`|IkrnvC2Naa	ahw thats really cute, you both obviously like each other. you should really consider getting back together. but you need trust that is what is more important in a relationship. so you need to confront her and tell her that trust is the most important. its the only way long distance will work. good luck :)|`|we2Csi51aa	long distance relationships arent real. talking on the phone, emialing and only getting together every once in a while is a child like relationship. date somebody who you can actually meet up with on a daily to weekly basis.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	I don't see why not. Sounds like you two don't have any real problems. The fact that you are long distance plays a role. I understand how you feel about her not keeping her word. That can become aggrivating. Just let her know how you feel and go from there. Best of luck|`|H3h4j4aKaa	Well maybe you should have talk to her about why you where upset instead of rushing to a break up ... idk .. maybe you guys should wait til you mature a little to have a girlfriend maybe just date casually|`|VSXUa9lraa	Stay single and see if your feelings change, express the problem you have with her to her and then maybe or maybe not you'll go back out.|`|II4Po8CZaa	tell her that you will call her and then do it if you guys love eachother then you should really go ou no matter what|`|F3KkB4GWaa	If the whole problem was that your relationship was long distance i guess you could (since long distance doesnt work 99% of the time). Or you might want to try something new it sounds like youve been caught up in this one girl for a loooong time.|`|dVfanJkcaa	long distance relationships are hard and you both need to understand that, you have to understand that she may not be lying to you she may just be super busy you never really know if you love her its gonna be hard for you to just walk away from the whole thing, i say you should call her up and give her a chance and talk about how both of you feel if you love her as much as you say you do you will give her a chance but then again if her explanation is not logical you should love her enough to know that it is the time to let her go|`|TemZzSuCaa	You need to be open with her about your feelings and how her avoiding your calls makes you mad. She's just scared that someone else is going to break her heart and you can't blame her for that. She's keeping a wall up so she won't get hurt again and from a girls point of view thats ok. Be her friend first and then take things slowly. Give her time to adjust being with someone new. Of course she loves you and you love her but there's alot more to a relationship than just being in love. Just talk to her.|`|uC3pJD4Laa	I think both of you are morons for breaking up for stupid reasons. If you guys truly love eachother, Think of a good reason to break up and then get back together. After you are together again break up cuz of the better reason and THEN COME WHINING BACK TO YAHOO ANSWERS AND POST A NEW QUESTION SAYING YOU STILL LOVE HER. You guys should stay together, but because of the fact that both of you broke up it makes me hesitant that you really love eachother. Either way she had no assurance that u were going to break her heart which shows a lack of trust in you. and you breaking up with her becuase she didnt call shows you are just weired|`|AA10410277	at point you should get back with her and try to solve your problems with her. maybe she didn't call you because she was too busy or forgot try to hit her up on myspace or facebook (like whatever site you met her from). don't make a big deal out of it unless she's cheating or something. yea... you still got feelings for her, why won't you just give it another try maybe she may change.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	you need to look closely at the first break up. History always will repeat itself.  On this first break did she at any time see any one else..if so drop her..it is too lame an excuse to say we need to break because I am afraid of getting hurt.. Its like saying, I love my cat so I got to give it up ..this doesnt jive..she is afraid you will move on but she continues to do what she likes..you got problems..ditch her..<br>  sorry to break it to you ....|`|QnaLbLk4aa	Obviously its not working out long distance. im sorry but trying to go back with her would be a waste of both of yall's time. if i were you i would try to get over her and just be friends or cut her completely and try 2 find someone new.good luck|`|jMUOfAU6aa	dont throw it away, long distant relationships are so hard but you can prove everyone wrong and do this, trust me when i tell you this, it'll all be worth it in the end|`|oQwnbblyaa	if you still love her, and she still loved you. get back together with her. try to work out your differences because tomorrow is'nt promised to us and you don't want to have any regrets.|`|MTIjS6Paaa	there's a reason why you have broken up before. So my question for you is what makes you think it will work this time? if your willing to make it work, you'll both have to change.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	say ur srry! no offense, but breaking up w/ her because of a few missed phone calls? like, really? if u LOVE her u'd deal w/ that. maybe it wont wrk out, cuz u cant handle that.|`|0BJLJQ9raa	well this may seem weird but u should call her txt her u dont say how far u are appart but i dont think shes lyin or cheating on u    u may want to talk to her soon!|`|QRG1Szn6aa	Win her back and tolk sweet to her i am a girl and trusted me this works:)|`|7z7SwFuraa	It's only been a week so it's natural for you to want to go back.  Most people consider getting back with their ex's after a break up and it takes awhile for those feelings to lessen and eventually go away.  <br>  <br>  You broke up with her for a legitimate reason and the question now is, is this something she can change/fix or can you deal with her not calling back when she says she will?  If you think the situation can improve or that you can learn to deal with it, then maybe you should consider going back to her.  If not, then just give it some time, and eventually you'll move on.  <br>  <br>  Also, how old are you and how long have you been going out?  That could also have an impact on my answer...|`|9d8u0rqOaa	Long distance relationship never works. Ok maybe 3%. But that's just plain old boring if you're with someone emotionally but not physically. It's a lot better to be with someone who's actually next to you than a phone call away.<br>  <br>  You never know what she's doing too so that's one of the cons of a long distance relationship.<br>  <br>  I'll use my friend as an example. He's been with this chick for 5 years (long distance). The whole time the chick was engaged to someone else and next thing you know it, she calls my friend telling him that she's getting married. Now how F'd up is that?<br>  <br>  So seriously bro, do yourself a favor and start dating someone locally.
iUzSlmSbaa	Communication is the key to it all.. you both need to make time to talk to each other.. that is a very important part in a relationship.. tell him  your feelings.. in any relationship one should always be able to talk to ones partner if something is bothering you.. or if you are worried .. one should be able to share concerns, problems, joy, dreams, hopes.. all that.. and for that it's important for you to take your partner aside when he is not busy and not stressed doing something important.. and say.. ''I have something on my mind and I would like us two to talk about this'' then tell him exactly how you feel.. he should listen.. and then respond...then you know where you both stand in your relationship..That is the main problem I see in your relationship.. that you stopped to really communicate.. try to find out why this has happened.. by talking to him..  and by telling him about your feelings.. he is supposed to be your partner.. or even your soulmate.. so you should definitely be able to broach a subject that concerns your relationship toward each other...Do that and you will feel more at ease.. you will know where you stand.. that is important.|`|jrHVRqvBaa	Not to scare you but if you don't mind the honest truth, my husband stopped having sex with me for a while because he was having an affair. Check for evidence or hire an investigator if you think so|`|jNQbVDHSaa	leave sooner rather than later.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Men never turn sex down.  He is up to something.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	Sex can be there even at the age of eighty and if your life partner is losing this power, it means you are failing in making love with him or her and if your prepare yourself, things shall change.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	He is seeing some one else!!|`|vh0yVJ7daa	Could be anything,Maybe your ugly and he can't stand the site of you anymore,Maybe your annoying?Maybe he is having an affair and just doesn't know how to tell you he don't love you anymore,I don't know what to suggest,Maybe wait for him to come home and answer the door in some sexy lingerie and say F me now,If that dont work then pm me because I know how to please a woman ;)|`|N41ofUWpaa	First let me say I am sorry for the rude answers you have received so far this morning. Now for your question.  There is lots of reasons why he may not want sex. They do not all mean he is having an affair or doesn't love you anymore.  Before jumping to any conclusion please ask him about his health, his job, his friends ect. He may have physical or emotional issues he is uncomfortable to bring to you attention.  Open the door but do not push. After you have done all you can to get him to open up to you-then make your decision about what is best for you. Just remember time is the one thing in life that can not be replaced. Don't waste it being unhappy.  I hope your day gets much better.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	He has got hooked to someone else but still not sure for some reasons ?|`|W0KQTXrvaa	what ever you do don't say i do you will be doomed
W0KQTXrvaa	omg what happened?|`|oeEsnwSMaa	what????|`|sVdQSMvJaa	If you don't want them judging you don't put your business in the street to be judged.    Regardless if you "chased" the married man, you are having an affair with one...who chased whom is not the issue.    What his wife did or did not do to her schedule and why she did it is really none of your business.    Did you hear her say those things to him or is that what he told you?  And again what goes on inside their marriage is really none of your business.      It doesn't matter how much pleading he did, he is MARRIED, and not to you.  By being in the picture you're doing nothing more than complicate an already very complicated situation.    You ended up together by developing an inappropriate emotional bond, that's called an emotional affair.      Yes it does take more than a signed piece of paper to make a marriage work.  It takes commitment, honesty, trust, communication...with your WIFE not your mistress.    God is the only right judge and He will judge to each of us what we measure out to others.  Mayb you ought to consider this when you walk around justifying your affair and defaming your lover's wife.    Sad thing is you need to hear the truth but since you named other members in your title you'll probably have this deleted for violation of TOS.

4drQ38qZaa	I don't think is really a breakup until you two really tell each other you don't want to see each other again. By the way the only reason her parent freaked is probably because she and you and 3 years apart.|`|rIahFCCMaa	If ya first Gf dumped ya(hahahahahahahahaha) then turn into a poof (hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha...|`|zE45KFovaa	Hey ronald ,    I think you will be able to get great answers to your question on http://www.GuysTeachGirls. com very helpful site.. solved allot of problems for me..lol Enjoy..

pIKPFpbiaa	I guess morals are not an option?|`|hoBREUGLaa	It means he doesn't want you just to have sex with you anymore. He wants to actually try to have a relationship with you. There are people who can just have benefits and others who start to feel like they want to be more than just a sex toy.|`|19TSkwaKaa	He wasnt in the mood??    He thinks hes using you?    Maybe he wants more than a FWB?|`|AA11571111	if you are not hungry, how would you like the food, you will not lke it. Is't it ? similarly you have to wait between the two meals.|`|59HXAtRHaa	Bye bye FWB and hello girlfriend!!    Hes ova the whole sex thing, theres no such thing as FWB b/c something like this always seems to happen...

Do u wanna start a realtionship wif him???    Talk it out with him and save him the heart brake|`|gxlEqdclaa	Like any new relationship the sexual passion dies down after a few months. Usually a FWB relationship would die down and then completely stop but in your case it looks like he is now thinking of you as a girlfriend.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	he is bored with sexor getting it elsewhere. why do you need a fwb whe you are seeing other people.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	It just means you have gone thru the passionate stage.  That part doesn't last very long.  The relationship is moving to a new level.    OR he is getting it from someone else now.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	He might be getting attached but I know you where already thinking that. Cause guys in the fwb relationship is not the usual suspect for getting attached.  So if you don't want him you might have to stop what you  and him have been doing.|`|RoEyFm5yaa	MAYBE HE IS NOT SO SURE ON THE FWB THING ANYMORE.HE MAY HAVE DEVELOPED FEELINGS FOR YOU.|`|rjYOC3Wpaa	COME BE MY FWB
VTGrUZbOaa	yes! Forgiving is the key for a successful relationship! :)
t2R3mEMoaa	You obviously had your reasons for kicking him out, don't forget that. You refer to him as a boy. Maybe it's time to do some maturing on your part. Leave well enough alone and move on.
UjEAn0bWaa	Screw him|`|cr2KKT6Naa	get some protection and say no strings get your rocks off.|`|qXkywBogaa	we definetly gono read this.....  make it brief..... maybe u phuck her
55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Good luck .. the time for that has passed... Ya see if you were special to that person, and the things you said and did made you a person they wanted to "be around or hang with" then they will miss those good times and experiences. If you did make the good impression then .. it's too late to become missed now.    Sorry ... just be happy being you, do what you feel, and when you feel it needs to be done... the folks who will be drawn to you will value you for who you are, and not what you pretend to be.    Good Luck|`|700GE22raa	Avoid talking to him/her. But smile at him when you see him. Don't show much interest in asking/telling anything to him.  This all helps some time.   I try these out sometime!|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	You can't. If that person wants to miss you...then they will. What lasting impression have you left with that person; that they'll want to miss...and be truthful.|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	you just have to keep yourself buys around them spend time with them but then always have something else to do
PCa8jwMuaa	You could do a number of things. Some ideas include:    1) If he owns a car, you can flaten his tyres (ha!)  2) Tell everybody he knows that he has herpes and if you want, you could also tell them that he gave it to you.  3) Write to his current girlfriend a heart felt letter saying what a horrible monster he was to you - you don't have to include your name and if he confronts you, just deny everything!  4) Watch 'Gossip Girl' to get some juicy vindictive idea's.  5) You probably need to see a counsellor in the process to help you heal the past sufferings that your ex put you through.    Good luck and all the best. Don't get mad, get even!|`|hoBREUGLaa	You don't sound like a typical homicidal woman.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	?? chemo for a miscarriage|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	You are clearly NOT over it. If you were, you wouldn't be thinking of ways to get back at him. Focus your energy on what you have now. If I was your partner; I'd be wandering why you're still so bothered about the ex. Revenge is over-rated. All it proves; is how much you DO STILL CARE.
19TSkwaKaa	Dont talk to any other girls or flirt with them. Even if you think she wont find out.    Talk to her all the time. Tel her how youre feeling|`|hoBREUGLaa	If she can't accept the fact that your seriously telling the truth, then she's better off alone to be honest. My current girlfriend and I had trust issues when our relationship started and we came to the agreement that even if I feel that she's trying to hide something, if she doesn't say it or I think she's lying I need to let it go and take her word, and I have since. There are some things that we talk about that I know she isn't being completely clear about or doesn't explain completely, but that's the whole point of a relationship isn't it? Trust.|`|nQix64Puaa	well dude if she truely trust you then why those bullshit wud make her doubt about u? she sounds a lil vulnerable no offensive tho. and if u've tried your best then what u can do is probably wait till time get things straight, or if it's too long then i say move on.
NC8Vb36Daa	It happens in every relationship, but you have rough patches, honestly if you both stick at it and try hard you can make it work and that spark will come back, maybe go away together and see if it rekindles something!? If it feels like an effort to have sex, then so what, make that effort, in the end you'll both feel good through it. Honestly there has been many times in my relationship I've thought about ending it because that initial spark has gone, but you've got to admit that won't last forever, it never does with anyone its a shame but that's life, people can actually get addicted to that feeling, and therefore go around get a boyfriend/girlfriend every other month. But that's a different story, A relationship goes through stages and once that whole "I could die for you" and "lets kiss every second of everyday" and the guy is buying you flowers every week writing how much he loves you etc. etc. is gone, It brings on a new stage, and although it doesn't seem exciting at first compared to the first stage (i.e. The spark) it does get better, the next thing is to go on holiday with each other and then after that its the next step and so on. If your sure he's the one then it will work out, and lets be honest who is actually themselves at the first bit of a relationship, now he probably feels comfortable and doesn't feel the need to please as much!? Hope this helps :-)
g0YNQdL2aa	Just get rid of him unless you want to be a doormat for the rest of your life.|`|8t0DlWf8aa	i think you are a cool person.so go and tell him to choose and that if he tell you that he likes the other girl you will not have problem.you will just leave him.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Is my life over. pahhh  Its only just beginning. Dump the looser and find someone who knows how to treat you. Live your life :)|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Why would your life be over? Your relationship should be. He's been cheating for six months. It doesn't matter whether he chooses you or not. He's been cheating on you. Kick him to the curb.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	GO BACK TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY and GET AWAY from this womanizer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you think for one minute that this is the first time he's done anything like this behind your back>>>YOUR WRONG!!!!!!!!   He's a womanizer. You need to go back HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cr2KKT6Naa	buy him a new phone. and throw his other out. dont program her   in the new one.|`|htWw0OlCaa	That's heartbreaking.... Sorry about all this. Well, I know you still love him, 5 years is a long time to be with someone and then they stomp on your heart like he did. Since you are in another country with him, do to him what he did to you, save money to get back to your family. In the meantime, just hang in there and try to find someone that will take your heartache away, and either go and be with him, or go back to your family. I hope this has helped. Best wishes|`|AA11567932	He is cheating on you and the fact that you found out is the only reason why he cannot deny it. I would leave him, he says he wants you but you dont keep contact with another whom you have been seeing secretly (until now) for the last 6 months of your relationship.    If you continue to see him even though you say you no longer trust him then you are allowing this to happen and you deserve more respect than that.    Easier said than done when you love someone but he obviously doesn't love you anymore otherwise he wouldnt have cheated.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	dont be his lubricant|`|b31b1b51b29ef1215ca5dd0f928b6e53aa	You have 3 choices here,    1. Pick your self up, kick is butt to the curb, and make a life for yourself in whatever country you are in.    2. Pick yourself up, kick his butt to the curb, and go home and start again.    3. Stay with a cheating creep and set yourself up for a lot more heartache.|`|8qpUbbHHaa	Your life is not over. I know you devoted five years to this relationship. But if you want to do something about it try "putting the shoe on the other foot". In other words do to him what he's doing to you. Let him see how you feel.
UB5XVt7uaa	Miki, I know your pain! When I was in high school I was in the popular group too but when that happens again, run up to the girls first. Maybe your friend will start to see how you feel and inquire about it eventually. Then you wont feel so awkward about it when you share your feelings.|`|szGNAjGcaa	well for one   don't call the other 2 gurls "the leaders"|`|wxnfDptaaa	first things first u need to sort ur group out. there shudnt be any leaderss, so id sort that out, i know u cant go up to them and say there shud be no leaders cos u wud probably get kicked ot of the "group" but u make the decision if u want to be frieds with themmm.    everyone shud be treated equally so get her on your own and tell her how u feel, but if u know shes gonna run and tell the two leaders then maybe u shudnt tell her if u still ant to have friends.
2o3BHgCCaa	How far in advance. Usually they do not predict more than a week in advance and they change this as each day goes by. They do have long term predictions, but these are less accurate.    Start from here and keep checking your local weather:  http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/watl/rainfall/...
AA11591992	You answered your own question.  You show that you can be a good father to her son, if you are truly ready for that then everything else should be easy.  Show her you are a mature guy and the rest will come naturally.  If however it does not workout between you and her you need to treat her son as if nothing has changed, please be careful with the child.|`|AA12059817	It's hard for me to love a woman who isn't 15 years older than me!...It's not uncommon, you just have to convince her that you can assume the role of a much older man (that your going to be there for her and her son).|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	There are 2 kinds of males. Males who want cougars and males who ARE cougars.    Its better to  be than to want.     but you are both adults. You can do what you want to do.  You asked this question the other day which means you still havent done anything about your feelings.  By now You should have asked HER the question. Most of the answers you got before from other people was "go for it".     Would she be into you? I dont know. Older women like us guys in our 20's but you arent even 20 yet. Ive heard more women refer to 19 as "yuck" than "yah!!".  Most women I know are not into 19 year old guys or 18 year old guys. Even demi stopped at 25ish.|`|kANR98tIaa	nothing,     "age is not a barrier to anything"
w0ZqjJBtaa	I think you already know that answer to your question. Your relationship will almost certainly turn nasty if you stay with him. How dare he dictate who contacts you? Controlling men/women; feed off their partners having nobody else in their lives but them. This is how their control is sustained. You need to leave him before he strips you of all self-esteem and confidence. He has already threatened you...what more do you need?

aYnJG2iiaa	I do believe that you can't help who you fall in love with, but I also believe that you CAN be smart about relationships, and you CAN realize when a relationship is inappropriate or physically or emotionally abusive.|`|uDkXHaa6aa	I do belive the saying "you can't help who you fall in love with" sometimes I think you are just attracted to the person mentally, physically and spiritually and controlling your heart is a hard thing to do.|`|KCsMzrobaa	I believe that I couldn't help it.  I can't speak for others. I know I would have made a better choice. I love him and he's mine but I will kill him if he cheats.|`|v3FONOlPaa	to a point i believe it..|`|d6RQN2QWaa	I think if you feel yourself falling for someone who you know is not a good person or not the best person for you, etc and you allow it to happen, then it's your fault.  If you feel it starting, you are a big girl/boy and can distance yourself before you get too involved.  It's always easier to break it off earlier rather than later.|`|3KSJslMMaa	Yes, I believe you can't help who you fall in love with. The most inappropriate person out there could be the one you are meant to be with. No one can help it. Love is a great thing, yet it can really hurt you.|`|9mBu7XASaa	i believe, what ever doesnt kill you, simply makes you, stranger. haha anyway, i believe you cant help who you fall for. the heart knows what it wants. you dont choose who you love, it just happens|`|kG9hGPm3aa	There's a difference between love, lust, and a crush.

If you don't want to hurt them the best thing to say is that you don't like them.  Because if you lead them on in the long run, it'll hurt them worse.

xRimEBNgaa	Interesting question. It sounds as though you may not always feel like this, but particularly around one person you do? Usually when I idealize someone, they just happen to be attractive. I mean I tell myself there's all kinds of other reasons I'm really wanting to be with them, but that always just happen to be attractive. <br>  <br>  What kind of future is in a relationship in which you're insecure? In my relationships where I've found someone beautiful who likes being around me, I don't even care about me. I'll read the books they want to read, I'll see movies they want to see, which is all interesting and informative (or dull as hell later), but as I have become progressively consumed with these women, I lose sight of what I want to do. I lose sight of what I value because all I see is her. And it seems like love, but when it wanes, I start to remember me, but I've neglected me for a while, so it seems like nothing's there inside me worth anything, and I keep going back to what feels right but becomes impossible, because the more I feel worthless the more I think they will leave me, and the more worthless I feel the less I can let that happen. Clingy, you know?<br>  <br>  I've learned this is something akin to addiction. Symmetrical faces have what's called a variable reinforcing value. That means that because most faces aren't beautiful, when I see one that is, it comes as a surprise, and it catches my attention, so I feel more focused. But the more my attention would be drawn away by a beautiful face, the less would be left for my friends, family, and career, until they become dispensible. It's only because I was graced by patient, selfless friends that I kept those friendships. <br>  <br>  But hey, maybe this is not at all what you're talking about.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Heather, <br>  <br>  It sounds like you want something and you are projecting rejection before you even know how this guy feels (did I explain that right?).  What is going on with your thoughts--sounds like it's "I'm unworthy to be around this person because he is so wonderful."  Cognitive behavioral therapy would say that is the incorrect thought--you have something to offer and you are discounting it at that moment.  You are assuming that he is this wonderful person who is discounting you as well--are you reading his mind?  Approach him as "this is an interesting person.  Maybe we have something in common.  I'm going to get to know him as a person first and see if anything might develop, but I'm not going to count on it."  Give it a try.|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	Insecurity is a tough one to beat. It comes from the very heart of your being. I can only tell you from experience that I was my own worst critic and was seldom perceived as half as geeky as I imagined myself. Just rely on what you're good at and confident about yourself and try and  project those great traits. Do not try and be something or someone you are not. Remember, even the focus of your attention is just a person with as many faults and insecurities as you. And just as lovable

It's understandable that he wants to do fun stuff, but so do you, so do your kids.  How about taking the whole family out for weekend fun instead of just himself?  If nothing else, hire help.

Explain to them that this is a household and there are no "chores", only responsibilities that need to be done to keep the house in order.  In order for the home to function properly everyone needs to pitch in and help.  This is good for your children because they will not only grow up to be good housekeepers themselves, but doing things together as a family builds trust and respect. If you don't tell them, especially your husband, that you need help, they will never know.  I was in the same situation with my husband.  He would always ask "is there anything I can do?" and instead of saying "what's dirty needs to be cleaned" I would say no.  It got to the point where he stopped asking and I started complaining.  I explained to him that the way I was raised, if something was on the floor you picked it up no matter whose it was or who left it there.  Your family is a team, and if one member is pulling the other members weight, it is all going to come crashing down on them.  Good luck and be patient, it may take time.
48W167cBaa	A few sentences on one side would be nice- a "welcome home!", an "I missed you!", and a "I hope you had fun!/I hope you enjoyed yourself!" would be sweet of you.<br>  <br>  Pictures of the two of you together would be okay, but it depends. Was she on the trip with friends? If so, pictures might be a little weird. If it was a family trip, I'd definitely include some pictures.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it! :)

EZKe92TTaa	I think both his faces are real. Don't you see? He's too inhibited, as many people are, to talk about real feelings to the person he cares most about. It doesn't come naturally to him.  Some people feel very vulnerable when they do this. The alchohol freed up his inhibitions so he said what he actually felt inside. He didn't mean to insult you by getting drunk again, I think he liked feeling loose enough to be vocally free with his feelings.Explain to him how important it is for you to hear him speak his feelings about you when sober. Do it lovingly, without anger. Tell him that it's hard to just hear criticism when he's sober. Tell him that it was wonderful to hear some softer kinder words when he was drunk and you're sure he  can do it when sober too. Those words were his too, just buried inside.  Don't be angry, though I can understand why you feel so frustrated. I think you both can try a little exercise speaking kindly to each other and telling one another one or two nice things about the other each and every day, so he can get used to voicing those kind and loving thoughts he has about you. Even if it seems artificial at first. View is as an exercise in maintaining a healthy marriage. With a little help, practice and time, you may find him complimenting you spontaneously without the exercise.   But talk to him about it and show him by example how you would like to be spoken to and treated.|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Sam, your husband is the kind of man who can't tell you the truth sober because he is too afraid to tell you about his insecurities.

If you are married, this can't possibly be the first time he has ever gotten drunk!?  Because that would be strange.  How old are you?  Because you sound quite young, maybe you both are.  If I were you, I wouldn't take anything too personally- it seems like he has some issues.  It sounds like he is just grumpy when he is sober and not much fun.  Which is too bad.  Have you talked to him about what happened?  I hope I didn't offend you- that is not my intention, just want to offer up my opinion.|`|9c8ea4cf035f809b42cd1b21b58e7533aa	They are both him.

And drinking adds the courage's to talk to them... See I believe that alcohol will make a guy (some) feel more sexy and horny...

Good Luck!|`|OntO6wE4aa	He is both. He might feel embarrassed about saying sweet things when he's sober. Alcohol is his tiger juice. Anger is the frustration of not being able to be sweet while sober. You have to get him to practice the sweet talk to get past the uneasy feeling he might be having. Tell him to just say what he wants to say as long as it's pleasing to your ear. Judgment and critical talk isn't allowed. Sweetness is in there you just have to get him to feel comfortable with the side you like. Sober he might feel that he's not giving you what you want. That's why he threatens about you leaving. Work with him and he'll realize that your right. good luck|`|MxHRjPFHaa	It is very hard for some men to say things like that to the other sex,its just hard trust me...And when you do get a little booze inside the body things come out you would not belive,and thats just what is his doing to you...I really belive he is in love with you very much....So there's nothing wrong with it at all.............All I can say is get him drunk more ofter sounds like a happy drunk|`|wkNvFMLGaa	People often tell what they think when drunk, because their confidence rises and they feel more chatty. I guess your husband has some serious insecurities which get lost or ''hide'' when he is drunk and without worries. This is teh better case, imagine he would NEVER tell you all this. Also another reason why is that he doesn't want to compliment you because he is worried you would get too big headed as my boyfriend sometimes says...the otehr day he told me all these sweet things and i was like awrrr why can't you tell me this more often...well his answer was what i said : because if i tell you all the time you would get big headed ....men huh..lol|`|K1oOQqqVaa	You have a weird way of looking at things.

So he needs this alcoholic Dutch Courage to give him the nerve!    He sounds a genuine enough good guy to me/and you sound to have a good marriage ...so look on this as a minor character flaw and hang on to him.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I've always thought that the "real" person comes out when they are drunk.  But honestly it sounds like the opposite to me.  This is going to sound like Sociology 101 but...did he grow up in an abusive (verbally) or judgmental family?  My feeling is he has this great ability to love and be sweet but for some reason he feels like he needs to stuff those feelings because he's afraid to feel vulnerable.      I hope you two have talked about his behavior and that it's hurtful to you for him to be critical of you.  He needs to work on bringing the wall down and start being complimentary all the time.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	Both sides are him, You know how he feels so leave it at that.  Asking him why he needs to get drunk in order to say those words you love to hear only puts him in a hole where he won't want to be.  You don't think he wonders that himself.  As for the part: he could never stand to see me with another guy. He said he'd have to kill him - or me - or both.  To a degree he may just mean it. I don't think in the sense you 2 are no longer together and life has went on, but In the sense he comes home from work one day and finds you spread eagle with some guy going to town on you.   In that sense, most real men are going to see red.  I know myself and I sure wouldn't be saying, Oh, I'm sorry, did I interrupt.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Some people are more tense and uptight when sober. Alcohol has a relaxing effect with them. I have noticed that some students at the university I attend will drink a margarita before class if they have a presentation to give that day. They don't need to be drunk to say the things they intend to say. The alcohol just helps to relax them, so they can focus more on what they have to say and less about how nervous they are to be speaking in front of a group of people. Perhaps something similar is going on with your husband. Maybe he feels like what he has to say might come out wrong just because he's a little nervous. A few drinks can help to take the edge off, so he can speak freely.    This Jekyll and Hyde thing is a little more severe though. I have a friend who has a serious rage problem. He was always afraid to drink because he thought he might be an angry drunk. Turns out whenever he drank too much, he would just sit around smiling. But when sober, he always managed to get into a fight. That's just how it is with some people. You will probably get your best explanation from a doctor.|`|AA11603810	He may not be comfortable talking like that on a normal basis, but the alcohol is liquid courage to him. Either way, it's not very healthy and you need to talk.|`|IF95rI2aaa	Sometime it is hard for men to say things like that, I think he loves you and thinks your beautiful all the time, he may just have a hard time saying it.

zhaHc4FAaa	Hon... I first want to say kuddos to you for standing up and not using this as an excuse to leave your man as you see the good parts about him that are wonderful.       The only advice that I could give to you is to share those exciting moments with friends and family.  In other words if you absolutely know that he will not give you the support you desire don't try to receive it from someone who is clearly not capable of giving it to you.   Search for the positive reinforcement from your close friends or family.  Tell them about your career goals...tell them about your new face cream...women are more interested in things like this anyway and are better at encouraging than some men are.       As Dr.  Phil said - Sometimes one is not capable of what we truly desire.   In other words,  if you went to your husband and told him to give you the keys to your car and he tells you that he doesn't have them ....does wishing that he had the keys to your car change the fact that he doesn't?   He doesn't have the keys plain and simple.  So,  we look for the keys somewhere else....that is what you will have to do in this case.   Your husband is judgemental and critical and does not possess the keys to be encouraging and supportive....This is how he is.   Look for the love and support that you need through friends, activities, social networking, and family.      Good Luck|`|zFbhYl1Baa	i have a similar marriage. if i didn't have a child i think i'd leave, it only gets worse and i'm reminded of it every minute he's home. he'll tell me he's trying, but in reality he's not and being very cruel in the process.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	Think about you and what makes you happy.  If he starts to criticize and make comments that you know are going to bring you down, walk away from him, even into another room.  This also lets him know that you are not going to tolerate his actions.    Also, find some time to talk to him and find out what is making him so negative.  Then try to bring up his mood, too.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	Well my husband and I go back and forth with the optimist/pessimist role. With certain issues I'm the optimist and he's the pessimist... or he's the optimist and I'm the pessimist.  Over the years we've learned to put each other in check. I'll out and out tell him to "stop being so negative".....   I guess if you're ALWAYS positive about things it may annoy him.. and if he's ALWYAS negative... that would irritate me to no end also.     Another thing... I don't know if the face cream is a real scenario... but seriously... I doubt if he cares about your face cream. I don't blame you for his negativity... but I've learned over the years that there are some things they just don't care about just as there are interests of theirs you don't care about.     If he "won't change".... then I don't know what to tell you.. there has got to be a compromise for at least some of the useless negativity.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	First you go see a marriage counselor and see if a third party can help you work  out this problem. Objective people can pinpoint things the two of you may not even be aware of....you could be part of the problem by constantly needing assurance. You should also be looking for other ways, not cheating, that gives you the recognition you want...volunteering is one good way.|`|9e4f17e04f6a518df825311a06f819d2aa	Leave him. Here's why:    1) He enjoys doing it, because that's what emotional abusers do.  2) He won't stop doing it - ever.  3) You'll be in a straight jacket if you stay.      Read up on emotional abuse, mental abuse, personality disorders, bipolarity, and co-dependency.      He chose you because he knew he'd get away with it, and enjoy watching you spiral into madness.  Don't let him.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	How to protect yourself from this is to FOCUS on you and what makes you happy instead of focusing on his negativity. That's how you deal with this. I understand what your saying and I have found not to focus on him so much and to just focus on me. You need to ignore his thoughts on some things and focus on what makes you happy. Theres NO REASON why you can't enjoy life jsut because someone else doesn't. Just go on with your busness of FOCUSING ON YOU!!!!! Everytime he starts to get down on something, then stop and focus on how YOU feel about the matter instead of thinking he's not going to care.|`|7ko9czaaaa	you have to ask yourself is it more good then bad, noone should have to live like that, if you have kids will he make them feel bad about there self things like that stays with a kid all there lifes.you say you love him ask yourself how can he love you and do that,|`|yy45iAbtaa	the only reason he puts you down is to make himself feel better.don't you know that it is his own insecurities that make him put you down so just think of that when he is putting you down think he is insecure that is why he is putting me down.you need to think what a wonderful person you really are and tell him to stop putting you down or you will find someone who won't how could you stay with a man who degrades you like that.at least you admit you are insecure why don't you make an appointment to go see a therapist on your own for some help even if he is not getting help you are.|`|IcH5gMICaa	You learn how to have a comeback or smart-alec answer for every quip he has.  Treat him as stupid as he treats you and see how he likes it.  Trust me, maybe my bf sees this as the opposite, but when you live with someone who is a constant dreamer but someone who never does anything -it can drive you NUTS.  Do you get these great ideas, but then never follow through?  Do you put false hopes in things that don't tend to work out?  That could bring down HIS confidence in YOU, SO if you are like this is anyway, I sympathize with your hubby.  I do sympathize with you that he should not break down your self-esteem, but you need to TELL him that this is what he's doing and also learn to stand up for yourself.  If you don't stand up for yourself, people are going to run all over you including him.|`|MvAyYyv3aa	Your need to know when to become numb to the criticism and ignore it. You know the truth so be confident in that fact,and be true to yourself.|`|AA11089526	OH JUST LEAVE!  DON'T WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE!    That is the only option I can figure but then again I have way to much self respect to be with anyone for that matter to allow them to treat me like that.  Whether it be my husband or a friend.  That is aweful.  It has nothing to do with Love.....it has everything to do with you as a person and do you respect yourself.      You said it yourself:  We aren't a good fit personality-wise.    If you already are aware of this....then deal with it.....if there are no kids in the pic yet....GET OUT!!! there are tons of men out there waiting on you to pick them and they will treat you like a million dollars.
yt2zVOZfaa	Whenever you feel ready and comfortable.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	If you have to ask then it's way to soon to take such a risk it would be better to wait until you are sure the relationship is going some where first. If it is just for sex then why do it with any one at all ? there is pleasure to be hard but the cost can be very high if you are not ready<br>  to pay the price that it could cost you. What would you feel like if you broke up the day after an he told all his pals you never really know so take extra care please.<br>  It is your body so only do it when you feel ready not because he has ragging hormones. I wish you well an hope you make the right choice.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	I'm probably older than you (I'm 26) but I think that it all depends.  If you are under 18, then you wait until you are legally old enough to have sex.  If you are over 18, then I don't think there's a set number of dates, weeks or months.  <br>  <br>  It's when you are comfortable with the person, and trust them enough to have sex with them.    With my current boyfriend, it was about 6 weeks.  I trusted him, was completely comfortable around him, and knew that he wasn't going to go away because I "gave it up".|`|n8nhjmfraa	whenever you feel ready<br>  it doesn't matter if your younger than 16 or not so don't listen to that b**** who left that answer<br>  just use protection or suffer the consequences that comes with sex|`|lVaC4Ga4aa	when eva you too are comfortable with each other.

I also think that young women love getting married, but don't necessarily like 'being' married with all of the mundane chores and un-romantic day to day responsibilities that come with it.<br>  <br>  I also think that young men don't typically know what they want until they are well into their thirties or more and it's so easy to stray. We also have a 'throw away society' it seems making people almost 'disposable'.<br>  <br>  Until they come to terms with personal challenges (ie personal freedom) and have a clear definition of goals, we are stuck watching an escalating divorce rate, not to mention lots of heartache, and mixed, extended families.<br>  <br>  But we have this thing called 'a right to freedom of choice' and as a former soldier, (although I might disagree with their choices) I do agree that they have these rights to choose.<br>  <br>  Probably the best we can hope for is to provide support and encourage mature, well informed choices.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I have and my husband and i have been happily married 18 yrs and we will be together forever.|`|Scupj6XVaa	only the ones who give their relationships time to grow. im 22 i def want to get married someday.  i just want to be sure that it's right|`|51dff71b1a9e764ae4aa42218cfb19d3aa	Not that I am aware of - serial monogamy is the modern way|`|O1b7das7aa	We're still married!

Marrying because of an "accidental pregnancy", because he/she is hot and good in bed, for money, social advancement, to get out of the house, to piss your parents off, etc...these marriages are doomed to fail.<br>  <br>  I think most young adults are jaded and some just don't see marriage as necessary.|`|aXYiOskmaa	people in your family should mind their own business. yes, folks do stay married these days and yes young people do want to get married. many times though, they like the idea of the big wedding and playing house but they don't realize that you have to work to make a happy marriage and to make it last. that's part of the reason so many marriages end in divorce.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Well the divorce rate is 50 percent.

RwXEMy0maa	In theory, anyone can come into a wedding, so even if you had planned for 40 guests, you may end up with 50! If I was you, I would maybe not halve it, but instead of 40 get 25 or 30. Then they can go between couples and a bit further just in case.     It isn't tacky. Everyone knows how much weddings cost, and most people will just throw out the program when they get home. Make sure you get one for you and hubby and then have enough for everyone to be able to see one throughout the wedding ceremony :)|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's not tacky.  I would go with the $450 price and when they're gone, they're gone :)  I've heard many former brides say that they were a waste of time but if it's a large, formal wedding then they are a must.  Especially Catholic services.  It won't look tacky.  Do what you can afford. :)|`|AA11312653	Why have programs at all? A mere 30 years ago no one had ever heard of such a thing. If your ceremony is so complex that people need a written handout to understand what is going on, then your ceremony is far too complex and elaborate. If people are dying to know the name of a song or a bridesmaid, then they can find out at the reception.     I know that it is hard to believe when you are in a Wedding Industry induced altered mental state, but most people won't even notice whether or not you have programs or favors.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I agree with some of the other posters. Print off what you feel comfortable  tell the person handing them out to give them to each couple and once they're gone their gone.   Most times a couple will share a program just like they share hymn books or prayer books.  You don't have to give programs to every guest as not every guest will want to have them.  I think it's really sad the number of programs thrown out at the end of the event.|`|AA12279950	Nothing cheap or tacky about it - one program between two guests is just fine x|`|PqGCeIelaa	I would give one to everyone.  But why don't you make your own. You can just design your own programs and take them to a printer it will be a lot less.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	Etiquette says if you do programs one should be provided for every guest.  You can save a ton though by making them yourself.  It may sound cheap but Hobby Lobby has really cute printable programs so you can just buy them there and have Kinko's print them for you.  It will save a ton.  If you have 40 guests you are going to want at least 10 extra.  We had some people show you didn't RSVP, though others did RSVP and not show you want to make sure you have plenty incase you get some extras.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah maybe you should get one program for each couple and then another 50% more in case each person in some of the couples wants their own program.  I go to a lot of weddings with my bf but we don't life together, so I want my own program for my memory box at home and he wants his own too, even though he also takes the place card...I guess he's just sentimental...|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I would plan for somewhere in the middle, because some guests won't take any and some, like Grandma, might take more than one.
vBkGGYJSaa	she gave you her number and you did not call her, bad deal on your part.<br>  she now figures that you are not interested in her.<br>  call and talk to her and see if she wants to go out with you.<br>  she is waiting for you to make the first move.<br>  it is all in your ball court.<br>  if you take to long she may not be interested any more.<br>  it is your life the choice is all yours.
1H56FPt8aa	Why did you do all this in the first place? Just make this "friend" go away. delete the account and tell your real friend you don't know what happened.|`|ZJsjD4JHaa	don't lie just be honest and tell the truth it might hurt but its worth it so your friend want have any outside thouhgts on why did she stop talking to me...Just say it was all an joke. You would want somebody to be honest with you so do the right thing.|`|4ZGriYvGaa	haha ive done that a few times..    just dont go on that pretend email anymore, like never ever again. and your friend will eventually forget about this fake person and it wont matter anymore.      change the password to something without seeing what you type and when you have to type the password for the second time to confirm, copy and paste it in the password thing so then you wont be tempted to use it anymore    or better still just delete the whole account.  delete the pics, delete everything    this fake person will be forgotten in time|`|LxcYzV7iaa	just stop the account and you be like omg she went to another country where there are no computers or just make up that shes running away from the police or something like that|`|StqBr5XRaa	just come clean and get chapter over in your life|`|U2XCZHilaa	yea. delete the account. DONE.     just pretend that this whole thing did not happen. live your life.    if your friend asks about this made up friend, tell her you lost contacts. done. easy as that.|`|6qljYOO2aa	Smooth.  You're smart...    Just end the accounts and be yoself next time.|`|AA11171280	Good heavens, get a life and get off the computer.    What you "do" is to just cut off those accounts and don't answer anything any more. Period.    Go back to living real life.    YOU are in control of your life!|`|6MHuI3NXaa	why would you spread a rumour about your self?  your stupid, go play in traffic.|`|Tv9Kqzo7aa	i do that all the time to me its hilarious. they dont really ask about the people i make up anymore but i just stop telling her stuff about "the made up person" and my friend i think forgot. you could tell her the truth and say it was just a small joke or just delet the yahoo messenger name and make sure theres no way she could contact her anymore and just tell her "u dont know wat happend to her" lol. :) thats the best i got!|`|s6OuNvxEaa	i sort of know what you feel as my best friend made up a "friend" as well, she realized it was a bad thing to do and told me as she trusted me. I told her to go on her "friends" account and say you wouldn't be able to talk anymore as your mum was taking the internet away because it causes arguments or something. So then if any of your real friends ask you for more detail you can just tell them the internet story :) don't feel bad sometimes we do things as we get bored with our own lives. I hope it all gets sorted out for you though   x x|`|AA10355211	tell her it was a joke you were just playing and now things are going to far and you just want it to stop honesty is the best. hey she might even laugh at you and say your silly. if you were my friend i would just as why thats all.|`|iK3qwwNraa	its your wish..your life...your control over all of this.............sooooo do as your mind says to do cuz even if we advise you, you're lastly going to do the thing that you want..right??
1rLMB7qyaa	Meaning she doesn't want nobody right now and in the future lets say maybe 3 months to a year she will want a boyfriend   anymore problem email me ..and tell me your problem because i get alot of questions and i might forget but ..yah you can email me at   sabrina.david@ymail.com  Make sure you tell me your problem|`|AA10873763	It doesn't matter.  She doesn't want to be more than friends.  But probably not.  She just doesn't want to come right out and say it because she doesn't want to hurt your feelings.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	It means that if you prove you can keep your shlt together more than a couple of hours, you might have a chance to score at a later date...|`|RoTLnFGZaa	She doesn't want to get into a relationship right now.|`|AA11441704	who knows?|`|oKY0s2THaa	Chances aren't likely :\ That may be her way of letting you down without hurting your feelings.|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	I would say that if I'm not into the person, but I would like to get to know them more, and then what happens, happens.    A girl usually says that if they have rushed into other relationships and it hasn't worked out.|`|YyFexhd3aa	she means that she is not into anybody right now ....|`|M0GoGVHXaa	Not at the moment.. but there is hope :)|`|1wdcprkGaa	it means your wack and jus need to move on|`|Ps7uyaomaa	If she isnt into you now, then she is not worth your time
AA12041870	You say that he left her for you at the top of the story, and at the bottom you say that he had already left her.  It seems to me that you may have been horning in on her man before she decided to horn in on your marriage now.  Maybe she is doing it to make you mad because he left her for you.  There may be nothing going on between them at all, or she may be making him feel very guilty for leaving her for you.  You will probably never, ever have the answer to it.        My advice-let him know how you feel about his conversations to his ex.  That is all you can do.  You can't control who he sees or talks to.  That would be wrong.  Keep your composure and make his home the place he wants to be.  I wish you luck.  I can't stand a cheater.  I hope he isn't one.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	KARMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL LOL hows it feel??? GOOD???  NAW>>> I didn't think so??|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Nope, no ADVICE. Tell him how you feel maybe?|`|yy45iAbtaa	i think your husband is very disrespectful to you.and you need to put your foot down if he cared anything about your feelings he would get rid of this old flame.if i was you i would ask him to leave until he decides what he wants to be with you or to still have contact with her.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	your husband is carrying on a friendship with the woman he dated before meeting and marrying you?  And you're ok with that?!      Not in my house!  My husband and I put an end to all friendships with ex's when we met and married.  There is no reason for him to carry on this friendship and the fact that she is completely disrespectful to you adds fuel to the fire.  I'd make sure he put an end to that friendship ASAP.|`|0f5d692c2ddaae1a325f6df3f3c8059baa	no matter what you do it wont stop her from calling him unless he puts a stop to it then it wont stop. you also did not mention how did they start up chatting together or why. speak to your husband make him understand how you feel about their relationship. don't yell at him, talk to him but put facts on top of the table. Give him ultimatum that he can get the idea how much you dont want him to communicate with her.|`|AA11591803	He knows his usual playground is closed for remodeling and he wants to play on his old playground again.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Sounds like a boarder skirmish ... some unresolved territorial issues.    So ... define the line, have a sit down and set up some rules and if she is really an "EX" there should be no need to further the relationship ... problem solved.    Congrats on the Baby !|`|CU1xZbbxaa	Seriously, if there are no children between the two, and he claims to be over her, and if they really are not friends----then he should get her the heck out of his and your life. If they are friends and it was a mutual breakup and nobody hates anybody, then I say they can be friends. BUT!!!!!--If she disrespects you and he knows this...I don't care if it's one of his guy friends or if it's his mother--He should be the one to be strong enough to say to them that they either cut that out immediately--or get away from both of you and stay away.    He needs to get the guts to stand up for you to ANY AND ALL OTHER PEOPLE if they disrespect you.    The Ex sounds insecure and like she enjoys messing with your mind. He should be the one to get her off of that trip, or get her out of your lives together forever.    I hope this works out for you both soon, because you are not in a good state of mind to be carrying a little girl, you need to feel super loved and know it to be true, not just hope it.    Good luck!|`|AG3dYL84aa	As a guy I have to agree with the other women.  You need to put your foot down.  No good man would ever do this to his wife.      He is being very immature.  He just never learned to let go of a woman.  Because you did not learn this before he has a habit of it now. (I think you were right about the way you tried to handle it).  He simply does not see your point of view.    It's time to drag him to a relationship counselor to get out your feelings.  When he realizes that he can't let go and needs to learn how to then this should end.  Good luck.|`|tzbYqdj6aa	you need to talk to him about it..communication is the key to any relationship..Good luck...mildred is my leader|`|iH2whFkHaa	I've answered a couple of your previous questions on this subject and you keep saying you sound crazy, jealous, hormonal etc. YOU DON'T!!! I would flip out if I found out my husband was 'friends' with his ex, and I'm sure most other women as well.     My eternal question is, why on earth is she so important to him still? so so so so important that he steps all over your feelings to stay in contact with her after the multiple times you've tried to get through to him.    I really don't blame you for checking on him all the time; you don't trust him and he earned that from you. But that might be what is driving him. He may just feel so trapped by your fencing him in and checking up on him that he feels he has to do it. You know how when you are a kid and somebody tells you not to do something; it only makes you want to do it more? Yeah. like that. That is human nature. doesn't give him an excuse, but maybe if you could try and trust him a little bit he would try at least.     Try to start all over with this whole thing; choose a time when you're both relaxed and in a good mood and have time; and sit down and talk about how you feel again and basically let him know that it's hard but you'll try to ease up on the detective work if he tries to start breaking things off with his ex. Your attitude when you're talking to him is very important, here are some basic rules for having civilized (and effective)discussions which I've always found helpful:    Listening: always listen until the other person has finished talking and then wait a few seconds before responding; and think about what they said before responding.    Speak softly: if one of you is a person who has trouble not yelling then try talking in whispers.    Start sentences with 'I' instead of 'You': for example say 'I feel like I am being ignored' instead of 'you are ignoring me'     Use eye contact    If one of you has to leave for a while to clear their head, don't just walk out in a huff--make sure to say 'I'll be back' before leaving.    Good luck.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	what goes around comes around|`|9e4f17e04f6a518df825311a06f819d2aa	I would never, ever put up with that. You've been too nice until now. Put the smackdown on him.

72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	it's fun and it creates attraction.    if they play with you, they tend to try to say that they like you.    from my experience of analysing a typical woman's mind:  they model men as these sheep who do not know what they want and are completely determined by their hormones and natural instincts.    of course, the typical woman is an immature, narrow minded idiot with the mental age of a 5 year old and lacks any understanding in gender differences. And of course, there are better women out there; they're just ridiculously hard to find. Anyway, back to my point...    with their model, they think they have the upper hand with their mental ability and think they can push your buttons. It's an ego thing that has been going on for eons.  their spontaneity can be deliberate to create mystery and make themselves interesting towards men. Those who are naturally spontaneous are particularly rare so it is often deliberate.  denial is a sport they play to keep you guessing - and to play hard to get (very unconvincingly). This would make them seem of someone more important than you so you will appreciate her more and give her more control of yourself - you typically see this in married couples where the husband lets the wife get the final say and whatever his opinion is most of the time gets ignored or manipulated into something that's not his. These are the men who chased their wifes and is stuck in that sort of predicament. Sometimes, they make silly wife jokes that you often see online. Some of these wifes play with men to get them interested in the first place or the men were conformed into doing this unnecessarily by social norms.    To counteract this (the beauty of the art):  ignore her for a while and pay attention to her when she has done something to deserve it (she does it to you, why not do it to her back)  banter back (an art in itself which takes time to master)  tease her  have the power to say no and walk away when you need it  do not be put off by jealousy  spank her or throw her out when she really annoys you  withdraw your attention when she does the little annoying things    hope this helps|`|AA10997370	Why do women play mind games??

a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	For some people, you know early on in the relationship that they will disappoint you.  Others, you don't find about until a later time - Maybe a year or more.     I've had three kinds of relationships.  The first kind is passionate at first, but dies out quickly.  The second is more long term, but we slowly grow apart.  The third is when you meet someone who you genuinely get along with - these relationships can last years, but they are usually destroyed by accumulated mistrust over time.  All those little things you did and said to each other add up over time, and the relationship eventually fails.  I've come to the conclusion that, for me, relationships all have a beginning and an end; and I'm ok with that.  Enjoy each other while you can and make the most of it!    Love is kind of a twisted thing.  When you are in love with someone, they become the center of your Universe, and you can't get that person out of your mind no matter how hard you try.  It forces people to stay in bad relationships.  Love is both extreme ends of a spectrum: The greatest pleasure and also the greatest pain.      Love is a zero sum game.  The Pleasure in the beginning + The Pain in the end = 0.|`|AA11441704	You can't, you are not God!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	There are always "signs".  I always hope that they won't.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	I agree.

It takes you numerous tries before she decides to go out with you. <br>  When a woman likes you, the response is usually a "yes" on your first attempt. If you have to badger or convince her to go out with you, that's a bad first sign.<br>  2. She'll only see you on a weekday. <br>  This means that she'd rather save her Friday and Saturday nights for something or someone better.<br>  3. She shows up to the date looking average. <br>  If she doesn't go out of her way to look better on the date than what she would look like going to the store you're in trouble.<br>  4.  She decides to meet you there. <br>  When a woman declines an offer to pick her up that means she might be plotting a quick getaway, ensuring no opportunity of a romantic ending to the date.<br>  5. She talks about other men she finds attractive. <br>  If you're name doesn't come up in that conversation, then you know where you stand.<br>  6. She only returns your calls after you've left numerous messages. <br>  You're just not that important on her list of priorities.<br>  7. There are too many awkward silences in your conversations. <br>  If you have to initiate conversation all the time and if you don't there are prolonged silences or pauses on her end, then she doesn't care enough to even pretend that your interaction is going well.<br>  8.

You really just have to learn from experience.  However, I highly recommend consulting friends for these types of issues.  <br>  <br>  Whenever a girl does something that makes you feel bad or upset, those are issues that you ought to think about and consider why you feel that way.  I promise you that issues that may seem small in the beginning will only grow bigger with time.  It's important to try to resolve them or at least discuss them with your significant other in the beginning before they blow out of proportion.  I like to talk to my friends about things I worry about and they provide helpful advice.  <br>  <br>  In any case, some people are actually capable of maintaining friendships with ex's but in most cases, there's still some type of tension and it's something that I personally, like to avoid.  <br>  <br>  It's never a good sign if she's hiding you from her friends!  When I'm with someone that I really like, I want my friends to meet him and vice versa!  Some girls will be more secretive when it comes to their parents, but that's more common and not necessarily terrible.  It is, however, something that she will eventually have to overcome!  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry she led you on for so long!  A lot of girls are selfish and will keep you around only because you make them feel good about themselves.

lcjMqzh9aa	no thats sweet =D i wouldnt find it clingy if my bf sed that =D x|`|1H56FPt8aa	No that means you want to be with her & your not letting some stupid little thing get in the way.|`|X9vsoxB2aa	That's what couples do usually... stay together... unless there is a reason for one of the partners to abandon the other.|`|P6wIQ4qDaa	People take things differently  the only person who knows the answer to this question is your girlfriend|`|ppEitEGhaa	No its not clingy if your serious about her and your in love with her.|`|rCu0cB75aa	It's not clingy because you have a certain attachment to this person. Also, when you're with a partner for so long, you can't help but grow an emotional attachment to him/her; its' human nature. It sounds like you're really confused. The fact of the matter is, if you truely love or care for her, and she doesn't feel the same way, it's natural for you to feel like the 'clingy' one, but truth is, if she doesn't want what you want or if she wants to break it off, you need to let her go. It's okay to want to stay with that person and it's okay to feel sh**ty when you decide to leave her...these emotional ties will cause you to feel this way, but it's a toxic relationship and it takes a little time to heal. But in the end, you'll seriously open your eyes and see you never loved her the way you thought you did...and ANYONE can back me up on that... You need to find somebody that loves you regardless and wants to BE WITH YOU JUST AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO BE WITH THEM. You deserve THAT much to say the least...|`|k6mYgCBXaa	It doesn't sound clingy to me. It sounds like you love her and want to make the relationship work! That is what people who are inlove with another person do after all...    I do wonder though if she has told you you are being clingy? Where did you get that idea? If she told you or implied you are being clingy then I would suggest that you back off a bit. Actually, a lot. Give her time to miss you. If you have tried talking with her and she is still not responsive to working things out gather up your courage and give her her space. Don't be too eager to return her phone calls, text messages, or emails. Let her see what it feels like to not have you around.    I went through something similar with my boyfriend. He was acting all wierd and finally told me that he just needed some time and space. So, I gave it to him. In fact, a month later I moved to Alaska. He coudn't believe it! Now, I am not suggesting you do something as drastic as moving to Alaska, but I will tell you that for me it worked like a charm (even though that wasn't why I did it) and 6 months later he moved from California to Alaska to be with me. : ) When I became unavailable to him he suddenly began to realize how much he missed me and I then had A LOT MORE VALUE in his eyes. It is human nature to want what they don't think they can have.    If your girlfriend is really considering breaking up with you over something trivial it may be worth your while to consider how much she really values you and your realtionship! And then figure out how to coerce her to see what a wonderful guy you are! It can be done.There are psychological factors in the human nature and once we are aware of them we can better understand how to deal with those underlying currents in a realtionship, the human psyche, and stop a break up from happening.    I wish you the best of luck!    http://www.urlfreeze.com/WA/Save_Your_Lo...|`|RoTLnFGZaa	i don't understand what you're saying.    no, it doesn't seem clingy. It seems like you're serious about her, if you love and don't want to break up with her.|`|wE2etBzbaa	No. why?  shouldn't that be the default? not to break up unless there is something serious? or am I missing some fun things?|`|fDhOFwX9aa	Normal if you are in love.
61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	Actually, it sounds like he has moved on... You're the one that's stalking him thinking he's doing stuff to make you jealous.  Listen... It's not all about you.  <br>  <br>  Also, you're the one that slapped him.  <br>  If it were the other way around, I'd advise you to leave too.<br>  <br>  Edit... Reading all the answers... Wow! You're all messed up or in junior high school.  There's no maturity or responsibility at all.  Scary!|`|G3emC90haa	he still has feelings.|`|5d94V16uaa	Well you probably shouldn't have hit him, unless of course he did something really inappropriate and even then it's not such a great idea.  Anyways enough of my lecture, sorry about that.  If you want to get back at him, do what I'd do and sleep with his best friend.  He'll get the message.|`|UxFJ4gcJaa	If you're trying to move on, then you need to ignore him. Don't stalk him on facebook. Don't talk to him. Don't communicate AT ALL. By what you've said, he's moving on better than you are. You won't leave the boy alone! Stop stalking! haha~|`|FHm7LGPSaa	maybe he deserved to get slapped who knows you didn't say...<br>  Sounds like you need to move on, quit checkin on him, and his friends, move on enjoy life, it's too short|`|PDAVQU3Caa	because he want to make you feel bad, if  u act as if ur not bothered by it he will stop. hope i helped.|`|xz9DNQBpaa	Its your true love which makes you jealous. You can call on him and express yourself. Every thing will be ok. Have a great going.|`|0AIbzmo7aa	he still likes you<br>  he just got mad that you slapped him so he broke up with you|`|PLsJpPqOaa	why don't you truthfully just try to be very sincere and ask him why he's doing that... TRUTHFULLY... you know??
DQcZWFHFaa	If you don't have a preference, you can always say something like, "Well I like to see movies, listen to music, and go to the beach - do any of those sound good to you?"  Then you've got kind of a mutual choice starting to happen, and you've also suggested some ideas for future dates if any.|`|DRQhEILTaa	Yeah guys never know where to go! haha<br>  but as a first date you can go get something to eat and go to the movies. Usually go to a place to eat where you can talk and get to know each other better or have fun like a place with alot of video games.<br>   and just go to the movies and see either a funny film or a scary film.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped!!|`|hJDbOKR6aa	If you really don't have a preference, tell him that. But I would suggest doing something active rather than just dinner and movie. Like mini golf, beach, park, carnival, etc
MZbQ5MPdaa	Yes, it normal. Parents just accept and expect it.Someday when you grow up,you'll  be a parent and you'll have the same thing with your children. You will also understand what you've done and apologize to you parents. It's ok to argue or disagree but please be respectful to them They love you and only want what's best for you. As long as you show respect and remember this, everything will work out.<br>  As the saying goes"This too shall pass" Good luck and enjoy your teen years! Someday you'll be a  parent!|`|aXYiOskmaa	i think so, but really, what's the point? most of those arguments are just for the sake of arguing and are really stupid.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Of course it is, mostly because neither part compromises easily - or sometimes at all.|`|kulDK5jsaa	no your probably possessed by either a demon or satan himself, go talk to your pastor|`|f17RMVa3aa	yeah pretty much, but i've realized that if you're nice you get so much more|`|72df64d291deb659fd8f62b0c3330639aa	i hope so, thats all i do =/|`|2dESDCBnaa	omg YES! its horrible but i argue wit my parents A LOT and most of the time we dont even do anything, they just feel the need to bug us or yell at us for SOMETHING that we did wrong... its completely normal, and im sure u hate it as much as i do D:|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Depends what the argument is about, Or course its natural, your discussing issues not arguing|`|UxRoUTvCaa	Yep.|`|pre1k4Pqaa	yess
m67d5nHcaa	In sociology I learned everyone is sexual.  I have a boyfriend that I have been with for a year in 3 days and before that we were best friends for 4 years :)  and I am absolutely 100 percent in love with him.  I live over 700 miles away because I went away to school, and yes when I have been drinking it has crossed my mind to kiss a boy.  Its only natural, but then I think, how much does my boyfriend mean to me?  I think it is pointless to cheat on someone that you really truly care for.  Why be with them then?<br>  <br>  You can see that you friend adores you and you like attention from the opposite sex, that is not a crime, who doesnt?  I wouldnt advise to act on it, because if you and your bf end up breaking up and down the road you end up dating your best friend, your best friend will always have it in his mind that you cheated on someone that you were 100 percent in love with. <br>  I would say that you have to evaluate your relationship, it is important that you aren't with your boyfriend until someone better comes along, but because you truly want to be.  <br>  <br>  good luck...|`|AA11162050	Good Grief!  You are not married.  Kiss the friend; it might be good.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking about this then you are not "10000% in love" with the BR.  Be honest to yourself.|`|AA11953643	Sounds like you're really not that in love. You might love your boyfriend but in love just doesn't sound like it's the case. <br>  <br>  When you are in love with someone - you wouldn't even consider kissing someone else.|`|3a55712b3cb785f3ac9cb6ceb18b43abaa	If u r so sure that u luv ur bf so much then there is no question of mixed feelings. U cant sail in two boats at the same time. Be loyal in ur relationship n forget that other guy. U can just b his frnd|`|AA11693333	i am actually going through the same thing with a friend of three years and i want to be with him but at the same time its like you have to see that you are good friends and maybe being together or just hooking up isn't the best thing to do for your friendship and you do you have a boyfriend. i think you should just maybe tell your friend whats going on and tell him that he should back off a little!|`|CQm93kkHaa	Think deeply about this. Here is a golden opportunity to be with someone that admires you, but if doubts persist in your mind share them with the person that likes you most. His answer may surprise you, he may say "explore" your options.  Be wary, that maybe his trump card to his "exploration". Skip the booze that is a crutch honesty is still the best policy|`|euW2qbolaa	one is not enough for you to go run after onother one......(`;`)<br>  ohh GOD,,,,,,,,bless your servents.
W0KQTXrvaa	one man one woman end of the story|`|iblT1HJpaa	Usually, love has nothing to do with it.|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	LOL...polygamy is natural for ALL males. what red-blooded man doesn't want to be able to choose from his harem which wife he will sleep with tonight? but just because it's natural, doesn't make it right....it's quite natural to be selfish (check out the average toddler, let me know if they aren't selfish without being taught), but that doesn't make it right. I thought I was in love with two women at the same time, but in time, I realized I just loved one, and lusted after the other....|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Yes, you're wrong.  It is within many humans' capability, male and female, to love more than one person.  Most people don't like to believe that, and I'm sure that many people truly are incapable of it.  Some people, though, can and do love more than one person.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	I don't understand Monogomy but my wife does.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes possibly you are wrong. To some people loving spouses is like loving a number of children. Honestly I'm not condoning polygamy but I'm not condemning it either.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	And what about women who loves few men?|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Love does not have a universal meaning. If one man can love 3 women, he does. If you can only love one woman, than you can only love one woman. Love is not a black and white subject, it is different for all cultures and belief systems.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	Polygamy is natural for few males. Love is too much definition oriented.|`|gj6rpPjYaa	You are wrong. Only women don't understand such things; because they are not men. Men love women like others love toys. You can love few toys and truly love them all. Loving one toy does not stop you loving other toys. Many a man see girls as toys: mere play things to have fun with. When the man matures or gets married, he suddenly realizes how wrong he had been. He tries to make adjustments. But that still doesn't stop him loving many women at the same time.  Women are not like that. They can truly love only one man at a time. It's not in them to love like men. That is why they can't understand why men are the way they are. Women are not wrong; men are not wrong either. It's just the way we were made.|`|v2a220YWaa	watch the HBO series big love, it will explain it all.
sB9xp8wraa	Love starts out initially as a physical attraction, but as time passes, it goes deeper than that. As my Grandfather used to say, "What's on the outside attracts 'em, but it's what's on the inside that keeps 'em".|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	That's NOT why I fell in love with my Girlfriend (by the way, I'll be 23 in March & she's turning 35 in May). I love & adore her with all of my heart & soul & she loves me back just the same (if not more). Nothing will change the way I feel about her in my heart.    You obviously don't believe in true love.|`|0zdHykkSaa	because eventually, everyone gets old and wrinkly unless you have a bunch of dumb surgeries that make you look like a freak.    it's the way of life.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Most likely because we know what love is and you don't.  As you age your look does change, but look in the mirror so does yours. No matter,  loving a person is loving all of them, not how they look its how they make you feel inside.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Love is from the heart. Not the eyes.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	with all your heart.|`|RoEyFm5yaa	YOU WERE PROBABLY BETTER LOOKING THEN TOO.
paerqxfMaa	Yes, men change also - it's called growing older - learning from experience - gaining wisdom you don't have in your 20's, but usually people's basic personalities don't change.  Although there are a number of life situations that can cause personalities to change; mental illness, divorce, death of a loved one, a serious physical illness, an abusive relationship, etc.  You can only choose the one you love, you can't choose the situations that life will throw your way - but I know I'd want the one that will stand by me through thick and thin.|`|AA12059817	Yeah, they change-they get more sophisticated..and a lot more sexy!!!
CRHrrFnPaa	Ask her if she needs a hand!|`|LxcYzV7iaa	CONFRONT HER ABOUT IT|`|TT52i29oaa	She may be doing this:    *attention  *Bra rash or anything else bra related  *early stages of being pregnant (woman touch their boobs A LOT)  *Habit  *She might be cold >.0  *Might have a child breast feeding  *Have a bruise (yes....it's disgusting 0.0)  *Sensitive N-nipples          If it's annoying only one of you guys talk to her about it and she may stop|`|7Cbel1Hkaa	i duno why she is doin that but send me a pic of her at it|`|DmzKjhkvaa	She thinks this will help her to her job.|`|7wUnY6LGaa	Myabe its that time of the month . lol
HnGAxJ2uaa	no penetration, no cheating|`|AA11706291	Yeah its cheating.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Tee heee you naughty girl.. of course its cheating..|`|AA11011446	Dear jesus yes of course this is cheating.  That's a terrible thing to do.  How would you feel if another woman was touching your husband's balls??|`|i7o8yC5Uaa	No, course it does'nt. When that other bloke has finished then pass them over here.|`|IF95rI2aaa	That is really bad, you should never let another man touch you in any way unless its your husband, if you, i think you need to consider your relationship with him.     that is not a good thing, you need to tell him.|`|AA11089526	mmmmmmmmmmmmmm, do you have to ask...thanks for the 2 points...|`|xmmX3JTRaa	Yes, it is. You allowed another person to touch you and you also have an orgasm.    You cheated, it happened. Just remember not to do it again.    We all make mistakes, the important part is we do not repeat them.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	If you have to ask yourself that, then it is.|`|dDasUgW8aa	Uh, yeah, I'd say so.  To me, anything that I would not do in front of my husband with another person is considered cheating.|`|396f017f9409bc4d7e22a267e6a23b7baa	OMG!!! yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,YES!!!!!  if you wouldnt do it in front of your husband then its cheating!!!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Good grief, yes its cheating its touching in a sexual way dont you know that ? I mean if your husband had climaxed because a girl had touched his penis would you count that as cheating on you ?|`|X7rPWJU8aa	would you be thrilled to find your hubby feeling another woman's breast? wouldn't you think that it was cheating if the shoe was on the other foot?. geesh people come on if you aren't willing to do it in front of your partner then you probably shouldn't be doing it|`|HWojJn0qaa	I think it depends on the partner. My boyfriend would consider it cheating.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Err, a little while ago you were a 55 yr old businessman with a hot 25 yr old secretary......... Quick sex change!!!|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If you have to ask then it is considered cheating.|`|djAyXS9Iaa	How stupid and pathetic are you, having to ask this - of course it's cheating|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Of course it's cheating... you really need to ask???.........(sigh).|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Would it be cheating if he let strange women touch his dick and he orgasms from it?|`|0nW8wMBdaa	It's only cheating if your husband doesn't approve of it and you did this without agreeing this in advance.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	If you are worried enough about it to have to ask us the question then yes it definitely is cheating.  Still....maybe your husband feels other women's breasts and gives them orgasms and doesn't tell you?  How do you feel about that?
AA11603468	You can actually only get pregnant for a very few days a month, so it doesn't matter if you "get your freak on" 20 times a day, unless its during HER fertile time, you're not getting pregnant.|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Dude if wanting a baby isn't doing I don't know what will! But have you tried some romance? I know my husband thinks it should just happen. But try making an evening of it. Buy her some flowers, give her a massage. While massaging move to the naughty parts slowly and gently, pleasure her first and then get the baby making part going! I think you on top is the best way to concieve lol|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Try explaining the process .... In, out, in, out, in, out ... repeat if needed.  Oh yeah use the front door !  Baby batter always works best in the oven .....    Or...    Perhaps she really isn't ready for a child .... have a long talk and wait a while ... she what shakes out.    Good Luck.|`|IcH5gMICaa	I agree with 3rd answerer.  Those are not going to help at all if all she does in THINK about it.  You have to NOT think about it and get your freak on that THAT'S when you have a baby -works with everyone I know including myself.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Why is she taking fertility drugs if she's limited sex? Has she been living in a cave and believes the drugs alone will make her pregnant. The more you have sex the more likely she will get pregnant..or at least that's what i've always thought. And shouldn't be tracking her ovulation and having you rush home to get it on because they increases chances any more. Are you sure she wants a child?|`|ZkEicvapaa	ummm bud there is someting wrong there. do you have a little dick or what? becuase i am sure everyone likes sex!!! she might be ****** someone else|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	forget the vitamins/chlomid  she is already thinking about it too much.     its really quite natural what you have to do.|`|zTbG7rH1aa	try some romantic introduction, then a little work out down there to make her want sex..if your doing everything and nothing goes out fine..then doubt if she loves you, coz if woman loves a guy she will give almost all that she can give, the fact that your married is big deal.|`|v2a220YWaa	it is a proven fact that it takes about 48 hours to reproduce healthy sperm after sex, you should be doing it every other day, or less, for best results.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	She either wants it or doesn`t. If she doesn`t, guess you need to spruce up your appearance, like work out, look and smell good and clean always.
aX1nszStaa	just tell him how u feel it seems like he likes u <br>  i was in the same position a while back except im a guy|`|9QWmy13Daa	hes playing you on go with it and watch he wants you its obvious he just wants you to show if you want him first most guys don't want to make the first move they try to imply it when they want a sign from you|`|jFDYp9TKaa	ignor his comment and ask him out.. but be prepared for rejection.. or a yes!! Who knows what he thinks!? I don't. Sounds like he's in love with you.. or he likes this othr girl.. i mean just tak a damn chance! I did it twice and it werked well for me.. same situation too.<br>  <br>  Aother choice is aska  friend to ask him if you and him wouuld go out.<br>  "Well would you if she wanted to?" or some crap like that..<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and guys have to remember NOT to talk about other girls in front of girls they LIKE!! I made that mistake.. wait no.. I STILL MAKE THAT MISTAKE!! So just do what ever your gona do! If hes a true friend he won't hate you or whatever your silly fear is if you happen to ask him out. Go for it!|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	That doesn't always mean something.<br>  <br>  More often that not it doesn't mean anything, in fact.<br>  <br>  Personally, I get pissed off at the whole "you have to think I'm the only pretty girl in the world" mentality, so I will purposely answer "Yeah she's pretty" if questioned. I will of course still only be interested in the girl in question.<br>  <br>  and as always, it varies from guy to guy. But this should be obvious.|`|XKedNluaaa	i think he made a very interesting approach. as a guy i say he's trying to make you jealous or something, to see if you like him like him :p as more than a friend. i mean that's what it seems to me!<br>  <br>  you should tell him you like him.<br>  i can't say the words exactly, but do tell him.<br>  <br>  you could even ask him something like "do you know they say we're the cutest/nicest/whatever couple in school/something ?<br>  how 'bout we give it a try?" and maybe give him a kiss on the cheek. and leave it there, give him time to think a bit about it.<br>  <br>  if i'd like you, and you'd say this to me, i'd immediately give you an immense hug and ask you out somewhere right there!|`|il9tsxRSaa	i think he's just as confused as you and possibly trying to give you some sort of signal without saying anything (because unless he says something, it "might not mean anything").. in a way he's testing the waters with you to see if you will respond because he doesnt want to jump the gun and end up making a fool of himself..<br>  <br>  this was the same situation with me =)<br>  <br>  mixed signals all around but then there would be other signals that made me think he liked another girl.. and so i held back until finally, we both started giving each other signals and he finally admitted all this time that he was trying to let me know but wasnt sure if i felt the same way and so held back abit until he couldnt any more =)<br>  <br>  u dont necessarily have to say anything, if you feel comfortable and dont mind him... just let him know.. show him that you enjoy his company, smile.. hold his hand.. and when you're ready tell him how you feel (what have u got to lose?) my current bf risked it when he told me but it ended up going out way =).. and who knows if u start showing him signals, he might end up being the one to tell u !!<br>  <br>  dont think about the other friend because im sure he's just using her as a conversation and if he's that comfortable with you, he's not interested in her at all and probably only sees her as someone attractive bt nothing further ...<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|AA10622411	It sounds like he really likes you, but it seems like you are unsure if you want him to become your boyfriend. I would think your decision through very carefully because you do not want to jeopardize your friendship if your relationship failed. However, some of my best boyfriends have started out as close friends. Good luck!|`|sfEMRwRWaa	as a guy with ladyfriends i can tell you this. no guy is friends with a girl that he is not interested in. when i say a girl is hot in front of my friend i want to make her jealous and see how she reacts. i would say go for it and have fun and see where it goes.|`|ON8cmcHtaa	i would say just go for it<br>  you live your life once, so be who you are and say what you want, because those you matter don't care, and those who care don't matter|`|rOAcD4HXaa	I think if your not seeing anybody else this is your boyfriend. He may actually be making sure that your not seeing anyone else. hard to tell at this distance.|`|XHE26P1uaa	I SAY GO FOR IT:)

fDhOFwX9aa	Scared because they might loss the one they love and get hurt. And also scared because they care too much about what she will think about him and become lack of confident. Scared that they are unable to give happiness to the one they love but yet they will feel sad if they cannot be together with their love one. In another word, men or women when they are in love, they are the most vulnerable. But men sense it better than women.|`|968KfJjqaa	That must be a bad joke. I've never been scared, duh..    Depends on what kinda scared you get, the love scared thing isn't only boys, but girls too.|`|L7NT0yjYaa	Some guys when they fall in love they get scared because it's their first time, or because they had a bad experience ..  when its the first time .. they may feel different a bit romantic and weak and this feelings may make them feel less strong than before .. so they tend to get scared and may even ran the other direction ..  and if had a bad experience picture thing yourself .. they are afraid of getting hurt again..  but in my opinion the guys that get scared the most .. are the bad boys .. who used to play around and take advantage of girls who loved them ... because they know what might happen when somebody is in love he or she becomes blind and people may hurt them like they used to do to others .. .  hope i helped|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	SCARED OF GETTING HURT OR WORSE....

The last girl I fell for told me she couldn't tell how I felt about her because I would keep changing how I acted.|`|8rM5W0EBaa	because some guys have an image and when they fall for some one they are scared of what they feel and they have never felt that way before|`|91ca82de9e31e75dc359de11826647adaa	You are making yourself vulnerable to another person, I can totally understand why some people would find that scary!|`|AA11171280	It's not just guys. But the fear comes from the vulnerability of your soul when you're in love. You open yourself up for rejection, for loss, for all sorts of things.    But it's worth it in the end...|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Some guys get scared because they've been hurt before others get scared because they dont realy know what love is and the rest are scare because they've never been in love.

Always fight back.|`|sfhO4zbsaa	Be the bigger person and not sink to her level AGAIN|`|FQU9JgLraa	teenagers have no clue|`|mbNWBem6aa	I know I would be tempted to snap back at her too...  but think of it this way.    She'll probably cheat on him again.  He's an *** for leaving you for her again.  And he's probably do it again.    Just stay away from both of them, you don't need that kind of trouble in your life.     She's very immature for doing that to you. Just stop responding or come up with a witty final word like "whatever, he's your problem now"    And ignore them.   You'll find a better person than that someday, don't worry.

Is their someone that you know that objects to affection?|`|EZyHOht7aa	By the time men get that old they just want to be left alone, no offense, I reccomend no affection.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	Yes|`|FeRC5jkoaa	nope. they like a cold-hearted b*tch who will belittle him every chance she gets.|`|UVciAbXxaa	its all depends on ur attentions if ur being affectionate an there is a chance for like a relationship then yea but other wise no cause then we feel that were being led on|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Who knows- they probably would get weirded out if a woman is being too affectionate for the type of relationship they have. I mean there is a reason why they are "just seeing" the person, most likely because they want the sex/ company but don't like her enough to actually date her. I would get out if you are a woman in that situation.|`|kOV3QIa5aa	Of course guys are flirts right?? So there gonna want girls to be the same way|`|IcAO0QuBaa	No then they think there being led on. <br>  I learned this the hard way.|`|Ybhgy5A1aa	seeing them

(calm down..,only joking).  But seriously, your right, it is a pretty lame question that only an immature guy would ask to a pretty lady.  Not a very good way to score points!

oG7Hddvsaa	I think you should just give up on him. He only cares about what he wants, not what you want. A guy should always put his girlfriend first instead of being selfish and self centered. He is not the right guy for you.|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	When he said he wanted to just be friends. He meant it the way girls say it to me. Sorry there are better guys out there for you to consider.|`|XasLRQnXaa	Don't even try to talk to him, he was only trying to use you. He doesn't really want to be friends, sorry to hear that :[.|`|hmLo323Uaa	I respect you for sticking to your boundaries.  Simply put, you have been tossed aside. You did not give him what he wanted, he eased your feelings by using the “o.k. we will still be friends”…and has moved on.  He is a coward for pretending you are not in the room, but I am afraid that is just how some people act in uncomfortable situations.<br>  <br>  Stick to your principles. You know who your friends are. There are plenty of great guys/gals out there for you.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  BP<br>  <br>  *edited for spelling.
48W167cBaa	Bring your iPod, and have it on a low, low volume until you fall asleep- seems to get me to drift off pretty quick on an early night to bed. <br>  <br>  I was going to suggest a book, but then again, going to sleep usually means to no lights, so that won't work.<br>  <br>  When's the sleepover? If you have a few days between now and then, head to bed early these few upcoming days. It might help you get used to the early bed time- it might mess up your 'sleeping schedule', but you can always return to normal afterwords.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|TpLnA012aa	It doesnt sound like much of a sleepover if you all fall asleep at nine.|`|339b4238208a222953efaf761bcadf81aa	Go to the room where her parents are in your underwear, and tell them you're joing THEM.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Take some benedryl.

ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	well im sure you are probably the ugliest guy ever.<br>  first of all.  she probably only asked you out because she felt sorry for you. second of all, i've read your other questions and you ask the stupidest questions, like "why does my butt itch?" hahahaha. and you said you had a gay boyfriend. very interesting. maybe have some old smelly hippie scratch your a** for you, or your mother. and maybe shave it. that'll help.<br>  your probably an inbred too. or deformed. <br>  so yeah moron, delete your yahoo answers account and go find your gay boyfriend, or at least leave us good people alone, we have better things to do then answer your dumb made-up questions.<br>  and as for your "girlfriend" which i'm pretty sure you made up too, but just in case,<br>  i hope she dumps you and finds better things in life. honestly. or at least something attractive. <br>  seriously, it looks like someone needs to be put in the nuthouse. but it aint the girlfriend. even though you probably dont have one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love Chelsea!!!! :]|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	OMG! You're a bad person.  Just saying.  My boyfriends father died when he was in his 20s and he was an emotional wreck for a lot longer than 1 week?  It's an extremely hard thing to deal with, she will likely be sad about this for a good deal longer, and she is absolutely right, your insensitive.  But don't worry, I'm sure when she recovers enough from this she'll dump your *** and find someone worth calling her boy friend.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You're a selfish, insensitive prick.<br>  <br>  Her father died only a week ago.  He was her dad, not some random uncle she met once.  It's gonna take a long time for her to "get over it".  You want to make her happy, tell her to find a better boyfriend who's concerned about her more than he is anal sex.  |`|IiFFPlIZaa	haha its so funny that people are actually taking this question seriously!! theyre like "omg, ur soo mean"<br>  so obvious u made it up coz u just wanna see peoples reactions.. cause ur boredd.. or sumthin.. <br>  im bored too :( <br>  yea.. |`|AA11524142	i assume you're joking...|`|QS3PtXg8aa	well daz mean i fink ny1 wud b cryin,err dazz jus bien a jerk u shud b nxt 2 her |`|mLSZ3YsWaa	Ops,cant you see why she is unhappy?<br>  You  don't seems to be a very carrying person,can't you see her dad died very recently.  <br>  You should understand her<br>  <br>  A real man would never do such a thing,oh yes she ruin your plans for anal sex,S****<br>  <br>  Open your eyes mate,and find a mirror and look on it?<br>  <br>  What can you see?<br>  <br>  Who's reflections you can see?<br>  <br>  Its you who makes her unhappy.<br>  I just hope for your sake she hasn't got brothers,or tell them about you been such a P******* you mite be in a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>  BE THERE FOR HERE WHEN SHE NEED YOU THE MOST,but not kick her out.<br>  |`|v1pKEtaYaa	Bro her dad died you *** she is going to be upset for a wile! telling her to get over it, wtf you need to support her not tell her to get over it. sex should be the last thing on your mind right now, help her out she is only 15 and her dad died come on what are you thinking support her man be a boy friend she needs support throught this hole thing it is going to be a wile befor she gets over it! |`|e12914f2e881daad3e9007ea44fdd7a1aa	I agree with Chelsea. haha i think she has the best answer here.[looking at the other ones]<br>  and i think your original question, "why is my girlfriend unhappy" is the most idiotic thing i have ever seen in my entire life...hmm i really wonder? maybe becuase she didnt get to have buttsex with you?! Or maybe becuase her dad died...its so hard to figure out.<br>  seriously, delete this and get a life. Do you honestly have nothing better to do then post questions like this?|`|FTZIQKxEaa	i hate questions like this... i cant tell if ur really that big of an idiot or if ur kidding in a very not funny way.  just in case there's the slight chance that ur really that big of an idiot here's the answer to your question: she's 15, you shouldnt be having sex.  and also u need more than a week to get over a dead parent|`|ZJTx5m5qaa	Her DAD died. It could take her weeks or even months to get over it, and you want to introduce her to anal sex? You're being incredibly selfish and really an asshole. If you treat her like that and can't see why she's unhappy, don't be surprised when she breaks up with you.|`|l6GukAVIaa	your a jerk she is 15 yrs old and her dad passed away and the only thing you are thinking about is using her for sex you ought to be ashamed of yourself I hope she dumps you my father passed away two yrs ago and there are times I miss him so much. Grow up!!|`|NIZeOSKmaa	OMG are you serious? All you can think about is sex! When the man who raised her died. It takes years to heal and your not even her friend to be there for her.

e35e563de072fa05692e56acda24a6e9aa	My guess would be that women have affairs because they need a man to love them, to make them feel good about themselves because they are lacking those things with their husbands.  Usually when a man cheats it is only for the sex.  Therefore the female species understand because they  feel neglected by their husbands to. I am not saying all woman feel this way, but many do.|`|bb6bpLZWaa	A lot of  people cheat because they are scared of being alone and that's a weakness. If he was abusive she could have left. I don't think cheating is ever a mistake either...its a character flaw. I also have a theory that the people who defend their unethical behaviors so thoroughly end up looking more guilty. I am sure shes ashamed and rightfully so. As for double standard, let's remember all cheaters feel they have their reasons. Most the time they put the non-guilty partner  in a bad light to make themselves seem less wicked...even women cheaters. No cheater is ever going to say to a stranger "my spouse is a good person and I just don't have any morals".|`|piuJwcNEaa	I think cheating is a cowards way out.<br>  I mean really, its less hurtful to tell your partner you hate them and never wanna see them again and they are the ugliest person on earth and so on.<br>  Why not just say "Its over" THEN move on. F***. Not so hard, gossh.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way cheating "makes her human" is because mankind suck. Theyre born to let others down and screw you over. (Wow, i sound so positive)<br>  Tis a harsh world. Lol!<br>  I think ANY person who cheats (even the person who the cheater is using; the cheaters accomplice) is scum. Male or Female.|`|2yUhUV2Iaa	This a site where everybody can give their opinion, or sides in any situation. For me there is no double standard when it comes to cheating. i both categorized man or woman as scum of the earth when they cheat on their marriage. |`|cc545de7b83dd08b07c800bbf176f022aa	Do you think this is the only woman who has cheated. Ok, she was ill-treated by her husband. But there are thousands of women out on the streets who are cheating regularly their loving husbands. How many of them are being categorised?|`|xpiGWrdMaa	That was ONE woman.  I hate cheaters in both sexes. |`|IKXZZDH9aa	Wow...women cheat because they are missing something from their husbands so other women can understand? That is the most insane CRAP I have ever heard. <br>  <br>  Men and women cheat for the SAME reasons and they are primarily emotional. The main reason men cheat is because they feel under appreciated and they are seeking that from some one else when the wife doesn't provide that to him. In fact, statistics showed that 48% of men cheat for that reason alone. <br>  <br>  When a man cheats, he is moving away bot sexually and emotionally from his spouse because he is getting what he needs from some one else...what does that sound very similar too?? A WOMAN CHEATING...WOW, who'da thunk it?!?!?|`|503eda43d54b7b89fca2061b6e2d22c2aa	I like the way you say "technically".<br>  This woman was verbally abused for a long time and her husband did not deserve her.<br>  She knows it's not ok.There is not a double standard for women. Different situations bring different thoughts.<br>  What if it was a guy that cheated because his wife was abusive to him?<br>  I wouldn't call him scum and have never called anyone scum but you seem to think all men are categorized as scum.<br>  <br>  I think not.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Because the world is full of double standards.<br>  <br>  If it's a crusade you are looking for you could do a whole lot better than this issue.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	No double standard here. Cheating is cheating regardless if it is done by a man or a woman. |`|GspKFIgnaa	All cheats are skanky, I think that would be the opinion of most people too, female or male it's just as hurtful and deceitful.
oIdQaEAUaa	Depends on when she gave you the number - you don't want it to be too early or too late. I wait usually two days after getting the number - that way you don't come across as desperate and needy - yet still interested! Not sure whether you're from the UK or US I think things work differently depending on where you are from here ... here's a possible dialogue between you and her ...   Boy: Oh hiya - how are you its x here? How have you been?   Girl: I'm good thanks - how are you?   Boy: Fine thanks - I was talking to x (a friend from where she works and you used to) and I thought of you and just rang to catch up and see how are you are? So are you still doing x (the job she used to whilst there)   Girl:  Yea I'm still etc ..    (Discuss her aspirations for future career etc)     Then finish off with ...     Boy: It was great talking with you - it'd be great to meet up for a drink sometime?   IT'S HERE WHERE YOU WILL GET THE ANSWER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IF SHE SAYS SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND THEN JUST TELL HER SHE WERE ONLY INTERESTED IN BEING FRIENDS (SAVES YOU AND HER FROM EMBARRASSMENT) IF SHE SAYS YES THEN ...   Boy: Actually why don't we fix a date now - how about and then tell her the place and the time you'd like to meet up. Make sure its as nice warm couples place not a boozer fit for boys etc.     Obviously it's just how I would do it and it gives you a bit of a start on how to do it ... you could work on it some more and make it much better! Best of Luck!|`|AA11441704	call early so that she can make a program|`|K8j8MRGwaa	yeah wait to call|`|Qx2fxw2gaa	you can call NOW if you want to.  call her and ask her how she's doing or something.  just make a date when you're SURE that you will bw able to attend.
zLzwaCpcaa	I think that the best thing to do is to message him, or better yet, talk to him. You can't let him go on thinking false things about you. You need to set him straight. Just be honest with him and let him know that your friends were behind it and if you are bold enough, I think that you should tell him you like him.|`|azsohISaaa	If he thought u was crazy he would of replied back to you or like came up to you in school. So like yeah I doubt he cares honestly ..
b38b773ea2ef060e0cacf85b66ca1e6daa	If a person feels tied down in a relationship, They are not in love.
rR5nIklWaa	you cant just put a age or date on it .  it just happens  i  was 14 when i fellin love  with my boyfreind  and am still  with him and now we are  having a baby and are so happy|`|KXs7Q4Xnaa	When you know you can trust the person involved.|`|Qx2fxw2gaa	there's not really a time. you'll just feel it.  sometimes when you're really young you will have crush DO NOT    be fooled it's not love. you'll know when you're mature enough.|`|QTlQWi7vaa	When you share and understand each other feelings
F2rI3Juaaa	I am in the same situation and had to shun my family. It didn't worry me that they ignored me (I was used to it) but my kids were getting confused. As soon as they targeted the kids - It was an easy decision.|`|pOsnTnimaa	i dont know what to say but i feel bad for you, <br>   <br>  focus on ur wife and kids and enjoy them.<br>  <br>  also dont shun ur parents, they are ur parents after all.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|CM1dfztQaa	This is a really sensative situation for all of you. It's never fair when your family treats you like an outsider, but you should be proud that you are able to stand on your own. You and your family would be happier and more secure within themselves if you weren't aroound people who are unaccepting.<br>  <br>  No one has the right to make your family feel uneasy. If they can't accept you and your family then they aren't worthy of your presence. Make holidays and special occations great for you and yours. Don't bother with those who choose to bring you down.|`|4W044a1uaa	no i have the exact same situation<br>  all it will do tho is make things awkward<br>  i feel the same way too
4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	Chick,    come on. if the guy doesn't wanna let tha world know bout yall two being together then he's the problem.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Uhm..    You being affectionate is a problem?  People know about "us" is a problem?  He doesn`t want to tell what kind of work he does?    What on earth is this guy hiding from you? What skeletons are in his closet?    Sorry - but to me it sounds like he is a fishy character.    If this were me - i would reconsider if this is a good relationship.  If my GF wanted to be affectionate in public - great.   That would mean she isn`t afraid to show the world - and i wouldn`t mind showing the world she is MY GF!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	my advice is stop messing around with a married man.|`|yy45iAbtaa	yup sounds like he has a girlfriend or is married waite until he calls you and meet him in a public place and ask him point blank if he is married if he is get the hell out of there as fast as you can.and move on that is the last thing you need they never leave there wives so don't think this guy is going to fall in love with you and leave his wife it will never happen.|`|h4kl18OOaa	He's married.  Let him go now.      Your joint behaviors was deplorable.  If you can't hold your liquor and behave in public, you need to stop drinking and keep your hands to yourself.  Same for him.    News of what was going on last night has probably already been relayed to his wife.      Your 'relationship' is over whether you want it to be or not.  He just wanted a 'little' diversion not a lifetime relationship.|`|xZslxv9qaa	to me it sounds like there is a reason he doesn't want ppl to no  have u been to his house?  i mean he wont even tell u what he does!  he may have something else goin on in his life  i have never heard of them not wanting to show affection in public  they are usually proud to show it off  but i dont no y he would say "now everyone will no bout u 2"  there is something fishy  i would ease up and do a little digging  with a innocent smile and a few bats of the eyes  if u no what i mean|`|JZjE1K9Baa	He is married!|`|A1iDPPOeaa	So he won't tell you what he does...  That's easy.  He's married.    Run, do not walk from this guy as quickly as you can, before he becomes a problem for you!|`|X7rPWJU8aa	sounds like he's hiding something like a gf or wife. just walk away before you get into more than you bargained for and more people get hurt|`|AA11967247	sounds like he's married. get a new guy.|`|7ko9czaaaa	i would find out more about this man.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	why do you want some one that does not want you,|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You are with the wrong person. He doesn't like you to be too affectionate in front if people  because everyone will "know about us'. He won't even answer a simple question like "where do you work? Sober up and you will see those are big red flags that you are involved with a married man, if you haven't already figured it out. You're on a slippery slope to heartache.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if someone loved u why would it matter if u showed them affection in public? isn't it what people do? isn't it normal? if he is being secretive and doesn't want people to know, the chances that he is a married man are great.your becoming a problem to him maybe because your expecting what everyone expects when they meet and fall in love with someone. he seems to only want u when its convenient to him. he is the problem not u, and u need to see this man for who he is. your now the problem because u have normal expectations, and its u who needs to cut ties and distance yourself for your own good. he is hiding something from u, and when they do this, they are either married or in another relationship, which can bring u only heartache.|`|oNb8RqTEaa	It sounds like he is married. Why would you want to hang with a guy who doesn't want your relationship discovered!?
zQ6bd8Z5aa	It's not about your drinking so much as your behavior in general. He's in a relationship and you've known it for a while. You may want more affection but he doesn't intend to end his other relationship - and even if he did what would you have? A guy who has no hesitation going out with someone on the side. Worse, he knows he can get away with it because you've done it with him yourself.    This is just about pathetic - you're setting up multiple accounts, answering your own questions under an alternate name, using the same posting style (repeating the same questions in multiple sections and very similar wording "I'm about to become a problem") all in the interests of what?! You need attention that badly? Go seek some help - these obsessive "relationships" of your are becoming a broken record.|`|zijJOEXqaa	dont do it|`|58df7376750b8ba74bc799eedbb69aa9aa	if he has told you he does'nt want people to know about you..I am guessing there is a reason.    Most likely one you do not want to hear or know about.    I would say, keep away. You can't force anyone into wanting more then they want.|`|BaPyqb1zaa	By Getting off yahoo answers.

The reason women in heels turn alot of men on is because it acentuates the female figure- we stand a little straighter, the **** and the breats stick out just a little bit more.|`|fDhOFwX9aa	No. Women in high heels look more confident and with the help of that high heels, the body lines and shapes look more attractive. So it is normal that u like women in high heels, but make sure you choose one of them only, pls.
EIY722Hwaa	The guilt trip. I have ran into this problem so many times with both my mom and step mom. Think of it this way, you're gonna still have your friend after the weekend too right? So it's the same thing. And sure you see your mom everyday, but she's feeling alone and wants to be with her daughter. Cut her some slack. And remember who's always there to catch you when you fall...your mom. :D Trust me. Stay with your mom. I mean come on...she's offering you dinner and shopping? How can you pass that up?|`|3I6hL9IAaa	yeah i think u should do what ur mom says its usually better|`|PZePfliGaa	spend time with your mom...my b/fs friend is in his 20s and just lost his mom...you can spend time with your friend another night...your mom is lonely...and to the f*c*k*n idiot below me...dont tell kids that...you know ppl do that these days...and if you are a mother...i feel sorry for you you're raising...|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Why not include your friend with shopping and dinner with your mom?  I'm sure your mom will buy dinner ( I'm a mom, I would ;) )  Then go spend the night at your friends.  win win situation.|`|cIYD9YqGaa	ur mommy doesnt want u growing up and leaving her :] <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220154704AAisqxj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	Spend time with your mom. You can spend the night another time with your friend. Someday you'll be gld you spent time with Mom. ASk you mom if it's ok if your friends tags along with you two for dinner. Mom will most likely say ok .That way she won't be alone either.|`|z4Pcc5fcaa	Kill her|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	go to dinner with your mom then sleep over at your friends house afterwards.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	Oh! you know what i think ?ure mom felt like having a mom-daughter thing since ure dad is not around,and she might really not feeling like spending the day alone.... she wants to spend a day with you!!!she wants to take you shopping and dinner,i think its soooo sweet!!Couldnt u reschedule ure friends thing for next week??ure dad's out of town,how long has it been since just the 2 of you spent time together??Of course she sees you every night,but what about that special mom-daughter thing?Thats really sweet alot of moms are either working,or dont value that kind of thing anymore...ure mom does,its speaks volumes about her.<br>  Oh the friend?you could reschedule and tell her something about ure mom not wanting to be alone since ure dad's out of town,she's gud friend,she'll understand:)
ku7s4H83aa	I wouldn't but to each his own.  He was honest and I guess that counts for something..at least for some people.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	I don't think that he wants to date you....    Well, to say something like that. It's a possibility, at any rate I think that you can do better ,and he really could use some time to himself, without distractions to heal , or medicate, or whatever.|`|Rb087BsAaa	only if you want to contract it yourself.|`|DlHfmzaiaa	it would really put me off|`|ztb7OCvyaa	If I had just met him, no, absolutely not. If we had been together for a while and I was already in love with him, maybe. But we would have to date for quite some time after he shared this information before having any kind of sexual relationship and I would have to be sure that there was trust and that this was indeed going to be a long term relationship. I also wouldn't ever have unprotected sex with him and I would expect him to be on top of his treatments. And, though I would appreciate his honesty it would probably still really put me off, and it would still be likely that I may not consider him at all.    I am not saying I would "discard" him. I'm just saying that my health is the most important thing to me.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I wouldn't put myself in a position in case I fell in love with that person, its a life long condition and you can catch it. FGS dont let him come anywhere near your girly bits for oral thats prob how he got it in the first place.|`|FMTuvujXaa	Nope! Are you nuts?  Come on, y do u want to trouble,trouble.  When trouble is not troubling you?    :-)
Z49UKxKDaa	Yeah, when my last ex broke up with me, I was crushed at first,  but I got over it as if nothing had happened. My most recent break up with my most recent boyfriend.. it crushed my heart. I would had rather dealt with my first break up 10 times over again than even one time with my current ex. I still do and probably will always have feelings for him.

s8gLMXHxaa	try just talking to him. maybe not directly, but see if you can talk in privvate or something. he might think he really likes you and may just  not be able to handle a relationship in his life rite now. just try talking to him in a nonintimidating, noncommitical way.|`|tEG6m4zEaa	give him a chance or at least get to know him
MxjLiFm0aa	obviously your getting pretty confused..<br>  and thats totally normal!<br>  if you have any secconed guesses about this guy..<br>  GET TO KNOW HIM MORE!!!<br>  nothings wrong with being friends first.|`|5XERNFogaa	Well, there's definitely some sort of attraction there. I'd try to get to know him better first, just for the sake of it. If it turns out that conjures up more feelings, then good. But if then you're just kinda apathetic, then I wouldn't bother with him anymore. But hey, at least you got to know the kid, right? <br>  <br>  If the opportunity arises to date him, you should probably go for it. I mean, you're young, and you semi like him, and heck, why not? If it works, it works. If it doesn't it doesn't. And if you end up breaking up, it doesn't appear you see him often enough for it to get awkward. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Av6rDfjKaa	well, i would say get to know him. you know what people are like until you really get to know him. then if it doent work, or youre not attracted to him, thats that. but maybe it could be something very good, or maybe you will find a good friend in the process. its worth a shot. what do you have to lose?|`|qDII8luraa	Yeah, perfectly normal. Like you don't know if it can last? Well, I say if you both like eachother, give a chance, what is the worst that can happen? But, if you have a very bad feeling about him, then you know what is best.|`|AA10410277	it's normal i feel like dat sometimes too.|`|YTYrg3qlaa	go on a date w him and see what you think after :)|`|ecab2985a2d136d03ff8f4eaaf1540e0aa	lol, you just need to get to know him better, yes it's normal for girls to get this way about guys, I know i have so many times I don't even bother counting, for me, it's normal because it depends on what the guy does, like if he pisses me off, I don't want to talk to him for the rest of the week or ever again, yet I still like him. That feeling that something is missing, well maybe something is, maybe he's missing something that you adore about guys. My advice, get to know him better :)|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	If your a teen it's normal.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	Thats normal. Apperentally though he is not the one for you; <br>  So you can give it a try, but if there aren't any feelings there, <br>  then i would break it off.

Fnsea1sMaa	aww yeh that does sound romantic to me  i think he's not using you  he just doesnt want to hurt you again if you were in a relationship|`|lcjMqzh9aa	personal opinion is that if he loved him surely he would want to be with you like girlfriend and boyfriend. To me it sounds like he just wants the benefits of a relationship without having to be in one, that way when things get tough he canr run away easily like hes obv done before 'hurting u was the hardest thing ive ever done'  Im not denying u like each other coz u clearly do and yes the snow thing was romantic, it just seems a shame that if u get on that well that ur not together. U say ur not together coz of the arguments but surely all couples argue and thats what makes u stronger as a couple, at the moment ur own there for each other when things are easy and everythings happy, whats gonna happen when things get tough and hard times happen.  Just my opinion tho =D hope it goes ok for you, you clealy really like this boy, dont let him hurt you again x|`|m6LQkIrjaa	i think this is romantic but u have to be careful because guys can play a role of still loving u only to break ur heart  again. im not sayin he will do that but this is wut happens. he sounds like a nice guy and i think u guys should keep doin wut ur doin and don't let other people tell u that u can't still love him. u can and this is just the stage of still loving each other and tryin to work things out with ur relationship and work on just stayin how u guys are!|`|X7rPWJU8aa	sounds like he is playing you. even though the the story has a romantic feel to it
AA10388823	I know exactly how you feel. Believe me. But unless your mom wants a divorce, there's very little you could do. You could perhaps go off to college and move on with your life.

kCv798F9aa	I find that personally my feelings do change very often like that. It might even happen the very next day.

If something gets predictable, always the same thing happening, it gets boring. Then we want a change. So, he probably was feeling this way for a while, but didn't have any better opportunities. So he stays with you because he would rather be bored with the relationship than be alone. So, he meets another girl who is interested in him and there is his opportunity. He gets a change and isn't alone!|`|AA11783902	I think it could happen.|`|l6tENYGLaa	i would say no...its not that easy...if he's saying this and being truthful...sorry, but it wasn't love to begin with just lust, which can be switched on and off like a switch...if he truely loved u...then he wouldn't be able to just shut that off...which also could explain why he is so interested in someone else so quick...sorry...but thats not love...u don't get over anyone that quick...good luck....hope this helps....|`|uSUMwINgaa	It is likely that he was not feeling love, maybe lust|`|sGhJZTYdaa	Its possible. I only say that cause while you guys were still in a relationship his feeling for you probrolly wasn't there anymore. Or he had his sights on her already... You said like. So it could just be lust.

WDs4fRoxaa	This is a tough situation to be in.    Being in a relationship where one party puts forth no effort  until they know that the other party is declaring that the   relationship is over.    Then he decides he will halfheartedly attempt to contribute.    I would assume that once the relationship got to the point  where both parties said that it was over...that you had already  exhausted yourself with attempts to point out how he does not  contribute financially, emotionally, or physically.    He even went as far as to agree that it is over, and then when   you take the next logical step and give the building notice, he  gets his feelings hurt.    It does not matter what led to him being so stubborn, what matters  is that what he wants so badly right now...was not worth the fight  before you put in the notice.    People are always talking about how their dysfunctional upbringing  has tainted their thought process.    They can repeat the same mistakes they learned, or teach themselves  to live a different way.    He could have easily went and got a job, started helping with the child,  and then treating you like he wanted to be in this relationship.    He did not have to admit defeat. He did not even have to say a word.    He could have used actions to say everything he needed to say.    You have to be strong. This is not about you being the bad guy.    This is about him not being the man he needs to be for that child.    If he wants to win your heart back...actions speak louder than the two of you could ever scream.    Best wishes|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Ok, this is going to be blunt and right to the point.  A lot of people wonder why in today's world 50% of all marriages fail.  It is because of a lack of communication.  I do not here a hole lot of communication being done as a couple in this relationship which would explain why it failed.  Both of you need to talk about your differences.  Not the kind of talking where you stand by the doorway before you leave to go to work kind of talk.  But I mean talk privately on your couch or in the bedroom where you can both express your concerns openly with the concern you both want to show.  By the sounds of it, he does care, he wants to try, but he may need a little help.  I know, you are probably saying that he should not need to be shown for help.  Well, that is another reason why marriages fail and sincere relationships like yours fail, because you do may not be helping each other.  Maybe he was raised in a family where he did not have to do a lot of things for himself.  A lot of how we act now days is stemmed from our childhood.  Talk with him, come to some common grounds and work this out.  I know I likely wont get the 10 points for this, but I am sorry, it sickens me knowing that 50% of all marriages fail, and being on here for a few months now, it is all the same thing, lack of communication and being open to each other.  Rather than point out all the bad things as you said you are doing, think of the positive things you have together.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|atzw0IP4aa	re read your lease to see if there is an out. Maybe you can move out and change the lease to his name. See what your rights are. Good luck.

Is it even possible?|`|YyFexhd3aa	attraction is not by choice ........so either he like you or not if not there is nothing that you can do actually so just ask him again and see what he have to say|`|abxdXqRhaa	you need to spell shiiiiit right.|`|tWUElJGOaa	hmmmm,....sounds to me u should really get to know this guy by finding out what he liked to do and maybe helping or participating in his interest where you two will have something in common. thats a start seems to me like you may be putting a little too much effort into something that was never meant to be. but people do change but they must want to change in the first place, good luck
mzHTfCG4aa	he might be mad because no boy wants to hear that his girlfriend did something wrong.. butt i think he also might be jealous at the same time because its actually bothering him..|`|gjtdLPIYaa	and i think your one sentence does not make sense|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	???what things does he tell him???<br>  i cant give you a proper answer until you tell me.|`|NZK8uk13aa	Well, when people are jealous it is being mad.

TShsb3EXaa	Dawg, you seriously would reduce yourself to meeting someone on that. I know they sometimes work and that you can find the 'one' on that but get out and have some fun. Actually meet people!|`|xItSR9Z7aa	If you're looking for old friends/lovers etc...  this website is good:    http://everestclimb.ws    Good luck|`|ZulFhMdIaa	gayda.com
cYf5IacRaa	He was probably trying to impress them, not snub you. But, if you're really concerned, I would talk to him about it and ask what his deal is. Also, if you've liked him for six years, and you're really good friends, then you should just let him know how you feel. There's no point in bottling it up. Good luck! :)
KEIQix4Maa	Don't just blurt it out like that to her.  Engage in casual conversation and when the topic of Dating comes out discreetly tell her you are jaded with the whole dating thing and would prefer a NSA ( no strings attached ) relationship or a friends with benefits thing.  It is quite possible she may also want a similar situation.  Good Luck|`|HYBdxFbZaa	It can be perceived as sexual harassment. My suggestion would be to not even say anything to her unless y'all are close friends and see if maybe a "friends with benefit" relationship can be arranged but do it OUTSIDE OF WORK. Its not about how you meant it, its how she perceives it that matters. <br>  <br>  If all you are wanting is "not strings attached" sex or "friends with benefits" relationship then you might try looking outside of the work place. It can and eventually will get very complicated. |`|frAoKiA2aa	be straight foward and to the point  if you only want to have sex with her dont try to be her boyfriend keep it straight but while ur with her treat her like a lady even though ur only **** buddies
oDLdqrJfaa	Well im acctually a human being not a pig so......****, face, ***, hair, small waist, pretty eyes, white teeth.|`|RaLiLTT9aa	I like her to have a sense of humor, but not be judgemental, and a guy can really be his true self around her, and she won't make fun of him for everything. Plus, I would want her to be attractive, and rather sexy.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	funny <br>  can take a joke <br>  likes to be with hme <br>  likes me for who i am<br>  quite pretty (but im not to bothered about looks :D
2N5qCHKDaa	it kinda means that you have said something or did something that reminded her of something or someone. i get called that all the time and it means that something i did made my frineds think of something else, it is not a bad thing it just can get slightly annoying, so if i were you just brush it off and let it go or tell your friends that you dont like being called that
Hp18CSwLaa	you, and not her friend, are in the relationship. If it's you, then it's you. You shouldn't stop that for anyone, especially not for her friend.<br>  <br>  If she has a problem with who you are and how you do things,then she should talk to you about it herself. If she can't or won't, that might show a lack of openness and willingness to communicate. You can't have a relationship without good communication. Imagine if that becomes a recurring theme in your relationship--that whenever she has a problem, you have to find out through someone else.<br>  <br>  the friend could be jealous, or simply protective or something like that. Either way, it's really none of her business how you and your girl do things.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Talk to her directly, tell her what her friend said , tell her that you don't want her to feel smothered and if the text and all are too much for her that you are okay with slowing down.  She may not have said anything and her friend is just jealous of the attention that you give her. You are right if you just change your way she may feel there is something wrong from your side if her friend is just causing trouble|`|0KLu4hRaaa	The friend could be right or the friend could be trying to cause problems. Ask the lady you are dating if you are crowding her without telling her that her friend said you were. No need to stir up high school dramas--just ask and then you will know. No harm -- no foul.|`|ZnbkUNPaaa	thats just today's women man, they're so effin anoying sometimes, you can do something romantic for her that she wont forget, even if she doesnt like it. the important thing is that she doesnt forget it and that your remebered for it|`|THAMJdQyaa	If you want a MATURE and REASONABLE ADULTS opinion don't just text her all the time.  Try calling her or doing something different.  If you feel you need to no, why don't you just ask her to her face and not via text.|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	Cool it a little.Let her go to you.Sometimes, once the chase is over the fun stops. Let her go to you .I don't mean lose contact, but let her text you. See how it goes from there|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	yeah she probably did say something to a friend, but she just wants you to chill for a bit.<br>  people need their space. you dont have to stop talking/communicating with her all together , it just means you shouldnt talk to her every single second of the day.<br>  <br>  dont change entirely<br>  keep your personality, just becoem less 'attached"<br>  so you can still start up conversations by text just only do it once every other day and let her text you first<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|Q5BM2POnaa	I think the following:<br>  <br>  1. If her friend warned you, they have DEFINITELY TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU SMOTHER HER.<br>  <br>  2. Always leave them wanting more, not less<br>  <br>  3. If you pull back, if the relationship has a future, it will not cause her to lose interest, and may in fact, cause her to move closer.<br>  <br>  Having said all that, I hate games, nor do you want to get to a point where you're just sitting around waiting for her to call or text.  It sounds to me like perhaps you don't have enough friends, interests or hobbies outside or her, or at least you don't have as many as she does.<br>  <br>  Cultivate more of that, do things with other people (not sexually) and find interesting things to do.  At the very least it will give you more to talk about when you are with her, and it may also cause her to want to be more a part of it.<br>  <br>  The good news is she likes you enough to give you this hint.  If you didn't mean anything to her she would just call it off and not waste time communicating indirectly through her friend.|`|Bd47h6Ovaa	I woundnt make drasitic changes. Just ease off a little. Thats a little weird that her friend said something. Maybe thats what the last guy did|`|c5UAa65qaa	You're absolutely right that communication is critical.  Which is why you shouldn't go by secondhand advice from her friend.  Ask her if she'd like you to dial back on the texting a bit, and make it clear that you're willing to do whatever will make her feel comfortable.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	well how often are you texting her? anything more than twice a week is too much.|`|neuprBeGaa	If it was just something her friend said, I'd tell you to ignore it.  But since you think it came from the lady herself, I suggest that you reduce the frequency of your contacts, but increase their warmth - make the texts a little longer and a sweeter...just a little less often.<br>  <br>  Try that for awhile and see how she reacts.  If she asks about the reduced frequency, then tell her - "I didn't want to be too pushy and make you bored with me."|`|wYrS24e2aa	hold up did her friend tell you this or was it the girl? did it look like the girl showed signs of this? I'm not sure how good you are at reading/sensing people. But if everything is going well dont change a thing. But if you your self start sensing like she is getting annoyed with your constant texts then you should turn it down a bit. And give her some space, show her you have a life too.|`|IQ3pERJOaa	Okay. you dont want to come off as annoying. so give her some space. but like 3 out of the 7 days text her and just be like hey. whats up? and stuff. you never want ot be clingly or distante but also you need to keep your distance if she is going to be like that. <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Always just be yourself and do what feels right.  If you end up changing who you are and how you act it ends up turning worse in the long run.  If she doesn't like what you do or how you do things it's not meant to be then either.

But, if you took away the height, I'd rather go out with Guy A, because Guy B doesn't seem very nice. It's rude to tell someone they're fat, even if they're just teasing. Also I wouldn't like the fact that Guy B likes to get in fights. And the reason Guy B would stare would be because he'd be checking me out, which I wouldn't like if I didn't like him. I like Guy A a little because I'm a sucker for bad boys (lol) and I like it when guys flirt with me :D That's just my opinion, but of course you have a different opinion than me, so for you, I would say pick any guy you like because it's your life! I hope it works out with any guy you choose! Take care, -Maddy :)|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I would go with Guy A. You said Guy B stares at you, and it seems like a physical attraction.

IkWcwsj8aa	yes obviously...|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	Depends on what culture you're from.|`|bec16h7Taa	These people answering don't get it. Its not like you're having sex with him. You just like him. I think that's normal. However, you need to tell yourself that you can only like him as a friend. A relationship beyond that cannot happen. Look for another guy. Then you won't be so interested in your cousin anymore.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Far from normal.    Have you ever seen Deliverance?|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	okay, well  if they're only your cousin because of a marriage between your relatives.  then it's just like saying you like your "uncle in law's son" which is acceptable.  if they're related to you in blood.  that's incest.  xx|`|rmLUe0JRaa	not normal eww gross!|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	That's not normal.|`|Lt9VAJdGaa	uhm. maybe if you think he's cute. but other than that...no.|`|gBAstki5aa	i would leave the country.  and then go into a gas chamber.|`|Cvlf7arlaa	dont act on it. i dont find that normal by the way.|`|tWUElJGOaa	you must live in alabama or something, dont forget thats how Texas Chainsaw Massacre came around....|`|dgbC5Shkaa	egnore everyone that says its not normal!!     Of course its normal.    No one can help their feelings for other people.    Dont start anything with him though.     But dont worry, Its not your fault you like him, Its fine. :)     He's just another human. Theres nothing wrong with liking him.    Take care xx|`|fDhOFwX9aa	You like ur cousin, is normal. But u cannot in love with him.

If you want e mail me and i can explain what i did to stop those feelings.|`|HwBtMug1aa	no its not........    but u can like him as long as u dont date or anything like that cuz thats illegal    unless its ur 2nd cuz|`|krRUjGcDaa	It's normal actually,i fall for my cuzins all the time, but after awhile i found out that those are just phases,you'lll get over it by the end of the day.     It is normal,i think every 7 out of 10 people must have like they're own cousin..But it's forbidden honey.. *sigh*|`|3WCONjyfaa	No that is super far from not normal|`|K8j8MRGwaa	ARE YALL IMIDEATE FAMILY!!! IF SO THAN UEAH ITS PRETTY SICK BUT IF NOT I ADVISE YOU TO PUT OUT|`|765QsPYZaa	haha that seems like a problem. you shouldn't like your cousin.|`|IPMr6zEJaa	For a young teenager becoming attracted to one's cousin is quite normal. In the first 20 or so years of your life you go through 5 psychological cycles. One of them is the sexual phase, in which you begin to like boys/girls. Once the phase has ended you're never attracted to your sister/parents/ect. However, people such as cousins, are very similiar in personality to yourself. You are not around them during the sexual phase, therefor you never.... well whatever its comp-licated    yea its normal, you'll get over it soon.
a3kjC49Baa	Discuss with him your issue with the age gap. Don't do anything rash. There is never any promises or certainties in life that a relationship will last anyway.  My nan was with my pa for over 30  years .. and she was 10 years older. She could no longer have any more kids and already had 5 of her own. The lesson here, is if it is love it will work itself out. :)|`|AIr5mQ7aaa	If he loves u he will understand... talk to him and be sincere|`|X9vsoxB2aa	It's not a such a big deal the older you get. If you're like 28 and he's 18, it could potentially be a deal breaker. But it's at least "Socially Accepted" if you were maybe 38, and him 28 or something similar. If you guys are getting serious, talk to him about it and see how he feels. If it doesn't bother him, go for it. You only live once :)
oUDDsVu5aa	if your a guy or a girl the best gift I have ever  given was a hand written poem and letter telling that person how you feel and what you value the most about them from the heart along with a rose for every day or week or month you have been together and if your like me and you have been together for 20 plus years with that person then count each petal on each rose and use the petals to represent each day or week or month to make it more affordable that is what I did and she loved it with all her heart.And I stated it in the poem about the roses and what they represent and how much they mean to me.  best of luck|`|FPGqq2Tcaa	if your a guy...then..flowers, a heart-shaped box of chocolates and a note which says " i luv you more den anyone!

Go for it!!|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	ok she said you can't tell him its a dare but she didn't say you couldn't write him and tell him it was a dare.|`|U2XCZHilaa	tell him you were asked to do so after the dare. you didn't break any rules right? because it's after the dare.|`|rmLUe0JRaa	i dont see a loop hole!|`|edaf5d2064f28d318ed6f3e11e8b141caa	Loophole: No restriction about sending a note to set the tone of the candygram.     For example, if you didn't like the guy you could write, "There's nothing sweet about you so I thought you might need these."    In this case, you don't seem to want to be honest about "kinda" liking this guy so you might want to send a note stating something to the affect of, "I try to do something nice at least once a day, this covers me for today (or you could write: "the week")" ... or "I heard your mom is nice, give this to her".|`|VPsVyI6Daa	Worst case scenario, he wont be into it. Best case, you'll hook up! And you would like that!|`|V7jRP00yaa	nope, no loop holes, got to grin and bear it|`|Lt9VAJdGaa	Suck it up and send it. Geez. When he finds out you like him, and he likes you, and you get married.. you'll look back on this and laugh :]|`|iaoOx4xjaa	Why are you looking for a loop hole, sounds like you have the perfect reason to send someone you liek something nice, go for it and who knows what you will get back!|`|K8j8MRGwaa	if your are hot its good but if not dont do it|`|Qx2fxw2gaa	oh im sorry none what so ever!

And if really wish for your happiness then he must support you in any way possible. Love doesn't give someone the authority to prison the other,..Remember you are are still the ruler of your very own life. (o)o)...hoping for the best for you.|`|Rb087BsAaa	why are you wasting your time with him?

domEftoIaa	personally i think its just sad that people do that. just because they have something wrong with them doesn't mean they won't be a good friend. people just need to grow up. i bet they wouldn't like it if the shoe was on the other foot.
tYO2Ir1oaa	Please go to the cinema with the nice guy and forget the loser that's not treating u right. Sure, he's got a stressful job but why is he giving his number to another girl? I think it's down to the popular phrase, "he's just not that into you". Go with the other guy!!
WNuRV0A7aa	dont know about the chocolat paint but how bout chocolate sauce. you can get it from any confectionery shop.|`|l5NzJZ6Zaa	dint get u                 u mean chocolate colour or chocolate only
xnyl9Yf6aa	Personally, i think you should start talking to him as if you keep it quiet you are going to get even more annoyed and will start feeling upset. just start to talk to him if you see him on his own someday, even if its just a simple 'hey' it will work, and carry it on from there. (: x|`|f7sKYoqcaa	try talking to him again and see what happens...|`|TAMGy07Daa	ask him out to the movies!!
qDDz5GFnaa	I have been in this situation before, You both like the same guy and then it turns out he doesn't like either of you but he likes your other friend.   I'm not saying this will happen to you but, you will have to make an agreement with your friend. Otherwise things could go majorly wrong. You should talk to her about why you both like him, and who would deserve him more?   You could also just wait and see what happens. Tell your friend, if he asks her, to say yes. You should be happy shes got the guy she wants. And if he asks you, you should be able to say yes knowing your friend has agreed to it.  Or you could just leave him, if u both can't agree over a boy, you might not be great Friends after all, or he might not be worth it.    Good Luck :D|`|91ca82de9e31e75dc359de11826647adaa	Well a guy isn't worth ruining your friendship over. Talk to her about it and figure out how you both feel if he liked the other one.|`|s63U2ccFaa	I think you should ask him,it doesn't matter about your best friend because if he doesn't like your best friend than that's his choice. If she falls out with you over it then she can't be a very good friend to you. :)

Brides who choose goth weddings spend many, many hours perfecting the image they want for their wedding - clearly they respect the ceremony, but prefer something non-traditional in costume.

JYgJD0Rwaa	You would have to contact your local court house to see about your specific state laws because there are some states that will not allow a woman to divorce if she is pregnant. If so, then you will have to wait to file the divorce until after the baby is born.<br>  Its not likely your ex will win full custody, especially if you point out his "lack of fathering skills/actions".

I'd wait.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Do NOT have a child until your divorce is final.<br>  Do not get pregnant during that time.<br>  <br>  In some states, that child will be viewed as your spouse's---and he can mess with you for the rest of your life with it.|`|AA10065812	*** According to your question history, you have two small children, so whose the father of the other one, or is that what caused the divorce?<br>  <br>  Depending on your state, yes it could, but I'm more concerned about you slanted comment about the father getting custody.<br>  <br>  "My ex-husband and I have one daughter together and he is fighting for custody so he doesn't have to pay child support."<br>  <br>  Just who do you think is going to support the child if he does win custody, or do you expect her to starve?<br>  <br>  His attorney would have informed him that less than 15% of non-custodial mothers get ordered to pay child support, of which only 5% ever pay it.

w0ZqjJBtaa	You are clearly NOT over it. If you were, you wouldn't be thinking of ways to get back at him. Focus your energy on what you have now. If I was your partner; I'd be wandering why you're still so bothered about the ex. Revenge is over-rated. All it proves; is how much you DO STILL CARE.

A little boy.  Chasing little girls. Just look forward and don't worry about the  lease. Talk to your landlord and then talk to the LORD OF ALL.  He is making a way for you.

I hope your husband is no longer 'mentoring'.  He lacks boundaries and being in the position of influence with women is just to tempting for him.  He has problems.  The church leaders should be aware he was crossing the line with a female.  It's never a good idea to have a male 'mentoring' alone with a female anyway.  Don't they have women who can teach?   Many a preacher has fallen to the temptation when placed in a position of having women looking up to him and going to him for their 'problems'.   I suggest you look into a book, "Torn Asunder" by D. Carder.   Once you have yourself prepared, don't protect him any longer.  He needs to have consequences, he needs to face his inappropriate actions.  It might be the wake up call he needs to get himself straightened out.      Gather your evidence and financial records.  Get a consultation with an attorney before you do anything.  Find out what you need to do to protect your rights, your shared assets.   Don't expect him to play 'nice'.  Put records of your evidence in a safe place outside your home.     Try to take care of yourself.  Withdraw yourself from his drama.  Try to eat, even if it is only small frequent snacks.  Do somethings you enjoy, treat yourself.  Just take things one day at a time.  You will survive this, with or without your husband.   A support group of those dealing with infidelity will be helpful.     In the mean time, tell your husband to join the following group for men struggling with sexual temptations.      http://www.everymansbattle.com/home.asp
0zdHykkSaa	definitely wait a little longer to be married. he doesn't sound ready. he doesn't sound like he loves you so much if he's so worried what you look like. when someone really loves you, they tend to not care what you look like because they are in love with YOU, not your looks. hold off on getting married, have your surgery because it's important for you, and if he still wants to be with you in a year or two when your losing all the weight-maybe it will make him realize how much he loves you, or how much he doesn't. either way, after you have the surgery if he is unsure about you, dump him and find someone that is 100% sure that they love you. good luck~    add: he could be insecure but that's no excuse. this is still a surgery and you need his love and support. if he is overweight as well, maybe he is afraid of you being thinner than him if you aren't already? maybe he just doesn't like change, but most of all, he should be happy that you are being proactive about your health and for your future. that's what I don't understand about this guy. it doesn't sound right.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I've known two women who went through this procedure. In both cases their husbands were not supportive early on because they were afraid they would no longer be "worthy" of their women. These ladies had the procedures and their husbands came to love it. Sadly however, in both cases the ladies gained back almost all the weight. You've got to continue the lifestyle. Good luck to you.|`|d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	It may be that he really is worried that he won't be attracted to you anymore, but there are other possible explanations.    Maybe he's afraid for your wellbeing.  You're healthy now and he doesn't want you to have surgery.    He could also be afraid that it will make you more attractive and that you'll be out of his league.  He doesn't want to lose you.    He could also be saying this because he wants to reassure you that he loves you the way you are and that he doesn't want you to do this for him.
wkNvFMLGaa	my boyfriend went through this kind of ''crisis'' as well, blaming it on work...we almost broke up but he realised what he would loose. maybe try and text him less, e mail him less, you will see he will start panicking himself|`|PaNqxZRtaa	Just because you don't text like he used to doesn't mean that he does not love you. Maybe something did happened at work and he feels stressed and texting maybe is not one of he priorities on his list. At least he texts you one time is not like he doesn't at all. Trust the guy. If you break up with him because he does not text you no more that maybe you don't like him at all. Don't make texting or e-mailing a habit because now see what happens. Trust you bf ok|`|SiOjEH00aa	errr, no, how about try and help him out/|`|RoTLnFGZaa	well, i mean, maybe you should try to spend actual time with him.  maybe, he's serious & can't text you constantly.|`|3VJTtgRvaa	No. I think you should just try to spend more time with him.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	no text him more now!|`|627pWyVkaa	Try and give him a call after hes done work and see how his day went and show you care and maybe tell him you miss him see what he says and if he doesnt appreciate it then maybe you should reevaluate what you are getting out this relationship.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	He still contacts you every day, so what are you complaining about? Most guys are not the sort to just sit around and send texts all day. Especially if he's busy. My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I get maybe one text from him every couple of months. Other than that we just focus on talking. Texting really isn't something to get upset about.|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	trust him.....|`|feNHKUtVaa	...WOW trust him or burn|`|7e8NN8saaa	Give him the benefit of the doubt - something so small should not be what breaks a relationship.|`|qLaw1VELaa	u shud try pulling his one eyed trouserd trout|`|vDjy1eKDaa	thats not a very good attitude!

IF that's what your relationship is based on, hun, you don't have one. A man has a right to actually pay attention to his job.    He's better off without you if you can't accept that!
wohGR1Nkaa	This guy was acting with his penis. And not with his brain.   If he had realised that sex means kids then he should have thought about it :D  Tell him he should pay for his actions and that he should not be an ***. His penis got you into it and that you dont need him to go on.   If they further harass you then call the police sweetie.  :D    And congrats!|`|1sHBVWuKaa	ur with a ducher|`|ngoeL5Rpaa	Leave him forget it|`|0CHoZRk3aa	you need to learn some grammer city *****|`|9jr5QaE5aa	atleist he didnt tell u to get a life  he is so nt bad|`|odQewFgvaa	Well first if he is truly doing bigger and better things he wouldn't be calling you, now would he.  It doesn't sound like that ex is going to be doing anything bigger or better. So don't worry about him. Most guys are not like that.  If you found someone else then you should at least give him the benefit of the doubt unless he does something. Don't let how your ex treated you damage your future relationships.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Why would he not be like your ex if he got you pregnant? Make sure you file for child support. He and his messed up girlfriend would be doing you a favor by leaving you alone. Just make him pay monthly for many years.|`|wE2etBzbaa	that's why people like you should learn how to use a condom, you should've asked  people who do you and they are not married with you or not in a long term relationship with you to put a condom  unless you plan to have a baby.   planned parenthood, not just random jungle act please|`|2Nu3sgZ2aa	if i was pregnant by my bf, i would think that something incredibly scary was going on.|`|ZulFhMdIaa	Let me guess, you are still a teenager?|`|d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	Kick him out of your life.  Don't let him have any contact with you or the child (if you choose to keep it).    Go after as much child support money as you can get.  It is your legal right.  It is also your duty to do it to support your child.|`|wkNvFMLGaa	are you pregnant with him? well, just think about it. i'm not saying to go for an abortion but i wouldn't stay with him either. liar!
dSMb8JDvaa	Both have to go to Court but normally most I have seen the custody always go to the mother and the man has to pay for the Child Support.|`|SsfnitjXaa	If the father wishes to take the girls then they will award them to him.  He should still bring them over to visit the mom's side of the family, especially since they have bonded with the children.      Kids can never have too many people to love them.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Why do people put themselves in these situations?     Time for the lawyers.............|`|eIVy7xkXaa	this is a tricky legal situation.  ask lawyer.|`|W0KQTXrvaa	the father has every right if the mom isn't living in the same state|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Custody should go with the woman, no self respecting bachelor would want to be saddled with a child.|`|kbIkVS0raa	They are his kids too and if he is willing to take them then he has every right. Your mother can get visitation while your sister is away but that is about all she will get. I am sorry but if you sister left her kids for a job a judge will not favor her in court. I hope the father gets his girls if he is willing then good for him. I can't imagine any job offer being worth me leaving my kids but I guess everyone is different|`|AA11436163	If the dad is willing to take custody of them while the mom is away then he should.|`|7e8NN8saaa	They are his children too - if your sister does not have custody then legally he is more entitled to custody than your mother.     If he didn't want custody and your sister legally turned custody of the children over to your mother then - yes your mother could collect the child support. But if he wants custody of his children and your sister has in effect abandoned them - he will probably get custody.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Lina,  I would recommend consulting an attorney to answer any legal matters but on a personal note, I would let your sisters boyfriend have the kids.   If your sister decided to leave her children and take a job abroad instead of taking a job where she could be with her children on a regular basis then in my opinion she gave up the rights to her children.   Your sister is not a mother...who can be there for them and this business of shoveling the kids from the ex to the your parents is a bit old.   It is time for someone to step up to the plate and give these children some stability.   If your sister wants to see her children she can visit them when she has time...just like she has been doing anyway.  The children should not be shuffled around just because the adults cannot seem to get their act together.   It seems to me that your sisters ex bf is trying to give his children the life that they deserve.   I say let him and the rest of the family should not get in the middle of it.   If your sister wants custody of her children let her deal with it but it does not appear to be a priority in her life.   Let this go and remain friends with the ex bf so that you guys can still be part of the lives of the children.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	What your problem ? Kids are with the father . You go ahead make your life .|`|IcH5gMICaa	They both sound irresponsible with kids to me.  Maybe they are good parents, but honestly just because of a job is no reason to leave your kids with someone who isn't stable.  And just because your "mother in law" says she'll take care of them doesn't mean she will.  And if he's always allowing them to get sick etc., then he doesn't need to handle this on his own.  Your sister needs to find a job where kids aren't going to work against her and she can be in charge.  She also needs to get rid of the loser with the PS4.|`|zRkTwsawaa	Am confused because it seems the girl in question is not legally married for if she is, there won't be any complication. She and the father of her children does not have any concrete agreement but I can only say that if my mother is Mrs. Angel Heaven, then my father is Heaven.

Read his word and he will lighten your load. You are struggling and seeking answers. This is normal, but it's where you seek and get the answers that matter.

So many people think that they're ugly or they're pretty. I think you're not to decide what you look like because you're actually worried about what the other person thinks. So, leave that for the others. Just maintain your sanity. Killing yourself is not the answer, it never is. Quitting is an ugly thing and you don't want to do that on your life or Mom. How would you ever find out if someone can love you and stuff if you kill yourself. You're better than death and you don't want that to get to you. Do something for the world. Go help children read or find volunteer jobs that help you see how much people do in fact need you in this world. You can make a difference. If you still want to give up on yourself at least think of how much worse your life can be. Go speak to a homeless person or someone whose in a worse situation, I'm sure that after that you'll feel better about your own life and it may give you the initiative to help someone else out. Good luck and live life! =)|`|nlQiRHRJaa	OH NO DONT GIVE UP .you said it yourself your mom needs you  anything in life have answers ,dont focus on the probleme ,focus on the solution, yes i know it's easy for me to say ,i cant tell you what to do ,but the only thing i can tell you is life is all you got keep up with your fight try all you can to make the best of it ,i was told not to long ago that i had multiple sclerosis and i was going to be in a wheel chair   soon ,well like you i was sad and depressed ,but i just told myself to keep fighting no matter what! so please take care of yourself and your mom ,and if you need to talk let me know .  god bless you
tWUElJGOaa	im not joyce brothers but from a guys point of view he may be taking care of business elsewhere, seriously. just how well do u know him. any gay that refrains from male/female sex is either gay or getting taken care of somewhere else. you may want to have a 1 on 1 conversation with this guy to see if he's wasting your time.|`|LmHAItfgaa	hes a fool but speak to him tell him how you feel if you bottle it up you'll hate yourself go depressed and explode say the wrong thing cause arguments and mistrust and then he leaves..    so to avoid all the above tell him how your feel and you want to know how he feels or were he stands on the subject..    but dont speak to him like hes on trial hold his hand and talk honestly he may be feeling depressed work, family, or medicial problem?|`|ZKw46efXaa	i think you need to confront him about this!!! i would have said there might be another girl but you said you are 99% sure he isnt cheating and you know him better than i do!!!!

Do you feel there is still a connection there ,on both sides?  Do you still feel the same or are you hoping it will work as you feel a little insecure?  You are probably also doubting your chances of finding happiness with someone else .    To be honest my first girlfriend and me were like bunnies for the first 10 months or so ,most teenagers are the first time they can have sex pretty much whenever they want especially after the years of fumblings and knockbacks.    In the end the novelty wears off and you are left with your actual relationship which is often were the problems start.  I'm going to be totally honest here ,I just got bored of sex with her and the more she needed affection I just felt trapped .  She even told me when  to give her attention and told me to tell her I loved her.  I should have ended it but childish insecurities held me back too.    If this relationship isn't working then you need a break .  A  lot of young men stay with a girlfriend because they would find it hard seeing them with someone else,sad but true.    You need to find someone who you can have a full equal relationship with.  It was stressful but my second serious relationship was so much better as I'd learnt a lot from the first.  Have a proper think if you actually feel the same way then make some decisions , put yourself first and give yourself some value.

mK4vT8mZaa	omg you poor thing!!!! you must be so worried.    i think there's a possibilty you've definitely been scammed.    but dont forget that you've been with him for 2 years, he might be in some kind of trouble and he's trying to reach you.    when you see him again, give him a chance though. unexplainable things happen.|`|ku7s4H83aa	Sounds like it.  Do not try to call him.  He will wonder why you have not and will call back.  His money will run out and come back for more.  I would tell him that if he doesn't pay you back you will file it against him in small claims court.  That just might work..watch Judge Judy for more expert tips! Good luck and don't give him anymore woman!  It's YOUR money, not his.|`|72UNDrwkaa	yes i'm afraid it sounds like you have been scammed big time, hopefully you will learn from this big mistake|`|ddP3klT3aa	Yes you have. Never ever loan a substantial amount of money to ANY ONE, especially a boyfriend, without a written contract. I wouldn't loan money period.|`|EVZtirRuaa	C'mon he is your boyfriend of 2 years! 2 years is quite a long time!! Wheres all the Trust and Compassion!!? Don't you think you should give him some benifit of doubt? With this level of Trust, I wonder how you consider him as your boyfriend?! First you were reluctant to help him and now you are doubting on him, that too just for one pay-check!!? And why do have to be so negative? Does it sound too impossible to maybe consider once that he is in some kind of trouble and so is not in a position to take any calls??    Sorry to say but you should show a little more Kindness and Consideration to him. And yes, definitely a little more Patience before you conclude anything. And irrespective of the fact that he returns you the money or not you should stop taking him as your boyfriend because there is absolutely no Trust on your part. Why to keep a relationship alive when there is no Faith or Trust?|`|AqqYZYycaa	It all depends on how good you know him. By posting the matter here in yahoo it seems like you know very little about your BF. If you are in love with him you need not worry about your money. But I am sure he will return your money one day though not on time only if you be in touch with him and keep him reminding about how important that money was to you also. A support given by you will surely bring him up in life and he will never forget this thing in his life. You are not been scammed. Its his hard time going on. He will return you the money soon.|`|b6a9a995d901f4cf962d62d2ef5eb525aa	YES!!!|`|1H56FPt8aa	He probably is avoiding you because he knows he owes you the money.

Im sorry.|`|szFDOaJLaa	Maybe, but he may just be avoiding you because he's embarrassed that he can't pay you back yet, try to talk to him about it without nagging too much, but still be stern and make it clear that you need your money as soon as possible|`|KiEPDEHkaa	Yes, it sounds that way! Try to get ahold of him, even if its calling him a million times a day. If you still can't reach him you'll have to call the police!

I suggest you don't talk to him though.|`|1148622cf8972dbc25aac49df8fd7415aa	why dont you test if he really kills himself or not. If he does then automatically all your problems will be solved.

Which by the way that has Nothing to do with sex!    I also have several brothers and when they get upset about misplacing something important, the same thing happens to them, as that girl of yours sweetie!

Don't be ashamed to use the help that is there either your doing it for your kids.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	What does the court order say?  You have to follow that.  The only way to get this changed is if there has been some major change since the order was put into place, such as you took a major pay cut or he got a major pay raise.  You have an obligation to those two children, no matter how much or little you make.  If you feel the order is incorrect, you don't need a lawyer.  You go down to the child support administrators-usually the district attorney's office-and file a child support modification.  They handle it.  There is no reason for you to have to hire an outside attorney.|`|yy45iAbtaa	look for legal aid in your town they should be in the phone book.if you can't find them in the phone book call your local welfare dep.and ask them for the number it is legal aid.|`|AA11089526	Go to your local legal services, usually the human resources department in your community can help.
AA12349214	Your first one.  Talk to him openly about it.  Friends can get jealous just the same as girlfriends/boyfriends can.  Especially if you have been friends a long time and especially if they havent yet found a significant other.  So talk to him.  Our friends are as important as our significant others in our lives.  It gives us balance and roots.|`|eG5W05Pbaa	id just ask him why he is the way he is when hes around her and tell him ot makes you feel uncomfatable, mates should be happy for ya not be rude|`|ZKw46efXaa	i think you need to confront him about this! its the only way to solve the issue!!!|`|A2HRe2c4aa	i think you should come clean to your friend, if you girlfriend is really important to you, then she'd be more important than your friend, right?|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If he is a long term friend, then I would talk to him and tell him what you notice. I wouldn't mention her feelings about it as he may take offense, but if you tell him you notice that lately he seems to ignore her and he won't go out when you invite him, maybe he'll tell you why. It may be that he thinks she doesn't like him and he feels like the 3rd wheel when he goes out with you so he doesn't go, or it may be he is jealous of your relationship and the time you spend with her. As a long term friend he should understand that you have to devote a fair amount of time with her and that you are trying to be fair by inviting him out, but he doesn't want to share so what does he want you to do? Sometimes it sucks getting older because our priorities change. Back in the day partying and going to games, or whatever you guys did as friends, was it and now you are looking towards your future, possibly marriage and children. You may have to accept he doesn't want to be a part of that chapter in your life.|`|YzKRUniLaa	jst let them sort it out between themselves|`|AA11871047	well i dont suppose ur frd is acting out of charecter without any reason.... ask him y he's behavin in such a manner.... may be he's just insecure tht u're probably not goin to share the same bond u had before    well if u're pretty serious abt ur gf then well dont let her down... ur frd may come to realize his importance in ur life in the future but ur gf will never return to u if  u let her down once...|`|mIPxH501aa	he is your friend, that does not mean he has to be your girlfriends friend, although his actions are a bit harsh and you should talk to him, maybe he is shy, talk to him, I think he feels frightened that you will no longer stay friends with him, so just explain it to him, hope it works out.|`|rsIyLZHKaa	who is the best company who makes you laugh.your friend is feeling left out as he is problay needing t get a girl of his own and feeling jelous of the 2 of yous.this is why he is blocking your girl out|`|R6mAtMtJaa	If he's a good Friend then he will want you to be with her an he will at least try to get a long with it.

ZSznCJhSaa	You know the answer to this question. You yourself said that you need help with your "abusive" relationship, that means you know its bad for you and for your baby. But I know from experience that just because you know the relationship is bad for you, doesnt mean you can make yourself leave.  They trick you into thinking that they might change when they are nice and sweet, and you are so relieved that they are happy with you that you don't want to do anything to jepordize that. On top of that, youre scared of what they would do if you left them, both to you and themselves.   And, even though everyone tells you your crazy for doing so... when you guys are happy together, you do love them. And there are good things, they just are far outweighed by the bad.    But listen. This guy is no good. You know it. You know he is no good for you. You may argue that in his own way he cares about you, but that doesn't matter. He doesn't know the meaning of real, honest love and affection. He is controlling, manipulative and childish/immature.     Think of it this way, do you really want your son or daughter to grow up crying as much as you do every day because daddy hit mommy or because daddy hit them?! No. You love your child and you can leave this man for them.     You don't deserve to be treated like this. No one does. You've made mistakes but you can not let him tell you or manipulate you into thinking that you have to stay with him because of it. Your mistakes are entirely unrelated to your relationship to him. Even if you did hit him, by doing so you didn't give up your right to want to leave. And if he says, you have to put up with me because I put up wth you... then say, You have had the choice, same as me, to decide you wanted to break up with me. You don't want to, I DO. But you never had that option stolen from you.    I know how these guys can isolate you. Make you feel badly for having any friends and then you drive them away because they are tired of hearing you be upset about this guy and not do anything about it.  But you are stronger than that.  Even if it doesn't seem so.  You can break up with him.    I don't know if you want to, but, I really sympathize with you and if you ever feel like you really don't have anyone to talk to at all you can email me. There should be a way to if you go to my profile.       Break up with him. You know thats the right desicion.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	get rid of the jerk before he kills you. it happens everyday.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Domestic violence, attempt at rape (or even rape), intentionally damaging property...    You have a police case here against him.  If you are scared, why not go to the doctor (to get a check up, as you are pregnant) and then talk to the doctor about this, and ask if he can phone a police officer to come to his office to have a talk with you.  They can bring you home, and arrest this maniac on the spot.    btw - the drugs make it even worse.  What if he gets really angry when coked up?  You could end up losing your child due to violence, or even both the child and your life.    Do not wait any longer - take action NOW.  Does he work? Because then you could consider calling family, to come and take you away.   In that case, take everything of yours that you value. Leave behind what you can live without - and get out of there.    Don`t fool yourself to think you love this lousy excuse for a man.  A real man would NEVER treat his lady this way - no matter what.|`|doxZYj0raa	He is the phsyco!  You don't need to apolagise for anything, seriously!  You should get out, leave him while you can and tell the police when you get the chance.

Do you really want that??  Don't be silly... this man has absolutely NO LOVE for you... otherwise, he would not be hurting you emotionally, physically...etc.  Love does not equal pain... get it??  Leave him and don't look back, or...expect more of this and worse.  And as for you sweetie, you need professional counseling so that you never ever allow anyone to treat you like this again.|`|DlHfmzaiaa	I feel for you Im going through a simlar relationship myself, except my guy doesnt sound as bad as yours and im not pregnent.

The other day I was just getting in to bed and he was cross cos i woke him up so he grabbed me downstairs jumped and bashed my head against the wall he wasnt sorry.

If i was you i would get out of that relationship asap, its scary at the start but in the long run is a majour relief as you wont have any one to report to or be beaten by.

And if they don't like it, that's their problem.  it's your face.<br>  <br>  And he's not your boyfriend: you're just dating.  A boyfriend is like a lover, there's more than just going out going on.  If there's no kiss, he's not your boyfriend:  he's still at a stage of attempting to become your boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  And that's where your reluctance to kiss comes from.

Read the whole article because you will find it interesting, and also there are other things you can read that he may do that proves he likes you.|`|5XERNFogaa	Yeah, it sounds like he likes you. All that staring & talking wouldn't be for nothing :) He might be a little nervous about it, but I don't know him, so it's up to you to judge that. If he is, I'd try talking to him first sometimes, or inviting him to hang out or whatever, to kinda give him a break. Plus, then you'll really be able to gauge how much he likes you by his response.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|kduFYoCVaa	Well id definitely take that as an hes interested! how bout giving him a smile when he stares at you and give him a bit of encouragement. hes probably too nervous because he thinks your not interested, i'd give it a go, you havent got anything to loose! if nothing happens but he carries on staring hes probably shy so just say 'hey' see what he says and does<br>  you never know!<br>  x|`|ddPDskkXaa	He definitely likes you.

b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	I'm guessing this wouldn't matter to you if you didn't wish you were dating his brother instead of him. Otherwise, just ignore it.|`|mrDi6X0raa	aww let him eat dat pussy|`|ZdF1hx70aa	By bringing it up all the time it seems like you like the fact that his brother likes you.Your bf probably doesn't want to talk about it. I don't blame him. But you should tell him that your sorry for not dropping it and stop worrying about what he thinks. Just move on. Talk about things you enjoy together.  What did you talk about before this? You should get it back to normal. Remember you may be the one making it weird.|`|MgMsMExPaa	give  your boyfriend a break, he has been hurt by his brother and all you can think about is your own feelings. Give this a rest because he is grieving the loss of the trust of his brother. This is serious stuff here that could split the entire family.|`|FVhnOfxcaa	he probably just feels threatened by it. i wouldnt bring it up again..it makes it weird...|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	I think that you two have drifted.|`|m32ylhb5aa	Hmm, well I'm having trouble understanding the situation but it sounds like you two are just keeping all these frustrations bottled up and are just trying to deal with them for yourselves. Maybe try talking to him about it and telling him how you feel and ask him to do the same. Tell him that it feels really weird between you two and you don't like it and want to fix it because you want to be with him.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	Just stop bringing it up. What's the matter with you? Of course your bf will be pissed off. I could imaging why he isn't normal. <br>  <br>  For a guy like that, you have to drop the whole drama like nothing happened and enjoy being with him. Take him out to a nice place or do something adventurous. It's really hard for a guy to forget the things in the past, but with the help of their loved ones, you could really speed up the process.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|v2nh34uMaa	Well first of all don't bring the situation up infront of your boyfriend everyday.<br>  He probably doesnt want to hear about has his brother likes you.<br>  <br>  I don't know why you would even be dwelling on the subject, unless you like the brother too (whic you probably do).|`|lJ0v02uwaa	Seriously just go up toi him and say you no wot i dnt car and then just kiss him n it'll be ok well i hope just act as u did b4 hand
48W167cBaa	Are these two friends really worth being around? You didn't give examples of how they're 'mean', so I don't have much to go on. If they really do bother you, move on! And remember, you don't have to conform to 'groups.' Maybe you could hang out with both groups of people.<br>  <br>  It really sounds like the first two girls are irritating you though- I'd politely move on if they're really not worth the trouble, headaches, and stress.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|2WheRqWwaa	sounds like you dont really enjoy the people you hang out with. the other ones sound really cool so whichever makes you the most happy you should go with. by the way, even if they are really hurt if you do choose to switch groups, they will get over it.|`|XAcxEVGRaa	Kinda seems easy. If you're unhappy with the group you're in now then just go to the 2nd group. But why do you have "groups"? Why can't you just hang with diffrent people?|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Why don't you just make the decision that you KNOW makes sense. You don't need our advice use your head.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Why can't you be friends with both groups? Don't ditch your friends. I get ditched way too often. It doesn't feel good.
M99PWlUgaa	If its a guy you like say its something thats been bothering you.  That way it seems like you dont believe it necessarily, but you want him to put the rumor to rest.  Based on how he responds/reacts you should have your answer|`|wuKs4Q8aaa	say "hey ive heard something about you and i was just wondering if it was true, dont get me wrong im not accuzing you of anything, i was just curious"<br>    sorry thats the best i got|`|PLsJpPqOaa	telling them/ asking them something along the lines of " hey i heard that you were ________. (fill in the blank) Is that true?? "<br>  hope this helps
aZOoHWaGaa	If she is really your best friend the best thing to do would be to try to ignore the fact that you like him. If you tell her that you like him she will just think that you are jealous and i am sure that you do not want a guy to break up your friendship
xBd96wvRaa	If he is harassing her or she feels threatened - she can get a restraining order and just change the locks.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	are they living on a house is he renting with her is the lease on both names? I dont know  in wish State your son lives in? but here in Texas we call the Sheriff and they will take him out of the house real fast|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	Tell you're son that you're disappointed in the way he is acting; that he is being immature and that he should move out instead of embarrassing himself this way.<br>  <br>  As a parent, your opinion counts for more than you think.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	yes you can, has there been any physical abuse? abusive emails or text messages? If so, use that against him.|`|BvE0qcgmaa	I think your just gonna have to wait 30 days. That sucks. But you will have time to plan a party!|`|X05GAaLeaa	Just wait the 30 days <br>  its not that long|`|p2brbBOeaa	I feel for your situation, I just went through something very similar.  Unfortunately, there is really nothing they can do because the law states 30 days.  Unless you are in a state that is backed-up with evictions, then it could take longer.  If they are living together, then she can get a restraining order against him and then he will have to leave.|`|izSUt509aa	not enough info - a lot will depend on where he is living-different states-different rules.  also, is he a paying tenant? is he staying with her 7 days a week or is there somewhere else he stays occasionally?  does he have furniture in the home or just his clothing?  depending on different variables it could be just a matter of changing the locks when he is not there.|`|iuTn6OwSaa	just wait the thirty days... its not that long. And it will be over before you know it, if he has already been there for a year a month wont be too much more...youll get through it|`|PAWMAPh2aa	Tell them it's haunted.|`|0f85647fdd2f49d15133f974c8cc8f80aa	Tell him that he can stay with you|`|otPv8mFTaa	change the locks and put his clothes on the lawn|`|l9PkppP1aa	just fight back<br>  girls can play dirty too<br>  find out what really gets to him
KJxwNfsaaa	well if you hear its better take there word,untill you find out if it really is.<br>  <br>  & im gonna have to say kissing is worse then him smoking<br>  smoking really isnt that big of a deal.<br>  if you dont like it then dump him. he should respect your wishes if he really likes you.<br>  <br>  & since you wanna be together im gonna have to say forget about the past and move on|`|AA12400627	Well every relationship has it's ups and downs.....you're just discovering your differences.....he likes to smoke....and you don't.....<br>  <br>  The thing to do about that is to figure out how you're going to deal with that.....can you accept him if he smokes? Do you want him to stop?<br>  Find a way to compromise on that.....and in my opinion...if you don't like it....you should just leave him.....you can't force someone to stop unless they want to do it themself.....<br>  <br>  If you cheated on him because of the smoking....then shame on you! That makes things even worst! Why would you decide to do something to make matters worst? It does not solve anything but bring more resentment!<br>  <br>  I think that cheating is worst than the smoking! You knew he smoked when you first met him, but you chose to date him! In the hopes of what? Hopping to make him change? Not a chance!<br>  <br>  If you are the type who retaliates by cheating, then you better stop that real quick! That's the one thing that can kill a relationship quicker than anything else! You lose trust, you lose interest.....it just all goes downhill from there.....<br>  <br>  Start fresh and decide if you want to be with him or not? If all you did was kiss someone else and it meant nothing.....then decide if you want to be with a smoker or not....and move forward from there!<br>  <br>  Make up sex is only better when you both really meant it and decide to stop the childish tantrums!!!|`|2289cc8c8ba1c8770fe3ddce4448edebaa	its going to make things akward. its just like 'sorry have some so i can make up for it!' its kind of like buying your way back into a relationship. a bad one. first yeah its great then it goes downwards. u lie to each other. get mad have a fight (sometimes physical) and then ask for forgiveness so u can start all over again. end it :( it will hurt and u think im crazy but when and if it happens again you'll notice the chain.|`|H4dswqRlaa	If makeup sex is better, it is because the regular sex was burdened by things which eventually caused the rift.|`|zHI6z5FZaa	make up sex is good. it doesn't really matter if its better if it needs to be done. like in your case. just make it passionate|`|aSdUzlIiaa	im sure hes not thrilled with you either
dFHsAXDMaa	Leona Lewis---better in time always makes me smile when sad<br>  <br>  As a mother of 4 kids two girls 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11 I would tell you that your parents love you..... not sure what they lied about because you were not really specific but if it was telling you you would be able to say go to movies or something and then changed their mind it was probably due to everyone being scared about economy and trying to save save save<br>  <br>  if it was something bigger than that they were probably trying to protect you. I try to be honest with my kids about everything maybe you should just talk to them and tell them they hurt you by lying parents need to be called out about their behavior once in a while tell them you are getting older and can handle the truth okay cause in their mind you will always be their little girl who they want to protect. <br>  <br>  As friend my mother always told me.... in your life time you will be lucky if you have 2 or 3 really good friends the kind who will be there for you No Matter what.... the ones you can not talk to for days and then call and it was like you talked yesterday and everyone else are just people you know.... I know that sounds silly but she was so right you will learn this as you grow up go to college and the friends you only see on christmas break but talk to weekly from home and the ones you make later in college those will be your best firiends <br>  <br>  Good luck talk to your parents they need to know how you feel without yelling and arguing okay. Show them what a mature young lady you are but be honest about how you feel|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Behind These Hazel Eyes by Kelly Clarkson always helps me. Miss Independent by her too (I like to listen to sogs about making it on my own when I go through stuff like this). If you like country Leann Rimes' One Way Ticket/Because I Can is good too.
9auKzop0aa	I don;t think he likes you,you shouldnt bther.. Just date other guys|`|xBd96wvRaa	Date other guys. Sometimes a distraction will do the trick. Put post-it notes by each phone and on your computer reminding yourself to say no to this user of a guy when he contacts you.  <br>  <br>  You will never be more then booty call of convenience to him. Sorry.|`|VvRHin1Jaa	talk to him and get to know him better then ask him out|`|TyeuvRJzaa	I've Been through that Too. && The Best thing to do is Move On,Start dating other people,Have Fun,iS not an easy thing but just give it time.|`|jgULvu3Yaa	well if you mean doing it then... this guy is just using you just say noo for thel love of godl|`|KrpnKhFTaa	you'll just have to learn to resist me.|`|nE9IblEfaa	to tell yu da thruth ders nuttin yu an do about it|`|FATyhyZ2aa	I had guy like in my life for years.

Have some fcking respect for yourself.|`|AA11283706	stop giving in to him, no matter how hard it is. Make him chase you for a change. If he is interested in you he will pursue you. If you make yourself too available I don't think will take you seriously.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	If you really think that he is the right guy then you should tell him the truth.|`|MgMsMExPaa	If sex is all the two of you want then it is ok. just don't let this continue into a real relationship with someone else.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	leave him alone. if he really likes you he'll come looking for you.|`|LBbKmemxaa	maybe he's "mr right" for you - you just gotta tell him!|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Yeeeeaaaaa if he's with other girls and your with other guys and then your having sex or doing whatever w/each other your just begging for an STD or STI. Get over him, he's just a "sex buddy"..Make yourself stop calling him, when you get the urge to call find something else to do or someone better to call and when he calls either dont answer or answer and tell him you want everything or nothing at all, its just too hard going back and forth. Tell him "I cant do this anymore, either be with me and only me or nothing" He might beg for you to change your mind but be strong, your only hurting yourself with keeping this fling alive..|`|Rg2tqEPkaa	You liked him for a while so its going to be hard to let him go.

LmmMosVKaa	I've never had any experience in this field personally but I'll give you what i can... I think if he really liked you he wouldn't hide stuff from you.Try to talk to him and see what he'll say. Tell him how you feel. All good relationships have good and bad days. Trust me. My family is like a roller coaster. But were all happy still. Life is an emotional thrill ride. talk to him, se what he has to say. explain you're thoughts and worries to him. I'm sure he'll lighten up. Try to talk to him over his favorite dish. It'll ease his mind. Tell him how you want a sturdy relationship. He may not be hiding stuff from you and he may. Just look at the brighter side and it will All straighten out i'm sure.|`|41JhpCRpaa	well if you dont trst him leave him
k9txFCTlaa	okay for girls age doesn't really matter. we dint care if your older or younger. if we like you, we like you and that's that. to try and get her attention you could ask her for help on a problem you have in the class you have together. if worst comes to worst give her a subtle compliment. every girl loves to hear something nice. and lastly just be yourself. show her your personality and make her like that.|`|we2Csi51aa	just talk to her more until you guys are friends. and than hang out with her.|`|II4Po8CZaa	w8 till you guys are friends then make your move|`|8XEIMuBqaa	HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to forehead.|`|bc70e3a16900c4dd03ebe4dc89b0161daa	Sometimes its the simple gestures that go a long way.

JhvqUvlsaa	Well since your friendship is online and you don't see him in person much there's really nothing you can do about it. You are either going to have to get over your jealousy and let them do their thing or you're going to have to bow out of the friendship. You don't really have a right to interfere unless there's something horrible going on like abuse or something.|`|RR8K8m6Waa	this is a very strange jealousy seeing as you're online you can't really do ANYTHING. so just get over it and start crushing on somebody you can actually touch instead of staring over a monitor at(the touch thing was meant in a totally non-perverted way.)|`|VgVoz2mzaa	- you can act like you dont care<br>  - you can tell him how you feel<br>  - tell him, "if he wants to be with her then go, but instead of talking to me about her, because i really dont wanna hear it. Or you can just continue talking to me because i wont play with your heart"<br>  - just tell him you dont care and move on, that'll make him jealous, or talk about other guys in front of him.|`|XAcxEVGRaa	You don't even have to tell him with words. When he talks about her just say "Oh cool." Then change the subject. Or you can give him your concerns. Just fo what feels rite. Good luck hun.|`|2XTkSV4daa	To be a true friend you need to listen to your other friend and love them not matter what. You can tell him your true opinion of her but prepare for him to be shocked and hurt. You can also tell him that you like him, but prepare for pretty much the same reaction. But to be a true friend, just tell him you're worried about his heart and all that and hopefully he listens. Or you could talk to the girl herself and see if you were right. Other than that, you should just wait it out...sounds like with this girl, you won't have to wait long.|`|HuH0KBc5aa	Well if you really don't wanna hear about this girl, either tell him or start a conversation you two will be hooked on. If he mentions her, just say " You know what? Shes not that interesting. This ____ is way more interesting " and start to talk about something else.<br>  <br>  Jealousy is nasty. end of story. In the end, your just wasting your time thinking about all the people you may be jealous of. No matter what, hes still gonna talk to her and she will still talk to him and you will have done nothing to cure your jealousy. It will always be there. Its normal to be jealous. But think about it.... its a waste of time.|`|OzuXJnjkaa	I know exactly what you're going through. I had the same problem a few months ago with this kid I went out with. His ex girlfriend came back and started flirting with him, and he fell for her pretty fast which caused him to dump me the day after our one month which completely sucked. He would never shut up about her. But she always hurt him, and it always bothered me so much. I got very jealous, but I didn't make it too obvious. I stopped talking to him, but he always came back to me. I got over him, thank God. I really dislike girls that play hard to get. Good luck & don't worry. You're probably ten times better than her!|`|bp0SbC44aa	It is possible that this guy tells you this tuff to make you jealous. I'm wondering, does he know you feel so strongly about him? maybe tell him, does it really matter if he says he doesn't lve you back? yes it will but just tell him you care so much about him and your glad that he found someone he likes but that it makes you feel horrible inside when you hear about the funtimes your dream man had with someone other than you.
cvUbhrRkaa	Yes, in a way that is an indirect threat.  Usually it would be something like: "you know, you should be careful - people that don't eat their vegetables might find themselves in a heap of trouble."

Just remember, when you get a boyfriend, he will want sex.  Sex complicates life like you wouldn't believe.  Personally, I like it.  I waited until I was 17, cuz I was shy.  Once I did it, I wanted it all the time, so be careful.  EDUCATION!!!!!!!  Have fun and enjoy your life, it can be too short or too long.  Be open-minded and don't be dumb, dumb people suck!  Peace.|`|8EGOd9dhaa	the best advice I can give to you is to follow your instinct.  I understand you are having mixed feelings about the situation at hand.  If you like him or think there is a chance that you could have something good with this person then go for it and take the chance.  But if you just feel self concious about not having a date then dont, that is what would be considered the wrong reason to ask him.  As for the whole facebook thing, I dont think that would be weird or ackward at all, I mean afterall thats what its there for.  Hope this helped at least a little bit and good luck.|`|THAMJdQyaa	Here is sort of a guideline of what I would do<br>  Facebook: messege him say hey. Get him to comment back as for his email<br>  Email: IM him and talk get to no each other, ask for his number<br>  Number: get his number and don't just text him but call him ask him if he wants to hang out etc. Bring up the dance and try and get him to ask u|`|g6690Ebsaa	Find a friend thats a girl or guy go up to him whenever and just have them say hey why don't you ask that girl out,or to the dance.I used to see many good looking girl I did not talk to,maybe he thinks you are out of his league? you never know,wish you the best|`|LSCG8aGVaa	well if your alot more outgoing now.. then hun TAKE A CHANCE ! you have NOTHING to lose. so what if he turns you down. if he does he's missing out on an awesome girl. you seem like a neat girl. so take that change and be more outgoing. you will NEVER know until you TRY !|`|FiTaCjuXaa	Try adding him on bookface and, dont say anything to him until he says who is this, or something, after that gets cleared be like, sooo whats upp. and just keep talking to him from then.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Take the dive, and just do it go up to him and ask him out, or atleast go up to him and talk to him!|`|XeLZtw20aa	Well I would say no since you've lost interest.

How awkward could spitting game via internet be?|`|UhbyuzuXaa	Ask him if he wants to go as friends ... the worst he can do is say no. Life is a lot about taking risk's ... follow your heart.|`|x2WrV6l3aa	write a note and have your friend give him the note|`|5vT3UDYaaa	If you've lost interest then dont worry about it and go with someone else, and if there's no one else to go with go with your girlfriends, its waaaay more fun that way neways! If you are still interested then you MUST ask him, yes it will be scary and awkward for you but to him it will be very flattering, he might even blush if hes shy haha but as long as he's not going with anyone else I'll bet he'll say yes!!! And then you'll have that perfect date for the dance :) Good luck! And remember, he's obviously shy too but HE'S actually taken the plunge and talked to you once now its your turn :)|`|8UGsLuCNaa	Hey i was kind of in the same situation as you i liked a girl called lisa and we were always in the same classes talking and loving each others company until we studied different subjects , we then hardly spoke and occasionally said hi, The school prom was coming up and i wasn't sure but i talked to her about it and she accepted ,after the prom we soon started talking like we us to as if nothing happened. The only advice i can offer is to talk to him. Maybe talk to him through msn or something its private hopefully that way he wont seem as shy. You shouldn't feel stupid, at some point everyone has to do something that involves a bit of courage don't be scared ask otherwise you will never know.|`|MLYIz4Wjaa	if your going to ask him out or really shy about it the best way to do it is on instant chat because your more confident then and they are more likely to talk about dates and stuff. just get in convo, like make some jokes about something that happened,<br>  and say something like "soo what you up to?" "cause i'm soo bored at the moment lol"<br>  "want to go out somewhere?" "like get a hotdog and go see a movie?"<br>  also i have mixed feelings aswell about guys like, i oneday i have this major crush on someone and then they get a haircut or something and i start to lose interest. I know it sound really stupid! you just got to talk to him and find out his interests and stuff.|`|UfsnpP0jaa	hey,  tell him how you feel, dont do it in front of people and dont give him a note or a message on myspace/facebook. just verbal. whats the worst thats gonna happen? hes gonna say oh well i dont like you, thats fine, at least you did it, what if he says he does... =]=], trust me, if he says he doesnt like you, youll forget he existed in a month, but at least you did it. =]=]<br>  <br>  good luckkkkkkkkk <br>  <333|`|k9txFCTlaa	i think you should try and strike up a conversation with him. especially if you think he likes you back. try and remember something you guys have in common and ask him. or on facebook, send him something like "i haven't talked to you in forever! how have you been" it shows him that your still thinking of him. and i say you should ask him. the mixed feelings ur feeling are the crush wearing off. if you start talking to him again you might find out that you like him more than you even think you do.

If you decide to do this for your husband, be sure to take things slow and use lots of lube!<br>  <br>  Many people share the same views you have stated here but, if the act is between two consenting adults, I see nothing wrong with it.

I said then why don't you divorce....she says because they want to be together, they just need "pleasure" from the outside on occasion.  Confusing I know.

Tell your husband if he doesn't stop you will leave him.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	People who are having an open marriage, tell the other spouse first and get their ok.

R1vvH4aKaa	I am totally biased about your situation. I believe that a man can love several women at the same time. As for adultery, you have a legal definition (having sex outside of marriage) and the Biblical definition which is "It is interesting in the few references scriptures make about sexual issues it is always to the women. Again remember men could have as many wives and concubines as they wished, and adultery was understood as only being something a women could do, in violation of the property rights of her husband - was never a sin for a male...How Sex Was Made A Sin<br>  The Emperor Constantine in about 300 A.D. was perhaps the world's most important convert to the new religion of Christianity. Christianity was perhaps the only thing left to try to hold the Roman Empire together. While the political empire fell in the next century, the Church stepped in as the new central authority. Threats of burning in hell were even more effective than the army for controlling large and diverse populations.<br>  <br>  Augustine (354-430 A.D.) was a primary theological shaper of thought and went so far as to argue that sex was sinful even within wedlock unless the specific purpose was always conception! This reflects the need at the time for many more children. Infant mortality was very high and the economic and political structures were based on families. Likewise, clerical celibacy was in part shaped by fear that offspring would fight over Church property.<br>  <br>  Thanks to widespread illiteracy - or apathy -whatever the Church said was now law. Intercourse was no longer natural and good; sex was dirty and only for procreation. Celibacy was the new standard for the clergy. And it was a great money maker!" So if you are not married, there is no Adultery in Biblical side. Legally, yes.<br>  <br>  However, if you two will continue with the relation, you have to remember that there will be many jealous people that want you two to split because of morals, when in reality is pure envy!<br>  <br>  Epicurious once said, "Life's good things are enjoyed in SECRET!"<br>  <br>  So, if you three can reach into a agreement then enjoy what you have. It is your private life, but remember do not become a marriage-wrecker!|`|Q5BM2POnaa	Learn where to apply periods and commas for a start, so we can undertand your question.<br>  <br>  If you're saying you fell in love with a married man for starters, you're both trash.  For another until he actually leaves his wife and marries you; don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth, especially a professing of love.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, married guys who are cheaters will say anything to keep their booty call mistress from leaving them.  Until you get some self esteem and some backbone and realize you deserve a guy who is 100% available to you, he's got what he wants and will keep saying anything to keep it.|`|PVsKQAVEaa	aretha, ignore the messages above. i use to think the same thing they say, however no one knows how it feels until you are in the same situation. its not easy falling in love with a married person. i know because i am in the same situation. try to be patient in waiting. yes it is wrong what we are doing, but if his marriage will simply not work, then what else is there to do? but divorce. i know its a big pain to be in this situation, not being able to be with that person especially when you most need them, at night, holidays, weekends. etc etc. i know, its really hard and it hurts. know that iam here in the same situation and i feel your pain, good luck.|`|oauYuhvDaa	People are jealous?!

However, I don't personally know this guy, so I can't speak for him.  Just hang in there and let him go.  There are plenty of other guys out there who can treat you right.

What if while you were not in touch something happened to one of your sisters? or both of them? could you really live with knowing that you were not there for them when they needed you? If you could then maybe you should go away, but don't bother contacting them again...they brought you into their home when your birth mother didn't want you, you should show them the respect of keeping in touch with them. I am not saying don't move far away, just don't lose contact.

This is what I said, " Whether you feel claiming that you were the one who dumped me is irrelevant. The truth of the matter is, I realized that you were a mistake in my life. You dumped me, I dumped you. It doesn't even matter. I'm just happy you're outta my life. " *click*  I just hung up to her in front of her face. Cold hearted? Yes but it felt soooooo goood. <br>  <br>  The point is, whether or not who claims they did what is besides the point.

NGYoZs1Kaa	yea shes probably like , "you dont wanna talk to me now ? , okay whatever" thats what i would do . it wouldnt be weird if you asked her to be your geometry partner depending on the kinda girl she is . Nice girls would say "yea , okay" and some would say "so you wanna talk to me now?" .  ignore her friends . and YOU say hi to HER because she thinks your still ignoring her and shes probably afraid that you'll ignore her again if she tries to say hi .<br>  <br>  (:|`|AXmDf9WTaa	firstly, stop ignoring her. girls hate that! if you wanna start talking to her again just be like "sorry i was a bit distant, i just had some stuff going on" or something like that and get talking to her again. then ask to be her partner in class.<br>  <br>  continue talking to her, text and call etc and eventually you'll become comfortable with her. of course if you do like her, you'll probably still feel a little nervous around her but thats normal. <br>  <br>  then, if you connect and get on well and cut out all the game playing, then take her to the movies or something :) x|`|4oFpT7m3aa	-it could be a good thing if she said that<br>  -partner up with her<br>  -no it wouldn't be weird<br>  -start talking to her in class more often, then spend lunch with her, then her and her friends<br>  -ask her out <br>  good luck chris|`|1dP7Viiuaa	you know what bro? the last thing you should ever do when u like someone is to ignore that person and play hard to get. she probaby thinks you dont like her anymore/probably thinks shes irritating so shes stopped contacting you! big loss for you there! only way to salvage the problem is to start being friendly and nice all over again. and after that dont you try and ignore her or anything again.<br>  <br>  girls dont like guys who play games. its childish. just get to the point and dont waste her time.|`|6ySVF6zRaa	I think i know what you mean but in reverse cuz i'm a girl.

If a guy did that to me, I would be really offended and wonder what I did wrong, then I would call my friend and we would talk about what a jerk he was and how I was too good for him anyways, if he was going to treat me like I didn't exist. Then, I would build up my pride, have my friend prank call him and tell him to die in 7 days (this could vary on the friendship said girl has with her girlfriends, no homo), and then proceed to not talk to him so that I could get over him. All of this would be done while consuming copious amounts of chocolate, and complaining about how my thighs were going to explode due to said supplment of chocolate. So, in short, you're stupid for listening to your brother and need to go on bended knee and apologize and ask her out. Well, not really. That would just be kinda weird. I would suggest LYING to justify your not talking-ness (or telling her the truth which would make her laugh). But either way, you're going to have to take drastic measures and lose some prideful egotism. Good luck!|`|NnsdMOPlaa	If you think she is into you, then you should ask her out on a date.

They're also more stable and secure (not just financially) and have their lives sorted; they're more settled. What's not to love?

Some people even get to play some of them out, however, this particular one could get you and the older man involved into a-lot of serious trouble.|`|MgMsMExPaa	If you want older men then You should at least hold out until you are 18 because in some states you could cause them to go to jail for dating them. You should try to date people your own age until then. then go for the salt and pepper guys in college.|`|N2nFJvb8aa	you are doing just what you need to do . keep it quiet.<br>  dont act on this matter . it is a bad  deal for him an you|`|fC7IoWB0aa	omg it is so totes normal gurl im 15 n my bf is goin 2 b 21 in march n we r soOoOo in luv.
wtPYkznQaa	I don't think you should feel confused. Its seems more like your just curious because you've been with your boyfriend for so long you might not remember what it was like just to meet a guy your friend wanted you to meet. I don't think you should feel bad in any way just don't do anything you think you might regret. Just because you want to meet somebody new as friends doesn't mean you should question your love for your boyfriend. Obviously you can see that with 4 years of trust and love your relationship has grown strong. Well I wish you the best of luck. I hope that I could have helped you out any way possible.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	First off, why is your "friend" trying to get you to meet someone when she knows that you are with someone? Second, why are you letting her? Third, why are you curious? If you are happy in your relationship and don't want to hurt him, you will tell your "friend" to take her idea and shove it. She is not a true friend if she is trying to get you to cheat and you are not a good girlfriend if you are even considering taking her offer. If any of my friends tried to do that, they wouldn't be my friend anymore.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	it's not wrong to feel curious, but if what you have now is good...i wouldn't mess that up. if you love him and care about him, you should stick. just avoid this "other guy", and you'll forget.<br>  <br>  but if your not happy with your boyfriend, go see who this other guy is, so you wont miss out on what could have been.|`|pre1k4Pqaa	hi its ok to meet as friends ive had the same thing to kinda ive been seeing a friend but theres others who like me to so when i need to i say friends is cool but im just seeing someone now so i just save all the fun cool stuff to the one im seeing i allways hope my friends lisin understand they do.|`|oChms6KJaa	Well, maybe being in a long relationship kinda gets you wondering "is the grass really greener on the other side?"

Maybe cutting back is good for your personality.|`|F47MyGDSaa	Explain to him that honors classes are hard- they are. And he might not know because he might not have ever been in them- and use that against him. Just say "You don't know how hard it is! You were never in any honors classes!".<br>  <br>  Does he know it might change to a B soon? Plus you have a few months to get the grade up. And why is it a D? Did your teacher misplace something, or did you not turn something in?<br>  <br>  You don't always need straight A's to be successful. My sister, who ended up getting her GED (dropped out of high school), is almost an RN, making good money to support herself and her two kids. My aunt never went to college is she makes about 80,000 a year. College is however, important to have because it does get you more in a workplace setting.|`|2XTkSV4daa	You need to sit down with your dad and have a talk about this...that you think you deserve some time with your stuff and that you've earned it.

If you work hard enough and keep the good grades you won't have to worry about him taking away you stuff. he is Doing because he does no want you when your older to not have a job. Just keep Trying. Don't hate him for trying to help.|`|48W167cBaa	I'm an IB student in high school- also a freshman. It's a 'college level' classes, so I see your point of view. I make my four A's, and a few B's occasionally. <br>  <br>  If I got a C, or a D, (which hasn't happened- it might, though), I'd be grounded too. I wouldn't have any arguments, either. The being grounded gives you time to catch up in the class (finish up the late homework assignments, extra study time, go in for bad grades on tests and make them up.) After you're sure you've gotten the grade up, I'm almost positive you can go to a counselor and get a print out of your grade. Show it to your dad, and you should be off your punishment!<br>  <br>  Use the grounding to your advantage! There's other things to do- write in a journal, read your favorite books, read other books- draw! Make yourself an agenda, decorate it. Organize your desk area. You'll find things to do.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you! :)

IvMPh09baa	hey... i have the same problem!!!!<br>  <br>  we work opposite schedules though, but pretty much same situation.  I never see him, we don't talk and thus we have absolutely no communication except for 2 nites a week (after i get off work).<br>  <br>  Our marriage has gotten so bad because of the lack of communication and the lack of spending time together, that we are facing divorce.  Why be married and live separate lives?  Doesn't make sense.  We have tried everything, but no matter what missing time together is key to what our problems revolve around.  When we are not together and we work opposite schedule we have no time to communicate.<br>  <br>  I suggest do like I do, talk to your husband calmly about what YOU need to make this marriage work.  Love doesn't make marriage work alone, communication is definitely a major part of marriage.  And without him being home then communication is non-existent.  You feel apart and distant and you are worried your marriage will end up failing if he continues with this schedule.  Try to work on this together, what can both of you do to make more time together.  Does he need to change jobs again?  can he switch the hours/days?  try to solve this problem together, and not with divorce as the solution.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It isn't normal for a husband to want to be away from his wife if he loves her or is capable of loving her I should say. Some people are good at faking love which is easy, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty they are lost and don't even know they do it.<br>  <br>  Marital counseling would be a good idea if he will agree, if not you can go on your own to get emotional support and guidance.

You can fall asleep at night together and wake up in the morning together.<br>  <br>  -Both of you get a webcam hooked up to your computer. Cybersex, dirtytalk, etc. You're married- it's ok! (Just make sure that your footage don't get saved or attached to anything else!)<br>  <br>  -Send emails frequently.<br>  <br>  -Do instant messenger.<br>  <br>  -Call daily.<br>  <br>  -Do an internet search for "long distance dating", it will give you some ideas on how to stay close. (For instance, a "virtual date" - you both decide to watch the same movie at home at 7pm- it gives you that sense of experiencing the same thing at the same time.)<br>  <br>  -Commit to a specific time frame of when his travelling commitment will be through. How long will you tolerate it? Will he be promoted to a better position in a certain length of time? Can he transfer to a different position after so many months of service?<br>  <br>  P.S.- I advise he wear his wedding ring so other women don't assume he's single!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	He has a job??? just be happy about that!!!|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yeah, he's a quick learner, hmm.

o6gmUS67aa	Just act like the girl is just a friend, not cute or anything.  If she's just another person that you want to have a conversation with, then she immediately becomes less intimidating.  Cute girls don't have to be scary!  And if you're comfortable with yourself, the girls will notice.  Confidence is a good thing(:  Just don't become too cocky.|`|MgMsMExPaa	You feel this way because this is important to you  and you do not want to screw it up. What you should try is to learn some things about these girls tha you can talk to them about . Just some common intrest.

I'm like this with hot guys lol. I think the only way to do it is to practice a lot, just go up and talk to girls and you'll realise that they're only normal people... That they're often really nice and easy to chat to, once you're comfortable with it. If you have low self esteem, like you think you're not good enough to talk to them, work on that. Before you go out any time make sure you think you look good, not just acceptable but actually good, and it will make you feel way more confident about yourself. Make a list of all the things girls like about you - a lot of girls think quiet, shy guys are really cute.

Your too young to go any further.|`|J031Sg34aa	if you didnt feel anything your first time kissing a boy, then i dont know... i know that when i had my first kiss, it felt weird, and i felt like i was dreaming. but if you just felt like you werent doing anything at all, it means that it wasnt  really the right time.<br>  maybe if you wait for it, and you start to really like him, then youll feel something.|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	im guessing you didnt like him as much as you thought.. your suppose to feel some kind of connection if you LIKE the person.. maybe get to know him more.. i think maybe the kiss was a little to rushed and there was no real chemistry before the kiss.. it just kind of happend .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiHMP_ACRfxGuWKt4OszNL7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220162638AAFwOpm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QTysjfgPaa	He's so cute, maybe you didn't feel nervous or anything because you just feel really comfortable with him, that's what I think, if you say you really like him.<br>  :)<br>  He sounds like a keeper though - what with all the things he said to you that you answered in my question|`|2289cc8c8ba1c8770fe3ddce4448edebaa	u rushed things, more like he rushed things. u didnt get a chance to really know him or develop feelings for him. ive known the other guy for about 3 or 4 years.
KVFYJrDJaa	I don't care about a woman's figure really. It all comes down to how a woman carries herself. The flattest most slender woman can be as sexy as a voluptuous and curvaceous woman and every body type in between. It's all in how you wear it, how you use it. But everyone is superficial to some extent, so you have to expect a certain amount of adjustment time. For example, I can meet a totally smokin hot chick and be turned off in an instant by her attidute. Along the same lines, I can meet someone who is not traditionally attractive (take that how you will) and her attitude or her confidence or just a look in her eye can absolutely send me to the moon. <br>  <br>  Do not be embarrassed about the way you are made. Be healthy, be confident, be comfortable in your body and you will find it doesn't matter as much as you think.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	don't feel that way. forget what the magazine and all of that i am skinny to. and i could care less of what anyone else say's and the phrase " bigger women are real women or " real women have curves"  is total BS. but it does piss me off when they try to make them selves feel better by putting thin ones down. but i just laugh in their face cuz deep down inside a lot of them are bitter, angry , jealous and unhappy. it's all a cover up to make themselves feel better.<br>  don't let it get to you.|`|r3uKj1Azaa	I'm really into a girl that is tall, very thin (but naturally thin, she isn't starving herself!) and quite flat I suppose. But I think she's great, and she's got a great personality...so there is hope for you don't worry! :D<br>  <br>  And if you think guys are only looking for bigger women (i.e. fat women) you'd be wrong. I know it's politically correct to say that men like big women....but actually they don't. Average build is good, but any bigger and the amount of men interested drops off dramatically.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	I always thought men liked slimmer women. I'm a size 10 n im 13. I'm overweight, but I have a pretty big chest for a 13 year old. So as you imagine I must be tubby, but I always see other boys in my class go for slim girls. I don't know I think it's a 50/50...|`|zHI6z5FZaa	i like slim girls. don't worry about what all the magazines say. there's someone perfect for you out there, you just have to find them.|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	Heck no! There are so many guys in the world and each and every one of them has a certain preference. Some like super skinny and some like BIG girls. Some even like girls with shaved heads!!! It all depends on the guy. Just be yourself, love your body and who you are, the guys will too. Personality is very imortant...WAY more imprtant than looks. Be confidant in your self and they will love you just the way you are! It's corny and cliche but's so true! Try it! :)|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Maybe the first step to finding happiness, and the right guy, is to stop putting yourself down and to start thinking positively. You are wrong to think that all guys prefer women with massive boobs or really curvy figures. For every female shape there are guys with that particular preference. I for one don't care for larger boobs and have had women friends who have little or nothing in the way of a chest, but that didn't put me off them. For me, when it comes to physical attributes, the most important aspect is a pretty/beautiful face because no matter what, that is the part that you are going to see most of. However, even more important than that is personality, and self confidence is an important part of that personality.<br>  <br>  So,stop worrying about your chest, get out there and start enjoying your life, and things will get better.|`|4oFpT7m3aa	don't worry about it<br>  you'll find a guy who likes you for you<br>  don't listen to the media! they make you feel imperfect and made my self esteem go down the toilet i know this really skinny girl who has a boyfriend and she's 14|`|nkwsRizHaa	Calm down, there's someone out there for everyone :)<br>  <br>  so relax, and just enjoy life.|`|1HeGLPZaaa	I LOVE slim girls! You shouldn't worry about how you look. I know there'll be guys interested in you. I'm sure there probably already have been. :)|`|3KAiV9zTaa	Ok, let me tell you. What size you are doesn't matter at all. I never had a boyfriend or been kissed either until i got in the 10th grade( in the 11th grade now) and i met my true lover and who is now my fiance. I'm a small girl. My body is average, i'm skinny, but not so skinny that i'm practically skin and bones lol. My size is fine for someone my height which is 5'5 and not only and i kind of slim, but i have a small body. my waistline is little and everything. at first i thought i was too fat, now i feel like i'm too skinny. but now it doesn't matter. My body is fine and my boyfriend thinks so as well*.^  You don't want to be fat like the other girls. be glad of the body you have. Be proud now because once you lose that body it'll be hard to get back. Be one with the skinny girls lol|`|AA10796679	well, i am a man. true ,a much older man, but i will be extremely honest with you. first , you are at an age that is very very hard for teen aged girls. yes you will grow, how much is up to God. but to answer the question about men. i have never ever liked women with big busts. this may sound trite, but it is true,"everything over a mouthful is wasted" i have never gaped at girlie magazines because most of them are painted over and are Phony. the most important thing you will find is how you carry yourself and how much respect for you , you have. looks are only skin deep, it is true. start doing a people watch just for kicks, and see how many happy couples you can find that you wonder what in the world  she sees in him or he see in her? it isn't about the looks. not once you pass 17 and grow up|`|ai33g11Maa	Men don't care whether you are flat or have big boobs and curvy butt - they care about what YOU are like.  <br>  <br>  How you are physically built does not constitute YOU as a person.  That is a shallow way to think and live.  <br>  <br>  You need to learn to love yourself, and when you do, your confidence will show, and men will be attracted to you - no matter how much junk you got in that trunk!!<br>  <br>  Don't get too hung up on looks, cos then you are letting all those media hounds win.<br>  <br>  Good luck, relax and have fun! xxx|`|i94ZEqh9aa	Well, if it's any encouragement to you, I believe there is someone for everyone, even flat, slim girls like you. In my highschool, there was this one girl who was extremely thin and was almost completely flat-chested. She couldn't have been more then a 30A. She had no meat on her bones whatsoever, and she had freakishly small breasts. However, she was really confident, was mostly a nice girl, and was easy to talk to. She never lacked confidence in herself. She ended up getting dates with two men who were both handsome "jocks": one was a football player and the starting goalie on the hockey team, and the other was a star on the basketball team. <br>  <br>  I think if she could get a boyfriend, then so can you. She has confidence, and you will find a man who is attracted to that. I guarantee it

It's ur money. So u should keep it. Keep in separately. U guys aren't married, so what's his isn't urs yet. If he's broke, and ur not, there are reasons for that, and if u don't want to share ur wealth with a man ur engaged to, there are reasons for that. Both well thought out and profound I'm guessing, so if u don't want to share ur earnings, then don't. There are instances when u should, but I'm sure u know when they are(emergencies etc), but as I said, there's a q as to y he doesn't haVe any savings. That would perk up my senses too, so be wise, and beware, it's ur money, once it's gone, it's gone.

JhvqUvlsaa	Well if he doesn't care about you then his flirting and his "compliments" are just hollow words. Since you don't get to see him anymore, start writing in a diary or blog about your feelings and start to sort through why you are so hung up on this guy. You most likely need his words and his approval; you get a lot of words from him but not much approval. I would start giving yourself approval. Praise yourself for the stuff you do right and the way you are good to people. If you don't like your appearance then try to change it. But don't rely on others for approval and praise. Start looking within for that.<br>  <br>  And after you've blogged until you see some answers, it should be easier to start getting over this guy. And start avoiding him so you don't have to see him anymore.|`|XAcxEVGRaa	Okay #1 stop being a fricken drama queen. Did he ever say that he doesn't like you, NO!

F7EhEYSYaa	Well- Take the Advice from a Girl. I'm in 7th Grade, and I've had Bf's Like you in the past.<br>   She is not Feeling Pity for you. Trust me if she didn't like you or was "feeling pity" for you SHE WOULDN'T"T HAVE GONE OUT WITH YOU. <br>  But She obviously likes you a lot. And most girls really don't like      "omg, he's so hot kinda guys" Those guys are just there for eye candy. Guys like YOU are the Kind we really like. <br>  <br>  Wait another week maybe. Also, wait for a private moment between you too so it can be special. Chalk up on the Listerine ( once I had a BF who kissed me with Horrible Breath) Another REALLY Great time is right before summer break or a LONG Weekend- Memorial day is Coming up!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  Maybe, Hang out on the Friday of Memorial day weekend. Kiss her when you guys are finishing with your date, before someone picks her up or when you walk her home or something. Remember to make it Private, and during the weekend, call her once or twice, or she'll feel like she is being ignored. <br>   <br>  Being Quiet doesn't affect a relationship at all, I think you're good with that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!! <br>  <br>  If you need any more help you can e-mail me!|`|ONz3YZU5aa	Have you ever heard the saying, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?  It means that you should trust in her and in what finds attractive about you.  Hopefully, she is finding more things attractive about you than just your physical appearance.  Not that looking like Brad Pitt is a bad thing, but having a kind, generous heart, being funny, giving, loving, thoughtful, considerate and treating your girlfriend like a queen, these are qualitites that many women find much more attractive than just how you look.<br>  <br>  First kiss?  Be creative.  Take her for a picnic in the park.  Strawberries and cream or chocolate sauce make a great dessert to share a first kiss with.  Ever see Disney's "Lady and the Tramp?"  Remember the scene where their doggy lips meet as they eat the same piece of spaghetti?  Same idea, just with a fresh, ripe strawberry.|`|zat4Ja4Qaa	for some people it is not all about the looks. so if you can tell she's into you, then she probably doesn't care how you look - or you're judging yourself harshly and she finds you great looking as well.<br>  first of all, make sure she wants to be kissed on the lips. if you find that you both spend alot of time staring into each other's eyes & while you are, she does some smiling/fidgeting then she's ready to be kissed. during a quiet walk, or when you're about to say goodbye to her (typically at a moment when you're holding hands) stop, turn to her smile and go for a kiss. it would be so romantic!|`|mHXaoUbmaa	right girls ( decent ones anyway :) don't stick with a guy for pity , im sure you are paranoid firstly :) just becoz you can't believe how lucky you are ... and you should be reassuring her and telling her you value her and luv chillin with her :) thats what will nourture your relationship to a higher level , be honest , open free :)<br>  and deffinatly don't hold back ok ! :)<br>  girls love it when their guy shows emotion :)<br>  plus she obviously thinks your awsome .. thats why she entered this relationshipp or w.e : ) ..... so relax , be yourself and stop comaping ... i mean you wouldnt wnt your girlfriend doing what your doin now , would you? its unattractive trait, espesh if your not naturally like that !!<br>  <br>  oh and the more you think about the kiss the more stress will amount , when maybe sometime soon you open out to her like iv sed and are in a nice lovin state just gently caress her cheek down the the jaw sort of thing and hands through the hair ... make sure you show your enjoying yourself .. and its a nice ssetting:) .... and just begin to massage her lips with yours and nibble and get into it and she will soo love it and take over ;)<br>  <br>  hope i help buddy :) x|`|dk4uxqfCaa	yeah you're kinda being paranoid, but you dont need to be.  cause she wouldn't go out with you if she is a pretty as you say.  cause if she is, then im sure other guys would want to go out with her too.<br>  <br>  and the right time would be when ever you two are having like a special moment, and it just FEELS right. you know?so dont just like come out of nowhere, and kiss her, cause that would be really weird..so basically when it feels right. you'll know.|`|iIkW1eWIaa	Are you worried about how you look compared to her?

Have your bf ask his ex what she is into. That way you can tailor her visit to what she likes. Check into favorite toys, TV shows, swimming. Get a seat for the back of your bike and take her for a ride on local bike trails. Also find out about foods: likes, dislikes, allergies.<br>  As far as coloring goes make sure you get color wonder from crayola. they are more expensive but they do not color on anything other than color wonder paper and books. Does Not leave marks on walls or furniture either!!!
76d760cd47152ac5a27500d671f5bbffaa	it usually happens that after a while the honeymoon phase fades out.  it's only then that you find out what your relationship is really built on and whether you have what it takes to survive as a couple.  if you feel like you don't see each other as much, then you should together plan how to see each other more often.  if you love him, talk to him, voice what you are thinking or feeling.  don't expect him to read your mind, nor should you try to read his.  think of the things you guys used to do together when you started dating.  what was the thing that made you fall in love with him.  have fun, don't think too much of it.  just plan to do things together, and everything should work itself out.|`|11ce559ce8bafd7ef4e4d01807ccd744aa	there mite b many possibilities for wat is happnin....!! when u guys came together....it mite have jus been th initial craze...which usually exist in a relationship for aroun 2-3yrs... and gradually dies down....!! th thing existin between th couples cannot b called LOVE...it is CRAZE....but if u really feel u stil love tat person....then things lik....work...household....etc wil act as an villian in ur love life not lettin u spend proper time at first wit ur partner..and when none of th partners take th initiative of keepin th magic....th romance alive... everythin dies down as time passes...but hey...everythin is not lost...!! u can re-create th magic....!! start of wit a small step...probably dinner...then...talk abt old memories....GOOD memories...get close....keep it alive tat way.....make sure u guys give each other time before everythin else...al th best...|`|88e71f2152dc2a8a1cd596a22e2f70fbaa	Maybe you guys are hitting the comfy stage of the relationship - are you arguing more than usual, is that the magic that is missing?
i9HRqXgBaa	no ur ears aren't supposed to bleed at all|`|AA10918177	If you have good earrings in your ears (gold,silver) you don't have to change them.While your ears are healing only put it good metal preferable gold (10,12 or 14 karat) or good silver.Cheap earrings will tear your ears up.You may be one of those people who can only wear gold or good silver earrings.My mom can only wear gold or good silver.But, it you have gold or good silver earring you don't (and I wouldn't)change them.This is what I would do..get some gold post put them in..don't make them to tight.get a bottle of alcohol cotton balls twice a day soak the cotton on alcohol and clean ears without taking the earrings out.Twist (gently) the post and clean ears back and front.Do not take those earrings out for at least 4 months.even if they feel good.|`|OR73Qrzyaa	It's probably infected.and no,it's not supposed to bleed and hurt that much!|`|dbe4e2cbb0c2522b9c62a61a00310fccaa	i would let them grow back, and then get a doctor to do it for you, my ears did not bleed or hurt THat much
7ad5cc0b1e1e9c33fffe4554cf26af75aa	Well, that isn't exactly a reason to end a friendship. I see your point, you wouldn't want a "nerd" reputation, but maybe just be "hi in the hallway friends" instead of hanging out, just because shes a "nerd" doesn't mean you can't still be friends. Maybe you can make her not a nerd anymore :P. Good luck.|`|493fb2de13a0f9c12566130e665f191faa	Am sorry for saying that, but thinking in this way, makes u geek as well..If u think she is a nice person, at least to u, u have to keep her friendship, and help her to pass over what your common friends, are thinking about her...And good luck..|`|4Ibrc12Vaa	If you feel this way about her, you didn't have much of a "friendship". More like a useship. Any ways, if you want to end contact with her, try disconnecting. Act busy, and don't hang out as much. Return phone calls/emails less frequently, and make more plans to do other things. Introduce her to new people and new hobbies. Basically, drift away. If she's acting "clingy", because she may get confused by your behavior and may try to talk to you more, a more direct approach might be needed. Talk to her in private and say how you've valued your "close friendship", but you've drifted apart, too different, changed, need space, etc. State that you would still like to be acquaintances, but cannot connect as close friends. Be kind and gentle, and try not to act cold/angry. And, very importantly, do not bring up anything  she did, and say it was part of the reason you no longer want to be friends (for example: you're too immature...). <br>  <br>  Either way, she's gonna get hurt. She'll think stuff like "I spent a year with you, and you're just gonna throw it away like that?" Though, unless you're a good actress, she may not act too surprised at first. If you have been spending time with people who dislike her, and have been acting a little cold toward her, she may be expecting this. Your friend may even break up with you first.|`|FoaGiIqEaa	Sounds to me like the friendship has already ended as you were never a true friend to her.  Don't worry, she'll figure out what you're really like eventually.
8YbdYBXmaa	First impression are lasting ones, therefore they are the most improtant ones. Ask her what she wants!!! Try and find out what she likes before you make any concrete plans. You dont want her to be expecting something and only to find out she's totally disappointed!!! Also, try to throw in your own "Flava", let her see a part of you!! Just be yourself. You dont want her to fall for (or get used to) you when you're puttin up a "FRONT". Later on down the line you wont be able to keep up that "front" and your true colors will come through, which could cause alot of problems!!! Im sure she'll like and appreciate you for the person you are!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck, Hun!!!<br>  ~SweetS~|`|AA11990560	You can always take her somewhere romantic, like the park or dinner.  Find out her favorite type of flowers and surprise her with those. Treat her to her spa/facial and nail if she into this.  You can also try getting a blank card and writing in your own words on how you feel about her - then surprise her with the above mention gifts. Hope this works and good luck to you.|`|xUURxHt1aa	u dont gotta impress her just ask her

QJ931OsOaa	Just tell him you need some space.  He will get the hint.|`|GSGAR9cWaa	Well, in all relationships there are ups and downs, and yes, it may come to a point where you realize that the relationship isn't one that's really....fitting your vibes, so to speak. When you've reached a point like that, a lot of the time it would be best to sit down and talk it out with the person in the relationship with you. That way, you can both sort differences (and honest to goodness, through this method drama is avoided 8/10.) Although it might be hard for your partner to accept at first, the appreciation will show that you're considering their future well being without the existence of you. Not trying to sound cruel, but respectfully saying, it would be best.|`|afuWWKGFaa	I am in the same situation you are in with my boyfriend. <br>  <br>  and i am deciding if i should break up with him  or not. <br>  you need to say:<br>  this isn't working <br>  i think we should just be friends|`|di9b1uSlaa	Tell him that you aren't feeling him and you just see yourself with someone else but you wish him luck in life and you hope to still be friends.|`|gaXdqasAaa	just talk to him, tell him that u think that the 2 of u need 2 c other ppl b/c that'z just rude 2 stop calling them, i mean cuz they think that u 2 r still 2gether and everything and that ur still feeling them when thatz not the case so sooner or later they would find out, i think that u should just go ahead and tell him b/c itz better 4 him 2 find out 4rm u now, instead of waiting and letting his affections 4 u grow and turn it into an even bigger situation than necessary ya feel me so just tell him that u want to just be friendz but not in a mean way, let him down easy. make it so itz dignified and truthful, but in a nice way.
QxlkPahgaa	awww, that sounds so fun!!! a lovely teenage romance.<br>  <br>  my advice!!! if you only get to see him for a day or two, don't try to get all deep, lovey-dovey, or mushy.  that will probably just make things awkward.  I realize how at the age of 15, you have all these daydreams of saying "i love you" and "wow, we're meant to be together!" and everything.... but, those are best to be kept in your daydreams, especially with a guy you havent seen in sooo long!<br>  <br>  anyway, my suggestion is to look naturally gorgeous.  have fresh clean hair, a cute sun dress on and only a little bit of makeup.  try to give your skin that dewey look, like fresh young, and innocent... yet beautiful.  <br>  <br>  it's certainly ok to be shy around him at first, it's kind of endearing.  maybe kind of... look at him from the corner of your eye when you're talking to somebody else and give a shy grin.  that will really intrigue him!<br>  <br>  then, when you get a chance to get reunited alone, you should  ask him some questions and find out how hes been, what kinda stuff he likes to do now.... flirt with him, but in a friendly innocent way, if possible. <br>  <br>  he's probably just as nervous and excited to see you too, so he might be really anxious around you. try to be confident and relaxed, so he'll see you for who you really are.  <br>  <br>  When i was your age, i always made the mistake of clamming up around boys.... I acted uninterested and didnt seem friendly, so they thought i was stuck up or something.  It wasnt until college that I learned that the trick is to be very relazed and try to act completely natural.  <br>  <br>  for instance, im a big video game nerd, but i dont look like it. so, i used it to my advantage... the guys always would be like "oh wow, you're so different fro other girls."<br>  <br>  BAM! then theyre in love.<br>  <br>  the only problem after that is... then you lose itnerest and they're still in love with you.... that's a pain!<br>  <br>  haha, good luck!!!!!!!! hope you and your soul mate reall hit it off this summer!<br>  <br>  dont forget to get his email address or AIM name... or whatever he uses.|`|G7dvZtAZaa	Has anyone else noticed that spelling and grammar are dying arts?|`|7a97978aa2a2d43f7204880e3731b4e8aa	And what happened to the guy you met at the ski lodge 4 months ago?|`|HHYPgtgpaa	Tell him how you feel, you don't wanna go another 3 yrs without him knowing, because then he might have found someone else. Heck, he might have already. Sorry :(|`|fc7b9c9574d6f74c121ebba8e94ad5c9aa	It has been three years! Wow he might already be seeing someone. Guys aren't that great at waiting for someone, they usually find what they are attracted to if they get lonely! You would probably do the same thing if you were him and didn't know he liked you! But all you can do is wait and see what happens. Just this time if you get to see him make sure you at least get his email and number so you can keep in touch! Then you can slowly let him know how you feel. If you tell him during the little time you have you might scare him away! Good Luck!

1loHwDEWaa	Hello<br>  Im not sure about the difference between love and like - but I know about "love" and "in love".   When you are "in love" - its all butterflies in the tummy! and that warm fuzzy feeling, it's all new and wonderful! - "loving" someone is a greater more steady love that comes from being "in love" - I believe "in love" is a temporary state of mind that turns in to "love" - Love, being the most wonderful, strongest bond you can have with another.  I may not have answered your question - but I hope it helped.<br>  ???<br>  ~Missy~|`|AA11934671	You can like someone without being in love with them, but not vice versa.<br>  If you're in love with someone, you more than just like them.|`|MCj0TYG0aa	I guess love is a deeper feeling than like. You can like anyone, from your friends to your family to any living things on earth, but you can only love a few.<br>  <br>  Love is when you know that you can sacrifice everything for that person, even your own life. When you love someone, your emotions will be strongly tied to that person's emotions: if that person is happy, you will be happier; if that person is sad, you will be more depressed.<br>  <br>  Like is a lot milder. You would do all your best to help someone you like but you won't be able to sacrifice for that person. If the person you like is sad, you will feel sad with him, but not as much degree of sadness as him. <br>  <br>  You can forget about someone you like more easily than someone you love. Hating someone you love is easier than hating someone you like. Losing someone you love is scarier than losing someone you like.|`|RwwqGiSJaa	I never loved anyone so can't help you!|`|uSb7mxilaa	You like your best friend.  You enjoy spending time together, and have a lot of fun.  Between gf/bf, if you like eachother you are just more than best friends, then either:<br>  <br>  1) one of you usually has a crush on the other<br>  2) both of you have crushes on eachother, but its just the beginning of the relationship<br>  <br>  Love is a stronger sence of attraction it, on the other hand, comes in 5 forms:<br>  <br>  1) Eroticism - love focused on sexual desire, not to much deep feeling inbetween<br>  2) Platonic Love - an overly-romantic relationship NOT involving sex.  Very passionate<br>  3) Familial Love - A love between family "i love you like a brother"  This is the only form of love that lacks any kind of romantic bond<br>  4) Puppy Love - Basically a "crush".  This is usually in the sence of a student who has a crush on a teacher, or a kid having a crush on an actor/actress/celebrity<br>  5) Romantic Love - the most complicated.  it requires chemistry, time, and attraction<br>  <br>  hope this helps!
rLRoRyY7aa	It sounds like she isn't sure about what she wants. Some times, girls want to feel like they have someone by their side but they don't want all the drama a relationship usually brings. It sounds like she might like you. Give her some time. If a few more weeks pass and things don't change, than try seeing other girls. Sometimes it takes a little jealousy for them to realize what they feel for you. I don't mean for you to fool around. Something as Innocent as just talking to another girl and her knowing about it. Good Luck!|`|66gEfIKpaa	not wanting a relationship means she doesn't want a hit and run.<br>  <br>  I.E paula abdul|`|CG64v9Z9aa	It could be either. You just dont know. She probably does like you and maybe she doesnt want to hurt you, you cant really say unless you talk to her. you just need to ask her yoursel and find out. and dont make your friends ask for you, that just isnt right

8azqZNzkaa	OMG!! THIS TOTALLY SOUNDS LIKE MY SITUATION,. Truth is I've never gotten rid of him. I would tell him I don't wanna be with him he would tell me he understands but like a day later he would return and say "I can't give up, I'll do whatever it takes" Its so sad and so pathetic. HELL!!! LEAVE US ALONE. Doesn't it just make you feel like they could possibly have a shrine of u somewhere in their closets at home???? it totally creeps me out so i know how u feel. But i have a solution that i haven't tried but will. It may be able to work. Try ignoring him. maybe if he sees that you are not taking in what he is doing or much less acknowledging his presence he'll probably give up. If that doesn't work then resort to being a total "B****". LOL. It can stand a chance. But i'm tired of talking so maybe if i don't talk he'll take a hint. TRY IT. It  may just work.
029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	A lot of guys do this, believe it or not. It's when he's the most confident and has the alcohol help him speak. The problem is, that can't be the only time he shares his feelings or you'll start to doubt his sincerity about it. You need to discuss this with him - when he's sober. Tell him you feel he might not mean what he's saying because he's drunk when he tells you. See if this gets him to open up. If not, or he still just does it when he's drunk, you may need to take a break until he gets his head on straight.|`|AA11280073	You should be more concerned about the drinking than what he says.

AA10773974	<br>  Go out and do things with each other...movies, bicycling, long walks on the beach, go to the library, take in a concert. There are plenty of things that you can do that don't involve sex.  If you really look you'll find more... the paper always advertises about events that are free... |`|yg1wKPx1aa	By no sex do you mean no oral or hands touching intimate areas. Yeah foot,hand and back messages are a great idea in my opinion. Take showers or baths together that can be nice and you can even have the option of wearing swimsuits if you don't want to see each other naked either. A nice cuddle is always nice. Dry humping perhaps it is sex in some peoples opinions but nothing actually touches anything else so it isnt really. You could go to dance lessons also and be intimate that way.|`|uJfcCsXuaa	make out?<br>  or give each other massages lol<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HimBbU6caa	Sensual, physical contact builds sexual desire, not the other way around. If you are trying to stay sex free keep sensual touching to a minimum. Focus on mental stimulation to keep things interesting. 
UW6AWmnOaa	depends on the guy <br>  <br>  Some are shy so they might try to avoid eye contact<br>  <br>  Some are confident and would smile<br>  <br>  Some are somewhere in between and they might not know what to do, or they are clueless that you're even staring at them.  lol.|`|844DGAMmaa	I would ask her out. |`|tfPryCQdaa	Hmmm...I WOULDN'T look away.

Oxytocin creates a bond between people, promotes trust, makes you less critical of mistakes, etc. Inside of a marriage oxytocin can help people grow closer.<br>  <br>  Outside of marriage oxytocin can make life confusing because of the bonding and break-ups between people. The strongest oxytocin bond is formed with the first person you have sex with in your life.

When I finally allowed myself to leave my ex husband, it was such an immense relief , I can't even describe the feeling. I actually sobbed uncontrollably for about 2 hours when I finally decided I was going to leave..and not out of sadness or regret I promise you.  I still can't believe I stayed as long as I did.|`|AA11596133	Some people really do not know how to enjoy sex, or really are not all  interested in it.  USUALLY that comes from something from their past, but if this guy is not willing to admit it, or truly does not CARE to change the way he is, then YOU need to leave him be and move on.  You cannot, and should never FORCE your wants and needs on to someone who OBVIOUSLY is not on the same page as you are.  <br>  <br>  I am sorry to say, you are beating a dead horse, so stop torturing yourself AND him, and find someone who is a better fit with you.  |`|e98RKB35aa	He sounds weird to me.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	sorry.. but dump him .. or spend the rest of your life looking for sex |`|AA11501437	I might be way off base, but in your whole question, it seems to me that he tried to answer whats wrong - "he does want sex but we have to build it up slowly, he has to not feel pressured into it and he has to feel close and in tune with his emotions."<br>  <br>  Maybe you aren't totally listening to this?  Maybe this is really going on with him...I can't imagine a guy saying these words, therefore it could have really come from the heart.  Maybe he needs some more intimacy before he can feel more sexual with you?<br>  <br>  It can take time and work to get back into the groove of each other - especially if you have the love hate thing going on..some guys (like many women) need to feel close to someone to get the sex drive going.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  |`|XtwsTwp0aa	Gay / Insecure / Incapable.|`|7OHudVxiaa	not in the mood<br>  gay<br>  not botherd<br>  dick problems and embarrassed (warts etc  horrible that)<br>  at least he anit a horny basterd|`|e35e563de072fa05692e56acda24a6e9aa	He has way too many issues.

WOW! WOW!<br>  I am married and have the same problem with my husband. We have been married three years, been together for four years. We talk about this all of the time. I asked him does he ever miss having sex with a woman because he would rather gratify himself while watching porn. His answer was "sometimes". He says he loves me and I am the best thing that ever happened to him. Last night I told him "men at your age are always in heat" and you just have no desire to have sex. He said it may be because he started gratifying himself at age 12 and it just became his way of pleasure. He says he has never been molested. All the while I am thinking if I can't get it from you, I will get it from some place else. After all, he is cheating on me by viewing the porn and gratifying himself right? I wonder what he would do if I was to get it from someone else? I don't want to have to spend the rest of my life chasing sex either. We are gonna go see a marriage counselor as soon as we can get an appointment. Any advice, suggestions? I am all ears.|`|AA12166706	im gonna seriously tell u what i think. he is either gay, wants to wait for marriage, or isnt telling you something. he prob had a very bad experience. if u love him it shouldnt be an issue. dont bring it up unless ur trying to figure it out. let him come to u. get a sex toy even. make him want u instead of going after him. tell him not to tie u up and just do it straight for once. make him need him. tease him a little, just dont let him kno u r. even make him think ur gettin it from somewhere else. anything, just dont leave him bcuz can prob help him.|`|KsFqEL7vaa	   Tied him up everytime? Wow, that would certainly make a guy trip out. Every time?<br>  Ok , here's the deal; just chill about it all. He is not ready for what you want. He may never be ready. Plus side, you're young. Don't get talked into getting tied up every time; that's insane. He would relax more if no one was tied up and involved "freely". <br>  Try it and don't make me beg too !   monk|`|dafffb13015825d5e0f66d2d7dfb8296aa	You have three choices.. <br>  <br>  Be patient with him and seek some help to find out how he can work through this problem.  You can't create a sex drive that's not there.<br>  <br>  Deal with it and chance being unhappy<br>  <br>  Discontinue the relationship.  Sex is a huge part of a relationship for most people... If you're not happy there, believe me, it will spill over into the rest of your relationship and affect it.|`|vtFuMjXtaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  First thing that I wanna say here is that sex is not the only thing that one can enjoy in a relationship. No doubt it is important but the most important things are love and attention. If you are getting both of these things from your guy then I think there's no point in thinking of breaking up.<br>  <br>  Talking about what happened in his past with his first girlfriend was definitely something that he never liked due to which he has developed a kind of "fobia" against sex, which can be easily understood. He wanted to remove the frustration about it that's why he tied you up everytime so that he can take the control of everything while making love. <br>  <br>  Okay, if I were in your shoes I would've tried to talk about it peacefully. Try to understand him and his fear against it. Also, try to get his body crave for you maybe by looking hot in front of him or by giving certain eye expressions, you know how it is. If still it doesn't work, consult a psychologist, he might come up with a good solution for the fear he has against sex.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!
7hyc2zfXaa	Big boobs are good boobs, that's what I always say.  I don't think that I've ever seen big boobs that weren't saggy.....unless they were fake, which is really yucky!  Love the big saggy boobs baby!!!|`|7PbIfBmoaa	Biggy is very good.  Saggy is sad.  They need the good support of the good hands.  Let the man play with them.|`|pZevjTXGaa	It wouldn't bother me at all|`|xGkJGvSiaa	me personally wouldnt like it means after 40 they will sag a lot, but i would just say get surgery and id stay with her either way if she did or not as long as we love each other|`|AA12123970	I OK with it. For me it comes down to both of us having fun in bed. Go for it girl :)|`|hgG9AaN2aa	I'm betting your just fine.
eFjy1f2paa	get some safewords set up - make sure that you have a "green" (More..!), yellow (Not so much), and Red (STOP) safeword.  That will allow her to let you know what she wants without seeming to control you.  You are supposed to be in control.<br>  <br>  Blindfold her.<br>  Use things on her body - a rose, a vibrator, and ice come to mind, but anything that will create a different sensation on her skin, brushes, silk, whatever.<br>  Do What she asks, but not When she asks - give her a few minutes.<br>  Add some level of intensity....  pinch her nipples... give a slap on her sex.<br>  Use oils on her... maybe some of that stuff that heats up...<br>  Use yourself on her... rub, tease... <br>  Oral - always fun.  But again, at your pace, teasing, tormenting.<br>  <br>  Experiment.  Read Penthouse letters.  mostly - Have Fun|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Tie her up and ask her what she wants you to do with her. She will tell you.|`|mCM363I9aa	well, use your imagination. What would you want her to do to you if you were the one tied down?|`|RKhSRMlZaa	ASK her, duh!|`|Vw8GdpxLaa	That is what she is wanting.Take charge and take away her control. She is looking for you to handle your business is the bedroom. Not saying that with any disrespect at all. That is experience talking. Make sure you have a code word though. That is important. Because in this game no does not mean no. She wants you to do things to her that you see in the movies not the same old boring things you do every time. Use whipped cream and warming oils to get the party started. Don't forget to go to the toy store and buy some extra things. Reach for the moon here and blow her away. |`|pma90Xycaa	That one you'll honestly have to play by ear.  What works well for me might not work well for your wife.  So tell her beforehand that you guys need to have little codewords during your...session.  Have one word for good and another word for bad.  That way she doesn't put you down by saying, "Eow, no.  I HATE that!"  The whole purpose of having her tied down is that you're in command...but you need some help from her as far as what is good and what is bad.  Remember, not all women are created sexually equal.|`|kIYjXoCAaa	Tie her up and then blindfold her....do what you would normally do when she isnt tied and blindfolded.  Kiss her in spots you dont normally kiss her in...and she wont be able to move or see you....SEXY!!!!|`|AA12250380	Pretend you are a bandit and you have abducted her. You oder her to take her clothes off. She begs for merci cries no,no, but you go on strip her and rape her... repeatedly. You lucky man !|`|hmlggYi6aa	Tie her up and take care of your dreams with her anything she told you no about do it.|`|ccSepzgcaa	So you've never consummated your marriage before? This can't be a legit. question.|`|AA10240683	You could pleasure her using your mouth, for starters.|`|AA11657908	Try a Google search on "bondage." You'll get lots of results to give you ideas.|`|alParLLNaa	Turn on the TV and make her watch PBS. That will solve your problem. I bet she will never ask you to tie her up again and you won't have to worry about "what to do next".<br>  <br>  Just kidding!<br>  <br>  She is obviously allowing you to take control. DON'T SCREW THIS UP!<br>  You should do everything that you can possible think of to cause her to have the most enjoyable orgasm of her natural life. This is your chance to try those things that you have been thinking about. Just make sure that you understand that when a woman ask you to tie her up, that is not for you! It is for her pleasure. You should get pleasure from giving her pleasure. Once she has completely climaxed to the max, then she can satisfy you. You should know what she wants better than us. If you have any more doubts about what you should do next, just call up one of her ex-boyfriends and ask him what he would do. Better yet, just ask him to come over and do it for you.|`|UEFHQhI8aa	If you're going to start those kind of games just make sure you organise a safety word first. Something very specific like 'Tuna' or 'Watermelon'. That way if either of you want to stop there wont be any misunderstandings.<br>  As far as what to do... tease tease tease. Women love foreplay. We can be like cars. The longer you warm us up, the better. If you're not using a gag ask her to tell you what to do and she'll steer you in the right direction.|`|AA10040956	She just wants some spice in what you do.  If she doesn't complain about what you do then do it while she is tied up.   Tease her a little though.<br>  <br>  Sounds like she is freaky.  Go with it man.  You have a treasure and don't even know what to do with it.|`|hPgRvmTUaa	Me too! Never could understand this thing. Most women want to be free to talk and spend money and talk and spend money and talk and spend money and talk and spend money.... then they want to be tied up with a rope!!!!!! Don't know.......... can't figure it out. |`|VriChiqGaa	once shes tied up use your imagination do wot you want some thing that uve always wanted to do and never gonna get the chance to do again coz she ain't gonna like it and shell never let you tie her again.haha|`|P8nveBfbaa	Do what feels right. If she has giving you the Green light to tie her up, then take your mind to the freakiest level an please her all night long.|`|YW9ouYhQaa	After you tie her up. get you car keys and go out with your friends, maybe watch a game or a movie. bet you she will never ask for it again =)|`|PTyYSdxbaa	Oh come on, use your imagination! lol. Better yet, use your tongue, tease her for a while until she can't stand it anymore. I think you know the rest. |`|fXzed3fLaa	Tease her until she can not take it anymore, then treat her like the dirty little wife she is.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Don't use rope, neck ties are softer.What does she want you to tie her up for than?  Ask her what she wants.|`|eEbqfYUTaa	ask her the reason why...tell her to be calm if shes reallz insisting let her tie herself ..have concsience|`|3A22UX22aa	Tickle her til she pees all over, then spank her for making a mess.|`|QyFOFgW7aa	Get a leather slipper and beat her all over the head... She'll never ask stupid questions like that again.|`|AA11496527	Throw her in the pool, and then go have a beer:)|`|a4fdffa57f30442c8d9c2d6391d78f4baa	Go out with your mates for a few beers|`|X6C6kZKKaa	that is the idea. what ever goes. get it?|`|hYRUlJGaaa	Spank her behind good and hard!|`|uvyW6R6Aaa	uhmmm I dunno, go watch "The Hills Have Eyes"|`|lvOafYB1aa	Leave the room, I'll keep my eye on her for you.|`|MU0EylAaaa	just throw her in a pool|`|lyWSufFBaa	LOL...do the same things you would do to her if she wasn't tied up. |`|VSVQHKwKaa	Tease her, touch her, talk to her with gentle mockery.<br>  <br>  Remember, she wants to be tied up so she has no control. So, now you can do anything you want (within reason) to her. She wants you to take advantage of her. You need a diagram?
RL9wZs3Iaa	Well, by the sounds of it, you are looking for a Mr. Perfect; this is unrealistic. If you want a boyfriend so bad, you will most definitely need to sacrifice one of your expectations. Seeing as I don't know you I have to ask what is wrong with the nerds, as you have a clear problem with players. If are tired of the player type, try exploring the other end of the spectrum. Just a thought.|`|jJZFShbeaa	your not unrealistic. the best thing to do is stop looking and they will run to you!

You can really hurt someone, hurt the relationship, or even end up in jail if it's done wrong.|`|OG4410bdaa	those who practice S&M should have a safe word<br>  (like when my husband and I play rough, we use the word "gorilla")<br>  <br>  it does not turn into domestic abuse until the safe word is ignored<br>  if the safe word is never used then it is consentual|`|5r2Csdzwaa	I'll strip you down and strip me.

I don't think I would be on here bragging about how I love S&M if I were a young lady.  Okay these people are SICK THAT PRACTICE S&M.|`|l6eBtko7aa	I draw the line at mutilation. Binding, whipping, and all that are fine. I will not mutilate my body for sexual purposes though. However, I have nothing wrong with other people doing it.

W5vEu6Ckaa	Hi! :)<br>  <br>  Lol, you're not exactly what i would call being "stalked" by a girl, but it is an oddly peculiar way for her to tell you that she likes you. (you know she likes you right? cuz if u didn't, she does!) She text's you everyday because she has a crush on you, and she hangs up on you when you answer her calls because she's trying to play tricks on you. Kinda like how some boys act when they like a girl, stupid. Lol, just don't get too annoyed because you know she's only doing it out of love, not just out of annoyance. Why don't you talk to her in person and tell her to stop texting you in a subtle way, like make up an excuse and say that you guys have different service providers and you don't have unlimited texting so it costs money and then you can give her an alternative, like IMing.<br>  <br>  The conversation could go something like this:<br>  <br>  YOU: "(her name here), you know how you text me alot?" <br>  HER: "Yeah?"<br>  YOU: "Well I wanted to know if you could text me a little less because we have different service providers and I don't have unlimited texting so it costs alot of money if you text too much."<br>  HER: "Oh, ok."<br>  YOU: "Why don't we IM instead? It's quicker than texting anyway."<br>  HER: (a smile will light up on her face) "Ok." <br>  <br>  Don't worry about hurting her feelings because if the conversation goes something like that ^ you really can't hurt her. (unless you don't care about hurting her feelings and you want her to go away forever, then you can just blow her off.) <which isn't very nice, but it is an alternative.. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped you somewhat, and just remember to try to let the girl down easily. Take care, -Maddy :)|`|WriYeGrbaa	Why dont you take her out or meet her somewhere.. Then be so annoying and the complete opposite of why she likes you..

B6cOlFU9aa	Wow it sounds like you have been through a lot of emotional turmoil with your dad in such a short amount of time. These are the kinds of things that kids write off their parents for, and you have a right to be upset. <br>  <br>  Since you said that your dad wasn't raised in an affectionate family, this may not totally be his fault. Parents usually raise their kids the way they were raised, even if they know how awful it was. This is the feeling i get about your dad, he doesn't know how else to treat you. Also, most dad's don't show their affection like mom's do.<br>  <br>  Your dad seems to be treating your whole family pretty badly, and it's not your duty to stand up for yourself and make your dad treat you better, it is your mom's. I suspect your mom shares some of your fears of your dad. She should be the one standing up to him and protecting you and your sister. <br>  <br>  Would it be possible to sit down with your dad and explain to him how you feel? He might be more understanding than you think, but you know your dad, and if this wouldn't help, then you should talk to your mom. Explain to her how scared you are of your dad and how he is really bringing you down all the time. She might be able to get through to him.<br>  <br>  Just because you are a parent doesn't mean you automatically become nice or caring, and if it turns out that your dad really is just belittling and mean, then I am very sorry and I wish I could help. Some people just can't be changed, and I just hope that your dad will change, because you deserve to be treated a lot better.|`|1LdgTQodaa	hi.i am sorry to hear about how things are for you.i am 26 and have five kids and it is difficult ,sometimes you do shout at your kids when things happen ,but it sounds to me like your dad does have anger issues.a lot of people do.i would never have a go at my children for damaging something by accident in the way you described that your father did.he has obviously been like this for many years. he definatley sounds like he can be quite aggresive sometimes in the way he deals with things.but if things have been like this for this long then im not sure theres much you can do to change how he is.some people just get stuck in a way of doing things and life goes on for years in the same way with everyone arguing and its just like a big circle going round and round.<br>  if you really are scared of your father when hes behaving like this ,you should speak to mum and let her know how you feel ,because you are a child still and you shouldnt be made to feel ike this in your own home.it should be somewhere you feel safe and you should be able to speak to your parents.<br>  when i was your age my parents didnt used to hug me or anything like that ,they never had done because they werent brought up doing it,but they did everything else for me as i was growing up and i dont feel anything against them because they didnt do it.some people just dont feel comfortable doing it.but that is no escuse to treat people in that way.why dont you try and speak to him"if you think you could ,and let him know how you feel".im sure if he heard how he made you feel it would certainly give him a bit of a shock and he might start to look at things from your point of view.and get him to realise that if something happens it doesnt always have to turn into a big argument because nothing is that important.i hope i have helped .and good luck|`|3vrMJqoPaa	Well you should talk to him about how you feel. If you really dont think <br>  that you can do that then try talking to your mom or someone that is <br>  close to you. Your really should talk to someone  about how you feel.  and you dont sound like a physcopathe i understand and this is a serious thing|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	We usually learn to "parent" from the way our parents treated us.<br>  He was given no affection - so he does not know how. No one can really know how he feels on the inside.  I am sad for you that there is this distance between the two of you, but don't give up on him.  Accept the affection that he rarely shows and be happy about it.<br>  (Stop scratching yourself) Maybe he is giving all he has to give....<br>  Good luck to you (and your sister).|`|R6TFrDtxaa	I don't even know where to start. Go to a counselor at your school and ask for help. There is nothing wrong with you, but you need help understanding your fathers ways. Good Luck!|`|X5pFnRZpaa	Im 14 too but my dad is not like that at all. If he got mistreated as a child he thinks thats right to disipline too hard on a child. My dad got hugged all the time and got given money and stuff so he is like that to me and my brothers. And yes i did read through this all LOL. I think maybe you should tell your mum how you feel about your dad and she might speak to him. Your mum will understand and she will talk some sense into your dad. And do not scratch your wrist because if you start doing that now you will end up using knives and kill yourself!<br>  <br>  good luck xx|`|qJTS4WBoaa	Sweetie, I'm not giving your dad an excuse or a reason but it sounds like that maybe he could be stressed out at work and he takes it out on you and the family. Being only 14 yrs old, the best thing, and probably only thing you can do is just try to stay out of his way, especially when he's angry.|`|ufdFei1jaa	You want to love him yet you cannot because he is unpredictable. Your dad needs help with his problems , and until that happens I feel he may always be like this. Talk to your mother about your fears and see what happens. Do NOT confront your father.|`|0KgrjTgtaa	It sounds like your dad just doesn't know how to show his affection. He just kinda assumes that you know he loves you, so doesn't really think about showing it.<br>  <br>  As for the shouting and stuff, some people are prone to over-reaction, or are just angrier in general than other people. My dad is like this, and i'm still trying to work out how to deal with it, but for you the first step would be just to talk to him about it and tell him all of this. He probably doesn't even realise what he's doing.<br>  <br>  And the hitting - is it just like a slap on the leg like a lot of old fashioned parents deal out or was it like proper domestic violence level? Because there's a big difference.|`|3RRqrtFNaa	i know how you feel my mom was the same way. i would tell your mum how you feel and then tell your dad together. you are 14 and in a short 4 years you will be out on your own. you need to stand up for yourself. tell him you are sick of this and if he continues to treat you like this then you simply won't acknowledge or allow him anymore. tell him you want to mend your relationship but he has to change. and remember that you are a kid still and kids usually only see there side so try looking through his eyes a little. and also a relationship can't work unless you both bend to fit the pieces together. good luck|`|Nqua2QJJaa	well i dnt realy like my dad either, he is annoying and just talks to me like a piece of crap. He was watching tv the other day and sent me out the room when i only said whas the time? what did i do wrong? nothing! ugh! they are so annoying, dnt worry, ur not the only teen who has a HORRIBLE father!|`|YwexxPaXaa	I don't think it's childish at all, you have a right to be scared of him. I hate my dad because when I was little he was abusive to wards my mum, he only ever shouted at me and I don't live with him anymore but I hate him SO much but obviously he is my dad so I kinda love him? I guess it makes sense because children want to impress their parents and be loved and admired by them. I guess when I see my dad on boxing day {the only day a year I see him} if he does something even a little nice I think he's great and I forget why my mum left him. I guess everyone want's two parents who love them and each other. It's not your fault though. I can't stand my dad hugging me... You aren't a psychopath, and you shouldn't feel nothing you do is good enough, maybe its not good enough for him but its still good enough for other people. I can't do anything right =P But don't scratch yourself, you're not to blame and it sounds like your dad could have a mental disorder I guess. I know this doesn't really help but I just felt like talking to someone =]|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	I think you do love him deep down but are just finding it hard to forget stuff tht happened with him and you in the past and now you see it happening to your little sister it is bringin back those memories even more. I think you do like him and thats why when he is nice to you you feel happy yet also scared coz u r not sure if he is suddendly going to turn on you. Maybe you should speak to your mum about it?|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	I'm sorry you feel like this.<br>  To me, it sounds like your father has anger problems, and he doesnt know how to resolve his anger, apart from shouting and/or hitting.  am ot surprised you are afraid of him. Childhood has a huge effect on how you grow up, and the emotions you feel around certain people. Your father shouted and hit you regularly during childhood, it seems, so that is having an effect on you now, some years on. The way you feel is to be expected, and the way he acted was and still is, wrong. I think family therapy and counselling, or even CBT would help your father to keep his anger in check, because obviously, he is in need of help. It may not just be anger problems either, he could have another type of mental problem, for example bi-polar, but Im not entirely sure, as it doesnt sound like he has extreme highs and then lows. <br>  Have you talked to your mom about this and about how you feel? You sound really close, and it would take a great weight off your shoulders, and perhaps help you if you told her. It would benefit your little sister too, as you dont want her growing up to be scared of your father too. Talk to someone you trust, and hopefully, this can all be resolved. Your father does love you deep down, and Im sure you love him too. Its just difficult for some people to express their love. You dont necessarily want to like him, but I believe, in your heart you love him. If you dont want a strong relationship with him, that is entirely up to you, and is understandable if you dont. Try listening to music, or taking a bath, because it will help you relax and hopefully stop you taking your hurt out on yourself. <br>  I really hope everything gets better!<br>  <br>  ? CupCake ?|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	My dad is somewhat like that. Gets angry about little things, so negative etc. And he also doesn't hug me either because of how he was just raised. I think your dad just normally has a personality where he's short tempered and isn't that comfortable showing his soft side. I think I would just tell myself that it's just how he is and it's not because he hates you or anything like that. It could be the way that he was raised.|`|PTshTOSUaa	id be terrified too, id try to tell my mom and go live with a relative. hitting is not ok. and flipping out over little stuff wow. im sorry you had to go through this. im 22 now and ive fought with my dad before. if i get mad at him i yell and he yells back but i think my parents hit me once when i was little and tht was the end of tht. so try to stand up for urself and if u feel ur in danger call the cops.|`|ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	Thank you for sharing this with us, i can understand exactly how you feel, what you want from your father is true constant love, at the moment, you can not rely on his reactions, when he does display his love to you, you are scared, it is precious and does not last long, you embrace it and want it last, what upsets you is that, one minute he can make you feel so loved and the next you are his worst enemy, i think you hit the nail on the head when you spoke about his upbringing, he has a problem showing love because he wasn't shown it when he was younger. He knows the error of his ways and by the way that he does display his love for you sometimes, i would think he is fighting hard against his bad nature. Next time he shouts, do not rise to the bait, do not answer him back, if you have to say something, then say something like, but i know you love me really daddy, that should ease his anger and calm the situation. Normally he would expect a row with you, this way, it will defuse the situation. Just accept, your father's upbringing was not his fault, he does try to make the effort with you, and you know that he does love you really, so when he feels that he has to shout, just accept it, don't fight back, just do as he says, and get through the situation as calmly as possible, take care|`|vZMN82U8aa	i recognise your dad in myself... and i had a similar upbringing... as did my parents... <br>  <br>  dont hink badly of your dad, he's the only one yo have, and will ever want, just give him some slack... some dads arent all touchy feely, we arent soft walters.. we are old fashioned men, thats all...  <br>  <br>  we come from an age where kids were seen and NOT heard...no, not a peep! or we'd get whacked... back in the day when beating teh crap out of your kids was acceptable... and condoned... <br>  <br>  so, if you want things to change youll have to sit him down, and tell him, to his face, because until you do, things will stay the same... <br>  <br>  and although he may not show it, ill bet you kids are the love of his life... he feeds you, clothes you and puts a roof over your head... if he didnt love you, he'd see that as a waste of money, and he'd be gone like the wind... but hes hasnt has he, and he wont... <br>  <br>  and when was the last time someone cuddled dad?

I don't think that i have once missed soccer am lol.<br>  <br>  erm i guess you could record the footie go out with him and watch it when you get back or watch highlights on your phone. He can not expect you to just give up football as it is addictive.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|1k7pcUHkaa	Football.<br>  I could never give up football. But im not like you. I wouldnt stay in just because my team is playing. I would only if i had nothing else to do. But if i did, i would watch the repeat at night. :)|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Ditch him - there must be gazillions of football loving guys who would love you and treat you sooo much better than this control freak!<br>  <br>  He's doing it deliberately you know - makes him feel good!|`|LackW92zaa	I think you should offer him an alternative night to go out, like nights besides football nights. Ask him if he'd like to go out on different days, and just do what he wants (with you in mind as well though). If he continues being fussy and controlling (which is what it sounds like to me) then he's not that great of a guy. Just try to work out different days.|`|37f6229a93979bffb2fac8eaf2c56ab4aa	Its your life & relationships are about give & take,if he wants to be so controlling about your love of football what else will he decide to be controlling about,maybe this guy is not for you.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	you have your hobbies - he has his. <br>  <br>  if he was a man, you'd have to just accept it because society demands that men must have "football" time.<br>  <br>  I'm a girl and love my footie, my BF doesn't but hey - ce la vie! <br>  <br>  Three years is a long time to be together - he's got to have other reasons for being annoyed for no reason - is he using this as a smoke screen? is he into someone else?<br>  <br>  most guys would kill for a girl that loves football.<br>  <br>  Don't let a guy change who you are, however he makes you feel.<br>  <br>  look after yourself and stand your ground!
inw5scIkaa	First of all... Did she take into consideration how she would make you feel when she lied?<br>  <br>  So don't worry about making her mad. You are not the one that did the wrong thing and you are suffering for it.<br>  <br>  Tell her how you feel, as in "I feel lied to". And ask her why...<br>  <br>  Really though, if she is lying all the time, she's really not worth hanging around, is she? She's really not much of a "friend" either, is she?
N7mgfDxnaa	she lying. i mean, if he's comparing you two, theres obviously something not right with them. so i think shes lying to keep up appearances.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	um its hard 2 tel n i think bob mit lyk u so try not 2 send that many..|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Dont think it really matters who is lying here, thing u should be most worried about is hwy is your bf showing is mate pics of you in your underwear!?!? He has no respect for you, what so ever in my opinion|`|6kAtYLAdaa	hmmmm.... maybe the girl doesnt send him pictures and she just felt out of the loop cuz you do so she lied.  it happens.  id be more pissed that my bf was showing his friends my pictures.|`|f17RMVa3aa	i bet she was just lying just to sound superior because wouldnt he brag that he had her picture?|`|9Ni21lHpaa	why do u care what either karry or bobs do?its their relationship,dont care about what they do or say and dont bother repeating that piece of info to ure friend...shes gonna be pissed that her bf's been looking at ure pix.(Btw Karry's got more self respect if she doesnt send him pix of herself in her underwear)ure boy frank doesnt look like a trustworthy guy AT ALL(and neither does bobs for that matter)u are working ureself in a very tight corner girl,cuz if u want out of ure present relationship..or if something goes wrong....how do u know that there wont be pix of you in ure underwear all over the net??frank and bobs just ogle ure pix?dont u think that's sick?werent they meant 4 ure bf's eyes only?does this guy find nothing at all about you worthwhile than keeping and requesting underwear pix....???Doesnt seem to respect you as a person does he???what mindframe are you in?|`|489ff00b77050c22e42691ee478ab3dfaa	Wow, your friends, boyfriends and you have really  messed up relationships.

BbaR8Hhqaa	you should let him be for the weekend. let him think about what all happened this week.  if he still does on monday, talk to him. if he wont talk to you about it, slip him a note.|`|iuTn6OwSaa	Leave him, he is just sad. It will all work out, and he will talk to you when he is ready. If you try to talk to him now, he may just ignore you and not want to talk later.|`|AA10410277	just leave him alone for now . then when you think he's feeling better try talking to him.|`|yPKrBiIhaa	i think u shuld leave him alone he'll get over it|`|BsK3u5p3aa	people always wanna be superman. honey u cant fix any problem u can only make people feel better. the only thing that fixes things is time n sometimes THAT dont even fix it. so juss give him some time heal and if he acts like he doesnt wanna be bothered, then dont bother him before he says somethin to hurt ur feelins ok? its good to try to make people feel better but sometimes people dont look at it the same way as you. he juss need time. if he really wants ur help, he'll ask n if he dont, he's probably afraid to ask for help, so juss wait it out a little ok?|`|HHD6nXJQaa	If he is sitting in a corner or just sitting there depressed just put your arm around him and try to talk with him. Just try to be comforting to him when he is down. Talk things out with him.<br>  <br>  When someone is depressed those things always help. Just be there for him.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	try no to b askin him stuf bcus he knos u lyk him n he will think that u really lyk him n that could make it really awkward|`|MlCWsBcwaa	I don't know if you can fix this, but can understand why you are worried.  You don't know for sure what the problem is though, do you?  Maybe something else entirely is what is worrying him, and you can't fix that and aren't part of the problem.  My suggestion would be to contact one of his best mates and tell him what you are worried about.  If they can't get somewhere with this guy, maybe they know his parents and can talk to them if there is something wrong.  Next time this happens, maybe it would be a good idea not to wait until after the day is over to get his best mates to go and talk to him.  Good luck.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	he's depressed coz of your friend. he got shut down and there's nothing you can do. just cheer him up or something but don't throw yourself to him.|`|ClNwOkq8aa	Yes i would wait until monday. If he's still depressed totally talk to him! Be his comforter!|`|RpsLJNzVaa	give him a hug. LOL. That might work|`|0eorp2Hhaa	leave him be for now to repair himself
sLWC6vEmaa	Unfortunately its really hard to change a guy and another thing... he is probably addicted so that makes it even harder ...<br>  <br>  if you want to talk to him though just go up to him and try to start a conversation and try to find common interests|`|juMy8eHraa	idk about the rest but i lived wih my bro he use to smoke pot well if hes high he laughs easy he looks like he keeps zoning and he will look around like he sees something but mainly zoned|`|b5QWb0Fgaa	what kind does he have any good ones? jk sounds like he's not for you and you are not the one to "help" him|`|wdFwirb4aa	Wow, this sounds like me.. I liked a guy that did some drugs, but I knew that he was a good guy. Now he's moved to another town. It sucks, but I heard that know he is playing sports (unlike him) and he's probably off the drugs now. <br>  <br>  I say, talk to him.. you don't want him to be completely out of your reach. Ask him, why do you them anyways? Try not to sound too serious though.
aXYiOskmaa	i understand you mom's point. always finish what you start. is there any special reason you hate swimming this year? has something happened? also, what's made your grades go down? certainly it can't be just because you don't like the swim team. perhaps you should figure out these things before quitting. talk to your guidance counselor, perhaps he/she can help you.|`|htaxf1jJaa	just talk to your mom about it. tell her your side of the story...how that you do enjoy swimming but you just don't wanna do it for school anymore and that your grades have been going down ever since you started this year. grades are more important than sports, so just talk to her and i'm sure she'll listen.|`|UlXZdcW7aa	Sorry to say this this but you have slacked all year and cant it do right, put your nose to the stone, get with it you can do this, all of it, swimming, grades, just a walk in the park, this is the point in life where you get respect if you can pull this off|`|z4Pcc5fcaa	Fail your classes and have a baby now.

But my Dad forgave her and they are slowly building their relationship again. You shouldn't worry about your parents relationship with each other so much, easier said than done but this is coming from someone who knows what you're going through! <br>  <br>  Always know that both will always love you and your siblings, you are their children and that could never change. Be happy that they want to try again and means sticking to their vows and having a second chance. Think of the good things that can come with a move (I've moved in three continents in various cities, over seas...) and going to a big city. More opportunities and to strengthen your parents bond together if he was mostly in Arizona...hard to believe, but parents, adults are human too and get lonely. Long distance relationships don't work. Also, keep all your friends in contact on the internet and phone calls and see if you can visit now and then in the summer, that's the advantage for you for still living in the same country. <br>  <br>  Good luck, God bless.|`|UlXZdcW7aa	That's one question nobody can answer, Your mom has control and do what she likes|`|BFlWWhfSaa	I heard cutting yourself was the style these days|`|NQ2sZku0aa	think of the bright sides for moving and be happy for ur parents|`|ruTBbmfXaa	you really cant stop what ur mom says. its really not up to u. just tell her how much u like it in florida. and tell her that you dont want to move. i tried. i doubt it will work because whatever moms say always goes. maybe ur mom wants to start fresh or something, open a new page in her life. hope u understand.   :]|`|AA10531094	Sorry to inform you that it's not up to you.  It's your mother's decision and you and your siblings are minors and have to do what you're told.  Change is always hard because you never no how things will turnout.

I ended up being sick that day, but could've went and been perfectly fine. My friend doesn't have a phone, so I left her a message letting her know I didn't want to come, and was feeling a bit sick anyways.<br>  <br>  Telling the truth is hard, but it's always better than making up excuses. Sure, I'm guilty of making up excuses. Telling someone you 'just didn't want to go' is hard.<br>  <br>  There's other times when somethings DOES come up, and the person wants to know why you won't be there. I explain what came up, and usually try to make it up to them. "I'll be there next time, I will!" "I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you, okay?"<br>  <br>  If it gets to the point where you just can't stand it, bring it up. "I'd really appreciate it if you guys would lay off with the questions. I like having my privacy."<br>  <br>  They might be a little hurt, but you're getting your true feelings out there, and they might just stop asking questions.<br>  <br>  Whatever you end up doing, good luck to you! :)

HbZPhi98aa	well im not a skater lol but i like a women that is smart funny nice understanding loyal caring beutiful has a sense of style real not a s-lut and respects herself!
pE5E5L5naa	Well first thing, you should explain how much ur mom is going through and the family is suffering. ur mom has to support the whole family by herself. tell ur sister to think about it, what if she was in her mom's position? you work hard everyday and when you come back home just hoping for a peaceful evening, you get insulted by ur own daughter? i think it's right that you have struck her. but you should explain to her whats everyone going through first and why you struck her, try not to get too rough up about it she only nine. i feel sorry for you. when this is over you guys should try to lighten your mom's load. goodluck anyways. =). btw plz do not spank you back lol.|`|69fa948353d1dbf575b7e1dd974f6570aa	she deserved it. But if you feel that guilty then I guess you can let her spank you if you want but that seems weird.and no you weren't harsh.|`|Pi2jc5kZaa	You shouldn't have spanked her, that's for sure. Go apologize for spanking her and never do it again so she will believe you. But you were right for taking her somewhere private and telling her to apologize to your mother, that was an awful thing to say and would've done the same (we're the same age and got same age sisters!) When you apologize, remember to tell her again to never call your mom such an ugly and hurtful word again, b/c she loves her and does all she can for her to be happy. It's called being  ungrateful.<br>  <br>  Help your mom out everyday, pray for her, the family and yourself. Be good to your sister, good luck.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	The real questions maybe should be<br>  <br>  WHY did your mom not let your 9 year old sib. have pudding?  Maybe your mom didn't have time to make pudding?  Maybe your 9 year old sib's 16 year old sister could have made pudding for the "family" for supper?<br>  <br>  Is your sister accustomed to calling mom such uncouth names? Has it been explained to her WHY she shouldn't? Has she been warned of consequences in the future?<br>  <br>  You spanked with your hand?  As long as it clearly was for what she said, what she called mom, I can't see anything wrong with it .. though it might have been a bit too hard ... for it to hurt "for a few hours".<br>  <br>  So you want the two of you (or the three of you) to be "even"???<br>  Did she deserve to be spanked? Then you shouldn't feel guilty or anything. IF you realize, after, that it was a bit overly harsh, you could apologize for THAT aspect of the spanking. BUT that should end it.<br>  .|`|aXYiOskmaa	well, it's not your place to spank your sister however, making her apologize was the right thing to do. it sounds like your mom is having a really rough time right now and just doesn't have any fight left in her. i can totally understand that. try helping your mom out a bit. take some of the work off of her and lighten her load. give her time and she'll some around again.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	I don't think your sister will show disrespect to your mom again, at least not in front of you, if she does, take her to another room and talk to her.  No, don't have your sis. spank you back that just validates her behavior, what's done is done.|`|en74VE9uaa	no i think it was the right thing to do. as long as it wasnt hard.|`|JUEkTETAaa	no ...because if she does not respect your mom who will she respect|`|szH3qJ7Iaa	no bc what she did was very hurtful to your mom. she shouldnt even be talking like that at 9! ;p
qMsWcfNXaa	sounds like a player, and i think he wants to be the one in charge of the relationship, hes being a guy and a cocky one. I say tell him how u feel and talk over how he isn't spending time with u and if he doesn't change than i say dump him. But talk it over|`|tEKD8mX2aa	yes talk to him and tell him that ur feeling neglected and if he doesn't give you more attention that you're going to get it from someone else|`|d922d8a0409a4a04d2023991a654551aaa	He's using you. Dump him and move on. Being single is better than being treated like a fool.|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	If u feel he is telling lie to u. Leave him for a while, see what will he do? It will be clear if u r important to him or no. Do the same when he wants to see u or u r supposed to be together say u dont have time, u wanna go out shopping with a friend, u wanna visit a friend or go out with friends etc. Let it be long.Look what will happen. If he insist ofcourse for just to be with u not for se*. Maybe if he loves u he needs to be reminded and he is drawn to routines and got bored. Any way u will understand it from his reaction then.|`|2sgYribSaa	Girl leave him and find yourself a more mature man!

d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Well mate, Stalking is out of the question because when you live so close it takes all the fun out of getting caught and sent up the river for many years, so DONT!!. Flowers usually work saying that she has a secret admirer and hope she doesn't flip out. Casually walking by her and having your friend "accidentally" bump you into her and knocking something out of her hand. You can bend down before she does and pick the item up for her.  Remember to smile your best smile and start up a conversation.  Get rid of the I am so shy routine that we guys know is a put on to get the sympathy vote. Be confident and if she doesn't have a huge football player bf, you can drop him if he confronts you.  Dude I wish you the best of luck, I was there once and now I have that guys ex gf now|`|H2tkkWyPaa	You just need to talk to her, or else it will always be awkward, and then you should probably invite her on a group date or something first, just so it's harder to get awkward, you know? I would just try to get to know her.|`|AA10648665	Ok you know she smokes. Does she go to the same place to smoke? Start going there yourself. If you can work out the times she goes, she and you should turn up there at the same time eventually. Then you can ask for a light or something. And say 'i've met you before, with my friend. Hi, I'm ....' Then just 'run into' her a few times and say hi.|`|IlPsFSUHaa	mayeb smoking isnt the best idea to imply u care about her bcuz its hazardous to her health. but first just plan a little thing with some of your friends and invite her and then if you have a good time then keep doing it until she decides she wants to be alone with you|`|0JYaYVylaa	Next time u see her out in public, don't be shy go introduce yourself tell her ur name and dont come on to strong u dont want her to think ur a creeper.Become friends with her but not too good of friends ever heard of the "friend zone" oh ya its real.

TCpTlCTRaa	My husband was very loving and supportive. I lost almost all of my hair when I was 32 years old. I felt ugly and unattractive but my husband did not feel that way about me. I used aromatherapy essential oil formulas to grow all my hair back and I still use them when my hair starts to thin.|`|ZTRakv6maa	you too? i wear a hat alot. my husband doesnt say anything about it.|`|Z77TyAVEaa	I will be supportive and help her get treatment. <br>  <br>  What to think about: <br>  <br>  How successful your treatment is depends on your expectations and the cause of hair loss. Treatment for hair loss caused by an illness, medication, or damage to the hair usually is more successful than treatment for inherited hair loss.<br>  <br>  Considerations about inherited hair loss include:<br>  <br>  The cost. Medication or surgery to treat hair loss can be expensive and often is not covered by insurance. <br>  Length of treatment. Medications must be taken continuously or the regrown or thickened hair will fall out. Surgery can be lengthy, and in most cases you will need several surgeries to achieve the coverage you want. <br>  Side effects. Long-term effects of some hair loss medications are not known. <br>  <br>  Type of treatment. Medications that must be taken continuously can be expensive and can increase the chance of side effects. Surgery, which may be a more permanent solution, is also expensive. In addition, surgery involves risks and the chance that not all hair follicles will remain healthy. <br>  Women with inherited hair loss who wish to take birth control pills should use a pill type that does not add to hair loss, such as a norgestimate or ethynodiol diacetate|`|qsrlVSaaaa	Personally I married my wife because of who she is.

48W167cBaa	I still don't understand giving cheaters a 'second chance.' Sure, there have been times when things go all dandy afterwards, but I'm a firm believer in the 'cheated once, they'll cheat again.'<br>  <br>  I agree with you on using her best friend- very, very uncool. She really needs to let her ex go, for good. She should try things with her best friend- maybe things'll work out. <br>  <br>  If she ends up going with her ex and admitting everything to her best friend, she'll lose her best friend. If something happens between her and her ex again, she's out two people. Not a wise choice.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Sounds like she is pretty immature and needs to make h er own mistakes.. just be there for her no matter what she chooses and thats it.

VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,<br>  <br>  You know who was living in the 1950's?? <br>  <br>  A bunch of people who were born in the 1910's, 1920's, 1930's, 1940's and so on. There were people in the 50's whose father's and grandfathers fought in the civil war after all.<br>  <br>  You know what the condition of life was for unmarried people at that time?<br>  <br>  It was pretty awful. It could mean starvation in some cases. We had just been through two world wars where thousands of folks were killed or wounded, we had had a Great Depression, and we did not have nearly the kind of technology we have today.<br>  <br>  Getting married was not some personal preference thing like it is today. For the last 50 years (at that time), marriage was intimately connected to SURVIVAL!<br>  <br>  What if you broke a bone? What if you fell sick? What if typhoid killed off your whole family (not unheard of in 1890-1920)? <br>  <br>  You needed a married partner to handle LIFE!<br>  <br>  So when your professor is waxing poetic about how terrible it was to be single, tell him that to be single for the last 2000 years was a burden on your family at best, and potentially deadly at worst. <br>  <br>  There was a time, after all, that if a woman didn't have a child before 25....she wasn't likely to have one....PERIOD. Because 25 was middle-aged!<br>  <br>  People died in their mid 50's all the time!<br>  <br>  I hate it when ignorant teachers put MODERN slants on HISTORIC times.<br>  <br>  It's so contemptable.|`|igI5yX0vaa	So they wouldn't have sex outside of marriage.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Not as many females went to college and obtained careers or worked outside of the home.

VH4YeaZYaa	I am doing an online school. It is great but I will warn you, it can at times be lonely. But besides for that I prefer it. I would suggest Georgia Virtual Academy. Or whatever state you live in they have all states I think. But it is the same program. If you are responsible and reliable then you can pretty much do your school on your own. Your mom will just have to contact your teacher every once in a while. ( yes you have a real teacher that you will contact over something called a elluminate room) Anyways if you do become homeschooled then find a local homeschoole group to work with. I have 3 good friends who all homeschool and I go on field trips with them. It is great! You have to be commited though, or you will fall behind. Also get on the waiting list early if you start next year. The free cyber schools often quickly fill up. Good Luck bye!<br>  <br>  P.S, If you choose this school or want to check it out go to www.k12.com|`|tezNJNGKaa	You first have to prove to them you are responsible and can control yourself. This means doing what they tell you and more, doing chores, getting homework in, getting to school on time, all of that. <br>  <br>  However, some parents are against the idea completely. I know mine would just laugh at me if I asked them (: It's a brand new thing to them. You have to remember, your parents probably went to a VERY strict school and the thought of one on the internet is really, really strange.<br>  <br>  Just act as responsible as you can, then sit them down and talk to them seriously about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck! & if you DO get in, have fun for me too, lucky! :D

Sure there's harmless flirting, but who are we kidding? Our boyfriends flirt as well and are probably attracted to other people, but we're the ones they're with.<br>  Don't analyze or over think this situation, because it will get you in trouble. If this continues, then perhaps you should look deeper in it and find out if your happiness is beyond the attraction.|`|OYdIDTxCaa	yah, its normal to be attracted to someone even if they're a stranger. You've been going out with someone for a long time, and its okay to be attracted to someone other than your boyfriend, but it would be a bad idea to take it any further than talking if you would like to keep your boyfriend.<br>  and you're not doing anything wrong by talking to him. If you were to make out with him, or anything physical then it would be cheating.|`|AA10410277	probably just wanted something new.
jKQ5UAVWaa	You are not cheating at the moment but if you do meet up with the new guy things could happen and then you would be cheating. you have got to think about how you feel about your boyfriend. would you risk meeting up with the new guy and ruin your 5 year relationship? just put yourself in your boyfriends shoes. would you want him chatting to other women on the phone? just think about whether you love your boyfriend and if you care about him enough. good luck i hope you sort it out x|`|X9kUtwqSaa	Yes. Cheating necessarily doesn't have to be sexually. If you kiss him then your kind of cheating. But other then that I would consider it a hang out kind of thing. But you know how some people get really jealous? They think it's more then that so if you want to hang out with him aks your hubby how he feels about it.

mqNOmaJNaa	Boys like to be immature just to get a rise out of you!!  They tend to make a bid deal out of nothing just because they can.  If you like the boy don't let what they say bother you, it's hard but if you ignore them enough they will move on to something else that amuses them.|`|MgMsMExPaa	They are Just immature. try to get him to talk to you. maybe an email or phone so that the two of you can talk without being bothered by other people. Remember that if you do actually see him socially you will have to be friends with his friends at some point. Good luck|`|xwNgEhKCaa	HE LIKES YOU AND THEY NO IT|`|POHWTDPRaa	Because you let them. Ignore them and they'll get bored and frustrated by not getting a reaction and they will leave you alone.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	they're just probably trying to get you together.
Ukw1JUNcaa	I went through the same problem. The best way is just to sit down and talk to her; depending on her personality one of you can do it (if you feel as though all three of you talking to her about it would make her defensive and feel as though you were 'ganging up' on her) or you can all talk to her. I recommend the latter though, just because it allows more open communication.<br>  She also might be resentful that the two who didn't talk to her knew she had a problem but just didn't say anything. Just explain to her that it's very noticable that she doesn't shower and it's really affecting how everyone else is living. Most people don't like to know they smell bad and she could just be used to the smell. So once she finds out, she hopefully will make an effort to improve. I think you will be doing her a favor by letting her know... no one likes smelling bad and repelling possible relationships because of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Its time for an intervention... all of you should be there, so she knows that you all feel the same and she isn't being singled out. If you all tell her, she won't just assume you are just trying to be mean.|`|2LpWgU20aa	ive been in a similar situation so i know how u feel. how about for her birthday or just a regular day give her a gift basket filled with deodorents and shower gel and all the necesaties for good hygene. maybe then she will get the hint. if she doesnt use them as much as u would like her to, keep on dropping hints like saying "what is that smell?" and stuff like that. if she doesnt take hints well, when its just u and her nicely say "Can u shower more because u smell" then quickly change the subject to a less okward conversation so she doesnt think u are being a b**ch. Good luck! Afterall that if she refuses to practice proper hygene keep ur distance and spray perfume every time she passes.|`|1f93fe056a8941a67a5c0373d1ae4e0baa	Intervention. <br>  Get everyone that is her friend (or roommate) together<br>  Buy shower stuff that smells amazing, especially too her.<br>  Tell her about how it sickens everybody and shes not a kid, she needs to take care of herself better
W0633l18aa	I feel the same why as you do alot.<br>  <br>  Heres my answers:<br>  <br>  maybe you're not open to be cheered up, when I'm down even though people try and help sometimes I am not open to it and it doesnt work<br>  It maybe he finds it hard to comfort or doesn't know how to help you<br>  try and connect or bond with him over something this way you'll improve oyur relationship and feel closer so even if he doesnt cheer you up you'll still know he cares<br>  <br>  Parents are faulted, my parents yell at me too, what you have to realise sometimes they dont realise jut how muc httheir yelling hurts and sometimes they are jsut quick temepered people<br>  <br>  Your family might be sad due to a mixture of problems and the only thing you can do is try and spread the lvoe and look on the brightside, problems dont heal over night we have to try and solve them <br>  <br>  not everyone is as happy as they look, your cousins and friends may have their share of problems too but they look on the brightside and power through<br>  <br>  Why are oyu doing the same htings everyday? Coz you have school, like I do, and tis boring and stressful but life doesnt improve on its own - you have to try and make things better - join a club, I joined an exchange trip and even though it doesnt make everythign great it helps cheer me up. <br>  <br>  life is imperfect, you just have to look on the brightside and try and work past these problems. Try and talk to your mum and dad seriously, tell them you wish she'ld yell less and you dad you want to connect more. <br>  <br>  i wish i had some words that would fix it all coz i have felt like you feel so often, btu this is all i have, in the end the only one who can solve your problems is you, you just have to try do things that you want to do and show mroe patience and understanding to get through to your parents.<br>  <br>  gd luck

zQB0kEmcaa	Making friends can be difficult.  Just be yourself and try to get on with everyone.  Pick someone who you think you have alot in common with and hang out with her whenever possible.  I'm sure people don't hate you, that is a strong word to use, they probably just don't know you that well. Try to go out at the weekend with someone - don't judge your popularity on the amount of times you manage to get out in a week.  Make plans to meet up with people on a Saturday for eg to go see a movie perhaps.  It's better to go out once and have a really good time than to go out every eve and be bored.|`|44a64d66ad97997dc680dbbde4ead83faa	you can talk to me any time if your a girl text me  674 6748
AA11995584	Men do like commitment, just do not want that trapped control feeling. Because he is divorced there could still be some baggage there. My thought is this, tell him how you feel, no holding back, tell him you understand that people in relationships can have the same goals but move at different speeds and you are perfectly fine with that, but what you really want to know is if he and you see the same ending.  Tell him you are ok with a just for now relationship, but ultimately you do not want to emotionally invest in a dead end street. Once you have had your say, ask him to share what he thinks and SHUT UP and let him talk. Ask questions only for clarification. If you get the response that you want stick with him, if not move on 'cause he's just not that into you!|`|WKtakdsOaa	Not all men are like that.

I read you're last question you asked and I saw your boyfriend has been hurt in the past so I understand he's a little afraid of this.  I'm sorry you're going through this right now.

It's not always this hard though, honest !!|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Sometimes they are afraid that as soon as they settle then they will find someone (or something... ) better and it will be too late.

See how your life's been if maybe you've changed. Okay well I got to go talk to you later. Bye."<br>  <br>  Now I know that isn't the best way to start things off but I mean you could branch off of that. Just ask them how their life is if maybe their personality has changed at all. And if you keep talking to them for a while you should mention how mean they were to you. I mean you can say what ever you want your never going to see them again. And the worst thing they can do is send you mean messages but yet again you can report them to Facebook.LOl:P..<br>  Good luck and I mean this. I understand completely where your getting at.

If you want to stop you can, but if you keep on eating it just means you are happy that way so decide what you want to be ... thin or fat.|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	To me, it sounds like emotional eating.<br>  After a breakup, it is fairly common to turn to eating for comfort, to help your emotional needs.<br>  I would go see your GP, and they may be able to refer you to a counsellor, if you think you need one.<br>  If not, then just snack on fruits and vegetables, or whenever you feel like grabbing a snack or something to eat, just chew some gum, do some exercise, get out of the house.<br>  Hope it goes well for you!<br>  <br>  ? CupCake ?|`|qf0kuMCiaa	You worrying about your weight can cause you to gain weight it is from stress. Try chewing gum,walking or even phone a friend. Eat fruits and veggs when craving come on. Oh and if a guy only like you for your size then your with the wrong guy.
rRceaE4Maa	Awww, I am so sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I were you, I would cut off contact! Your father should not have kept in contact with this guy if he did this to his daughter! I am sorry, but he doesn't sound like a real father!!

I think you should contact the police or someone who can deal with this issue, before he assaults another child.|`|xzwZ3lt3aa	Troll. This isn't funny.
s0E6g5WTaa	First, congrats on your 19 years together!  I like the idea of trying to make it happen.  But be prepared that you'll probably fail at this most of the time in the beginning.  You'll have to try different things to introduce romance and excitement, but I think most men actually like when their wives take the initiative sometimes.  If you try to do something though and it doesn't work, don't get down on things right away - just be prepared to try the next thing out tomorrow.  Definately don't bring it up to him "you never want to ....... in a nagging kind of way" just move on to the next thing.  And eventually you'll have enough sucesses that you both will enjoy doing those new things together and soon new memories will be forged where he realizes "oh I can see this was a hidden part of me all along and she brought it out" making each of you view the other in a new light.  Then the relationship can grow in a more romantic direction.<br>  <br>  It's stifling to think you can't grow, but once you show him that it doesn't have to be that way, he will start having fun with it too.  Sounds like a lotta work I suppose, but if thats what you want thats how I would go about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LvTIVjySaa	Be really candid with him...cards on the table time.  Contrary to what you may believe, men are not over-thinkers like women.  They are much more A to B.  Hinting around and being subtle doesn't work for them.  Turn off the telly and the radio, sit down with full eye contact and tell him very plainly what you want from him and your relationship.  Be prepared to be specific in your requests and just talk to the man.  You will probably find that he wants to be closer to you too, but doesn't know what you want or how to give you what you need because no one has explained it to him.  Make plans together to do the things that both of you want to do and start experiencing quality time together.  Kiss him passionately, and tell him to want to start off by bathing him in the shower and attending to his every need, you want to show him why he made that vow 19 years ago, lead him by the hand and start having fun.|`|562qoBUUaa	Maybe he's just not big on 2 in the shower or dancing. Maybe try some other ways to get his attn...sexy lingerie, cooking a romantic dinner, writing him a cute poem, or rubbing his feet. These are all things men seem to enjoy. Good luck!|`|EPAxemybaa	well i have been married for 26 years and this used to be the problem, until one day i got my dog to finger me, and everything changed for the better.<br>  <br>  you should try it|`|AVDn7Imqaa	Married 22yrs. know what you mean. When and if we get the chance to get away is about the only time I see a little romance.<br>  <br>  Try taking off for the weekend or even just over night, sometimes a change in scenery helps.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Join the club, Michael....|`|H3WHxCgaaa	How much romance was there earlier in the marriage?  If you haven't had a romantic marriage all along - it isn't really going to change much now.  That said, you can try to enhance it...Don't ask - just do it!  Invite him to bed and break out some new toys - have a candlelit dinner waiting for him after work one day - "kidnap" him on a Saturday and take a day trip - whatever you consider romantic - try it!  Just remember - if he wasn't that guy before - he won't likely become Mr. Romance overnight...Good luck!  It's not easy keeping it alive over the passing of time...
Lpc2aAzRaa	sex complicates everrrrything...|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	Personally I think its cheap and degrading.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	As long as you are both honest and upfront with how you feel about it, then I say go for it. The only thing that would make it wrong was if one of you were leading the other person on, but that's not the case.<br>  <br>  Just be careful and have fun!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I don't think it's a good idea, wrong or not. It's really easy to get emotionally involved even when you know you shouldn't, and sex just does not equal love for guys. And if you "kinda" like him now, there would bee too much danger of you REALLY liking him once you've slept together. If you're going to do a friends with benefits thing Ii'd say go for someone who's physically attractive to you, but that you don't like. Just my opinion. :)|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It depends on what you want out of it.  Friends with benefits means you get to be his booty call whenever it's convenient.  Is that what you really want?  To be on standby for sex for when someone better doesn't come along that night?|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Nah.... get yourself a pokin'|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Your call, don't get pregnant or an STD.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It's not wrong to be friends with benefits, if both of you are aware this is not a relationship and you're just having sex. The problem for girls is that quite often they do get attached to the guy when having sex and sooner or later want to be more than just friends with benefits. Guys can separate love and sex, girls can't really do it....|`|OntO6wE4aa	Doesn't anybody have any moral thoughts going through their heads? Using your body as a dumping ground then when you want to be respected you have nothing to respect. The fad for to day is to be a sexual benefit. Too many risk with that behavior. Who ever you team up with that way has no commitment to you. Meaning he can go out and have dirty sex with any one and then bring what ever he caught back to you. Have more going for yourself than being a thing. Life is more exciting than that. Oh we'll be one on one. Ok. Who brakes it off? What if the other doesn't want to. It could get crazy. Want more for yourself. If you don't right now, then wait. Think. good luck|`|M627my7Baa	I think it's wrong for YOU to have a friend with benefits. Anyone who would ask this on Yahoo Answers is NOT ready. This should be completely between you and him, and no one else's opinion should matter one bit. When you reach THAT point, go for it.|`|nDHyeDVoaa	I think the best rule of thumb is... if you get preggers accidentally, could you live with him in your life FOREVER if you keep the baby? If yes, go for it.|`|oFUqegjfaa	Its kind of slutty.  Why would you have sex with someone you're not even attracted to?|`|oChms6KJaa	If your okay with it.|`|AA10267825	Nope as long as ur both safe about it. No need to spread disease or anything. Enjoy yourself!|`|JUEkTETAaa	only if you want to put yourself in that predicament....that will be up to you|`|hmLo323Uaa	It is your body, do with it what you wish, but keep a few things in mind.  Men can separate feelings and sex, most women can not.  Chances are you will start to grow attached to this guy, and will be devastated when he dumps you.  You also seem young and by asking this question in the first place, susceptible to suggestion. Saying this, I doubt you will use protection from the beginning of the act until the end ( you can also get certain STDs through just oral sex as well), so I suggest reading up on teen pregnancy and the affects of STDs when you do get something (Google up some pictures).<br>  <br>  If you don’t respect your self and your own body now, don’t complain if he does not respect you later. Have fun!<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  BP|`|NpzNHmCGaa	If you kind of like him, as in kind of have feelings for him, if I was you I wouldn't go there. The reason im saying this is if you sleep with him the chances are your liking of him will get more and you may end up wanting a relationship and if he doesn't you could end up hurt. A word of warning I think guys find it far easier to emotionally detatch in that type of arrangement. To say to you out right he would do you in a heart beat suggests to me he is just after sex. Its up to you what you do at the end of the day what im saying is be cautious and think about what you really feel for this guy, before sleeping with him.|`|oQwnbblyaa	if you are having sex, it could be unsafe to be friends with benefits. but if you are just hooking up and maybe messing around a little, it's fine. i've had friends with benefits. just be careful about your rep because one public mistake and boom your a ****.! so just be careful. try to do things not in the public. :) good luck! be safe!|`|x9TgRvkbaa	That depends on if you have a man and he has a woman, casual sex is honestly not for me, but to each is own. I would defiantly be careful.|`|bgA0bP2Vaa	me and my ex best girlfriend had our friendship completely ruined by this. i got jealous as hell when she ended up getting a bf a few months later and i stopped talking to her.|`|MwAjGWSgaa	nothing wrong with that as long as you're being smart/ safe... oh yeah and try not to get your feelings involved because that will really mess things up.|`|24r0kVmyaa	it never works. ever.|`|0a6cbab3e9df10aad3a3ec370744a574aa	if you don't think it'l jeapordise your friendship, go 4 it|`|cMpV5aRsaa	GO FOR IT. what are you waiting for. let him *** inside you too. it feels great.|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	the whole friends with benefits thing just sounds skanky to me.|`|qjy5OirNaa	No, not at all, go ahead, i have a few|`|e1Z4N0qIaa	the only problem with that is you never know if he's committed. dont have sex, its a bad idea.|`|dWwrZs6Aaa	i would tap that
5I01tsgYaa	Your father was abused.  It doesn't matter if it was a family secret or not.  He and all of his siblings were abused.  Probably because of this, your dad never really figured out how to deal with his anger.  His breaking down doors for the sole purpose of being able to spank you with a belt is not acceptable.  His throwing you across a room is definitely not acceptable.  Your dad needs help.<br>  It's good that you don't feel that you were abused even though you were.  It means that a chance for a normal relationship with your father is still possible.  But he needs to understand that what he is doing IS abuse and is wrong.  He is already ashamed of how he behaves, as evidenced by his telling you not to tell anybody what happens.  He will never be able to deal with his anger if not.<br>  It took my moving out for my father to figure out how close he was to completely losing his daughter.  He's been in therapy for a few years now, and we have a great relationship.|`|4hr9JGAdaa	Yes, that is abuse, and if he is still doing that, you need to tell somebody. Good luck.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	You were disciplined, not abused.  As you said, you did something to anger him and cause the punishment.  If he did that to you for no reason, then yes it'd be abuse.  Plus, it was spankings with a belt which is common, it's not like he punched you in the face.  Also, the thing about breaking down doorknobs, I don't see anything wrong with it.  When I was punished and spanked when I was a kid, a locked door and me being in my room isn't an excuse to get out of the discipline of spankings.|`|gP7XSy9paa	yes that is because its alright if a mum or dad just gives a little smack on the bum but that what u just said goes a bit too far|`|TEPHIk8Oaa	I've experienced something like that too.<br>  And that is abuse.|`|hzAidxdkaa	sounds like abuse to me... anger issues he should have checked|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Any physical contact by a parent such as slapping, shaking, etc is considered corporal punishment by the government, so yes according to the state its abuse! So your experience is Definitely abuse!|`|siz5uRL3aa	Um I think u were i think he has some child hood issues and he's taking it out on u.. umm the whole "pain goes away eventually" he could be talkiing about his pain... idk just a  thought..|`|lsFveRfFaa	yes you were abused|`|uCmFLmSkaa	nope that's legal|`|9HM4Cs2laa	yes|`|fZYBvy2daa	the most blunt way i can put it.. is yes.<br>  <br>  thats my opinion anyway|`|3o2KVvMyaa	It seems to me, he took it too far. And I believe in spanking a misbehavedd child, but that seems extream.<br>  <br>  Move out as soon as you turn 18 or try and go away to college.

AA10197672	You feel very insecure! You should've gone and seen how she was treating you, it migh tnot be what you think it is. She might be very proud to go tthere with you and introduce you to them. You wont know unless you try. And yes, telling her to cut her relationships with guys is not right. Unless she si doing something to make you believe she is cheating on you with them or she is too friendly with them, then yes! And you should never let her to go out with the guys alone. Go with her always.....|`|syMxQEF3aa	No, you are not wrong. If you don't want her going out to meet and hang with a bunch of guys then you have every right to tell her that. She would do that same if the situation was reversed and you were hanging out with a bunch of women!|`|dbQHlp85aa	Well, you should have faith in your wife and in your marriage that she will not cheat on you.. <br>  <br>  However, she should have enough respect for you to tell her friends that her husband is not comfortable with them calling all of the time. Her place is at home with her family but at the same time, you can't threaten her with leaving because she has friends. <br>  <br>  While the man is the head of the house, that doesn't give him the right to control his wife. <br>  <br>  Maybe, if she wants to hang out with her guy friends, maybe they should come over to the house while you're there.. or maybe you can go with her when she wants to go out. <br>  <br>  But issues like these are called parasites and all parasites should be removed from the relationship because they will just suck the life right out of the marriage.|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, do you want to get into the pants of the women friends that you have?<br>  But, if she is out at the bars and clubs with these guys without you, you do have a right to get pissed off.<br>  If she doesn't feel her commitment to you requires her to show you the respect a wife shows a husband, then you need to take some action on it.<br>  It's one thing to have male friends, I don't have a problem with that.<br>  But it is entirely another for her to frequently just run out on the town with them and party.<br>  That is disrespectful to you.|`|gr6e1WZEaa	People will be where their heart is.

However, if she is inviting you to go along, I don't think you should leave her. You will feel more comfortable if you go. I can respect you asking her not to go alone with them, but if she asks you to go with her, you should. It's wrong to expect it.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Do you really think if she was doing anything wrong, she'd keep inviting you to go along or want you there ?? I'm sure they're just buddies that she's having fun with and she's hurt that you don't want to go.  Why don't you try going and having fun with your wife and doing something she wants to do and trusting her??|`|MqCuDV4Naa	U r right they do want to get in her pants. If she can't do with out the attention of other guys, then maybe she is not the girl for you.<br>  <br>  Personally I have no idea why people, not just women, who are addicted to attention from the opposite sex, get married. It almost never lasts.|`|jLKcuMNraa	dont be so controlling. if i was given that ultimatum i would leave without you telling me. ask if you can hang out with them and if she says no then you have something to worry about.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I think your wrong and your should definitely meet things guys. You should go play pool with them. <br>  If your uncomfortable with these guys then make sure your wife doesn't see them unless your with her..|`|PQwRl27Jaa	well if she care n love u she will stop keeping so much guy friends<br>  i once date a girl who had alot a male friends n when i find out she at one time date them so i left her.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	you're insecure.

X9W689ZGaa	A lot of girls enjoy anal sex, and especially the pleasure they give to their boyfriends through it. Enjoy the moment!
FXCoGD44aa	This is a common desire of a lot of soon-to-be newly weds. There are still a number of people, as you can see from some of your answers, that find this rude. In old-age, yes it was very rude to make such a request. But this is the 21st century and most people getting married already have most of what they need. I promise, people will understand.<br>  <br>  1. Tell your immediate family and close friends right away [[aka: the people who are not going to get offended by "I only want $$"]] and tell them that if anyone asks about what to get you, what you want. A tactful and non-rude way to have them put it is, "They are saving for ___"<br>  <br>  2. Don't register. On the wedding invitation, guests are going to be looking for where the couple is registered for a gift idea. When they don't see them, most people just automatically assume cash.<br>  <br>  3. [[This goes with #2]]. Indicate on the invitation for your guests to call your mom to RSVP. Likely when they call, they will ask what to get you and she can pass on the word that you are saving for ___.<br>  <br>  WHAT NOT TO DO:<br>  *** Don't assume that everyone is going to give you a gift or money. They are not obligated.<br>  *** Don't ever EVER ask for cash from anyone or print that anywhere on the invitation.<br>  <br>  However, you're bound to get a few tangible gifts. Be sure to act just as gracious and thankful as anything and send a polite thank you card right away.|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	Its not rude I think its a great idea for couples that have everything. My parents went to a wedding 20yrs ago and they asked for money instead of a gift to buy a dining room set and then invited ppl to their place for a cocktail party later on to show the guests what their money had gone too.|`|nqINitkmaa	This is a big NO NO. You should never expect gifts from your guests. Their presence is enough. You can't pick and choose the gift that guests may or may not give you. They will give you a gift or cash whatever they feel is appropriate. Most of the time people bring cash, or checks to the reception, but if they bring a gift be thankful for their thoughtful gesture.|`|ScHW4842aa	I would put a small note on the invitation <br>  <br>  : Cash presents only, please.|`|o1yy6KABaa	No its not rude, its very common nowadays to request no gifts as such. You could have a wishing well where the guests place a card with money or gift cards in it, and on the invitation or with it you can write up a little funky poem saying why you dont need pots,pans,or towels etc and would rather have the money for....whatever your goal is (maybe you are renovating a house or saving a deposit for a house) <br>  you could maybe try googling wishing well poems to get an idea. Or you could have a money tree where people put the envelopes on for you.|`|07f8af82c44cad0ad314af70c5b88735aa	I don't think it's rude.  Should mention it in the invitations that you will not be having a shower, etc etc that IF they CHOOSE to want to give you a gift you would APPRECIATE a monetary gift.  But definitely BEFORE the wedding day, as they may not carry wads of cash on that day.  Hardly anybody carries checks these days either.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	Yes, it's rude.  Don't ask or hint about gifts.  <br>  <br>  Your non-rude option is to not register for anything.  When guests ask your mom what to get you (and ONLY when they ask) she can tell them that you would prefer money.<br>  <br>  If you get stuff that you don't want, you write a gracious thank you note and thank your lucky stars you have friends and family who are generous and care about you.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	WOW, how lucky are you, all new stuff. Unbelievable!! We are raiding the attics, storage buildings of 3 sets of grandparents and free on craigslist for our basic needs.We are really hoping for the toasters etc. and hopefully having stuff to put in them to start out with. lol But.... I still don't think I would ask for money, but hope we get some, I truly do!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Don't register anywhere.  Most people will get the hint.  For others, just spread it by word of mouth.  You will still get gifts, but not as many.|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	Money – to ask or not to ask, that is the question.  And the answer is definitely not to ask…but that doesn't mean  someone can't get the word out for you.<br>  <br>  So…what's the real story about money as a wedding gift?  The first part of the story is that it is never appropriate for the bride or groom to ask for money or to include a request for money in their wedding invitation.  If it is what they want or need the most, they should get the word out through family members, and it absolutely should never come from them, even if they are asked point-blank.  Should that happen, the response might be that any gift is more than welcome, although money is high on their wish list because… (fill in the blank).   Guests will appreciate, and are more likely to feel comfortable, giving cash if they know how their gift may be used.  For example, if the bride and groom are saving for a down payment on a home or for household furnishings, honeymoon, etc.  (It is a good idea to include its use in your thank you note, as well.)<br>  <br>  The rest of the story is that money seems to be not only a much-needed commodity by most young couples starting out, but also a gift that most people are willing to give.  According to Peggy Post, famous etiquette author Emily Post's great-granddaughter-in-law and current spokesperson for the Emily Post Institute, "for many couples, money makes an ideal gift.  And there are terrific options in monetary gifting today; guests should consider alternatives to cash and personal checks such as universal gift certificates..."<br>  <br>  American Express also offers a Gift certificate that comes attractively packaged in a gold envelope, looking very "wedding giftish."  According to American Express Vice President Kristine Olson, the elegant presentation of Gift certificate has a definite impact on the gift recipient.   "What we find with Gift certificate is that there's a special, keepsake value unlike cash or personal checks. Couples actually hold onto Gift certificate they receive until they find the exact, perfect thing they want to buy with them, whether they want to put it toward furnishing their house or even to help pay for their wedding," says Olson.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that requests for money continue to be a somewhat delicate subject, but it is acceptable and must just be handled with sensitivity and diplomacy.   You can do that.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Yes, it would be rude to ask for just money. Even if you are registered, 75% of the gifts you receive will be envelopes filled with cash anyway.  But if someone bought you a gift and brought it to the reception and they saw a cash box, they aren't going to go back to Macy's return the gift and fill an envelope with cash. They'll leave on the table the gift they bought.<br>  <br>  A lot of the gifts we received at the wedding were not ones that we registered for.  I'm half Irish, so we received several Beleek and Waterford gifts. They are gorgeous and are proudly displayed in our home.  I like them because when I see them, I think of the people that gave them to us.<br>  <br>  Surely there must be a few things that you want/need.  Go register at somewhere like Bergners, Macys, or Target and just walk through the aisle and pick things that you want/need or just need to replace because yours has seen better days.  Your "I like to bring a gift" people will appreciate it, and its money for items you would have bought anyway.<br>  <br>  BTW, I would register for some thing...anything that you need.  I have one friend who did not register at all.  In her ethnic culture, crystal is a common wedding gift.  Without giving any direction about what she wanted, she wound up with a lot of mismatched crystal.  She would have been better off picking a pattern that she liked so that she would have a complete set. LOL.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Sorry: it is rude.  It's actually really rude.  I know lots of people are doing it, but they have no class.<br>  <br>  A gift is optional: competely non-obligatory.  No-one has to bring one for your wedding, you invited them for the pleasure of their company.  As such, you cannot even realise that they are going to bring you anything, and must be surprised and thrilled if they choose to do so - such a shock, whoat a lovely thing to do - you know the drill.<br>  <br>  However, there will be people who do not know what to get you but who would love to get you something.  Those people might be told, probably by mother of bride who sends out the wedding invitations, in a separate card, what MOTHER thinks might be an idea. YOU don't even know she's sending it, okay? it had nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  But in the end, I NEVER give cash, on principle, I find it disgusting.  I buy silver or crystal bowls etc. Iconic stuff. Heirloom stuff. Don't ask for cash:  you have no idea what you're doing to yourself.  <br>  <br>  Oh: as to lists, you could list ideas such as 'crystal bowls, old silver sugar spoons' - that sort of stuff. It doesn't have to be grotty appliances.  It doesn't have to 'set you up'.  It can be something sweet, or pretty, that you'd never get for yourself.  I NEVER look at wedding lists, either.  Yuck.  And as to knowing the dollar value of the gift you receive, I absolutely point blank balk at that, too.  You will never know what the gift I bought cost you.  It's tacky and embarrassing.  It's part of why I never give to a list or give cash.  utter yuck.<br>  <br>  Editing again... you don't sound like a snob: what you run the risk of looking like, is trailer park trash.  It's so trash, it really, really is.  Ghastly.<br>  <br>  Hope I'm not being too ruthless, but there you go. Always best to say what you mean I guess.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	Honey why in the time of this economic crisis are you trying to get ure mom to pay for everything?Furniture + appliances! WOW! thats a lot of stuff.Dont get me wrong here,its no doubt sweet of her:) but dont you want to have the fun of picking and choosing stuff for ure new life and getting registered at all those different stores?asking ure fiance what he thinks of each of the things thats the fun of it,(and ure friends have to pay for it,you dont:P and you appreciate each thing cuz friend "x" bought the toaster and friend "y" bought the blender...that sort of thing you know?<br>  I dont know,but it sounds rude to ask 4 money...i mean how much isevery1 supposed to pay??what if in this time of crisis ppl cant give the  set amount of cash that you want each guest to pay?It reminds me of the charity/church collection boxes that ppl drop dimes into....plz dont do that it sounds like ure asking for charity with the collection box thing.....|`|nBjQQ3yraa	Yes it is rude!  I do understand where you are coming from, but it is a gift and therefore should be up to the giver.  If you get things you don't want take them back to the store for store credit or a refund.  There again you might want to be careful about that too depending on whether the gift giver intends to visit your home.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Trust me.  A true snob would never ask this question because they don't need to.<br>  <br>  YOU NEVER EVER ASK FOR MONEY AT A WEDDING!<br>  <br>  YES IT IS TACKY.<br>  <br>  Yes,  I was shouting.  You would not sound snobish you would sound pathetic in this attempt.<br>  <br>  If you have everything you need you simply do NOT register or have any money grubbing attempts at your wedding.<br>  <br>  A wedding is not about making money...it is about those you truly care about sharing in your special day.|`|4066RDqKaa	you don't sound like a snob, but i just wouldn't register anywhere.|`|e489ymwhaa	no it wouldnt be rude|`|4POGapREaa	It's not snobby, it's just blatantly tacky & asking for money.  You should never request anything from your guests to attend your wedding so to have a money box set up at the reception is pretty much begging for dollars & making people uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  If your guests choose to give you something, they will contact the person you appointed to deal with that on your RSVP's and ask what you would prefer or whether or not you have a registry they can buy from.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	You let everyone know you'd prefer cash by telling your bridesmaids, groomsmen, and family members.  Then if anyone asks one of them what you two need or asks you directly, you let them know that monetary gifts are preferred because your mother will be providing furniture and appliances.  Any other method is rude, even if you do it as politely as possible.  Don't have a cash box; that's rude too.  If all someone can afford is a blender, be thankful that they gave you anything at all.  Also, if you really don't want the gifts you receive, there's always the option of returning it.  My husband and I received duplicates of some items so we returned them for store credit.  Just please don't ask people for cash.
wwBZh6lbaa	If you told her, it would really complicate things.  It would probably also change things between you.  She might not trust you around him anymore and then it would cause a problem with your friendship.  It's up to you if you think the friendship is worth risking.|`|ngLwXT23aa	i dont think that i would tell her if i were you. talk about akward|`|JUEkTETAaa	try looking at him as a brother|`|8FbOtXAXaa	This is your best friend that we are talking about here right? If you like him or are attracted to him you need to keep that info to yourself unless you want to risk losing your best friend.|`|pmUiunTlaa	its better to be honest with her about it than hide it from her! bc if she finds out from someone else things could get sticky!! so just tell her!|`|eEDF5KLXaa	if you are a true friend you will not have that **** in your head leave your friend man you are not to be trust with people man get your own man
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	1.Maxim is full of articles.  The magazine has like 100 pages, and no more then 20 have hot girls on them.  The rest of the magazine is full of guy articles 'how to win a bar fight' and 'dirty jokes' and 'tech gizmos'.(Our office has the 'Maxim Escape Plan' for how to live when a co-worker goes crazy and starts shooting people, hanging on the bulletin board.)<br>  <br>  2.The girls in Maxim are perfect, on purpose.  It's part of how they sell their magazine.  People want to see perfect photos, not normal photos.  This is true of all things, such as movies too.  Keep in mind that only like 1% of girls in the whole world are perfect, with just natural beauty, enough to make it in the magazine...and they are still made-up, set up, and photoshoped on top of that. (That babe on the car photo takes like seven hours to shoot...one picture).<br>  <br>  3.Just because people look at perfect people, does not mean they want that in real life.  Deep down, all guys know the girls in Maxium are fake(as girls know all those guys in the girl magazines are fake).  In real life, a guy wants more then just a pretty face.  Sure, looks are high on most guys lists, but few guys have it as the only thing on the list.  Your guy likes you, for more then just your looks.
kYtZqeIaaa	Firstly, make sure that you want to be liking this girl. If she is going around flirting with other guys, then she may not be the girl she seems. She may seem confident, but she might really be insecure and confused, and you'll have to pick up the pieces of her breakdowns and other issues, and you might get pulled into the drama. <br>  <br>  But it might be all worthwhile too. <br>  <br>  If that is the case, then you need to be yourself, most importantly. If you want to get her attention, hang around with her as much as you can. Invite her places, don't be shy, but don't ask her on a date yet. <br>  If you can't think of things to say, then think of things to say beforehand. Take a couple of good topics that you can carry a conversation with and write them on a list. When with her,  just rememeber things on the list and you will be okay when it comes to the conversation. If she still doesn't answer well, then  try to get the information out of her. Say things like "hey, i know you can say more than that" in a joking matter. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything|`|z2IUgVOXaa	Ok this is coming from a girl:don't ask blunt questions or you will get blunt answers. you should ask her to get a drink or something but say AS FRIENDS. if she says no SO WHAT! it doesn't matter! lots of other girls in thew world! Life is too shprt to waste it on things like this. Find real love and life will lat eternally|`|FiyJCT15aa	sometimes staying as friends is better u wudnt wanna ruin a gud friendship but take chances if u feel its right|`|Eh2lPi3iaa	All I can say is spend alot of time around her, girls like that in guys and flirt right back! Girls like it alot, and make sure you are yourself and don't pretend to be anyone else other than you.
bgd2Utboaa	lol good question:D|`|AA10154901	it's a saying, it's not necessarily true. brunettes can have fun, redheads, whatever.|`|Qs1oyuJpaa	whats with people all gaining up on fat people|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Those ones whore themselves out.|`|a1Fz1Zb2aa	hmmm... i thiink its just a sayin, nott  truee a dnt think tho... heehee|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	people are people.  Brunettes are known are good girl, girlfriend type...blondes party girls, but they suck in bed.   Fat girls...couldn't tell ya, most guys forget us =/
ubbKS6BBaa	Both are pretty but I think the one on the left has potential to look better? She needs to grow out some more eye brow and lay off so much eye liner. The other girl I think is prettier right now because she looks natural.<br>  She could probably use a little make up to enhance her features. <br>  <br>  That's what I think.<br>  <br>  Both pretty but certain things could make them prettier.|`|zx5zzf53aa	the one on the right because her hair is cuter and she isn't wearing so much eyeliner.|`|d1a57165e69fb7e3ade74a8659b315cdaa	I am the prettiest one of all!|`|qy07K2k5aa	In my honest opinion, both are equal, really.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	2nd, cuz the 1st one looks like Satan.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	That's a tough question.  The girl on the left is totally hot and I would like to get "with her", but the girl on the left is a bit prettier and nicer looking and I would like to develop a relationship with her, get to know her better.|`|BdALIympaa	if i had to choose..<br>  <br>  <br>  i'd say the chick on the right.<br>  but,|`|AA11599430	neither one in my opinion|`|pZevjTXGaa	the first one
5ajPMlrqaa	Why do you feel like you need to turn to a group of strangers for your moral compass? Is it ok to flirt with your neighbor? Well, what does our opinion on that really count for? We could say yes or no, but will it really influence your choice to flirt or not to flirt? At the end of each day, it is your life, and you must bear the reward or the consequence of it.<br>  <br>  You say your husband is drifting apart and you wonder if he's cheating - I imagine that must be a very lonely feeling. Have you asked your husband if everything is ok, and have you told him that he seems far away, as if something is on his mind? I would suggest you try that, if you haven't already. Speak softly, in a quiet room, maybe massage his shoulders, and try to have a heart-to-heart with him. Maybe things are rough at work and he is afraid to tell you because he wants you to see him as a strong man.<br>  <br>  You say your husband doesn't flirt anymore, and that must make you feel neglected as well... why don't you suggest that you and your husband go on a date like you used to? Perhaps your husband has gotten so comfortable with you that he has forgotten how to flirt with you and seduce you, like he did in your earlier stages of the relationship?<br>  <br>  Try to re-open the lines of communication with your husband, and I think you'll find that your neighbor won't be as interesting. Good luck, my friend.|`|31d0a24439ecffe20e04cb85a1238aecaa	you are headed for dangerous waters.  If you love your husband - talk to him about how you feel.  You can easily check if he is having an affair - and - you are headed for one.  If you value your relationship STOP now and talk - to him - to a minister - to a councilor or someone who can help.  Spend your time making it work instead of starting over.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	This is not ok. You are craving the attention your husband used to give you and this neighbor is doing the job now. You have to WORK at remembering the things you love about your husband and DO things to reinforce that love, which include NOT flirting with your neighbor.<br>  <br>  You are playing with fire and you will regret this if you continue. Good luck.|`|BNrlqFOhaa	First of all stop paying any attention to your neighbor. If you cant work things out with your husband then i think  you should get a divorce before you do anything with anyone else. Why don't you try having a date night with your husband when he comes back from his trips. Make him feel special too, maybe that feeling has gone away because you used to do certain things to him in the begining.|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	You say your not a home wrecker yet one of your previous questions states about an affair your having with a married man. Your boyfriend was in prison but your married, Me thinks your a troll.|`|hDhHSe31aa	I think you should see a marriage counciler. It is ok to be friendly to your neighbor, but not to the point that it makes it seem like you two are flirting.|`|AA12185240	No ti's not all right to flirt with you neighbor he may get the wrong idea try flirting with your husband it works|`|AA10410277	nope it's not okay because it feels like you might brake them apart that's not good at all!|`|L9QckBC4aa	First off, you have said that you trust your husband, but even having a little bit of doubt in his loyalty...means that somewhere inside you have a certain insecurity.<br>  As for regaining that spark, focus less on the neighbor and a little more on the time you do have with your husband. Make each moment count, compliment him, flirt with him, kiss him...do things that will make him fall again for you.<br>  But then again, he also needs to work at it. You should discuss how you're feeling about the state your marriage is in and both of you should begin to work at it.<br>  <br>  As for the question "is it ok to flirt with my married neighbor"....the answer is no.|`|LvTIVjySaa	Never.  One thing to be friendly and warm with people, but entirely out of bounds for you to be thinking of them in questionable ways.  Sounds like you are projecting your guilt on your hubby and looking for a reason to do the dirty on him and that's no fair.  Cheating, especially with children involved is a nasty, ugly, horrible thing to do.  You come into marriage with honesty, and you should leave marriage the same way, without involving innocent parties.  Fine, you have feelings for him.  Is it enough to harm his family and yours?  If these feelings are that strong, you both need to come clean with your spouses, get out, and explore your relationship only when you are both divorced.  There's a reason cheating is an ugly word.  Don't cheapen yourself by giving into instant gratification.  If your marriage is not working out, his isn't either, don't build a new relationship on a foundation of lies and sneaking around.  Good luck.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Make your mind up.  You asked two questions, to flirt or how to bring that spark back to your relationship? I think you should take your mind off that married man.  Talk to your husband about how you feel.  Read books together on the subject.  Help to make him notice you.  Make sure you are looking your best when he gets home and show him a lot of attention.  It will be hard for him not to notice.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Lol that is logic bull crap..... "im not going to cheat with him" word to the wise......what a women logically says and what she does are completely different......you would totally cheat on him if the emotions were their.Why don't you inform your husband of the problem god damit we are so tired from work we can't go into mind reading mod......enough of you testing are strength......just tell us.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	NO, it's not okay and from what you say about your relationship with your own husband, you WILL wind up cheating on your spouses.<br>  <br>  Spend that flirting on your husband. Make believe he's a stranger that you're trying to seduce. <br>  <br>  Hey, you did it once to get him, you can't stop after the "I Do's."|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No its not ok.<br>  <br>  You are disrespecting your husband and marriage by doing this.<br>  <br>  Work on your marriage instead of flirting with another man that's what you should do.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Is it ok to flirt? Well would you think it was ok to flirt, if it were your husband and some hot 20 year old with a rock solid body? <br>  <br>  the reason you are not feeling like your husband is into you, is because you have been to focused on your neighbor.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	Nope- not okay to flirt.  If you don't want to fall off of a cliff- then you stay far away from the edge.  <br>  <br>  Start flirting with your hubby and romancing him.  Love's a choice!|`|13hFRGN9aa	if you love your husband then you wouldn't be flirting with other men. and yes you are a home wrecker because then you wouldn't even be thinking that way.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	It's kind of disrespectful, not to mention it might lead to something else.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Eventually you will end up having an affair. Why don't you try rekindling the relationship with your husband? It is a marriage a partnership. It takes two to make it work. Invest time and energy into flirting with your husband. Would you mind if the neighbor wife was flirting with your husband in the same manner? If the answer is no you would not mind (honestly) then continue on. However, eventually you will take this to a place you do not wish to go. Common sense. You are already feeling neglected emotionally per your statement.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	I am confused. You were having sex with a 19 year old and then having an affair with a married man and then pregnant with your ex's baby yet now your acting innocent like you wouldn't do such a thing and that your not a homewrecker, like somehow this is all new to you and exciting...your a friggin slut...you flirt and sneak around, no wonder your husband doesn't want your nasty a$$! Unbelivable!|`|fQYU96euaa	No dont flirt with your neighbor...thats not cool and disrespectful to his family.<br>  If you truly trusted you husband then you wouldnt have those thoughts that he "might be cheating" so you might want to start with telling your husband how you feel about the lack of affection and time you spend with each other.|`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	No! It is not ok. Yes! You will wind up having an affair. Don't do it. Show him this question & tell him you wrote it. Get you & your husband to a therapist as soon as you can. You really need it badly.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Close your eyes and imagine how you'd feel and react if your neighbor's wife flirted with your husband and your husband told you how good it makes him feel.|`|R1h0bHeMaa	No, its not okay.|`|7qr2GprBaa	How on earth to you expect to "bring the spark back" to you relationship with your HUSBAND by flirting with another man???<br>  <br>  You are just asking for trouble, sister. If you really want your relationship back with your husband, then talk to him about how you are feeling. If he won't talk to you, then make an appointment with a marriage counselor. You are headed down a path that I was down about 2 years ago. Long story short: our lives got busy, we drifted apart, both communicated less and less. He ended up having an affair, I found out. He wanted a divorce, I said not unless we try counseling first. <br>  <br>  Well, the counseling worked and we are still together. However at NO time did I think I could make my relationship better by flirting with someone else. If nothing else, imagine how you would feel if your neighbor's wife started flirting with your husband because he wasn't paying enough attention to her. Try to remember that you are not messing with one or two lives, but four, and potentially more.|`|H6ErlcL1aa	There's no law against it, but you're on shaky ground morally. I think if you were flirting with your neighbour and your husband walked up, you would stop immediately. It's not cool to show any kind of sexual intent to someone who isn't your husband, whether or not you follow through. <br>  <br>  The way to bring the spark back to your relationship is to focus your attention on your husband, and stop feeling all giddy and 'adored' when your married neighbour looks at you -- he doesn't literally adore you, he doesn't know what it's like to live with you, and he's doing it for his own ego as well. Imagine you were to have a relationship with him, and wonder if he'd still be doing it five years down the line once it wasn't fun anymore. Your future is with your husband.

Just because you say very much doesn't mean he doesn't feel the same way about you. If it really bothers you say something to him about it or stop saying very much because oddly enough when my wife quit calling me a certain nickname it bothered me and it was just because she didn't think I liked it but it was one of those things that I enjoyed to hear.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	he loves you but he's not going to marry you, die for you, or anything that intense. <br>  <br>  don't ask him for so much, its pressure for him and disappointment for you. is it worth it if you both get pissed in the end?|`|4k7AHnvAaa	Ask him, it's the only way you'll get an answer. People here can only give you opinions, the only response you'll be satisfied with is one from him.<br>  <br>  Also being honest about your feelings is key to having a strong relationship.|`|8p31dENPaa	Stop being a girl and over analyzing it.

One would then not have any contact with him for 7 days . Be strong and stick to your guns .<br>  <br>    Within a couple of days you will start receiving flowers , which is always helpful to give to a friend or family member if they feel down . Chocolates and candy will be in abundance aswell . If you keep on ignoring him his feelings will grow even stronger , he will tell you anything that you ask he will obey . This is always convenient when jobs need to be done for yourself a friend or family , example fixing a fence or painting the outside of a house .<br>  <br>     Tell this chap that he needs to prove himself more than the tasks you have already set him , so look forward to shopping trips for new clothes with your friends . Also eating in the most expensive restaurants you can find to dine in , obviously paid for by your boyfriend in his mission of proving his love to you .<br>  <br>    There will come a time when this chap will be exhausted from your constant demands in proving his love for you most probably a lot poorer too , he will then tell you he loves you and will finish with the words ..".Very Much ". This will be proceeded by how much he has missed you that the relationship is special that he realises he took you for granted and it will never happen again . Finally he will end with the words " please carry on being my girlfriend ".<br>  <br>     This is when you tell him that you have thought long and hard about his proposition but decided to end the relationship with him and to concentrate on going your separate ways .<br>    Hope this has been of some use , kindest regards , cheerio .<br>  <br>     PS: haha that was only a joke , maybe you are into too much self analysis regarding your boyfriend , just go with the flow . Give Holly B the 10 points .|`|RfxyVIh4aa	I would and am thinking:  You are probably very young.<br>  <br>  Actions speak louder than words.  If he treats you in a loving way, I wouldn't recommend getting silly over something like the phrase "very much."

Generally men wants to have more sex rather ladies doesn't. If she like foreplay you should do that.<br>  <br>  More ever if it is a question on health aspect. I am not sure that weather its safe to have daily sex. <br>  <br>  Rather I learnt it thru some book that if you want to be healthy and wealthy and you have big goals to achieve then you should do sex once in a life and if you Does not get satisfied go for second sex but it should not cross three sex in total life.<br>  <br>  Don't get afraid. Its mentally make or break you. So think positively and you will enjoy THE LIFE not sex only.<br>  <br>  All the best and God Bless.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Absolutely normal.

84f5a6dec142acc78ac9e610aafcbd12aa	Wow, woman I am going through the same thing. I will say this in my ordeal I was the more laid back one when he ignited a conversation with me and pursued me. Then I started to see him from an emotional stand point by then I also noticed he was those laid back kind of  lovers. I mean we all are at one point but it dosen't help the person who is on a full throttle. So when we are the ones giving more into it, we start to feel doubt and inadequacy because we as people sometimes like to feel nurtured and appreciated. Only time will tell. If you love him or like him enough to hope to one day love him then... wait. The thing's that are hardest to love are usually the best thing's to love. It's the process that makes it all worthwhile. I am still going through it. I'll tell you what happens with me if you stay tune, by that time your own answers may come through lifes revelations.

If they say something mean to you, just reply with, Whatever. there is a that 70's show episode where hype teaches jackie to be cool, aloof, zen. IT WORKS. watch the show and follow it. email me for more questions.|`|nLDzpHxUaa	Keep your true friends and forget the old ones. Screw them!<br>  and yes, i know its harder said then done. But you really have to 4get it. and ignore it. because in middle school there will always be drama. and you will always run into it. but try making new friends. dont worry about the little "cliques" .be yourself and true friends will come to you!|`|TaR6eXpcaa	dont think and analyze to much, just interact, talk , and be there ,whatever will be will be, but dont over think, just be more social and less emotional.

IE1TrA4Qaa	tell him that he is quiet and that's okay because you are too! Then just talk to him about school and get to know him|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	awww, maybe he's just offended that you said that about him.<br>  if he does like you, he was probably just embarrassed.<br>  so what i would do is even though i'm incredibly shy also.. i would walk up to him and say hi.<br>  or at least im him.|`|CVPDStTCaa	OK first things fist go and talk to him or IM him or e-mail him saying the only reason you said he was quite was because you have newer talked to him or heard him talk. AND, you sit in the front of the class so you don't know when hes talking to his friends in class. He shouldn't be offended because you said hes quite he doesn't even know you that well.|`|qp9RfkARaa	first of all how did he get your email address?? <br>  And he is most likely not going to just go up to you and talk to you if he is pissed of with you, you have to go talk to him and ask why he is mad with you. good luck!|`|O9aaX9Vraa	Yea I agree with what the first guy said. Everyone is different so even if it doesn't offend you, it could offend him. Tell him you're sorry and give him some time.|`|7RO4Pxeaaa	how can an email make him sound mad?<br>  he probably isnt mad, just confront him its obvious he likes you if he had the initiative to email you|`|rQf0XZfXaa	his name must be bignose smallpenis|`|hKDmHqAdaa	he is probably upset because he found indirectly
f7CufkSyaa	i find that cleanliness, like clearskin,  fresh breath, combed hair, is attractive. unattractive is too much makeup, goth type makeup ,black fingernails weird colored hair turn off. attractive is not too loud, unattractive is being fake or plastic. i like feminine types but tom boy is okay, as long as she isnt too masculine. physical attraction is what gets noticed but inner beauty is what makes her a keeper!!|`|p0ewbHq2aa	a girl who is kind sweet and has an amazing smile a girl who believes she is pretty not a ***** about it though and is comfortable in her own skin se is not neccasarily hot or smoking or anything just pretty:)<br>  of course hot and sexy are cool you know but i liek down to earth girlls<br>  idk but cmlumsy is a turn on lol but thats just me<br>  <br>  horny but not a slut if you get what i mean<br>  <br>  hopew that answers it:)

l7GjBVvhaa	Tell her how you all feel about this. She might not realize how bad she is acting. Sometimes people do not know until faced with the truth. If she does not change then why would you want a friend like that??<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you...
eNulfbs7aa	Block his Number...|`|llq61pN0aa	You really should have been more careful who you gave your number out to. Just tell him to get lost and get your number changed.
VSVQHKwKaa	What is wrong with having strong expectations on men in some areas, and on women in others?<br>  <br>  I highly doubt your mother-in-law is some kind of domestic slave. She sounds like a feisty, determined, self-assured little woman. <br>  <br>  So I doubt she was advocating that women should work 20 hours a day, and men should work 4. <br>  <br>  Rather, she is probably weighing the trouble of washing some dishes and doing some laundry (easy tasks) against lawn maintenance and roof repair and outbuilding care and anything involving heavy lifting. <br>  <br>  In other words....a delineation of duties. <br>  <br>  Is this so offensive? Is this demeaning?<br>  <br>  Or is this just common sense? <br>  <br>  I think it is.<br>  <br>  Should the duties be more or less equal? <br>  <br>  Of course. <br>  <br>  But as long as both partners have specific tasks to complete, there is no arguing over WHO does WHAT and WHEN and HOW. It's totally the provence of that individual. <br>  <br>  Simple, clean, uncomplicated and unlikely to cause strife in the marriage.<br>  <br>  Good stuff.<br>  <br>  But I think you've misrepresented your MIL's convictions. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Only if the woman lives alone...<br>  <br>  If your MIL wants to do everything for HER husband, that's her choice, but in YOUR marriage, it's up to you and your husband to determine who does what.<br>  <br>  Any man who can lay on the couch and watch his wife slave over the house without pitching in isn't a real man.  He's a sucky that has no respect for himself or his wife.|`|7royFhIgaa	Not in the least. My wife and I share the house work. We both work and live in the house.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	That's silly, outdated and old fashioned thinking.  My husband is expected to pick up after himself and pitch in when the entire family is cleaning....we sometimes divide the house up and ALL of us vaccume, mop, clean bathrooms, kitchen etc.  I do most of the tidying and laundry, but I expect all the members of the household to pick up their own STUFF.  The kids keep their rooms straight and pick up their shoes and dirty clothes off the floor etc.|`|IvMPh09baa	oh HELL NO!!!!  Your husband is a grown man, he is perfectly capable of contributing to the household duties just as you are.<br>  <br>  Tell his mother to bud out of your marriage, and her son is now living with you so she cannot just come in and make her own rules in YOUR house.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	Your mother in law has got some NERVE ..If anything she shows she is PROUD to have created such a LAZY ____- grown MAN ??!! WTF <br>  Either you hire her for a MAID ,or she can take her dirty lazy LITTLE BOY BACK HOME !!! ENOUGH Said ..................If I were you I would not break my back so much more for ETHER of these 2 LAZY ________!!!!!!!!!|`|lY2XI8kUaa	i think that both people need to help keep the house clean. regardless if one person is working and the other is not. you should tell your mother in law you both help get it dirty you both should help get it clean. and if she doesnt like the idea of her son cleaning house she can come and clean it for him|`|AA12382198	I believe if 2 people occupy a place....they both eat there.....they both sleep there.....they both mess it up.....then they're both responsible for cleaning it.<br>  <br>  If one person is unemployed the bulk of maintaining it should be on that person.....whichever sex that person is.<br>  <br>  Thankfully my husband also believes this.|`|AA10021991	if the women is home all day, and the husband is working. she should be doing the house work. i do agree if he's not working than he should help out also. when my hubby doesn't work he helps me clean around the house:)|`|RKhSRMlZaa	You mother-in-law is completely ridiculous and out of touch. <br>  <br>  It is perfectly reasonable to expect your husband to help out with the housework and even do it all if he's not working!|`|rRrxszgMaa	I actually do. I enjoyed making the house clean and presentable for my husband, even though we both worked.|`|wia9SXCPaa	NO way sister!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Tell him to get up off his lazy bottom and tell his mom to mind her own business.<br>  <br>  What does he think this is?  He needs to wake up and smell the coffee!|`|pDLZ6BGyaa	lol negative|`|DtUy1IFmaa	Your mother in law is obviously still stuck in 1955.  You need to tell her.. and your husband that things aren't the same.  He's a grown man already not a child.  He should at least be responsible for picking up some of the slack.  It's unfair to leave everything to you especially since he's not working?  Don't just throw it all at him and give him 199064854 things to do.. start off with something simple like washing dishing or doing some laundry.  Like a child.. show him little by little the things you need him to start doing.  If it doesnt work.. tell him to go marry his mom then! LOL
e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	i think the questions he would ask are <br>  why he wants to meet him?<br>  does he have to meet him?<br>  do you have any photos of him?<br>  why did he leave us?<br>  what are his new children like?<br>  can you be there too when he meets them?<br>  And i would just like to say great on you for bringing up a child on your own for 11 years, some of these away parents are a joke, they go out of a childs life and then miraculously appear when all the hard work is almost done, unbelievable, but he has a right to see his dad i suppose, and i hope your son handles the situation well, my boyfriends mum walked out on him and his dad when he was 2 years old, hes 47 now and never wants to talk about her,he never saw her and doesnt even know if she is still alive, and i know there are so many questions that must be in his head, but he hides it all, so i suppose at least your boy will not hide things like this away, but its a horrible situation for him to be in, be there for him like i know you have all these years, and good luck.<br>  YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THAT HAT, A MEDAL FOR WHAT YOUVE DONE|`|y5P4dY7aaa	If i was your son my first question would be, "Why did my dad leave us in the first place?"<br>  <br>  But why does he want to meet him now, why wasn't he in his life before so he could "meet" him?|`|pRF5LLloaa	Wrong.  It is up to you.<br>  <br>  YOU are the parent.  it is up to YOU to teach you child manners and civility, even though we live in a really nasty world.<br>  <br>  You are seriously remiss in passing this huge responsibility off to your son.  You obviously have NO idea how much that will stress him.  In his little mind, he has to make a huge adult decision: "Do I upset Dad and do what Mom says, or do I upset Mom and go see Dad?"  For HIM, it is a lose/lose situation. SOMEBODY is goping to be mad at him, no matter what he does!  DO NOT DO THIS TO YOUR CHILD!<br>  <br>  YOU need to decide if it is worth it, or not.  It sounds very much like you ex husband has his life together, and a relationship with his "real" father might do the boy good.<br>  <br>  on the other hand, you don't mention if YOU are remarried.  if you are remarried and your son has a good relationship with step-dad, then it may not be a good idea to "rock the boat" and confuse the issues.<br>  <br>  But this is NOT the child's choice -- it is YOURS. Absolutely, with no exceptions.  If YOU decide that a meeting is acceptable, then it is YOUR responsibility to TEACH you son how to act -- how to act polite, how to act kind, and how to accept the fact the he has step-brothers/sisters.<br>  <br>  DO NOT put this burden on the child.  It is YOURS, and no one else's.|`|cNEsrLUJaa	Would I want to meet strangers?<br>  <br>  He did not want to see me before why now?<br>  <br>  Why did my dad leave in the first place?<br>  <br>  dose he love his other children more than me? <br>  <br>  Was I not good enough for him, so he had to go and have more children?<br>  <br>  If I met them do I call them my brothers/sisters?|`|efzoxU0uaa	if i was him id be exited and angry at the rest of his family and planning revenge on his new wife and 3 kids and giving them evils and stuff...so he mite be really emotional
5r2Csdzwaa	You have some sexy legs. The DOLTS mind is just fogged. He's come up with some better game to throw at you soon.|`|IvMPh09baa	you sound like you are analzying what he said way way way too much.|`|VXQFT341aa	What does he mean you have potential. But yea it sounds like what he likes about you not his feelings.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	you have potential for what? i think i would be insulted by that comment.  instead of asking how he feels, ask him what you really want to know:  where is this relationship going? are we exculsuive? etc. <br>  <br>  stop being around the bush.  and if he's answer dose not coincide with your expecatition, you need to decide if you're going to wait until he feels the same about you...if he ever does.<br>  <br>  this is YOUR life and you decide how you want to live it.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Sounds like he's not that into you. Sorry.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	I know it sounds crazy, man.....|`|bszyOuIqaa	He definitely dodged the question at hand.  However, he sounds like he's still assessing the situation and mapping out how he feels about you. The fact that he said "u have potential" means he's not exactly head over heels for you right now but maybe in the future there might be sparks.|`|PEHo8g48aa	Don't look too deep! I don't know how long you two have been together, but it would seem it has been a short time. It sounds as if he's still trying to get to know you a little better before he lets you know how he feels. Right question but maybe wrong time!|`|rUufku21aa	You didn't get what you wanted to hear and you are bitching his honesty.   If he said exactly what you typed, you have potential and he is not ready to commit to you yet.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Sounds like he wants in your pants.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	next time tell him to draw you a picture.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	He's lying to you.<br>  Dump him and grab a English language tutorial.

A57LMS5Qaa	yeah. same thing happened to me. i tried to <br>  start the friendship over again, im not sure if<br>  it was the right thing to do, but its working so <br>  far. if you do decide to try and be friends again,<br>  remember it wont go back in a day, it will take <br>  effort. <33 good luck.<br>  <br>  and if your scared to go back, or you dont want to<br>  be the one to go back first, still do it. trust me. i was<br>  scared, but i went back and now our friendships<br>   almost fixed. hope i helped!|`|jK8xy3VUaa	You could still be her friend, but maybe you should tell her that you would like her support. Hope this helps you and good luck :)
5r2Csdzwaa	She wants you to take her scat! Watch out for that nasty DOLT, she wants to mess up your liver...|`|kbz5S3waaa	I'm having the same predicament right now my friend, and I know it hurts, i'm truely sorry that you're having this problem|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	sit down and talk get it all out in the open|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	Have you told her how you feel?  Quit worrying yourself and speculating, have a nice chat with her, tell her how you feel and how you miss those little things.  And then let your talk and say how she feels.  She may not even realize that you are upset.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you should live together all the time.  Prolonged absences have different effects on different people.  Being consistently gone 4 months at a time seems like it would be detrimental to even the strongest of marriages.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Perhaps it is not that she does not love you, but that she is lonely and tired of being lonely. It is called self preservation.... Ask her how she is feeling--talk to her about it.|`|77319f446fd097199247c2f8e893568aaa	plan a romantic evening (no kids)...you make all the plans, wine & dine her & share these feelings with her. How will she know how you feel if you don't tell her. You wrote very thoughtfully so I bet you speak in the same manner.<br>  Good Luck!|`|wia9SXCPaa	Talk to her.  You have nothing to loose and everything to gain.<br>  <br>  Communication is key.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|uSNn3iJDaa	You should bring these things up to your wife.  Let her know whats bothering you and then you guys figure out the root problem for the change.  Communication is key.  Good luck!|`|78J2Q1gMaa	Wow.. You are really gone alot. She's probably confused at this point because she's spending so much time alone that she probably FEELS alone.  I'm thinking (sadly) that with you gone all the time, she's re-evaluating your relationship.  When you're away, do you call her everyday? Or even send her love letters?  I don't know about your wife, but personally, just feeling like I'm a part of my significant other's life is a very big deal.  No one likes being alone all the time.  My suggestion would be to talk to her, ask her what is going on, and if things have changed so much between you.  Then ask her (if you really love her) what it is you can do to make things right again.  It may mean leaving your job and finding one that keeps you around more.|`|UAnGaeGoaa	TROLL ALERT!!! quit trolling on y!a|`|p75ZEmjXaa	I suggest you get some outside interests and pursue them while you wait.  You may be waiting for a long time.  Why, I do not know, but things go on in a woman's head that are beyond anything known to science.  There is a good chance it has nothing to do with you, but also a good chance it has something to do with you but you can't do anything about it.  She has to accept you.<br>  <br>  You don't say how long you've been married.  My wife has been like you described for years... we've been married for 12 years.  Recently there are some small signs of change, however it's just downright weird and depressing, not to mention a sexual black hole of frustration.<br>  <br>  Let me repeat, there is a good chance there is NOTHING you can do about it directly, and you should figure out how to stay happy while you wait.

r9WhvImaaa	have your own little jobs to do <br>  <br>  For instance give him the bathroom to clean once a week, do dishes etc then have ur own jobs like dusting vacuuming etc etc<br>  <br>  At least he knows then in advance what is expected of him|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Don't do anything that will directly benefit him.  I realise that sounds childish, but if he wants to behave like a spoiled child, and expects you to be his mother, treat him like a child.<br>  <br>  Do not iron his clothes, do not put his clothes away or move them for him.  Do not cook him a meal.  When he asks where "his" meal is, say "I'll make it tomorrow, I just wanna relax, stop nagging at me".<br>  Keep it up and despite the fact that his mess will drive you mad the message will sink in. <br>  <br>  When we first moved in, I washed and ironed all of my husband's badly packed clothing, he came to bed and swept it onto the floor with one hand, where it lay creased.  I told him I would never iron for him again, and I haven't - so he did his own ironing.  I noticed I seemed to be doing most of the cooking despite doing more hours, so I went into town one day on my way home and got a sandwich, then he went hungry - so he cooked meals for us equally with me.  I noticed I was doing most of the picking up and moving, so if it was his, I walled in his computer, or piled it up on his side of the bed, so he couldn't get in - he now picks up his own clothing.  <br>  <br>  You've asked nicely, nagging is a word used by men which means " I don't want to have to contribute anything to the house, I just want you to do it all, and as long as you show willing, I'll put upon you".  So, don't let him, show him what happens when you do nothing for him, and if ever he enquires about things for him tell him he is "nagging", watch him run for the hoover.  Good luck.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	dont nag, do what men do be soooo bad at it that he'll have to finish it, eg break plates when you wash them, use the wrong cleaner on the tv, eg bleach so it ruins the finish, then he'll want you to not mess with cleaning.|`|dDGKUTT1aa	have a look at  www.flylady.com ,they have a great way to get housework done effortlessly,yep he needs to get out the house and contribute financially|`|0BX8Lozkaa	LOL I had the same problem, I stopped doing them all together.

What could you possibly hope to achieve from hooking up with his brother anyway. You need to break up with your boyfriend either way, because you have no respect for him, and he deserves better.|`|edycn5ggaa	You're not supposed to flirt with him.

Stop disrespecting your boyfriend.......|`|xm0kLvnLaa	If he doesn't like you then leave him alone.|`|AA12142423	are you an idiot?|`|JZYsFg4Raa	When you find yourself liking your boyfriend's brother, the first thing you need to do is think about what it is you like about him. You may be surprised to find out that it may be the things that he has in common with his brother. This could be a sign that your relationship has become dull or lacking. You may just need to do something to spice things up and/or reopen lines of communication. Or if he is the complete opposite, then you need to consider the fact that you may just be looking for a way out of the relationship you're in. In this case, you should just break things off with your boyfriend. Whatever you do, make sure you weigh the consequences of your actions. It is not worth trying to ruin the relationship between your boyfriend and his brother. Basically, this is a no-win situation because while you may like the brother, you also stated that he does not like you in return. Even if he did, you are dating his brother! He probably will not be receptive to you if you break his brother's heart.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I believe you shouldn't do anything. If you don't like your boyfriend than dump him but don't go for his brother because REAL brothers don't let each other down that way. Trust me I should know I went through this and I ended up loosing both of them.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|lSCPvOwtaa	well...if he doesn't like you, then it's probably for a reason.<br>  <br>  flirt with him, and see what he comes back at you with.

Just let him know that you are always there, to listen, to talk, just to to be a voice on the end of the phone if he needs it.  The most important thing is that he have someone to talk to right now - let him know that person is you.  Understand that you don't have to keep talking.  Just listen to him.  It will get easier, I promise.<br>  <br>  Good luck, god bless, I will be thinking of you both xxx|`|VohbtxMDaa	Nothing you say will make it better, just try not to talk about it all the time, stay by his side, stick up for him and let him know you're there if he needs your help at any time. Every wound, however great, heals over time and some day he'll be able to smile and live productive life again.|`|w7D8P6aGaa	I am so sorry for his loss.<br>  I would leave him for a bit, let him calm down then when he's ready he'll know.

I don't buy those responses about him cheating on you.  He had a 7 yr relationship, now it is another 3 yr.  He has only 2 gals in the past 10 years.  Do the math.  Most people (including those who think you should leave him) have more than 2 different dates within 10 months.

This is a load of crap.|`|KSUksBZkaa	um red flags? how about the controling thing? it will only get worse when you get married. also, when he talked about cheating on the other girl did he ever admit that it was wrong or that he was in the wrong to do it in the first place? if not, then you may need to rethink the relationship because what do you think he is going to do when something goes wrong with you? you need to ask yourself if this guy actually has morals.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- ok, i just reread the question. he cheated with you?? well, you know what they say: what goes around comes around. if he will do it FOR you, he will do it TO you.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	unless you plan on cheating never go with the one that cheated on you with you ( you all look alike to a cheater )|`|Xv9AaAl2aa	You are kidding me right?

If your ready to move on then I would say head, but if your not and want to give him another chance or give yourself another chance then I would say heart:)-|`|mLU3DkTKaa	which got hurt worse ?? listen to that organ , it might want revenge and who are you if you deny yourself the simple pleasure of finding out for yourself which one you should listen too .|`|EIpdKw7Kaa	well, honestly you should listen to both but sometimes your heart can lead you to heartbreak so listen a little but more to your head.|`|zXpbfBcuaa	heart|`|PK5Elowdaa	While the head calculates the situation, it does not feed the heart.

yDJiiqcsaa	Yeah, wake up. He sounds like he's identified you as the gullible generic virgin of the week - soon to be next week's ex-virgin and ex-girlfriend. What do you think makes you any different from the "lots of girlfriends in the past" ?  And consider that key word - "PAST".|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	A lot of girls lose their virginity at things like that, parties where you stay the night and it isn't planned. If you know you aren't ready, don't go through with sex. Don't get drunk, that's for sure. People make bad decisions when they're drunk. Talk to him about it beforehand, how you want to wait and know that he is the right guy for you before you decide to take that big of a step. Sex is a big deal, no matter what some people say. Talk to him about your views on things before the party so he knows ahead of time. You don't want to end up regretting your first time, believe me...it hurts! :(|`|RoTLnFGZaa	yall haven't been together that long, so don't let him have it girl!<br>  you need to wait & be sure later then you can do it.safely might i add! condom, vaginal insert, birth control, plan b...everything! <br>  you don't want to do something you'll regret & i know it may seem like you just want him to be happy & yall will always be together but trust me it doesn't always work out that way.<br>  if you love him one hundred percent & you know he loves you & know that you want to and it just fear of being "bad" at it, then let it go.<br>  first of all, if he loves you it isn't going to matter all that much-seriously. and he's not expecting a hooker- you're just a virgin. i'm sure he'll be glad to teach  & help you out!<br>  it'll be fine|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	Make sure you do want to have Sex with him because if you dont dont let him pressure you into it, if he really likes you he will wait for you til ur ready. Also if you do really want to lose ur virginity with him i wouldnt suggest doing it at a party wen other people are gonna b around. This wil b somethin u rememebr for rest of your life you want it at least to b special even if your nervous. Just chat to him about the situtaion and be honest about what your feeling and what you would like/wouldnt like etc. Good luck|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	He knows you're a virgin.  What do you think he expects?  He should be honored you are considering him for your first.  If he loves you, you don't need to worry about anything.  But what's the rush?  You say you haven't been going out for very long.  If he's not willing to wait, that's a warning sign.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	If you're not ready then don't do it, cause you're going to regret it.|`|r8jHotgwaa	Well, first, you have to be sure about what you want to do. You have to be positive before you lose your virginity. If you are sure, then make sure you are protected. You don't want an unexpected pregnancy, or an STD. After the lights go down, and the imaginary music starts, just let him show you the way around the bed. After a couple of minutes, you should have a pretty good idea of what is gonna happen, anyway, good luck, but be protected!!!|`|AfodwqT1aa	i was in the same position as you... i told my boyfriend that i was a virgin and he was careful about what he done.<br>   if your boyfriend really doesn't want to hurt you then he will wait until you want...you wont disappoint him by saying no if he really loves you... <br>  wait till your ready and then tell him to be careful... i dont think men realise how much it hurts...|`|04F4149yaa	First of all, never lose your virginity or have sex at all if you are fearful of disapointment okay? You should do it when you are ready emotionally, mentally, and physically.<br>  <br>  Also, it's a party. Have fun, but not too much that you begin to feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If he expects sex and he is just a shallow S.O.B, you can do soooo much better.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lots of love and be careful :)|`|WHN5cuGZaa	he is not the one who will be disappointed.. he has had his share all ready.. you should really think it over whether he is the one you want to give it up to.. remember a girl who is a virgin is a big plus for any new boyfriends in the future.. dont give it to him just becuase you think he needs it..

I know you're a virgin but you can't really ask him to get tested if you don't. If he's been with lots of girls he could have something and not even know it, This happened to a friend of mine. Besides knowing that he is for sure disease free, this will buy you some time to decide if you're ready.<br>  <br>  Second, if your not ready don't let anyone pressure you into it. If you are ready though, then ask him to go slow and be gentle as it's your first time. <br>  <br>  By the way, if it's your party then as a good hostess you cannot be expected to disappear into a bedroom for half the night. Let him know that. After the party you can tell him that you are really exhausted from everything. Thank him for being there and let him know you'll see him tomorrow.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Your body is your own.  Don't think that you have to give him ANYTHING just because you like him.  If it makes you uncomfortable, say no.  If he still won't let you be, call the cops.  Press charges for sexual harassment.  That's what it is.  Also,  NOT accept drinks from anyone.  There is a good chance they will have date rape drugs in them.  Only get drinks yourself and don't leave them in one place and drink from them later.|`|2H0IbjRUaa	Ok well I would suggest he go get checked to see he has no STI or anything yucky in his penis so you don't catch it.<br>  Just relax and tell him to be gentle with you ;]<br>  Sex comes naturally you don't need to do much but lie on the bed. But as you become more experienced they you will be trying loads of moves.<br>  And if he loves you he wont mind how the sex was. Just that he has you ;D<br>  <br>  TOP TIP: the more relaxed you are the better sex with feel. :)<br>  have fun!xxx|`|JshtWS94aa	Please don't give it away , you can never get it back. you have something special I bet most of your friends     aren't virgins, and are sorry about it. but they won't tell you because they don't want you to be better than they are. You will be unique.|`|XqqLlBe4aa	Im in your same situation! <br>  I decided how far im willing to go with him<br>  and i don't let him go farther until im ok with it. <br>  He knows im a virgin too, and he's pretty understanding.<br>  Don't let him pressure you to do anything with him though.<br>  that was my mistake :/|`|J7k4xJtoaa	If that is what you want to do then just make sure that you are ready, and if you aren't then let him know that. If he is as good as you say he will do the right thing and either be gentel or be understanding|`|Rsr8nngWaa	If he's experienced he'll expect the absolute worst first time from a virgin girl, so really you can't disapoint, only meet or exceed expectations. Be confident and you're fine.|`|vvVrbB4Daa	if you know you could get preggo. if you r wiling to take that risk.<br>  in the future you may regret it. <br>  good luck|`|xEMjaGAaaa	yes dont go to fast but this should be the rite speed het a really painful leather whip and spank him to get him in the mood lol the enjoy the ride|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Dangerous territory.

Like don't get pressured into something you don't want to. Just tell him how you feel.  If he knows your a virgin, he probably won't worry about it. You shouldn't worry about it either. And if you love him then you love him, and if he loves you, he'll respect your decisions and your problems. So do what you feel comfortable with. Good Luck! Have Fun!|`|szLSTtuwaa	The chances are , he likes the idea of you being a virgin... Most men do. <br>  <br>  I was in the same position as you. I was myself. He didnt mind.

Unless you've been with him that long already, and you really feel comfortable.  Just keep in mind that once you have sex, it will hurt that much more when/if you break up.  Expectations will change, as well.|`|GO46i2l9aa	If he loves you then he will not pressure you.  Don't get all worked up about it and don't give him your innocence just because you think that's what you should do.  He shouldn't be expecting anything from you. When the time is right you'll know, so just be patient.|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Make sure he knows how you feel, my boyfriend know that im a virgin and he respects whatever i want to do, if he really loves you and isn't just in it for the sex then he'll respect you.|`|tr7KtZ9baa	Don't expect that he's even going to want to have sex.

You grew up and learned the reasons were hot stoves, crossing streets, whatever, all sorts of things that are obvious now that you have learned and benefited from them. <br>  There really is something to the old fashioned notion of having your parents permission.

CT3t80suaa	If you have a reputation of honesty, just keep denying whatever she says, and if possible provide evidence to do so. As you have said, she is jealous of you, try and turn the accusations around to point the finger at her. She likely won't have a response, and so that'll make her look the fool.|`|iphheJkoaa	Kick her ***.

That helps get your mind off of everything ;)|`|cSxTtqr6aa	Get her to show that TON of attitude in front of EVERYONE :) and then they will realise shes physco :)|`|V2qyE68Jaa	just ignore her rool your eyes when she does something like that and look away|`|Jii448d2aa	I would confront her in front of everyone. Only If you are comfortable with this of course. Jealously is a very ugly thing and if what you say is true about her it seems as though she may be a bit insecure with herself. Let her be. She will be her own down fall very soon. Karma is a b****!!! Regarding your other friends, if their are really your true friends they will know everything this girl is saying abut you is untrue, and eventually pity her for being so childish. Good luck and don't allow one girl to have so much control over you. Be you, people will love you for being just that!|`|tqfpfArIaa	fight back not with fist but with words (eg your so ugly u could make and onion cry) u get the pictur|`|zkcAhXf0aa	you could simply not take any notice, whenever some one says to you " oh, (ur mate) said that you did this, you slept with that, is it true you kissed that!!!", just say "whatever" if you believe her thats your problem" i know it will take a while for this to kick in but eventually you may see the results dont take my advice if you feel its a bad idea :), also the flaw in my plan is that some  (only a few) froiends will leave you thinking what thew girl said was true, but they may eventually come back when every one else sees how you feel.

The reason he canceled his plans is that he's getting some.<br>  The phone answering business just shows that he's not into you.  <br>  <br>  Also, what kind of man answers a phone call from him mom while getting a bj?<br>  <br>  He sounds like a momma's boy.<br>  Red flags for sure.<br>  <br>  My guess is that he's raised by a single mom (or a domineering mom).  Treating other women poorly is his way of getting back at him mom... however, being raised by a single mom he knows how to woo the girls.  It's sort of an oedipus thing.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Honestly dont listen to people who says "just let him do it". If your uncomfortable with it then talk to him about it. He may just like the go boost and if your okay with that then let it go, but if your not then confront him. Talking and explaining is the number 1 thing in relationships. Let him know how you feel. If he's as sweet and considerate as you say he'll talk to you about it and you'll find a way to resolve it. Maybe he doesnt even realize it bothers you.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	No honey, this guy is just tied to being a business man than anything else.

Some people are just the type to answer the phone when it rings.  I don't think this is a red flag for anything.   <br>  <br>  However, if this is something that bothers you, just talk to him about it (nicely).  I personally don't ignore phone calls in these types of situations unless I'm REALLY in the heat of the moment.  What if he's expecting an important call?  For some people, this type of temporary distraction might break the mood.  In any case, it definitely shouldn't make or break your relationship.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|m9rK9dT6aa	Take her off into a corner and tell her how you feel. <br>  IF she has a confused face just stop there and walk away.<br>  But if she seems interested and shocked keep on going and then ask her out.<br>  If she says no it's a no.<br>  Be strong there are more fishes in the ocean.
VSVQHKwKaa	No...but the sloppy nature of her husband and children is a symptom of her REAL problem.<br>  <br>  She feels trapped and disappointed.<br>  <br>  Here is what she was really saying:<br>  <br>  " I work very hard and spend 8-10 hours everyday away from the home. This makes me feel guilty because nothing in my life is in order. And I'm too afraid to make the commitment to stay home and keep an orderly household, teach the children to be cleaner, and have the time to live like a civilized person. <br>  <br>  I'm embarrassed to bring people over. Now I explained to my husband that, since I was doing half of his role (Breadwinner) he is AUTOMATICALLY obligated to fulfill half of my role (Home-maker). <br>  <br>  But he doesn't! He says he doesn't want to. It's not a priority to him!<br>  <br>  So now I'm in conflict with my husband because he sees me as his COMPETITOR, we have no love life, the kids are a mess because both of us are away from them too long, and all I get is a paycheck that is too quickly spent and an office job I can be fired from next week.<br>  <br>  And I feel unfulfilled.<br>  <br>  And for some reason, I can't figure out why I feel that way."<br>  <br>  That's what she was saying.<br>  <br>  Your response:<br>  <br>  Well what did you think was going to happen when you went down this road? Did you think Homes just clean themselves? Do you think errands, appointments, recitals, sport games, shopping, and school problems resolved themselves?  Do you think children raised themselves?<br>  <br>  If not...what exactly are you doing here in this office?<br>  <br>  That's what you should say.|`|2eoAqicdaa	sounds like she needs someone to talk to right now<br>  she doesnt sound happy... if you do talk about it try and stay well back and dont get dragged into it all|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Ask her.|`|cCJvsEPsaa	You were her sounding board.

ChpS0laRaa	it sounds like your friend has taken a step back to make sure she isn't stepping on anyones toes but then at the same time this guy is having his cake and eating it too, <br>  Dont let this guy come between you and your friend, speak to her and see if anything has happened between then and how she feels about the two of you being together <br>  it may be a difficult thing to do but it could save you alot of hurt and a friendship in the long run,<br>  <br>  Good luck

It's a sign of things to come.  You want to be celibate for life?<br>  <br>  2.  He may have a sexual problem caused by who knows what that he doesn't want to tell you about.  Weird religious hangups, phsyical problems whatever (I mean, who cares?  it's his problem and he should fix it.)  I recommend you work out what you're going to do wrt your future, what risks you can run, and then say to him 'listen feller me lad, join a monastery or see a doctor, but I didn't sign up for lifelong celibacy.  Sort your shinola out, or see ya later."  <br>  <br>  Don't fall for any weeping 'but I love you's or 'I'll change's - get a real outcome.  don't settle for anything that doesn't work for you.<br>  <br>  And do it now before one of his one-shot wonders gets you pregnant and you're stuck with this garbage for life, with no chance of leverage or bargaining power.  Maybe he doesn't really fancy you.  Maybe he';s gay.  Maybe he's a necrophiliac and your blood temperature is too high.  Who knows, I say, and who cares?  It's irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Ask him if he wants to play any games.  You never know.  Show up with a whip.  I mean, who knows?

It will not go away.|`|gOo2DFMUaa	i hardly believe he's gay. I think he just has a low sex drive, AND POSSIBLY a late bloomer. not all guys have to look at porn and masterbate.

If he is working 12 hour+ days, he's exhausted, he's stressed. He's trying to show his love to you and your family by working harder. I know it makes no sense, but read the book "How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It." It will open your eyes. <br>  <br>  I know it makes you sad to be apart from him. But is it possible to bring the kids to his job and have a picnic on his lunch break? Make him feel special. Take the focus away from what he's not doing and show YOUR appreciation by doing something for him without an expectation that he'll make 1 day a week an 'off day.' It may work wonders. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Vu42CXYZaa	My dad was like this but unfortunately it didn't work out for my parents :( although he did become more active in my life after the divorce.

Don't forget how much he loves u! and I'll be praying for u! <br>  <br>  John 3:16 - u may have heard this and maybe even a lot but this is So true!  also there is so much more wonderful examples of Gods love for us in The Bible pick it up and see! ;)|`|wp5TjXT4aa	Tell him that you are willing to negotiate. He can work 6 days without you complaining about it if he is willing to give you just one day. What's the since in working all the time if you are working toward nothing. most people work to provide for their family. Providing for your family includes giving them quality time time with you.  when your chldren grow into adults, if you ask them what they would have changed about their childhood, they are more likely to say they wish they had more time with their family than " I wish I would have had an extra pair of name brand shoes  in fifth grade".<br>  Creating memories is'nt always about money. It's about letting your family know that they come first. If he lost his job (or business) he would replace it. If he lost his family, that is something that can never be replaced.<br>  Bring these points to his attention. Good luck!

But, it can take many forms like; fantasies of another lover, emotional relationship with another, hidden fetishes, using toys, etc., Or it may depend on what your boyfriend's definition of cheating is. Who knows, he might be open-minded, and freaky by nature. So, it may be acceptable, or alright with him. But, if not, you got to regain his trust, and share yourself with him, and no one else. If you would of done this as to fulfill his sexual fantasy, or with his permission, than that wouldn't be cheating.|`|L9QckBC4aa	Sorry to say so, but it's cheating.<br>  It doesn't matter if you're best friends and that you're both girls, if you couldn't tell your boyfriend then it means you were deceitful and cheated.|`|PLsJpPqOaa	yess..... that's not nice and your bf needs to know or else there could be some huge issues later on in your relationship.<br>  :)|`|0eorp2Hhaa	eeeeeeeew|`|JJMa25NWaa	uh, yeah. that is cheating..|`|ZNfWnQjlaa	where is a policeman when you need one?|`|XeLZtw20aa	yes, but I don't get why you would do that|`|Ek2INE3Kaa	I guess that if you guys don't have feelings for each other and you were just having fun or whatever, it might not be considered cheating.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot. <br>  Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you. <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name. <br>  Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her. <br>  Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction. <br>  Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you. <br>  Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you. <br>  Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you. <br>  Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it.|`|3NdBYdlOaa	okay if a girl intentionally flirts in front of you, shes probably trying to make you jelous,so try to get her attention,dont act as if it bothers you(its a sign of weakness)|`|MxjLiFm0aa	check out how she acts around other guys..<br>  if theres no difference.. then shes just a flirt..<br>  if youre special.. GO FOR IT :D<br>  and good luck|`|z8ecdbX2aa	Girls tend to be flirtacious, but there's a huge difference between flirting&liking. You'd know if she liked you, trust me.|`|yPKrBiIhaa	we'll it really depends... if she's gone out wit pple b4 den ask around but if not then you could always take a chance...girls like the risk takers.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	how could you not tell? we need more details. have you guys had any sort of conversations lately? fill us in bro.|`|D5ZxZWXjaa	ahaha, she probably likes you. there probably are no such pple who "massively" flirt and not like you.  good luck :P|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	well, if she's a massive flirt with just you, yes, she likes you.
eYxAMRwPaa	I feel bad for your situation.. but on the other hand Its kinda comical...     your husbands MOS, whatever it might be, is constantly going to have other females around.. you're gonna HAVE to get used to that!    next thing, you cant go writing letters to people about a mean girl who you want to be punished.. your husband is gonna do alot of push ups that way.. you'll soon find that the army seldom cares about your personal issues and if you take there time with them.. your husband is the one who will pay the price. If there is one thing commanding officers hate, its a soldier with a nagging wife.. so make sure you keep your hubby out of the "front leaning rest position" (push ups) and don't write the letter :)    as long as your man did the right thing who cares, whores will be whores no matter what you do, you cant control anything in the army.. the sooner you come to realize this, the happier you and your family will be    next thing, GO INFANTRY 11B hooah|`|ipWRgKetaa	Army or no, are you going to make it your life's mission to follow your husband around and beat up all the girls that approach him? Whether he's in the army or not, you cannot live amongst human beings and not be 'hit on' by someone of the opposite sex from time to time. I'm sure guys have hit on you, does your husband react by wanting to attack them? I'd hope not. I'd hope you'd say 'No thanks' just as he would.     Bottom line, she's a girl, being a girl...perhaps a somewhat aggressive one, but you can't build a cage around him. You have to learn to trust him and trust your relationship since in reality that is the only real security you have.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	I think that you should be real clear on why this bothers you so much first.  Do you think that something might happen between her and your husband?  Do you trust him?  If you do then feel sorry for her that she will never get what she wants.  If you don't trust him then maybe that is the real problem...|`|KILFoc6kaa	There seems to be at least one in every co-ed group. My husband I are both prior Navy and went through basic training, he was male only I was coed, oh the things I could tell you.....still makes me shudder.    Someone will find out how she is acting, and she will be dealt with. They notice these things and will eventually deal with them but it may take little while. Unfortunately you writing a letter may cause more problems, because they may question him as to why he didn't report it, and get on his case, the last thing one needs in basic.    The good thing is that you trust your husband and that's what matters.  She will get hers, and it will probably come from the other girls, and it probably wont be pretty.|`|nKosOzuVaa	Sad, sounds like she is desperate for attention. I wonder what happened in her life to make her that way. Good that he feels comfortable enough to tell you about this. Weird that he would bring it up at all.  I'd be upset about it, but I'm also a bit insecure about myself & my relationship. You're bound to be upset about it because you're not there and it's completely out of your control.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I feel you.. My husbands in the military and has had girls in the military flirt with him. It pisses me off to no end! If I saw the girl she wouldn't be happy! I trust my husband...it's OTHER people you have to worry about! I don't think it should be co-ed either. that's just dumb!|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Allow your husband to do what all men and women must learn to do from time to time throughout their lifetimes, allow him to resist the devil. But don't you dare take this up with his base commander, you will cause him untold repercussions if you do.    I respect your being defensive for your husband and furious for the one girl, but men will cross the paths of immoral girls or women throughout their lifetimes, and the best punishment for these immoral girls and women is rejection by the man. Trust him... Isn't that what you promised to do during your wedding vows?|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Sounds like he handled it o.k. Don't make a big deal about it, as she is just seeking attention. Since your husband ignored her, she will move on to some one else.|`|AA11089526	First off.....he is a liar.....if she did in fact say that to him, he smiled and toyed with the idea to flirt back or he acted on it....don't be a fool.  Get the facts first.    Why are you so angry?  Is trust an issue here?  mmmmmmmmmmmm, jealousy.....your behavior doesn't sound like someone that can control themselves or others but seems as though you have a very controlling personality.|`|79wOWoM0aa	You are definitely too worked up about this.      I'm sorry... is telling someone they're hot against the rules in the military?  Really... you need to refocus your energy elsewhere.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	I think it's understandable that you would be upset but from my perspective you are really going overboard. You are only making yourself sound like a fool and lowering yourself to the level of this girl.    If you trust your husband then you could laugh it off. There are going to be people like her anywhere.    And I think your statement "This is exactly why it should not be co-ed!" is narrow-minded, sexist, and puts all women in the same category as this one girl. You should stick up for your own gender more and realize that there are people like her of both genders in all settings.    Relax, take a chill pill, and if you do trust your husband have a good laugh and be glad he was honest with you.    Now if you don't trust him that could explain some of your irate attitude more....maybe you feel threatened? Maybe you are NOT so sure of your husband's fidelity?|`|rvviZvOSaa	I don't think you should write to them, you'd seem just a desperate housewife...I know, it's annoying but your husband should make that report if he wants. But even with that, I don't know how much things can be changed, I guess that it's not the worst behavior that could appear...    Maybe I'm just seeing things from the point of view that most people in my country see it, here people make reports only if it's something really really bad or dangerous, and even then, nothing changes.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Army was always like this. And these few sentences are just better than a homosexual provocation. Your husband will handle the situation the best way.|`|X3MVUemWaa	He is in the Army and is going to be dealing with this, just let it go. My husband was in the Army, he dealt with it to, some woman are there to chase men and you have to accept this. She is one of many, just be glad your husband acted the way he should and let it go. It is not worth wasting your time even thinking about. She won't be the last since your guy is good looking so don't embarrass him by over reacting about a stupid comment.|`|n1zRjbk5aa	It is all normal to be upset about that, it's like the opposite happened, your husband would feel the same. But I think you should not contact the ones in charge, let this be forgotten, you must be feeling lucky for your good man and his excellent behaviour.|`|iTtxlvZcaa	he handled hinself as he should.....now if he would of crossed t/line then u have an issue but not w/her w/him.....as long as handles himself t/way he should ur ok|`|XQnF8h6xaa	I think you are just jealous and a little insecure. I also think this girl is out of line. my husband and I had to be separated once for 2 months because of his job. I was very jealous and insecure over the whole thing. Bottom line is just trust him.|`|dKh7z0ZWaa	I think you should calm down and trust your husband, i think he deserves it. if you are sure that your husband wont entertain this mini girl problem then just calm down your husband know the right thing.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	Don't do anything.  You are upset, so you are going to want to retaliate.  Your husband is trustworthy.  He told you about the incident and did the right thing by ignoring her.  If it become a huge problem, and consistent, then do something about it.
K3snVnk7aa	yeah i wud and i already have like 2 or 3 I think     i was tought that the only race is the human race i love any women     i dont discriminate    : )|`|fnV6HjYGaa	why not? :D|`|B7WIZdglaa	Hmm. I would like to answer this w/out being too offensive or sounding racist..which i'm NOT! I think typically, white guys would date mixed girls more (black and white/ black and chinese/etc), if she acted like a white girl. Typical, normal white guys do not like those ghetto black girls. Their too much. Too much drama, too mouthy, just too much. I wouldn't wanna put up w/it. Thats why alot of black guys date white girls, because we're more eager to please them (I dont just mean sexually). I think nothing is sexier than a black woman who is educated and speaks intelligently.. If I was a guy i'd date one! There is nothing sexy about ghetto black OR white girls who sound unintelligent and can't pronounce their words correctly.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	I just dont like how black girls look.  Maybe i seen ONE 1/2 and 1/2 white/black girl that was decent, but really... Black just don't do it for me.    Even that "most sexiest girl alive", she was in that james bond movie, holly berry? I dont know... just ugly to me.    edit:   Just to be clear, for thos white guys that say NO.  It it NOT cause the person is black  But cause the guy thinks the girl is not attrictive...  The person  just HAPPENS to be black.    edit:  Sad.. how can you get a thumbs down by being honest and stating what was asked.  So i have to lie and state i think black girls are hot?  Sad, you guys are the real racists of this world....|`|O5cEFIofaa	I'm not trying to be racist but white guys aren't attracted to black women, yeah sure we all like rihanna and beyonce etc.. but white guys aren't interested in the average black woman.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	i would date african american. im white british and think african women are sexy.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I would, if the lady in question has dating potential.    So far, i have yet to meet one.
MxHRjPFHaa	porn is like smoking its very hard to stop...     some men just love to watch it,its not a crime he lies to you because he thinks it will hurt your relationship with him,thats why he lies about it...I am sure he loves you and is trustfulll with you....there are classes out there he can take to overcome this if he will go............you can even go with him to show him support and love....try it....|`|bO2rzfISaa	Do you feel better now? If your husband is lying to you about a sexual issue, you've got a problem. I doubt that your friends would be jealous of that.    You're smart to remove access to the computer. This website might be helpful to you.    http://pornaddicthubby.com/    You seem to be trying really hard to convince yourself how great he and your marriage are. Don't be blind to what he's done because you want this to be perfect. You can't make him love or respect you. You can't make him trustworthy. If you were abused your judgment about him might be affected by that. If this continues please seek help.    Don't forget that he can access the computer a number of other places.|`|bZud91iuaa	Well young lady, I think you need some help.  I'm not a psychologist but you're doing a lot of rationalizing here.  Inherently there is nothing wrong with porn as long as it is not used for abuse.  You're newly weds, 21, and he looks at porn, so what's he missing.  Then there's all this stuff about church and praying which indicates some guilt around this whole thing.  Then it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself that everything's going well.      Hey, rent a couple of movies and maybe you'll find that it helps with the excitement of the moment.  And according to you you're hotter than those babes anyway, so you must have seen some mags and pics to make the comparison.  Hey, make your own video and spice it up a little for you both.|`|a8ro1lXKaa	why are we supposed to care?    This isn't the place for this|`|IcH5gMICaa	Hey, I got reemed the other day bc I asked why these insanely huge obese people were making fun of me -and all these fat people were like "hey I'm fat and maybe they weren't making fun of you bc they were fat"!  It was insane bc they WERE bc they were mad I wouldn't give their fat a$$e$ some cigarettes.  They had me thrown out of the bar and as soon as the manager walked over, they left and didn't even state WHY they were asking if I could leave when they were already leaving.  Fat A-hols|`|IF95rI2aaa	I didnt get to read your first one, however, just work it out....and good luck!  :)|`|W0KQTXrvaa	what is wrong with all these men going crazy with porn?|`|MvAyYyv3aa	Let him look at the porn with your approval and he wont lie about it.he may even get closer to you.Mildred is my leader.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	oh ...mannnnnnnnnnnnnn    now i'm gonna have to take a road trip to see him if  ya can't let me TALK to him ..........

QCmRRbABaa	Time to end counseling, and start to act, in your own.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Pay that counselor double for their help and go find a male pussycat!|`|RvFwmQOPaa	I would get another counselor because that is very disrespectful and unprofessional. You must be with your significant other for a reason or you wouldn't be there.|`|aSn5Vz8Gaa	get a new counselor|`|IpkUUxdNaa	If you are seriously asking and looking for help with your marriage then I would be getting a new counselor or at the very least in the next session ask why he/she said that and in front of your wildbeest.|`|AA11871047	well two things can happen... either the  counsellor is interested in u or well ur partner is really a wildbeast...  and for the former u can hit the counsellor and for the latter u leave ur partner|`|IcH5gMICaa	I would take their advice unless you felt like the counselor was attracted to you.  If that was the case, then I'd find another counselor and continue working on it.  Most people never even make it to couples counseling.    And is he a wildebeast?  Do you feel like you could do better?  Because once someone puts that idea in your head, it's going to be hard to get out.  And if he is a wildebeast...is he a NICE one?|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	he did, after 1 visit he told me to just get divorced...|`|29hcn9JRaa	Typically, a good qualified therapist or counselor would never speak negative about a persons spouse, it is not their job to infest your brain and frame of mind with negative words, however if this counselor feels that your spouse is a threat and your life is at risk, he or she may do so out of sheer worry for your life? But if you simply have just a jerk for a husband and is of no physical threat to you or anyone else, this counselor crossed the line, maybe you may want to think of finding a new counselor?|`|ppF6oSCQaa	Leave the counselor.  He's a quack.|`|282b63c09da8e149a4194accaf494760aa	No one is all good or all bad. I would consider a different counselor and tell the counselor you were surprised by her comment and felt it reflects an attitude that 'joins' with you blaming your partner for the whole relationship issue(s) perhaps and you need someone who can see the strengths in both of you and help you appreciate them in each other as well as looking at the wounds/weaknesses that you each need to take ownership of. Unless there is abuse in your relationship that you refuse to see and is markedly impacting you, I can not imagine justifying that blunt and 'all or nothing' comment as a therapist personally...some good books to read BTW: Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix (for couples) and Boundaries In Marriage and perhaps in your case, Boundaries Face to Face by Henry Cloud and John Townsend I believe.  Name calling/labeling is never helpful.|`|oMHUyMndaa	Eddie... U R hilarious!|`|fbc51fefdf8f90a690cd87fb91f16194aa	I would tell them that any advice they have to offer is supposed to be given during the session, not after, and to keep the personal judgements to themselves. Then I would find a new counsellor.    The point of counselling is not to force the couple to stay together, nor to force them apart, no matter what the counsellor may think of either person. It's their job to show the couple how to work through their problems. It's then up to the couple, and no one else, whether they can do this or give up.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Well, I cannot believe that a trained professional counselor would say that, however, if they did I would find another counselor who would actually try and help me with our problems instead of wondering why I was with them.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I would leave. It is that simple. Some people can't or won't change.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I would give him/her a ten dollar tip and run to the attorney to file the petitions.  You have the blessings of the counselor, so your finally free to be the man you've always wanted.  A divorced dad, paying child support, and a home mortgage that you no longer live in, your ex-wife shapes up and turns out to be more attractive than ever and you get to go home to your one room apartment and have a frozen dinner type of guy.  Good luck with that.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	the counselor is dead wrong this was improper and he should be reported for this conduct
Rb087BsAaa	Your boyfriend will be gone in 4 months anyway.  Don't use him as an excuse.|`|l5NzJZ6Zaa	u should go|`|N4JUrdbsaa	Well...this is indeed a difficult situation, and I feel rather badly about giving you the answer. This is more a personal choice, but if you do wish for my advice, I'd have to say do what you feel is best.     Don't worry about your boyfriend, or your family, worry about yourself. I know it sounds selfish, but look at it like this: if you're suffering, you won't be able to help. But if you're fine and well, then...well, you get the idea.
Xosu35K7aa	i believe that is sterio typing.  im pretty (not being on myself) & im one of the nicest people! and alot of people hate me for no reason.  i know alot of un attractive people who are very stuck up & think there the best thing since sliced bread.  i dont think the way you act is based on your looks.|`|aamZbp5Maa	alot of popular girls ( not all) act bitchy because they feel that is the only way they will get noticed. They feel that if thye are quiet and keep to the side everyone will forget about them and they will end up unhappy and bing picked on. Some people dont notice they are being bitchy, yet again it isnt just popular's it can be anyone. Everyone gets a bit cranky.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	It can be argued that good looking people have it easier; they're accepted and everyone knows that people are more likely to like pretty people rather than ugly people (sad, but true.) After a lifetime of being wanted and popular, they feel licensed to make everyone else feel like crap. Don't pay for her phone.|`|lhMpqDS3aa	Lol. My friend says apparently I look good and the first time she saw me she thought I was a ***** (just based on looks). However, when she talked to me, she found I wasn't at all and now we're best friends. XD; Not all good-looking girls act bitchy. She doesn't.

NOT BLAMING U FOR THE CHARGER, THAT WAS HER FAULT NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHERE SHE LEAVES HER  S H I T .

THEYRE OUT THERE.|`|22Qa8PtJaa	Cos we have to ward off the flies buzzing around us. There's nothing worse than catching a creepy guys eyes by accident because he doesn't stopping staring like a crazy stalker.    But in your situation, I think it had nothing to do with looks, she was just a pure *****, and apparently not very bright. At least you got to talk to a hot girl, right?
5LEE91CGaa	1. bc if she's strong enough then she will pick her self up from no. 3. if she has other people that care enough like i would they would help her realize that she needs to wake up. but with no. 1 she would have a dominant male figure to stand up against the guy so i could beat the beeyotch out of him.|`|wVnVKxTAaa	3.

kBSlNEL2aa	I think it does...I mean look at Lil Wayne, 50 cent, Snoop dogg...you think those guys would have gotten laid if it wasn't for all the money...NOT!|`|wZvbotxtaa	The question is vague however I will try to answer this the best I can.  I have dated men in the past with minimal material things to offer and still he remained attractive due to his inner qualities and strong sense of self and the confidence he exuded while we where together.  They may have had talents like being a musician, an artist, or they were extremely intelligent could hold a conversation that kept my interest over time.  I have also dated men who had many material things and money to spend and found myself completely turned off because they defined themselves with the material things and money they accumulated, and bragged constantly about the fact they had money.  Big turn off.  All that to say... if you have money and you do not identify yourself worth or value to that fact...it is very attractive.  Falling in love with someone you are compatible with is always a wonderful feeling regardless of what material things the person may or may not possess...and if that person happens to be rich, there's the bonus!|`|0gdBjXb1aa	lol  no...just as ugly...and a little better off financially    **i starred that  :)|`|SS1FFafRaa	Steve - your friend is stupid for even having to ask this question.  seriously.  he may need to be checked for mental retardation.

As long as I could keep it when we're done.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Ya....  If i am flashing my money around and paying for stuff, i get noticed by alot of girls, and alot more will talk to me.

e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Ask how you could help him, don't be afraid to offer some advice. Compliment him about the good things he's done, how you make him feel.  Keep it light, don't get so serious in the conversation. Yeah and since Hearts day is coming up you can get him a gift that expresses your feelings to him.  If he wants to be alone right now, let him be.  Just let him know that you're just there to support him.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	if you tell him he has a big penis ...this should get you EXTRA brownie points =)|`|y2nC8BUGaa	My guy loves to hear that he's handsome.  Hugs are always good, and comfort food.|`|0zsuEjQvaa	Basically, you being there for him should help a lot. A lending ear and a laugh now and then shouldn't be over the top. But if he want to be on his own, then leave him to be. Men need their 'me time' such as us girls do! Plus Valentine's Day is coming up - you can go over the top then! :)
ZSznCJhSaa	Well, first of all, if other people are drinking but you want to keep your cool... it doesn't matter if you drink or not. You can act goofy or outgoing and such and because they are drunk they wont reply with awkwardness.    But the big thing to remember is that no one cares what you are doing really, they are all to busy thinking about themselves and how they are acting and so on and so forth. Everyone is too caught up in their own world. Just remember, the only time people look down on others for making a mistake or doing something awkward is when that person isn't confident about it.   If you do something crazy but act like you dont give a sh** then everyone else will think "wow, that guy is so confident!"    Its all about bravado, Just force yourself to do something over the top, get a little crazy first and then tone it down to where you want to be.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Take up acting.|`|QS1cQEdaaa	well, what kind of shy are you?   If you only shy around girls/guys - find the source of your shyness, are you comfortable with what you look like and what you do and who you are?    Remember people are drawn to others who look confident and comfortable with themselves!   Try looking in the mirror and find the best part of you, the part you like the best eg your smile, coz if you like it, others are bound to like it too !   Try starting up a conversation with complete strangers , eg. if your waiting in a queue start up a conversation with the guy behind you, it can be about the most arb thing...just think to yourself - is this person ever going to see you again???
8pw8qDjPaa	if he has a girlfreind then that means hands off for you!!! you have no right to interfer in their relationship in anyway, you gotta let nature take its course. if you two are meant to be ever then eventually they'll break up, but don't interfer and make them break up cuz that's bad karma for you! and besides, if he cheats on his girlfriend or if he breaks up with his girlfriend just for you, are you really interested in that? that just means he could turn around and do the same thing to you. not saying he is going to, but i'm just throwing that out there. you need to keep your distance or you're going to get a lot of drama and possibly hurt some people in the process.|`|4nZb9oqKaa	this is hard.. try 2 move on u cant exactly tell him how u feel ask ur parents about it
f7l9byFGaa	I would go for the smart guy.  I would like to have a decent conversation with a guy who knows what I am talking about.  The guys with the muscles will probably lose those muscles in years to come but the smart guy will always be smart.|`|76nTvO4iaa	It depends whether I was looking for a hook up or a relationship.

MHwn4Tlzaa	He is testing you to see how far you will let him go.  It starts with the butt and progresses.  Tell him he needs to keep his hands to himself.  Save yourself for marriage.  True Love waits!|`|QRWqplREaa	u've never asked urself "where should i put my hands?"  he picked a spot.|`|UONwTWIQaa	men love a$$ and t!ts!!! thats all there is to it!!! i love my man's a$$ too!|`|b67fnOlMaa	give it up to him and ull be fine|`|AA12159712	If you gave him indications that you like it either by telling him or by your actions when he does it, then it encourages him to do it all the more, since he thinks he's going to get you hotter and wanting all the more sexual touching to lead up to you wanting intercourse. Only natural for a guy to pursue getting some action if you show encouragement.|`|wVnVKxTAaa	Of course!!! Don't waste a second wondering if it's normal.... savor the moment instead! =)|`|K3snVnk7aa	its perfectly normal hes pry just a little to horney hes trying to progress things a little past kissing thts why hes doing it lol

IkWcwsj8aa	he loves you|`|Vhq3GURQaa	If you have a  boyfriend why are you holding hands with another guy?  Yes, he still has feelings. You have not ended it. If you are holding hands with him you are sending mixed signals.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	That he likes macaroni and cheese.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	yeah that means he likes u n feels close to u, u should be lucky :)|`|S5x6KNHraa	he wants to stroke u|`|YyFexhd3aa	yep|`|OAYaeW22aa	he like ur hands like some guys like feet|`|Gb19X3xVaa	It's a sign of affection|`|Xnw2vTgkaa	It basically means he's playing with your fingers.|`|c0XZx6tuaa	he loves you|`|Bq6ae6nnaa	He's trying to get close to you. He wants to touch you but is shy so he played that silly game with you.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	he likes you girl.....and ya know what, best friends can be the best relationship......you know everything about each other, know what they like, what they don't like, you already have some sort of love for them , even if it's just a friend, you care alot about that person.....who better to share your life with???|`|y07MGbLcaa	he wants you to touch him in dirty places like his butthole its the truth|`|WosBbcViaa	well it means he still has an affection towards u.....

Just b/c you are lonely doesn't mean you need to mess up someone else life just b/c they like you. Even though personality has a lot to do with it you need to be attracted to them also.Remember that this person is nice don't make them loose that.|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	no.<br>  <br>  that's a friend, not a lover.|`|Xly2sF6waa	Is it you just aren't attracted to them or are they unattractive period. If it's the latter then no.|`|HWzUOrBAaa	yea, i'd give it a shot =)|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I would see how it went. But I mean it has to be a mental and physical thing, just not mental.|`|PmT8dPEqaa	Yes!|`|rqyWvkeHaa	Personally I would think about whether or not I could be making problems for myself in the long term. I would think about if this person was a friend, would I want to ruin the relationship possibly or stay friends and not cross over that line. Could be awkward if it turns out that dating them didn't work out.  But then you never know if you could become attracted to them over time. All choices have consequences to them and that's what I'd be thinking about.|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	No, what you just described is a good friend.|`|NBEuxzDBaa	Personality combatability and cooking abillity and ur my new wife|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	ya|`|HsctHlHhaa	just be friends and if you start to get attracted then you can go out with them but you hav to be attracted cos if you break up or sumthin then it will be awkward and that could have been your best friend|`|XjkdUliGaa	ya jst cuz they arent the hottest or sexually attractive doesnt mean they arent great or right for u|`|6kAtYLAdaa	hell no.|`|ZFx9eTiZaa	possibly id have to see<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvUsHM.T9N.8JPv9KUNWJG3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220104148AAFvJK0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>  <--- helpp =[|`|6q1lVVqSaa	ummm... its pretty rare to find that, and the guy will be just to darn perfect and boring. if hes exacly like me<br>  so no.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	no. there has to be chemistry.|`|f17RMVa3aa	nopeee|`|05d6VYAtaa	what the hell are u thinking?!

It's all about your morals and values. Personally, this may sound mean, but I think in order for love to be present, you must be somewhat physically attracted to the person. But there's always the saying, never judge a book by its cover. Maybe you'll find something physical you like in this guy. I think you should give him a try, maybe have a "thing" with him if you get what I am referring to you. Like a relationship, without the title of dating. That way if you want to break up with the guy, you have more of a chance to stay friends. Good luck!|`|cb6ToDZYaa	No, It would be dishonest to enter into a relationship with this person if there is no chemistry.  Your heart is in the right place, and it sounds like you think a lot of this person, but it would be wrong, and trust me, you will end up hurting them because it would never work out.  Also, you would be selling yourself short of a relationship that is complete.  Physical and sexual attraction is not the most important part, but it is essential when your dating someone.  Sounds like you've found a good friend, but it is best for you and them to keep it just friends.  Good luck.|`|AajjvZUPaa	Well for me personally, I think that if you want to have a long relationship with them physical and sexual attraction is an important part of a relationship. But you can try it out and maybe you will gain that attraction from them.|`|iuTn6OwSaa	There's gotta be chemistry. <br>  I'd say they are just gunna be a good friend.<br>  Unless you feel attraction sometime...|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	nah there has to be attraction and sexual chemistry otherwise its just like your mates or brother and sister or something. just stay friends. if you give it a shot and it doesnt work its gonna be awkward and you may have lost a potential great friend.|`|PLsJpPqOaa	ummm... i'm not really sure but i think that if you two were totally compatible that you should at least give it a try. you no?? and i don't think that you HAVE to be attracted to them physically or sexually to go out with them. hope this helps! :)|`|wp5TjXT4aa	If they have all of those other things going for them, they will seem to be more attractive to you anyway. If you are that worried about their appearance, you are too worried about what other people think.|`|lPcT7eFzaa	No. <br>  <br>  I've done that before and that was a horrible relationship. Never will I ever again...<br>  <br>  To ever be able to love someone, you need both emotional and sexual feelings for them.

zAoKd2DBaa	Well there are many things to think about here and whether something is reasonable or not is really subjective, i.e. relevant to an individual's opinions.    It's not unreasonable for you to go off for 2 - 3 weeks a year on the face of it.  But if your girlfriend is unhappy with this, do you want to make her unhappy? shouldn't you talk about it and agree a compromise? could you go for one week?     Would you be happy for your girlfriend to go off for 2 - 3 weeks a year without you? do you two live together? is it a proper relationship or are you just dating, which does make a difference.     Do you have a fixed amount of holiday each year? If you go away for 2 - 3 weeks a year does this mean you only have a small amount of holiday to spend with your girlfriend therefore meaning that you take most of your holidays without her? if so then i think this is unreasonable but if you can dedicate a reasonable amount of holidays to her as well then i don't.      Even if you are dating rather than in a proper relationship this may be a problem that crops up in the future as most women, myself included, like their creature comforts! what is it about your holiday without her that appeals to you? the rambling or the roughing it? there are plenty of holidays you could both go on where you could walk, explore etc during the day but return to a comfortable room at night !     I wouldnt be happy with roughing it, we women care about our appearance (particularly in front of our man) and therefore i'd only be happy to stay one night without showers, etc, although i do like the idea of walking/cycling holidays etc.|`|gZO8tpiYaa	i think not unresonable  its good to have some joint intrests and some individual ones. provides for a healthy relationship.|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	No it's not. If you've made it clear with your g/f that that's what you've always loved doing and does it only once a year and she does not understand, then she needs to be told that she's getting either too possessive or has questionable trust on you.  You may have different likes and it wont hurt if you go with hers but she must also be expecting you'd count her in on yours... Talk about it with her and you'll know how she thinks of it.|`|aJjV5b95aa	No it is not unreasonable, I think that is would be a good thing since you two dont have the same likes when it comes to those kinds of trips. It is always good for two people in a relationship to have something that they like to do with their friends. My bf likes to go trail riding and showing horses (he also works at an Arabian horse farm). Of course I go to some of the local shows but there are times he has to go out of town for a week. He has been doing this for the past year and I think that it has helped us. It has given us a chance to have some time away from each other, but at the same time it has made us closer we both realized that we really want to be together and it has made our relationship stronger.|`|w109EDfmaa	Two to three weeks is a long time for that. just go a week and call it a day. You prolbably wouldn't want her going off for that long so respect that and just hang with your old buddy for a week|`|DZzBfzVeaa	No your not being unreasonable. If you like to be in nature and this is your passion, then your wife shouldnt have a problem with letting you just have a few weeks of doing something  you love to do.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Not at all. I'm not the outdoors roughing it type, so if my husband wanted to go out on an adventure with his buddies for a few weeks I'd let him. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean he can't do it anymore.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	I think it is healthy for the two parties in a relationship to have their individual activities.  2-3 weeks is a long time, but she should be able to handle it as long as she understands that you are being nice to her by not torturing her by making her come along.  It's not an unreasonable request, and I don't see why she would have a problem with it.|`|izbAdDUraa	She should be able to h ave contact with you though. I dont think you are being unreasonable, but, if my fiance were to go hiking/roughing it whatever with you and it was genuinely not some bachelor-shenanigans i would DEFINITELY want a way to communicate with him while he is away. I dont mean you need to take your blackberry with you and email her and IM and text all day, but a phone call once a day, every other day whatever, would be needed.   we worry! especially when our minds are allowed to wonder "what if..."|`|AA11603468	I don't see a problem with that. You enjoy roughing it, she doesn't. It seems like a good solution to go with a friend. She doesn't have to pretend to be enjoying sleeping on the ground, and you get to pursue something you really enjoy.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That depends on your lady friend.    I used to camp out for weeks with my husband, until a back injury made that sort of thing unbearable. (Sleeping on the ground with ruptured discs is not suggested.)    But see if you can't alternate holidays, if the lady proves to part of your future. When I stopped being able to camp out, my husband stopped taking vacations.     Your girlfriend has no reason to object to you taking outings without her. You might have to re-think that if you do the whole "married with kids" things...but for now...enjoy!|`|IcH5gMICaa	Can you take my bf with you too?  I really need about 2-3 weeks away from HIM lol.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	No, I don't think so. I think 3 weeks is quite a long time but we all need time on our own. Perhaps you GF needs to develop some hobbies of her own.|`|8txWayVnaa	If the "reading-between-the-lines" means that your "friend who is big on rambling" is female, than YES!  It is unreasonable!!!    How would you feel if your girlfriend went "off for 2-3 weeks once a year (or less)" with a male friend on a "more relaxing holiday"?    EDIT:    Then no. . .it's not at all unreasonable!  Have a BLAST!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	What I think is reasonable and what she thinks is reasonable may be two different things.  I think it's reasonable. If my husband wanted to do this, I wouldn't complain, but I would miss him.|`|yy45iAbtaa	i don't think so i would not mind and i don't think your girlfriend should mind sometimes that is good for a relationship some time off sometimes 2 people need a break from each other it makes the relationship stronger.if she can't deal with you going camping for 2 weeks that is her own insecurities.|`|LOQMQU8Saa	You need to do what you really love in life. If your gf likes it too, she can join, if not (which is your case) then no problem, it doesn't prevent you from doing it, and isn't a bad thing for your relationship.  If you love and trust each other, I don't think it's bad to get some time off from time to time (3 weeks is not a big deal). It would be unreasonable if you were away every single week end, but once a year is ok IMO.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	Not at all. It's not as if you're going somewhere to do something she really loves and leaving her out. She doesn't care for this type of vacation so you're going with a friend. Makes perfect sense! Maybe she can go on a vacation with one of her friends at the same time!
DSp6zjeGaa	i dont really care about lesbians as long as their cool with me im cool with them, im 21, and i think the reason girls get along with gay guys is because straight guys can be so mean to them that they have no one else to go. and also because girls and gay guys have so much in common

Cause then when that ends, you will have double the hurt and it will keep building up. You need to get over him, and do all the hurting now. It will be woth it. You can 'move on' without moving ONTO a new guy. The new guy seems a bit weird, butmaybe you're messed upcause you still like the ex. GIVE IT TIME, you have your whole life. You don't need to be with anyone. Have fun.    But seriously, you care that much about height? =/

YOU need to see a professional cus of your insecurities    man up and do the right thing and get help so you that in your future when you meet the right girl you dont screw that up too
ppF6oSCQaa	I would say, yes because flirting involves both physical and emotional contact (touching, texting, emailing, verbal exchanges).  When a person touches another, there is immediate physical energy.  And the texting, emailing and other verbal exchanges leads to an emotional relationship.  So in essence, the flirting parties become bonded to each other at some level, therefore it does damage the committed relationship.  Ironically, society often tries to make the other party feel that there is something wrong with them, having feelings of jealousy...etc.  But the best way to determine how damaging it is, is to ask the other person how they feel when they observe their loved one flirting with someone else.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I believe when you are married you should not in anyway flirt with other women because it could turn into something more, same with women.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	depends on if the person flirting or responding to the flirting is married or in another relationship. its a good thing if your single and the other person is too , its the wrong thing to do if others can get hurt by it. flirting is the way all affairs begin, but if your both single it can be the beginning of a beautiful thing.|`|IF95rI2aaa	It really depends on the intensity of flirting... It depends on how far and how long you let it go on.|`|F4d89iRMaa	I agree with answerer  1. You've got to know your limits and make sure everything is HARMLESS!!|`|zAoKd2DBaa	it depends on the couple - more importantly does your man think it's harmless? If he doesn't mind then it is harmless, as long as you don't mind him flirting also.     Personally i think it's out of order if you are in a relationship you should concentrate your time and attention keeping your partner happy and flirting with them. Therefore i would never go out with someone who flirted but that's my opinion.|`|nKosOzuVaa	A little flirting can boost your self esteem and make you feel good.   Too much flirting can be misleading which can lead to hurt feelings.     It all depends on the flirting & the people involved. You can even raise the question as to what is considered flirting. Is it coy looks? Talking? Touching? What is too far?     I have read that men are notorious for taking friendliness for sexual interest when it doesn't actually exist, so I'd think women should use caution if that isn't the impression they want to give.     I have also read women tend to be more sensitive, if a man flirts and shows her interest she might be disappointed to learn he really wasn't interested.    I know if my guy spent too much time flirting with another it would give me pause, but on the other hand if someone flirted with me I'd find it an ego boost. I wouldn't want to flirt excessively with a guy who might think I was interested in taking things further.|`|hbMNhuFVaa	no, its a natural feeling that you cant hide but you need to control it.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	There are limitations to flirting.  It's okay until it goes too far.    For instance, you can talk all day long, but when it gets to where you are holding secret conversations, that's when it's gone too far.|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	When you get too attached to the one you're flirting with, yes...|`|Vkf6t4wfaa	I personally believe that married men  are open game  for women, either married or single .    I see it every where I go with my husband. The women are the ones doing the flirting .They don't care if the wife or girl friend is present or not. Yes, it can cause hurt feelings... No one should ever have to go through  feelings of unworthiness from another human being--- man or female.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	There are different types of flirting. I flirt with everyone, so they all know its just innocent friendly flirting. But if I were to only flirt with a of couple girls, and lead one of them on, then that might lead to hurt feelings.    There is this  girl I work with. She is always flirting with this guy, but he is a little slow.. We always tell her its wrong but she is leading him on and that is leading to hurt feelings. There is a huge difference.
0IZ2SYmYaa	You shouldn't get revenge on her because that makes you just as bad as she is. Just simply ignore her and stop being her friend.|`|oTlWb4Wvaa	INVITE HER FOR A SLEEPOVER! and be SUPER NICE  then, when shes asleep, get everyone and play tricks on her and take pics or videos... like for example, making her pee (put one hand in hot water, one hand in cold) then show them to ppl... make sure the teachers dont find out.. or u could get in SERIOUS trouble for cyber bullying|`|EtQ1iK5saa	rip that *****'s weave out.

bO2rzfISaa	Cham is so righteous and indignant. He's some sort of authority (Like a paralegal) so he thinks he understands the law in all 50 states. He doesn't sound like a parent, though.     Why would anyone want two children to be unsupervised with a drug addict? That's the crux of the issue here.    I have no idea how you should proceed. It seems that you're able to afford an attorney, and you should get one. Good luck. Sometimes all kids have is one devoted grandparent.    EDIT: Cham: I don't offer legal advice because I'm not an attorney EITHER. You're arrogant, that's what I object to. I've seen your answers for weeks, and you're particularly arrogant as you answer this question. It's hard to imagine that a good parent would think it a safe plan to leave two children with someone facing drug charges. It is my humble (perhaps you've heard of this word) opinion that I offer. When you pass the bar you will be qualified to berate the rest of us on Y!A with your legal finesse. Right now you're just some guy who read a book.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Since your son left the state has only a 1 bedroom apartment and can't even financially support himself, I don't see how he thinks he can get them back.  If she is still on drugs, is unemployed and has only seem them 5 times in the last 10 months, I don't know how she could get them either. They may both be awarded visitation though.  To be on the safe side, I would definitely invest in a good family law attorney. It sounds like you have a good case, but a lawyer would be better able to answer your questions and tell you what you need to do to prove their unfitness as parents.|`|TfijWwsYaa	It won't be too hard, but you must get a good lawyer.  I would do that ASAP, lawyers can give good advice for free so even if you can't hire one I would at the least speak with one.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You have 2 standards to meet and prove in order for custody to be changed in Georgia.     (1) parental custody would harm the child; AND    (2) granting custody to the grandparent will promote the child's health, welfare and happiness. A grandparent has a more difficult legal standard to meet than does a parent when seeking custody of a child.    Right now, you may be able to prove that custody with mom would harm the child, but you can't with dad...he wins by default, and you just wasted thousands of dollars, ruined the relationship you had with your child, the possibility of maintaining a relationship with your grandchildren other than through court order, and single handedly self destructed your own family.    You may want to think really hard before you make your next move.      1. Who filed the suit?  2. What were the pleadings?  3. How did YOU come into the picture as a party to the suit?    You can't just walk up to the court and ask for a modification, there has to be a motion, petition, SOMETHING filed with the court to start proceedings.     So again, WHAT SUIT WAS FILED??    Saying that you don't deny them access and then saying she can't keep HER kids over the weekend is contradictory...or did you not notice that?    Edit for Ouragon:    So arrogance to you is telling someone that they are obviously LYING and further they are committing a criminal act? So you'd rather me agree with everyone else that responded wishing her well in pursuing instead of falling deeper into thought and questioning the contents of her statements?    Sorry, you can call it arrogant if you want, but I can tell you one thing for certain. The MAJORITY of those that you consider are being berated on this forum are being told the truth. They find out one of two ways that it is the truth. By listening to what I have to say and emailing me with the proper ways to proceed, or emailing me after the fact and saying "you were right". I am effective at what I do and knowledgeable about my passion. I don't apologize for telling the truth in a fashion that doesn't suit the emotional needs of others. The law isn't nice about things, it is simply that, the law. If they want emotionally charged, inaccurate, "nice" advice...then maybe they should consult you behind the scene through email. Otherwise, they open themselves up to whatever responses they get.    I may not be an attorney as of yet, but I have met all the requirements ALREADY to receive my Juris Doctorate, which  is a Professional Doctorate in law. What credentials do you bring to the table?    I didn't just read a book, I earned a degree. An educated person would know the difference...especially one that earned a degree. ;)    As a parent, deeply thinking litigator...I understand that this person has lied throughout her post and is seeking emotional satisfaction as well as a corrupt way to gain custody of her grandkids.    Edit:    Thank you.     Temporary guardianship is NOT custody. The mother has rights to the children, even more so than you do as a guardian because she is a parent. There are two operating orders, one establishing you as temp guardian in the absence of your son, and the other would be their divorce decree which has the visitation order in it.    As the guardian, you are to abide by the visitation order established by the court in your son's divorce decree. You can be held liable as their guardian for disregarding the order, so I'd get my hands on it and find out the explicit terms governing mom's visitation.    Still my answer remains the same as to your ability to attain custody. You have not met the requirements to gain custody per GA state law.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	I would have a good lawyer who represents you and you would have plenty of legal options to explore with gaining custody|`|IF95rI2aaa	If the mother has gotten her life back on track, i would at least let her see them visit them and see how it works out. However, from her past and your sons i think you have nothing to worry about and they may give you full custody. I wish you luck,|`|MvAyYyv3aa	This is a difficult choice. It is a choice between your life and freedom or the future lives of your grandchilden. I would chose the children. Someone needs to love them. Mildred is my leader|`|MxHRjPFHaa	thats a big court issue...bring it all up in court ,you will not loose the kids at all,they will look at her past history and her current history....You might make them very mad at you but who cares its for the best of the kids...........Go for it you file first dont let them it will look better for you once you get to court this might take a year to get the final judgement..but you will end up with the kids|`|4HoVVCenaa	You will have to prove, beyond doubt, that this is better for the children. It can be done, but the burden of proof is on you. It will be a long hard road. Start by keeping records of contacts on how they react to things.

vQy7V6ZMaa	Talk to your aunt about it. Since your grandmother raised your aunt I have a feeling she went through the same thing. Your grandmother probably gave your aunt a hard time too. I am sure your Aunt knows your not obnoxious and even if she doesn't know that if you take the time to sit down with her and ask for advice she will know your not. Best of luck!|`|7mq8eYJgaa	it happens to people at old age.. dont worry.|`|qLBU4t9Zaa	If you sense any tension coming from your aunt, then you need to talk to her about it and let her know how you feel about everything.

My grandma is like old-school conservative, you know the kind that thinks even herself shouldn't be treated equally as a man? yeah, that's her. I'm a guy however, but she thinks i'm a punk teen. She always assumes i'm backtalking her and disrespecting her so she tells my whole family. Usually it ends up going to my uncle and he talks to me. bottom line is grandma is right untill you prove it otherwise. Your aunt loves you, she'll most likely talk to you about it and tell her your side of what's going on. and to help butter things up...apologize to your grandma, even if it seems wrong, it helps a lot.<br>  <br>  -PAUL
ugy5wjftaa	wow, that was hard work to read ...  firstly .... be honest with him, if you have no feelings for him, tell him straight .. if you dont want to keep in touch as friends ...tell him ..... if it was me i'd want to know so i could move on.  if you do this right then he wont flirt and he will leave you alone.  You dont have to tell him you are with another guy, but if he asks, then dont lie, if he knows where he stands, he is more likely to get over you faster....hope this helps, good luck xx|`|jI2j3wd8aa	tell him to stop acting so immature, and u don't like him like that.|`|A7lghafHaa	do not respond to his calls or texts at all  if he is an idiot it will take him a while to figure out you are not interested  or  tell him you are not interested    if he continues maybe a big guy friend can go speak with him|`|2vH6VktWaa	Tell him your phone is only for emergencies.

Just how important is it to you to be right?  From what you are telling us, it seems to be excessively important to you.<br>  <br>  Love and honor your mother.  Put these disagreements in a bag and throw them in the river.
qdsVS1dDaa	Steely, just ask her out. If she has a bf, she will say so. Why do you have to have a crush on a gal to take her out? You will learn a lot more about gals if you date a lot of them without getting serious with one.     When she said "I want you, I need you." you should have said "Here I am" right then.  Steely, you have to keep them talking to you.    Also, don't develop serious crushes on gals. If you are interested in one, ask her out. Get to know her. That is what dates are for. That and having fun. Don't ask a gal if she has a bf, ask her out. (And ONLY in person!)    Often, we build up someone in our minds until they are perfect. Then, when you get together you find out that the person is opposite of what you thought. Then you are in a real pickle. Better to take her out and find out what she is like first-hand.

gj6rpPjYaa	Who says you need to go out or engage in any bedroom action on valentine's day! Forget all those things and do what most newly weds fail to do to put their union on a strong footing. Spend the night quietly alone with your wife and discover who she is. Then lay down the right policies that will teach her to be the ideal woman, wife and mother. After valentine night, gently lead her to achieve that goal.  To know who she is:  1. Probe her intellect to discover the type of knowledge she has stored in it.  2. Probe her heart to discover the principles guiding her life.  3. Probe her emotions to discover the things that excites her and the things that depresses her  4. Probe her desires to discover her needs and her wants.  5. Probe her mind to discover her past and the way she had handled past situations, circumstances and emergencies.  Let her talk about herself while you listen patiently.    Next, lay down the right policies by:  1. Teaching her to be kind and hospitable.  2. Teaching her to be gentle.  3. Teaching her to be truthful.  4. Teaching her to be a generous giver.  5. Teaching her to be contented with what she has.    Settle it on valentine's night that the man is the lover; he is the one who says the "I love you" twice a day; while the woman reverences the man and submits to him in ALL things. The "I LOVE YOU" said to the wife at 6.00am. expires at 12 noon.    I am sure you will have a most wonderful Valentine's night.
WwVHWz5saa	Urrrm, I think real love needs to be on both sides and both ways so I can't judge this without hearing FROM HIM how he feels about you, which isn't going to happen. True love is about kindness and freedom, it's not all about doing stuff for each other. It's complicated. If he wouldn't do these things for you then I don't think it's true love. But that's not saying that both people in a couple need to go all out to impress the other. What I mean is, that they should have the same view on this kind of thing, do the same amount of stuff for each other whether it be nothing or everything - aslong as they both feel the same.    Only you know when it's true love. True love is subjective, meaning its about opinion not fact. Which means no-one can know but you.    Good luck.
Eu7IZlF7aa	I have exactly the same problem and at times I hate myself for doing that to my husband who doesn't deserve to be treated in such a way yet at times i think i'm totally right for feeling and acting the way i did.  I hate to tell you but this is a mere sign of immaturity. You need to focus not only on your feelings, your situation and yourself but think of it all as a whole and from a different angle. Dont put yourself IN the situation and feel it, try to look at every instance from afar and outside of it and think of a better way how you can handle, do not be impulsive and aggresive coz that only leads to emotions you wouldnt wanna end up having.

When people that are sexually attracted to one another meet and get together all is gravy. This is the infatuation stage of the relationship where your partner cannot do hardly anything wrong. Then there comes a time where little spats arise and are resolved easily because one of the two wants to see the resolution. If one person does not tremendously do something so hurtful to another i.e. cheat, steal, or totally disrespect them. There is the smooth sailing stage afterwards.     Now there is the point of no return the 7months -2 years stage where you are totally aware of this persons habit and what not. This is like the get real stage where you feel free to say what you mean and mean what you say. However if there has been no proposal or plans to Wed this is the most detrimental or tragic stage. A means to no end as some would call it".     This is where the altimatums start flying and planning is crucial. You have got to tell the BF that you desire committment. If he does not desire marrage move on and dont go full thotal into a relationshio without setting the foundation of emotional and mental committment. The physical will come. Make sure you set yourself up for commitment.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	stick with it if you love him,get help,go out alot.......      if its meant to be it will be...only time will tell|`|fbc51fefdf8f90a690cd87fb91f16194aa	Addressing the two specific issues you mentioned:    You don't see eye to eye on things. If they are not important issues (such as money, careers, children, family, religion), agree to disagree and don't get into arguments about them.    You have been feeling emotional. The stress of fighting no doubt makes that worse. If your boyfriend can't deal with your emotions, you need to make them less of his burden and confide more in your friends.    The problem with being close to someone is that it's very hard to get perspective on what you each need to fix to make the relationship work without seeking outside help. You've already started to do this, which is great. Breaking up immediately may not be necessary if you give each other some space for a while.
4PK0hiWeaa	Forget her.  If you make plans you don't just leave someone hanging without at LEAST telling them.  Even if she did leave that morning a phone call would be nice.  She sounds like a flake, don't get involved with girls like that, they only care about themselves. Plus she said she was gonna go to the mall to get an outfit for church.....sounds like a load of BS to me.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Just stop talking to her. She's not taking you seriously.|`|YyFexhd3aa	?|`|UHip02Gxaa	No offense, but isn't this a little extreme for just sleeping through church?  A lot of people do it - it's hard to get up on Sunday mornings!|`|g2QUNwZzaa	you called her WAY too many times in the span of an hour, and then texted her, and then went to her house? she thinks your a possessive psycho with emotional instability. stop caring so much...girls dont like guys who are overbearing, at least not when u first meet them. sometimes ppl change their mind and dont want to talk to u and have to come up with an excuse, so ignoring is easier........    really, chill out about it...|`|ygimTNzoaa	1, if shes hitting on your pals shes not a good little god girl, she probably has no interest in religion maybe she thought it was just something to do because she might've found you attractive. Never try more then 2 times, you were not wrong for texting. I say knock on the door once then text one time then leave. She'd have more respect for you if you did that much believe me. To much is a huge turn off even if she was supposed to be doing something with you. I never assume, and I don't persist. There will be plenty of times where someone you like doesn't work out, be glad it happened this early before you really had feelings for her. There will be someone else. And hey, if you leave her alone completely, she MIGHT even come back to you and apologize. To much in your face is scary. You just went a little over the top but it's OK, we all do sometimes. By this other stuff you added it seems more like she feels bad for you, she thinks you're a good person but she really has no interest in you at all, so it's hard to make time for you. Don't be the only one trying for it, if she decides she likes you I'm sure she knows well you like her and she will come to you when shes ready. Maybe that's all you can do. For all we know, she could have a huge crush on some other guy and she's thinking about him, never know. You tryed, now let her pick it up from here.|`|1sHBVWuKaa	church=no go      ask for some sexy time in the church maybe other than that no no church      make sure, you make sexy time in confessional. u get rid of sins as u make them. win win situation    hurb good|`|YYLzML9gaa	try seeing a movie or something, maybe she isn't religious. god bless!|`|AA10487501	i am almost sure she does not like u. so!  please find a nice girl|`|wCVnav0Maa	its because you're a needy insane christian you need to chill out you dont invite a girl you like to church you take her to a movie DUH! I wouldnt show up either if i was her you moron.|`|MuflptJVaa	Well no offence but i think she said yes to the Church thing because she didn't want to hurt or offend you.She didn't go because she isnt very religious.Then again to say u r leaving her at gods Mercy is sort of...   So she must of flipped that you were "leaving her at Gods Mercy"wich is a religious sort of thing.So nxt time ur with a girl DONT tell them any sort of religious statements and if you do ask them to church DONT flipp if they dont come.Just try to understand and think about why they hadent arrived.|`|2aa9e3a40a6033729bc3d34d32ce7346aa	You are completely crazy, blind and dumb in all senses. She does no care about you at all. Move on, leave her alone and have some dignity.    Through her actions she is showing you she is no interested. You did nothing wrong, she just do no have interest in you.    Why don't you ask out somebody from your church? Is hard to date people who do no share your faith specially when they do no show the minimum interest on you or going to church.     She goes from man to man and she has a long distance relationship, what kind of girl is she and what kind of "man" are you that still pursue such thing?  How old are you?|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	No it's not your fault:)  People can just be mean sometimes  And she might have still been sick from Saturday   But if she was she should have told you instead of ignoring her  Just keep looking for someone  Btw, if I were the long distance girlfriend I'd be really hurt  So you might wanna break up with the long distance girlfriend  Good luck :)|`|6EztfzkEaa	Man, she's young and you're young.  She likes to have fun on a Saturday night.  You asked her to go to church with you on sunday.  I'm a god fearing man myself, but honestly, if you don't meet the girl in church, don't make that your first stop on the dating timeline.  There are so many things you don't know about her beliefs to be inviting her to church yet.  On top of that, saying "no, i don't wanna go to church" sounds terrible to say to someone who's inviting you to go to church.  It seems a little imposing and threatening to what people normally do; they feel they have to watch themselves around you, and that's not a good feeling.      She said yea and supposedly went to the mall to get something to wear...well, that should let you know that she doesn't go to casual dress fuctions very often, as she should have something in her closet that is presentable.  If she had to go buy something, she was probably thinking her haulter top club shirts and jeans were not appropriate.      I mean, she even asked you if you wanted to go out with her on saturday night.  Granted, you had to work, wouldn't that have told you that she was going to go out?  She's not going to stay in because you gotta work.  She went out and partied hard, came home and crashed.  She didn't wake up cause she was tired from her adventure the night before.      Where YOU messed up was flipping out the next day.  The messages, the 'if you don't want anything to do with me, just tell me'?  That was retarded.  You gotta realize that, though you like this girl, she's not your woman; even if it was messed up, you're not in a position to be whining like that to her - as she's not going to take it the way you think she will.  She may like you, but you're coming across like you are in too deep (like you are not experienced in women).  You need to chill out.  She mentioned that she was not feeling good and that she was throwing up right?  She was probably hung over.    So, what have we learned:  1. No church on first date  2. Don't trip over a no call if she's not your girl (or at least be cool when you talk to her)  3. That kiss was not what you think it was (it least not to her)  4. That "..., I love him" statement means nothing but she thinks you're a nice guy.....and  5. Relax.  You're 20.  You seem to be a smart guy, so don't trip out.|`|js2TUHFdaa	Ew she's the woman who gives other women a bad name. She's irresponsible, and immature. You need someone who appreciates you. NEXT!|`|Bq6ae6nnaa	This girl sounds so complicated! Daaamn!|`|2AAhiwgnaa	Dude, you need to relax. First of all, you really are freaking out over nothing. You and this girl are not going out and therefore she does not owe you anything. It was bad of her to stand you up and keep you waiting and all that. That was selfish of her. However, you need to realize that girls are flaky like that sometimes and you just have to deal with it. It seems also that this girl does not genuinely care about you, otherwise she would have come to church with you, knowing it meant a lot. She looks like she is not really looking for any kind of commitment. You need to set your sights on a better girl.|`|UONwTWIQaa	no, you weren't wrong and you shouldn't feel guilty for anything.. she made plans with you, and rather then being a big girl and calling you to say she wasnt going, she just opted out! life ain't like that and someone should give her a swift kick in the pants! but even that probably wouldnt work.. truthfully, i wouldnt want anything to do with her after this incident.. she seems flaky and unreliable and wont live up to her promises.. you will get hurt more then once, and she'll keep finding a way to win you back, then hurt you all over again! be done with her before you get in too deep!|`|s4NvENpfaa	Leaver he alone, freako. Maybe she was in the shower preparing for church. She gets out of the shower and she sees 45 new messages from you on her answering machine and 56 text messages on her cell. Stop being pathetic and let her breathe.|`|fug6NLOkaa	why did she do this to you??   its because your as mad as a bottle of chips.|`|fFUdRi92aa	hey guy i think she doesnt like so let it go  may be u are a freak as she says it.|`|AA11747160	Oh sweetie!  The best thing to do right now is to leave her alone.  Don't text her or call her.  Sounds like she is a "user".  I have known too many good, no make that GREAT, guys get tangled up in these kinds of relationships.  It just drags them down.  Believe me, there are women out there that really appreciate great guys.      So, stay strong and keep your head up!  The right woman is out there and you will find her!!    Good luck!
r1D9P4Vyaa	From a Mans view! I think you handled the situation very well. He sounds very impatient. One , you are at Work, Two, you did try to help, Three, this was not Fast enough for him. Four, he Hangs up on you??? ...... Girl you did everything right. You just need to look at the big picture here. Now, between You and him, you know where you stand in the pecking order, Him first. Then, this money problem he is having, if he is having trouble keeping his money straight then how responsible is this guy? Does he have any money left to treat you like a woman should be treated? Are you going to hold his hand all through life? You sound to me you have a good head on your shoulders. Just something for you to stand back and look at.

I say let him handle his own finances.  If he has a problem at the bank, then he can go take care of it himself.  It's not your place to jump in there and try to help out.

So each man was told he should stay with one woman.     Since then it has been ingrained in society and culture that people should remain faithful.     On the other side of it, it is pretty darn hurtful to pledge to commit to someone, make promises (marriage) and then go back on them. The same as any with any promise, written or unwritten.     If you want to be a player, it's simple, don't commit in the first place.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	in a relationship? Nothing if you both agree to do it.

If your relationship is bad enough to accomodate cheating then get a better relationship that is worth  keeping and being honest with each other|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you are truly in love then you would not want anybody else, if you want an open relationship then make sure you find someone that thinks the same as you do.

There is no reason to cheat today when there are so many tramps around (men and women) that will have an open affair with you and let you sh*g the opposite sex whilst they do too.

If you are close with your cousin then she will understand, ask her if he's always flirting with other ladies, cause it's really bothering you that he is constantly flirting and making passes at you. Or you can tell your cousin I feel like kicking your husband in the b**** so that he can stop flirting with me.

They will always hate the female that "stole" their male...why I don't know.  Females should learn to work together on scumbags like this but it's possible that will never happen.    I would also take number 1's advice and get him alone...except lose the "f*ing" part and just grab him by the shoulders and kick him in the junk so hard and whisper "If you ever mess with me or I hear that you say things about me again, next time I'll make sure you eat these."  Be scary and hostile and he won't mess with you again.  Hell, he probably won't get up for at least 10-15 minutes.

RluCMVUSaa	My good friend you are correct in your thoughts and I agree that we need to guide our young people better.  But, "who's job is it?" We face this because there are some great parents out there who completely nurture their children in their beliefs and provide appropriate guidance for them and they don't want teachers or third parties screwing up what is being taught (not saying that any one line of logic or parenting or beliefs with that statement).  Then we have the other parents who pay no attention, are completely clueless themselves, don't care or are completely out of touch with what our youth face.    I was raised by a mother who never gave the sex talk and said wait until marriage, did I? Hell no! My mother was a denier, if she didn't have to face it then why should she? But I was smart enough and educated enough to go to planned parenthood and get myself on birth control and use thier services.  I was proactive in my own care and therefore do have the opinion that most teens do know something and are not sweet inocent little mindless beings, but even providing my own physical care didn't protect me from abusive relationships on this I had to learn the hard way.      Teens are affraid of control, so they will not tell their parents if a boyfriend is aggressive, if they are hit, raped, sexually active etc. for the simple fear that their parents will strap them down and eliminate their freedom.  Because of this I feel that communities should provide an avenue of information about services and support that are available - they shouldn't encourage this action or that action but be a hub of information and an exposure of choices available.  Should we encourage a teen who is raised to not believe in abortion to take a morning after pill?  I can't say yes to that, but I see no issue in saying "option A is a morning after pill, option B is an abortion, option C is an adoption, and option D is keeping the child."  What I see is that we try to apply one remedy and one solution (abstinance) to a varied society of people who are inclined to make very different choices and have very different outlooks.  When instead we should provide the information, but not the opinion, teens can ask for that and are generally smart enough to do so.    We should empower our young women to make choices concerning their bodies and relationships.  All women should know what the signs of abuse are, where they can get free confidential abuse support, where to go for birth control, pregnancy and std support, and relationship assistance (friends, boyfriends, parents etc.).      The golden question though is how do you get all these people (the teens from various backgrounds and the organizations with much different agendas) to communicate, share and distribute information?      I wonder how many parents would say if given the choice to A. Put their child in a abstinence based sex ed program or B. Put their child in a choice based sex ed program...|`|hXz9jZnCaa	you make a good point on women needing more guidance but some women instead of watching out they get influenced when schools teach sex ed, they get the idea into their head that's why for most schools its inappropriate and also sometimes women and even men have to rely on instinct to tell if something is good or bad hopeful they make the right decision if not then they suffer for it and they live and learn...|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Why focus on the females?  The overarching problems (multiple glaring issues with educational institutions, parenthood, etc.) apply to both genders.  The whole lot of them need help.  By separating the issues into gender-specific concerns we risk alienating both.    Good luck settling on just what kind of help that is -- that's had the bureaucracies of our day in a tizzy for ages.|`|rPywKtJRaa	Sure I think a lot of teens need help.  But unfortunately not everyone is comfortable with hearing certain info.  And many parents will probably complain on the info given and some parents won't care.  There are many places for women and teens to go to get info or help.  It all starts by communication.  Most of the time all you have to do is ask a doc and they could probably give you info or places to go.  Courtney brings up excellent points.  Beliefs can also hinder certain options and there is no defined people to teach this to children.  So as a parent anytime my kids has a Q about sex or abuse or what ever the case.  I am glad to teach them all the options available and show them how to behave appropriately.  I have certain goals for my kids.  If they do not get knocked up or knock some one else up before 18, go to jail, become addicted to any alcohol or drugs, become a bully then I think I will have done my job as a parent.  I think I also want to encourage my kids to explore there options especially if I haven't given them enough info or am not knowlegable in a certain area.  Ask Questions and don't be afraid to talk to someone like a teacher, doctor, nurse to get all possible views on something.|`|jI2j3wd8aa	yes they definitely do need help.|`|WwVHWz5saa	I think you can only learn and get help through your own experiences. I know now many things I didn't know a few years ago, but even if someone had told me the things I know now, it wouldn't have changed me or affected me in anyway. Teenagers need to live through things to become adults. You can't just skip straight from a child to an adult. Any guidance that people give are from there opinions of a good life anyway, it's subjective. I think the most important things are honesty, trust, openness but other people probably think there is more importance in having fun, money etc.    I'm sort of bad with words, but I hope you understand what i'm saying.|`|AG3dYL84aa	Research, I cannot but 110% agree with you.  We feed our teenagers girls to the wolves.  This unfortunately comes from the religious part of American society who want girls to wait until marriage.  They decide not to educate our young people and hope they don't think about sex things too early.  Unfortunately they fail to realize the impact of images have on our young people and decide to ignore the problem.  They don't' want it taught in schools.  Young girls (and young boys) who need to discuss things then have no place to go.  This just adds to the problems.    I'm not blaming them, that's just the way it is.  But if you look what happened to Sarah Palin's daughter, you can see there are sad consequences to ignore the problem.    If you are very passionate about this, you should try to change things.  There are a million ways to do this.  Good luck.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	a friend?  You could consider turning the tables - telling them he/she said it, and accused you cause he/she was afraid of the consequences.    But - if this is for no reason at all - don`t accept it and do not let them win by moving school.  Bullies need to be dealt with.  You need to talk to a teacher you trust, a coach, the headmaster, or someone in authority at that school. Explain what is going on.    Bullies pick on people they perceive as being weaker than they are, and they will not stop unless they are stopped.    Another tactic would be to get new friends, and surround yourself with these friends - bullies are cowards, and will not do things if there are other people (not on their side) to see what they do.    Trust me, you are a better sort of person than a bully.  Been there, done that.    However, if you think you can pursue your love of acting at a school for it, it is a legit excuse to change schools - but in any case - tell people.  It is not weak or anything, it is the right thing to do.|`|1GNKh8mEaa	Go back and beat the **** out of those bullies... LOL    It all depends on what your gut feeling is... Always go with your gut feeling it is always the better choice|`|r3jfodBUaa	don't move just stand up for yourself i always people making things up about me i just it don't bother me. sometimes it get to me but i don't let it get to me.

DON"T LET PEOPLE GET TO YOU IT ONLY TURN UP WORST WHEN YOU STARTED OUT|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	If i was you, my first attempt to stop this would be to just stand up to them. Yes it is scary but most of the time it works. If thaqts not you and something you would do then i would move schools as by the looks of it this issue is never really going to get sorted and the teachers dont seem to be doing much really!? have they thought of expelling them?     Id move to the school were your friends are so you have some familiare faces and the support of your friends.     Also try not to let your self get in to the same situation again at this new school.     be good, dont do anything you may or may not live to regret =]|`|6jN3g0x8aa	Talk to someone who can help you, to also gain self-esteem in this area.  Bullies usually target those with low self-esteem and/or self-confidence.  This "friend" of yours is not really a friend, or she wouldn't have done such a cruel thing to you.    Change schools if you have to, but only as a last resort.  Try to sort it out where you are.
Xosu35K7aa	i believe your dreams are stuff you think about during the day that gets too you.  maybe him flirting is getting too you?    do you think your bestfriend would do that?  or your boyfriend? if so i think the trust issues the bigger problem.    im not being mean , sorry if it sounded that way! :] x    i hope he isnt though! good luck i hope that helped|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Its probably just your dreams. I doubt there's anything going on, but you can confront your boyfriend about it. Just tell him "hey, i've been having this crazy dream *explain dream* ain't that messed up?" and see how he reacts. If he starts acting really weird then maybe there really is something going on... but honestly I don't think your dream is telling you anything, I think you're just paranoid.|`|OE8r1VtRaa	Actually, a dream of your loved one cheating on you actually menas they are very faithful and are NOT cheatig, i had this problem too. Look up in dream books or online, to dream of your partner cheating is a good omen theywill be faithfull, just like dreaming of death means a new beginning or fresh start , not death :)   Smile!! all is good x|`|wVnVKxTAaa	Dreams are reflections of our subconscious.

Ah39N2ejaa	You did good laughing with them!! If they bring it up tomo just laugh again and say like "that was so embarrassing!" Its better for you to say it first plus it can make u feel like ur not hiding anything & u dont care, at least they cant tease you after that! If u act bothered then it'll give them a reason to keep bringin it up! Dont worry about the blushing, if anyone does say your blushing then say "yeah i know" with a smile, it seems more sweet than embarassing...  I was walking in a public place once by myself and i tripped and slammed into the floor, all my notes fell out my folder, i could feel everyone turning their heads! The worst thing is if i was with a friend i could smile but by myself i couldnt.. that was so embarassing.. i kept going over it in my head but later on i told a friend and we laughed and i felt better! Anyway, dont worry, trust me there are much worse things that could happen than both our stories plus we could be celebrities and it could be front page news where millions would read! Can you imagine that!! So yeah we ALL fart, so dont worry man, imagine if it was someone else in the group, would you see it as a MAJOR thing, probably not, but we always give ourselves a harder time dont we!|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	I once lost a finger by slamming the car door on it|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	When I was about 8, with a bunch of friends, someone did, not me.

I checked and found I had a 400.00 balance, so there was no reason it shouldn't have gone through. I printed off the balance statement, went to the resturaunt again, explained my situation to the manager...he knew me (I'm a regular) and he was understanding, I tried to pay again, and whala! It went through...I just felt very fortunate that I hadn't started eating the food before I paid for it, because then it would have looked like I was trying to bail out from paying...It was a horrible situation that could have become much much worse...thank god it didn't.|`|e64e1a69e99081365cfc77e7c378af2eaa	my partner had her parents coming for a few days all i had to do was make them dinner when they got here,i decided to make a spaghetti bolognese and top it of with cheese well u can imagine the horror when i dropped the cheese in the dirty dish water at the side of me. i quickly ran it under the cold tap and patted it dry then grated it..... served it up anyway no one ever knew the difference ha ha.    i have not even told my other half that story yet .|`|AA10297314	Just for the record I am a female i just don't want my true identity known that is why I chose Billy Bob anyway here is my story.

The part my aunt forgot to tell me is that you should still probably only sleep freely at home or wear some comfortable cotton shorts or pants. I wore a night gown I must have slept wild becuase in the morning my friends mother had a talk with me about the importance of being a classy lady and wearing panties.
c9a470b2327a7dfb6f148bee0f335df7aa	I would start out by talking to them and telling them that I'm not getting anything back from the friendship. Point out that I'm always there for them in times of need and that they should be doing the same for me.  If they continued to act that way, i would really have to consider distancing myself from that person.|`|AA10031957	Confront your friend politely on what you need from the relationship, a relationship based on clear and open communication is healthier.

If he was really in love with you, you wouldn't have to question it.|`|AG3dYL84aa	Angie men are almost the opposite of females when it comes to wanting to spend time time together after work.  After I finish work, sometimes I just don't want to be with anyone.  Have you ever heard of happy hour drinks at bars?  This is for men who don't want to go home and deal with this.  So you have simply find a way to compromise before you get into a fight or you are going to have troubles later on in this relationship.  Just remember that men and women are different.

And there's the difference. You may need to do some growing, but so does he.|`|a8ro1lXKaa	What I think is right is for the guy to pay most of the time, but for you to offer every now and then    You do get people who are selfish though, and you also get people who just don't like to spend too much money, or don't have it to spend.    It's your choice, either accept it, or it's going to bother you and just talk to him about it.

Good luck!|`|ad1b001dc05d77bbec05a443aa74ca50aa	The long tradition of guys paying was because few women worked and most of those that did work, worked because they were single parents.  Today, splitting the costs of a date should be fairly based on incomes.  You do not need to and should not get technical and use your last tax returns to calculate exact ratios, but unless there is a big discrepancy in incomes then you should accept splitting the tickets.  If you are working part-time and going to school while caring for 3 kids by yourself, while he is a single doctor, then yeah, he should pay for everything.    To me, if a woman insisted that I pay and promised to pay for the next date, either she wants it to be favors and thinks that would be fair and romantic or she is just broke right now.  Either way, I would still consider another date with this woman.  If a woman insisted that I pay and did not promise to pay for the next date, that would tell me either that she is doing far worse than me financially, she is greedy and selfish, or she is saying she will have sex with me tonight but it will cost me.  I would ask questions to get her to open up and discuss her financial struggles a little because otherwise I would never want to see this woman again.
FkdEyXudaa	Well I think it's great you guys decided to wait, i'm waiting to so let me tell you now it's real hard for her, especially when in the same bed with the one she loves she's so close but she can't do it. I don't think sleeping in the same bed is a good idea, AT ALL!!! WAAAYYY too much temptation!!! The mind is only so strong. And she's becoming a woman so she will have different feeling about sex at this time, but don't worry , just don't give her the temptation, you have to be strong for her, if you give in she will too.

She may be saying she wants to save her virginity but will have no compunction for losing it if need be, and it will not enter into her religious beliefs, since many Asians see a different line drawn between sex acts and religion due to Buddhist influences, which can bastardize Christianity the way it's taught other places.  Blushing from kissing is nothing, since Orientals aren't big on kissing even after marriage.  It wasn't a part of the culture.  If she seems to want to have sex, it's probably from getting more familiar with you, knowing your intentions are good towards her and marriage and she doesn't really have the need to have the knot tied to have sex.|`|vFCX50DZaa	Go for it and stop wasting time.

He obviously needs to grow up and be independent, but there is not much you can do to facilitate this. Try counseling, but unless he recognizes that things need to change: not much hope.

You have to blame your senseless husband first.  He should take care of you - not your in-laws.  You should make him change his attitude.  Better you drag him away and stay separately.  or as a lost resort you have to take extreme step of divorcing your husband to keep you peace.  But for this you should be economically independent.

The bible says that you leave father and mother and become one. I fully believe that. You also need to stand up to your family because no one can force you to do these things. You come first for your husband over anything else. I understand families have different ways of living but my belief is that the husband needs to take charge here. I wouldnt bash him for it but try to encourage him to take back control. If you have to not return phone calls...not answer the door.

They can only control you if you allow them to, and if you are not earning, in your own mind, you are allowing them to control you.    Do not let them destroy your self respect, faith and belief in yourself.      There is only ONE person in the entire world that you own, and have total control over and that is YOURSELF.      They do not own you.  Do not allow them to control you.  Be polite but firm in everything you say or do, because after all they are still your in-laws.  But TAKE CONTROL of YOURSELF.

Before marriage also you should have known this. If your husband loves and cares about you and your son despite all your feelings of distress - it is worth waiting for your life to settle down. In India - family and wife have parallel priorities and hence there is always a conflict. After professional courses - the feelings you have - increases exponentially - you can consider this: education is for enlightenment of soul and self not a money making tool. If your husband and his family has sufficient financial strength - stop worrying about your being MBA and not allowed to work. If you resolve your feelings and be patient - and in a subtle way - try to communicate your point of view to your husband, he will eventually come to you - with much more love and understanding. Choice is yours - patiently nurturing the relationship or getting nervous, suffer and breakdown. Best of luck.|`|QV5E70e6aa	First of all it was not a wise decision to leave the job.

I think every girl is going through the same thing back in india.     Here people do teach young people to respect elders but nobody teaches elders to respect young ones.    Anyways only option to get rid of these people is - Live in your own world....    I mean find out good job for yourself and get divorce. If you can't then bear to the torture (like me).|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	As far as i know, Indians (as what I perceive of you) have that undying tradition of living with your inlaws and the rest of the husband's family members and you cant help it, thats your practice and i dont think your husband would agree if you'd choose to separate your family from his.     But even then, you have a mind and a life of your own that only you can decide, you should talk to your husband if his inlaws are not treating you well. He will understand and might even try to talk to his parents if he really cares how you feel.  Try being a little more patient with your inlaws as well, ..as we all know most inlaws are naturally not too attached to their sons/daughters-in-law.. Good luck.

ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	At the risk of sounding like I'm defending my gender, I will say there are women who seem to think the same way.  It is probably more common for men to have this attitude than women, however.    Part of it is the attitude and acceptance by the other person in the relationship.  If you tolerate his behaving that way it is an incentive for him to go on with it.  Or if I tolerated it from my wife or other partner it would reinforce their behavior.  Some men learn this from watching the way their parents act.    My mother was the stronger person among my parents.  My father was inclined to just accept things--Mom wanted to change them.  So I tend to be a little more democratic (note the little "D", please) in my relationship with my wife.    In both of my marriages I have tried to treat my women right.  My first wife took full advantage of that.  My second and current wife tends to be a lot more pushy than I would like but other than that she is reasonably fair in our relationship.  I don't demand very much.    Simple question--a very complex answer.  I hope it helps.|`|AA10855383	Hey!!! I asked a similar question to a guy this weekend. He said that men feel that they have to be in control. If a man messes up, he expects you to just forgive him and move on with it, but if you mess up, then suddenly oh my god, its wrong, you are the bad guy, you will not be forgiven and you are out the doors, it over.  Its a double standard.     Men are one-sided like that. Just liek the girl i mentioned.. how her man cheated and cheated on her... but when she LEFT him, he couldn't take it, he ended up KILLING her or leaving him. (then he kileld himself).     It is never okay for a man to do something wrong, and thing he can get away with it. He will not get away with it.

Yes they can... And I am so sorry that you got involved with such a person. Life is all about "lessons" and we never stop learning. Take the good from this, which is your son & move on.

He sounds like an awful person who just really wants to use people. I am so sorry he is the father of your son because your son deserves someone better for a father. Go to court and seek child support so you can get some assistance because he obviously, isn't going to voluntarily give you a penny.|`|k4fd4jnjaa	Unfortunately-Yes. However I will gaurantee he will be misserable. A 36 yr old child, and you know he does not love this woman one bit. Hold on to your son and hopefully you are not in a situation where you are going to have to ask him for child support. Getting involved with any form of the friend of the court will give him rights to that child. Your son does not need to be another "him". This other woman might have things ,but never his heart. He dosen't love himself enough to be a part of his own son's life and that tells you what he thinks of himself. He sounds cold and damaged. He's her problem now! Keep your head up and don't worry eventually the other woman will get tired of always flipping the bill for him and that's when karma comes in to say "you've got legs-beat it". Then his situation will be nuch more devestating then yours is.|`|IF95rI2aaa	Absolutly, he couldnt handle life and what it deals with, so all he wanted was an easy way in life, dont let him bother you or get to you.... what comes around goes around, he wasnt meant for you two to be together.|`|JF0SIngqaa	It sounds like you may be better off without him. He is selfish, self-centered and at his age should be ready to support the child that he wanted. He is taking the easy way out and letting someone support him.The one good thing from all of this is you have your son. I would not allow him to mistreat you ever again. You deserve better and may find that special person some day.Be glad you found out his true character before you married him.|`|aSn5Vz8Gaa	yes people can do this. women have been doing it for years. they are gold diggers. consider yourself lucky he left sooner then later.|`|h4kl18OOaa	Just like there are women in this world that want a rich man to support them; there are men that look for a rich woman to take care of them.    But when she's done with him; she'll toss him out OR he'll find another woman with more money that isn't quite so bored with him to take him in for a diversion.    A lot of women raise their sons to be this way.  As children they see their mom going from man to man all for the money so why shouldn't he go from woman to woman when he's old enough to take care of himself?  Or they live off of welfare.|`|mN9AUoDjaa	Unfortunately there are mean rotten people in life.  I was married to one of them for many years.  Some of these scroungers just want an easy ride and in this life there are givers and takers.  It needs courage to move on and try to meet someone who will appreciate and respect you.  Good luck.  Forget the slimeball, he doesnt deserve a home or a child.|`|yeG5DZRAaa	Some men are clearly out for themselves (and women too). And yes, these people are so shallow and selfish they will jump ship so to speak for the "bigger and better deal". It sucks for lack of a better term. Life is hard and some will look for money as a meal ticket. I know a guy who married a wealthy woman and stated "you can marry into more money than you can make in a lifetime if you look for it". I was blown away by his comment and now see him in a different light. Luckily, he found the money before he ruined someone else's life.     I hope you can find someone who loves you and your son for who you are. I always try to find something positive when something goes bad. For what it's worth, be happy he didn't leave you later in life with a larger family for younger woman. He's the looser and someday he will meet his maker and pay.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	Yes some men are like that.  But don't let that be a shock to you since many women are like that!    Also, I hope you have learned a lesson not to be having children with men who haven't even made the commitment of marriage to you.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Unfortunately Yes, there are people like this in the world, as you've found out. They choose nice people like you, because you are generous and giving.  And he is a taker.  He may have loved you for a while, but as soon as the next shiny new thing comes along, they're off chasing it, thinking only of themselves with no remorse for the hurt they cause others or the chaos leave behind.      Get legal advice regarding custody and child support.  Protect yourself and your child.  You never know when he may be back, using his fatherhood to worm his way back into your lives.  He's way too irresponsible to be a good father.  I'd steer well clear of him if I were you.    I wish you all the best.

Also, if you can, watch a few episodes of Intervention on A&E. You might get some ideas.<br>  <br>  When he crosses the line (smoking in front of the kids) be sure you have a plan of action.

It sucks but whatever happens from here is your fault if you allow it to go  on. <br>  Maybe you used it before having a family, but you have grown up and accepted responsibility an he has not. Will he ever? I would serve him an ultimatum...no agreements that he can leave the house and do it else where or that he can do it before going to bed...it must be the drug or the  family...you both owe it to the family...love your kids, love yourself...period.|`|AA10457351	Sounds like your husband is addicted to pot (yes, it can happen b/c pot is a drug), and I've been down this road before w/my ex-husband. My ex-husband smoked pot when we got married and, at the time, that was cool with me. When my children were born, he progressed to harder drugs and eventually ended up getting arrested on drug charges. I stuck with the marriage for another couple of years, but he couldn't hold a steady job, so I was the bread-winner in the family, paid all the bills, and had to be both mom/dad to my kids. It even got to the point where I had to start treating the ex-husband like a child. I finally had my fill of everything and figured I could do better on my own (which I did). <br>  <br>  Give him an ultimatum about the pot or the marriage. I did that to my ex and, as you can see, he took the drugs. Tell him to get some help or you are going to walk. The kids don't need to be around the pot smoke (even if they are asleep, they are still in the house while it is being smoked). You have to do something b/c, if he is ever busted with the amount you say he purchases each payday, you run the risk of losing your children ... That is the one thing that made my decision to leave my ex-husband so easy b/c his drug abuse was not going to cost me my kids.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	My fiancee is the exact same way. He comes home from work late every day and then after taking a shower leaves to get more. It makes me so sad, I never get to spend time with just him, its always him high. I have tried talking to him about it, but all he says is that I knew this about him when we got together and he thinks im more fun when im stoned, even though he knows I gave it up. I don't know how to change him. he says he will still be smoking when he is forty. all afternoon/night he is either out getting pot or having people over to smoke. its awful. i don't think anything will change him until he is tired of smoking. he complains about never having enough money, yet he spends almost 1000 a week on pot. its absolutely ridiculous. i hope your husband comes to his senses soon. he should be more concerned with your feelings. also, he could get in serious trouble if he gets caught, and that could really jeopardize your family, finances, and marriage|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Honey, you need to RUN home with your children to your mother and leave him. He is a DRUG ADDICT and putting you at risk for losing your kids, if the law finds out. <br>  <br>  Don't waste your time asking him to stop. He isn't. Get out while the gettin' is good. You have plenty of opportunity to do it while he's stoned - use it wisely!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LvTIVjySaa	Call the police and have him arrested.  What he's doing is illegal and your children should not be given the message that it's okay for him to do it.  Tell him this stops and stops now, or you will call the police each and every time he sparks up.  He definitely cannot do this around the house.  He risks exposing his kids to police raids and the unsavory element that seems to exist in the drug world.  He's high 10x a day, then he's doing this around your children, exposing the kids to danger.  Financially, he has no right to indulge in this vice when the money spent is a hardship on the family.  You need to get his a$$ out of your home, and he needs to be dealing with the law.  The fighting needs to stop.  He needs to be shown the door and you need to provide a safe and happy home for your children and yourself.  I just don't see why this charmer is such a priority, because he certainly is willing to put himself before his wife and kids.  Get rid of him.|`|Bd47h6Ovaa	Intervention|`|MlHPTLkUaa	Hi, I suggest that you wait until he is NOT high, like a drunk person, there is no point in trying to reason with a person in that state, it only leads to arguments.<br>  <br>  When he is 'normal' explain camly and clearly what your concerns are, both for himself, and you and the children.<br>  If you think it may help then try an intervention type discussion where loving and caring people are available and willing to speak up and lay it on the line with him, (I don't mean get a gang to lamb-baste him with just your opinion).<br>  It will depend upon his personality and also on how you you would like to proceed with it, as to which method to pursue.<br>  <br>  He Must be made aware of how it is affecting both yourself and the children, the stresses it is causing and state clearly that if it continues there is only one possible outcome.<br>  <br>  It is important that you also listen to his side of the story, there may be reasons he has not told you previously that may account for his behaviour.<br>  <br>  If things get difficult and he insists on ignoring you or threatening violence, then break off the discussion, say nothing more one way or the other.<br>  <br>  Then at your own leisure, contact a group that can give you genuine advice about what your options are, also contact social services and discreetly enquire what your standing would be in the case of you having to have a restraining/barring order placed against him.<br>  <br>  Then again on a day he is 'normal' camly express your love and try to get across that you are acting out of love for him and trying to get him to realise what he is doing to the family.<br>  <br>  Tell him that you are no longer willing or able to put up with the situation and let him know that you WILL either have him removed from the family and home or that you will take the children and leave and that he will have to seek help with his problem before you will consider placing yourself and the children in his company as it is such a dangerous and untenable position to put a family in.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he will ponder upon what you have said and realise that he is placing too much strain upon your relationship and that he is endangering his children through his actions (as there is every chance that the addiction will grow to harder drugs,)<br>  <br>  If he has any sense of responsibility and a love for his children and you left, he will then do what is right.<br>  <br>  It reqiuires that you be there for him through it (Imagine yourself in his position and wanting to quit and get clean, you would need the help and support of your partner too.) it is NOT something to be taken on lightly, it really requires the help of professionals who know the dangers and pitfalls of getting clean.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out favourably.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	You met this guy when he was still actually a baby in my book. He was only 16.  Two years later he is married with kids.  This is probably what drove him to pot.  Children should be children first and leave grown up stuff to older folks.  You both should have enjoyed your youth in a carefree way.  I think he is immature and was not ready for this.  Have a good talk with him, see if this is the problem and try to engage a good friend or family member to help you guys out.|`|O1b7das7aa	$240 a month x 8 months = $1,920.00<br>  <br>  No it is not normal. Was he a pot smoker before you married him? If so, why are surprised at his behavior. What's that expression...a leopard doesn't change its spots?<br>  <br>  What he's doing is illegal. Do an intervention. Invite his parents and your parents and a REAL adult that he respects and invite them over when he's blazing it up. Have these people tell him that he's wasting money on weed when he should be saving it for a house (I am guessing you guys rent), retirement, kids college, savings in case of a layoff, anything but weed.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	I finally left, actually fled, with my three little boys in a very similar situation. To this day I'd say it was one of the smartest things I've ever done.<br>  I very very very strongly advise you to do the same and never look back. If you stay then you're someday soon going to find him offering a toke to one or both of your kids. Maybe worse. Second hand smoke also affects those who are sleeping. Had you thought of that? <br>  You don't want to stay long enough to know what happens next in these situations. If it sounds like I'm trying to scare you that's because I am scared for you and your babies.<br>  Please find a way to get away from this guy...heartache and misery are in your future if you stay.
hjr9uv1Iaa	He probably has been hurt b4 and can see himself falling in love with you and is scared of being hurt cuz what hes doing sounds alot like what i did when my ex left me but yea just call him and be straight forward with him tell him how you feel dont be to upfront just the basics on how you feel you dont wanna scare him off lol but yea he'll come around just give it time
cn1jWO4Haa	u dont need one.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	why the hell would anyone be able to answer that question for you.|`|TJEzMl00aa	thats sumpthing you need to figur out on your oun but it duss sound like your desrit and girls dount like desprit
h4kl18OOaa	Child support is not about visitation.  It's not for you either; it's for your child....his clothing, medical expenses, school expenses, day care expenses, hair cuts, food, place to live, etc.      Your ex is using this as a way to make you feel guilty for taking him to court to get what he should be glad to pay for your child.  He's not a very responsible mature person if he's making petty threats to you to make you feel guilty.    It doesn't matter whether he comes to visit your child or not, your son still has to eat and be clothed and have a place to sleep and a place to live.  Grow up in your thinking.  It's not about you.    If he doesn't want to see your son that's ok.  The child is 2 years old; it's not like he's going to be asking where the non-existent dad is.  You just need to go on with raising your child as well as possible.  Get your education and better yourself for your son.  Your son will appreciate all that you did to make his life better.  He'll see for himself that there never was a 'sperm donor' father around to help him.      Don't waste time begging him to visit your son.  It's his loss.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	MAKE HIM PAY! He is being stupid and he obviously shouldnt of had kids in the first place. He is just trying to upset you. dont let him get to you.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He has a legal obligation to support his child financially.  Child support is not "payment" for being involved in a child's life.  If he chooses not to have a relationship with his own child that's his choice, but he still has to pay support.  It's the law.|`|AA11603810	Regardless of what he says, file. It is his responsibility to help support his child. If he chooses not to see his kid, then so be it. That is his decision. It sounds like that would be someone I'd rather not have my kid around anyway.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You raise your son and use the support money for the things he needs.  Do not bad mouth his father to him.  And if the father eventually wants contact, let him have it.  Get over it all ready.  The man is just using your guilt to try to avoid his responsibilities.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	F*** him make him pay he's only using it so he can turn it all around on you. He already decided not to be in your childs life and when your son gets older he will be smart enough to know how 'great' his dad really was.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You would be a fool to do so.    You can't make a man "be" a dad.  Use the child support to raise a good decent human being, and stop trying to change what you can't.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	he wasn't seeing him before but now he's using your son as a weapon against you to get out of paying child support?    He's manipulating you to shirk his responsibilites.  Keep moving forward with the court preceedings.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Tell him he has the responsibility to     a) pay for his offspring    b) see his offspring.    Sorry to say you sure bedded an immature jerk. Do your son a favour and teach him not to be like his father.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	It sounds like emotional blackmail.  If he only wants to see his son if he doesn't have to pay support, he really doesn't care about his son at all.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Isn't it wonderful how childish the games adults play concerning their own children??  Total nonsense.....  If he isn't smart enough to see his child, f*ck him... you and your child need the support.  Don't let him blackmail you regarding child support versus seeing his son...  What a loser he is.|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	screw that! your son is his responsibility too! He has to help support him! If he wants to be an azz and not see him because he has to help support him, that is his loss! You should not feel bad at all! He is the one making a horrible decision!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	he's immature and needs to pay. it's for your son and to help all. if he wants to boo hoo and all, let him|`|TfijWwsYaa	Tell him so be it.  Make him pay and enforce it 100%.  My son's dad was like this sorta...never saw his son but I enforced child support mainly because he didn't see him at all.  He went to jail because he wasn't paying.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	You can't sign away your child's rights|`|Gb19X3xVaa	Make him pay.|`|y07MGbLcaa	make him pay, slash his tires, egg his house, and rob him for everything you can, and tell him that the kid doesnt love him|`|UONwTWIQaa	if you have primary custody, he needs to pay whether he see's your son or not!!!  and think about it, really, its his loss and his own stupidity if he chooses not to be in the childs life... but you are entitled to the support snce he had a hand in making that child and he should pay his support.. do your self a favor, if he chooses not to have visitation, get full custody rights, so he cant hold you back in any way!!! good luck! what a jerk!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Why is it your fault he is an ***? Unfortunately you can't make him a good dad, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't still financially support his child. If he didn't want to be a dad, there are ways he could prevent it from happening. Either keep it in his pants, or wear a condom.|`|kEKcJ5zcaa	Honestly if he left you and is needed to pay this dont stop, because how do you know that he just isnt saying thins just to not pay and then ditch on you. But i havnt had much expirence in this subject but id say keep the money flowing he left you and now he should be helping you.|`|dRnR1Uimaa	No u should let him pay, its his job as a father to support his son, dont get scared by his threats, if he doesnt come around to see his son, let him know that his son will grow up to recent him and it will hunt him forever, he is not doing u a favour by coming to c his own son. So cancelling child support is not even an option.|`|yy45iAbtaa	what is wrong with you.that is not your money that is your sons money for cloths shoes food a roof over his head a warm place to live in the winter no you should not cancel it.the dad just don't want to pay child support so he is threatening you.if you cancel the child support your a fool.if he does not want to be in his sons life that is his problem you will find someone who does want to be in your life and your sons life.it is not your money it is your sons and he needs it.|`|9c8ea4cf035f809b42cd1b21b58e7533aa	It's his responsibility to to pay for and see his child. You can put him on child support and make him pay but you cannot make him see him. So since he wasn't around much to begin with I say leave him on child support.|`|6oM9kfK2aa	its not easy being a busy mom, u should not feel bad for needing help. if this guy does not want to be in your sons life because he has to pay child support then he didn't care in the first place. you did not have him by yourself !   im young and my dad pays..like your sons father he does not want to have anything to do with me because he pays. your son will feel unwanted  for while but at least me can be taken care of in some kinda of way. honey please don't feel bad for wanting your son to be taken care of . if his dad wanted to be there he would be and he would want to help his son. he is just trying to stop you from making him pay...    i hope i have helped you, just remember the there is nothing wrong with doing what you have to do to take care of your family|`|MvAyYyv3aa	No keep him paying, its for your son and really has nothing to do with want is goning on between you and him.

JiATH6rGaa	Haha!     What do you mean by a gay email address? That term is used quite loosely...     Do you mean homosexual? Or are you using 'gay' as a negative adjective?     Any word you like and add guy4guy or girl4girl after if you mean homosexual. :P     Or just put random words together that make no sense if you mean just a 'bad' screename.

Particularly women who are very maternal and want to have a family.    Others, like myself, are wary of marriage. I believe that even in this day and age, marriage is not equal and women get the raw deal - and statistics show that while men thrive health- and happiness-wise in marriage, women are much healthier and happier (and less stressed) when single. I've been in a relationship for 6 years and I have no interest whatsoever in getting married. In fact, the idea freaks me out so much, I won't even discuss it with my partner!

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	even if u call matty and get her to stop calling him, there will always be another to take her place unfortunately. any man who is confronted with the truth, and doesn't show remorse, and is on the defense, is cheating and has no intention of stopping it. the right response should have been a show of remorse, a willingness to seek some therapy, but he's getting angry with the victim here. he is disrespecting u, not the other way around. yes he is cheating on u, and its up to u what u will do about it. but why let a man do this to u? and there isn't anything u can do to stop him, u can only control yourself.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I'd call her and b**** her out! Your husband is doing wrong! He's getting angry at you because he's mad that he got caught and he's trying to cover it up. Don't let him treat you like this! You deserve better! I'd confront him again and tell him to tell you the truth! Don't be naive and let him walk all over you.|`|Amkmles0aa	why will a men do that for|`|4HoVVCenaa	Don't call her, it is not her fault. It is his. Tell him to stop or you are gone... and mean it. He is way wrong. P.S., he is probably not cheating but this is still bad behavior. Don't put up with it.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Call Cheaters and have them follow him and video tape him or get a private investigator yourself.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Of course you need to call her and tell her to get lost.    He is talking to a 17 year old because it makes him feel like he must be something special to get the attention of a 17 year old    In the state of Virgina he could get in trouble depending on what he is talking to her about.|`|qusKbEmBaa	no give him space and if it keeps happening mention the situation to him and how you feel and ask him if its true. hope i helped  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best answer. thanks)|`|zTiaGyuMaa	I am sorry but he shouldn't be talking to a 17 year old to begin with. He may or might be cheating. The only to find out is through him or her. I would be pissed off to. You have a right to be questioning him about this. It is spacious he should understand that. I would be on him about this. Just remeber you are his wife he should explain why he is talking to a 17 year old.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	First off if you suspect he is cheating 99% of the time he is cheating  Secondly your husband is Cheating based on the evidence you found.  Thirdly I think he is behaving like adisgusting pig - He is practicallya pediophile.  No 35 year old man should be buying things for and/or texting a 17 yr old girl.  I cannot believe your only issue is that it is "disrespectful" to you.  What he is doing has long lasting harmful implications to the girl.  I wouldn't call her she is still a child and you are an adult woman and it is your pig of an adult hsband who is messing around with a child.  I would try to find out her last name ( I would DEMAND it from the cheating husband - or he is out the door, no excuses ) and contact her parents.  Let them get to the bottom of what is going on with thier daughter ( she likely needs some help ).  I would demand full disclosure from hubby, who is this "friend" they have in common with this young girl?  Get his contact info, and get the girls parents contact info, again if he balks at giving you this info then you know without a doubt he is cheating and you need to kick him out pronto.  Go through your credit card and bank statements.  Highlight anything fishy.  Call a lawyer and start hiding money - give it to your mom, sister, or best friend to hold I wouldn't trust him right now, when a man knows he is caught he often grabs up the money expecting to get tossed out.  Besides why is he spending money that should be for the both of you on this little girl?|`|F4d89iRMaa	your husband may not be cheating but is obviously hiding something. if you never found out he would never have told you--not by a long shot anyway. don't take his bull-ish on him saying that was disrespectful of you because he is the one being disrespectful so he GOT NO ROOM TO TALK OR NO SAY IN IT. Don't call the girl bc it isn't her fault, its your husband's. Now, if it continues then you have the right to know whats going on and do what you have to do to what you need to know. Good Luck.|`|988545e5cde987b90322ced29ffdd6b0aa	I am going through the same thing.  I found out my husband was cheating when our son was 2 weeks old.

I am now getting a divorce and have a 12 week old son to care for.  AFter 9 years, he does this.  But call, it wouldn't hurt to call and talk to Matty.  Find out the truth.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	NO, he is just trying to help America's youth.|`|wiv8Ctmaaa	Ouch! You love him, right? It may be a cousin! It may be a previous relation malfunction! It could happen, he was 18 if she is 17. Call.|`|AtXoQlY3aa	Wooooohhhhhhh! He could possibly be cheating on you with a 17 year old girl??     Sweetie, you need to get your ducks in a row and find out what is going on by (almost) any means possible. He has the possibility of facing some criminal charges for goodness sakes, not to mention an impressionalbe 17 year old girl who does not understand Sh*t from shinola is being taken advantage of!     It is difficult right now, but use the logical side of your brain as apposed to the emotion side.|`|IF95rI2aaa	I would, i would find out what is going on.. it could be nothing or it could lead to something more. I would confront them both... i wouldnt put up with that, also, if he was defensive when you asked.. there is something going on!|`|wkNvFMLGaa	Ok, deep breaths before you freak out even more then you already are. I know how you are feeling. heart pumping in your chest like it's gonna fly out of there in a min,confused about what the hell is going on.   Now, i had this problem but i am not married so tell you the truth, i would possibly confront the girl about it. although, if she is involved with him and KNEW about the fact he is married, she will cover him up. talk to him about it one more time, say that this is a big deal for you and you can't just let go. what would he be saying if you are texting a 25 year old toy boy calling him honey or whatever?? surely he wouldn't like it. do what your heart is telling you to do, be strong!  good luck|`|8zV90Lpoaa	Ha, what? I highly doubt it's just a random girl. He would not and should not feel comfortable calling a 17 year old "princess". I would really call her. I know he said it wasn't your business, but this has creep written all over it. You need to figure this out with his permission or not.|`|172098d5d415f589483bf057e57cf47eaa	CALL HER IF SHES ONLY 17 SHE CANT LIE THAT WELL YET,  SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HUBBY WANTS HER.

I would call her, pretend to be a friend of your husbands and find out whats going on.  Its not her fault though - it's his.|`|IcH5gMICaa	Uh, what you need to do is destroy his phone, throw all his clothes out the window, key his car, and kick him in the junk.  Disrespectful a-hole is what he is and he deserves all that.  He really thinks some 17 year old is going to nail him?  And he's going to risk is already failing marriage because of that?  HE is not worth your time, sweetie.    Who cares about the Matty girl -she's young and just in it for the "perks" like free minutes.  Found her some older guy (practically could be her father so that is SICK) who's been lying to her and technically your hubby COULD go to prison if someone finds him out -I don't care if he's never touched her.  He doesn't know her or know her character and she could be a little $hit for all he knows.      I'd call the police and tell them your husband is harrassing a 17 year old lol.  I'd throw his *** to the wolves in some type of way and NEVER take him back.|`|iTtxlvZcaa	mayb u should in order 2 get a straight answer|`|AA11871047	sounds a really suspicious situation.. well does look like ur husband is chetin on u but u dont have definte proof... dont raise this  matter for a few days.. see how his behaviur is with u... umm if he is stll defensive and and angry on u then u need to find more abt this matty person..... and wen u have definite proof against him.. confront him and well u will eed to do something abt ur relationship then|`|UONwTWIQaa	when i found the phone   of the chick i thought my husband was cheating with, i called her... i asked her what was up, she told me she had no idea about me... i made it clear i wasn't mad at her since she truly didn't know he was married, and she gave me the truth! and, i divorced him.. bottom line is, no man of that age should have anything to do with another woman, let alone, one who is under age... my man has women "friends" but they barely chat through facebook.. there are no bullsh!t txts or phone calls.. that is deceitful and disrespectful! this is your huge red flag.. dont miss it!|`|zAoKd2DBaa	yes, call her - some people say it's not her fault, but hey that really depends doesn't it, on whether she knows he is married or not?    Whichever way you look at it your husband has done wrong. He is flirting with someone, someone secret from you, who is half his age. She is possibly naive and enjoying the attention of an older man.  More to the point why is she under the name "Matty" - so you don't suspect if "matty" calls?     Call the girl. Tell her you are his wife ! Tell her you will not accept this behaviour going on with your husband.    Alternatively, text her, pretend to be someone else, an admirer maybe, call her princess. Get as much info as possible. Arrange to meet her even.  Better still - change her number in his phone to your own so every time your husband texts "matty" it comes to you really, then you'll really know what's going on !     If he hasn't cheated on you yet he probably is about to.     Alternatively go do some flirting of your own see how your precious husband likes it !|`|k6D1HmtRaa	Definitely he is cheating u.It's no use calling that gal .. as she might be doing just 4 money  and ur husband 4 enjoyment . Try to find out secretly about the matter and when u r sure about then talk to ur husband why was he doing that?|`|AA11089526	No I would not call her...that makes you look stupid and desperate|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi VC   OH you are in a bad bad place right now and i can tell you are upset. I know i would be also and i would wonder what was up with that. You can two thins to see what hes up to. Make a plan to go away without him to your sisters or mothers or anywhere. But don't really go away just pack and stuff but set him up by hiding or renting a car that he don't know. Stake out your house or apartment and see where it go's follow him and trap him. I am sure the Little Princess is more then what he is telling you she is. At 35 guys tend to long for what they once had and if a 17 year old been hitting on him i am sure he is more then happy to fulfill her dreams.   Good Luck|`|tCI8ksvdaa	Why call her?  Do you want even more drama in your life or do you want a real life?  If you want a real life then divorce his cheating rear and get about finding a man who really loves you, is honest with you, is faithful to you, and who really cares about you.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Yes, I would call her.  Your husband wont give you a straight honest answer, so ask her whats going on.  She may not even know he is a married man.  But dont scream at her, or get nasty with her, she may or may not be innocent, but its your husband you should get angry with if he has a cheating heart.|`|dDasUgW8aa	I would find out from her what's going on.  Why is a 35 year old man texting a 17 year old girl?   If he's sleeping with her- contact her parents- I'm sure they'd be glad to hear that some 35 year old man is having relations with their princess.  Um- statuatory rape much?|`|MxHRjPFHaa	Yes call her and jusyt ask her whats going on...And that you are married to him ....Then follow him but  dont let him see you at all.....I really dont know if he's cheating or just like talking to a younger gal........................|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	Yes, yes, yes... That's the only way to find out if your husband was telling the truth cause he sure as hell didn't sound like he did.    And he got angry when asked? -- a very common defense for guilty people! There's definitely something going on with him and you better find out.|`|K7khsWSTaa	He's cheating on you, but you probably deserve it. Relax and let him go, he'll come back when he's finished.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	Call her and get her story.  I've gone through similar instances.    If it seems like he's trying to find a way to cheat with this girl, stop it before it gets too far.    My husband would get mad at me when I would ask about certain numbers on his work cell phone.  He would call and text from his work phone, so I wouldn't know he was contacting this girl.  Red flags went up when he would get the call around me and his response was "I don't know who that is, so I'm not going to answer it."  It's a call on your work phone, why wouldn't you answer it?  That's why you have it.    Follow your "Women's Intuition".  That's why you have it.|`|QTMzjMUYaa	You have nothing to lose by calling her. Your husband is the one being disrespectful and you deserve an honest answer.|`|oMHUyMndaa	Call her pappa, tell him everything you've told us and have him come to your house and pound your hubby

It isn't about being gay, but about a relationship founded on lies. And abusers get worse. You have no real choice but to leave... other wise you will be miserable and still leave in a few years. Better some short term pain and a chance at future happiness.|`|trQ4vqx4aa	You also have the option of leaving.|`|AA11603468	You actually don't HAVE to stay in the marriage for any reason at all. Any one of those 3 things would send me packing. I don't believe in staying married no matter what, though.  I would not be married to a cross dresser, a gay man or an abuser, much less all three. He's a nightmare.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	Kick him out or leave yourself, but since you've stuck with him this long does it really matter.  Your just as messed as him for staying in the first place.    Gays are one thing, bi is another. I love women with a Passion and it just disgusts me that a man can be with a man then go to a women.    It's these men that spread aids to the heterosexual group in the first place, had they just stayed with other men it would just be them dying off.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	no you are not wrong you are 100% right|`|t81MEJ82aa	If this is what he enjoys doing what would be the point in getting "help"? It's time to realize that this marriage is over and start the process of moving on. He's gay, he's a crossdresser, he wants to keep doing it and there's nothing you can do about that. Your love cannot change a person.|`|lhMpqDS3aa	Well, if he's gay and a cross-dresser, don't you think he might wanna be with someone else? Your not wrong to leave if you want to find something better. I'm pretty sure you want someone just for you who is attracted and in love to you, not someone like that. :[ It's not fair to you.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Emotions aside, this situation is transparent. Since you've discovered your husband is "gay" I assume he is not involved with you, his wife, sexually. He is also violent and abusive when you suggest to him to get some professional help. He is distant and secretive. You may get along well but this seems to be more about him living a lie with plenty of comforts. He then is free to be himself and engage in sexual relations with men. You really have no other recourse than to leave him. He is in need of some help but you cannot rescue him from his life. Only he has that power and clearly he is not ready or willing. You will only prolong your anguish and torment if you stay with him. Best of luck.|`|VERrlErvaa	If he has hit you... Leave him.  End of story.  Why would you even consider staying with someone that physically abuses you?    As for him being gay and a cross-dresser... Luv, he ain't going to change.  Either kick his mincy *** out the door; or pack your bags and look forward to an adventurous, abuse free future.|`|AA11080047	your husband is a coward for two reasons one he hit you second he is gay and basically wont be open about it. for what reason he wont admit he gay it might up set he parents that he gay what you have got to realise he will never be a husband he the Sense of the word and never love you like wife either so am afraid you should call time on this farcical marriage as he is only using you.|`|JLjCqKZCaa	You asked him to get help? Help for what - for being gay? You can't 'fix" being gay. He's always going to be gay.    Pack your bags, and let him live his life. He's in denial, there's no sense in you being there with him.|`|UvYzQv5Saa	Short and simple... No you are not wrong for wanting the split. As for whether he should leave or you, that is unknown as i don't know your specific situation. Although it is generally easier for you to leave, than to get someone else to leave.    You say you found out about the crossdressing and then that he is gay. My concern here is do you think he is gay because of the crossdressing or is he both. Because being a crossdresser doesn't mean he's gay nor does being gay mean you are a crossdresser. The two are exclusive of one another.     The fact that you have asked him to get help: what for? Help for his crossdressing? Help because he's gay? Or Help for the marriage?  A crossdresser may need therapeutic help, not to be "cured" but to cope and understand. And I would suggest the same thing for someone who is gay and is coming to terms with accepting it.    However i do agree that he needs help at least with anger management AND the realization of who he is, because he sounds scared and confused. But there is no excuse for the violence.    I wonder how it is that you are talking to him about it? Are you berating him for this? Cause if yes, i would get angry too. (still wouldn't get violent though).     But if you can't cope (you say he needs help) and with the violence. then i would agree that you need to go, or you both need to do some counseling.    k|`|r5VCFLBxaa	Get gender altering surgery.|`|1fd011c04b7013be44a3fd5dc118bf7baa	his hitting you is no good  cross dressing does not mean that he's gay , most cross dressers are straight men . and as to his being gay if cross dressing is why you think that , you need to dicuss it ith him .   dealing with these issues is something you wl need to do together , and maybe he's bi|`|IF95rI2aaa	Sounds like its time to move on, i know i could not deal with something like that! and to top it of HE HITS YOU... either your not very smart or your desperate.

I only ask because most cross dressers are straight.    It's irrelevant though, if he is violent towards you then you should leave him no matter his orientation.    Even if he weren't violent, he clearly isn't interested in making the marriage work if he refuses to seek counselling or even talk to you about these issues.|`|h4kl18OOaa	He should never hit you.  Report him and take your things and leave.  If you own a house or any property, see a lawyer to get your half.  You have grounds for a divorce and if you feel that he married you only to cover his "secret", you could even have the marriage declared void.      You need to see a psychologist to get help in dealing with his cross-dressing and hitting you and in moving forward in your life.  You need to see a lawyer to find out what your options are in getting him to move out or you moving out and ending this relationship.    Never let a spouse hit you.|`|AA11089526	He is ashamed and knows its wrong being gay, cheating and hitting you.  That is why he doesn't want to talk about it...and he wont leave cuz he has no where to go...he has his cake and eat it tooo...his men an you....Just get the hell out of that situation....stop wasting time on him.  You are way to precious to deal with such crap.  And yes, being gay is a sickness.....also it is an abomination to GOD!    He did not make man to lay with man, or woman to lay with woman.....it is gross and sick....just because the public has made such an issue about "coming out" doesn't make it right....just like everything else in this country...so our our morals...going in the toilet.....|`|tCI8ksvdaa	You need to leave him.

k6mYgCBXaa	I feel for you! Sounds like a very confusing situation.    Here is one way to tell if your ex still has feelings for you and it is foolproof to indicicating if you have a chance with them or not. Is she angry with you? If so, that is a good thing. You see hate is not the opposite of love, indifference is. Indifference means we really don't care one way or another. If she is acting indifferent towards you chances are she is being honest and her feelings have changed, but if she is angry with you or you two get into heated conversations or arguments, as crazy as it sounds, you still have a chance. She still loves you if that is the case, she is just mad at you for some reason.    If she is not indifferent, you should give her some space. Don't crowd her. And don't return her phone calls or emails or texts messages for a few days, up to a week later. I know, I know, it's hard but you MUST give her the impression you are doing fine and are ok with the breakup. Give her time to MISS you, really, really miss you! It is the only way to restore your value in her eyes.    There are several psychological factors involved here.    1. Humans have a tendency to take things for granted  2. Humans will fight ten times harder to save from losing somethingthan to gain something.  3. Humans tend to want what they cant have.  4. Humans tend to want even morewhat is JUST out of their grasp.    Be her friend. But don't be too available or friendly. Act like you are JUST fine with this. This is the first step.       Trust me, it works like a charm. I did this to my ex when he broke up with me. Even though I was crushed I refused to show it. I would not return his calls for days and he suddenly started wondering what the heck I was up too! : ) lol...    During the time, I admit I pulled out all the tactics and I am a relationship coach, so I have quite a few! : )     You want to shake them up a bit...don't beg, don't call, don't text...they EXPECT that...give em something they don't expect and soon they will be eating out of your hand.    I know it seems gamey, but hey, I was in love and didn't want to lose my BF forever.    I found some great information at the site listed below too...    Hope it helps! :)|`|sGP6s7uraa	Usually feelings gradually disappear.  One thing, like a fight, can trigger all the negative feelings for you and confirm their unhappiness of being in a relationship.  Give her space and give her time.  Be a friend for her but don't smother her.  She may realize that you are the one for her but you may realize that she is not the one for you.  It just takes time.  Don't push, rush or smother her, ok?    EDIT - We are a bit nuts at times.  It's just in our nature.    The depo shot has NOTHING to do with this.  Don't blame it on the bc.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	Unfortunately, people change.  And with that, feelings change as well.  If her feelings for you are gone, there's nothing you can do or say that is going to make those feelings come back.  They slowly erode over time and once they're gone, they're gone.  I know that's not what you want to hear but that's the harsh reality.  I've been in your shoes twice before and the outcome was the same both times.  My advice is to hang out with friends as much as possible and do things to keep your mind off of it.  You'll get over here eventually.  Time heals all wounds.|`|wKXvAAdFaa	unless her feelings for u were gone before the fight. if u really think she still likes u, then u should go after her. it will be like a romance movie ha|`|91euqhraaa	dude the same thing happened to me in college    here is the reason.....always remember this...    all women are crazy......it is as simple as that....so try and not take it too hard and just move on with your life and look for someone else    but never forget what I just told you....it will make your life 100 times easier...|`|KEqMlOhraa	tell her how you feel before its to late, if you dont tell her now and she does move back she will move on and you will never forgive yourself. tell her something like, " i love you, you are perfect for me and everything i ever wanted. i dont want anything else but you, your everything to me" just make her see that you do really still care about her.
sc6VBAmzaa	Okay some girls I know love the bad type of guys that treat them with an ill manner. Personally I never dated in high school to avoid these type of guys and I held out until I found my first bf. He is wonderful, loving and caring. I would never want anyone else but him. He treats me well and we  have a wonderful connection. Dont worry, not all girls want that bad type of guy, they might just think thats all they can get because they have self esteem issues.

I would say 9 times out of 10 you're picking the wrong girl based on her looks and so you deserve what you get if shes a *****! I bet you don't look at a dorky girl twice lol.    maybe also its instinct for girls to like chasing guys, hence, if the guy is a jerk, girls are interested. my brothers theory.    btw im 20 f uk and i think our generation sucks but one day i'll find that guy.

You could both start with a nice meal and wine, kissing, fooling around, touching, all fairly non sexual, talking, before sexual touching, inclusive of more than just your clitoris and finally, sex!      Sex should be anything but boring, it's fun.  If not, you're not doing it right.  Don't forget, you too can have fun with him, licking, eating off him, nibbling bits of him (gently) - it's all good.    If you both get involved, it's great.

There is nothing wrong with u beleive me but how does ur partner feel about this. just think about that. will ur relationship survive?     Good Luck Hun. x|`|oxmkllnWaa	have you ever had an orgasm? (doesn't matter how) if not get a vibrator and learn how...     let him pick out some erotic movies... and try the moves in the movies he's picked out... or watch some yourself and pick out what you like...    or admit you've tricked him into marrying him, get a divorce, pay all of the expenses, and let him get on with his life with a  normal sexual woman.|`|e77934a3cbc807e2b46e663bb8b721beaa	You think sex is boring.... Are you mad?|`|atNbl4ataa	............this is shocking....um.....talk to your docter i guess....or you could stay as you are and buy your husband some lotion, either way....|`|AA10377490	This is normal to some relationships. nothing is wrong with you.. nothing is wrong with him. It's just hwo you look at it. Some people just dnot like sex, and that's how you are|`|tydulqH3aa	Buy a sex toy. or see your doctor.  unless you dont care if your hubby has a girl frrend it will soon be over.|`|g9iz0yyqaa	Nothing is wrong with you. He should be using foreplay and I guess he's not doing it the right way to get you aroused. A quickie idea. Try masturbating in front of each other and you'll see what turns each other on.

Funny thing about guys is that some are really, really fussy about wearing jewellery. Won't wear any at all, ever. But that's easy enough to find out, and if they're not against wearing jewellery then a ring is a lovely gift, especially for Valentine's Day.|`|AG3dYL84aa	Do you want the truth or would you like some assurance?    Assurance:  Guys will like anything you give him because it's a gift from you.    Truth:  If he's a ring guy he will love it.  If he's in love with you and wants to marry you he will love it.    The problem is to most men jewelry means possession.  We love to give jewelry to women because of this.  If you give a ring to a man it might remind him of marriage.  You just have to be careful that he knows that's not what it means.  Maybe a joke gift right before you give the ring might be the ticket.    But if he knows you are the one, then he'll love it.  Most guys don't really know until 18 months to two years in though.  Good luck.|`|yWIAgfmgaa	Well in my opinion, i believe that the ring should have some sort of significance. I would deff. wear a ring with some sort of signficance, but a ring with none, prob not|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Depends on the guy.Depends on the guy.
