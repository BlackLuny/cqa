jxpV13rTaa	of course it will work on a regular tv. both games and blu ray movies look great on regular tvs, but HD TVs enhance it quite a bit.  if you decide to get an HD TV (highly recommended for true HD experience) then get an LCD tv (wont burn images into your screen) and it must be 1080p (not 720!!). the blu ray player is rated 3rd best of all blu ray players around (blu ray players that compare to the ps3s cabalitities run for about 500-700 dollars alone, so people buy the ps3 for the blu ray player alone). as for games, call of duty 4 or world at war are great. killzone 2 (exclusive to ps3) has the best graphics of any game on any console to date and is very addictive. little big planet is a surprisingly good game as well. cant really explain why, but its fun if you have a couple people with you. as for multimedia, you can add all your music, you can put discs straight into the ps3 and add them or hook it up wirelessly to your computer and just have a single file with all the songs in it and play them through the ps3 (although you cant play music while playing games, but im sure you have another music player if you want to do that). all in all the ps3 is definatley worth getting. if you do get an HDTV in the future, make sure to get an HDMI cable (dont get the 125 dollar ones, just get a 25 dollar one or so, it does the same thing.) and an optical cable for better sound. otherwise just use the RCA cables on a regular tv (not recommended to use RCA cables on an HD tv, doesnt produce a very good picture).|`|QIlhmWwBaa	yeah it works on a normal tv but it would look a whole lot better with an HDTV|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	If u haven't got a hdtv u will have to use the composite cables that come with ps3 and its the same av multiout cables as ps2. Ps3 games and especially bluray movies look very sharp and better contrast, white balance and textures when viewed on a hdtv using hdmi cable.|`|HekFanRvaa	Of course it will, that's why HDMI cable is extra because it is optional. The PS3 system comes with regular AV cables for normal TV. Go for it!|`|AuQBlXdhaa	it will still work on the non-hd tv with the cables that it comes with <br>  but<br>  if you want a better great experience, get an hdtv with an hdmi cable|`|vNY3uN1Zaa	Of course it will its the best system out there|`|jUmwHRRzaa	i have a hdtv and cable, but i found that when i tried playing on it, the game disfigured slightly and was harder to play due to it being such a big screen ( maybe yours is smaller)<br>  <br>  but i find it good quality when playing on a normal tv, also its a lot cheaper, and the graphics will only improve slightly, <br>  <br>  i would suggest leaving the hdtv and cable alone as its not really needed|`|estQv3Hbaa	Why are you asking us this G.O.

8EmeNHyjaa	Mimimum size that right for viewing distance 8 feet is 32 inch<br>  With standard-definition TVs, the rule used to be that viewers would feel comfortable watching a set from a distance of 3 to 6 times the screen size in inches. With HDTV, the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.|`|cAhEFilGaa	The big one.Remember that none would harm your eyes at that distance anyway.|`|0def56bf396dcc0a444aad41e4d88752aa	The first question is whether you are talking about a widescreen TV or a standard TV.  If you are talking standard TV then its personal preference.  Neither will hurt your eyes at that distance.  It just whuchever you are more comfortable with.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are talking about widescreen TV's then your optimal distance is approximately 2.5 times the screen size.  So at 8' the optimal TV would be about 37".  Since you only have a choice of 27 or 32 I would recommend the 32 since it is larger.|`|EvcT7eyBaa	the big one

deqc17Mkaa	There is no option as although Sony is providing support for other controllers they still want you to buy the actual PlayStation 3 controllers. Look at it this way though, at least you can use your controller somewhat, the Xbox and the Wii both don't offer the option to use a PC controller at all.|`|HekFanRvaa	Problem is, it's not really designed for PS3. So it may work but not 100% which renders it useless. Is there a PS button that you could use to quit the game?
RyvKws7Laa	LED is just a type of light source.  That's about all you really need to know for your "What is LED display?" question.  All that means is that an LED type of light source is used for the display rather than a typical bulb (CCFL or what have you).<br>  <br>  There's nothing to watch for in an LED set frankly.  All it does is provide TVs a better image.  There's not really "degrees of LED" though.  Either your TV is LED or it isn't.<br>  <br>  Right now, LED LCDs do give you a solid picture.  But you pay a tremendous price premium for them.  We're talking thousands extra to go that route.  So in that case you get way better bang for the dollar going with Plasma TV.  Unless there's some specific reason why Plasma would not suite you, I would go with Plasma over LED LCD right now.  In the long run LED LCD will give the current Plasma a push, but well at that point the Plasma crowd will be onto OLED and ignoring standard LED LCD.<br>  <br>  OLED is Organic LED.  I don't really know what the ins/outs of the 'organic' mean.  But the catch is you get AMAZING picture quality and super thin sets.  But this technology is not ready for consumers yet.  So far only Sony has a model out.  Its 11" and costs $2,500.  Not really all that practical.  So you'll need to wait some years before considering that one.|`|kA9UY9vMaa	Are you talking about LED rear projection or LED backlit LCD? <br>  <br>  LED rear projection (DLP) televisions are not much different from a standard DLP. The downside of a DLP tv is that you have to replace a bulb every 3 years (which cost $100-300), the LED DLP's bulb is supposed to last as long as the television, however that is not true, if they do have to be replaced then the bulb will cost twice as much money. As far as the picture, the clarity is good but the colors are horrible. Everything tends to look very "neon" they produce very fake looking colors, the greens tend to have a lot of blue in them, and you don't get a true white, you get a bright neon blue color.<br>  <br>  LCD LED, ahh yes these TV's are awesome, the downside to getting an LCD was that they have very weak contrast ratios, contrast ratio means blacker blacks and whiter whites. Plasmas average 100,000-1 million contrasts, LCD's are 25,000-50,000. However LED backlit LCDs will have 1 million + contrast. This also means you will get brighter and richer colors. Not only that but there are plenty of issues with LCD's crapping out here and there, LED LCD's reliability has also skyrocketed, they will have better odds of lasting to their full potential in life. They will be very expensive also, but will probably drop a bit over time. A 52" will start at about 3k.|`|2haFeoOmaa	My pocket calculator is LED display.

Major stores such as Best Buy and GameStop that sell DSs will not be as cheap and you probably are thinking, even if they are used (maybe a $20-50 savings from a new). I don't really support eBay, but I'd say if you want an actual cheap item, you would have to buy from them. There's a lesser chance of somebody selling you a fake, but still look out for DSs sold for $25 and for reliable sellers.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VeN2WBOOaa	from a hobo.... they sell things cheap.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare: If you don't already own it for another system it's on of the best online experiences for PlayStation 3 and it also has a good storyline although the storyline is very short. LittleBigPlanet: although it's nowhere close to a traditional game, the storyline levels and online levels allow you to enjoy the game no matter what and the level editor allows you to express your creativity in almost anyway possible.

Here are the ones I have found:<br>  Resistance: Fall of Man<br>  Kane and Lynch: Dead Men<br>  Haze<br>  Call of Duty: World at War<br>  Conflict: Denied Ops<br>  Lord of the Rings: Conquest<br>  Rainbow Six: Vegas 1 and 2 (but these games are more designed for online with a group of players rather than two player split screen)<br>  <br>  Resistance 2 is not built for two player offline. There is a two player offline mode, but it does not follow the storyline. I've heard it is pretty good and I have heard it is terrible. Not sure who to believe.<br>  <br>  Some of the other suggestions are two player online only, such as Saint Row 2 and GTA4. I don't think this is what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Other games like Call of Duty 4 are two player, split screen, but you only play against each other, so you have to be careful, even if it says two player.<br>  <br>  I put in a link to all things co-op on PS3. This is a great site and will answer all your question about co-op offline play. What you want to look for are games that have split screen (green check in split category), 2 player (or more) split (# split category), and a green check in the "SPC" category.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.co-optimus.com/system/2/playstation_3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.co-optimus.com/system/2/plays...</a>|`|pl2SocVKaa	okay i will give you a bunch <br>  Saints Row 2<br>  Resistance Fall of Man<br>  Resistance 2<br>  Rainbow Six Vegas<br>  Rainbow Six Vegas 2<br>  Call of Duty World at War<br>  LittlebigPlanet<br>  the upcoming Resident Evil 5<br>  Kane and Lynch Dead Men|`|raEUval8aa	LittleBigPlanet is the best for sure. It's really awesome.<br>  <br>  Also, Call of Duty World at War, and Resistance 2 are some other great ones.|`|oB2au3ezaa	Since you two like shooters definitely go with Resistance: Fall of Man, Resistance 2, LittleBigPlanet and Buzz: Quiz TV.<br>  Here are some PSN game you can download straight to your hard drive that are great cooperatively or competitively:  Magic Ball, PAIN (competitive), Pixeljunk Monsters and Super Stardust HD.  Check the demos section for free demos section of the Playstation Store for most of these games.|`|W8av0zNhaa	Resistance 2 is a bit hard if ur a girl....<br>  go for de definite games of the year,,<br>  Grand theft auto iv, saints row 2, fifa o9, brothers in arms hells highway and CoD 5 Is meant to be really good too<br>  hope dis helps
R9AAhsIjaa	Heh, I have a white 3G 16gb iPhone that I'm getting rid of for a Moto Z9. Well, it'll be my backup, at least, I'm not selling it.The iPhone's basic functions are just worthless. And I'm pretty sure my phone hates me. Try ebay..we sold a few that went like hotcakes about six months ago. I think they're cheaper now, though. AT&T has them for $200-$300 if you sign a new contract with them. Walmart has them for a few dollars less than AT&T but I'd stick with AT&T even though they rip you off royally with the iPhone. I pay around $95 a month for my service :o(|`|74lCul0naa	$300. ill make 100 and sync back everything

Then go to "my computer" and look for your phone or something like "usb mass storage".  Open that, and look for a file called "music" and drag all your songs into it.|`|oVouqY6iaa	MusicKP has been a great place for me to obtain a great deal of music.

VJ1C5JsYaa	There is no search option for co-op if you want to play co-op you have to find friends or other people that want to do co-op. Once you have some people that want to do it have them joion your lobby and just make it co-op/campain instead of custom games or matchmaking.|`|aPcIPdkWaa	good question i weanna know that

QriWp4fzaa	the 40 gb and 60 have basically no diff. i have 80 tho waste of mony id say. get the 40 gig one and get killzone. its a fun game. i have call of duty 4. u shuld sell ur wii. its a good deal and bur 40 gb. iv had ps3 for a while. downloaded songs wallpapers, games demos, and only used up 6.3 gigs... 40 gigs is A LOT. its worth it. take the deal.  (u need help setting up online wirelessly or wired e-mail me=P its on my profile:))|`|EfejPjIMaa	Do you plan on playing PS2 games on the PS3?  If you plan on playing PS2 games, then get the 60GB, it is backward compatible.  If you don't plan on playing PS2 games, then get the 40GB, it is not backward compatible.  Both will play PS1 games.  <br>  <br>  Considering the 60GB plays PS2 games, has 4 USB ports instead of 2 USB ports (40GB), and has a built in Flash Card Reader (40GB doesn't), the 60GB is the better deal for only $20 more.  You will also be able to sell a 60GB easier than a 40GB and will get more for it, if you ever decide to sell it.  Memory really doesn't matter since you can upgrade the HDD.<br>  <br>  Go for the 60GB as it is the better PS3, and go mow a lawn or two to get that extra $20 you need to get Killzone 2.|`|c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	sounds like a good deal to me and unless you plan on downloading a lot of stuff, 40 gb would be plenty
XRoV7XyGaa	Wow. I didn't even know about that website. Your answer seems very plausible. If you saw the trailer for Bioshock 2 , you'll see the little sisters (preteen) doing what looks like going into the sea. Anyhow , I can't wait for the release.
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	There's no way to know what chipset it's using other than to look on the back of the 360.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't buy a refurbished 360 from GS because you don't save that much.  Maybe 50 bucks.  I'd rather pay the extra 50 bucks to get a new 360 than to save 50 bucks and get a used 360.|`|q6uyloYdaa	They won't know what chip is in the refurbished ones and they won't tell you. They don't really have a higher RRoD rate, but that problem should be covered by the Microsoft warranty still anyway. You get a 30-day guarantee, but you can buy a 1-year warranty from them as well. The only downside is that there's no hard drive.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	I would not. My aunt bought a refurbished one for my cousin and it got the rings of death two days later.<br>  <br>  I would recommend just saving up and buying the pro for 300 dollars so you won't have problems|`|Fto3FH8Zaa	There not guaranteed chipsets, it's whatever people trade in that they get, but you could always buy one, they have a 7 day no questions asked return policy on used and refurbished items.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	This is a good system but you can get better with Onkyo HT-S6100 that supports audio via HDMI connection. This feature will give you HD sounds from Blu-ray movies such as DTS-HD MA and Dolby True HD.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Onkyo makes bundled home theater systems that are ideal for those who don't want to piece one together themselves.  The HT-S5100 is a good system, but it lacks one feature that is key for HD home theater: HDMI switching.<br>  <br>  You want to be able to run an HDMI from your PS3 and HD cable box to your receiver and then run an HDMI cable out to the TV.  You can't do this with HDMI pass through.  You need HDMI switching.  The good news is the Onkyo HT-S6100, 7100 and 9100 all have HDMI switching.  The bad news is they all cost more.|`|BntHQeWMaa	i have the s6100... its awesome for a htib.get it now<br>  i havent heard this htib with ps3, only movies and sounds pretty good, better speakers out there though, alot.|`|qdqyF5V9aa	I agree w/BANG P, Onkyo makes decent components and their HTIB's are well matched and not "over-priced", too.  I own their TX-SR705 AV receiver as the "guts" of my home theater and I'm extremely pleased with the performance and features.  Definitely factor in HDMI into your purchase plans, anything less and you'll be taking a giant step BACK!!!

To play against other Wii owners that game will have an online mode, which in most games it's usually called Nintendo WFC. Most games will have the option to play against random players, such as, Mario Kart Wii and Super Smash Bros Brawl. Before you do that you just connect your Wii online, if you have a router or neighbors have unlocked connections. If you want to play with friends you have to exchange friend codes, you can find your friend code when your in the game and are connected online. Most games have your friend code under your friends list in the game, not the Wii menu.

The Touch has hundreds of applications, and tons that are free from iTunes. <br>  <br>  The Pros: <br>  Web access via built in Wi-fi<br>  Awesome digital interface <br>  Amazing 3.5in display (awesome for movies)<br>  Lightweight and skinny!<br>  Integrated speaker<br>  <br>  The Cons:<br>  The battery life. (it's not great, but then again, it's not horrible!) <br>  Storage capacity (as opposed to other iPods in the price range)<br>  <br>  Bottom line, If you don't have much music, and willing to pay a little for the awesome Touchscreen; if you want internet access and the coolest iPod ever, then YES! it's worth it. Completely.|`|Sb3FlDXBaa	My friend, go for it.<br>  buy the 32 gig from Sams<br>  if it breaks, take it to them, they will take it, and replace it with a similar product, same price.<br>  when the next ipod touch comes out and their out of stock of the original you bought, if your ipod "breaks", go and get the new one, for free!!!!<br>  its crazy.<br>  oh and jailbreak it, totally worth it.|`|NndSuPCJaa	YESS ITS WORTH IT ITS GREAT I HAVE AN IPOD TOUCH NEVR HAD A PROBLEM WIT IT ITS GREAT U SHOULD GET IT|`|jLYN3crMaa	yes ofcourse its worth it
ig6qg2R4aa	Well unfortunately your warranty is void now, because Apple doesn't care for anything that's been water damaged.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure there's no way to fix it if it's dry. On the bright side, I had an ipod nano (2nd generation) that went through the laundry, I thought it was completely dead and then one day after it was completely dry it started working again. It froze a lot and I couldn't use the hold button anymore because that'd freeze it, but then 2 months after all that, it just started working perfectly again. So, I'm hoping yours will be okay. =)|`|7HGeOJs0aa	There is no way to get the water out of your ipod unless you open it up and there is no way it will work again sorry...|`|Mboh3eVCaa	Your supposed to use the beads trick (you can also use rice) as soon as you get it wet, so it might not work at this point.  Basically just put your iPod and the beads/rice in a container or bag with the beads/rice surrounding the iPod for roughly 24 hours.<br>  <br>  If it's been a few days it probably should have dried out at this point...I would still try the beads/rice trick, but I'm thinking that it's probably fried.  I'm sorry for you loss!!|`|nftYy1M1aa	put it in a bowl of rice or the beads that soak up water or even baking soda (wait im not so sure about the baking soda though)..<br>  There are two ways you can use it.. Put the iPod into a bowl filled with the dehydrating agent. Or you can put your iPod into a bowl with the agent and HOLD it like 20cms over a stove.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure though, this is just my chemistry classes kicking in xD Sorry! But before you try any of this, check if you have a warranty, thatd be so much easier.<br>  I saw this article on Yahoo! recently about how to fix electronics that have been in contact with water, try to find it? Good luck|`|r7tllHjuaa	As with other electronic devices like cell phones, water damage means "the end" for the product. Ask her to get you a new once since its her fault for being negligent if you were washing someones clothes wouldn't you check the pockets first?|`|4S4BHl35aa	Ask your mother if she got a warranty when you got your ipod. If she didn't, you'll have to buy another one.|`|QRGLuQ8xaa	No, there is nothing you can do. If it wont turn on, there's no luck. Even if you could soak out all the water, it still wouldn't work.  It's has, essentially, fried itself.  What has been damaged inside by water, is already damaged completely.  Sorry to hear of your loss!<br>  <br>  The only way it's possible to survive is if certain critical parts of the iPod weren't saturated... which is highly improbable if it was washed. They're not sealed that well.

From about.com<br>  <br>  Definition: Plasma is a distinct phase of matter, separate from the traditional solids, liquids, and gases. It is a collection of charged particles that respond strongly and collectively to electromagnetic fields, taking the form of gas-like clouds or ion beams. Since the particles in plasma are electrically charged (generally by being stripped of electrons), it is frequently described as an "ionized gas." <br>  <br>  Plasma was first identified (as "radiant mattter") by Sir William Crookes in 1879. Sir J.J. Thomson identified the nature of the matter in 1897.

Zdyd7rYtaa	I'm believing your referring to the one with putting the five rhinos in their respective places. First off, what I did was used some of the skulls that I got in previous missions namely the ones that give you extra HP and supplies and stuff to come faster. Than what I did is built everything up on my base (namely the turrets and upgraded all of those) and also created infantry and used the special upgrades to get an extra ten guys. Then what I did is I one by one started to produce those rhinos and then took about 8 infantry guys at each location except in the third position in which I used 4 (the third position does not get hit as bad as 1,2,4 & 5, I also made sure those positions were also cleared out of the Covenant) It took me about 20-25 minutes doing and then once that was done the MAC blasts are an absolute sinch and WALLA!!! mission done. The skulls are the main thing to do in order to progress through Halo Wars on the harder difficulties. I knew somebody that got through to 5 on Legendary without the skulls before he changed the difficulty but it will get easier if you use the skulls to your advantage.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Use your transport. I believe you press up on the d-pad then pull the left stick to the transport and pick up the rhino and move it to that location.|`|Ovs2GjeHaa	How do you get the Third Tank into position?

QriWp4fzaa	if u wanna juss play games, get 60. if u wanna download some stuff like music and stuff, get 80. 60 gig is alot if u wanna juss play games. but if u wanna store alot of other things like songs, then get 80. that way u still have alot of space and ps3 not slow.|`|YhdfaEJVaa	Well they are all right but let me elaborate. First off if your talking about buying one soon. The 60gb are no longer in production so you would have to find one used at a local gamestore.<br>  <br>  Now to your question <br>  The 60gb is probaly the most sought after ps3 because it is 100% Backwards compatible with all ps2 games.  Because it has the hardware from the ps2 in it which allows fully compatibilty. It also has 4 Usb slots and SD/CF/ pro stick memory slots for easy picture transfering and other data transfering. <br>  <br>  Now the 80GB ps3 depends on which one your talking about. If you are talking about the 80gb ps3's that came with motorstorm or metal gear solid 4 then they are nearly as good as the 60gb however the hardware from the ps2 is not in it. Sony used software emulation which achieve about 80-90% of the ps2 library which it can play. But it still has everything else mentioned above.<br>   <br>  Now if your talking about the new 80gbs then they compared to the first two ps3's I mentioned then it is last as far as best. Because it doesn't have neither the hardware from ps2 or the software emulation in it. However like all ps3's it can play most ps1 games. <br>  <br>  Now if your worried about capacity for memory just buy the cheaper one and upgrade to 500GB's with a 2.5" Sata harddrive 4500rpm for about 110 dollars. And use the old hardrive for an external hard drive for ps3 or whatever you like. <br>  <br>  Sidenote all ps3's 60, 80, 160 have same ps3 parts in it so it doesn't play any different the ps3 games its just misisng ps2 hardware or software emulation. And you can't modify the new 80gb or 160gb to play ps2 games.|`|vgO8E0NCaa	60 gig. It has 100% backwards compatibilty and it has 2 extra USB slots and an SD Card Reader. <br>  <br>  Depends if you'd rather prefer 20 gig more.<br>  <br>  But i bought the 60gb in 2007.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Technically 60GB is much better, but it's discontinued. So I think 80GB is better as in right now cause 60GB's are hard to find unless your lucky.|`|AtG0HULCaa	I have an 80GB and it plays every single Ps2 game I hav without any flaws.  The 80 is also faster when it comes to downloading things from the PSN store.  If you're going to play online, get an 80 otherwise get a 60. <br>  PS make sure it is not one of the newer 80 gig's they have 0% compatability.|`|wzA4GcWKaa	60GIG ps3 all the way thank god i didnt sold mines woot..lol|`|Hiasgb75aa	The 60GB is by far the best PS3. Alot of people still choose not to buy PS3's because they don't have backwards compatibility anymore|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The 60 gb by all means.<br>  <br>  The 60 gb has pretty much close to 100% backward compatibility with PS2 games.<br>  <br>  The old 80 gb has maybe 80 to 90% backward compatibility with PS2 games.<br>  <br>  The new 80 gb has 0% backward compatibility with PS2 games.

jxpV13rTaa	killzone 2. has a better ranking system than COD (only wish there were more ranks ). in COD, you only unlock things when you rank up. Killzone 2 is different, you unlock when your done challenges. killzone 2 has much better graphics and a decent selection of guns. its just very addictive|`|fWclxi9Baa	well i wanna say this i have given up on cod waw for the online play everytime i kill someone i get killed while as in cod4 i could get 20 kills and 7 deaths a game also resistance 2 is fun but its really fast paced its fun|`|AXwJsjQ2aa	Definitely Killzone 2.

3CJAUyqPaa	Yes - but your version of FinalCut needs to be the CURRENT version running on an Intel-Mac. Earlier versions or PPC based Macs cannot deal with AVCHD-encoded (MTS) files.<br>  <br>  ++++++++++++<br>  <br>  Connect that camcorder using a USB cable - and the camcorder is in PC mode. The hard drive will mount like any other mass storage device. Copy the video files to the Mac. Presuming you are running a Intel Mac with an appropriate version of FinalCut, just drag the MTS files to the Log and Capture area of FinalCut.
M79W3Ct9aa	gofish is right.  You aren't supposed to use a HD that spins at 7200 RPMs.  It will damage your PS3.  Only use HDs that spin at 5400 RPMs.|`|EfejPjIMaa	A 7200 RPM drive will void your warranty, assuming you still have a waranty.  The time difference between the 5400 and 7200 drives is a matter of 1/2 to 4 seconds difference.  You can check out a comparison here: <a href="http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/138288/7200rpm-vs-5400rpm-does-ps3-hard-drive-speed-matter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/...</a><br>  <br>  The 7200 will cause more heat, which could become a problem down the line.  Considering the speed difference is really not a factor on the PS3, go for the GB.  I have upgraded to a 320GB HDD, and I have already used 200GB of it.  Depending on what you plan on putting on the PS3, the bigger the HDD the better.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	There is a little difference, in terms of speed, but that's it. The load times will differ by about 1-3 seconds. But why settle for only 250GB.

The 7200 rpm won't damage anything, but it won't improve load speeds or anything either. <br>  <br>  Go with the 250gb. It's a good size (likely more then you'll ever need) so you'll never have to upgrade again.|`|fWclxi9Baa	you do know you can only add a 5400 rpm the 7200 will cause the ps3 to malfunction its to fast|`|TmDabvoIaa	nothing noticeable! go for the one that gives you the value for money|`|kXlQNegGaa	Go with the 500GB HD.  I got mine for $109 from Newegg.com.   The load times between the 5400 and 7200 are unnoticeable and the increased speed might increase internal temp slightly but won't harm the console only trigger the fan to come on more for cool down.  Make sure to use the old HD for an external backup giving you more memory.

So1T9DKPaa	70-200 has weather-sealed to it.  Better optical and build quality.  So 70-200 is better quality that's why it is more expensive than the 70-300.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	The 70-200 f/4 L will have the better image quality, hands down.<br>  <br>  The 70-300 mm lens is a good lens, but Canon's L series is their professional line of lenses.<br>  <br>  The f/4 has a constant aperture so even at 200 mm you will can still shoot in lower light situations.  It lacks the extra length, but it will make up for it in image quality and available uses.  The 70-300 will be virtually worthless in lower light situations.<br>  <br>  If you have the money, go for the 70-200 f/4 L IS.

xTioPxaVaa	Remember the movie trailer line for some sci-fi movie that said "...In space, no one can hear you scream."<br>  <br>  Do you know why?  NO AIR!<br>  <br>  Your eardrum responds to variations in air pressure to interpret them as sound.  At the other end of the process, the speaker converts electrical energy into acoustic energy by moving air.  A vast oversimplification, but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  With subwoofers, the waves are long enough that it's easier to feel them, versus a midrange speaker or tweeter.<br>  <br>  I worked a Motley Crue show (local crew)...Theater of Pain I believe...and Nikki's bass rig on stage literally made your jeans flap from the air being moved.|`|IY9JolQ4aa	LOL this question is actually kinda funny...|`|nnPCSS4Haa	The diaphragm of the speaker pumps out air from the speaker box as it flexes within the box.

AA10771428	Do you mean iPhone? First of all, I really don't think you get 3G on an iPod Touch...
IY9JolQ4aa	If it says it is charging and the battery doesn't last then it's just a bad battery.|`|AA10047095	it could be wear and tear, ipods unfortunetly do not last, you could try the basics like resetting it (hold menu and middle button for a few minutes) or downloading the lastest software off itunes.   <br>  <br>  Alternativly you could place it in the fridge over night, for some reason this technich seems to work well works for me anyway, no idea why.   <br>  <br>  what harm can it do.|`|NQIuRFyjaa	Well I'm not entirely sure, and please dont hold me to my answer, but I do think its time for a new battery.  Then again I have an iTouch, but i have heard stories about your problem.

AA10775666	I don't think so...if your phone is lost, call your service provider about it.
xbQhnEzuaa	yes you can. the jailbreak that is out right now is a tethered one. meaning if u take off ur ipod after jailbreaking it u wont be able to boot it back up. unless u connect it to ur computer and follow some steps in order to get it to boot back up. but this is pretty easy to do. yes you can get the firmware. i would suggest that you get firmware 2.2.1. and jailbreak that. you could look for the download on goole. if you dont mind a tethered jailbreak then use cyw00d to jailbreak ur ipod. look up dinozamba on youtube and follow the steps he shows on his videos. it will work. if u run into any problems dont worry because they can be fixed. this voids ur warranty also.|`|pfn6cXkNaa	The people who do this stuff haven't released an official version yet, i think you can get some weird version like redsnow but I would wait to get it when it comes out officially and do it safely.

XmsIgobraa	I personally have an ipod second generation and i am in LOVE with it. It is thinner than the 1st generation and the outer speaker definitely comes in handy for me. When i'm hanging with friends i usually blast my music without needing additional speakers. I would say get the 2nd generation and you will not be disappointed!|`|pfn6cXkNaa	everything is the same apart from you can jailbreak an ipod 1st gen and can't jailbreak a 2nd gen, the 2nd gen is a tiny bit slimmer, it has a speaker and is a bit more expensive.<br>  all depends on what you want and how much money you want to spend
o6pdnnU8aa	Yes, but, don't upgrade too high, otherwise you can't do HomeBrew.  For Example: maybe you want old games like PacMan on your PSP.<br>  <br>  Sony is trying to stop people from putting, non-PSP games on the PSP.<br>  <br>  If your PSP comes pre-loaded with the newest FirmWare, don't upgrade at all.  Wait until a Downgrader release becomes available.  The official release may take some time.<br>  <br>  I kicked myself after upgrading.<br>  <br>  This site specializes in Video Game System Firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.dark-alex.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dark-alex.org/</a><br>  <br>  or join Dark Alex's Forum For Free<br>  <a href="http://www.dark-alex.org/forum" rel="nofollow">http://www.dark-alex.org/forum</a>

It's worth it because otherwise you can't use the app store, you can't use safari, google maps, pandora, or most of the other things that already come on the phone. If you don't need to use the internet or download games, you don't need the iPhone. Get an iTouch, and then use a regular cell phone.

wTwppABQaa	It's best to charge a phone when it's low, since hey tend to develop a "memory" if you constantly recharge them early; which will shorten the life of the battery. <br>  <br>  No, it's not bad to take cell phone out while charging and it's not done.<br>  <br>  Yes, Overcharging is bad, causes your battery to overheat, don't charge it more then 24 hrs.|`|mSPr7nhWaa	It will take longer to charge if its low instead of almost low.  It's not bad if you unplug the phone and still take it out when it's not done charging.  I don't think the phone is capable of overcharging....it stops when it's done.

pLCLtbtFaa	Hmm.. tough situation!<br>  I don't think you have any choice except for try to sell it with the contract, like you're already doing. I think the cheapest option for you would be to just keep it, since you will pay less in a year when you're not really using many minutes for it than having to pay the $300 to cancel the contract. If you can't keep it, then your only option will be to pay the $300.<br>  Good luck. :)|`|4duANUkHaa	yes|`|qWicVoU9aa	What carrier do you have?  $300 sounds afwul steep to cancel a contract.

Xg2WuQ0uaa	It depends on the connections of your particular monitor.<br>  <br>  The PS3 won't actually go through the PC (unless you were to use a TV tuner card, which is difficult and has poor resolution). You'll just need your monitor. If your monitor has an HDMI input then you're all set. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you'd be that lucky. You probably have a DVI input at best. <br>  <br>  You'll need an HDMI to DVI adapter, which you can find at electronics stores, or more cheaply online at newegg.com or tigerdirect.com (or similar sites). Then use the adapter to plug the PS3 in.<br>  <br>  If its only for a few days its not worth the trouble or the money for the adapter. I don't even know how you plug your PS3 in now, so you might not even have an HDMI cable. I'm also not sure that they sell an HDMI to VGA adapter (they probably don't as I've never heard of anyone using one). <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd just wait it out, or temporarily move the PS3 to a different TV if you have one.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	If your monitor has an HDMI input, then just use that. If not, buy a VGA adapter.|`|mavWffD5aa	Step 1: If your computer monitor has a DVI port, buy a HDMI to DVI converter or cable.The cable runs for about $10 and the converter is $15. However, if you have a new, fancy monitor, just plug a HDMI cable from your PS3 and into the HDMI port on your monitor. <br>  <br>  Step 2: Once you have bought the cable or converter, plug the cable (HDMI Side) into the PS3 and the DVI side into your monitor.If you bought the converter, plug the DVI end into your monitor and plug the HDMI cable into the other end of your converter and the other end of the HDMI cable into your PS3's HDMI port. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Now you have picture but you do not have sound as sound does not run through a DVI port. So you need to buy a Y-Adapter which go fro about $5 and a a 3.5mm female to female coupler. These run for about $3. Now plug the PS3's AV Cable into your PS3 and plug the white and red colored RCA jacks into the Y-Adapter. Then plus the stereo side of the Y-Adapter into your coupler and plug headphones or speakers into the other side. Now you have SOUND and PICTURE. <br>  <br>  I know this is confusing and complicated but it really is quite a difficult process and you really need to know what stuff to buy.<br>  <br>  Converter Link and HDMI Cable: <a href="http://www.sanace.com/IT/images/dvi-hdmi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.sanace.com/IT/images/dvi-hdmi...</a> and <a href="http://www.playstation3hdmicable.com/images/hdmi2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.playstation3hdmicable.com/ima...</a><br>  <br>  DVI to HDMI Cable: <a href="http://www.jdr.com/interact/..%5Cimages%5Cproducts%5CC%5Ccbl-hdmi-dvi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jdr.com/interact/..%5Cimages%...</a><br>  <br>  Y-Adapter: <a href="http://images.philips.com/is/image/PhilipsConsumer/SWA3552_10-GAL-global?wid=430&hei=430&$jpglarge$" rel="nofollow">http://images.philips.com/is/image/Phili...</a><br>  <br>  Female to Female Coupler: <a href="http://www.wiredco.com/images/3.5MMCOUPLER.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiredco.com/images/3.5MMCOUPL...</a><br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS AND GOOD LUCK.
eVptHOOBaa	How is it broken? Broken in half? Lens shattered, LCD cracked, etc? Or it just won't work?<br>  <br>  Technically speaking, if you broke it - you can't return it, if it was defective - you should be able to...<br>  <br>  That said, Costco is one of those retailers that would likely take just about anything back, so you may give it a try either way... By the way, even if you bought it online, you can bring it back to the warehouse and return in person, so that you don't have to pay shipping and than sit there guessing if it is going to get accepted, etc.<br>  <br>  Last but not least - if you broke the camera and Costco refuses to take it back, call your credit card. Some credit cards give you automatic 90 days insurance that covers everything charged to the card for just about any kind of loss, including being accidentally broken or stolen! That's if you charged it to a credit card, of course!<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	The 90 day warranty guarantees that if it breaks within those 90 days that you can return it, so yes you should be able to return it. BUT you should make sure that you have the warranty with you.

If you have a regular account, they don't take any minutes away<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't cost to get the balance message. Its not technically a text message. Likewise, all texts that come from AT&T are free.<br>  <br>  Yes, it costs you minutes to check your Mailbox, if you are doing it during a time when you use regular minutes. If you don't want to be charged, just check your mail at night or on the weekend.<br>  <br>  If you have the nights and evenings plan, you should be able to make free calls after 7 or 9pm, depending on which plan you chose.

Only the 20gb, 60gb, and old 80gb (none of which are in production anymore) play PS2 games. The 20 and 60gb play PS2 games using hardware emulation (~90% of PS2 games work), and the old 80gb uses software emulation (~80% PS2 games work).<br>  <br>  PS3 games are all bluray, even if they don't necessarily need the space. Consoles have standards that must be kept to be published for the console. Bluray is one of those requirements (for a number of reasons including security). It also gives a number of benefits including better disc protection, as all bluray discs all have a scratch resistant coating. The PS3 can play other media as well though. PS1 games are all CDs,which obviously work (as stated above). Music CDs, and DVDs also play on the PS3, as well as PS2 DVDs on the PS3 models that can play them.<br>  <br>  PS1 and PS2 memory cards cannot be used. You can get an adapter to transfer saves from the physical PS1/PS2 cards to the "virtual memory cards" on the PS3, but you can not save data to the old cards. <br>  <br>  A double layered DVD has about 8gb of data, and a double layered bluray disc has about 50gb. The added space is used to store larger files (meaning better textures), video (MGS4 cutscenes), and any other reasons the developers might utilize it for. For movies it means better resolution (up to 1080p). As I said above though, the PS3 can play both bluray movies as well as regular DVD movies.<br>  <br>  The system I would recommend is the PS3. If you can get a backwards compatible PS3, it's basically like having 3 consoles in one.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	Wow.  I hope Yahoo! charged you 40 points.<br> <br> Only the earlier versions of the PS3 support PS2 games.  20gb, 60gb, and the 80gb MGS4 bundle.  All others don't support PS2 games.<br> <br> Every PS3 will play PS1 games.<br> <br> The controller layout didn't change.  The L2 and R2 are more of a trigger style (for the better if you ask me).<br> <br> Yes games must be blu-ray.  <br> <br> I think only the 60 gb had any sort of memory slots and I don't think PS2 readers were included.  You can buy one separately though.<br> <br> Blu-Ray discs hold data that's equivalent to about 4 standard DVDs.  Its a storage disc.  Protective coating placed on them makes the discs scratch resistant.<br> <br> What do I recommend?  You listed every game console made in the last 15 years.  You a first time gamer or something?  Get a PS3 if you have the money.  Its the best overall console availabe now and provides the best value in the long run.  PS2 isn't going anywhere though.  Game developers are still making games for it and they're still making lots of money.<br> <br> Get the 360 if you want the absolute best in online gaming.  Microsoft is trying to phase out the original Xbox cuz they'd rather you get the newer 360.  That's Microsoft for you.<br> <br> Get a Wii if you want to be interactive with the game.  <br> <br> Who still plays on their PS1 console?  And Gamecube?  What the heck is that? (sarcasm)  Inferior consoles in this day and age.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Only the PS3 60 and 80GB with 4 USB ports can play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  Yes, if you buy the adapter connecting your PS2 controller to your PS3.<br>  <br>  Yes......(I'm not sure cause your Q isn't like complete) PS3 can play Blue-ray, DVDs, CD players, etc......<br>  <br>  No, unless you buy the adapter from your memory card to your PS3.<br>  <br>  Blue-ray basically can hold 10 times memory than regular CD's.

Meaning it can probably have longer and more detailed <br>  <br>  I don't think it can use ps2 and 1 memory cards. Maybe it can.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt reccomend game cube, xbox , playstation or playstation 2 because they are old and the only one of those they actually continue to make are PS2.<br>  <br>  get a will only if your playing with kids under 13.. you can get an xbox or 360. they are both good but ps3 will last longer. because it uses technology that's probably equal to the NEXT set of gaming consoles that will be made.. because of the blue ray and Blue tooth stuff it uses. proccessors too.<br>  <br>  xbox 360 has more games and a better online playing system but cost $50 for 13 months. i think.<br>  <br>  xbox 360 can play xbox 1 games. if you want to connect to the internet wireslessly with 360 it will cost you an extea $100. The ps3 has wireless internet built in. <br>  <br>  If you like sony stuff though you can trust the ps3. if you want to get something that will last a bit longer get the ps3.<br>  <br>  the 360 is also very good because its got more games and a better online service.

j5Apt8hWaa	My friends that can afford it, say the 14-24 mm extreme wide angle lens is THE sharpest lens they have ever used.<br>  <br>  Any of the macro lenses made by Nikon will be extra sharp.<br>  <br>  Pretty much any of the Nikon lenses that have the new nano-coating, will be so sharp that the sensor will not be able to resolve up to the resolution of the lens.<br>  <br>  All that said 1) how sharp your images are depends upon your ability to hold the camera still so there is no blur caused by camera movement during the exposure and 2) I have never found a soft Nikkor lens .. some are just sharper than others ... and more expensive.
sGWKMwdJaa	My dad has metro pcs and he pays $50 a month and yes it is unlimited!Unlimited calls and text and web.<br>  But the problem is the phones are expensive.<br>  <br>  You can also activate SOME verizon wireless and/or sprint phones with metro pcs but what sucks is that they tend to activate the "ugly" ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally I don't like metro pcs.There is some places it gets signals and some places that don't and the phones they have are kind of lame.I like phones that are in so yea.<br>  <br>  The paying methods are you pay on the day you activate the phone<br>  and if you don't pay and a month passes they cancel your account.If you want to get a account again with them again you get a new number!They don't ask for credit check and all that mess that's what's good about it.No contract.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	MetroPCS has unlimited everything (depending on the plan you get). They only downside is if you travel outside their calling zone, then you have to add money to your account and it works like a bank for your roaming minutes to be deducted from.<br>  <br>  Oh and now you can use phones from different carriers (Sprint and verizon i think)<br>  I've had Metro for 7 years, I love it|`|Ne9fbdLdaa	Yes it is. But it sucks, The phones are horrilbe.<br>  Get T-Moblie(:
HVQFVtelaa	Turn it off, take out the battery, then replace it. If the dots come back it is probably damaged too badly to fix.
pLCLtbtFaa	The good: The Samsung Instinct offers a slick, intuitive design and a heavy load of powerful, innovative, and easy-to-use features. It particularly shines as a messaging and GPS device.<br>  <br>  The bad: The Samsung Instinct lacks Wi-Fi and instant messaging, and its call and video quality were erratic. Also, its Internet browser could be refined, its internal memory is small, and its camera lacks editing features.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. :) I think the Samsung Instinct is totally worth it. I also like the Samsung better than the Palm Centro.<br>  Good luck!

T1NzVqvJaa	I just got an IT yesterday! The ipod touch comes with many different apps such as facebook, AIM,myspace, tons of games like word games,adventures,action,news,sports,busi... and most of wich are free. Now it says that you have to upload pictures from the computer but theres a secret way to do it. Through a free app called Backgrounds.<br>  Other things the ipod includes is a daily music workout. You go to settings and touch nike and select a song, then pick what workout you would like to do. Its good for on the treadmeal, outside walking and any sport!. The ipod touch comes with stickers, and earphones but no charger. But if you plug it into the computer, it will automatically charge.<br>  Hope this helps|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i dont think it comes with any Apps but they have several that you can either download for free or buy. thats really all it has to offer other than the music, i love mine though, dont get me wrong. i love it way better than my other ipods. have fun :)|`|jeZ1UJmLaa	it is very simple just get ur touch. and go to the already installed itunes app and simply go to free apps. and u can do watever u want like games and other fun interesting things like if ur in a certain city u can get an app that tell u a good resturatunt to go to.|`|2nXrQhkeaa	It's pretty cool. There are some really fun games.<br>  And, if you have a wifi connection around you, you could download a Myspace app or a Facebook app. You can also watch youtube videos.<br>  OHOHOH AND you can download all that stuff from your ipod.

3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	f you have a mini dvd camcorder….<br>  You will have to finalize your dvd in the camera and then put the dvd in your computer's DVD burner (top loading only) and then you will have to convert the files (I downloaded handbrake file converter free) and import them into your editing program. Use the HELP feature in your editing program to learn about editing. Once you are ready to burn, your project will be burned to a different DVD and you can file the original away.<br>  WMM is not the best ediing software. I use pinnacle studio 11 ultimate but there are others comparable.|`|3CJAUyqPaa	That camcorder is a standard definition DVD based unit that records to very highly compressed VOB files.<br>  <br>  Download and install HandBrake<br>  <a href="http://handbrake.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://handbrake.fr/</a><br>  (or any of the other gazillion DVD rippers out there) and rip the video to a format Adobe CS3 or MovieMaker can deal with - like .avi, .wmv... among many others.<br>  <br>  Alert: DVD based camcorders provide the worst possible video for editing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
zBllCc9faa	Haha a ______ killed you, make of pathetic I have a priest and ive seen a pacifist so try something like "haha the pilsbury doughboy"|`|Xg2WuQ0uaa	I tend to use greek gods as inspiration for my online names (Cenobia is actually a character from Shadow of Colossus, but I have used greek gods in the past). Also I like weapons.<br>  <br>  If you combine the two you can think of some interesting things and put a spin on it. For example, instead of Poseidon's Trident, you could use PoseidonsFork, or TheSpoonOfPoseidon, etc.<br>  <br>  My brother actually uses the names of obscure diseases. For example, when you kill someone it might say "Meningitis killed Whoever". That's kind of a cool effect. <br>  <br>  Basically I like to have names with a background or some meaning attached to them.

HVQFVtelaa	Seriously? If you are a sound sleeper you need one that would startle you out of sleep, something that does not sound normal to you. <br>  <br>  To a confirmed bachelor, i would recommend loud baby crying, or the wedding march, that would scare crap out of him.<br>  <br>  To a country music redneck, I would recommend heavy metal or loud rap, that would get him out of bed. <br>  <br>  What would work for you? Soothing tunes don't always make you leap out of bed like your shorts were on fire.<br>  <br>  How about a short recording of:   Bang, Bang, Bang, Open up, it's the Police! That would do it for me.

8BtuPcrpaa	I have the LG Dare from Verizon Wireless. It's absolutely wonderful, l have no complaints at all. The music is pretty chill because it can keep playing even while you text, change settings or just play around. The texting is great because there is so much versatility. You can draw the letters (takes a little longer), use a standard T9 keypad, or (my personal favorite and the most common use) the QWERTY keypad. It's extremely easy to use because the touchscreen is very responsive and gives tactile feedback. It may take a little while to get used to but in the end it just comes naturally. It is definetly worth the price, I can tell you that much. Good luck with whatever you decide to get!

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	The Canon EF 28-90mm lens that you speak of will work 100% with a Canon Digital Rebel XSi. Because of the 1.6x crop factor of the XSi, the lens will effectively become a 45-144mm lens (in 35mm equivalency); it'll be a normal to telephoto lens. I think you are familiar with focal lengths so I will make no assumptions of what your focal length needs are or should be. Remember that the 28-90mm lens was meant for film cameras so it may not preform as well on a DSLR.<br>  <br>  The 18-55mm lens on a XSi is equivalent (1.6x crop factor) to your 28-90mm lens mounted on your K2. If you find that the 28-90mm wide to short-telephoto focal length range on your K2 (35mm film) is sufficient for your needs then the 18-55mm kit lens will be ideal for you. It's a typical kit lens so it won't give you the same results of a $1,200 lens, but it's a good starter lens.

j5Apt8hWaa	Major differences.<br>  <br>  Obviously the f/2.8 is a stop faster and thus it is easier to control depth of field.<br>  <br>  The f/2.8 is used mostly by sports photographers shooting indoors and fashion photographers as well.<br>  <br>  The f/4 lens is excellent for shooting any outdoor sports or portraits.<br>  <br>  Of course there is the little nearly $750 difference in cost.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	Ace rocked it! There is no better answer!|`|pDcJGptPaa	The f/2.8 is better for low light conditions, which is why Ace pointed out that indoor photographers prefer this over the f/4. But the 2.8 is also bigger and heavier. You would be amazed how light the f/4 is compared to the f2.8, even with the image stabilization. And with the IS (image stabilization), you can achieve a few f-stops better, which would get you closer to the f/2.8 range. Much more comfortable to lug around. Feather light. Actually, the best deal these days is the 70-200mm f/4 without IS  because you can pick one up for $600 new and it is "L" glass. Or find a used one in the high $400 range. USM stands for ultrasonic motor, which both of these lenses feature.

Go in and ask, tell them what type of camera you have, and they'll help you find the correct one.

9M8lEQDqaa	What exactly are you trying to do with your SD card?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ohhh Unfortunately it's not that simple. Heres a step by step process I found on the Internet.<br>  You need<br>  SD Gecko (Gamecube SD Card Adapter) or the Gamecube SD to front SD Mod.<br>  SD Card (No bigger than 2GB)<br>  Gamecube Controller<br>  DVD Burner<br>  Blank DVD Media<br>  <br>  1.<br>  Download this file BootableDisc3.rar and unrar it into your C: drive.<br>  <br>  2.<br>  Unzip SoftDev’s sddvd-01g.dol file into the “my_bootable_disc” located in the C: drive.<br>  <br>  3.<br>  Open up the command prompt by typing in “cmd” (without the quotes) into the run command (click Start, then click on Run). Once the command prompt has opened, type in “cd\” (without the quotes) and then hit enter. This will get you to the root directory which is “C:\”. Now type in “mkisofs.exe -R -J -G C:\my_bootable_disc\gbi.hdr -no-emul-boot -b sddvd-01g.dol -o GameCopy.iso C:\my_bootable_disc” (without the quotes) then hit enter.<br>  <br>  4.<br>  1) Unzip filechop.exe into the same directory as GameCopy.iso <br>  2) create new pure text document using Notepad.<br>  3) Paste the following text in the document:<br>  <br>  filechop.exe GameCopy.iso 1459978240<br>  <br>  5.<br>  Now there should be a file called GameCopy.iso with the correct size of a Gamecube Game on your C: drive. Just burn that with ImgBurn and place it in your wii. Once you start up this disc, it’ll go staight into the DVD Dumping screen. Follow the directions on the screen.<br>  This will format your SD card and prepare it for dumping. Then insert original game when prompted to, and it will continue to dump the game onto the SD card in chunks. Once a chunk is done, you can then bring the SD card to your computer and Cut and Paste the files it creates into a folder on your computer. Once all chunks have been saved onto your computer you may continue to next step.<br>  <br>  6.<br>  (Creating ISO) Now extract “hjsplit” and open hjsplit.exe. Click ‘Join’. Click on ‘Input File’ and select the FIRST chunk of the game (note: all chunks MUST BE in the same folder!) (also note you only need to join the game, DO NOT join the MD5 chunks!). The Output should automatically be filled in. Then click on ‘Start’. Once it finishes go into that folder and you’ll see the newly created image file of the game. You may continue to burn that file onto a DVD to later be played on your WII!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: This is a compressed 1.4 GB File so it may take a little time to extract.<br>  This has been tested to work with a D2C Wii modded with a D2CKey and a D2B Wii modded with a WiiKey. Both Wii’s with the latest firmware.

VMVW3E7Aaa	Read your manual !!!<br>  <br>  However, I would never use such a feature for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  ? You are very limited in what you can do.<br>  ? The function isn't always reliable or accurate. The camera's idea of "red" might be different to yours. It will often include/exclude areas that don't want to be included/excluded.<br>  ? Imagine  if you just happened to take your best photo ever, but instead of having a real color photo, you only have some partial b&w thing that might look totally awful. You'd kick yourself.<br>  ? If you do the "Selective or Partial Desaturation" (as it is called correctly) in post processing, you have much more control over it, and will get a way better result. Plus you can keep your original color version, too.<br>  <br>  This also applies to any color effects done in camera like b&w or sepia - you're better off NOT to.<br>  <br>  If you don't have your own image editor, you can go to www.picnik.com and use their effects menu which makes it very easy.

Actually, having a PS2 and running it through RF is a total waste.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you have no input alternatives you just need an RF adapter. The PS3 uses the same exact cord as the PS2 (the plug for the regular RCA output is the same), so you don't need to search for a special adapter that fits both. <br>  <br>  Really you should just get someone to pick you up a $5 universal remote if you don't live near any store and aren't going out.

Thats what the original 3 red lights were supposed to mean, however this is what people refer to as RROD or red ring of death.  and is normally caused by faulty soldering that heats up and comes loose rendering the main CPU useless. (sorry!)<br>  4=means either your A/V cable or power cable are not connected/failing.<br>  <br>  NOTE*** Warranty info- 1 year for most problems (unless voided by opening system/getting it wet)<br>  3 years if you have RROD (3 red lights) So call 1-800-469-9269 or go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/registerdevice.aspx?step=repair" rel="nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/n...</a> (unless your past 3 years or voided) register it and the repair only takes about 10-16 days round trip.

AA12275186	Yes and no. Perhaps an education will serve you best, There are two major groups. Synthesizer produces sound by generating tones and allowing a user to modify them. A workstation reproduces samples of actual recorded instruments and allow a user the ability to alter and record them. I guess the biggest consideration is your application. For live performance almost anything that sounds ok and produces the sounds your looking for will work fine. For recording application I'd consider a workstation such as the Roland XP series.|`|347ab5f440822c89c7f7825d0a8a06e6aa	I would go with Korg for live performances.

Do you mean to your surround sound receiver?<br>  <br>  Assuming you did mean the TV, you go from the Audio Out RCA jacks on the CD player to any audio inputs on the TV. Then, you select that input on the TV and the CD player plays through the TV's speakers.<br>  <br>  If you meant hooking a CD player to a surround sound receiver, you hook the output of the CD player (RCA cables) to one of the sets of audio inputs on the back of the receiver. You then select that input to hear that audio. You might also have to select a stereo mode on the receiver, because I have never heard of a "surround sound CD player".<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Okay, I get it. You want to play the TV audio through the stereo. Just look for the Audio Output jacks (RCA-type) on the back of the TV. These will probably be red and white jacks, next to a yellow Video Out jack. Connect these to the red and white audio jacks for the AV Input on the stereo. When you turn on the TV, go to the menu function that allows you to control the TV audio setup. <br>  <br>  First, you want to turn the TV speakers off (use the menu to hunt around - there should be a setting somewhere). Next, set up the audio output for a fixed volume level. This turns up the audio output on your TV all the way up, so it's at the same level as the CD player. You then control the master volume with the stereo.<br>  <br>  If, however, you do not have audio output jacks on the back of your TV, you cannot hook the TV audio up to play through the stereo.|`|a91fdc98672c951bb2b3dbcd91d1b581aa	I'm not sure you can do this if anything connect the rca outputs of the dvd player to your stereo inputs play the music through the stereo.

I'm not 100% on him being able to read them from somewhere outside your phone. He could be sneaking into your room and taking your phone or maybe he has outside sources doing it.

pDcJGptPaa	Every single time I have bought a "refurb", it has failed within the warranty period, EVERY TIME. I still had to provide all the documentation, pay for shipping , and then wait for it to be repaired. Every time I have bought factory new, I have never had a failed piece of equipment. NEVER . The problem with consumer electronics is that, unless you buy new, you have no way of knowing any history of the item whatsoever. I would buy used gear before I would buy refurbished, because you just don't know what that means. It could have been dropped in a bucket of water, for all you know.|`|IvkZNs0caa	As long as the camera is refurbished by the manufacturer and will have a standard "new" warranty it is an excellent deal.  Refurbished equipment usually has a 100% quality inspection by a single technician.  This is actually better than the standard factory quality inspection.<br>  <br>  Refurbished usually means that the camera was returned because it was used as a demonstration model or was purchased and returned for some reason such as a manufacturing defect, product upgrade/exchange or similar circumstance.  If a defect was the reason for the return a reputable camera company such as Nikon will make every effort to fully correct the problem and verify that it exceeds the minimum specification for the function.<br>  <br>  HTH.  Good luck!|`|14512ce63e83e4e4a2a4411804cb548faa	In my opinion, I would get the brand new one. Refurbished means that the camera probably had something wrong with it and that's why the person that had it before returned it|`|S253XERKaa	if you can save $250.00 and your getting a warranty why not sound like a good deal to me|`|i5OVORXgaa	Go ahead and get it... the $250 that you save can be used towards something else, like a new lens or external flash!<br>  <br>  Just because it's refurbished doesn't mean that something was wrong with it so it was returned... they could have upgraded.

Trust me its great.|`|2nXrQhkeaa	limewire!<br>  Or sites like mp3-fusion.net<br>  :)|`|77UaGGsLaa	I think the only way to get free music is to download it illegally. Before I started buying from iTunes I used to just get music from CDs and from friends.  <br>  If you ever decide you want to pay for your music but not buy from iTunes, you could go to limewire.com and pay a fee of something like $10 a month to get as much music as you want, but I know limewire has a reputation of screwing up people's computers.

The only way they cost is if you dont have unlimited!!<br>  <br>  You could record a sound-depending on what phone you have- & can have that sound as your ringtone!  <br>  <br>  0R <br>  <br>  You can send the sound to your friend/someone and have them forward it to you & you can save it!|`|DtQBLOmzaa	I wish.... :P<br>  <br>  Yes, they indeed do, it's as simple as making them with some editing software. It's actually not that hard, depending on the phone/computer you have. Some software, however might cost you. Besides that, ring tones can be different file types. When you find the file type your ring tones are on your phone, you could just Google that. Ring tones are not really called ring tones all the time, but those who are not labeled as ring tones and sold are usually not that good. TIP: don't trust free ring tones if it says "free ring tones" or anything. I once had a "free ring tone" but it turned out I was charged 10 bucks for one ring tone....<br>  <br>  itunes has ringtones for 99cents...<br>  Phonezoo, as I heard, will give you free ringtones, but that is if you have an unlimited plan with your service provider (i.e at&t, verizon, sprint)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|GddvhUnMaa	Sure!!!!!<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.createringtones.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.createringtones.net</a><br>  <br>  its definately the best site for ringtone creations.

ncCWnApDaa	In my opinion it would be DS, it has the games tons of them, of every genre and its games aren't just ports, there are tons of games made specifically with the DS in mind, just look at the brain training games or Phantom Hourglass, they all belong on a handheld system, the problem with PSP is most of the games I played on it where better on PS2, its multi media doesn't interest me, ipod does that much better anyway, and its games I'm interested in and the DS has tons of top quality games in development like Dragon Quest 9, Mario & Luigi RPG 3 and Echoes of Time, while all the PSP seems to be getting is another port in Little Big Planet, I'm sure it will turn out fine but it really needs some brand new content, I mean the DS has brought us the Brain Training type games and various other content actually created on DS, while the PSP hasn't really created many new game franchises at all, it has more ports than even the wii, not that all ports are bad but in the PSP's case they do seem inferior to their console counterparts.|`|6JWdKaWbaa	The DSi because you can go on the internet,put in a sd card,take pictures and listen to music. But they are taking the game boy slots away in the DSi. And I think the DSi has an anti-glare screen.|`|dde6fe2179e353e51a4888e29baa2dd3aa	OK PSP (cuz the DSi is nowhere near graphics, portability, accesories etc...). The PSP has internet in Wi-fi hotspots where you can use AIM. On the interstate, those are rest areas. PSP's have video players, mp3 players built in. Pictures, etc... The only thing bad, memory sticks. Not really expensive, but still a bad thing. The DSi does not have anything. No wi-fi, no video, pictures, mp3. It's a piece of crap. I wouldn't buy it for anything against the PSP.|`|m2BCAdD3aa	DS is fun!!! YAY DS DS D double screen FEEL THE POWER OF DUALITY BITCHESSSS|`|DMitgoGaaa	DSi, Cause You can take Pictures, go on the internet for free And  you can hear music while your playing a game.|`|keraHxxoaa	I prefer the PSP because of the features and the PSN community, also maybe the games for the psp.|`|h4WxwcOsaa	Even though I prefer the PSP, you would probably want a DSi. The DSi can now look at photos, play music, videos, has 2 (!) cameras so you can take pictures, and has an online store where you can buy games and download demos. The games would be really fun for girls, they have games like Nintendogs (where you groom and take care of a virtual dog), and it has Pictochat, which is kind of like AIM, accept you have to be within a certain distance of your friends and they have to have a DS too.
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Well, you can't have a cable modem with no cable access, so eventually they will figure it out.|`|eg1TaKZdaa	If you tricked them into it then they may eventually find out and I am not exactly sure what they will do. If it was their mistake then they would be mad if they found out but they would charge you the right amount. You wouldn't have to face criminal charges.

QuVrqKxOaa	call your cell company and ask them, or just go there, show them the phone and ask them your qestion.
DtQBLOmzaa	Yes, that is the age when most children get their cellphones. Everyone in middle school has cell phones, and people sometimes NEED them when your in middle school. It usually does not ruin a child, especially one who is mature and responsible. Besides a computer it's much more likely to do stuff like that then a cellphone. Maybe start with a limited plan. You see she does fine(which I'm sure she will), give her more of the plan. If she starts decreasing in grades, limit her, maybe take away her phone. Don't worry - it will be fine!|`|XhirXRkpaa	My fiance and I bought his daughter one when she was ten.  We like being able to get a hold of her when we need to.  It also helps us keep track of her.  You just need to make sure you lay the ground rules in the beginning and stick to them. If you only want her sending so many text messages a day, then she needs to respect that rule; otherwise, she loses phone privileges.  My fiance's step daughter has been great with hers, but she did drop her first one in a bucket of water.  You may want to consider investing in the insurance plan.|`|3UN8jBrbaa	Only for special occasions, such as birthday parties or sporting events. Don't give her one for all the time.

URpSHVF9aa	well the cheapest right now would be a used one from gamestop or ebay<br>  <br>  a new one would cost $400 in any store<br>  <br>  but wait until april and may<br>  supposaly, there are rumors going on that the ps3 is going to drop down to $299 in between these 2 months|`|AA11610592	I would think the cheapest is the 80GB PS3 without any bundled pack. It would be $399, comes with a controller, USB cord to charge your Controller, and A/V plugs, and the console. It would be nice to get a game out of it, but if you can't get the 60 bucks for a game, I suggest getting a 20 dollar PSN card to put cash on the PSN account and download games from the PlayStation Store.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the new 80GB and 160GB PS3 models contain 2 USB ports, No Backwards Compatibility with PS2 games, it lets you play some PS1 games but that's about it. It also doesn't have any kind of Media ports like SD cards or other media cards on the front top of the console.|`|r2tdDVVjaa	40 gig|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	A broken one.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The cheapest would be a used 20 gb PS3.

They mainly provide land phone service and DSL Internet service. They also offer a VOIP plan to provide phone service to Internet-only customers, plus DirectTV satellite TV and Verizon cell phones to pad out their product line.
0AqkCOWIaa	I do not think that they sell the D40 with an 18-55mm VR lens. In reality, you do not need Vibration Reduction. You are a lot less likely to run into 1/55 of a second or below than you are say 1/300 of a second. This is a very short focal lengthed lens, you do not need VR. Get this kit lens, and when you get a telephoto lens make you sure you get it then. Image Stabilization is a nifty feature, but is definitely just a want, and not a need with the 18-55mm lens.|`|i5OVORXgaa	They don't sell the D40 with a VR lens... if you want a VR lens then buy the body and lens seperately... or buy the D60 (it comes with a VR lens).

They just don't want to be bothered by spending money to upgrade your line, but guess what?<br>  <br>  They are a public utility, and are supposed to provide service for all. Look in your phone book, find the number for the Public Service Commissioner. It will likely be in the state govt. listings. <br>  <br>  There will be a nice secretary there that will contact Iowa Telecom and most likely get them off their dead butt. It worked great for me twice when I had trouble with the power company dragging their dead butt.<br>  <br>  The Public Service Commissioner regulates them, and seems to take pride in making them do their job servicing the community.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The XSi (450D) is a very nice camera overall, with excellent image quality, features and performance, and also appears to handle ISO 800 and 1600 better than the A350.<br>  <br>  These higher ISOs are necessary if you especially want to shoot in lower light or indoors, without flash. You will also want a fast lens (one with an aperture of f/2.8 or wider).<br>  <br>  The IS kit lens is a great starter lens, but you will most likely want a better one in future. And, if you want to shoot in lower light you will also need a faster lens. I suggest a prime lens (EF 50mm f/1.8-an absolute bargain at less than US$90, EF50mm f/1.4, EF85mm f/1.8 etc).<br>  <br>  When choosing a telephoto lens, don't go for the cheapest if you want the sharpest possible image quality.<br>  <br>  Use the 'Creative Zone' modes, rather than the "Basic Zone' modes. Aperture Priority (Av) is a good place to start...and practice using different apertures and ISOs, etc.<br>  <br>  Use the centre auto focus point if you are having issues with focus. I use this most of the time, because I know exactly where the camera will focus. It can be selected while in the 'Creative Zone' modes.<br>  <br>  Shooting in RAW+Jpeg is a good idea. File sizes are approx. 20mb each, though. RAW files need to be converted using software, but they're a non lossy file format and give you far more flexibility in post-processing, whereas jpegs are a lossy file format, but provide instant usabilty. <br>  <br>  You will want a fast memory card for fast continuous shooting, fast write speeds and fast transferral of files via USB card reader. Sandisk Extreme III SD or SDHC is excellent.<br>  <br>  p.s. read the manual.<br>  <br>  good luck...from a satisfied 450D (XSi) user|`|3uD1Ncubaa	Canon EOS Rebel Xsi all the way!!!<br>  <br>  I'm really into photography and I have a Canon EOS Rebel 100 and I LOVE it  it takes great pictures.<br>  <br>  I'd say the top best camera companies are Cannon, Olympus, & Nikon.

You have a Canon and like it, so stick with it and save yourself some money on lenses and accessories. The two cameras are so similar performance-wise that it doesn't justify a switch.|`|i5OVORXgaa	No, it's not all about the megapixels... the Canon Rebel XSi is a great choice, especially since you already have a 35mm Canon... you can continue using your current lenses!|`|pDcJGptPaa	The difference between 12 and 14 mp is negligible unless you are going to print poster sized images, and even then, the 2 mega pixels won't make much of a difference. Go for the Canon, since you already have one. They are easier to customize than the Sony, too. Mix and match with lenses, flashes and accessories way easier and more readily available than the Sony Line. Plus you may even be able to use some of your existing canon equipment (including the lens). Most any lens for the EOS line will still work with today's gear.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Both are excellent camera and take pretty images quality, choose the one that right in your hand is the best.<br>  Canon Rebel XSi<br>  Pro :<br>  it's a solid camera.

And you are already used to the Canon set-up so..?<br>  <br>  The A350 does live view better than anybody else at the moment, and it has a better LCD, and it tilts. It is stabilized unlike Canon, so every lens is anti-shake.<br>  <br>  But it's a slow-ish shooter, because the 14MP file I believe.<br>  <br>  The canon is cleaner at high ISO, and there's more of everything available for the Canon. Both are solid cameras.<br>  <br>  As for the megapixels, they both have too many. That's right I said too many. As you increase the pixel count, noise gets worse. MP are pushed because people believe more is better, so it sells. I think they should have stopped at 10 with APS-C sensors in all the brands, well that's my two cents anyway.<br>  <br>  I'm waiting to see what Sony does with the A700 replacement, I'm hoping they don't pull a Canon 50d and deliver more pixels that I don't really want.<br>  <br>  If you have any kind of investment in Canon, I say stick with it. It can cost a lot to sell all your glass and other extras to change over.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	If you check out the  A590IS, you may find that it is better to get a less expensive camera that does more.  $99.00 !

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one place to get great buys, but click the second link in the information above then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices.

Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.

Generally, in my opinion, I recommend the SD1100 if you want something slim, stylish, and more portable. I recommend the 590IS if you want a wider multiplicity of capabilities, and because it is under $100 (seriously, its a good deal!). Because of your need of a point and shoot camera, I do not think that you need the capabilities of the Powershot series cameras such as manual exposure time (wait, you can do that in CHDK in the SD1100!)... so, for you, I definitely recommend a SD1100 for your needs. Also, getting a more expensive camera than that is most likely not a good idea because they are most likely going to come with unnecessary features which you will never use, and are most likely overpriced (The point/shoot cameras are in the $150 range).|`|wTmFb2T8aa	Canon SD790has the best photo quality in its class! it's great and really cheep now ($135-$160 the last time i checked). I have one and i love it!<br>  <br>  the canon SD880 is about the same, little more expensive, and not as great photo quality but every1 says its a great camera.<br>  <br>  Check canon's new line of cameras. I haven't checked them yet but most of them have 12MP cameras and are really good (i hear) and can record video in 720p (HD). but they are quite expensive compared to the canon sd790 because the 790 is last years model but is still amazing!<br>  (the new ones go to $229 [the 10 MP SD1200 with no HD vid recording] to up to $380 [the 12.1 MP SD970 with HD] and the almost $400 [the 14 MP last years model SD990)|`|YmcURwDAaa	Not really. CHDK lets you do some utterly insane things, but they don't get *more* insane as you move up the PowerShot ladder. It's really the great equalizer among Canon point-and-shoots. If I were you, I'd pick up the cheapest one that's got a compatible CHDK patch and pocket the difference.
njTdZQm9aa	When you're in camera mode just use the +/- buttons on the side to adjust the zoom, I just got the neon pink a couple days ago... but I love it!|`|uKWU94BZaa	Walk closer to whatever your taking a picture of!!!! JKS!!!  Sorry :P N e ways on to your question i thinnk that you use the same button that is dedicated to volume on the same side on the picture button! If not then i would look at a LG Neon review on Youtube they tell you the main things you need to know, if that doesn't work out you can always look in THE MANUAL that the phone comes with lol sorry for getting old fashoined on you! :P :P :P

AbRfd29Haa	Lomos have never been about high quality -- they do what they do. They're supposed to be for fun, for the idea of always having a camera with you, that kind of stuff. <br>  <br>  With that said, there are some things to check. Grain is never the camera's fault, for a film camera, it's entirely the fault of the film and/or processing. Check your ISO numbers.. a higher ISO is grainier, a lower ISO less so. <br>  <br>  A brown tint could be the lens, but I also very much doubt that... that's probably the processing you got on the film and/or prints, if it's not an aspect of the film itself. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're getting film that hasn't expired, and has been stored correctly. In these days, it's quite likely that some stores keep their film on the shelf for months at a time, maybe under bad temperature conditions as well. You might try mail order from a place that caters to pros, like <a href="http://www.bhphoto.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphoto.com.</a>  It could also be the processing.. use a company that does lots of chemical photo business still.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	A 60 dollar film camera? Peronally I think it would be better to pay 50 more dollars and get a cheap digital camera from Canon, Panasonic or other such brands<br>  <br>  But if you want a film camera, I suggest you get a different brand film camera since that one appears to be pretty crappy|`|l1dAq3pOaa	Don't quite remember about the brownish tinge--maybe trouble with developing. It's been years since I did any of it. The grainyness is caused from the wrong film speed. The higher the film speed the more grainy (600-1500)  The slower film speed like 200 usually has very little grain.|`|AA12323486	Lomography cameras are supposed to make poor quality images.  That's the trend.  It's an overpriced toy.  Enjoy its quirkiness, or sell it to a friend and buy a good camera.<br>  <br>  The off-color shouldn't be from the camera.  Is it color or black and white film?  The newer black and white film is actually a color film, and often has a color cast in processing.  It just means the lab's color is a little off.  That's actually quite common.  Whether it was color or black and white, take the film (negatives and prints) back to the lab and ask them to re-do it.  You shouldn't have to accept a bad lab job.  If they want you to come back again, they will listen to you.  If not, see if you can find another lab.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	I am told that those cameras have poor lenses. You should have spent  $20 to $30 more and bought the cheapest Canon.
