20090131092650AADc4Ce	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please read my poem. I need some honest opinions.?	I’m that girl sitting in her room for so long,   Waiting to hear that special song.   She finally hears it, but she’s too late.   She closed her heart and he closed the gate.      I’m that girl, who imagines herself in his arms,   Because hers is the heart that he harms.   But she cannot resist.   Does love really exist?      I’m that girl with so much passion,   I make it seem like the new fashion.   But maybe I am just a fool.   My head and heart fight in a duel.      Every day and every night,   I wonder if my head is right.   “You’re being stupid” my mind reads.   “Just be patient.” My heart bleeds.      I’m that girl sitting on her bed,   Remembering when her chances weren’t dead.   And living in the happy past,   Trying too hard to make it last.

"American Pie"      No longer, leaping out   of ticker tape high windows, is allowed,   and here and now I come to ponder   on the use to be.      "the grapes of wrath"   upon the vine are squashed,   their juices dry, take arid toll   on earth and "all american" families   on "razors edge" of dark despair,   some act upon misinterpretation's      of golden words, "Give me liberty or give me death"   the gun in hand; is not aimed on battle's shore,   Alas, it is aimed and fired; at their very own   within a home, of loved ones dear, in false sacrifice   or other innocents, they chance to meet,   our nation free, observes in shocking wonder,      of who will be the next to fall into the trap of fear   that they shall, be cast out upon   "the street of broken dreams",   as sung in days of olden songs   ring out their timeless true refrain, "ain't we got fun",   and of the pie that's slivered to a pulp,   the fruit's tempting aroma and savored flavor linger.      So;   yet and still the universal orbs   scream out to slice another wedge of pulp,   for untamed evil's sweets.            (and what of turnips and beets)

Must I go through life   Always being dissed?    When they only see the perfection  Not what's really inside  They don't understand  I break down and cry    My heart is a war  Raging- still going strong  But the way that I feel  Is it really so wrong?    I should say not!  Everyone has those days  But the sadness in me,   Always there, never fading away    I can laugh, I can joke  Try and cover it up  But behind all the smiles, my heart is torn up    Taller than the rest  Always up in a daze  Although I may have pain  Everything just might be okay    Please be honest! Thanks!

The film "300" is about the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans fought against ONE MILLION Persians.   Frankly, I couldn't believe the military manpower of each side.   Even though the 300 Spartans were very well trained like the members of Delta Force or Navy Seal, would it have been possible for them to defend 1,000,000 (ordinary) Persians for several days?   And what about the elephants and rhinos in the battle, apart from the fictional appearance of the Persians that bring up the image of the film "Lord of the Ring"?

20090131092013AAQ2Ytu	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Read a poem I wrote last night?	An empty seat for a man   Who doesn't ever come   No one ever notices   That it sits all alone.      The hall is long and quiet   Not a sound he makes   A trip from room to room   His precious time he takes.      The lecture lingers long and hard   A trouble to the mind   His curious incentives   Are not too hard to find.      The speaker soon has   No more to say   His mouth is dry   His thoughts astray.      A puzzling picture   This lecture hall is   All the seats are filled   All except for his.      As you walk down the hall   Look to your left   You'll find the man that never came   Asking God why he is deaf.          Kind of a bad ending, I know. But I just want to hear your opinions. (:
20090131092404AADZGmA	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think the author is trying to say in this medieval poem ?	Woman should gather roses ere   Time's ceaseless foot o'ertaketh her,   For if too long she make delay,   Her chance of love may pass away,   And well it is she seek it while   Health, strength, and youth around her smile.   To pluck the fruits of love in youth   Is each wise woman's rule forsooth,   For when age creepeth o'er us, hence   Co also the sweet joys of sense,   And ill doth she her days employ   Who lets life pass without love's joy.   And if my counsel she.despise,   Not knowing how 'tis just and wise,   Too late, alas! will she repent   When age is come, and beauty spent.
20090131095508AAoVGNM	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Why don't people want to go through good training to become good actors?	Meaning, why do people (most people) just go from high school and start trying to ecome actors. Or get training that is, well, not pointless, just without any real results. I mean, I hear that Lee Strasberg Institute is just amazing, but rarely do people probably even think of going there. Yes, it's costly, but probably just like any other universiy in USA. I mean, agents must want actors with training like this more than actors with one high school play experience, no?

20080711171359AAkeFZn	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Is Ballet the Right for Me?	I have a problem with choosing hobbies.  I'll try something and then I'll find that I don't enjoy it.  So I actually have no lessons I take or anything.  All I do is draw, read, write, and I'm in a choir.  Lately I've been trying to find an active hobby that I can stick to.  I don't like soccer, softball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf, hockey, and generally any other sport you can name.  However,(out of nowhere) I recently started thinking about ballet.  It's so beautiful.  Ballet is in my family history, and my mom told me that I would be good at it (she says I'm graceful and that I have a runner's legs which is helpful in ballet).  I realize that it can be painful and takes a lot of discipline, but I know I can handle that.  I just don't know if it's something I want to do.  Then again, I'll never know if I don't try.  So, what's it like to do ballet?  Should I try it?  Also, I'm 13, and people say it harder to start late.

20070103144248AATieSS	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Thoughts about negitivity/self esteem/self worth etc.......?	Negitivity      Why is it that I always go into the negitive? Why is it that I blame myself for things which are beyond my control? Why is it that I love people who are not worthy of my love? My heart seems so open so caring and yet the people I allow in are the wrong ones. The reason that this negitivity is in my life is because I allow this negitivity to control me. The world around me tends to mold me, so if I surround myself with negitivity I become negitive. I am a flower in the woods, a beautiful flower, and in order for me to stay beautiful and live I must have the soil for my roots to grow in; the sunlight to feed me; and the rain to quench my thirst, if I do not allow this into my life then I die, if I do I possibly live and possibly grow stronger. I have to allow so much inside me to live emotionally. I need to cautiously allow love into my life as well as give love, but not to the point that I give to much; a nice balance in life. I cannot let the tree next to me take all the water, I must have water myself. When you realize that someone is not appreciative of your love, you must stop, make sure that you take care of your needs, and if you must do this, you may have to let them go and take that piece of your heart. You will always have your memories to look on, and it is a piece of your past, a learning tool for life. I believe that I cannot fear changes as I do. It is stopping me from getting my water, sunlight, and soil to live. Keeping me from experiencing life. Keeps me from living the way life was meant to be savored. A friend of mine says, "If we resist life are we resisting death? If we resist death are we also resisting life?", something to ponder at least. Some of us say we do not fear death, but yet we fear living our life? Some people do not fear life but fear death, seems we all contradict ourselves with fear of emotions or fear of truly expressing ourselves. It seems to just be a big circle of emotions for me and I have been running and running in the circle. It's like a friend said once, he was on hold, circling and circling the airport, waiting for a place to land, but I am tired of holding in the sky, I am the only one to land this plane. I am the pilot of my life it is about time I take control and land.

I have fallen,deep down inside  There is no where else  to hide.    All my cheer has come to sorrow.  I hope to not lie here,by tomorrow.    I hope for dread to fly away  and never come back,one day.    I wait and wait for one to come,  who will not fight  or want to run.    My thoughts flow freely,  as I start to let go.  My feelings shatter,long gone.    I am awakening new  and reborn.  I begin to feel like and free of worry.    ..it turns out  this is the end  of my story    I lie in a sleep,which I will never  awaken,I just lie there,dead  and unshaken.    My body tears and I cry.  There is no more need  to feel empty inside.    All that I loved has been buried and covered,  only to be discovered someday.    I wait so impatient for this day to come.  So that it will be time for me  to run.    Far away into a world with no hatred  and hurt.    Far away just to cry and cry.

20090131131601AAmlBv3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my story too wordy..yes or no?	think she put on weight. I thought as I stared at the teacher. Her words had yet to register in my mind. My hand itched towards my headphones which were snuggled safe in my pocket. The subject at discussion was sex, the most effective sleep-inducer. But enduring was what I must do. There was only 53 minutes and 9 seconds left of this class. Without an effort, I slipped into a harmless coma which was shattered when a sudden appearance of a note at my right demanded my attention.      Jerking my head around, I saw who threw it.      Blanching was my first response. Composing myself, my second response morphed into an indiscernible expression of indifference. I neither glared nor smiled. In my internal conflict, he seemed to have found something amusing. His eyes were devoid of shame, expressing a keen interest in the book that was me. The reserved look he managed to acquire belied his failure. Glancing down at the note, I didn’t know which was more embarrassing. My pulsing heart or my smarting face. The note said nothing different from what he had been pestering me for.                                talk?      The terse nature of his note added another mount of tension to our already strained relationship. With the note, there was also a challenge. Without giving him a glance, I wrote down my reply. I was proud to say that I managed to make my response shorter.                                  No      Thinking the matters closed, I returned to my previous state of listlessness. But alas, this was not my day. Another note landed, perfectly in front of me. Letting off a sigh of impatience, I glanced at him, intent on giving him my meanest glare. My intention leaked away momentarily as I did nothing but gazed at the smirk he had on. It was The smirk. However insulting it was for me, I was glad for its existence. His smirk grew at my contradictory response. Whatever hold on me he had, for the moment, he let it go. With my thoughts turned into a jumble of incoherence, I hastily looked upon the note.                                  ?      That explains the smirk. He had managed to write something most terse. This battle of terseness that just took place proved just how dangerous he was to me. He knew me. He didn't bother with the pesky image that I put forth of me but he chose to take into account more my thoughts than my speech. He could steal my person, absorbing every miniscule thoughts I had. It was foolhardy of me to say I wasn't scared.      The fear aside, an anticipation of some sort was planted in my mind. I watched myself write down what would be my last defense.                                        Ok         It was my silent surrender as the note went flying through the air, landing softly on his notebook. My loss was also my gain because I could stare at him much as I wished. My eyes turned to that of a stealthy wolf, hunting for his response. though he owned the most expressive of eyes and face, the exact skill with how he, at will, could veil his feelings was baffling. I would have taken him to be made out of stone had I not known him. Right then, he looked up and beamed. I could do nothing but nod.      Minutes before, I was restless to get out of this class, desperate for fresh air. Now, I wished for the complete opposite. Sitting in the seat forever seemed rather amenable compared to talking to him. Since I was too occupied with my frazzled thoughts, I didn’t notice the hour coming to an end. So when the bell sounded its harsh trill, I gave a start. I exited the class, not an ounce smarter than before entering the class.      As expected he stood leaning against my locker. I approached him with wary steps.      Lets get this over with, I challenged myself.         When I reached him, I said with much businesslike voice as possible. “Talk”      “Impatience becomes you.” he said with a laugh.   Shaking his head, he proposed talking outside. “ I thought you might want some fresh air.” He slyly added.      I walked ahead intent on getting this ordeal over as fast as I possibly could. I opened the exit door.   “ Whoa, careful there. I don’t think our school can afford a new door.”      I waited for him to start

Ever followed a    butterfly's erratic flight?   Or gazed at the sun into the fading    night?   You better slow down.    Don't dance so    fast.    Time is short.   The music won't    last.   Do you run through each day   On the fly?   When you ask How are you?   Do you hear the    reply?   When the day is done,    Do you lie in your    bed   With the next hundred chores   Running through    your head?   You better slow down.   Don't dance so     fast.   Time is short.   The music won't    last.    Ever told your child,   We'll do it    tomorrow?   And in your haste,   Not see    his     sorrow?   Ever lost touch,   Let a good    friendship die   Cause you never had time   To call    and say, 'Hi.'   You better slow down.   Don't dance    so fast.   Time is short.    The music won't    last.   When you run so fast to get somewhere   You    miss half the fun of getting there.    When you worry and hurry    through your day,   It is like an unopened    gift ...    Thrown away.   Life is not a    race.   Do take it slower   Hear the    music....   Before the song is over.          I got this poem in a e-mail. A young girl in New York City, fighting for cancer wrote this.

Some would argue that we do things for others in order to feel good about ourselves or subconsciously in order to have people who could do us a favour in return.      So does Altruism really exist?    Are we always subconciously trying to gain something from goodwill to others?      Is our biological Darwinian drive too powerful to truly allow altruism?

Start with what you feel   Feel about our part   Part of all our problems   Problems I denied   Denied the chance to heal   Heal away our scars   Scars which now will stay   Stay inside my mind   Mind you, I have learned   Learned from all my faults    Faults which led to crying   Crying we did, non-stop               Stop               Stop   Stop this cycle    We have got to start   Start a whole new life   Life away from lies               Lies              Lies  Lies consumed our lives    Now I feel so trapped  Trapped inside this cage  Cage all of my sorrow  Sorrow turns to rage    Honey, Im so sorry   Sorry it came to this    This has got to stop  Stop with all your yapping   Yapping turned me deaf  Deaf from all your stories  Stories have brought this end   End all of the lies   Honey Im so sorry  Honey now were dead     When i said dead i meant the death of a relationship just to clear that up, what do you think?
20090131125821AA2VsaG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	End of Breaking Dawn?	Is it just me that thinks that Alice coming in and sorting out the whole fight at the end is a real anti-climax, and ruins the books.      I think that they should have the fight (and win) because Alice found an army of something, anything. Then to make it really seem worthwhile and realistic, some people should have died e.g. Zafrina, Vladimir and (though i hate to say it) Emmett.       Also, don't you think it just sounds supid when Edward says 'I fervently agree'?

20090131122813AAQd3kO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What are your thoughts on this poem i wrote?? =]?	i know its not much. i wrote it kinda quick.      comments are greatly appriciated :)            Lost in a vast world of confusion.   Suddenly things start to seem as just an illusion.   Can’t seem to figure out what’s true from what’s a lie.   And in the end everything seems to go awry.   Never knowing which decisions to make.   Worrying that what you choose will only make your heart ache.   Or that what you choose just won’t make a difference.   And you just can’t seem to find a balance.   You find yourself always hiding from something.   Because your afraid of the pain that it may bring.   You’re afraid of the truth and what you’re really feeling.   You wonder if your hearts worth healing.   There are things you just can’t seem to figure out.   Those are the things that fill you up with doubt.   Your always so blinded by what you fear,   That nothing ever seems clear.   You soon lose sight in what is right in front of you,   But those are the things you thought you never knew.   You try to find hope and gain a sense of trust.   But that is like trying to get rid of rust,   Difficult but not impossible.   And then you’re finding yourself more fragile.   The weight of the world has finally taken its hold.   And at that moment you decide you are done being fooled.   You know now that not everything in life is going to be comprehensible.   And sometimes you’re going to have to be careful.   You trust carefully that no one tries to get the best of you.   But if they do, you only hope there’s some one who will come to your rescue.   You then realize the confusion never really goes away.   And most of all that no matter what, everyday is a new day.

20090131114723AAhrZEF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poe's The Conqueror Worm?	So, for my speech class, I have to memorize Poe's poem the Conqueror Worm, and then talk about what we think it means. How would you interpret this poem?      Lo! 'tis a gala night   Within the lonesome latter years!   An angel throng, bewinged, bedight   In veils, and drowned in tears,   Sit in a theatre, to see   A play of hopes and fears,   While the orchestra breathes fitfully   The music of the spheres.      Mimes, in the form of God on high,   Mutter and mumble low,   And hither and thither fly-   Mere puppets they, who come and go   At bidding of vast formless things   That shift the scenery to and fro,   Flapping from out their Condor wings   Invisible Woe!      That motley drama- oh, be sure   It shall not be forgot!   With its Phantom chased for evermore,   By a crowd that seize it not,   Through a circle that ever returneth in   To the self-same spot,   And much of Madness, and more of Sin,   And Horror the soul of the plot.      But see, amid the mimic rout   A crawling shape intrude!   A blood-red thing that writhes from out   The scenic solitude!   It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs   The mimes become its food,   And seraphs sob at vermin fangs   In human gore imbued.      Out- out are the lights- out all!   And, over each quivering form,   The curtain, a funeral pall,   Comes down with the rush of a storm,   While the angels, all pallid and wan,   Uprising, unveiling, affirm   That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"   And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

20090131131235AAhbIVs	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	FREE-WILL..does it really exist..help me understand OTHERWISE?	I think the idea of free-will & have given it a lot of thought- I think that it doesn't really exist ...i want you to help me understand otherwise if true.   Here's what i think:   We are limited beings who live according to limited conditions...      Every choice that you believe that you are freely taking is just an illusion that you want your mind to believe. The fact that you decide to listen to this romantic song & not a rock song is because of events & past & current experiences that make your present mood the way it is now which leads you to listen to a romantic song...you do not choose to....         I am posting this question here because of curiosity..curiosity that God embedded in us..i am helpless..i cannot fight the fact that this issue is bugging me deeply & i don't think i can put a meaning to life without an explanation to it....      The only way i can think of free-will is if God really exists and the only condition which enables you to freely choose is to either choose God ,if he truly exists, or to continue being brainwashed by this world's fake and shitty values and morals....the concept of free-will is made-up...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....      so tell me what you think...true?...or help me understand otherwise..thank you

20090131121614AAs6TUN	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	How can I stop looking like an idiot when I dance?	I'm in my school's show choir and I'm pretty much the only one who can't dance. I was having a pretty okay time with it when our choreographer taught us the first dance in this medley, but the one we learned friday afternoon was so hard for me I was pretty much crying the whole time. I couldn't get past how stupid I looked compared to everyone else and and I kept messing things up because I was always falling behind. I stayed after and the choreographer helped me a little, so I can do the moves if I really concentrate but I look stupid and off balance the whole time. I can't seem to do the spins without either falling over, facing the wrong way, or getting off on the wrong foot, unless I'm staring at my feet. And another move which involves jumping to the side with my legs crossed and shimmying my shoulders just makes me look like a complete idiot, but everyone else seems to be able to do it.    Please don't give me the "have fun with it" or "get more confident" answers, because I can't be confident if I look like ****. I don't know, maybe it's just my body shape, but compared to all nine other girls in our group, I look like I can barely walk let alone dance.    I don't care so much about looking good myself, I just don't want to make the rest of the group look bad because I can't keep up.

When you're a shadow, life's a bore   You always hope for something more    Like a puppet, you cannot move   You've lost ability to choose      So what is it that you live for?   When you're a shadow, life's a bore   A world which no one understands    Your lifestyle is what they command      In their footsteps, you trail behind   You've got you heart, they took your mind   When you're a shadow, life's a bore   You won't be ignored anymore      Break the pattern that they follow   Control today and tomorrow   And because your life should be yours   When you're a shadow, life's a bore

All right I dont exactly know when or how, but I lost my school library book, its called gathering blue by Louis Lowry. I already owe .10 cents and it doubles every week I dont have it. Since Ive looked EVERYWHERE and checked with all my teachers who said they havent seen it, I decided I might as well buy a copy. For .95 on a site called textbooksRus.com I can get a used copy in very good condition (I figure she wont know the difference between used and new.And if she does Ill tell her it ripped or something.The copy that I got was in horrible condition already.). But will my librarien let me just give her the newer copy or will I HAVE to give her like $8 so she can buy the most expensive copy she sees.

20090131120309AAdGHAb	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Methods of encrypting my journal?	I want to keep a personal log of my ideas, and major experiences as days go by. I realized that my memory is quite horrific and it would really be helpful to me. It would also be a nice way of looking back at my life as time passes. I'm not sure how dedicated to it I'll become, but I'll attempt it.      The thing is, my parents can be really snoopy when they come into my room. They would just go and read it if they knew I kept one, and the way my house is, it is pretty impossible to effectively hide it from them. I am considering encrypting it and have researched a small bit on how to do this.   I was considering rearranging the alphabet, then reverse numbering it, multiplying by a number, and use the resulting numbers as letters. However, this is merely just a numeric version of substitution ciphering (I think :S) and one could easily analyze the frequency of numbers in order to determine their corresponding letter. In fact, more or less every substitution method is open to this kind of analysis.      Now, my parents are some annoyingly clever people, and I'm paranoid that they may attempt to break the code.

Let me not to the marriage of true minds   Admit impediments. Love is not love   Which alters when it alteration finds,   Or bends with the remover to remove:      O no! it is an ever-fixed mark   That looks on tempests and is never shaken;   It is the star to every wand'ring bark,   Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.      Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks   Within his bending sickle's compass come;   Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,   But bears it out even to the edge of doom:      If this be error and upon me proved,   I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

I'm slowly learning how to use it, but I have some questions that are not really answered in the manual.  I shot my first roll of film, and most of it was blurry, which I later realized was because I was using the 1 second shutter speed without a tripod.  Many of them were overexposed though.  I understand the connection between shutter speed and exposure, but how do I determine what shutter speed to use and when?  For example, if I'm indoors where the light is somewhat low and I'm not using flash or anything, should I use 1s shutter speed with a tripod?  And my main question, because it is winter and there's a lot of snow/bright light, what shutter speed should I use for photographing the snow/outdoor things in this weather?

Making out in the stalls I guess.” Kyle said.    “Shut up, Kyle!” Isobele and Vince said at the same time. ‘Nobody was going to say that Isobele’s boyfriend was making out in the stalls with Vince Leroaqu’s girlfriend, June Westing.’ Isobele thought.     “Ok, ok, settle down you guys.” Kyle said. “It’s like you know something we don’t,” Kyle jabbed Vince’s shoulder with his fist. Vince punched him back in the shoulder. The bell rang…Finally, thought Isobele.     Kyle and Matt headed to health class, while Isobele went to Home Ec. with Terra and Mackenzie. Gosh, she hated them. They were like little satellites and she was big fat moon. Had she gained weight? Another night of purging, she thought. Then, Vince headed to Math class where he was supposed to meet up with Trevor. But Trevor didn’t show up. (?!?!?!?!)       “Sorry I’m late.” Trevor said as he walked in the math room. Mrs. Lewinsky gave him a glare. He sat down and winked at the teacher as he did. He knew that all it took to get his B in math class was a charming attitude to the teacher and he certainly and plenty of that. His blue eyes and brown moppy hair was the perfect fit for the popular guy at school. He had it all: the looks, the humor, the athletic body, and a charm.        The door to room 401 opened slowly, loudly and the figure in the door way entered gracefully. It was June Westing.      “Westing, late again I see.” Mr. Tanner muttered as he went through his papers waving a free hand at her to sit down. ‘Thank god,’ June thought as she sat next to Ashley Millerman.    “What did I miss?” She asked the math wiz.    “Oh, umm nothing just going over standard deviations. You now taking the x amount and then dividing it by the ∑…” at that moment June spaced off. She didn’t have the slightest idea what Ashley was blabbering about. She should have asked Daniel Upturner, sitting next to her.     So while Ashley blabbered on she leaned to her right, which was uncomfortable since, the desk to her seat was right there.     “Hey, Dan? What did I miss?” June asked.    “Oh, nothing just some stuff about a math. You know how math class is.” He winked. Gosh, she hated it when guys did that. Didn’t they know who she was? Who she was dating? Well, in truth she loved the extra attention. Some person said it was bad for the soul, but what did they know? She felt great and she got all the attention she wanted, and more, which was a lot since the attention she wanted was everybody’s. And she got it. Anything she wanted June got.          i know the characters are two dimensional, and i am working on that.
20090131133309AAThdYz	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why is life so mundane?	Now don't get me wrong, I do go out and do things to past the time, thinking these activities will better enrich my life and that I might learn something from those experiences. But after those times are gone I sit at home wondering and reflecting about life and how it can be so routine sometimes. I just don't know the reason behind life -- no goal or purpose. Is it wrong or ungrateful to feel this way?

20090225090529AANLYiO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read the rest of this?	“Alison!” I heard Jessica and Mary shout from outside of my room. I got out of bed and opened the door to see my sisters standing there with a worried expression on their faces. “It’s Jason…” Mary said.    “Yeah, Jason!” Jessica repeated.   “We had a dream, and it doesn’t look so good,” they continued.   By this time I was curious about what was going on.   “Does he get hurt or something?” I asked.   “Not exactly, you see… he’s going to break up with you.”   “What? Why?”   “We don’t know exactly, we think that maybe it has something to do with our family secret…”    “Mary! Jessica! Amy’s here!” we heard from the kitchen. Amy is Jessica and Mary’s best friend who always gives them a ride to school. They hurried down the stairs and left before I could question them further.   I stood there in shock, not comprehending it. I hadn’t told Jason about our family secret, could he somehow have found out?… by this time I realized what must be happening right about now. I raced down the stairs and out of the house.      I raced down 5th avenue and into the coffee shop to find Jason sitting at a table… with the note. The note that Jason was never supposed to find. I wanted to slap myself for being so careless.    “Uh… hey… Jason…” I said with a nervous laugh.   “Would you mind explaining this to me?” he asked. His face was so serious, it wasn’t the kind of look I was used to.   “Oh, uh, that…” I nervously laughed again.   He got up and motioned me to the back of the room, where nobody could hear us.   “How could you keep this from me? I thought we told each other everything?” I felt something warm slide down my cheek, and I quickly realized it was a tear. I stormed out of the coffee shop, knowing what would have happened next. I would have told Jason some lame excuse, such as it being an English project, and then he would remind me that we’re in the same class together. Then he would have said “it’s over,” and I would have ran into the bathroom and cried. I didn’t want to go through that, so I ran. I ran as fast as I could. I didn’t know why, maybe I thought that running would lead me to an escape from my problem, but it didn’t. It only lead me to Michael, my nosiest brother.   “Why the long face?” he asked me in an I’m-only-asking-to-be-nice tone. Melissa, Michael’s girlfriend, came up to him. I walked away, hearing Melissa quietly say something to him. She was probably telling me what had just happened, since she can read my mind. I love Melissa like my own sister, but sometimes her power really gets on my nerves. I kept walking until I was back at the apartment.   “Not going to school today, honey?” my dad asked.    “No, I’m not feeling to well, I think I’m just going to go lie down.” I answered.

20090131140930AAbWxgK	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this? I wrote it all. =)?	Definition of love:   A strong positive emotion of regard and affection.      Most of the worlds definition of love:   SEX. That's it.      MY definition of love:   Realizing that you care so much about this person. They mean so much to you. You'd do absolutely anything for them. And being able to accept having to be with them and only them for the rest of your life. Caring so much about them that you have this pain in your chest that just won't go away.      Like my best friend said, so many people toss around this word as if its meaningless. It's not, people need to realize that.   This word is the most meaningful word in the English dictionary.   People should only ever say it when they truly mean it and can accept having to be with that one person for the rest of their lives if they have to. That's love.      Same with sex; in the olden days people would only have sex if they truly loved someone.Now people will have it with anyone. It's like a sport. People compare the number of people they have sex with as if they're comparing sport scores!!      I don't know if I'm in love, now that I think about it. I don't even know if I have ever been in love. But I do know this. That one guy in my life is amazing, and I care so much about him. I wake up thinking of him, and I go to bed dreaming of him. He makes me smile, and laugh, and care. He makes me feel happy. =)      Melinda, my best friend also makes me feel happy, and cared about. She makes me smile and laugh. She's my best friend. She means alot to me, I don't think she realizes that though. We've been through so much together in 4 years. And I wouldn't trade any of our memories, the good or the bad for anything in the world. Ever. I hope we go through so many more years. So many more good times. So many more bad times. Either way I'll always be there for her, and she'll always be there for me. Because fact is; I love her. she's amazing!   And I am so much more lucky then you or all your big groups of friends. Because I have one. But that's all I need.      Melinda,   I ******* love you!! =)   Best Friends Forever And Ever!! =)

20090131141111AAlmf8p	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	So, whaddya think, everybody?	The volatile slowly increased with every growing minute as she stepped squeak in the murderous night. How wonder magician in the ever loving fondle? Nobody save the mandate will right the terrible freedom. Be a lover’s walk through the moonlit rush. Have the dignity to crash a mighty loud. Slavery shall be the one who understands my meaning. Sun and waterfalls are the eagle upon thy forehead. And no goblet earthy crumble in the marred opaque face.    I wail in thundering evanescence. Fluorescent lights attack me in the dark execution. Run from the door as it gnashes its tranquility! Happy is the real as the man ties his fins. Always turgid chins stoutly actress in the long. Shunning goddess can only lead to vulnerable. While we wait in joyful adoration, flames lick at her boots. Turquoise will crush the empire a cruelty burn. Whip pillows at the opponent borne thought the night. Stars will drink the meek as cowering foolishness. Heed not the great food under the cloudless tablecloth. Coats and a prophetess await the window of hope. So differentiate scars and black.

I think the idea of free-will & have given it a lot of thought- I think that it doesn't really exist ...i want you to help me understand otherwise if true.   Here's what i think:   We are limited beings who live according to limited conditions...      Every choice that you believe that you are freely taking is just an illusion that you want your mind to believe. The fact that you decide to listen to this romantic song & not a rock song is because of events & past & current experiences that make your present mood the way it is now which leads you to listen to a romantic song...you do not choose to....         I am posting this question here because of curiosity..curiosity that God embedded in us..i am helpless..i cannot fight the fact that this issue is bugging me deeply & i don't think i can put a meaning to life without an explanation to it....      The only way i can think of free-will is if God really exists and the only condition which enables you to freely choose is to either choose God ,if he truly exists, or to continue being brainwashed by this world's fake and shitty values and morals....the concept of free-will is made-up...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....      so tell me what you think...true?...or help me understand otherwise..thank you

Ok so this is one of the most important parts of the book.   my main character (Natalie)  just found out she's moving to Saint Rosa Island,Florida, from Ann Arbor, Michigan.  a couple of nights later she has this dream that she is sitting on the beach, with 5 blond teenagers(Only one is a boy) and in the dream, they're all just sitting there - laughing, blah blah blah.   How would I word this?  It's a critical part, but also I don't want it to be forever long.  (she has this dream every night until she moves to Florida)      now, why its important.   The people in her dreams, she ends up meeting.  they end up being her neighbors.  She thinks that's pretty weird.  well anyways, it ends up that she is the only one who can 'save' their people(im not telling u what they really are)  and the boy is the one who was sending her all those 'Visions' which come to her as dreams.  BTW, the name of my book is called 'vision' because of the guy(Zale) sending the girl(Natalie) these 'visions'         I KNOW ITS LONG! and probably confusing.  I'm not nessicarly asking u to write the dream for me, just asking for ideas.

She does something to her own dad (who is a very important man in the mermaid world coz he is a judge or something) her father is very mad at her and he decides to throw her out of the mermaid world to die alone in the ocean. The mermaid's mom can't bear to see her daughter suffer and convinces her father to send her to the human world so that at least she has a chance of living properly. The mermaid agrees and her parents   secretly send her to the human world. in the meantime, her boyfriend feels bad about what happens so leave the mermaid world to look for her in the ocean (he does not know that shes in the human world now).    that's all i have so far. what do you think. please tell me.

Okay, I realize that this isn't a question, but I thought that I should post this for all those who ask alot of questions about Midnight Sun.    I just read an article  http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20234559...   and the subject turned to Midnight Sun. Because of what Stephenie said about her maybe continuing writing when everyone starts to forget about it, some informed Twilight fans gave Midnight Sun the alias of "Dark High Noon".  So, please from now on refer to Midnight Sun as Dark High Noon. If you do, then we might actually get "Dark High Noon" published.

20090225093913AAo5YDe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Story prolouge + a little in the first chapter...what do you think of it?	The cool breeze, the beach, the sun and the sand beneath my feet.  I sit down on the warm beige blanket of sand and let the calming wind take control of my auburn hair.  Sitting there, thinking, completely comfortable.  I thought I was alone, but there is a small huddle of people by the lapping blue white coated waters.  One of those in the huddle slowly approaches me.  Who is it?  As the figure comes closer I can see that it is a middle aged woman, her brow creased in concentration and a combination of fear and hope is painted on her face.  Her mouth forms a word, but know sound escaped her lips.  I looked back towards the huddle of shadowy figured, they have not moved, but the ocean is receding, now the ocean is completely gone.  The woman is now staring at me with only concern found in her crystal blue eyes.  The temperature was increasing and becoming unbearable.  The woman, still staring, is she not feeling the sweltering heat?  Thirst, thirst, thirst.  A bright white light, then darkness.    I could hear a steady hum next to me, but the beach was gone and there was darkness.  I could feel a soft surface beneath me, but couldn’t move.  I flittered my eyes, but they would not open.    “MOM!  Come quick” came a young voice above the constant humming.  I could hear a shuffle of feet, more than one pair.  I started to become more aware of my surroundings; my right arm resting next to something metal and a rush of fluids in my left arm.

stopping for food and water   Letting my mind wonder   Soaring in the everlasting blue sky   Through clouds of white i fly   My wings flap rapidly as i flutter with the sensation of a new start   And my eyes open sincerely to find the warmth of a kind heart   I am forever living in the dream land of love   I am never diving from the sky above   Living forever with nothing and nothings all i'll need to save   Thats all if i was to be that amazing bird so bold so brave   But truelly i am but a boy living on this hell   To dine with unfriendly people trapped in a shell   To escape would be my dream of a a lifetime   Here i am sealed in the invisible box like a mime   How i wish to escape   How i wish to become more than ever in this world   --------------------------------------...   in the pit of my nothings i swim for happiness   i find nothing but insecure jealousy and stress   oh how i wish to one day live free   where in the field i lay and just be   whatever it is i was meant to   then i will let the sun shine through   to get your your eyes to awaken you   to let your heart feel something new   but as for now i will drown my sorrows   wake up sometime later tomorrow   look around my room to see my things   turn on the radio and it sings   the right tune i need to start my day   to eat at the broken hearts cafe   there special on this glorious evening   a wonderous tree with a rope swing   to swing and sway till night time   when i can lay my head and dream your mine   but i am just a terrible man   but i am trying the best i can

scent of romance ever   so now its for sure   --------------------------------------...   the sun is so hot against my face   as i am skating around this forbidden place   the only thing im worried about is nothing   and thats all i dream of doing   so if you dream that you'll being a no one   than if you do something great it will be outdone   so go live free and happy and just never give up   because theres more to life than living under a cup   to be flipped over and asked if life is there   or just another prayer   to the lord or anyone you believe in   just know when i die im leaving with a grin   cause im gonna be happy with the life i lived   growing learning and being a kid   never shall i be mature and act my age   i am forever a young actor on a stage   performing my moves for all to see   and just let everything be   what it was meant to be   and then i will live out to the fullest   of everything i ever dreamed   i never thought you would mean this much to me
