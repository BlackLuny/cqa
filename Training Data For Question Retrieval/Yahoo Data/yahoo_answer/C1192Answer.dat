rLLyJtqNaa	Oil shines and lubricates hair.    If you are interested in growing your hair, then maintain it by:     1.  Starting with clean hair!  Use a moisturizing shampoo and follow up with a moisturizing conditioner.    2. Maintaining the moisture balance of your hair with a glycerine-based product that contains no protein or petroleum- based ingredients.   (I personally recommend Luster's S Curl Activator and Moisturizer, No Drip Formula.).  Ensure that you cover the ends (the oldest most processed/worn part of the hair).    3. Gently and carefully use a wide tooth comb from tips to ends.  Work your way up through the hair about 1/2" an inch at a time without forcing--you should hear no popping or pinging while you are combing--if you do, carefully lift the comb out and slowly start again (a 2 or 3-in-one comb is good for this purpose).    4.  Using a satin sleep cap or pillowcase to minimize the friction on your hair as you toss and turn in your sleep.    5.  Throw your foam rollers and brush away...    6.  Consider low maintenance hairstyles (buns, french braids, cornrows, etc...)|`|krirxDpwaa	garnier frutis always works.
gyxveVeIaa	Hi! I feel with you! =( What you can do is, if hairspray and wax don't help, is to take a hair slide, pull your fringe to the side and keep it in place with the clip/slide. You can then put some hair spray or even mousse, and that should keep it in place, because I sometimes have that problem too, and hairspray doesn't do the trick alone. That's what I recommend =] If not, you can always try straightening cream or straightening it altogether. Hope I helped, good luck xx|`|1xKS2ak6aa	try glue.

9rhOeppjaa	I had endomolgie done last year, it took me 7 weeks, two sessions p/week for 45 minutes a session (I took the comprehensive package). It worked wonders!  My skin was so firm & tight and all the cellulite did dissapear!  I also lost a few cm's. I finished my last session 24 Dec last year. It is now July and all of the cellulite has returned (and more) as well as the cm's.. I am know being told that I should maintain it with at least 1-2 sessions p/month, always look at my diet and drink lots of water.  This is stuff that i do anyway., except for doing anymore Endomolgie sessions.  So in my opinion- yes, it does work as long as you can afford to keep doing it.  After thousands (yes, literally thousand) I am not going to make invest into any beauty houses or clinics or doctors anymore.  Look at your diet, drink lots of water, exercise and scrub your cellulite.  All the machines does is to increase bloodflow to your skin's upperface anyway.  By excofoliating with a good brush, or coffee granules, sugar or oats, you accomplish the exact same thing.|`|c058cd8101e9c9ead9b0fc9b72f8e99caa	My understanding is that endermologie works but that better solutions are velasmooth or mesotherapy.

Also a pinafore was a generic term used to depict a childs apron. This was put on like a shirt backwards had holes for the arms and was done up with a button or ties behind the neck. Common styles of aprons are:-  Half or waist apron  Bib apron  Pinafore apron  Cobbler apron  All but the waist apron have some sort of bib covering the upper part of the body.  Does anyone wear pinafore aprons?  I do ,and so do a lot of other people. Vintage aprons have become very collectible and aprons seem to be making a comeback especially with women who want to get out of the office and back to the kitchen.    http://plainlydressed.bravepages.com/apr...    See:- Ladies Prairie Apron. A pinafore style apron.|`|pwrful9oaa	pinafores are REALLY old fashioned and they only came up to the waist and you had to pin them on. Aprons are well, you know. they have the ties in the back and they have straps. Pretty much no one wears pinafores but some people wear aprons

So my mom jsut threw everything out expect for hte blush and the brush. The brush isn't even that good.

If you keep having problems go to any Sephora store and tell them you want to test th bare minerals makeup, they will tell you the right makeup color for you and how to use it.    Go to  www. sephora.com  for store locations    By the way, use warm very softly,don't forget use very little product and to tap, it should not change the color of your face just add a soft bronce look, don't over do it.

Purple cancels out orange or get a light brown that has green in the base because green cancels out red. Since I can't see your hair you will have decide ,does your hair look to red or to orange.|`|CbvuVFl9aa	you might need to wait because back to back dye jobs could break your ends and even cause hair to fall out I think you should just use some wash out dye until you are 100% sure you won't risk your hair breaking off.|`|qewOZjQqaa	Go to a salon and have a stylist fix it, otherwise it may end up another weird shade and you won't be very happy with it.|`|FZRZFusuaa	So, you TRIED to dye your hair light brown huh?!?  If you were actually trying to lighten it what happens is you first pull out the red base, then the orange, then yellow, then white ( colors on the color wheel, but obviously the tones are different)  It seems like you did not have a high enough level of developer to kick you to the next level, instead you stopped where you did not want to be.    If you were actually dying ( adding color and going darker) you must have used the wrong undertone color.  In either case, all you need is a toner.  Again, the color wheel.  To correct an orange/red color and bring it to a neutral light brown you will need to use a blue/green toner ( blue is opposite orange and green is opposite red on the color wheel)  in the level that your hair is currently at.  Good luck- hope this helped, let me know if you have more ?'s|`|AA10828189	Condition your hair with a good conditioner for three days. then use a light ash brown on it. This should give you the color you were trying for in the first place.  You have a lot of red tones in your hair, this is why it ended up orange. Anytime you want to go lighter you will need to use ash tones. If you ever decide to go blonde have a professional do it, because with your hair color undertones it is notoriously difficult to go blonde.|`|dd0379a48fcf4feacfd57cd6b8c0f412aa	Probaby ought to go to beautician....|`|uR3i03lNaa	sue for faulty labeling...haha just kidding...you should probably try and dye it again if you don't like the color|`|aErN9tDlaa	The next time you dye your hair at home, make certain that the color has a neutral base - not warm.

zdy8m4N1aa	well if you liked her and she was nice and gentle, but did a good job, I'd tip her $3.00-4.00. if you really liked her i'd go 5.00.    If you just go in for a polish change, $2.00, if she does them how you like.      If you hated the service, don't be affraid to not tip at all. why pay for a good job if she didn't even try? it's the manicurist's effort to please my needs that i tip for. and i tip well when it's deserved.|`|E67wp1XLaa	a decent tip is 20%, but because i'm in the industry (a hairstylist), i tend to leave more. i give $10 for my pedi, $10 for my fill, and $5 for a polish change.|`|keHGFhKyaa	I think it always depends on the service you get, not what you get done. Any where from $2-$8 is good, but if they don't treat you the way you think you should have been treated then don't feel like you need to tip them more.    There is really no set amount, just depends on the service they provide.

There are fake flower clips, real flower clips, flowers on headbands, and even the use of natural flowers. Flowers can add a real nice touch to a hairstyles, especially fresh flowers. The two images of Paris here show great use of flowers as hair accessories. A small orange flower pin adds a little tweak to a simple hairstyle while the yellow flower clip in the other image adds an additional touch to an already beautiful wavy hairstyle.          Hair Jewelry            Hair jewelry probably is the most used hair accessories because of the variety of different types of jewels, different styles, and sparkle that comes with using these hair items. Because different colors of jewels go along with different shades, there are choices to be made. For example a light blue or aquamarine will highten blonde hair while bright reds can bring out brunnette hair. In the first image, Paris sports a nice jewel clip that brings a sparkle to a beautiful hairstyle. Because the hair is pinned behind the ears, a jewel accessory in this location is perfect. The second images shows a more low key Paris with a simple hairstyle topped of with a beautiful butterfly jewel clip. Another successful use of hair accessories.          Hair accessories can be a nice addition to both low key and high profile hairstyles as shown by Paris's images. Try using a headscarf or adding a beautiful hair clip to a favorite hairstyle to see if it adds an additional touch to it. The last image of Paris here is just for fun and most women will not wear find too many occasions to wear this hair accessory. It is a Hello Kitty pink and white tiara that creates a very cute look which might be great for the little women out there.
aXn47n6waa	I like using a facial steamer to loosen up blackheads, and zits. I use my steamer about twice a week, and it keeps blackheads away. You can buy them in most stores like Target or Wal-mart.     If the area that was infected is all healed you could use a concealer on it. First use a green concealer to hide the redness, then use a concealer to match your skin color. Finish up with some powder.|`|sHC7RPPuaa	try a biore pore minimizing lotin or cream.  and try to use some toners.  close your pores after washing with ice cold water|`|pXfE195kaa	Large pores are created in two ways and large pores are present anywhere like nose, face or facial skin. The first is through aggressive squeezing of blackheads and whiteheads, which stretches the pore. The second is heavy sebum production. When the sebaceous gland produces large volumes of sebum, the pore is forced to expand to release the oil and is therefore enlarged.     ENLARGED PORES due to natural ageing process and / or oily skin that has been over dried, forcing dead skin cells to harden in the pores and stretch them.    For some of us, enlarged pores are a daily cosmetic annoyance. The good news is that there are ways to minimise their appearance and smooth out your complexion     Home remedies for the treatment and care for large pores   Mix almond meal with enough water to make a paste. Apply to pores for 20 minutes. Rinse with warm water, then apply witch hazel or a solution of apple cider vinegar and water.    Bran and Grapefruit is also used to tightens large pores.    Mix table salt and buttermilk into a paste, apply on enlarged pores and massage well. Rinse with warm water.     If enlarged pores are due to blackheads stretching the entrance of the pore, then firstly remove blackheads using one of the above methods, then to contract pores, blend (one or your preferred mixture) of camphor, sage and / or thyme in a base of jojoba oil. Use as a compress or mix in with your moisturiser and apply to affected areas. Jojoba is easily absorbed into the skin and balances oil levels (which may assist in reducing blackheads as sebum production is regulated).   Tips on reducing large pores   The best you can do is keep pores debris-free with thorough cleansing, exfoliation, masks and professional facials - all will help make pores appear slightly smaller.|`|0aroY4qMaa	the mineral powder makeups literally make your pores vanish! also they are great at evening out skin tone.My daughter was amazed when I showed her how to completely cover a hickey (she is over 21)using only the mineral makeup!|`|AA11229240	get some aspirin- the less coated the better. in a small bowl add a little warm water and wait for the aspirin to dissolve. mix it up to make a paste consistency then apply to your face in the area of the large pores. when it dries, rinse it off and you will find that your pores look much smaller and your skin overall will look shiny and healthy. it is not a permanent solution bu there really isn't one for large pores unfortunately. if you want to read testimonials about the aspirin mask click the link below!|`|SombsU8baa	Why dont try to use "Forever Living"?

It will not damage the hair, just add lots of conditioning, especially if you have spent a lot of time in the sun.|`|Wf7oegMraa	A gloss is a demi-permanent color that is lighter than your natural color. It can be clear, have a red, orange, gold, or cool tone. It makes your hair appear healthier because it reflects the light better. It can also brighten a drab color. Your hair may feel thicker because of the chemical, and there is basically no damage, especially on healthy hair.  The stylist mixes the no ammonia color with a low peroxide developer and applies it all over your hair. It stays on 5-15 minutes (depending on your hair & desired results). Then it is rinsed out. They should then use a good acidic conditioner to close the cuticle. You should wait 24-48 hours before shampooing.  Most people like the effect because it does add shine to your hair. However, if you are outside a lot or swim more than a couple times a month.

The more times a week you put it in the better it will work...however like i said before don't expect results after the first few days...it takes time.|`|8407961983790326dc00261b0285f653aa	'Bout, 2 hrs. Should do the trick. Good luck!!!xxxx.
RHU6URjmaa	A standard piercing is usually 20 or 18 gauge. Lip piercings mostly range from 20 to about 14 ga. Here's a chart that shows what sizes and their measurements are http://www.organicjewelry.com/GaugeInchM...|`|97RYaY8paa	plz tell me too i think im going to do it 2morrow and im only 13 well i already have 6  this is going to be my 7th well good luck with your answer|`|a43c0cb19fa5434d4e481704d160a2ccaa	it doesn't really hurt, but everyone experiences pain differently. when i got mine it wasn't bad, i was expecting far worse. it felt like a toothpick going through (sounds painful i know but it isn't). um, most places will give you a bag of sea salt, and you mix it with water then soak your lip for a few minutes. after you eat, you need to rinse your mouth with an alcohol-free mouthwash. as far as sizes go i'm not quite sure but they put a big ring first so it can accomodate for the swelling.  check out www.bmezine.com , thats where i went before i got mines done|`|xyqs21tAaa	Its not really painful at all but it depends how well u take pain.  You can buy a spray thats called H2Ocean  and you just simply spray it on and use a q tip to clean it. but make sure u use it 3 times a day so it heal scar tissue and provent it getting infected. Lip rings come in different sizes like 14g or 16g. the bigger the number the smaller the gauges get.    good luck!!!|`|e8198bb6f46f1bacf502e96db65800b9aa	It is not a painful thing to do from 1-10 its a 2.    You would need to clean it with a certain type of mouth wash, the risk are keloids, and tooth separation and cyst bumps along with piercing rejection.      It would not look bad on you good luck on it.

Purple makes green eyes pop!|`|52e52cdeb3432145c8a40ff78cd466c5aa	Your eyes are a greeny hazel. I would wear lots of mascara and eyeliner (not enough to look emo, unless you already are) and curl my lashes and to not bring attention to the lips (to make your eyes stand out even more) i would wear a neutral lip gloss. Don't go for green or blue eyeshadow up to your eyebrows cause that looks gay.|`|i0jqWiScaa	You eyes look green in the picture (the first one, the 2nd does have a shadow). and so i cant tell you what color to always wear because it might not match what your wearing. so you should wear like a gold-ish color, or a soft brown. you could go to a Mac store and they have so many beautiful eyeshadows and you can even ask the assistant for an opinion. she may have a better one than any of us.|`|oFnXjgGyaa	go to wikihow.com and search for like eye shadow or colors hope it helps!!

UoFhDojwaa	NOTHING at all! You can PREVENT them with the help of some lotions and Oils, but when You have them You have them.  Over time they fade some, and are less noticeable. The only way to get rid of them is have them Surgically removed.|`|ar6UTk0aaa	you could try cocoa butter.. thats what everyone says...i haven't tried it but my sister told me not to scratch your stretch marks cuz thats makes them worse.. instead rub the area that itches..|`|RXVFkLGtaa	nope, if it does, i would be doing it  use cocoa butter|`|2Ttue8mIaa	You can't rub anything on them to make them disappear, but cocoa butter can help fade them if you use it consistently.  Over time, however, they do tend to fade on their own even if you don't use cocoa butter.  If you want to have them removed permanently, you can see a cosmetic surgeon I've heard that now they can  use a lazer to get rid of them. It' the same type used to get rid of tattoos.
36YoMuUOaa	it sounds hott to me..:)    someone help?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|GqvAXWNcaa	I think you should just make it a sidefringe.. sidefringes are nice.

XD|`|qhvb9XCVaa	upload a pic so I can have a better judgment please|`|OqnnJcJMaa	it would look a little off.....make sure you cut the same amount of length off for the rest of your head|`|kiYSxNKlaa	skater hair is cool!!  but yeah it would probably look fine if you cut it just above your eyebrow.....as long as you don't have a mono brow =]  hope it goes well.  =]|`|C7IUgdVCaa	It looks like your going for the more rocker look, I'm assuming. In that case I say go for it, I mean when it comes to hair in the end it always grows back.|`|Z1vPhbADaa	it all depends on how YOU wear the hear cut.  when i was in college i remember a guy was sporting a ponytail where i have my  bangs, it was like a horn of a unicorn. there was no way this hair do was even a little bit nice or attractive. however, he walked around campus with his head up(confident i would say) didn't avoid anyone and was very laid back(cool). so he actually was able to pull it off. so whether or not your hair cut will be a mess or not is up to you, and how you wear it.  let me know how it turns out. by your description i would say try something else.|`|zSBrK6eLaa	ya hello guy bangs?!?!   TOTALLY HOTT cuz all sk8tr hair is HOTT!!  i say cool not stupid at all but mabey a lil  bit below the eye brows would b good|`|fIIpDOo2aa	i think guys with long hair are sexy but that is just me, and every one in my town.... keep it long dude|`|46mCzLkAaa	My hair takes times to settle into one place. For instance i always had a part in the middle of my head (ew), i then wanted to get a full fringe, it took around two weeks for my fringe to stop parting. I now have a side fringe and it is refusing to stay.    I use a hairdryer every morning. I blow dry in the direction i want it to go and hold it down with my hand untill it cools (this is how straighteners/curlers work... heat) I also use sometimes hairgel/spray    If you don't want to put gel/hairspray in your hair all the time or blowdry it everyday, get the front cut and keep it relatively long to make it look natural but make sure it is layered in a way that it will suite the rest of your hair. In my opinion though, this would probably look stupid, so if i were you I would try the blowdryer and gel/spray.        >> Garnier Fructis Style. explosive putty. manga head. extreme |`|AKKDXZxZaa	cut the front just a bit below the eyebrows!|`|5yaNeOcSaa	Yeah go for a change.  Ask the hair stylist about coloring some of it.  You will feel fresh and new with a new do.

hxNnDZTMaa	Jess you look lovely just the way you are.  Your skin is not pasty but alabaster or ivory.  Think Nicole Kidman!  (but if you don't like the colour, you can add a bit of foundation and blusher)  Your photos remind me of Snow White: 'a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony.  They named the baby princess Snow White'.  As you age and white hair appears it will soften the contrast of the black hair against your pale skin.  Mother Nature knows best.  |`|EJre8LVHaa	dark reddish brown (more so brown) for sure!! it would look so cute on you!    ps. you dont look pasty at all! you look like a character from a book|`|Two2I151aa	u look gorgeous. lol   well, ur hair color matches u because u r light skinned. i think u should keep it that way.  or maybe try  brown.     good luck|`|1XhLR3o0aa	It looks so pretty already! but if you must, I think auburn is a really great color that also goes well with light skin.

Dark hair really suits you, though.|`|bi4NGj8Iaa	There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with your complexion or your hair color which compliments your skin beautifully. The only change I see that you need is to smile much more. Everything else is as close to perfect as a young lady will ever get.   If you still have doubts, consider this. I would be thrilled to have you on my arm walking with me in a crowded public place knowing that every guy there would be jealous.|`|LtgULiI3aa	You should stay with dark colours, maybe dark brown or black but with some reddish highlight (but not too bright). You are just too pretty..
73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Yup. You got it right =)    Chapstick has Petroleum jelly (Vaseline basically) and aloe in it, so it heals chapped lips|`|x37JGCzSaa	Lip balm can hydrate. It's great for shine too, but if you use it for a awhile, your lip should be nice and hydrated. Also lip gloss can help to moisturize too. I personally like lip gloss the best because it gives the most shine and my lips are never chapped. |`|Cd7Irs54aa	lip balm can also hydrate|`|AA11829081	yes that is rite|`|cby4aCp7aa	I've never found lip balms anywhere near as good as Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream.  Comes in a tube that you can use on lips, elbows etc, but also in a lipslick form, which also comes in clear (like the tube cream) or about 6 different shades...so it colours while it cares!

TXqQDTWsaa	It is NOT gross or weird. Quite the opposite - It's a turn-on for most guys, and even many other girls.    It's as much a part of your body as the shape of your butt, or bra-size. I'm sure those are things that you don't mind showing off, protruding nipples should be no different.    Don't worry about it, embrace your sexy-ness. :)|`|qcQJIxU7aa	ummm weird. but u cant help it. sux for u. sorry|`|cd9ccdfe958b07ea5c171be4be17c922aa	I guess it might seem embarassing, but I'd say don't worry about it. It happens naturally and there is nothing you can do about it. Just enjoy your summer and have fun at camp.|`|hnhb119Laa	Only American girls are worried about this nonsense.  If you went to France  or Italy or England or Germany or Spain or almost ANYWHERE else, you probably wouldn't even be wearing a bra at all at your age, in warm weather.  Most civilized people consider nipples to be a normal, attractive part of a woman.|`|NF7hF01vaa	it might me to some people..  but i personally don't think that it's weird   and you can buy those sticky things to put on them so they won't show i'm just not sure what they're called lol|`|8ENRWmoMaa	i personnally think its a little slutty, but if you look good then its still hot.|`|4EeemlTwaa	well i see some older woman like that and i think oh, ew she kinda forgot.. but i think it s just embarrassing.|`|kFOxlebDaa	Are they showing cause your cold? Or just showing.. my nipples some how always have a way of showing.. its annoying.  I started to wear padded bras cause of it.  But i think if you re not intentionally showing them then its fine!|`|52cYlA7Haa	Well it's not like you're trying to. You're at camp and wearing a sports bra. You can't help it. It's not your fault, don't worry about it. Everyone is different.=]]|`|RJ0rynWlaa	maybe theres not enough padding in your sports bra. Its probably to small/thin for you. But i would consider it kind of slutty.|`|90k6INjqaa	you just might be one of those girls that nipples protrude or stay hard throughout their activities of the day.. if this bothers you very much.. at night before you sleep trying putting a thin slice of cucumber on your nipples.. leave it on for about an hour or so.. pretty much they just need to be helped.. like dry skin on your face..   it sounds incredibly weird.but totally works.. that or you can just run around hard all day.. it is normal but you will beg etting looks|`|6Fl6t5kGaa	what? NO its not gross, it's natural..    besides it looks cute .^_^|`|BtEbiwLxaa	you may think it was embarrassing but it happens.

So then your hair is pulled way up and it's really high. Good luck!
GE4PfBpMaa	Stars =)    I have a star tattooed on my wrist and the pain wasn't so bad, its like a irratating itch being scratched. Like the pain aint bad, not on the wrist anyways. You could get a star for each special person in your life. Get two big ones merging together to symbolise you + your hubby. Than get little ones around them to symbolise your child and future children (when they happen).     Stars are special. They mean light, guidance and hope. |`|EFz2Y9jZaa	Depending on whether your into astrology or not, you could get the star symbol for husband and your daughter down the centre of your back (on your spine), that way if you have more kids you can just add theirs underneath. You could even put yours below your husbands before your daughters if you wanted.|`|1TfxGkVJaa	how about get two roses with two banners and  their names on it. For my grandmother i did a cross and two roses with a banner and name on my left forearm.|`|dXmfv4beaa	My names Adrianna too.. thats awesome. I like when people get their child's foot prints or hand prints. A portrait of both of them would be a good idea too|`|hqGpkSu5aa	well my husband has a tatto with my name and our daughter is a hearth with a ribbon around it and in the ribbon it has our names it looks pretty good you can also go to yahoo and look for tattos pictures am thinking about getting one and theres alot of pretty ones in yahoo well good luck       http://www.tattoojohnny.com/search.asp?k...      http://tattoospot.com/      http://www.zoinkies.com/tattoos/|`|MYtn10iRaa	I seen somethink that really cool to honor a baby that just born is get a tattoo of their foot print or hands print, and maybe u can put something that your husband really like as the back ground to honor him... And another idea is a male lions with a lion cub will be rad...    Just ignore people that not belongs to your question... They just a helpless people... |`|AA12392755	And what happens in 10 years when you are no longer married to this man and want to marry someone else?  Please don't think it cannot happen to you.  Just something to think about.|`|oiQTd3Hpaa	A friend of mine drew a small family tree tattoo for her wrist using her family members' initials. It looks very elegant, and tasteful. Play around a bit with your husband & daughter's initials with different fonts, you may come across something you like. good luck! :)|`|0a3365e60ed6ac719c848e7eee088ff9aa	Ugh, thats the dumbest thing ever....a tattoo doesn't honor anything it just makes you look like trash. Honor your daughter by taking care of her and not spending money on dumb crap. Honor your husband by being smart and using the money he makes wisely. See this is what happens when young dumb people play house....they forget that its not about them anymore.  
Qe76m5hLaa	well, i'd say she looks cute and wild also. she seems really nice, smart, friendly,shy bt also with humor, sensible and sensitive...   in general i can think only positive things about her... i dont know... that kind of person she reminds me|`|DwfLFrNHaa	ok she is very cute and sweet and her eyes is also very beautiful|`|26LfPRPOaa	her eyes and eye lashes are really nice, but her face  shows shes 25|`|256c43648a3ff7ebe8ea9068e90abd62aa	Why is the picture called Urgh?!

cmrrIQ5faa	Personally - I don't like it nor do I find it attractive or cool.  I have tattoos and piercings, so it is not because I am a square.  I think it is just kind of gross...plus what will your ears look like when you are old? I know...I know - people ask me the same thing about my tats but those aren't hanging from the side of my face either.    Sorry...but you did ask!    Have a good day!|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Depends.  If you do them right, and your ears don't look like crap, then I think they're attractive.  But, if you stretch to fast & have blowouts, and wear crappy jewelry, then thats just gross.  |`|AA10462002	eeeeewwww no|`|v71wb9MBaa	its gross and very unattractive on both guys and girls..especially girls..and when you grow out of the stage of having that...they won't fix by themselves..you'll need a surgical procedure!|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	i don't mind them my gf has them but they are like 12g so they are really tiny.|`|bljBwqCaaa	i quite like them, only if they are small. i don't like them when they get to like 00g.. that's too big for me. |`|HB38sMkfaa	awesome.    my lobes are stretched to 1/2"|`|0PTpD5Dcaa	I used to have stretchers on both sides.

It gives me the chills, LOL    My brother has them and I don't even like to look at them!!|`|6y5JIm0kaa	do you mean like stretched with those circular things or stretched like old ladies with the ears that look like their about to rip from the heavy earrings...|`|rAoGO7UOaa	i'm almost certain that when you get old and wrinkly and saggy and your ear drags along the floor you'll regret it|`|QXoH01Fiaa	I use to have stretched ears for four years, both at a 00g. I recently took them out, partly because of curiousity, and they closed up fine. I love stretched ears. Everyone says that they are ugly, but I don't see anything wrong with them. I just don't like it when the stretching gets out of hand. After a certain point, the stretching gets a little tacky to me. Nowadays, everyone is stretching their ears. It's kind of strange now. I'll most likely stretch again and return to my 00's. :D|`|wVeXnT4Faa	I think it depends on your age...and gender!  I used to think they were awesome when i was around 16..now i'm 21 and i think they look terrible. I guess it comes with entering the world of cubicles and skirt suits. |`|AXLSchkjaa	I have em, it depends on who's wearing them. Like I have a friend whos are huuge but, they look great so w/e. But when people do it and they don't suit them it's just bad. So it depends on the person I suppose.

r1ixMGvtaa	Yes they are still in. No matter how many people say uggs are 'out of style' they will always be 'in' because of their comfort you NEED for winter. To tell you the truth, i've seen more people wearing uggs ALREADY than i have the past few years, not even October yet and uggs are already selling out of the stores and online very quickly. Uggs will always be a must have, and are the warmest most stylish thing still this winter.  :)|`|bTFk9tVHaa	chyeahh . :)    but what i dont understand is why people are wearing them with jean shorts.. i think it looks slutty .   but thats another story haha. |`|Xdtz7bFPaa	ewe no.  they never should have been in.    lol no actually fringe boots, like these, are very in for this season! the native american style is extremely trendy for the upcoming fall/winter! But be sure not to pair them together, ex: beaded earrings and too much fringe, suede jacket! just dont! haha    http://images.condenastinteractive.co.uk...    Minnetonka boots are a great brand, with a variety of styles and aren't too expensive!    Don't be afraid to create your own styles though, start some new trends :]    Have fun!|`|RPt4nDxqaa	Idk.. probably. |`|PxtmMAMnaa	uggs have been "going out" for years and nomatter how much people say they are... theyre not going anywhere because they are comfortable and basics. nobodys going to stop wearing them so theyre not going out anytime soon.|`|jlgpKao1aa	Sure.I love UGGS.  |`|qs81EDItaa	Hmmm, I didnt like them, until I saw this really cute girl in my college class wearing something like this:    h t t p : / / ww w. celebritybeautybuzz .c o m/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/blake-livel...    ***without the spaces***    If youre cute/hott, have nice legs, uggs look nice when you have a nice top, skirt and tights.  Now if you have REALLY nice legs, then you can wear them without the tights, but even with the tights it looks cute.   **Oh, and if youre Blake Lively, you can just look pretty in anything**|`|N4K24dzaaa	Uggs have never been "in"   or atleast they shouldnt have..since i live in florida, and it never gets cold enough to need any kind of snow shoe here.|`|nJSNAYIJaa	hell yeah !  i know im gonna def. buy them this year.|`|gs1gvsrSaa	Uggs are awesome!!!
GuYG16vKaa	Whichever option you choose, you might have to pay a premium to rush your order.    You could try a seamstress, a tailor, the dry cleaners.    Good luck, and have fun!|`|nB67im6Yaa	Cheapest quick fix:  Exchange it for a larger one.  If that's not an option then take it to a tailor.   If they aren't too busy then it shouldn't take longer than half a day.    Good luck,  and have fun at the dance.
l6UKwzUXaa	When you get it cut, ask to have it RAZORED or thinned out, and layered.    Then, at home, take a hair straightener, and take the top half of your hair (Like you are about to put it in a half pony), clip that up,  and straighten the bottom layer. when that is all straight, let the top layer down in mini-layers and straighten those.    Straightening your hair gets rid of the frizz.    Trust me, I have the same hair consistency (:    Get it thinned out, and WHATEVER YOU DO, do not put any heat defense stuff in your hair, it makes it all bristely and lifeless, and .... yukk.    Good luck!      Oh, and get side bannnnngs and flat iron those too (;|`|gcYDA1ZRaa	flat iron it & get tons of layers!|`|BkJccdpNaa	flat iron it!        http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|yn6ikr1waa	well i think u should cut it in layers and c a hair stylist so they an help u figure out ur best hair style that will frame ur face. Or u cood jus straighten it or get a perm. But after taking a shower dry ur hair brush it and tie an a pony tail and when u take ur hair down it will be less frizzy but dont 4get to condition ur hair always! hope this helped :)|`|LxrHzHnHaa	i would flat iron your hair. many people say to flat iron it AND thin it but i stongly disagree! because a flat iron not only straightens your hair but-well flatens it. (hence the fact its called a FLAT iron) and yes do use heat glides because a flat iron will make your hair frizz and defenslis if u DONT use it and heat glides actually protect your hair and give it the extra shine it needs after being flat ironed-and keeps it straight all day better-and elimanates frizz! but also if u get a fllat iron invest ina  good one. flat irons are the type of thing that u must buy and expensive one in order to have a good long lasting one! good luck! :D|`|cdhfYDWUaa	Well it depends on how curly your hair is. but if your hair is really curly, i suggest not blow drying. trust me i have semi curly hair and every time i blow dry it, it gets big and poofy!         one way to tame your frizz is to maybe get a trim (just to cut off the split ends) or to buy some hair products that's meant just to tame frizz.    also, if you ever want to have really straight hair i suggest buying conair's wet to straight straightener. honestly, it really straightens your hair! |`|YExgSFWOaa	hey my hair looks just like yours!!!  hehe  well i usually straighten it   so you should try that too |`|7bVIj1Pdaa	Grow it out the shoulder length than cut all the "flippy" end bits off so its about 3 fingers above your shoulders than use Head and shoulders dadndruf shampoo i know you probably dont have dandruf but ti help you hair go smoothing and straighter and then if you condition with herbal essances dangeroulous straight it works:)|`|u3Eeswnhaa	get ur hair tapered and some dark brown highlights and a conditioning treatment and also start straightning it|`|p4yOAJS1aa	i also have curly hair wat i do is  so it wont be so  frizzy i buy this leave in conditioner  after ur done taking a shower  put it  on then leave it till it drys  !! trust me it works

WIVpzIdhaa	a sexy pirate|`|Q8UrDhPYaa	Minnie Mouse. Or a bunny.|`|fShlKEfYaa	At work we would often have a Halloween dress-up and the bosses always came as witch. Pointed Black Hat, eye liner, fingernails, jewelry, plush black cat. Or go as an ER doctor with an operating room costume like on the Grey's Anatomy show. Other ideas are cartoon characters or famous celebrity singers/performers or a character from a favorite movie or TV show. For example, a cute costume to make is Wilma Flintstone, with a pearl necklace made of strung cotton-balls, and a hand-made leopard-skin print cotton-material dress with a jagged cut hem.  If you have a hobby or special interest, it is fun to get a costume that allows you to share that interest in conversation, such as a family member in Iraq - could get a military fatigues outfit, or a fisherwoman, a sailor captain. If you are going with a friend, perhaps you want to have a similar matching costume.  At one party a group of friends dressed up as the ZZ-Top band with the long beards and hand-made guitars. Check out a costume rental online or a store near you to get some more ideas|`|toc0S2Fkaa	how about a beauty queen? all you need to do is get a cheap plastic crown, a cute dress, and a sash =]|`|dQdYUFVBaa	Sailor girl.

IdX7L7JHaa	Likely it's the length of your hair that's causing the curl-up.  If your hair rests on your shoulders at all once straightened, it will curl up like that.  There are two ways to fix this: get your hair cut so that it does not touch your shoulders when straightened, or wait it out until your hair grows well past your shoulders.|`|zCJW3T5Zaa	SAME WITH ME! i hate it idk what to doo!! it makes me look younger =[ i hate itt|`|WgnOe4Ppaa	do u hav any pics?|`|fKbRIxzKaa	Why don't you get your hair chemically straightened? I've heard this is an effective method of hair straightening.  Hope I have been of help.|`|DBMWOd1kaa	curl it inwards or have it up in curlers (inward) the take them out and straighten it|`|rtnWPBvBaa	How do you comb your hair? I think it may have to do with the direction you comb it. My hair is really... easily modified? As in my hair is easily changed by what I do to it. Sometimes if I gets straightened by a really hot iron (professional salon kind) after a haircut, the hair stays pretty straight even after a few weeks. If I comb my hair one way, it will curve that way, but if I comb my hair to the other side, the curve will change. So maybe your hair is like mine. If you always comb your hair outward, try combing from the underside (comb between your hair and neck) and maybe it will balance out.

I would avoid using washing up liquid, think of what this does to your hands after a couple of uses, now think of your hair! seriously the dye will fade after you wash it but dont go to extremes or you will end up with horrible dead looking hair and you will spend a fortune on trying to repair it with deep conditioning treatments or maybe even cutting it.     Just let it naturally fade down a little or face damaged hair!    Good luck!!! :)

CkkEscwWaa	u gota do something when ur nervous/anxious and im glad to hear u got ur purse back. made my day|`|H4UxIqe2aa	it's different to all people. some bite their nails, some chew their hair. it can be stress, a coping mechanism or a strange enjoyment.  i chew my nails REALLY badly, to the point of ripping them completely off, and have tried everything. i eventually sort to asking mum to take me to a hypnotist, he worked with me a few weeks, and it turns out my chewing nails is cause from a lack of self esteem - my conscience believes i don't deserve good nails. he has these tests they do with your mind, it sounds strange and is hard to explain i know, lol. but yeah, just something people do to take their mind off something else.|`|8524a68989b121f81dc082d5197661d3aa	im not sure if this is true, but my history teacher said that it is because it subconsciously reminds us of breast feeding because it was the ultimate comfort zone, you had shelter, warmth, food, and love. that is also why we chew gum to relieve stress. so basically you put things in your mouth to relieve stress and go back to that comfort zone.|`|NdC2s0F5aa	Hard to say, since I was little, and now i'm 19 years old, I STILL DO IT and i even go at my skin as well...

Its not always out of stress, could be from boredom, excitement, etc.     A way to stop biting your nails is to go to the local drug store and you can buy this polish or liquid to put on top of your nails. Then when you go for a bit, the taste is so nasty it will help you quit the biting do to the taste.|`|3jwXB5araa	i really dont know, but i used 2 do that in 4th grade and i stopped because it was nasty, my teeth hurt and my nails would be sharp and everytime i would scratch myself it would hurt a little.|`|05aKFYl5aa	i don't bite my nails but my brother and my best friend do. they say it's become a habit for them ever since they were really young and now they can't leave their nails long. it doesn't have to do with stress, just a habit. just like how cracking knuckles becomes a habit, biting nails becomes one too.|`|teNUDFtGaa	CUZ IT TASTES GOOD.|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Stress, anxiety, boredom, something to do with your hands, fidgeting.|`|uU1oLpdDaa	idk I have bit mine since I was a kid.|`|xZhws6cLaa	i do. and ugh its one of the worst habits in the world.   like its a feeling you cant resist.   and i tend to do it and not even know even though i want to stop so bad. it all started when i was a child. and the habit hasnt gone away at all.|`|gzMZRbmIaa	They are nervous or don't know what to do with their hands. Or maybe they have long nails and didn't clip them lol.|`|DFoBVHw8aa	well its better than pulling out your hair or scratching until you bleed|`|4PV0o4pBaa	nervousness or excitement|`|NBLH8XY4aa	it depends on the person........my brother has been doing it for yrs we tell him to stop but.........its when u have worries generally....to some it feels natural when they are worrying and its the closest thing to them where they can pick at it and soon it becomes a habit

ADVERTISE your brand|`|99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	oooo, how fun!  well, obviously, you have to assemble a nice selection of clothes, and then start promoting your store.  make sure you promote it and then start making clothes, otherwise you might find that you've made all the clothes but now have to wait so much longer for recognition.    make sure you have connections, if you know what i mean.  powerful people can help you if they like you.

Don't use so much chemicals in your hair, for that will damage it. However, if you really hate your long hair and would like to find a way to get it straighter, you could go to the hairshops and salons that specialize in doing hair and tell them you would like to get your hair straightened. Did you know you could get your hair permanently straightened by some special solution?|`|9572f9e1140ca9d38f91ca32dd5472d5aa	Well I had that problem ,just grow it out a bit and straighten it|`|99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	Revostyler =D|`|6946e33a272d9a642a5d210a7a284087aa	let it grow out for long term effects.straighten it with an iron,no more than a couple times a week(can really eff up your hair)|`|25fc785bc9e35b5cbbdd81d02e545694aa	some great curl products are deva curl and ouidad. if one of these salons are close to you go! they are filled of professional stylists that will help you learn how to take care of your hair.  if you really hate it than hey just permanently straighten it. dont listen to anyone that says it will ruin your hair. yuko and chi are two of my favorite gentle brands.  make sure you go to a professional salon and expect to pay around $500 (i'm in the ny area) for a good job.   good luck

r9wrDGm2aa	Developer is the oxidizing agent that allows the haircolor to do its job. Most permanent haircolor today uses hydrogen peroxide as a developer. The peroxide opens the cuticle so that the color can penetrate. It also disperses the existing color and can lighten the hair's color level depending on the strength of the peroxide formulation.  The peroxide developer's oxidizing potential is denoted as its 'volume'. Most haircolor formulas today work with a 10, 20, or 30 volume developer. The effects of these developer strengths are as follows:        10 Volume Peroxide is a standard oxidizing strength for permanent, no-lift haircolor. Designed for use when you simply want to add a tint or color tone to hair of the same lightness level, 10 Volume Peroxide opens the cuticle layer of the hair allowing the color molecules to penetrate and color to be deposited in the cortex.          20 Volume Peroxide is also a common strength with permanent haircolor and opens the hair cuticle like 10 Volume, but also offers lifting of the hair's level by 1-to-2 levels. 20 Volume Peroxide is used to best effect when the hairs starting level is no more than one shade darker than the color you are trying to achieve.          30 Volume Peroxide works just like 20 Volume except that it will lift the hair's starting color by 2-to-3 levels and works best when the target color is no more than two levels lighter than the starting color. It's important to remember that the stronger the developer is, the harsher it can be on your hair. You should always use a moisturizing conditioner after applying a stronger haircolor.          There are Hydrogen Peroxide Developers that are stronger than 30 Volume (there is also 40 Volume and 50 Volume formulas), but you should NEVER use these strengths on your own. Developers above 30 Volume strength work very quickly, and without careful monitoring, these formulas can destroy the integrity of your hair.     Lighteners:  Right now, you're probably asking yourself "If 30 Volume Peroxide is the strongest developer you recommend, how do I get my dark brown hair (level 3) to blonde (level 8)?  The answer is relatively simple. You'll need to use a lightener first.    Lighteners are bleaching agents that are mixed with developers to decolorize - or lift the color from - the hair, usually in preparation for adding a lighter color tone, or for generating dramatic highlights.  Lighteners come in two basic types - on-the-scalp lighteners and off-the-scalp lighteners. They're classified as such because they are designed to be safe when applied on or off the scalp as the name indicates. Off-the-scalp lighteners are much stronger and should never be used so that they come in direct contact with the scalp  because they will cause chemical burns. These lighteners are generally designed for use with highlighting or frosting caps where they don't rest on the head.     On-the-scalp lighteners are formulated to be safely applied to the hair and in the scalp area. Often, on-the-scalp lighteners are slower working, but infinitely safer for the scalp.Using any lightener requires careful monitoring of the hair as it is being decolorized, because it can easily be over-processed. However, once you get your hair  lightened to the desired level, you can then color it as you desire, and know that you'll get the color you are trying for. You should also remember that while haircolor when mixed with a developer goes  inert after 30 minutes, lighteners will remain active as long as they are moist. As a result, even a lightener mixed with only 10 Volume Peroxide can result in over- processing if not watched carefully.  You also want to be careful that your hair is in good condition before you lighten it.    Damaged or porous hair can become irreparably harmed by lightening|`|Nj58Vi62aa	i think you should ask your hairdresser ! he or she will give you a good answer :) answer mine please !|`|AA11664585	developer is hydrogen peroxide just for hair though. the difference between the numbers is the level of lift it will achieve for you.you dont ever want to put more than 20 on the scalp at least not with out a professional. if you are bleaching, and you are bleaching a lot lighter, you want to go with 30 or 40, but it goes VERY fast so watch it, and if you itch it means you got it on your scalp and dont scratch it!  here is a quick break down. 10 is for lifting 1 level 20 is for lifting 2 and so on 30=3 40=4. you can not lift color that is already in your hair with color! keep all this in mind, and if you have any other questions before you do you hair you should email me and ask, just for your saftey!|`|K2jjYfTWaa	1. Dying your hair blonde might not be a good idea unless it is already blonde.  2. If it is not blonde you will need bleach.  3. Buy the color/bleach you want from Sally's and then the developer you buy has to do with the level of lift you want in your hair. If you want to go 2 levels (say your hair is a level 7 now and you want to go to a level 9) you would need a 20 vol developer. If you want to go 3 levels you need 30 vol and so on. If you are going darker you can just use a 10 vol because you are not lifting the color.  4. My suggestions for color are always the Wella color line. For bleach i would use:   http://www.sallybeauty.com/Prism-Lites-T...  if and only if you have very dark hair or hair that doesn't respond well to color. It is a blue bleach.  For normal color hair i would recommend:  http://www.sallybeauty.com/Powder-Lighte...    Also, the higher the developer the stronger it is. That is why you shouldn't put more than a 10 directly on your scalp but I do it to my hair and its fine.    GOOD LUCK!

P2VFQyZSaa	do your colorology. btw. it is not by the season. you need to read. and pick the one that sounds best like you. then it will tell you the colors that look best on you    Winter    Winter is a cool tone. People with winter complexions have blue or pink/rosy undertones. Skin can be pale and porcelain white, yellowish-olive, or dark. Winters are generally brunettes with deeply coloured eyes. Many Asians and African Americans fall into this category. Natural white-blondes may also be winters.    Best Colours for Winter    Those with the winter colour profile have a lot of depth to their colouring and a lot of contrast between their hair colour, eye colour and skin tone. Winters should wear hues that are sharp, stark and clear. You will look best in intense, rich colours, like black, navy blue, red, and hot pink. These powerful shades will compliment your colouring. For lighter colours, wear bright white or icy pastels, such as like cool blues, pinks and yellows.    Worst Colors for Winter    Avoid dressing in earthy tones and subdued colors like beige, orange and gold. They will make you look faded and ashen.      Summer    Summer is also a cool tone and like winter complexions, the summers among us have blue or pink undertones. Skin is very pale and pink. Summer colouring usually occurs in natural blondes, and even pale-skinned brunettes with pale eyes. If youre a trying to discriminate between winter and summer, winters are usually brunettes and summers are mostly natural blondes.    Best Colours for Summer    Summers have a low level of contrast between their hair, eye colour and skin tone. For you to look your best, choose soft neutrals and pastels, as well as muted colours with cool undertones. Powder blue, dusty pink, mauve, lavender, plum, and pale yellow are all great colour choices.    Worst Colours for Summer    Avoid intense, vivid hues because they will look harsh and drown you out. Nor should you wear earth tones. Stay away from black and orange.    Autumn    Autumn is a warm tone and people with this complexion have golden undertones in their skin, like a pale peach, golden beige or golden brown. Many redheads and brunettes with golden brown eyes fall into this category. However, golden blonde and black hair colouring can also fall into this range.    Best Colours for Autumn    You have a lot of depth to your colouring and skin tone. Rich golden, spicy and earthy colours will accent your complexion. Therefore, look for a warm undertone when selecting a colour. You can wear both muted and rich warm colours that are seen in autumn leaves and spice colours, such as camel, beige, olive, orange, gold, and dark brown. You will also look great in a rich warm grey.    Worst Colours for Autumn    Stay away from clear, bright colours and black and white, which will make your look tired and faded. Also steer clear of pastels and blue tones, which will look cold against your complexion and give you a pale appearance.    Spring    Spring is also a warm tone. People of this complexion have subtle golden undertones and are usually creamy white or peach. Springs have extremely light, ivory skin colour. People of this colouring are usually natural golden blondes, auburn, or strawberry blond redheads. Springs also have very clear, light blue and green coloured eyes. Freckles and rosy cheeks are also characteristics of this group.    If you cant decide weather you are an autumn or a spring, springs tend to have pale eyes while autumns have dark eyes.    Best Colours for Spring    Springs can wear very pale, soft colours, such as peach, camel, golden yellow, golden brown, and aqua. You will also look fabulous in ivory, bright greens, true reds, clear blues and coral.    Your colours may be particularly hard to find because they can never be too muted or too dark.    Worst Colours for Spring    Avoid black and white, which are too contrasting for you. Also stay away from dark, dull colours.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	light colors, Pink, light blue, yellow w/ polka dots.. no black or bright red, they will make you look pale|`|4Q1asqr5aa	try a warm orenge or red to balance your skin tone just stay away from pastels and dark blue or green will look good too|`|jssS7YULaa	Pastels work great for fair skinned, blonde girls.

That way he/she'll be able to look at your current tattoo and be able to come up with artistic ideas to incorporate what you want with what you already have.|`|WR9NuZFiaa	That's something you should discuss with your tattooist. Your tattooist will be your best source on how to put it together. Maybe put the quote under the sun and the butterfly in the middle. Depending on the color and size of both I cant tell you a lot. Talk to your tattooist though make sure your comfortable with the way it look s before getting it.|`|oUdo4kBYaa	the sublime su is awesome lookig google that one hehe|`|JkpyLnfDaa	get the butterfly flying towards the sun   and the quote underneath it all in black script

Have fun with the accessories.|`|fed597f9b6bccbf0dc45d8e8d57e9601aa	Wear a long but warm, thick, fashionable dress , NO REAL FUR, and with rhinstones to die for. Sassy boots with tall heals. Your jewery should be a normal little loop earings, neckless he gave you even if you hate it, and with your fave braclet to match and of course, your wedding ring. Wear just light lip stick or gloss, in the goodness of god non animal tested, and mascar. Don't look to gody, or he won't want to have a 2nd anniversary. Get best cloths from Macy's, JC penny, Sears, or if fancy, Dress Barn. Dress Barn is your best bet unless  you can aford it.

Most people like myself if I flip it last but in a heat for a long period of time it will fall. Curls probable will to if u just do loose ones. Maybe try curls but tight ones, comb out a little and as the day goes by they will fall out naturally and still look good. Bring a nice ponytail holder or pins so if it totally gets blown away it will not be difficult to make a cute pony and still be stylish without a fuss.

d274da12486b976acba03c39ca89cbe6aa	I don't think it will help you much but my friend David rocks the best goth style ever. He LIVES goth...but not the lame kind.    Lame goth = boys with long black hair trying to look like Brandon Lee in The Crow, toting black (faux leather/plastic) pants and covered in metal hooks and chains who who knows what else. girls in corsets that are too small and/or don't fit properly...corsets should make you look amazing not like you're spilling over in all the wrong places.    Good goth = tattoos, dark hair, girls who look like Betty Page or girls with long black dreads (maybe with a little red mixed in, or in special cases pink), dark clothes but NORMAL dark clothes. Suicide girls...although they're more punk than goth...they are VERY attractive.    Damn those Goth kids who just want to be different than everybody else and then complain about their lives!!|`|bcd579b5470241b294acd9a9b0bbef85aa	Goth isn't dead...it just looks like it :)    If you want to see a lot of pictures with tons of examples of gothic style, look up photos from the annual gothic party "Convergence"  Here are a lot to look through:  http://mozai.com/photography/ (click on the right side for "Goth Events")  Here's a good one covering the last 4 (9 through 11)  http://www.matermetis.com/Image/ (particularly 9 and 10)    ...and the list goes on.|`|68ef15bb00d69aa26f101fe2b6c553c2aa	I really like the whole 50's goth look.

9wY0fxqVaa	I live in South Dakota, very average salons here :) haha. Well the salon in town does extensions i have been very interested recently! I could get not my whole head for $400, but i also know the girl. She told me a woman came in a week earlier with shoulder length hair and went out with waist length, she was a stripper, and it costs her $1300. They last for about 6 months though. So if you average it out, about $500 dollars divided by 6 is about $83 dollars a month. It would help the ends of your hair and i mean who wouldn't want thicker, longer hair in a flash right?!|`|eOQjTlvIaa	My sister is a hairdresser for a small salon and she said they can cost up to $800. Depends how many you have etc.
elmXAPCDaa	First outfit: Chic black pants, a flowy top, flats, and dangly earrings. (You might want to wear something over the top.) I also suggested a pair of skinny pants, because that would look good with the flowy top, too.  Second outfit: Cute + fun dress, bright jewelry, and sophisticated shoes.  Third outfit: This outfit is the most casual. It has a slouchy top, skinny pants, and cute boots. (For the cami, I'd wear white, and for the boots, I would probably buy a more simple type somewhere else.)    Hope it helps!|`|k5unIdZmaa	aw this will be fun hold on ok...

qQqC2cHIaa	It means that on the inside of the shirt there's twill tape covering the shoulder seams, staring at the one shoulder point covering the seam, across the collar or neckline seam and over to the other shoulder point. This stabilizes the top of the back of the shirt.  This area, because of the way it is cut to fit the body;  is prone to stretching out of shape with washing and wearing.  The twill tape prevents stretching.  It's means the shirt is well-made.

Pawning is a last-ditch effort to make some quick money. I'd strongly recommend selling them to a jewelry store or getting the diamonds removed and selling them individually.

r9wrDGm2aa	There are two types of relaxers which include:    Sodium hydroxide  Ammonium thioglycolate      Sodium hydroxide relaxers, which are considered to be caustic relaxers, are designed to soften and swell the hair's fibers.   Hair experts consider sodium hydroxide to be more like a hair straightener than a relaxer.    As the solution penetrates into the cortex of the hair, the cross-bonds (sulfur and hydrogen) are broken.  The action of the comb, the brush or the hands in smoothing the hair and distributing the chemical straightens the softened hair.    Manufacturers vary the sodium hydroxide content of the solution from 5% to 10% and the pH factor between 10 and 14.      In general, the more sodium hydroxide used and the higher the pH, the quicker the chemical reaction will take place on the hair, and the greater the danger will be of hair damage.    Because of the high alkaline content of sodium hydroxide, great care must be taken in its use.      Ammonium Thioglycolate:  Ammonium thioglycolate is a chemical compound made up of ammonia and thioglycolate acid.  It is the main active ingredient in both chemical hair relaxers and chemical perms.    Although ammonium thioglycolate which is also referred to as a "thio" is less drastic in its action than sodium hydroxide, it soften and relaxes overly curly hair in somewhat the same manner.      Curling products: permanent waves, etc.    There are 9 ingredients commonly found:  Acrylates Copolymer    Ammonium Hydroxide   Ammonium Thioglycolate    Amodimethicone   Colorants    Fragrance   Polyquaternium-11    Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer   Water
92XIrMC6aa	If you are customizing leather shoes you will want to use Angelus paint. To prepare for this you will need to scrub the shoe with cotton balls soaked in acetone. That will take 40 to 50 cotton balls per shoe. The purpose of this is to scrub off the wax that shoe brands put on their shoes to prevent dirt and other contaminates from sticking on thee shoe so if you dont do that your paint will crack and eventualy peel off. To get angelus paints you can go to turtlefeathers.net. And no you dont need any special brushes or anything like that. :)|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I would go to a fabric store. Look at the paints and see what it says you can use them on. For example it might say it's for leather or plastic, while other paints may only work on paper. So you really have to be careful what you use, and it also needs to waterproof/washable. Just go in to any fabric store and ask pretty much.

Les risques de coups de soleil augmentent d'autant plus que l'ombre est petite.   c'est entre 10 heures et 13 ou 14 heures. Si l'on doit nanmoins tre dehors  ce moment, on s'efforcera de rester  l'ombre ou de se protger avec des vtements, un chapeau et des lunettes de soleil.     2. Vtements et chapeaux  Ce qu'il y a de mieux  faire pour se protger, c'est de porter des habits amples faits d'un tissu serr, c'est--dire arrtant bien la lumire solaire. La plupart des tissus naturels ou synthtiques protgent bien des UV.     3. Crmes solaires  Les crmes qu'on applique localement absorbent, diffusent ou refltent les UV. Le facteur de protection (FP) en exprime l'efficacit. Ainsi, un FP de 4 signifie que la quantit d'UV effectivement re?ue  l'issue d'une dure d'exposition donne au soleil est le quart de celle qui aurait t re?ue autrement.    Frquence des applications  Si les crmes solaires tiennent raisonnablement bien  l'eau, elles ne rsistent pas  l'action mcanique. Il faut en appliquer  nouveau toutes les deux heures environ, en partie aussi sous le maillot de bain, dont l'toffe, avec les mouvements, glisse sur la peau.

Make sure its a female and clearly explain that you would like to try a bikini. Just promise to cover up when you are not in the pool. Your dad will have his reasons but clearly state that you are not wanting to get a bikini for any attention. Your right all you are doing is showing off your stomach but to your dad he may feel that boys may see it differently.

Remember to apply several light coats until you get the level of coverage you want. This prevents creasing!|`|Db9kIaLdaa	Well you should get a liquid concealer that is just a bit lighter than your skin tone and dab it under eyes with sponge applier...i would recomend one from mac|`|aA4XkFopaa	nutrogena|`|ecabdadb9849c91d3437fc76b7b904abaa	use concealor under your eyes, pat the concealor, don't rub, your eyes are your most sensitive area on your face, you don't want to get wrinkles from rubbing too hard.

6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Concealer is used for hiding blemishes, certain imperfections on your face that you want to look clean. For example, concealer is mostly used for under eye circles.<br>  If you wanna have even looking skin color instead of red and blotchy, a GREEN concealer is good for blotchy skin. You can buy the Physician's Formula Concealer Palette (with green, and three lighter tones AND a little brush!) or some of the concealer pens/pencils with green and the concealer of your skin type. <br>  Foundation is for evening out your skin. Some people like to have foundation on because their face is full of imperfections. Others like to have it on because they want the look of a flawless face. Some people have two toned skin! Maybe they're darker on their foreheads, and lighter everywhere else. They wanna match their skin tone, or maybe have their face skin tone match their arms or something. <br>  Foundation isn't recommended if you have like, five pimples on your face that are barely noticeable. That's why concealer is here! :D<br>  Translucent powder is basically a setting powder. If you use foundation (powder/mineral or liquid) it's used to make sure the liquid foundation doesn't run and that the powder/mineral ones stay on if you're extra cautious. <br>  <br>  Ah, since you don't wanna waste your money, for a nice liquid foundation, try Revlon Colorstay (obviously right? It's raved about). Concealer like mentioned before, Physician's Formula. They also have a concealer duo in green and another tone of your choice. Other concealers include Maybelline's Age Rewind Concealer w/ Highlight. Translucent powders like the pressed powder, which is probably from Maybelline, can be found at drugstores. You have to look for that one though, I'm not completely sure. <br>  Good luck and happy hunting!|`|XPDc0H6Haa	foundation is meant to make your skin look even, soft, and pretty much flawless. it comes in either liquid or powder. concealer is to hide blemishes, like pimples, undereye circles, discoloration, etc. and translucent powder is a very light coverage powder to help smooth out your face for when you don't need very much makeup. it also sets foundation, which gives it a nice, matte look and helps it stay on longer. :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped!

5876730689b0fddfc5c8b84b0f3c3396aa	In the picture where you look at the camera head-on, I think you're showing us how you see yourself.  You're not smiling, you look, kind of, well, sad, like you're determined to admit some ugly truth, and also like you're trying hard to see yourself in a negative light, I don't know why.    In that picture, I'd say, at first glance, that you were plain.  Looking closer I'd realize it has nothing to do with the shape of your face or your features, but only the drooping, self-denying expression.  Looking even closer, I find that endearing...  so much pain, so totally uncalled for.  You've got smooth skin, chiselled features, intense eyes.  You could drive women crazy if you knew how to use them.    Looking at the second picture, the one where we can actually see your features? - you're hot.  No lies.  What can I say :)|`|8a8b48ec0eac9f17d57844ea3e451891aa	I think your sad inside to ask this question. You were made in the image and likeness of GOD. Hold on to that.

Allow new shine/growth/strengthened hair shafts to replace those that have been damaged & are brittle.  No hair products can remove or help repair the hair.

Good luck!|`|rJgrwIodaa	Shampoo won't make any difference.  You need a good conditioner.I don't know what they have in the UK, but I think they have Pantene Pro-V deep conditioner.

Id say to get it on your back and wear shirts around them. If you only wear boxers around, that doesnt leave much area to get a tattoo unless you want it on your butt cheek.

But I shouldn't say that because it's not very nice 'cause I know a lot of people have naturally yellow teeth and they can't help it - but brushing your teeth of course reduces a lot of the yellow... You can get it professionally done at your local dental practice and that's probably the best way though some kits such as 'Ultra-white teeth whitening kit' and 'Boots Advanced+ Tooth Whitening Program' are good too...    Good luck!|`|18d7df6ea3c2e224bc5167bd0eb750bdaa	I really like Crest Whitestrips  but here's the main key.  Go to your dentist  (or a clinic,  whatever)  and get a regular cleaning.  That takes off topical yellowing and tartar.  THEN,  use your whitestrips according to directions...and you will really see a difference.  I did.|`|ff7cd52dcb213f2d7552b009bcaeab16aa	Try Crest White Strips Renewal or Crest White Strips Premium Plus.  I have used both, and I love them!  My teeth are whiter than anyone else's that I know.  I saw results after just a few days.  The strips are fairly easy to use and are worn for just thirty minutes twice a day.  Be careful not to overdo it, though.  If you use them for extended periods of time [several months on end] your teeth can start to turn translucent.  This can be fixed, though, by simply allowing some time in between boxes.  Also, this product sometimes causes sensitivity, but it is not typically harmful.  I think you will be happy with the results.  Good luck and enjoy!|`|cbf3a25b22bf622a78c762d6be579aabaa	Use Crest Whitening Strips. They are safe for your teeth and work really well.

Never use soap. You can open your pores with hot compresses (washcloth) For a facial scrub, moisten oatmeal to a "goo", use it to scrub your face (not around your eyes). Wash off with cool water.You may also make a paste of the oatmeal and allow it to dry..remove with cool water.You may also beat an egg white, put it on your face and let it dry, rinse with cool water. Sliced fresh cucumber placed on your closed eyes will reduce bagginess and dark circles.To make your hair shine, rub in some regular mayonnaise,shampoo out after 15 minutes.    2- For an easy exfoliating mask, mix three tablespoons olive oil or any good oil and one tablespoon kosher salt mix and gently rub into dry skin. Do not use around eye area.

AA10523012	Hi there!    I answered your question in the middl east section already. Did you ever take in consideration that not so many european women work here then back home? Women working here in higher positions are nationals and they wear their abayas.    I think the best thing to do in your situation is to make as many private contacts as possible. Have enough business cards on you and pass them out, when you talk about your job and somebody is interested.     Another idea would be to get in contact with different saloons here. If you want, I take you over to mine.    Maybe you can offer your service on the blackboard at Spinney's or Abela's.    I wanted to send you an email, but it's not allowed.

A part le henn(qui fait beaucoup d'allergies), il existe des encres hypoalergniques qui s'utilisent avec des pierres a tatouer. Moi personnellement c ce que j'utilise et je trouve ?a trs pratique. Ces tatouages temporaires tiennent environ 3 jours sur la peau et s'enlvent trs facilement! En plus vu que c un systme de pierre, tu peux refaire le mme modle indfiniment!

8i6HeeEmaa	I'm sure any hair salon that does eyebrow waxing for women would also do the same for men.  If your uncomfortable going to a place like that to have your eyebrows waxed/trimmed you could make a hair cut appt.  there and get your eyebrows done at the same time.    It would be a lot easier for you to keep it up yourself once you've seen how they do it and know what to go by.|`|cHF1uWm2aa	My boyfriend got them waxed and trimmed at Regis.

hhGuTieWaa	If you have really thick hair you could flat iron it first. To keep your hair from frizzing when curling put light moiturizer in it. No GEL!!!! Seperate parts in the back of your hair and have the flapping part of the curling iron up and twist to the right on both sides. Let me now how it comes out.|`|cIYIOZHEaa	you should try to take a picture of it and take it to a hair dresser and they can probably do it for you if they know how?|`|VZzdTUtEaa	uhm curling shampoo or a more expensive curling iron or call Hilary up.|`|ODduTTaBaa	Did you try scrunching it??  Use got2b kinky mousse and scrunch it. It's a curl defining mousse and it will scrunch your hair pretty good. It might not necessarily turn out "curly" but it will be scrunched which is close.|`|YA6lTXOcaa	where have you been since the curling iron came out. this is america. it aint that hard|`|bJMvX5jKaa	If you really want curly hair than you should get a perm that is what i did.|`|0C9JoatCaa	UHHHH. well some people say when i curl my hair it looks like brenda songs...sooo yeah...

COE0YYtKaa	Sounds like you could pull it off with your coloring. I've never colored my hair or anything, but I've heard stories of people who have dyed their hair red after being a blonde & the color has come out orange--I think that it happened to one of my cousins. All I can say is be careful when going from blonde to red.     Also if you want to know what you look like as a redhead, if you have Adobe Photoshop or some similar photo editing software, you could take a picture of yourself, scan it into your computer, create a new transparent layer in the document and paint a red shade over your hair.     Just a note about being a redhead--I don't think a lot of people think about it, but when you're a redhead, you stand out more--a lot more. I've always noticed this and it's not a bad thing--but when you want to blend into to the background and not be noticed, it's nearly impossiable.|`|2Yltg5bJaa	okay well since you said you went blonde.. i think you should try something like strawberry blonde. that color is really pretty and it'd bring out your beautiful eyes!|`|Qj01bpEuaa	that depends|`|z5EDtgtyaa	you should deff try it out cuz if you dont like it you will have to live with it.|`|J2ZCGOdxaa	There are many semi-permanent hair dyes that wash out after about 2 or 3 showers.  Or you could just get a temporary kind of dye.    I would recommend a burgandy brown with some warm tones such as caramel brown or chocolate brown...or even honey blonde.|`|3PWvz623aa	i love the uniqueness of red hair. i say GO FOR IT (permanently)!|`|31bf4899e066de39d29b8411a5503a04aa	Putting any color over blonde hair that has been lightened to that color is a risk, let alone red.  You should have it done professionally so that a filler can be used first to prevent it from fading or grabbing unwanted tones.  Temporary color may actually stain lightened hair a pinkish tone permanently.  Seek a professional.

I think your styller may have good tips too, just ask him/her. goodluck.|`|7a0241347988ca7edbf70c9eec3f24d8aa	No it doesnt. If your face is rounf wavy hair will typically make your face look wider and side bangs will make you fave look shorter. I would go with long loose curls( not waves) that is layered but no bangs!

You can usually get them at the pharmacy.|`|4076fd459952bcea99390eda88e7b664aa	If you're flexible, you should be able to bite/clean your toenails easily.

I hope i have helped!|`|jOrK7ZX0aa	I would use a white cotton sheet.  It's even better if you can find an old one because they used to be thicker.  Another thought is using white polyester. You can't see through it and it won't wrinkle no matter what you do to it. The downside on polyester is that it doesn't breathe like cotton and you will get hot in it. Another upside on polyester is that you can cut it with scissors and it won't unravel. It's a little stretchy, too. So, I guess I'm going to change my answer to polyester. Good luck!

If you don't want to get it cut go to a unisex beauty salon and get them to use a texturizer or S-curl (you may have to buy the products yourself from a beauty supply store and the stylist will put it in your hair). S-curls look really nice on black males. Texturizers make your hair somewhat curly and somewhat straight. S-curls make your hair seem like its "good hair" because it makes your hair curly all over.

CF5ah1QRaa	Each spa and salon is different.  They will all have different definitions of a mini manicure.  However, typically it is a manicure that takes half the time as a full manicure and involves hand soak, cuticle care, hand massage, lotion, and polish.

That is funny.
CF5ah1QRaa	That shouldn't be a problem.  If the hair is too long to laser, they will shave it for you.  You want to continue to shave during the time between your five or six appointments because you want the stubborn hairs to grow so that they can zap them and shaving encourages the hair to grow.  Just keep in mind that laser hair removal is not 100% effective and the hair comes back after a couple of years.|`|j2I5oLE5aa	Plucking (tweezing), Shaving, Depilatory creams and Waxing are temporary hair removal methods. Waxing usually lasts for 3 weeks, but it is painful.

A review of the various hair removal methods is available at http://7ou.info/|`|TvdavOanaa	The place I go to wants you shave within 24 hours of your visit, and no waxing or tweezing for 2 weeks prior.

N0vaK7BLaa	Well, it's because the lips are dry, and I'm sure you've realized this what with all of the chap sticks you use. But here's what you should do on top of that. At night, put vaseline on your lips, it locks in moisture and really helps to keep your lips soft and flake free. And in the morning use a soft bristle tooth brush and brush your lips until there are no flakes. It really does help.|`|4bd1c100273158e739d9e4a2855480d7aa	i hate that too!  it happened alot to me in the past making my lips flake.  i dont know what causes lips to flake but i do know that wearing lip moisturizer helps prevent this|`|tTxR3QQqaa	I had this problem, pricey stuff isn't always the best.

I'm not sure why it works but it just does. I put some distilled water (drinking water but don't put soda or something) on my lips and leave it on for a couple of mins. take a tissue and dab off excecss water. now I use Burts bee wax lip balm. Don't apply too much. and Next I use Loreal Lip Gloss (bubblegum ). If you have excess lip gloss again use the tissue to remove excess.    To do this you just take the thin tissue and place it between your lips and softly close your lips. Don't dab the tissue into your mouth :)    Try it out!! I think u said you already had the Burts bees wax . Trust me its the best chapstick there is out there. Good Luck! :)

8RsgMZ7xaa	oui, je suis une adepte du bio en gnral, et les cosmtiques bio ne co?tent pas beaucoup plus cher que les produits non bios. J'utilise surtout du bio pour les soins du corps: savon et gel douche bio, huile (je varie: argan, amande douce, noyau d'abricot, jojoba...) au lieu des crmes. J'ai aussi une crme bio pour le visage. Je n'ai jamais essay la pierre d'alun, peux-tu me dire si c'est efficace? Pour le do je prends un aux huiles essentielles mais j'avoue que lorqu'il fait trs chaud ce n'ets pas trs efficace. Je n'ai pas encore utilis de shampooing bio. Je t'encourage dans ta dmarche, il est important de protger notre corps ainsi que la plante, la majeure partie des cosmtiques contiennent trop de produits chimiques et ptrochimiques et sont trs nocifs pour tout. Je n'ai pas encore non plus essay le maquillage bio mais ?a ne saurait tarder.|`|KIvxSCYUaa	je commence  acheter des cosmtique bio, mais je ne connais pas encore les bonnes adresses. je me lave plus qu'au savon  l'huile d'olive et de lauriers. je vais essayer la pierre d'alun car j'en entend parl depuis un certain temps et j'ai toujours voulu l'essayer. tu as raison, les crmes chimiques et autres produits cosmtique sont de vrai bombes  retardement et je ne serais pas tonne si dans quelles que annes on  parle  des mfaits de tout ces produits.|`|1b6366cebcb3d3c18fbd085d64ed37d9aa	Bio non mais naturel oui c'est moins cher et c'est pareil,  j'utilise l'argile verte, l'huile d'argan, du henn, du ghassoul...|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	le hnn|`|8bd45c2b051ec9e5b41d45213bea84e0aa	J'en utilise effectivement...

Savon  l'huile d'olive.    Dentifrice  l'aloe vera.    Le shampoing, j'en ai test quelques un, mais actuellement j'en utilise sans dtergent et il n'est pas bio.    ?a pour l'extrieur, mais y a aussi l'intrieur  ne pas ngliger => alimentation quilibre et bio tant que possible, mais c'est vritablement difficile, surtout le midi lorsqu'on est pas chez soi.      Pour finir, on remarque que toutes les firmes de cosmtiques se lancent plus ou moins promptement dans des lignes bio, car elles ont bien identifi le filon...et les drivs de ptrole deviennent de plus en rare (?a coute cher) tout comme les drivs animaux (huile de foie de morue, graisses diverses...). Les rglementations ainsi que les attentes des consommateurs ont tendance  aller dans ce sens.    Je me pose la question aussi du l'aspect quitable de ce march, car on trouve beaucoup d'huile de palme et autre produits qui proviennent souvent de pays en voie de dveloppement.

Oh and I have medium brown hair lol. Don't bother with her.  She just wants to piss you off so that you will do something. It's really a stupid thing to fight about. She doesn't even know you and wants to label you so she's not worth a fight or the time of day to even argue with.

Just keep it clean, but not too clean because if it is too clean it wont heal.

AA12130474	Depends on how daring you are... straight across bangs are something major. It can make your appearance sexy and savvy or it can make you look down right hideous. It also depends on your style. If you dress up a lot... sure... straight across bangs would be for you... but if you like to go casual alot, then no, it would be a disaster... as for color, from you picture you look like you have dark features. If you want some color in your hair, go with coffee colors. Caramel, honey, and honey just to name a few.

AA11892519	okay, well i got mine done a couple of months ago. i live in ecuador, so i didn't have the luxury of a doctor or claire's or walmart or anything, but even then, i still haven't had any problems with mine.   1. i LOVE my piercing....loveitloveitloveit  2. it hurt a little a few hours after i got it. i didn't feel it right after i got it done, and it was a dull sort of ache afterward, but i slept just fine.  3. i got it on the left side. i don't know why, but i just did. and the other girls in my school that have it have it 80% of the time on the left as well. maybe it's for the same reason that guys get their piercings on the left if they're straight? i don't know really. but yeah....left : )  4. it's totally worth it. i have six piercings, doubles on both ears, on the left i have the one on top, and on the right, i have one just above the doubles, but i have to say that my top one is my favorite.  5. i would recommend the doctor. i've never gotten my piercings from a doctor. i've gotten them in ecuador in a small boutique or at walmart : ) they always healed just fine without any problems, but just because i was lucky, doesn't mean that it isn't better to go to a doctor. maybe i'm just too lazy : )  6. my piercing never bothers me, not a bit!  7. you have to get a stud when you first get it done. it's just like a lower piercing. don't they always put in studs? i believe they use the exact same kind of gun. also, even if there was an option, get a stud the first time because they are a million times easier to clean.  8. a tiny silver hoop looks awesome i think, but for the first couple of months, especially if you are prone to infections, use a stud. like i said, they are way easier to keep clean. i personally keep a small silver ball up there. it's classy and matches with anything. i use a small clear back with it as well. but hoops are so much fun!     -i would definitely get it done. i was so scared at first, but i brought a friend with me, and i was eating gummy worms, so the fear wasn't enough to stop me. : ) btw, doing it with a best friend or your mom makes the experience much more memorable and special. ( i got the first four with my mom, and the second two with close friends)   --i really hope this helps you make your decision!|`|46b280af3228ed855e1f73a074d31a97aa	I plan on getting one soon, so I can't answer all of your questions, but I'll answer as much as possible.      1. Yes I like it, it's very cute.    2. I don't know. =(    3. What side do you usually sleep on? If you sleep on your right, get it on your left ear, and vice versa.    4. I think it would be worth it.    5. Definitely a pro. Not Claire's ; they mess up every piercing.    6. .......    7. When you first get it done, you'll get a stud. I don't think they ever start out with hoops for that area unless they're very small.    8. I think that a fairly small, diamond / cubic zirconia stud looks the best.      ? Tiffany|`|QTyZywdfaa	1- i love it  2- like a b*tch. well i got it done on my left side and im a left side sleeper so it took a good 8 months before i was able to change it without wanting to scream bloody murder.  3- i got it on my left  4- i got it by a pro  5- not at all  6- i got a stud but i changed it eventually to a hoop  7- i perfer the hood|`|cgW1vQIzaa	Its excruciating!! coz it goes through cartledge OUCH.  if you do get it done a stud will be better, i think its ugly with a hoop (Be creative).

When they pierced, it hurt ed more than giving birth I think...I don't have kids yet, but I'm sure giving birth doesn't hurt that much...  If you do it, I like left  NOT WORTH IT  it doesn't really matter, as soon everything is sterile  I had it done twice, because I really liked it, the second time didn't get infected, it bothered me sometime, because it itched  you have to wait at least 10 days before putting a hoop on  hoop

After it sets, you have no problem, because you can't get sun burn when the sun sets.

Hope this helps, I'm not sure if all of the stuff will be in stores though|`|1203b7e3688ab3e61c98082d183d1586aa	Get a cute top or polo from A&F in a bright summer color, then get some cute shorts to match from A&F 2.  Then wear a bathing suit under it if you don't have time to change or bring a tote bag which are adorable and just put ur bathing suit in that.  Have funn and don't forget flip flops and sunglasses ?

If it has been more than two weeks might as well forget about it, though in a few months you might get a random call from them.   They take so long because 1) they have a lot of people to look through 2) most jobs do a background check on you 3) Hiring you is not their number one priority (especially at the mall) so they can take the time.|`|145211875f5adee8a13423ca577fcb7caa	Wait a week after turning in an app.  Then call the places you applied & ask if they've had a chance to look over your app & let them know that you're still interested in the job.

You might want to call the manager and follow up to see if they had a chance to review you application.  Also, I recommend that you apply to some other stores.  Make sure that you are dressed up nicely and ask if the manager has time to review your application while you are at the store.  Make sure that you are not visiting at a busy time because they will not have time to talk with you.|`|bgvL2DQWaa	Many employers want to see if you are serious about a job.  If they don't hear from you then they assume you don't want the job bad enough.  The general rule of thumb that I go by is, after a week if the employer has not contacted me, I call them. Ask if the position is filled. If not then tell them when you sent in your resume.  They should let you know right then if you are a canidate for the position or not.  Good luck!

If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions:  Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.  http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...    To hide dark circles, you can use YSL concealer or salmon concealer..  http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com .. tips on how to reduce dark circles, the causes of dark circles, home remedies, eye creams reviews, make up tips, and natural healer.

39UpDJmuaa	you should try and go for pastel colors. those look best on pale skin.  i would go for lilac eyeshadow and brown eyeliner. maybe a very soft pink blush and for the lips, just a clear gloss would look best for every day but if you were to go out or something, i would try a blue-based pink. red-based colors will look too harsh on your skin.  and as for the acne problem- make sure that when you buy foundation it doesn;t contain oil. because oil clogs pores. and try and go for one with some SPF content in it.  that will keep your skin from getting too dried out, causing the body to produce more oil and clog pores- resulting in acne. it will also protect from burning.|`|o4cdY40Taa	I had a terrible acne problem I wanted to show all of my features but I couldn't because i had it everywhere, so I decided that I would try MAC makeup and it works great just go to the mall and tell them your skin problems and they will fix you right up|`|RsC6xdBaaa	Clinique makeup would be good for you.

bxPOLwN2aa	I put Heena in my hair yesteday, left it for two hours, and now my hair is a shiny copper colour (was a dark brown/black).    With Heena, it all depends on what you mix it with, because if you mix it with different items, it will change your hair accordingly, and this also depends on your hair type (I added lemon juice yesterday, and thats why I think this turned out more reddish than normal)    What I would suggest if your new to Heena, is take a strand or few from your hair, and place it overnight in a small sample of your Heena mix, and see how the colour turns out.    Heena, unlike artificial dyes last long ^^    And yes, its a fun thing to do, keeps your hair nice and cool during the summer ^^|`|5dfq7G1Daa	yea.. i've been putting hennah in my hair every 3 months for 5 years now... it works wonders... but only go for it if you have dark hair = black hair or brown hair.. I've heard it dyes blonde hair orange... so yea.. you can do it at home as well.. quite cheap and completely harmless.. even if you get some on your skin it just dyes a little and goes off in a couple of hours.    If you want it to last long and want it go darker... you might want to add black coffee or something called carkatale or something like that.. its arab I belive and makes it last for a LONG time. It makes your hair REALLY super shiny and makes it coppery in color.. really pretty.. sometimes it can even make it slightly reddish.. its got a combo of light brown, dark brown and red together.. really nice. and as for the smell.. it actually smells good.. but i fyou dont' like the smell you could always wash it away with herbal essence shampoo which takes away the smell...

If you want drugstore pencils, try Loreal or Revlon. I got good results with both brands. I found Cover Girl and Mabelline to be too hard and not work well.    Or try a powder liner that you mix with water and apply with a brush. Bare Escentuals liner shadows are fantastic. And, they last forever, so even tho they cost $13.00 they are a good deal.|`|5dfq7G1Daa	haha.. thats funny I had the same problem when I bought a new revlon pencil eyeliner. The trick to get the eyeliner to come out darker is to make sure that the tip is blunt.

IysGGnivaa	Halo Dyah,    rambut yg rontok terus sampai menipis, disebabkan kekurangan vitamin.  cobalah ke dokter atau ke akhli yg dapat memberi advis kepada anda.    saran saya selain memperhatikan vitamin, juga kalau anda mencuci rambut gunakanlah shampoo yg tanpa alkali.  usapkan shampoo perlahan-2 keseluruh kepala, kemudian cucilah bersih-2 juga secara perlahan-2, jangan ditarik-2, sebab rambut anda rawan sekali dengan perawatan kasar.    jaman sekarang tersedia di toko-2 obat suplement vitamin untuk menghadapi rambut rontok.    model rambut yg paling cocok untuk rambut yg sering rontok dan tipis, adalah model pendek setengkuk.  mengapa harus pendek?,  untuk mencegah rambut tidak terlalu berat dan lama kalau lagi disisir.    Dyah, makanlah banyak vitamin yg terkandung dalam buah-2an dan sayur-2an. niscaya masalah anda sedikit demi sedikit berkurang.|`|ae2486c7c749070561bb80ab0a3461b8aa	Coba minum vitamin dan untuk model rambut try to keep it short.|`|El7EKGO5aa	Rambut  bisa menjadi indikasi dari keadaan kesehatan kamu secara keseluruhan. Rambut dari orang yg sehat akan nampak tebal dan bercahaya. Ini karena rambut yang  terbuat dari protein, keratin dan minerals, kondisinya bergantung pd kecukupan nutrisi yang ia terima dari kulit kepala. Jadi diet yang baik dan sistem pencernaan yang baik sangat penting.    Siklus pertumbuhan rambut adalah: fase pertumbuhan diikuti dengan fase istirahat. Setelah fase istirahat, rambut akan mati atau lepas dari kulit kepala. Dan fasenya akan berulang lagi. Normal saja kalau kamu kehilangan 50-100 helai sehari. Tapi sedihnya setelah umur 20 ke atas, rambut kita akan mulai menipis secara berangsur.     Penipisan rambut yang sangat ekstrem bisa terjadi pada pria ataupun wanita. Pada wanita, jarang yang sampai menjadi botak. Tetapi rontoknya lebih merata.    Ini ada tips agar rambutmu lebih sehat.  * Makan cukup protein.  *Kunyahlah makanan dengan baik untuk memudahkan tubuh menyerap nutrisi dari makanan itu.  * Pastikan kalau kamu tidak kekurangan mineral. Yang paling penting untuk rambut adalah zat besi, zinc dan selenium.  * Dapatkan multivitamin dan mineral yang khusus dibuat untuk pertumbuhan rambut.  * Dapatkan silica atau horsetail yang membuat rambut bercahaya dan lembut. (bisa dibeli di toko vitamin dan mineral)  * Makan rumput laut (sumber yang kaya akan mineral)  *Coba relaxation seperti yoga, meditasi atau thai chi (kalau kamu stress) Karena kalau kamu stress, aliran darah ke kulit kepala akan berkurang.  * Dapatkan masas kulit kepala untuk meningkatkan aliran darah ke kepala (di salon/sendiri)    Kalau perawatan dari luar, bisa kamu dapatkan di salon. Atau beli shampo yang khusus untuk rambut rontok. Yang organic rasanya lebih baik.    Untuk model rambut yang cocok, sebaiknya yang pendek dulu. Sebab kalau panjang dan tipis, enggak cantik dong?!

OBWAt82Naa	CONDITION YOURSELF  The irregular shape of ringlets tends to increase the friction among individual strands, so without regular conditioning you can get a lot of tangling and breakage. Use shampoos and conditioners made to define curls and also those that contain heat-activated moisturizers to reduce frizziness from blow drying.     NEVER ENOUGH CONDITIONING  Curls can be difficult to untangle, particularly when wet (when hair is most delicate). A leave-in conditioner or conditioning spray will help separate strands for easier combing. Apply the products with your hands and fingers to get out the larger tangles and knots and then use a wide-tooth comb.     BEST TOOLS  If you think air-drying might give you a more polished, shiny look - you're wrong. Airdrying doesn't give the definition and bounce that curls need. Make an investment in a diffuser, which reduces the air flow to a gentle halo of heat, which also allows you to finger-shape curls for a more controlled look.     SHAPE IT UP  If you're still unable to get your curls under control, maybe it's time for a new cut. A cut with long layers (no shorter than mouth) is usually the key to curly heads. A blunt cut cut result in a pyramid shape and doesn't allow the hair to really move|`|ee63c39b26bb8e6b80cbcadbb6b4b250aa	OMG you have just described my hair!!!! andmy body type, and my face.   and here is my hairapy  Layers ( a little on the medium/long side). Hair curls better when it's cut in long layers. Since i layered my hair, it' never looked better   face shape always matters. If you have a square shaped face, layers will do you wonders. Your curls will soften your features and when you blow dry your hair, the layers will also help soften your features. It's a win win.  My friend has wavy hair and she got side swept bangs and they look great but ask a stylist at a great salon for advice. Thats what i'm gonna do on my next trip to the salon.    SUNSILK SUNSILK SUNSILK!!!!  my hair is wavy when it wants to be and curly every other day. It gets a little frustrating and i dont always have time to blow dry it straight (never flat iron!! it's murder to your strands), so I use their anti frizz and anti pouff products and I deep condition every time I wash with the pink deep conditioner.  when hair is wet add the leave in conditioners (notice plural) and a little JOHN FRIEDA curl enhancing spray and you'll have knockout curls. =)  I garauntee these are the only products that have worked on my hair without drying them out.    I like to air dry because heat will always dry out your strands, or the flowing air will just make my hair even more pouffy. My trick is to add the leave in conditioners and (sometimes) gel and leave it alone. I dont touch it until it'd dry. If you want a part in your hair, part while still wet and let dry in that style.    PS. adding a little gel while its still went wont hurt either when it really humid or windy out. =)

En cuanto al largo llevalo por la rodilla o un poko ms abajo...no te aconsejo tipo minifalda para una boda. Los zapatos pueden ser de tacn en un color liso acorde con el vestido. El tacn ni muy alto ni muy bajo y preferiblemente que sean acabados en punta ya que no me pega uin zapato abierto con una boda. Como complementos puedes llevar unos pendientes tipo "perla" de color liso y un colgante discreto pero bonito.Ponte algn anillo pero tampoko no muchos. Como supondras el bolso acorde con los zapatos y si puede ser un bolso peke?o pero elegante. En cuanto al maquillaje usa uno que no sea muy llamativo: usa una base muy suave de tono moreno con un poco de colorete pero solo un pokito. En los ojos puedes darte una base de color muy suave y un poco de rimmel para darle presencia a las pesta?as. La barra de labios tiene que ser suave en un tono marrn que realze tus labios naturales.

AA11625624	1. Put toothpaste on your pimple before you go to bed, should help reduce swelling overnight. Make sure it is the paste not the gel. One of the most popular acne home remedies.     2. Wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the acne.     3. Apply a paste of fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves over the face every night for 10-15 minutes and washed with warm water. This will prevent acne, pimples, blackheads, and wrinkles.    4.

Check out  http://useinfo-blackhead.blogspot.com/ for more useful tips to control blackheads.|`|3db0dfea48251373f0ba1edcb6e76564aa	Yeah, that happens. Daily oils and dirt clog pores. That just happens, it's not unusual.  Trying to push them out can actually cause more blackheads because you wind up pushing stuff over into other pores that clog up because of it. Plus, you start to damage your skin and cartilage regardless of whether you use tissue paper or not.   Try getting some facial wash with moisturizer that can balance out the skin and keep your skin from overproducing oils. And just keep your face clean . Try not to rub or touch your face during the day. You may not realize how much you actually are toucing it.  After washing, when drying off, try patting your face instead of rubbing it.   Apart from that, see a dermatologist. They can often help remedy things better.|`|evFusZwiaa	talk to your doctor|`|01oRNHuNaa	Buy a blackhead remover (local drugstore, near the tweezer and nail clippers), then after you remove the blackheads, clean the area with a little rubbing alcohol to kill the bacteria.  (Clean the blackhead remover tool, too.)  The problem is probably that once you get the blackhead out, more dirt, oil and bacteria just find their way right back into the nice open pore you've created.      People are gonna freak and tell you not to use alcohol on your face cuz it'll dry your skin, but really, it'll kill the bacteria causing the blackheads to pop up again, and trust me, it's not gonna kill YOU.  Just don't rub it all over your face all the time.|`|xunzkeofaa	Cleanse the face thoroughly with a good cleanser meant for oily skin. Preferrably use a salicylic acid cleanser.    Apply an astringent like witch hazel. It helps reduce oiliness. If its a bit harsh mix a bit of rose water in it.     Apply a good quality medicated cream or gel containing resorcinol, salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. This helps is soaking the oil and helps in peeling away the blackheads. You can get creams or gels of Benzoyl Peroxide treating blackheads If benzoyl peroxide leaves your skin dry, apply an oil-free moisturizer after 10 mins of applying benzoyl peroxide.     Effective Tips to get rid of blackheads     ?Exfoliate the blackhead prone area 3-4 times a week using facial exfoliators and scrubs.     ?Use creams containing AHAs (Alpha Hydroxy Fruit acids) like glyco-creams that will clear away any dead skin cells and "expose" the blackhead. Use the AHA's every 3 days or so.     ?Avoid washing the face with soaps more than twice a day. Instead wash your face often with plain water splashes.     ?Often use a mask with a clay base.    If blackheads look ready to pop out, you could try removing them gently by using a blackhead extractor. Also, Pore cleanser strips (blackhead extractor) for removal of blackheads are highly recommended for the treatment/removal of blackheads. Using them once per week will leave your pores cleaner and smaller.     Steam your face to soften both the skin and the material blocking the pores.     =)
ghJdGSeBaa	looks good and ur very pretty! lol|`|GCsMcKOPaa	i think it looks really nice and natural,  i cant even imagine the red  (:|`|b6LcC0CEaa	You look like more of a cool toned skin tone than a warm toned...could just be the lighting.. the orange/red may wind up clashing with your skin tone. Light hair on dark skin can be done though. Get used to it and see if you like it : )|`|0sDjlH5aaa	Hard for me to imagine what you looked like before, but you look pretty in that picture, and your hair too.|`|AA12036090	Yes!!!! You are very pretty! It looks great! go you!
5jWLurR8aa	It is a very very bad fake. I wouldn't buy Louis Vuitton from Craigslist, they are all fake. The biggest giveaway is the hanging tag, but the leather on the handles is the wrong colour and it just looks cheap.    Don't buy it!    And to one of the posters above, the Speedy IS meant to have the monograms upside down on one side, it is made out of one piece of material.|`|5899a5d6cb30e586ae0b879a09def825aa	OMG! That's so fake.  LV bags doesn't come with the leather tag.  Even the pattern on the wallet is all wrong.  $100 price means fake, fake, fake!|`|Ov9qM1gdaa	100% fake.  LV does not put tags on their bags....ever.  LV does not put plastic around the handles....ever.  Think about it plastic and leather???  Plus the color of the leather is off.  If you want to see real LV bags go to eluxury.com|`|xcEWVJB0aa	uhm it looks fake the LV design is UPSIDE Down on the bag hahahahah i wouldnt get it !!!!|`|rtKUTVL4aa	The pictures are kind of blurry, but from the looks of it, it looks fake. My sister likes to buy the fakes for 20 dollars and they look just like that. From the pictures it looks cheaply made. I wouldn't get it.|`|uErrs4Zfaa	Haha, that is one of the worst looking fakes i've ever seen.   First of all, Louis Vuitton does not attach tags to their handbags. That and the plastic wrapping around the handles is quite cheesy.   Also, it just looks cheap.   Here is a real one:  http://www.eluxury.com/estore/browse/pro...|`|psAbFL6kaa	100% fake.  Louis Vuitton NEVER has tags attached.  I collect LV bags, and I only buy directly from the LV stores.  I didn't even look closely at the picture...as soon as I saw that cheap leather tag hanging off it I knew.|`|4EeemlTwaa	well i would have to go with fakeee... but i m not sure|`|M81w8h99aa	well i depends on how it looks if the fake 1 looks fake then real but if it looks reall go 4 it ull save money 4 somethin hoter:]|`|jtTaRTSeaa	cant tell from the pictures. it looks real. look at the serial number on the inside tag you can tell better by that.|`|RFQTnf3yaa	I highly doubt it!  A brand new Louis Vuitton at $100?  How does 'craig', if that is his name make the money on that if it was real?  I've been overseas and seen the fakes and they look very similar to the real thing.  There are some indications as to a fake but you can't tell from the photos.|`|2pxiPgYXaa	100% FAKE!!!
yO55x9raaa	i dont have a pic  but i actually do know someone with dirty blonde hair and light blond highlights.  its really cute,  it almost makes you look like a naturel blonde,   i absolutely love it on her.  especially when she straightenes it.|`|4EeemlTwaa	yeahh they do  thats how i had my hair like past year & it looks pretty & your hair looks alot blonderrr.|`|7rcZ9I4Paa	i think it would be gorgeous.  depending on how dark and light your hair is now.  but it nothing drastic so its not going to look horible.

4EeemlTwaa	well theres park ridge  it borders chicago on the northwest side  but thats pratically like the subarbs  theres a metro right there if you get a hotel right next to the high wayy  it s not loud b/c i live on the other side of the highway like a few blocks away.    theres like 3 hotels in the area  one is on the chicago side of the highway  i m not sure of it s name b/c they always change it     but the metro/train/subway whatever you call it is just across the street and if can take you stright to downtown.|`|gWleYSuIaa	Dalian China is far outside of Chicago|`|9f984e44ac45ea97d8ddb9d8cad84772aa	Well being a native, I can tell you that the "chicago land area" is much more crowded then the city itself. If you are coming from Des Moines you can take I80 in. This will bring you to the south side. Depending on your comfort level you can stay locally there (Like Alsip) & take a train in. If you want a little less diverse crowd, then you may want to go a little NW to say Oak Park.    I have traveled a lot & Chicago is by far one of the most user friendly cities to navigate. It is split up N,S,E,W so for example State Street being the E/W line, if you see Halsted (800 W) you know you are 8 blocks (each block is 100) west of state street. So say you want 608E Michigan Ave, you want to be 6.8 blocks east. If you see 700E (each interestion is marked) you went to far... If you see 200W you are going the wrong way so turn around.    I know this is not really your question. But if you have a little time, you may want to do a search on navigating the city of chicago & drive it. You will see it is rather easy and not 1/2 the headache of taking a train to Union Station & trying to figure it out on foot (or letting cabs rip you off cuz they know you are a tourist). If you still want to train in. Then DONT act like a tourist (dont say you are from out of town or anything). Be very confident & tell them where you want to go. If you are walking it... Do not look up amazed at all the big buildings. It screams tourist & every begger, riff raff is gonna know it & hassle you. LOL If they do, dont be nice, cuz we are not nice people here ;)|`|0IYb5EMcaa	stupid, stupid, STUPID question. why cant anyone be so specific at askin a question. bastards

They look like a dopy guys underpants! lol|`|pLPhktACaa	I do like the shorts, but even when they are on sale, you will probably end up spending less on a pair, or several pairs, of Soffe shorts. Also, I do like the tank top, but if you want something less sheer, you should try Sugar Lips tank tops, which are available at National Jean Co. and other boutiques. They are around $20.00, but totally worth it and they last forever.|`|vwJoWchSaa	Yeah for the gym they'd be good.

Drinking lots of water will keep your hair healthier, so I would try that.|`|HNuBmownaa	nothing.  just eat healthy things and don't inflict damage on your hair (hair straightner, hair dye, curler) becaus eit makes your hair break at the ends.    i easily get an inch a month normally.|`|GVgR0cVJaa	i heard the vitamins women take when there pregers do wonders for the nails and hair.....or you can just get your hair trimmed ever 3 month and that should keep it healthy and growing
skI02ew9aa	It is not recommended to smoke after getting your tongue pierced, but if you do, you should just clean it thoroughly and it should be fine.  After getting it done, you will talk like an absolute idiot, and you tongue will swell a lot.  It will be very hard to eat, and you might accidently chew on the barbell from it being too long, but after it heals, you can replace it with a shorter one.|`|GpFMJWzbaa	You can still smoke, but you need to use Listerene every time you do, and also every time you eat, drink, or stick anything in your mouth. It takes a couple of weeks for the swelling to go away. I took my piercing out b/c it was annoying and I kept chewing on it which hurt my teeth. But that's just me. Smoke a light cigarette, and limit how much you smoke per day until it heals. If you can't keep up with the care of your piercings, then don't get pierced. Also, make quadruple sure that the equpiment is sterile. If you have a bad feeling about the facility, chances are you're right. Go somewhere you're comfortable with. A good artist will give you care instructions and tips to reduce your infection risk. A good artist will also be willing to answer any questions or concerns you may have.

They're very bad quality.     the juicy bag seems a good idea. Sorry, but as a 14 year old I don't think you should invest in something like chanel. Wait for a chanel bag when you're a little older because you may not like the style you've chosen now.    The juicy bag is super cute -great choice! I asked my own Mum for this back in november, but then decided to get a DS lite and some games since I've got quite a few bags already.    The jewelry might be nice. Ask for Louis vuitton earrings, since bracelets might not fit you the same way five years from now.     Try these earrings -my friend got them and I adore them!  http://www.eluxury.com/estore/browse/pro...      I'm just suggesting you wait on a chanel bag... I'm helping my sister pick out a Louis vuitton bag because she's only 15 and might choose poorly. There's details like when a Louis bag with lots of brass buckles gets older, the brass turns a very disgusting brown-green and can be difficult to treat. Ask for jewelry or the juicy couture bag.     And happy 14th birthday!|`|CPJLFlhhaa	Juicy.|`|IPravDhbaa	channel all the way!

4EeemlTwaa	usee   like the stuff you put in your hair before you straighten itt   the spray i use is called  aquage  it s really good & it comes in a blue metal bottle  it really helped my hair over the past few weeks it s not as dry & dead looking when it s straightened anymore=]|`|cdUyUMrOaa	there is only one way u can get a perm that way u don't  keep straighening it cause heat protection only works on some hair|`|0c6c73382098f545ce46bef3dd619b2caa	Please, please give your hair a break. Straighten twice a week at most!!!    The rest of the time, i suggest french braiding your hair the night before, then using the Tresseme curl rejuvinating spray the next morning.    Also hot oil your hair once a week. (I use vo5)|`|58ZnWeIFaa	Use something in it before you straighten it.  use a thermal heat protecter  and then you should be fine!|`|3fuOEOMPaa	I used to have DEAD on straight hair too, but like you I started straightning it and then it got all frizzy.    Try John Frieda's product Friz-Eze the gold bottle  It says something like Heat transform on it?  I can't remember the exact name right now  But it works like MAGIC! I swear by this stuff.  You can buy it at stores like CVS, Walgreens, Target etc.  Hope I helped.  :D|`|32dOHpBDaa	well, straighten your hair is never a good thing but , I do it to,,, so what i do is just make sure that you get it trimmed every now and then, and to use conditioner,  also you can buy special types of straighteners that don't ruin your hair, good luck :)|`|tsEwXgl5aa	Well to protect my hair I use Tresemme Thermal Creations, it works real well. They also have a whole line of products for just that type of thing...for the spray i got it was only a few bucks, so its not that bad.     Also...put in some serums into your hair after you get out of the shower or when you style it. Serums feel extremly weird on your hands but it really helps. To make my hair super shiny i use Garnier Frutise Sleek and Shine serum.|`|L2h0y2eCaa	I would try not to straight iron alot, as it will damage your hair. If you must do it, do not use the highest setting. Use a lower setting..even if you have to go over the hair over and over...its better to do so at a low heat setting. Also, you can try Silk Elements Heat Protectant spray. It is formulated for ethnic hair which usually requires higher temps from flat irons.
4EeemlTwaa	i think it s fineee     and  i do think guys like it|`|SLs1BLzxaa	its great to be curvy.   much better than being 15 and square like me!  the thing is, we all have problems with how we look, even the most gorgeous girl in teh world is bugged by her nose or her stomach or her toes! its normal to feel conscious about how you look, everyone does! just remember that to look GOOD, you have to feel good about yoruself, if youre all day thinking im an ugly slob then soon everyone else will start to see it too.   besides no ones teh same! and nowadays people have learned to love teh differences that bring people together! may it be curvy, skinny, fat, tall, short!   love your curves and rock em for what they are and duh, guys love curves   :)   hope i helped|`|hGteO5Rfaa	Yes!

Just be happy with yourself.|`|9ZJn15Ipaa	guys looove curves.  curves are beautiful so embrace what you got|`|M6oRpCPJaa	Its fine I if a guy only likes you because the way you look then he is crazy anyway :) your body description sounds like mine ?|`|Ta5B9OZeaa	the curvier the better :)|`|SWdoYMwRaa	Guys will love those curves. Skinny girls are very, mainstream and expected now. Size 7-9 sounds kinda cool, and it means you definately have hot guy potential still. Guys will love your butt I'm sure!|`|GQXTa3Wdaa	I personally think that it is okay to be a little curvy.  From what I hear from other guys that they prefer "a little meat on the bone". Ask yourself this: Are you happy/satisfied with your weight and size? If so then there ya go, just be comfortable in your own skin.  Or if you think you need to tone up or loose a few pounds then just watch more of what you eat and do extra workouts.  So basically I'm saying "who cares what other people think of your body size"  it's all about feeling good about yourself .  Like for example...I am 5'4 and weight is 112lbs. I hear all the time how thin I look and my father in-law says" I look like a poster child for aids".  I think to myself did I ask you? and if I gain a little it will be because I felt the need to do so, not because other people think I need to gain a little.  Anyways you know what I'm saying.....just make YOU happy and the heck with what anyone else may think.  Hope that helps some.
fea58e1de311319100dad00526083729aa	i usually put mascara on before, that way you don't have to worry about having to re-curl them if they go straight while you are applying mascara.|`|fzQIZPCTaa	i prefer to curl them after i put on the mascara, and then put on an extra coat to hold them there. although, it can pinch and lately i've been curling them before i put the mascara on.  also, if you curl them after you've put the mascara on already it'll get mascara all over your curler & you'll have to clean it off more which is annoying.  so, either way.  whatever floats your boat.|`|bz8zd4caaa	Curl first otherwise the mascara could clump or even cause lashes to break (egad!)|`|LOZ6jpoRaa	I do it after a thin coat. I think it stays more that way, then i add more mascara.    my mom always told me to do it before though, claiming i will rip my eye lashes out..  that has never happnened to me tho.|`|AA11130296	curl your lashes first, otherwise your mascara will stick to your lash curler.    also, if you heat your eyelash curler with your blowdryer first, it will help them curl.|`|3IxqAyAGaa	before mascara bc it will make ur lashes will break off        Wanna try answering my friend's question? 10 points for best answer  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|3mxkMxqBaa	after|`|G61RoRPaaa	after, curling with mascara on will make them clump together|`|6VZEdJ9iaa	after cuzz it darkens them and clumps|`|0lEbZbW8aa	you should put mascara on after you curl your eye lashes. that way the make up doesn't come off, plus it's not as easy to curl them after they already have mascara on them.|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	Curl them first.. then apply the mascara..This way they don't get stuck together and you wont have the "tarantula look"  u know what i mean?..................    Tip- to help separate your eyelashes while applying the mascara AFTER you curled the eyelashes turn the blow drier on COOL and LOW don't point the air directly into your eye but keep it close enough (your comfort level) and this blows the lashes upright and really helps! :O) They look so pretty and don't come out clumpy :O)|`|4EeemlTwaa	afterrr, b/c thats the way your supposed to do it.   so  1. curl.  2. mascara.|`|Mda8Uv9Vaa	After.|`|9DNxiJcoaa	u should curl then apply mascara..   if you put on mascara first,  it makes your eyelashes sticky and if they get stuck in the curler, they could get pulled out     ((ouch!!!))      ?sc|`|rHgwzSUWaa	after you curl them. that way you don't take off the mascara with it|`|kPRDf56Aaa	After, because then your mascara gets on your curler.|`|AA12035457	Definately after.  If you do it before...it increased the risk of breaking them off.|`|WrYyjAhfaa	Definetely after. It makes it easier to apply and it saves time.|`|nbN9NrObaa	Noo! never put mascara on first! it will make your lashes clump!! Curl them by pumping your curler 3 times on each eye and them apply mascara. I find it best to apply 2 or 3 coats of mascara for a more dramatic look.|`|bTyzHnlkaa	I would always curl them b4 i put mascara on, bcuz u get mascara on the curler, or u completely clump ur lashes 2gether.|`|yttEKf5Taa	Definitely before. Otherwise your mascara may get clumpy if you do it after|`|cd4b70135ea2f22376806caa0b1dcccdaa	I suggest after becuase if you do it before you'll rip your eye lashes of you lid not all at once of course lol but still you'll pull them off.|`|yDhrB5Pfaa	curling your eye lashes is bad as it is, but NEVER CURL THEM WHEN YOU HAVE MASCARA ON.  it causes them to break off|`|IS1MBpieaa	after!  omg! one time i did it before and it pulled out my eye lashes!! =[   hah it sucked.  you dont wanna do that  and u wont take the mascara with you.|`|NAbbM5GAaa	after because if you curl them with the mascara already dried on , it can break your lashes and sometimes rip them off.|`|kM7lFbpFaa	what i do is curl mascara and then curl again then i touch it up with mascara it usually stays through out the whole day.  hope this helped :]
Jo8HrEh0aa	No that looks fine!   What you wear also depends on the style of the bar.  Some bars are way dressy, some are rocker bars, some are techno, depends on the club. I live in Vegas where I go to clubs all the time, that is what a lot of girls where. =)|`|6f90f9cb0871e5afcb315ff1e1517f86aa	You can never be too dressy, as anything goes.  But it must go with your mood!!!!  Or it will not work!|`|gny47DLUaa	I don't think its too dressy.  this style is also kind've the trnd right now, so....|`|c166857a77816fc01eb605cef5e0a788aa	no but guys will try to put their hands up your dress so wear spandex under it...I NOTICED YOUR NAME WAS EMILY T...THATS MY NAME TOO!? weirrrrrd hahaha|`|pwY45Jz5aa	umm thats ugly stuff|`|Hs5hq0koaa	its cute, not to dressy!
dsEDNvAcaa	try both, they work differently for different people so you never know. they basically have the same ingredients anyways|`|b3532db70f45af9e0861017ebadbea02aa	clean and clear!!!  its the 2nd best acne product other than Proactive.|`|fP05qJ26aa	clean and clear is ok but i prefer proactive.|`|DDCwNkC7aa	I peferably like both. I use Clean and Clear products though, and they work ah-mazingly! You should buy those instead of Neutrogena!  Hope this helped you!  :D|`|DIvX3zPLaa	I have never used clean and clear products, but I use the orange face bar from neutrogena, and I don't get near as many breakouts that I did before I used it. I've been using it for a year now|`|HUSwhc1xaa	I definately prefer clean & clear, and they hav a lot of different products to choose from.  Try the Steam in the shower stuff it works soo great i love it|`|oFcwXqNFaa	I dont know how neutrogena works but when I use clean and clear It does nothing and it drys my face out.|`|ib0rq8tZaa	both are really great! but what i did was mix their products up. so like, i use neautrogena make up, and clean and clear cleansing products. but if you don't wear make up, i would suggest trying both of them for a period of about a month each. then decide which is better. because they work completly differently on everyone.

4EeemlTwaa	i think you should ask this in the nashville section.    anyway look in the yellow pages and ask around your high school
fzByWPpcaa	You could try emu boots, they're similar to uggs. They sell pretty much everywhere, where ever they have uggs they have emu. Not sure if they still sell them tho (boots in general), at least not where I live since its now spring.|`|FyNyd6fDaa	air walk  they're from pay-less but they're cute.  and they really do look like uggs.|`|bhOiEMvpaa	I love Uggs and everything like them (BearPaws, Emus, Koolaburras, Chookas, Acorns, Aussie Dogs, etc.) but isn't a little late for Uggs? Its almost April.|`|4EeemlTwaa	fuggss!!!    lmfao like Fake uggs=fuggs.    and i guess anywhereee. since there fuggs.|`|7BP7Y9ntaa	honestly i bought 2 pairs at charlotte russe.. they are cute an look like ugs an were no joke like 30 bucks.|`|1yo10Snmaa	just buy real uggs|`|3ccde3da8d3f60f6fec138b2fe16129daa	There are Emu's     they are australian too.|`|2uD9MQN5aa	target for 12$ and they look just like em|`|j2gKqSg5aa	The ones from costco look exactly like them, but they're around 40 bucks.
jhYbcLETaa	I think that it's okay to put on make-up and do your hair, but it's the girls that wear too much make-up, and who look fake, who people consider ugly. But yeah.. I always straighten my hair!|`|b9LclO15aa	I know this probably isn't what you are looking for but i think its good (im a girl btw) when girls don't wear a lot of make up during the day (like at work etc), but when they go out with friend etc make a effort to look night. Otherwise its like tooooo much. And also if you just do when you go out people will be like 'Wow you look good tonight'.|`|GT09sc9saa	I have been told I am pretty, and yes I need and wear make up daily-it only helps, and not tons! It sounds like that girl is trying to hard. Less is more. It makes me feel better about myself too.  I don't think wondering and worrying about your looks is shallow. If you take the time to make yourself up, it means you care and that's pretty.(don't forget your eyebrows!!!) I hope this helped a bit.|`|TocnWrfuaa	Yeah I was thinking about that to.. I'm one of those girls whose boyfriends or future husband have to accept that they would have to wake up to a monster of the deep ocean when they wake up next to me because I admit I look like CRAP without makeup or my hair done (I have bad bad skin with alot of small blemishes and my hair is really unruly).  Pretty really is a matter of perception in terms of relationships.  Someone can be hot without makeup etc, but if they're cocky about their natural beauty and rely only on their beauty for everything than that's stupid.. and in terms of relationships, if guys only want a girl who is naturally gifted without always needing makeup or who expects girls like me to make myself up for them everytime I see them, than they are just as vain.  There are guys out there who like you for you and who might hesitate the first time they see you without your makeup and madeup hair, but if they truly only care about that, about what the rest of everyone else thinks about him being with some girl who can't have the energy to make herself up all the time for him (if he's attracted to you, he should be attracted to YOU personality and everything, not what other people think), then they truly are conceited and shallow in my opinion... especially if they keep commenting on it or something haha...  Yes physical attraction is important relationship wise, but I personally don't want to slather on makeup if I'm going to go to friggin.. McDonalds with some guy or something one afternoon haha.|`|lFimBIfiaa	it's okay to use makeup and have nice hair...beauty is only skin deep...there are a lot of stars who are not naturally pretty at all...maybe the girl you see that wears a lot of makeup probably isn't naturally pretty...the main thing is to have self confidence and that makes a person beautiful no matter what...so just smile and embrace yourself :-)|`|aaE5SvBHaa	if you put on sooo much makeup that when you take it all off you have a grey pigment to your skin then i think that's ugly. cake'd make up is ugly and fake. soft makeup and barely there make up is ok. yes ur still pretty if u still do daily maintenance, it's healthy, but don't do it to impress others, do it to make urself feel good and healthy.    i knew this one girl [well alot of girls] in high school, they were pretty and wore make up and thought they had perfect skin, but a few days i've seen them without their make up and well they literally looked like zombies. they had no color and looked terrible. from then on i did not think of them as pretty anymore...    but prepping urself is good, but don't get fussy over it. if one day u have a bad hair day or just can't get the 'look' [whatever the look is] right, just shake it off and have fun. that will show ur inner beauty.|`|6QhJ7SW8aa	I belive every girl is pritty and if you dont think that then you are shallow. No one is ugly and if you think that anybody is then your the ugly one. Not you personaly but to everyone generaly.|`|sdjljoNMaa	Hmmm well i guess this subject is subjective to individual! However i still agree to this saying that there are no ugly girls, only lazy ones so have more confidence alright? ;D First impression is important but last impression is the best! So i guess pretty character would make you pretty in a way :)    Well i just feel there is a disadvantage being physically very pretty for girls at times for you tend to attach guys that want you for pleasures instead of you know...    All the best! come on self confidence!!|`|4EeemlTwaa	omg i agree with everything you said !!   so yeah i m like okay looking with makeup  but if i do it good i do feel alot better & have more confidence.|`|yes27GzYaa	everyone is pretty if they are NEAT, CONFIDENT, ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE SENSED|`|q0KnPbzRaa	I think that make up should just be used to emphasize your features...eyes mainly...not to change how you look...  If someone is being complimented when they have make up on...and they look totally different without make up...then that's something different.  Also...everybody has their own perspective on beauty...some people make think a certain person is beautiful...and some may not.  It depends on the person's taste.  So there will always be people out there who will think you are beautiful, cute, sexy....we all have different tastes  (some like red roses, some people like sunflowers)
dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	I'm a full-time barefooter so I don't wear UGGs or any other boots, but I do eat meat and I also feed my cats canned food. It doesn't bother me at all that UGG and other companies use the hide of the animal me & my cats are eating and make boots, jackets, bags, couches and other leather products. In fact, it would bother me more to know that the inedible parts were thrown out and wasted. If we're going to raise animals for slaughter, we should treat them well when they're alive, and use all of it and not waste.    As such, I am opposed to raising animals just for their fur like sable, foxes, mink etc. First of all they're kept in very small cages lacking any shelter so their fur gets thicker than it normally would if they had a good lair to sleep, and second they're killed *only* for their fur. You describe the process of preparing the skin, but as far as I know sheep are consumption animals and the rest of the animal is processed for food as well. Also, as far as I know they're kept on wide ranges, allowed to graze and walk free until they're big enough to be slaughtered. Now *those* two things are what concerns me about keeping farm animals. If you have more information about those matters, feel free to post about it. The tanning process is interesting but isn't really proof of how the sheep are treated or if it's a matter of serious waste.|`|plGuYnNDaa	Alright.. I love my UGGS and ya do you have a leather couch? Do you have leather boots? Leather anything!! Even rubber...Do you eat meat?!? Ita ALL the same!!! I love animals dont get me wrong but if you are going to tell poeple to stop wearing UGGs you would have to stop like evrything so i just think people need to stop this!! Like honestly animals are used for pretty much anything.. SOrry but i know what your talking about..|`|4EeemlTwaa	yeah sorryy i know i know i know  they have to kill sheep for this but i love my uggs  & i wanna get the tall ones next year like for thanksgiving.|`|0GZwsEgfaa	i have uggs idont like killing sheep but they kill em anyway  might as well by them. Its hard to live without animals. I would die if i couldn't eat meat or have anything animals produce.
