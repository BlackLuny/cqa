20090202154356AAyCnnE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	**Do you think Harry Potter has ruined it for writers wanting to write about magic?	She seems to have covered just about everything in the 7 books. A government (ministry of magic), laws (misuse of underage magic), departments within the ministry, sports on broomsticks, owl post, wizarding shops, Potions classes, Defense against the dark arts classes etc. It seems a bit difficult to maneuver around all these things. Is there anything left to write about when approaching the topic of wizarding schools?         Do you think HP has ruined it for writers wanting to write about wizards? (especially boy wizards?)

20090202160953AAWjfKz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How's this for an opening paragraph? ?	Haven't written in ages so I'm quite rusty, this is my second attempt at writing an opening paragraph. I need people to tell me my mistakes and if this would catch your interest or not.     Blood roared in my ears and ice cold air pierced my lungs. I was being chased by several trained warriors who were all after my blood. I was already running as fast as I could, but the distance between me and the warriors was slowly shortening. I had already abandoned my sword a while back. It was just a dead weight considering I couldnt fend of five, maybe more, warriors. Faia! someone shouted my name from not too far away. Relief swept through my body, but quickly vanished. An arrow flew past my head, missing me by a hair. Panic seeped through my tired body and my knees started to buckle underneath me. Stay strong! I mentally screamed at myself, pushing myself up and sprinting in the direction of whom ever called my name.

He notices, of course. It's painful, but it's like a symbol.    I'll leave the story behind it to myself..   But is this idea lame? :(

Writing a paper on this poem and am looking for points to write about.      MYTH      Long afterward, Oedipus, old and blinded, walked the   roads.  He smelled a familiar smell.  It was   the Sphinx.  Oedipus said, "I want to ask one question.   Why didn't I recognize my mother?"  "You gave the   wrong answer," said the Sphinx.  "But that was what   made everything possible," said Oedipus.  "No," she said.   "When I asked, What walks on four legs in the morning,   two at noon, and three in the evening, you answered,   Man.  You didn't say anything about woman."   "When you say Man," said Oedipus, "you include women   too.  Everyone knows that."  She said, "That's what   you think."      By Muriel Rukeyser

You're not allowed to choose MLK, Stalin, Hitler, or Nelson Mandela because we already studied them. Who should i do? And if you had to choose who would you do?   I think i might do someone involved in the russian revolution or communist russia because that really interests me, maybe Lenin?   Who would you choose and why?

It takes from a second to a day. It hits hard. Before you can realize what’s happening, it’s already done. It is like striking a match. One second its plain, the next a fire is roaring. But death works differently. One minute, one day, or maybe one second, it is roaring with fire, or life. But then the fire is blown out, and the match is burned. Death is quick. Death is thoughtless. Death takes no thought, and robs you of all of it. Robs you of everything.

PONDERING SLUMBER      In the soft shadows before dawn   When it is not yet day    Nor is it night   The stars slowly turning out their lights   My pulse quickens as i awake from my slumber   My mouth dry and grit in my eyes   The world is silent waiting to be awoken   Buds of flowers slowly uncurling   I wonder what the new day will bring   As i lay in my slumber   My mind begins to ponder   Do others think as I?   Can we think without a thought?   Can we reason without a reason?   Can we love without being loved?   I stretch my limbs as i ponder,   A new day something new to wonder   Yet there is one thing i am certain   And will always remain clear,   That in my end of days,   When my years are numbered   I will be happy for what i know,    And happier yet for what i dont.
20090202220926AA7Z0lp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Did Edward feel any sympathy toward Rosalie after she was raped when he could hear her thoughts?	Do you think he did?   I know he didn't like her. Rape is a traumatic thing and it would be hard enough to go through it, but to hear someone else relive it in their mind and cry about it and think 'could he (that random stranger on the street) do that to me too?' especially after it first happened, I know Rosalie was depressed and I know it was always on her mind.    How do you think that made Edward feel?   You'd think it would bring them closer together but 50 years later he still doesn't like her all that much.   Do you think he tried to comfort her or talk to her?

It takes place in the 1850's I think, and its about this girl who lives with her abusive father on a farm, and all of her younger sisters; her mom is sick. anyways she goes to work at her uncle's general store, and she is bought by this guy who used to live on the farm next door to her family's. He makes her marry him so that he can inherit some land from his grandfather.   It was kind of old too, from the 90's i think. in the end the girl fell in love with her husband. They had a son, and he went into the logging business.      I think its the first book in a trilogy, where each book is about a different generation or something.      It is NOT A Girl In Blue, by Ann Rinaldi
20090202225144AA2YP8n	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	THE CORD - leanne o'sullivan?	i was wondering if someone could help and add a lina or phrase into this poem anywhere      thankss      I used to lie on the floor for hours after   school with the phone cradled between   my shoulder and my ear, a plate of cold   rice to my left, my school books to my right.   Twirling the cord between my fingers   I spoke to friends who recognized the   language of our realm. Throats and lungs   swollen, we talked into the heart of the night,   toying with the idea of hair dye and suicide,   about the boys who didn’t love us,   who we loved too much, the pang   of the nights. Each sentence was   new territory, like a door someone was   rushing into, the glass shattering   with delirium, with knowledge and fear.   My Mother never complained about the phone bill,   what it cost for her daughter to disappear   behind a door, watching the cord   stretching its muscle away from her.   Perhaps she thought it was the only way   she could reach me, sending me away   to speak in the underworld.   As long as I was speaking   she could put my ear to the tenuous earth   and allow me to listen, to decipher.   And these were the elements of my Mother,   the earthed wire, the burning cable,   as if she flowed into the room with   me to somehow say, Stay where I can reach you,   the dim room, the dark earth. Speak of this   and when you feel removed from it   I will pull the cord and take you   back towards me.

20090202231855AAcbIO5	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	What's multiracial mean and what's armenian?	I'm just wondering what the term multiracial means.      For example, if I'm English, Italian, Armenian, and Norwegian does that mean I'm multiracial or since those are all basically white races, am I still considered just one race?      Also, what are the actual physical traits of an armenian?   I know I'm rather strongly armenian, my great great grandfather traveled to America from Armenia and my granddad has told me I look Armenian, but what does that mean exactly?      Just wondering.

Then: What motivates Pony and Johnny to save the kids in the burning church? and why did Hinton include the event in the book?(chap 6)   And the last one is: do you think it is realistic that the Socs admit they were to blame for Bob's death?

20090202211122AAetqIv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think this is a good idea for a novel?	i'm gonna keep it simple... Alright so I'm a teen bodybuilder, and I wanted to show the world that in the world of bodybuilding and powerlifting, there's just as many tears and fights as there is in any kind of group of friends.      its gonna be the story of two guys, one skrawny and weak named mitch, one kinda chubby named tim. they meet freshman year, and become instant friends and start having parties with their close friends, hooking each other up with their long-time friends that are girls, life's sweet for them, they're happy, they're great friends, have girls that care about them, its the sweet life.      i'm not gonna go into how they get into bodybuilding, but basically they meet a bodybuilder from their school and in the four months they know him before he moves he manages to inspire them to get into bodybuilding.      progression goes fast for them, mitch gets and 8-pack, tim slims down and gets a 6-pack, but they realized abs won't get them anywhere, so they get a gym membership and start working out together where they work off of helping each other.      time goes by, Mitch and tim are sophomores by the time the story's totally set itself up. Tim is considered one of the best looking guys in the school and gets all the girls, while Mitch has far surpassed the bodybuilder they had met a year earlier and is beyond what anyone thought possible of a human being, let alone skinny old mitch.      Tim gets tons of action and meets lots of cool new guys, while mitch gets none of it. Girls like Tim's smooth natural muscles, not mitch's ripped-to-shreds muscles and popping veins. So mitch starts wearing baggy t-shirts and eventually he meets this girl (name? no idea yet). She doesn't know Mitch is a bodybuilder but falls in love with his funny personality, and mitch falls in love with her cause she's quiet and sweet.      Tim, on the other hand, is getting with the one girl mitch couldn't hate more (sparing details), and Tim tells Mitch how he doesn't actually have feelings for her but enjoys her sexual appeal more than any other girl he's been with.      Mitch, desperate to change the subject, tells Tim that he thinks he's in love with the girl, whom he is now dating. Tim laughs and tells Mitch that he's whipped. But then Tim gets an idea, all in good-will of course.      Mitch attends a big crossfit event for teens. All the contestants tear their shirts off to prepare for a grueling test of their abilities. Mitch, while appearing small at first, is clearly a thousand times as ripped as any of them.      The competition begins, and Mitch is in first, Tim is cheering on the sidelines with his girlfriend, still hot from making out with him as usual.       Then it gets to the rope climb, all Mitch has to do is climb the rope in a weighted vest and ring the bell and he's won it! But then he notices something, Tim had decided to surprise him and brought Mitch's girlfriend along who had never had any clue about Mitch's bodybuilding appearance or lifestyle.      pumped up on adrenalyne, Mitch tries to forget it as he starts climbing the rope, he's almost at the top but he can't hear his girlfriend cheering for some reason. for some reason he takes a glance down, and there's his girlfriend vomitting into a trash can, she's disgusted by his body as was every other girl who wouldn't give him a chance.      Mitch's eyes tear and he falls from the rope onto the mat, all of his adrenalyne is drained and he collapses.      Mitch gets pissed at tim, they fight (verbal) and go their separate ways.      The twist comes finally when Mitch is at home and hears one night that two things are happening. his now ex-girlfriend that he still loves wants him to come over so they can get back together, but at the same time Tim had gotten in huge trouble... he got a girl pregnant and the girl's boyfriend, a big guy, was out to get him, a fight was gonna go down for sure. And Mitch's life had gone from perfection to hell all because of his passion for extreme fitness.            I know it sounds lame.... but if you were a gym rat it'd make a little more sense.      If you have any other ideas how i can express some difficulties between bodybuilders and make a deep novel about them, please tell me. thanks

20090202210322AAlfMpC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good book im writing it.?	Um ok im only 11 so keep that in mind Its supossed to be about a 13 year old girl pretty much writing in her diary as shes dying in the hospital         Before I Die……             Ch.1- My life        I woke up from what felt like days of being asleep. I woke up today and felt no different than when I went to sleep. To tell you the truth I might feel worse. As days go by I feel sicker or maybe I’m just getting sick of this room, this hospital, all this medicine. Well let’s start from the beginning. My name is Leah and  I was 7 years old when this started it started with me feeling terribly ill and then my life started changing   ,    forever. I’m 13 now. I have, no let’s make that had a tumor. It was removed today my stomach I still very weak. Even though it’s gone I have this feeling that it’s not  gone, that I’ll never be cured. I cry every day in the mornings, at night before I go to bed, just laying  wondering if I’m going to survive. The hardest part is my family is just me and my mom, my dad left us when he found out about my sickness. I hear my mom cry every night I think she thinks the same things that I wonder. I have only one friend, Kayla , one friend that’s dying I got the news last week they told me that they’ve tried everything they could and it’s not curable. I cry even harder every night now. Kayla entered the hospital the same day I did we shared the same room. We related to each other. I’m not allowed to see her anymore I never got to say goodbye. I’ve got to get some sleep now we’ll talk soon.        Ch.2- Torture       A couple of months have past since I last wrote. Kayla died last night I feel that a part of me has died too. I sometimes think she’ll be happier up there. She suffered 10 times as bad as me. I still won’t accept that she’s gone, for good. I’ll never see her again. Well alive that is. I miss her so much. Well she’s gone and I’ll just have to accept that. I saw my father. Just seeing his well it just…. Disgusted me. When I was young he told me that he’d always be there when I need him. Well that was a lie he was never there he doesn’t  know and I don’t want to know him. He said he came to try and make up the years lost he wasn’t here I think it was guilt I don’t think he even cares. I met a little girl 3 days ago I see her every day now. She is 4 years old and suffers with a brain tumor. She is very strong I think she can survive it I hope she can survive it. I can’t leave  the hospital yet. The doctors say I’m not strong enough. I know that I also have to wait to see if it returns.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth.      Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same.      And both that morning equally lay   In leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back.      I shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.      WHY IS THIS CONSIDERED A MODERNIST POEM???    In modernist poetry, aren't words used for their actual meaning rather than for any implied or symbolic meaning?

A virus or something has mysteriously killed all the men off the earth, with the exception of you.  Your current relationship status applies; if you are married, you're still married.  If you're single, you are still single.  What would you do?  Do you think some women might want to kill you?  Would you repopulate the earth or just stick with one woman?    This question is in honor of the graphic novel my roommate suggested I read.

20081110191204AAgBJ40	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read and tell me what u think plz?	   The bright light of morning crept through my bedroom window as I stirred in bed.   “Another day in paradise,” I mumbled sarcastically to myself as I fumbled with the baby blue sheet currently snaked around me, preventing my escape. The bright lavender walls of my bedroom were the same as they had been since I was little, besides the small tears from where I had picked at it as a child, and the fading from years of cigarette smoke when my father had been alive. He died in a car accident when I was 4, so I knew very little about him. When I was finally free of the sheets, I dressed and jogged downstairs to eat the eggs and bacon I could smell as the scent ascended the stairs and drifted into my room.   “Morning,” I mumbled dully as I jumped down the last flight of steps, the mahogany wood chipped and worn from years of me and my 17 year old brother’s horseplay. My mom’s rebuttal was as predictable as ever.    “You really need to stop being so immature, Elizabeth. You are 15 years old for heavens sake.” Ugh! She knows I hate the name Elizabeth, and yet she continues to use it!   “Ok first of all its Liz, mom. It’s not that hard to remember! Second I’m not immature I just like to express myself, unlike some one I know,” I shot back obviously annoyed by her already. My mother and I don’t get along, to put it lightly. We both silently blame each other for my father’s death. She was the one who made him go out to buy tickets for that stupid recital! I didn’t even want them to go to it, but she blames me because it was my dance recital. Since his death it’s been world war three in our rundown shack of a house. My mom is a teacher, so naturally our home isn’t a royal palace. What makes matters worse is that she works at my high school, so she is constantly checking up on me, and butting into my business. I can’t stand her!   “Give it a rest Liz, she’s never listened before, so what makes you think she will now?” Luke, my brother and the only person I can rely on, replied while displaying his absolutely gorgeous smile. He wasn’t very fond of our oh so loveable mother either, but he wasn’t as open about it as I was.   “I know, but sometimes I hope that maybe our real mom is trapped somewhere and she will magically poof down someday and save us from zombie mom over there,” I smiled triumphantly at the glare she shot at me. I saw Luke chuckling in the background, though he would never admit it openly.   “Come on little sis, time to go share your lovey feelings with everyone at school,” Luke called as he walked out the door. I shot one more smug look at my mom before jogging out the door after him.   “How can you put up with her?” I asked when I had finally caught up with him. He looked down at me with humor evident in his eyes. He was a got head taller than me, and I was 5 ft. 6.   “A better question is how do I put up with you? Your witty comments just provoke her.” He pointed out with a look that screamed ‘I’m right and you know it.’   “True….but seeing that look on her face just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!” It was impossible for him to hold a straight face on that one.   “How do you come up with this stuff Liz? Honestly, you’re going to grow up to be a comedian if I don’t set you straight soon!” Luke loved to tease me about my sense of humor and often found much entertainment in listening to my mother and I fight, not that I could blame him.   “Hmmm maybe I was dropped on my head as a baby and it completely wiped out all of the genetics I got from mom, because the only thing funny about her is her looks.” We both laughed at that. Mom was no beauty queen. She is way to thin, I swear she’s anorexic, and he face looks like a mix of a grizzly bear and a pig after rolling in a mud puddle.   “I think I’m leaning more along the lines of adoption,” he winked as he said it.   “Well then she must have stolen us from the orphanage because there is absolutely no way anyone would give her a child!” At that moment we reached Mackdale high school, named after the town, Mackdale, Georgia. It was just an institute of torture in my eyes. I groaned aloud as I walked through the front gates.   “Oh give it a rest Liz, its not so bad. At least you don’t have mom as a teacher.” Mom taught senior research writing, so Luke had the honor of sitting in her class for an hour every day. He always played the pity card when I whined about school saying that I was lucky I didn’t have to sit in mom’s class everyday.   “If I had mom as a teacher I would have been expelled by now. I still don’t understand why you decided to take research writing when you knew mom was the teacher.” He looked at me like I had just said pigs could fly.   “Liz, you know I want to be a journalist. In order to do that I have to take all the writing and computer classes I can. Research writing is the most important of all of them. If I don’t even know how to write a research paper how can I ever hope to be a journalist?” That made sense I guess, but I still can’t imagine a car

20090202213739AAkOqmF	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your worldview?	In 1885 The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche presented the idea of the World Riddle in his tome Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The idea was further elaborated upon in 1895 by the German zoologist/philosopher Ernst Haeckel as dual in form. American psychologist William James extended upon Nietzsche and Haeckel in his 1907 work, Pragmatism. The riddle goes as such:      1. What is the nature of the physical universe?      2. What is the nature of human thinking?      The answer received may be shocking, if not rather revealing.

20090202213124AA8bfMN	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	I don't know what reality is anymore. I don't know how I feel about things. Can anyone relate?	I don't know how I feel. I can't gauge it anymore, it's like I know I'm moving, but the needle on the speedometer is broken and it's pitch black outside with no headlights. I don't love my girl friend. I feel intense guilt for saying this -- even when I only whisper it to myself. I broke up with her, but I have mixed emotions about it. I feel so simultaneously free, reborn, and happy, but also sad, guilty, and regretful. Why?     I've been feeling this way for awhile -- it's not like shock from the break-up or anything... I don't know what to do with my life. I feel trapped and stagnant and uncertain of what I like or dislike or get pleasure out of anymore. Everything has become such a blur. I don't feel alive I feel like I'm in limbo. I don't have perspective -- I purposely try to AVOID having perspective because I'm so afraid of being biased or idealogical or stereotypical. Can anyone relate?

20090202213840AAd6VSM	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Getting rid of film for cameras?	Is anyone else a little upset about this?  Don't get me wrong, I love digital and being able to delete bad pictures.  I also use all the editing programs since I am a photographer.  The thing is, film and working in the darkroom is what made me fall in love with photography.  I still use the old Cannon film cameras.  It is just part of the magic in my opinion.  On another note, not everyone wants to take the time to learn the programs available to them, especially older generations.  I think it is a mistake to get rid of film completely.  If they want to cut back on it, make it available to photographers and schools.  What do you think?

20090202214028AAnl9Aq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I can't remember the name of this book....?	I was probably 16 when I started reading it, but due to a house fire I never got to finish it.  Still from time to time it comes back to plague my memory (especially when I'm between books like I am now) and it's been almost 17 years. I remember the beginning - it focuses on a girl at school when the bombs start to fall, she runs home, which is out side of town. The house (maybe it was a cellar) is boarded/plasticed up, food and water sealed up.... she survives her parents don't after a time anyway - it goes on to talk about how she lives and others die but then my house burnt down and i don't know the rest.... Can anyone help me?
