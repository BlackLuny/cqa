xDubataIaa	It is rare but it does happen. If it does not become unstuck after moving it in any and all directions, then you will have to load an earlier save. If you don't have one, then your only other option is to use a gameshark and input code to get it unstuck. Some people use a code to turn the buggy into a chocobo which gets it unstuck somehow. You probably don't want to buy a gameshark but that really is your only option outside of restarting the game. It sucks but you have learned just how important it is to have multiple save files in the event that game ruining glitch does happen. Having all those hours you put into a game go to waste like that is very disheartening.|`|ty9nJiSkaa	Dunno never had that problem and i would think you should be able to just back out but if not you probably have to restart.

vOKe5ZpEaa	When purchasing an asian ball jointed doll it's best to do a bit of research first to <br>  <br>  #1 choose the right doll <br>  #2 buy with some confidence<br>  #3 be able to get answers to questions<br>  <br>  New dolls for the most part come from overseas. US dealers have some dolls in stock, but only a few companies actually have stores in the US.  Volks and Elfdoll currently have shops in California. Buying from overseas companies is fine but the shipping costs to the US run around 40 to 50 dollars. The wait for the doll you order can be upwards of 3 to 6 months. <br>  <br>  My recomendation is to ask your questions of people that own dolls. Find out what's out there and decide which doll you like. Then find out the options on how to purchase one. Do you want someone to do the face up so that the doll is uniquely yours? Find an artist to do that for you? Who makes outfits for this particular size?  The fun thing about BJDs is how totally unique they can be.<br>  <br>   Some of my bjds can be seen on our website at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.american-doll-outfitters.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.american-doll-outfitters.com</a><br>  <br>  Here are a couple of forums that you can go to and see pictures posted by various owners of these dolls. They also list them for sale (make sure you check references first) and can answer questions about them first hand.<br>  <br>  Try <br>  <br>   <a href="http://members.boardhost.com/ZoneofZenBJD/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.boardhost.com/ZoneofZenBJ...</a><br>  <br>  you have to register<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.denofangels.com/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.denofangels.com/forums/index....</a><br>  <br>  again you have to register<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you in your search and I hope I answered some of your questions.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Most of the companies sell them directly, and there are also various people who sell for companies (Featherfall and Denver Doll Emporium both sell for different companies, if I recall correctly). So far I've found the companies to be quite reliable, and I've heard of people having good luck with Featherfall and DDE too.

8hbm4uiPaa	No, activated abilities on permanents are not spells.<br>  <br>  All cards in the game, except for lands, are spells. When you play an instant, sorcery, planeswalker, creature, enchantment or artifact, you are playing a spell. When you use an ability, it is exactly that; an ability.<br>  <br>  Activated abilities are abilites that you must actively choose to use, by either paying a mana cost, by tapping, or both. Any ability that has a cost associated with it, ending with a colon, such as 'Pay 1:' is an activated ability.<br>  <br>  A triggered ability is an ability that is activated by something that occurs within the game state. 'When a creature goes to the graveyard, you may gain one life' is a triggered ability.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples:<br>  <br>  'Pay 1, sacrifice a creature: You gain one life' (Activated Ability)<br>  <br>  'Whenever you sacrifice a creature, you may gain one life' (Triggered Ability)<br>  <br>  'Whenever a creature is sacrificed, you may pay 1, if you do, gain one life' (Triggered Ability)<br>  <br>  'When this creature comes into play, you may pay 1, if you do, gain one life' (Triggered Ability)<br>  <br>  'TAP: Sacrifice this creature. It does 1 damage to target creature or player' (Activated Ability)|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Activated abilities have a colon in the line separating the ability from the cost. For example. TAP: Add G to your mana pool is a activated ability.<br>  <br>  Triggered abilities are abilities that trigger at certain times in the game. For example, "At the beginning of your main phase, add G to your mana pool" is a triggered ability.<br>  <br>  Abilities are considered objects, but not spells. Spells are physical cards and copies of physical cards that you play.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|07dEAJg9aa	Abilities are not spells.<br>  <br>  Watch this video and it will all be explained<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i_ywQcmfWQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i_ywQcmf...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Activated:<br>  You can use the ability whenever you want when you do what it asks.  If I had to sacrifice a creature to use the ability, I choose when I will do it.<br>  <br>  Triggered:<br>  They can happen whenever as well, but you can't prevent it from happening.  So if a card said "At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrafice a creature," I can't prevent that or control that from happening.  It is "triggered" by me starting my turn.|`|5gG42iOpaa	No, activated abilities are abilities (hence cards differentiate between spells and activated abilities, like "counter target activated ability" vs. "Counter target spell"<br>  <br>  An activated ability has a cost and you chose to use it, a triggered ability happens automatically when something "triggers" it.

Be sure to join their forum as well.|`|LIwx56Qcaa	Each player places one of their Gate cards face down (Bakugan logo face up) in the field so that they barely touch each other at the top (similar to dominoes). The player whose turn it is chooses a Bakugan and says "Bakugan - Brawl". The player then rolls one of his unused Bakugan at the Gate cards in the field <br>  <br>  If 2 Bakugan end up on the same Gate card, battle begins. See the site reference to learn all the details to play Bakugan.

dqeR7BJlaa	No it's not bad. Lets say you got 2 out of 5 wrong so you had 3/5 correct out of that homework. Giving you a D for that homework. But out of the class you got 98/100 correct. Those being the only two you got wrong in the entire class. Sure that one homework you might have missed something, but you obviously know what you are doing overall in math. My parents were the same way and they really just need to relax. Look at the big picture. If you're not failing the CLASS then a single homework shouldn't matter. Just keep doing good in school and your parents will eventually come around. (hopefully)<br>  <br>  In college I got a D on a physics exam but did well enough in the rest of the class (other exams/quizes/homework) to get an A. The only thing that shows up on my transcript is that I got an A in physics. I'm currently a computer scientist (software engineer). I obviously turned out just fine but guess what I got a D on a physics exam!!!!! OMG!!!!! <br>  <br>  It happens.<br>  <br>  Your parents need to stop putting so much pressure on you and see that you're a good student overall.

Eran grandes y tenan bordes cortantes y tacos y estaban atados a largas sogas. Hacia el 1800 el yo-yo lleg a Europa como una versin en forma de juguete de este arma.

A Estados Unidos lleg en la dcada de 1860 pero no fue hasta la dcada de 1920. Pedro Flores, un inmigrante filipino, fue la primera persona que comenz a producir yo-yos en grandes cantidades. Los juguetes de Flores llevaban el nombre de yo-yo.    En 1929, el norteamericano Donald Duncan le compr los derechos a Flores, convirti la palabra yo-yo en una marca de mercado (?) y cambi el nudo fijo que hasta entonces conectaba el cordel con el eje por un lazo corredizo que permita mayor versatilidad al juguete.

No s si sea cierto.|`|1c0f59c410e90a3d632bed1cbd786879aa	he visto algunas respuestas:    Y0-Y0, 1000 a.C., China    En el siglo XVI, los cazadores filipinos idearon un yo-yo, que era un arma constituida por dos grandes discos de madera y una recia liana que los una. El yo-yo se lanzaba con habilidad, y su liana atrapaba al animal por las patas y lo derribaba, lo que permita acabar con l con toda facilidad. El yo-yo facilitaba la tarea a los cazadores, como en el caso del bumern australiano, que tambin permita reducir a la presa desde lejos. El nombre proviene del tagalo, una lengua Indonesia que es la ms antigua y la ms hablada entre los filipinos. En su origen el yo-yo no era, pues, un juguete.         En los a?os veinte, un americano emprendedor llamado Donald Duncan pudo contemplar el yo-yo filipino en accin. Reduciendo el tama?o del arma, la transform en un juguete infantil, conservando el nombre tagalo, pero el yo-yo de Duncan no fue el verdadero origen del juego.         Como juguete, el yo-yo se origin en China hacia el a?o 1000 a.C. La versin oriental consista en dos discos de marfil con un cordn de seda arrollado alrededor de su eje central. Andando el tiempo, este juguete chino se difundi en Europa, donde fue adornado suntuosamente con joyas y pintado con dibujos geomtricos, a fin de que su rotacin creara efectos hipnticos.  http://www.tinet.org/~vne/juegos%2002.ht...  y otra respuesta:  Historia del yo-yo  Un artefacto similar al yo-yo exista ya hacia el a?o 1000 antes de Cristo en China, donde se utilizaba como instrumento hipntico.

b038c50f6ffa79d8beb0513fde16e68eaa	Texas Hold'em, o p?quer da TV    Este  o estilo de p?quer jogado nos programas de TV e na maioria dos sites de p?quer online.  um p?quer aberto, em que os jogadores recebem duas cartas fechadas e s?o dispostas cinco abertas sobre a mesa. Para vencer, o jogador deve combinar suas duas cartas fechadas com trs das cinco abertas. Ao contrrio do p?quer aberto tradicional, as cartas abertas s?o as mesmas para todos os participantes.     S?o quatro rodadas de apostas: uma depois que os participantes recebem as duas cartas fechadas, outra assim que s?o colocadas na mesa trs cartas abertas de uma s vez (chamadas de "Flop") e outras duas aps serem abertas duas cartas na mesa (denominadas "Turn" e a "River"), uma por vez, totalizando sete cartas em jogo para cada competidor. O Texas Hold'em prev troca de cartas.    Nesta varia??o de p?quer, antes das cartas serem distribudas, os dois jogadores  esquerda do carteador (tambm chamado de "crupi" e identificado por um bot?o que fica  sua frente na mesa) devem fazer suas apostas, chamadas de "Big Blind" e "Small Blind".    O Small Blind paga metade do valor da aposta do Big Blind e os outros participantes devem cobrir ou aumentar a quantidade de fichas apostadas para seguirem no jogo. Se algum subir a aposta, os demais precisam pagar a diferen?a para jogarem.    Distribudas as cartas fechadas, o jogador  esquerda do Big Blind poder sair do jogo, cobrir a aposta ou aumentar o valor (tambm chamado de "relan?ar"). Os outros participantes tambm optam por umas destas trs jogadas. Ao final desta primeira rodada de apostas, o crupi apresenta o Flop (as trs cartas abertas iniciais).    Acontece ent?o a segunda rodada de apostas, iniciada pelo jogador  esquerda do crupi. Em seguida, o carteador coloca o Turn na mesa (a quarta carta aberta). Segue-se outra rodada de apostas, iniciada novamente pelo jogador  esquerda do crupi. Encerrada a terceira rodada de apostas,  colocada na mesa o River (quinta carta aberta).    Os participantes ent?o fazem a ltima rodada de apostas e mostram seus jogos (conhecido como "showdown"), a come?ar pelo ltimo que abriu as apostas ou relan?ou.     Somente este jogador tem obriga??o de mostrar seu jogo. Os demais, se perceberem que n?o podem vencer, podem deixar suas cartas escondidas. Porm, se algum possuir um jogo maior, deve mostrar a todos. A maior combina??o leva todas as fichas.    Existem algumas varia??es no Texas Hold'em quanto ao limite mximo no valor de uma aposta. O No Limit Hold'em permite o chamado "all-in", ou seja, apostar tudo que se tem. Porm, nenhuma aposta pode ser inferior ao pingo, o valor apostado para entrar na partida.    O Limit Hold'em s aceita o valor mximo definido pelos jogadores no incio da partida, que poder ser apostado aps o Turn e o River e apenas a metade poder ser colocada no Flop. J o Pot Limit Hold'em aceita que o jogador aposte no mximo a quantidade de fichas colocadas na mesa at aquele momento.|`|a7d99784ed7002867b186322302ac728aa	Origem  N?o existem informa??es precisas sobre onde o Texas hold'em foi jogado pela primeira vez. De acordo com a lenda, os primeiros jogos foram realizados em Robstown, Texas, Estados Unidos, no incio do sculo XX. O jogo foi introduzido em Las Vegas por um grupo de apostadores e jogadores de cartas texanos, incluindo Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson e Amarillo Slim.  Regras  As descri??es abaixo assumem familiaridade com as regras bsicas do p?quer, e das m?os possveis em cada jogo.  Objetivo  Como vrias outras variantes do p?quer, o objetivo do Texas hold 'em  ganhar o pote, isto , ganhar a soma em dinheiro de aposta apostada pelos outros jogadores da mesa. Um pote  ganho tanto pela descida do melhor jogo de cinco cartas das sete possveis, ou pela desistncia de todos os outros jogadores por apostas n?o acompanhadas.  Estrutura da aposta   A estrutura de carteado do Texas hold 'emHold 'em  normalmente jogado usando small blinds e big blinds. Uma aposta comunitria tambm pode ser utilizada em conjunto com os blinds, particularmente depois de vrias rodadas em um jogo de campeonato. Um indicador do carteador  usado para representar o jogador na posi??o de distribui??o das cartas. A cada jogada o indicador  movimentado em sentido horrio, mudando a posi??o do carteador e dos blinds. O small blind  pago pelo jogador  esquerda do carteador, e geralmente equivale  metade do big blind. O big blind  pago pelo jogador  esquerda do small blind, e equivale  aposta mnima do jogo. Em jogos de campeonato, o pre?o do blind e da jogada comunitria periodicamente aumenta com o progresso do torneio. Em alguns casos o small blind  alguma fra??o do big blind diferente de 50%, especialmente quando a aposta mnima possui valor mpar. Por exemplo, quando o big blind est em $15, o valor do small blind geralmente utilizado  $10.  As trs maiores varia??es do Hold 'em s?o o Hold 'em de aposta limitada, Hold 'em sem limite de aposta e Hold 'em limitado pelo pote.  Hold 'em de aposta limitada  historicamente a forma mais popular do jogo em cassinos. Nele, as apostas e aumentos durante as duas primeiras rodadas de aposta devem ser iguais ao big blind. Nas outras jogadas as apostas e aumentos devem ser iguais ao dobro do big blind.  Hold 'em sem limite  a forma mais comum em torneios televisionados. Nele, os jogadores podem apostar ou aumentar qualquer valor entre o big blind e a quantia que disp?em em jogo (o chamado tudo em jogo (do ingls all-in) no jarg?o do jogo).  No Hold 'em limitado pelo pote, o limite das apostas e aumentos  o tamanho atual do pote.  Jogada em m?os  Uma rodada come?a com cada jogador recebendo duas cartas, que s?o as nicas cartas que o jogador recebe individualmente. Elas somente ser?o mostradas se o jogador mostrar seu jogo. A m?o come?a com a primeira rodada de apostas, em sentido horrio a partir do jogador  esquerda do big blind.  Aps essa rodada, assumindo que ainda restam pelo menos dois jogadores participando, o cartador mostra o flop, que consiste em trs cartas comunitrias. A seguir  feita a segunda rodada de apostas, valendo a mesma ordem de apostas da primeira rodada.  Aps a rodada do flop  mostrada a quarta carta comunitria, o turn (ou fourth street), seguida da terceira rodade de apostas. Posteriormente a quinta e ltima carta comunitria  mostrada, o river (ou fifth street), seguida de nova rodada de apostas.  Se aps a ltima rodada de apostas ainda restam pelo menos dois jogadores, a descida das cartas individuais  feita.  Descida das cartas  Se um jogador aposta e todos os outros desistem, o jogador remanescente ganha o pote e n?o precisa mostrar suas cartas. Se pelo menos dois jogadores ainda restam aps a rodada final de apostas, a descida das cartas  feita. Nesse momento, cada jogador mostra suas cinco melhores cartas entre suas duas individuais e as cinco comunitrias. O jogador pode utilizar amabas as suas cartas individuais, somente uma ou at mesmo nenhuma.  Se houver empate entre jogadores na escolha da melhor m?o, ent?o o pote  divido entre eles. Caso sobre alguma ficha, ela pertencer ao jogador participante do empate mais prximo do carteador em sentido horrio.  Terminologia de m?os  Existem 1.326 (52 * 51 / 2) combina??es diferentes para as duas cartas individuais recebidas entre as 52 do baralho. Apesar disso, como os naipes s s?o teis para flushes, vrias dessas combina??es s?o indistinguveis do ponto de vista de uma estratgia anterior ao flop. Considerando naipes como equivalentes, existem 169 (13 * 13) combina??es distintas para as duas cartas individuais.  Como exemplo, apesar de J? J? e J? J? serem combina??es distintas, elas s?o consideradas equivalentes antes do flop. Qualquer jogada com duas cartas de mesmo valor, como exemplificadas acima, s?o chamadas par de m?o. Logo, cartas individuais 77 s?o chamadas par de m?o de sete.  Estratgia  N?o exite mtodo simples para definir as estratgias do hold 'em. De modo geral, a maioria dos autores recomenda uma estratgia agressiva para o jogo, o que envolve aceitar o jogo com cartas n?o t?o boas, mas apostando e aumentando apostas frequentemente com outros jogadores agressivos. Todos os autores concordam que alterar a jogada baseado na posi??o do jogador  um componente importante na estratgia do jogo. Tendo em vista que a ordem das a??es  geralmente a mesma em cada rodada de apostas, aqueles que jogam depois possuem mais informa??o que aqueles que jogam antes. Como resultado, a maioria das estratgias do p?quer encorajam a jogar menos quando estiver em posi??es iniciais e mais quando estiver em posi??es finais de aposta.  O jogo na cultura popular  Em 1998, o filme Rounders, estrelando Matt Damon e Edward Norton, mostrou um lado romantico de jogo como um estilo de vida.

Certas brincadeiras que brincam como cora??o das pessoas s?o um exemplo.  Eu nunca o fiz, nem recomendo, pois  uma ofensa ao nosso grande Deus. Mas tenho um professor que nos contou sobre a sua experincia nessa brincadeira.  Segundo ele, todos faziam perguntas, e no final o esprito disse para o meu professor que sabia que ele n?o acreditava no que estava acontecendo, ent?o falava em cdigo:  'Relgio' dizia o esprito 'Relgio'.  O meu professor disse que n?o entendeu. O esprito disse 'Luz'  Meu professor assimilou que fosse o Relgio de luz. Quando chegou no relgio, olhou por fora disse n?o haver nada estranho. Porm quando abriu o espa?o do disjuntor viu um papel dobrado.  Quando ele abriu o papel viu que era um peda?o de sua agenda que ele mantinha escondida. Resolveu olhar na agenda pra confirmar e viu que havia mesmo uma pgina rasgada.    Depois desse relato o professor advertiu que n?o era uma brincadeira a ser feita, pois mexia muito com os nervos das pessoas.    ;-)

c89068e0c0604abeb5429aa9616a7395aa	I have been checking in on the Wii and PS3 reports for the past few weeks, and from what I have seen thus far, I don't think a Wii will be all that hard to buy before Christmas. Whereas Sony has had numerous setbacks in PS3 production, all the releases from Nintendo regarding the Wii have reported smooth sailing from concept to release. It's hard to say what the actual numbers are, but the projected release numbers for the Wii are pretty high, especially when compared to the PS3 and the Xbox 360's release last year. On top of repectable release-day shipments, Nintendo is talking quite a lot more consoles in the weeks after release.  Another note, if you live in a sparsely populated area, would be to keep calling the Wal-Mart stores in your area. I lived in southern Illinois for a while, and found that Wal-Mart doesn't seem to pay much mind to population density when they distribute new items. I've been able to walk into the local Wal-Mart and pick up a new console the day after release with no hassle all the way back to the original Playstation. This being due to the local super Wal-Mart in our town with a population of fourteen thousand getting the same number of consoles shipped to them as the supercenters in St. Louis (why is beyond me, but I'm not complaining!)|`|011890d5c90493b7fb7c48a75ea98aedaa	Shouldn't be too hard.  I work at a game store and I've been told that we should be getting some more within the next upcoming weeks.  Probably 2 or 3 more shipments are due out before X-Mas.  Good luck getting one.|`|AA11790271	Not that hard.  The Wii isn't overpriced like the PS3, and it's manufactured by Nintendo.  So there will probably be no shortage of them, since Wiis aren't hard to produce.  You should probably be able to get one.    God bless.

In that case, it is possible to smuggle passes of dimension in the Party Quests - in the exit room the smuggler quickly unplugs their (dialup only) internet cord, uses lag to pick up the passes and then plugs in the cord again. This way you can get all the passes you need by repeating the first stage and then zip through them all when you have enough.    That's the only one I know of. :-)|`|TqFM3suOaa	There are no cheats.

If you like RPGs, simulation, platformers and odd genres, get the DS Lite.     If you get DS, I would highly recommend Animal Crossing, Meteos and Castlevania.   And also:    Mario Kart if you like racing  Kirby Canvas Curse if you like platformers  Wario Ware Touched if you like something goofy and fun  Nintendogs if you'd like a pet sim  Final Fantasy III if you like RPGs    DS is just a much more varied system in my view. PSP caters towards a very hardcore crowd. If you are a hardcore gamer and like the genres on PSP, go for it. I'd recommend these games: Lumines, Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth if you decide to go for PSP.     Also, I would not recommend the GB micro. Gameboy is losing support as it is the "last generation portable system" and has been replaced in the mainstream by DS. Also, DS can play all Gameboy Advance games.

The required info is also listed on this page.|`|0a396290ebbdc1edd36753bac148d42aaa	This could be the dreaded "three red lights" problem, in which case the only way to fix it is to return it to microsoft, or wherever you bought it, to get a new one or have it repaired. They should do this for free, depending on how long ago you bought it. But look closely at the lights first to see if there are three or four. Four could be a different problem entirely.    P.S. Be careful if you get a replacement 360. Try to get one manufactured sometime in 2007. And send the power cord in too, that can be the source of the problem. I have a friend that  had his 7th 360 die today of the three red lights. So be careful!|`|3f0c246403d7b4fc67a9ada159ebee76aa	Yup, he's exactly right. Thats what I had to do, and I had to pay $120.

Play the game before you judge it.|`|7696260c065e27737623ffcbae382770aa	it's a game base on how an alien race is attempting to activate a powerful weapon located in space that has been there for years and the humans and alien are fighting to control it. untill the humans realize that the weapon (which is called the halo) doesnt just destroy your enemies but all life in the galixy so the humans want to destroy it. in halo 2, the humans and aliens are at war still and they both discover a second halo and then the aliens go under a civil war and it really get confusing unless you play the whole game.    oh and it also has awsome online gameplay and halo is probaly the most popular xbox exclusive|`|5nkV99Kiaa	Its very addicting when you play.

hEFSNBAbaa	The only problem with the first answer, is that there is no diversity whatsoever.  Now, I would be more than happy to help you.  What is always required when creating good movesets for Pokemon, is diversity.  So, let's look at what Luxray can learn, and what it learns from TMs (HMs aren't always the best methods, but they do work if there is nothing else!)  For Luxray, I recommend: Crunch, Discharge, Iron Tail, and you could pick: Thunderbolt, Protect, Giga Impact, or even Strength.  Now, let me explain.  Crunch is useful when you encounter those pesky Psychics who know who to use Recover.  Faint them in one hit with Crunch (if you are at a high level).  Discharge is a nice Electric attack, but with only 80 power, but a 30% chance of paralysis.  Iron Tail is nice to have, with 100 Power, and a 30% chance of lowering defense.  It even has 15PP.  The more PP with a high power move is great!  The last move is up to you.  Thunderbolt could be used if you would like a stronger Electric move, Protect, well, I don't really have to explain, do I?  Giga Impact is just pure power, but use it occasionly.  Strength, is just an HM you can use if you don't like any of the above three.  It's power is good, at 80.  I would say stick with attacks no less than 80.  70 and up is okay.  Keep in mind that defensive attacks are different in this case, the fact that they don't have power.  When choosing defensive attacks, think about what they do to your opponent, or even to yourself.  Don't concentrate on "You're coming with me!" attacks, like Perish Song, and Destiny Bond (in which case, when you faint, they faint.  Get it?  You're coming with me!).  So, hope this helps!|`|YItJjGNCaa	thunder, thunderbolt, zap cannon, and crunch

UXgLuaQnaa	Ossyria contains places like Orbis, Ludi, Aqua Road, and El Nath.  You go to Ellinia, and at the top right there's a sign, I think it says Sixtopia.  Go there and there's a woman in a ticket booth.  Buy a ticket (5k) to Orbis, then wait for the ship to come.  It leaves every 30 minutes, starting on the hour.  The ride is about 10 minutes so you'll want something to do during the wait.

It will not work for any firmware dat is higher. Dats just Sony for u.

And to add to dat, Sony will refuse to fix da problem becuz they'll accuse u of violating ur agreement with dem by purchasing the PSP.|`|a5nEFsRSaa	You have to have a usb cable.

MwltNt5Zaa	I would choose the Wii. There are many games and will be many more, not to mention all of the classic Sega and Nintendo games you can buy on the virtual console, and there are lots of other things you can do on the Wii such as web browsing. The PSP, while it does have some good games and all the other feautures like music and video, is not really worth it. Many of the games on it are variations of PS2 games or games that feel like they belong with a controller and don't really fit in the handheld's realm. Also, to put lots of music and other data on it, you will probably need to buy extra memory sticks since the PSP cannot store much. My friend purchased a PSP for the reasons you are considering, but found that the games weren't all that good, and a simpler MP3 player or iPod was much more suited for things like listening to music. I have used both extensively, and would definitely recommend the Wii over the PSP. I hope that this helps you :)|`|3pmMA1Fxaa	i will get the wii but its hard to get it but with the wii you can get  tired realy fast i have it it comes with wii sports and it has lots of fun games|`|AA12296163	......How can U choose ?!

UXgLuaQnaa	If you have the money, try BasilMarket.com, a MapleStory auction site.  You can find anything there.  Wolbis sell about 5k-10k.  Wooden Tops go for about 50k.  Kumbis are 200k.  Steelies are 5mil..I'm not sure about the other throwing stars, I never really payed attention to them.|`|b9a7c3744d3b5803032522f079f4523baa	You get the Subi ones at the store, the better ones you'll just have to pick up somewhere after killing monsters.

AA10209243	To use a honey tree, fly to Floroma Town.  Go to the northwest corner of the town and go through to the next area (in between the trees).  There is a man above you selling honey.  Unfortunately, you have to purchase honey one at a time...buy 5 or 10 of them.  To use a honey tree, slather it in honey by pressing "A" in front of the tree.  Leave it alone for about 8 hours, come back and press A again.  You will enter a pokemon battle.  There are 5 good honey trees you can do twice a day if you want 10 chances a day (it might take awhile):    1.  Go east from the honey seller.  There is a honey tree right above you.  2.  Go back to Floroma Town and head east into Valley Windworks.  There is a honey tree right near the door.  3.  Fly to Hearthome City.  Go out the west exit, there is a honey tree right below you.  4. Now head for the south exit to Hearthome City.  The is a honey tree to the west.  5. Fly to Solaceon City and head south.  There is a honey tree to the west.    if you see a munchlax or a female combee, catch it!  they are both really rare; (ive heard the ONLY honey tree you can get a munchlax from is the Valley Windworks tree) you can breed them and trade them for some good pokemon on the GTS (breeding the combee is harder, you have to keep trying until you get another female).|`|9UwJxLjVaa	Go to Floroma Town and go to Floroma Medow go talk to the guy at the entrance he sells Honey|`|7Sy2J12Paa	buy honey from the guy in floaroma town|`|sGBnpnVcaa	if u have seen an aipom just go to the GTS and find an aipom. just have the rite pokemon to trade. or u can put up a pokemon for auction and accept the selected pokemon to be traded wit an aipom|`|w8ixtqOOaa	go to floroma and go to the north u should find a place called floroma meadow or somethin like that.talk to the old man n he will give u honey for 100. anyway just to tell ya that when u slather honey on a tree u should give it like around 12 hours to get a rare pokemon n i am not kiddin about the 12 hour thing|`|Kb4TnqIzaa	to get te honey you have to go to flaroama city. then go northwest untill you see a way to a forest. go in and the first man you see sells it to you for $100.

xwuTBAlTaa	Forza Motorsport 2 is a great game at first with different modes that keep you going. Without the multiplayer, this game gets redundant and kinda old in just a short period of time. But, if you really enjoy cars, this is the best game out there right now and the selection of cars and customization is great.    DiRT is rally racing on many surfaces and has a variety of vehicles you can race. It doesn't seem like it's as clean of a game as Forza 2 but you should decide on whether you want to race real cars on pavement or rally cars on dirt and a few other surfaces.|`|OEzpt6iqaa	I don't get into racing games much but I have played Dirt and to tell the truth I kinda liked it.|`|YHAd7qcHaa	dirt.|`|ddDSm6ZIaa	Dirt every thing is more fun off road|`|pOj8Faepaa	nope i disagree because first forza was like 9. something and this one has much better graphics then dirt and has more cars and u can hook up ur cars better its more realistic too|`|yhD9ZdX6aa	Forza motorsport 2 is better than dirt..There are more cars in it and it has better graphics than Dirt =)

xwuTBAlTaa	Yes, it has been released on Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, and Xbox.
xwuTBAlTaa	When you start the game and are connected to Xbox Live, that's what it always says but you will NOT be able to change the weather unless you turn off the live weather feed. If it is on, then once you start the game you look in the top corner and you will see what the weather is.|`|j9QTCht6aa	thats weird     i think     well go to options and u MIGHT find something there
xwuTBAlTaa	Do every practice until you are the starter. Once you are the starter just check in every once in a while on the practices to make sure you are still the starter.     As for the night events, there is no real gameplay here, it's just making a decision for example staying in your dorm and studying (making your GPA rise) or doing an activity with friends or fellow students (making your popularity rise and sometimes having your GPA fall).
xwuTBAlTaa	This is the hardest mission on the game, but have fun with it. Here is IGN's guide that got me past this mission:     What Goes Up    I'll be completely honest; this is the hardest mission in the game, bar none. You WILL be replaying this mission at least 3-5 times if this is the first time you've done it, as there are tons of RPG carrying LC soldiers that need to be killed, multiple LC cars doing damage to your ride, Dax drives like a retard in the second half of the mission (usually doing more damage to the car than anything else), and you have to learn how to lead a RPG shot while driving to take out a moving plane.    Follow the blue path to the airport (via the freeway) and BE CAREFUL. Any damage incurred to your ride on the freeway will worsen any chance you have to finish this mission. It doesn't help that people on the freeway get into random accidents, or that a cop may attempt to pull you over for speeding (and when I say "pull you over", what I mean is "he'll try to ram you off the freeway itself"). Either way, make sure you beat the clock to the blue marker AND keep your car's damage to an extreme minimum.    After a short conversation and a quick cinema, you'll be riding shotgun in Dax's car. Use the RPG to take out any LC cars that are following you, and after you burst through the gate, whip out your K6 assault rifle and target the RPG carrying LC on the ground AND on top of the building. Dax will veer right, and then follow around the right side of the building, which is where you need to pull out your RPG again. As soon as you see Angelo's plane, shoot it. If you lead it (i.e. have the cursor to the far left of the plane so the rocket will hit it) you should be able to land TWO solid RPG shots before Dax takes you off a ramp and over onto the streets.    Dax decides that he needs to go back into the airfield, so he blows through another gate and you have another shot at hitting the plane. If you miss, don't worry about it. Pull out your K6 Assault Rifle and aim for the LC on the right side of the roof as you hit the ramp. Don't shoot at him, but at the barrels next to him (they explode if you put enough bullets into them). After plowing through another fence the area you're looking at is the same spot where you killed the FIRST LC with a RPG (so if you missed the guy on the building, now is the time to kill him). Dax will jock the car to the left, and to the right of the ramp you took to get out on the streets is another LC with a RPG. Drop him and Dax will take a sharp right onto the airfield where you have a CLEAR shot at taking down Angelo's plane with the RPG.    Note: If you do this correctly, you can kill Angelo after you take the first jump out into the city streets, but I described the long way just in case you want to do it for cinematic flair, or if you miss with the RPG a ton. Just don't get too frustrated playing this mission, as it's just gonna take some time to get used too.

oVsv4sNpaa	This is a bit of an opinionated question, but it really is based on what kind of games you're looking for.    The Wii is focused mostly on old school platformers (Super Paper Mario, Super Mario Galaxy, Legend of Zelda) and party games (WarioWare, Big Brain Academy, Mario Party).    The Xbox 360 is focused mostly on shooters (Gears of War, Halo 3, Bioshock), role-playing games (Mass Effect, Blue Dragon), and driving games (Project Gotham Racing, Forza Motorsport).    My personal recommendation would be the Xbox 360, because it has a much more diverse and promising lineup going into the holiday season.|`|AA11029930	ps3 the wii is boring and too complicated|`|dqvvTlYtaa	i would say a wii|`|89oEuqQdaa	i think the psp because it has the internet music and games so its a ipod compiter and a playstation2  AND ITS PORTABLE its graphics may not be top notch but its great for something so small|`|2p5cDdTJaa	Wii hands down

4Rmrn5zWaa	Well, the emulator is ok, but if you mean commercial roms (roms of games you could at one point have bought at the store), they're technically illegal.  Odds are people wouldn't come after you just for downloading a few, but yes, they are still illegal.  Yes, even if you own the game.|`|mebPukR8aa	Legally, you stand no chance of being fined, told to decease downloading, or imprisoned for downloading emulators and roms.  However, you do stand risk of viruses, spam, and pornographic exposure from sites that carry N64 roms and emulators.  Most roms are EPA protected, so finding a site shady enough to have such roms would create a greater risk of coming across said nuisances.    N64 emulators are also much harder to play games on than the real thing, do to lack of analog controls and sometimes awkward button layouts.  You'd be better off buying game carts online.    If you do wish to obtain roms, here is the best site:  http://www.emuparadise.org/roms/n64/    This site is best for an emulator:  http://www.zshare.net/download/210901a93...    Hopefully I will save you from ruining your computer looking for an OoT rom. :)

The chances of getting a Feebas are very high now. Female feebas are kinda rare. So it might take you a couple tries to get 1.      Also, if you use the good rod the chances of Feebas showing are only 38.791444444 lol yea I'm the math maniac.|`|lumVDZXtaa	Get a life buddy. JK! Ummm... I think you can get it from a trade...

It is really down to luck to catch one.
ibgPiMFcaa	The game takes place in "forget-me-not-valley." If you are concerned about doing well in the game then you should not be concerned that you cant leave because it really doesnt matter for gameplay. I have been playing for a while and I still cannot leave the valley, and I have not felt the need to.     However, if you are still interested then while I am not entirely sure how to unlock mineral town, I believe that if you get the game "Harvest moon, friends of mineral town" and put it in the front slot of your DS while you still have "harvest moon ds" in the rear slot then after you start the game it will unlock mineral town. It was designed for the dedicated harvest moon fans so that they could still incorporate "friends of mineral town."
ibgPiMFcaa	There are a few requirements before you can marry one of the girls in the game. First, you need to have the big bed which you buy through the sprite shopping network. Second, you need to have returned the harvest goddess, which means you have to bring 60 sprites back *I think*. If you have those requirements taken care of then you probably need to go on that date in the summer.
iM0K6qV7aa	i'm not sure if you mean PS2 or for the PC well i have played for days and stuff well not days without sleep but you know what i mean, and the only helpful advice that i can give you is let them get older and maybe the kids can grow up and maybe you'll be able to pass it.
mXhFXIdIaa	I love My ds and have had it for a while now.   Definitely plus it will play all your Gba games as well.   the touchscreen is really fun to use and can make the difference in a game. And dont worry the touch screen stylus is included with a spare.  I had alot of fun with Mario kart and also Pokemon pearl was pretty fun not as fun the other Pokemon games though and my favorite ds games so far are Super mario 64 ds and Mario&Luigi Partners In Time.   . A lite will cost $130 and games new range from $25 to $35 and used $15 to $20. So $200 to $235 total. It's a great system and in my opinion definitely worth it.     So to sum it up its a great system and much better than psp which also costs more its very fun especially the touchscreen and seeing a game on two screens I definitely think you should buy it. it very fun and has a great library of games. And the option to play multiplayer with somone who doesn't own the game is great. It a great value and if you have enough go and buy it. In the long run used games are great if your short on cash have enough to buy 2 used game but only one new game . If you buy alot of games or travel on long car rides you might want a case thay can be very cheap it fun to play and great thing to bring in the car although some people may get annoyed by the noise but all headphones work.   ps. i play my ds all the time :)   its a great system buy it now|`|wkaGocsaaa	yea you should get it.|`|HAdXvf3maa	I have one and it's Great! I would get it if i where you. Unless you're into action games. It does'nt have alot of those.

The ps3 wil be the crushing system soon if youll buy a couple games now then wait until 2008 ps3 will pay off but another ps3 price drop is rumored before holiday when 60gb will run out and 80gb will be all available just a rumor. some games for 360 soon HALO 3, bioshock, mass effect gta4 for both plus madden and stuff for both. Ps3 heavenly sword, lair, killzone 2, mgs4, C. O. D. 4 for both ps3 again rise of argonauts, Beowulf, Turning point: Fall Of Liberty, blacksite area 51, and Ratchet and clank both stranglehold. Ps3 will have all the good games soonand bluray will won. now the stuff you really want.     The ps3 has much more space with bluray notice unlike x360 no insert disc 2 signs with games like lair 25gigs. with amazing graphics and the powerful cell some good games out now the darkness, resistance fall of man ( favorite ps3 game so far), the Bigs Multiplatform and gutair hero ps3 will have wireless controller. it a great system i have it and play it alot free online is great with all downloads and Warhawk will be available on psn full and on bluray with extra video and bluetooth headset. and dont worry son predicts 10 yearlifecycle and of course all the great ps2 titles perfectly compatible.       X360 premium plus you need 20 gig hardrive if you play alot or elite DONT BUY CORE. has great game library due to year headstart and just recently a price drop games cost 60.00 as do on ps3 as well with the blockbuster HALO 3 and good games like too human xbox live is great but 50$ yearly if you want to actually do something in xbox live. with alot videos and tv shows/movies is agreat feature.     Im gonna have to say ps3 though with soon to be better games it will be worth it and sixasis is good on certain games lair you will fly dragon with it. it has great dvd format with more space for bigger games on asingle disc plus stranglehold comes with movie. with plenty of games coming soon november septem well fall will have plenty of games for every system plus alot for ps3. so go with ps3 in my opinion i love mine. And a close call but in the end is much better especially once the devolopers know what theyre working with for even better games with better graphics and planty of exclusive and timed exclusive.     Hope this helped i have alot of experiance in this subject hope this essay well it long enogh to be an essay helps you decide. :)     dude i almost forget Home it a coming ps3 feature where you can walk around make your house meet other people earn trophies and invite them to imediate jump in to games good for multiplayer. and also littlebigplanet you make your own levels and have these awsomely cute human creature things go from one end to the other also you can play as litle ppl as well. so hands down    The PS3     Source(s):    psm, personal experience, alot of gaming, me|`|tcrbQyMnaa	ps3 is better though, but if you really want a xbox 360 then get one man|`|e2RxYv1laa	WELL EF U HIVE A PS3 AND LIEK TEW TLAK EN CAPS OBVIUSLY U LIEK TEH PS3 MORE|`|ETQWnWvDaa	the xbox360 is way better than the ps3.ps3 SUCKS I HAVE ONE AND IDONT USE THE SYSTEM ANYMORE BECAUSE SUCKS.so just get the xbox360.|`|M6XhplA3aa	I Think Xbox 360 is better because its made by Microsoft.|`|9htPD9wJaa	The ps3 looks better and doesn't need the add on's like the xbox 360 does if u want wireless or the blue ray player or other things like that and if you buy the add ons with the 360 its going to be the same price as the ps3 and i think the ps3 has sharper graphics to but not sure.|`|4ac1d65fbeeae2dc584df9ab9b6abecbaa	The 360 is better.  Better games, equal graphics, Blu ray is over rated and you will get Xbox Live which is the greatest on line system. Even PS3 fanboys can't argue against that.|`|KFZRGeoNaa	PS3.|`|xOemNB6Yaa	i have an xbox 360 it's 200 dollars cheaper than ps3|`|85ef8c9710ab2174a2e9ea58eeeda9b7aa	PS3!! because aside from those wonderful games, it has a built in blu-ray player:)
iM0K6qV7aa	i would go with sturdy because you will come across some Pokemon with some crazy powerful moves that will knock your Pokemon right out! so by having the sturdy ability you will be protected from that and if they lower your accuracy you can always switch your Pokemon out and then back in again.|`|AA12225844	I recommend keen eye. Because in the entire game, the sturdy is useless in the entire game because none of the trainers there dont have 1 hit KO attacks (except if your also playing cable with your friends). however, the keeneye helps your skarmory prevents missed attacks. hope this helps
2p5cDdTJaa	and I thought Banjo Twoie was a bad title, never could beat that game...the first one was easy though|`|za3h9mqOaa	I liked the old, retro graphics. It leaves far more to the imagination; which is what the B&K series is all about. The new graphics are too defined and less cartoony.

Im gonna have to say ps3 though with soon to be better games it will be worth it and sixasis is good on certain games lair you will fly dragon with it. it has great dvd format with more space for bigger games on asingle disc plus stranglehold comes with movie. with plenty of games coming soon november septem well fall will have plenty of games for every system plus alot for ps3. so go with ps3 in my opinion i love mine. And a close call but in the end is much better especially once the devolopers know what theyre working with for even better games with better graphics and planty of exclusive and timed exclusive.     Hope this helped i have alot of experiance in this subject hope this essay well it long enogh to be an essay helps you decide. :)     dude i almost forget Home it a coming ps3 feature where you can walk around make your house meet other people earn trophies and invite them to imediate jump in to games good for multiplayer. and also littlebigplanet you make your own levels and have these awsomely cute human creature things go from one end to the other also you can play as litle ppl as well. so hands down    The PS3     Source(s):    psm, personal experience, alot of gaming, me|`|6ee81c35b55c82bfa1c8b50df137f3b5aa	well depends on the type of 360 if it's a pro console then PS3 but if it's a elite then the elite would be best.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98qC0fd_...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZQA2zGih...    jk|`|uogvr1NZaa	PS3 because the graphics are way better than xbox 360 and it has a blue ray player and there cheaper and more affordable now.  I just sent in my xbox 360 for the second time and Im going through my third xbox.  The xbox is full of problems and gliches and its a pain to deal with.  My 360 ruined and scratched my Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawks Project 8, and Madden 07.  I would get a PS3 and just wait a couple months because there are tons of games coming out for it this year and they have way better graphics then the Xbox 360.|`|SkYLrMy7aa	for games-xbox  ps3 is nice cuz it has blu-ray|`|eU0d9u6Kaa	360|`|Gva3Bwkpaa	I personally think that the 360 is better, because it has all the really good games, where as ps3 has some games but only a few of them are good, plus the 360 just lowered in price to $350 for the premium system, and the ps3 is still $500 for 60 gigs, and $600 for 80 gigs|`|tcrbQyMnaa	I think the PS3 is the best system out of any the three game systems because of    A) Free online, which is also improving quite a bit    B) Is somewhat cheaper than the Xbox 360    PS3:-----------Xbox 360:    60gb PS3-$500 -----------Xbox 360 Elite- $479  HDMI slot-Free---------HDMI slot- Only with Elite  Wifi-Free ----------Wifi- $99  Rechargeable Controllers-Free --------Recharge Kit- $20  Online-Free -----------Online- $50 a year  Blu-Ray Player-Free---------------HDDV... Player- $179    Total: $500 ----------------Total: $827     You might not use these accessories, so thats why I say the PS3 is somewhat cheaper    C) Has great exclusives coming out:  Heavenly Sword, Lair, Eight Days, Warhawk, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Online, Killzone 2, Grand Turismo 5, Little Big Planet, Getaway 3, Driver 5, God of War III, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy Versus XIII, Jax and Daxter: Lost Frontier, Motorstorm, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Resistance: Fall of Man, SOCOM: Confrontation, Tekken 6, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, and White Knight Story. Thats all the games I can think of over 5 minutes.    D) The PS3 is superior due to cell technology. This allows the PS3 to produce complex graphics far superior to any other console. The ps3 is equivalent to 2 xbox 360 in processing speed. The down side is however that it will be a while until game producers can max its potential because the cell processor is somewhat new in technology. Thats why games on the xbox 360 look somewhat better. However, in about a year or two the PS3 will have better graphics. This is somewhat good too because then Sony wont have to make another console as soon, but yet nobody knows what technology can come to in 5 years    E) PS3 will probably be the better quality as in life span. Many Xbox 360 are already having hardware problems (25%-33% xbox 360 have 3 red rings of death) when there has only been a reported 1% failure chance with the PS3. PS3 also has an emergency shut down feature, so if you PS3 overheats it will automatically shutdown until it is out of a dangerous temperature.    360 isnt bad, but PS3 is way better for the cost|`|RjQcxQ84aa	PS3|`|9ueVA39Waa	x360 cos ps3 is not worth the money at all. xbox is releasing an elite version which has a 120gb hard drive now anyway.|`|5JlXeenxaa	I personally think that the PS3 is better... I own an Xbox 360, and I get bored with it really quick... the games are fun and all, but the stories just don't really grab you... you know what I mean?    I think that the PS3 will, in the long run, be the better of the two...    Right now there isn't much games out for the PS3, but pretty soon they'll start piling up, and plus it's sony... so you can expect games like Sly cooper, Jak and Daxter, Kingdom Hearts, and other GREAT games too!      And Drake's Fortune: Uncharted is gonna be AMAZING!!!!!!!

ibgPiMFcaa	I am not sure if you are talking about the PC, PS2 or DS version of Harvest Moon, but I will assume you were talking DS. There are two games that I have played on it that are similar to Harvest Moon: Animal Crossing, and Lost in Blue. Also, there is a new Harvest moon coming out tomorrow (Aug. 14th) that should will be sweet. Its called Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest moon     So if you really liked harvest moon, and are looking for another similar game to play, I would just wait a day and get the new one.|`|OZ0DgzrJaa	There not many games as laid back as Harvest Moon.

ibgPiMFcaa	I believe that Keira lives on the 255 floor of the third mine. In order to break the big rock at the bottom of the second mine, all you have to do is to kill all the monsters, and the rock will break. This will allow you to open up the third mine to persue Keira.

ibgPiMFcaa	The goddess pond is the pond above the big harvest sprite tree in the upper right portion of the map.     However, if you are trying to trigger the purple heart scene with Celia, I was able to trigger it by walking toward the pond, and not actually being there. What you should do is go out of your house and then turn toward your right like your going to go over the little bridge, but instead of going over the bridge, you should head north up the path. When you cross from one screen to the other is when the scene should trigger. Try doing this around 5:00 pm, and hopefully it should work.
n0Hj5cl8aa	http://www.gamesradar.com/us/ds/game/faq...    The home shopping channel sells various items and you can buy one each    week.  These items enhance the functionality of your house and allow you    to achieve other goals in the game.  You can buy one item each week.      Watch the second channel on the harvest sprite stations and look for    items that you can purchase.  You will be able to tell if you can buy    something because they ask for a currency called Karbos that you don't    have and cannot spend.  The rest of the items are just there for comical    effect and to pass the time between items you can buy.  Once you see an    item you want, use the phone to order it between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm.     Thomas will deliver the item to you in 2 to 3 days.  You need to but    several items to unlock the ability to upgrade the house.  Some items    are only available after you upgrade your house.         You will need the second house upgrade to get the kitchen.    House: You begin the game with a small house and you can expand it    twice.  Your house is indestructible and constructed of lumber.  You    cannot expand it using other materials.  Once you unlock the second    harvest sprite channel, and buy a few items from the TV shopping    network.  The option to expand your house becomes available from Gotz.     You can expand your house twice, which is necessary to open new items to    buy from the home shopping network. You need to buy the table before you    can get the first upgrade and the kitchen before you can buy the second.    It is also required to get married later in the game.   You get the first upgrade by buying an item from the supermarket everyday for 10 days. Then you buy the upgrade from gotz.      Good luck and best wishes!|`|ibgPiMFcaa	The kitchen takes a while to get. The first thing you need to do is make sure that you have unlocked the harvest sprite shopping network (Channel 2). This is done by buying something from the supermarket everyday for 10 days. After you have accomplished this, you need to keep watching the network and items will become available. Just buy all the things that you can and then the kitchen will show up. You also need to have Gotz build you a house upgrade so that the kitchen will fit in your house. This option will become available after you have unlocked the shopping network.     Basically, get both the house upgrades and then watch to buy it on the harvest sprite shopping network.

Sabes, no s si a ti te paso alguna vez. Pero resulta que yo ped un juguete especifico que se llamaba super laberinto, y lo srs. reyes magos me trajeron otro.    Tambin se llamaba laberinto pero no era el que yo haba solicitado, entonces pues al principio no me causo ninguna emocin especial. Pero "pues era el que haba llegado as que haba que jugar con l no?"    Entonces resulta que esa fue la razn para abrirlo y probarlo.     El juguete era muy sencillo, una plataforma llena de hoyitos amarrada a una palanquilla que le hacia moverse en los cuatro sentidos arriba, abajo, derecha, izquierda. En el centro ponas un baln y con el movimiento de la palanca el baln se deslizaba y tenias que hacer que esquivar los hoyitos. Cada que caas en un hoyito el baln salia y te deca cuantos puntos habas conseguido.     Pues yo no s si se siga fabricando dicho juego, pero hasta el da de hoy ni el nintendo, ni el play, ni nada; recuerdo me haya tenido tan entretenido durante tanto tiempo, sin gasto de luz, ni pilas, ni nada que da?e el ambiente.

mOTCr8Pxaa	EV training is a way to affect stats to get a desired result. Every pokemon has 510 ev "slots" and for every 4 filled in one stat that stat will go up by 1 overall. Usually ev training isn't really noticed until you get to higher levels. You can put a maximun of 255 (252 most effective) ev's into one stat. You cannot ev train pokemon already used in battle. The pokemon has to be fresh, never used in battle at all to be effectively trained. For every pokemon you beat gives out a certain type and amount of ev's. Serebii.net has a list on it's pokedex of what gives out what. Macho brace doubles ev gain, pokerus doubles ev gain, and the power items add 4 to a stat no matter what pokemon you battle and is affected by pokerus.<br>  <br>  Edit: Winter is a dumbass. I can't say it nicer as that's what was going through my mind. If you battle a bidof you get 1hp ev. If you attach macho brace you get two. Same goes for pokerus. If you attach the macho brace and have pokerus you will get 4 ev's. If a pokemon gives two then it would be 4 then 8 respectively. And the math is the same even if you switch the pokemon out.|`|AA12071039	Each Pokemon provides a specific EV an a specific amount of EVs.<br>  <br>  Example: A Bidoof provides 1 HP effort value.<br>  If you battle four Bidoof during one level, and you level up, You get 1 additional HP effort value.<br>  <br>  If you battle 400 Bidoofs in one level, you get 100 HP effort values.<br>  <br>  You can have a maximum of 250 effort values in all.<br>  <br>  Use them wisely.|`|JFjcLsRDaa	i ev train all my pokemon but its hard to explain, hope this helps<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2240362_ev-train-pokemon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2240362_ev-train...</a>

O problema  achar um bom programa, por isso sugiro que voc procure pelo DER BRINGER, que tem um rating mximo estimado em 2400, e o CRAFTY, que deve passar dos 2500. O problema do Crafty  que ele n?o tem interface grfica, mas voc pode rod-lo na plataforma GNU e ele funcionar muito bem. O Der Bringer, embora mais fraco em nvel de jogo, tem interface grfica e  bastante simples de usar. Todos os programas que mencionei (Crafty, Bringer e GNU) s?o freewares e livres de vrus na origem.

dJia4yaLaa	L'cran infrieur de la DS Lite ragit au toucher fournissant ainsi une exprience de jeu qu'aucune autre console portable n'est capable de fournir.    Vous pouvez notamment utiliser le stylet DS inclus avec la console pour crire des chiffres sur l'cran tactile dans le Programme d'Entra?nement Crbral du Dr Kawashima, quel age a votre cerveau ? ou inscrire des annotations sur vos dcouvertes dans The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Vous pouvez faire des dessins et les envoyer  vos amis, contr?ler l'action  l'cran avec encore plus de prcision qu'avant ou naviguer instantanment  travers les menus du bout des doigts. Cette nouvelle technologie signifie que vous jouerez d'une toute nouvelle manire, que ce soit en contr?lant Samus Aran dans Metroid Prime Hunters ou en caressant le ventre des chiots de Nintendogs.    Le stylet se range sur le flanc de la console et l'cran tactile dispose d'un film protecteur pour une dure de vie maximale.    La Nintendo DS Lite comporte un microphone qui permet de communiquer avec d'autres joueurs via connexion Wi-Fi Nintendo dans certains jeux et d'interagir avec les jeux de toutes nouvelles manires ! Apprenez  votre chiot  excuter des tours au son de votre voix dans Nintendogs ou soufflez sur le microphone pour balayer la poussire d'un vieil objet dans Hotel Dusk: Room 215 pour rsoudre une nigme. Certains jeux comme Metroid Prime: Hunters et Puzzle League DS permettent mme de parler  d'autres joueurs durant une partie via connexion Wi-Fi Nintendo, mme si les joueurs se trouvent  des kilomtres les uns des autres.      pour ta notice tu la trouvera sur ce lien  http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloa...|`|c1f1a3e4c0fb56091fb862487f46f87aaa	pour certains jeux tu  dois dire des mots comme "papier"etc., il est integr et le jeux te previens qd tu dois parler, c facile|`|73381M31aa	prout tchoum tchoum!|`|beDloQ2aaa	Il y a un petit micro qui est incorpor directement dans la DS.

dz8Nd9vOaa	I recommend playing the game to the point where you know all of the maps.  When you recognize all the maps, you won't run out aimlessly to where someone can kill you. It's all about stealth buddy. Find a good spot to shoot, know when to get ready to shoot when walking around a corner, and learn from others. Watch where other people are shooting from or running towards. Good luck|`|0L5wlQlJaa	ok, i would switch with an SMG. Either the Mini uzi, P-90 or MP5.  would personally recommend the P-90 with red dot sight (if you are level 40+) if your not go with the MP5 with red dot sight. For the perks, I use 3x frags, stopping power, martyrdom.  I'm waiting to get the desert eagle.     So when I play i use   P-90 w/ red dot  M9 (side arm)    perks:  stopping power (sumtimes I switch this out w/ overkill and use the dragunov with the M9). I WILL switch the dragunov with the barett .50 cal. When I reach level freakin 49 or 50 or whtevr it was!)  Martyrdom  3x frags|`|l27zURMnaa	People will tell you to practice or have a friend help you, Im telling you to cheat. that m14 is great imagine it full auto. as well as pistols and G3 go to xboxscene rapid fire mod. Gives the worst gamer an edge|`|zEuakaCSaa	not exactly sure what you need help with. If it's just being better at the game itself then it's simply practice.    Try all of the weapons out and see what you are better at using. some prefer to get up close and personal, so use the SMG type weapons for quick bursts, or the shotguns for brute force, some prefer to keep their distance, so will go with the sniper rifle.    I, personally, like to do a little bit of both, and find the perfect weapon to be the M16. Once you reach level 10, or 11, whatever one unlocks the red dot sight, then add this to the weapon. It makes life a lot easier.    Just keep on playing!!!|`|UXgLuaQnaa	What can I say? Just keep playing and hopefully you'll get better eventually, with practice. Make sure you play with people of different skill levels too...you'll never get any better if you always play against sucky people, y'know?|`|E41cmTiiaa	There are two guns and attachments put together on your details, for one: The M4 Carbine with the ACOG Scope, then the other gun the M14.

It all comes from experience so keep at it .

It wouldn't matter, the process of signing simply takes a couple minutes, and it's free.    Sorry if this is breaking any of your rules, but I was just wondering.
bKmzZSMcaa	Okay, firstly, everyone gets a free petpet for your neopet when signing up, so unless u wanna waste your money then u buy other petpet. next, the petpet is not a living thing, it is just a plushie or toy to let your pet play with. so, again, there no need to buy supplies unless u wanna waste your $.  it will always be around with your neopet like a doll.  so the use is to let your neopet to play with it. IT is FUN!!|`|2fviNnJtaa	They are kinda like cards, not really useful, but fun.

rb72ED56aa	There is NOT GOING TO BE A GAME CALLED KINGDOM HEARTS 3 (as said by the third user)   When I went to Anime Fest '08, Disorganization XIII said it themselves, no game is going to be called KH3. The games are going to be released on the PSP, DS, and Mobile Phone. I do not think it's being released on the PS3. If I remember correctly, they said if it would to come out on the PS3, it'd be in like 2011.  So the games are:  Coded  365/2 days (and when we were there, we called it Random Numbers/2 game lol)  Birth By Sleep.  I do not think the games start off with Sora, Riku, and Kiari.  One game I know for sure that's coming out at the end of the year is on December 12th, which would be Kingdom Hearts Re: CoM.  Either th e2nd or the 12th. (Go to GameStop and check the book thing that shows upcoming releases on your PS2.)  Knock yourself out and go to  http://www.disorganization-xiii.com  and see if you find anything else.

AA11687863	Chain of Memories is a direct sequel to the first Kindom Hearts.    Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories is a remake of Kingdom Hearts sequel, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. It is packaged with Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix+ on a separate disc. A few changes has been done prior the remake's release.    A U.S. release was confirmed by Square Enix for December 2nd, 2008. It will be in PS2 format and will not be related to Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix+ (which never was released outside Japan) in any way. It will be sold for $30.    It will be the same as the original, with new things added in, such as:        * New Cards are available.      * Riku gains a new sleight which allows him to perform a combo with King Mickey.      * Reaction commands are implemented from Kingdom Hearts II.      * A special command, card duel (card breaking) allows player to break stacks of opponents cards in a specific time and inflict massive damage. This is only available to Riku.      * Battles now take form in 3D, and objects in rooms can fire projectiles, inflict damage or initiate battles when hit.      * In Reverse/Rebirth, when Riku finally accepts both his light and dark side during the fight with Zexion in Destiny Islands, he is constantly in Dark-mode.      * There is also a new version of Trinity Limit that can be accessed by stocking Goofy first; in this sleight, Sora and Donald, who use Goofy as a battering ram, run around bashing into enemies.      * Glide is now included in Sora's story.      * There are now map card premiums and wild map cards which could redeem any value.      * Lexaeus can go into a temporary state of power and invulnerability, similar to the battle in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix.      * The Riku Replica sometimes enters a battle with an orb of dark energy in his left hand.      * Whenever Sora enters a world that changes his appearance, he changes into his form for that world.      * Pluto is a party character in Sora's Story.     and many others.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories takes place directly after the ending of the first game, Kingdom Hearts. Sora and his friends Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket are walking down a winding path when a mysterious man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears. He directs Sora towards a massive fortress called Castle Oblivion and then disappears. When the travelers enter, they find the mysterious figure again. When Sora and his companions attempt to engage the figure, they find that their abilities seem to have no effect. The figure explains that they forgot all of their abilities when they entered the castle. He continues by creating a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories. The higher they go, the more memories they will lose in the process.    Meanwhile, floors below, Riku has been transported from the realm of darkness and fights his personal demons as he battles upward from the basement levels of Castle Oblivion. Neither Riku nor Sora are aware that they are being manipulated by a mysterious group called the Organization. Marluxia, the Organization's lord of Castle Oblivion and the figure who led Sora and his friends there, plans to control Sora with the memory-altering powers of a girl named Namin and use him to overthrow the rest of the Organization. The Organization members Zexion and Lexaeus catch wind of this plot and seek to counter Marluxia using Riku as their pawn. As Riku ascends Castle Oblivion, he, like Sora, encounters various members of the Organization. Vexen fights Riku to obtain his data and creates a replica of him. The replica embraces the darkness and believes himself to be stronger. After the Riku Replica battles Riku and flees, Vexen decides to use the replica against Sora, after reworking the replica's memory with Namin's powers.    As Sora ascends through the castle, he battles Larxene, a co-conspirator in Marluxia's plot. Afterwards, he appears to remember Namin as an old friend of his. He learns that she is being held in the castle, and continues to ascend, clashing with the Riku Replica who now believes himself to be the real Riku. After witnessing the death of Vexen and killing Larxene, Sora learns about his shifting memories and Marluxia's plans from Namin; Axel, another Organization member who serves as a double agent, had allowed Namin to meet Sora to foil Marluxia's plans. Sora forms an alliance with the Riku Replicawho discovers that his memory was also altered by Naminand they fight to the top of the castle and defeat Marluxia. Namin then puts Sora and his friends into pod-like machines to help them regain the memories they lost in the castle, even though they would forget the events that transpired in the castle.    As this occurs above, Ansem, who took over Riku's body in the previous game, attempts to regain control of Riku below, but is continually thwarted with the intervention of King Mickey. On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, who uses his dying strength to force Riku's darkness to the surface; he nearly succeeds, but the King saves and revives Riku as Sora defeats Marluxia. Later, Riku confronts Zexion, who sees Riku as a threat now that Marluxia has been eliminated, and seeks to dispose of him, but Riku embraces his darkness and overcomes him. Arriving in Twilight Town, Riku meets DiZ, an enigmatic man interested in Riku and sends him to speak with Namin, but the Riku Replica, who now seeks to justify his existence, fights Riku. After eliminating the Replica, Riku learns from Namin that what remains of Ansem lives in his heart. Riku chooses to face him and DiZ pulls Ansem from Riku's heart to battle. After defeating Ansem, Riku learns that as long as he has darkness at his command, Ansem still resides within him. He sets out with King Mickey as his companion.    |`|wt7sA9ujaa	Its gonna be the gba game except 3d, but i do think theyre adding stuff to it.|`|8c34517b146df925d22739f6784ac70daa	chain of memories will connect kingdom hearts 1 and kingdom hearts 2.  it takes place between kh1 and kh2. the gameplay is different though (uses card system for attacking).     instead of using the attack button or magic u will use card instead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfsZsMzbj...  btw you get to play as riku and sora

918a7edf66b7975b5026246c4c82a70baa	erm...there are 3 ways...  1) learn russian  2) get the manual book (whihc i hope its in english, and if lucky, have screenshots of the main menu and options thingy) and try to 'guess' your way though.  3) return it and says its in russian.    Or you could forget about the ga,e and play a banjo! (or take banjo lessons).
