20090307065418AAoMHxO	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Hypothetical situation?	As we all know, when a Question or Answer is Reported, it is reviewed in great detail by a YA moderator who weighs the pros and cons thoughtfully before making a decision; "To delete or not delete, that is the question..?"      And as we also know, a user's success rate % is based on how many Best Answers he gets divided by how many Questions he's Answered. In English: The percent is higher when the user has answered less questions he didn't win.      So hypothetically: A user could go around marking all the Questions he didn't win in an attempt to raise his %. Mark everything and get 100%. But since the YA moderators are so frugle with their moderation, they would NEVER remove any Questions or Answers without good reason. Basically the entire dog and pony show relies on the Moderation process being fair, objective, and competent.      Does this sounds about right, eh?

20090307073117AAw8pFu	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Any ideas what this could be?  What questions should I ask my doctors?	Ok. I've been sick since June. I'm 21 and otherwise in pretty good shape. I went to the doctor after having nausea and stomach pain that wouldn't go away, with really intense bouts of severe pain at night. I've been to the ER five times thinking something had burst or twisted or something. I've had all the gall bladder tests done, had a endoscopy to look for ulcers or anything like that, stool samples, blood tests, and I just had a laproscopy done looking for endometriosis. No one has found anything and my doctors don't know what to do next.      The weirdest thing is that this pain and nausea follows my menstrual cycle-it starts when I ovulate and gets worse until my period is over. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? I feel like my doctors are close to giving up and I just want some answers. Any suggestions I could give my doctors? Thanks.
