nHhQ952Kaa	Sounds like she doesn't want to be friends anymore, and if your in seventh grade and are just now going through that then you have a far less complicated life than me but if we're at all alike you have a lot more of these situations to go through.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	she has grow out of your friendship..dump her or confront her in front of the people she is making fun of you with..I am sure as soon as you are out of earshot she make all kinds of nasty comments about you
7OTJW7fAaa	You are obviously preoccupied with other things and are not paying attention to all the people and things around you.  You need to call and apologize once again and try to arrange to meet with your best friend outside of church and confirmation class so you can get some best friend time together.  If she has an email address, you might try sending her an apology card.|`|az3pEbglaa	as long as you didn't mean to do it. i mean if she were really your friend she wouldn't get mad at just a dumb thing like that. tell her you're sorry and you don't tend to see her when you walk past.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Set up dates outside of church! Maybe you'll recognize her more :P
GqhtePhgaa	Tell her that people who don't share a dream or thrive on competition can never ever understand what drives her to be the way she is.  You're right, she should be proud of her reaching for her goals.  People on the outside can only judge you to their standards.  But she shouldn't let their judgement get to her because they just really have no clue or perspective.  They'll tell her that what she does is dumb, won't get her anywhere, won't be useful later in life, etc.      Forget that.  She should go for her dream.  If she doesn't, she'll always wonder if she could have reached it.  And that is worse than trying and failing.    Good luck!
az3pEbglaa	aha great! if it's a:  GIRL:  *stuffs bra  *has done "it"  *flirts with teachers  *is lesbian    GUY[i don't really know]|`|1OxiOk2taa	First off I don't recommend starting drama! It is wrong and what is the point? It causes tension and confusion. But if you really need this question answered pull dirty pranks, start rumors, blackmail ext... but I don't reccomend it|`|BNBKVpz2aa	Start a rumor Lol|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	School is hard enough why do you want to start a drama?   How about trying to act a bit more mature & concentrate on yr schooling.|`|CFU77qCbaa	Say that the nerd is like "Omg the nerd is going out with one of the cool guys.!" lol|`|oVtvjSVJaa	Your lucky it doesn't just follow you like it does me! Anyway, starting a rumor is a great way for beginners. When you really get into the situation, start jumbling and mixing up information with different people. Icing on the cake is blaming different people and saying that you have no clue how you even got tied into this mess!             Your Welcome~                Twilight Princess|`|fc4U6217aa	HAHAHA!!!!I love drama...a little spice in your life...but take it from me...dont...it will backfire and you will look like an idiot...unless your moving out of the state...dont...

c99af49c6f44addcd0c8da1340c70d91aa	I think you have it all wrong my friend. Most nascar fans are white, between the ages of 24-35 years old and have an average income around 30-50k. And that my friend is the core of the united states. Your relying on to many stereotypes of nascar fans. I never went to a race and i had the same views you do, then 3 years ago i went to my first live nascar race at las vegas and i have been hooked ever since, and i look at the racers and the people who come to these races in a whole new light. Have you ever been to a race, if the answer is no then don't judge it till you try it, you just might find out the smell of gas, rubber and speed to be great like i did.
LYVDtbFZaa	You have every right to be annoyed. I was really close to someone like that once. I didn't say anything to her because when she wasn't lying or trying to get attention, she was a  really fun person to be around. Eventually I stopped trusting her altogether and now we're not even friends. she actually left one day and i don't know where she is or if she ever coming back but even if i did it still wouldn't make a difference because i couldn't trust her then and i will never be able to. In my opinion  you should be honest with her. maybe it will make her realize what she's doing|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	You are right and behavior such as your friends can be annoying.  Your friend is crying out for attention and needs counseling.  What's going on with her at home?
sknSVTGnaa	forget about her. She isn't a good friend. Shes known you longer then her bf so she shouldn't be ditching you. I say she isn't worth the trouble so just try to start hanging out with other people and ignore her like shes been doing to you|`|AA10183476	you need to keep friends with you no matter what. if you were friends with her for that long. you need her. i am in the same situation and you can never lose a bestfriend. you need them there.|`|HZubplhvaa	Try to ignore it, if you have other friends. If not, then try to talk to her again. Ask her about her boyfriend, about her relationship with him. Try to seem interested.  And if she doesn't feed into it, if she still seems to not care, then ignore her. Forget her.
dZxjXHA2aa	Well you have the perfect chance to get them talking because you have to work in groups.  Just be friendly, smile a lot, introduce yourself when you're in the group, and make jokes about stuff in the class and stuff like you would with your friends.  By the end of the semester, I think you'll be shocked by how many 10th and 12th graders are smiling and saying hi to you in the halls!!|`|i4ceTwqLaa	What a perfect class to meet people in!    So much to talk about! You know, people love to have their work critiqued. And people that love art LOVE to talk about their favorite artists and pieces....    For example, there are really great sites on the internet where you can do some VERY sophisticated photo editing.     I would recommend starting a conversation based on the work you are assigned! Such an easy subject to broach with a stranger.     Go for it!!    :)|`|YfTMBFIIaa	Just talk to the sophomores!  Trust me, we don't bite.  I'm sure that there are some sophomores who like mature upperclassmen. (I love them) and will be open to being friends.      Don't worry about it to much though....I am sure that they really aren't all that bad, and after some time your group will have established some inside jokes.  Then you won't feel so alone.|`|PeAqoy1vaa	Just try to make friends with the other students. Just because they're in a different grade doesn't mean they're weird.|`|PBe2qbXNaa	they are not going to talk to you!!! get over it and start talking to them....what is the worse thing that could happen...kill you? talk to them and you will be fine. BE BRAVE!!!|`|wcB91DUTaa	Well, try and make friends with some of the people in that class.  It's easy, just say hi to them and act friendly. Its easier than it sounds-but u won't know until you try it.    I have that same problem sometimes. Ik it may be hard, but try and expand your social self. Talk, start some conversation with ppl.    Wish you best of luck.|`|j7XHvaoYaa	talk to the seniors! theyre cooler. start a convo!!!!!!!sation any way youd normally talk to someone. likee... i like your camera lolololol|`|RCIrU23laa	I know what you mean. Try your best to open up & be more talkative to people. Say "Hi" to classmates that sit next to you or near you. Make a remark of their attire. I usually start off like with a remark like that. You can also ask your classmate why they have chosen to take photography as an elective. That is one thing you have in common with everyone in your class.
6QfQVuPuaa	Why are you making it so confusing??    If you like her then confess and let the things happen automatically!!    Honey if u like her does'nt mean he has to like u too. so please let him know by taking ur decision, and let him take his own decision.    Don't leave a statement for future : " I wish if I would have............"    do it now!|`|9QfwT8Wvaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...
jpbychDAaa	AWWWW.  You are very sweet. But really, just go about being her friend the way you would go about being friends with anyone. Talk to her, make a joke about something the teacher says. If she's shy, it might take a while before she's comfortable enough with you for you two to be friends, but it'll be worth it.   Best of luck! |`|3QIoa38Naa	You seem like a good guy.  Ask her to sit with you at lunch?  Make her laugh.  Maybe share a band or a book you really like with her.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	You will not sound like a f@g if you befriend someone who is in need of someone to give them company, it will make you cool, so do it and get frozen (positive encouragement, not an insult).|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Just go talk to her.
qZNcqM4Uaa	ask people about themselves. people loooove to talk about themselves.   i.e. How was your weekend? How are you? Do you like this class? how has your day been?      notice what they wear, guys especially, maybe they are wearing a shirt for a team you recognize, maybe strike up a convo about the team they support.  i.e did you watch the Blah v.s Blah game over the weekend?    some other things you can try:  what'd you think of that test?  did u see that movie over the weekend?   isnt' that teacher crazy? did you see what he/she did?|`|sFASHCNRaa	ask questions! people LIKE talking about themselves, its just the way humans are! :D    and add feedback too!
NOKScSJqaa	FYI u are 14... ;)  that's ur answer, wait and grow when u are supposed to grow...  and enough with boys, u're only 14! u pervert!|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Act cool. Don't let them see you're trying to be be their friend at first. Be sure to look good and make them lauph.|`|ZX0dXmVkaa	that doesn't matter. worry about doing good in school. and of you really want to make friends..join clubs or something. do something active and positive.    also if that doesn't work out..dress more scandalous and talk ****, start fights.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be yourself.|`|TDszW6Yfaa	your 14 and if you need to ask people how to make peolpe like you then your a lost cause.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Wear what all the other girls wear, smoke and get lots and lots of boyfriends.    Just kidding, I'm 14 and you don't understand how much we don't like either three of those.     Just be yourself, look as good as possible (not too much ******** make-up).|`|y3V0R26aaa	poeple should like you for who you are   just be your self|`|7be0W5FWaa	BE YOURSELF. damn how many times have you heard that?  ps. first thing- dont ask that question here...|`|ikPC5qFyaa	Try to be nice to them and they might be nice to you or just be yourself you never know you might get friends someday.|`|De0p3aP9aa	be more outgoing perhaps.  be funny and social.  flirt more with guys, talk to them.|`|PSZEw34Kaa	YOU DONT NEED MORE FRIENDS...  you need friends that are like you...  and by that, you just have to explore more things you lik|`|hgdixjzRaa	i don't understand why you don't like your friends... if you like your friends you shouldn't need more. the popular people may have lots of friends but its better to have close friends who you can rely on, trust, and know that they care about (opposite too!)    |`|2i2NS5hlaa	You need to talk to people. I feel just like you, until I spoke up. At lunch, don't be afraid, ask to sit with a group of semi-popular. Become good friends and don't get too close though because keep moving a step higher by sitting with more popular peeps. If you want, make a list of the grades popularity, like from who is the most popularist and then down until you reach yoursel. And for boys, getting a guy isn't easy. My first boyfriend was hard, but here is a trick. Get SKINNY!! straighten your hair, and at a social, dance with a group of friends. Be FUN!! At school, talk to alot of girls and then go ahead! Get closer to the guy, guys love girls that are interactive with other girls!!! GOOD LUCK!!|`|uSQxUHQHaa	try and make friends with the popular kids or make more guy friends   they arent all that popular if you think bout it i used 2 think the same when i was 13 and was wasnt really known till i got into a fight but thats not how people like me u should be yourself and dont stoop 2 there level if they wanna make trouble cause their not worth a fight   trust me|`|HnTpvVEEaa	Being popular isnt everything. But if you really want to be popular work out get a nice body, wear makeup, wear cute name brand clothes, try out for cheerleading and other sports, act confident like you already KNOW your popular. and be outgoing and talk to alot of people! good luck=)|`|HVy3QcW2aa	Be yourself.    And just be out their and social.|`|zRit8suXaa	get a really hottt popular guy to go out wit u works like a charm also wear popular clothe abercrombie american eagle aeropastle hollister the works|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	Um just talk to them, be super outgoing. Flirt and smile, but don't be creepy. Ask for numbers, and get to know people.|`|H1vlujjtaa	its hard to be yourself **** buying abercombie and hollister ur wasting ur money.|`|6pi5aGasaa	If you want to be popular, be outgoing. And don't care about what other people think and be REALLY nice. Maybe invite some popular girls over and if they say no just say 'ok'    dont worry, your time will come|`|AA10411096	I'm not being conceited or anything, but I'd say that I'm friends with the guys and I go out with them and I'm invited to the parties.    Don't try so hard, honestly. Don't TRY to look at the "popular" people because it gets kind of annoying if you have someone following you around. I guess you could wear the trends and stuff, like leggings and Nike sneakers and ballet flats. Join a sport or something, because that's how I met a lot of my friends.     Uhhm. DO NOT just tag along. If the popular people ask YOU to hang out, they like you. If you keep asking them and they keep on being "busy," you're annoying.|`|xGZJuHSSaa	all you need to do is mingle with people from different groups. don't be shy, open up to everyone around you. just don't act fake, because that gives people the wrong impression of you. those girls have a lot of confidence, and for you to have a lot of confidence you need to be happy with yourself. change up your style a little bit, be crazy and have fun. do whatever it takes to be happy! just stay true to yourself.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Honey, most popular kids are to stuck up to allow anyone into their group unless you are loaded with money and wear all the fancy clothes. BUT, if you would still like to try, but some of the new fashions and keep talking to them. Most popular kids are really outgoing and seem to flock to out going people|`|WgucL3Wyaa	Don't be jealous.  I know you feel lonely, but you really can't make people like you, it has to come naturally to them.  Be yourself, try to make a way to draw them to you. Popular girls are not very happy either, they get hurt too and have problems.|`|wcB91DUTaa	Well you can't just BE popular.  There are different kinds of "popular"  The ones where you're pretty and everyone likes you-kind of popular  and the other one where "You're friendly and nice" popular.    I rather be the second one if you ask me; because being popular especially the first one...you won't know who your true friends are. Maybe ppl are just hanging out with you to get their personal gain.    Just be friendly with everyone. Say hi everytime you see them. Make yourself lovable, lol.  Good Luck|`|953b8d3b5ffbd99d49d2e5485e1d4d2daa	girs like that are the kind who are having sex way too young, getting bad grades, and being mean to people who aren't as popular as them or have little flaws. I would suggest you don't try to get them to like you, but instead just be more friendly, fun to be around, and fashionable. There's no way people could dislike you if you were nice and fun to be around.|`|nn7cxOruaa	I'm 14 too! I am just like you, I get sort of jealous of the "populars" sometimes. But when I think about it, i realize that they are just people who are SOOOO insecure with themselves. Stick with the friends you have, because they will actually make something out of their lives one day. They are true friends! The popular people will screw up there lives.    Just be yourself! How can anyone resist loving youu then??!!! i hope i helped! Good Luck :)) I bet you have a ton of friends but you just don't know it :))|`|EwSEito4aa	be out going  be funny talk in funny voices  be in on celeb news and other things  talk to random people  HAVE FUN|`|0LHXNXVfaa	Man u know i'm exactly how u are right now...    Same as in i do have friends but not real popular.     But u know, there's two reason why ppl are popular. One: they're really lucky, hot, and really funny smart. Two: they been through a lot of crap and they know a lot, and they take the street everyday, laught in the face of dangers. But still i don't accept everything that happening but there's really nothing u can do about something that just is except just TRY! If u TRY u will succeed one day! Just do ur best okay? :)|`|CTh1cHnMaa	just be yourself be with your group of friends.|`|KJ9TQgrYaa	ok so just ask them stuff and talk to see what you have in common and say hi every day so you know each other    hope it works
Xf9vSIixaa	I think you shouldn't be best friends with her anymore. If all she wanted was your boyfriend then that's pretty mean and apparently isn't a very good friend. Find a new one before this one uses you for more things and ends up hurting you badly.
NOKScSJqaa	not weird... more like unpolite...:)|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	HA its only weird if they think its weird and if they really are your bffs then they'll tell you if it bothers them. but if you guys think its fun then who cares if its weird! its ok to be a little weird sometimes anyway|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Not if you make them really freakn' cool!|`|PTP8ptDbaa	a little, yeah!|`|y3V0R26aaa	yes|`|BodlzZGaaa	depends how close you are to you friends me and my friends all have names for each other  one of my best friends jamie i call jamesface     if there more like nick names its ok put if there lik  Princess Sungle Wugle Bing bong   thats kinda wierd   but it also depends on the friend!!!!|`|YfTMBFIIaa	Not if it is something like Quern or Tay-tay.  It is okay for them to be your inside jokes.  Just don't have names like Muffin or Poochie.|`|IbEJEV8saa	Yes|`|wcB91DUTaa	Haha, I don't think so. Because my friends have pets name for each other.|`|3Ae9XYOUaa	um yea that is freaking weird|`|Y6ki4IdHaa	why the heck would you do that?|`|IwaaSQZcaa	Yes.    These girls at our school call each other Cat and Moose, freakiest and most made fun of girls at our school.|`|ZfqKbAB8aa	Nope|`|8FuwpE56aa	its kinda weird but if they don't mind than it doesn't matter.|`|gmodPsVFaa	a little because people usually use pet names for love

bM4zYt44aa	I don't think you should feel stupid.  If you only talked to people you knew, you would never make any friends.  You kind of have to start somewhere when trying to meet people.  Just tell them that no you don't know them, but you're just trying to make some friends in the area, or that you go to an all girls school and you want some guy friends.  It's simple, if they still think it's weird then they probably enjoy being in an all guys school a little too much.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, it seems that you are trying to stalk them.
bM4zYt44aa	Best thing you can do is be honest.  Guys hate nothing more than a girl that plays mind games.  Just simply tell him that you don't share those feelings, that your friendship is as far as you want to go and it's not his fault, it's just that you've gotten so close in that way that it would just be weird or not worth the risk to try things Intimately|`|ORluWHGAaa	Tell him you just want to be friends  "IF" you guys ever ever break up..I am not sure if things will still be the same.
bf5cDEyZaa	Get a little basket and fill it with things he likes... cookies, candy, fruit, magazines, a book, puzzle toy, crossword puzzle booklet or anything that he might enjoy eating, reading, drinking, looking at, playing with.

We aren't a straight out easy to understand bunch, so tread with care.    A girl might show her affections for you in many different ways, but please never confuse the 'playing hard to get' with the 'just not interested' girl.      A playing hard to get girl is 'coy and flirty' Where as the one thats so often confused with it, is not at all playful and is instead vexed. Believe me I've been there, I've been annoyed by a man who wouldn't listen.    So theres not really much of a way to tell if a woman likes you, unless you know this woman and how she shows affection.  Good luck, maybe I'll get on and explain more thoroughly later, but for now I have to jet.|`|AA12236898	It's usually pretty obvious.  She smiles when she sees you.  She finds a way to touch you.  She'll joke around with you.|`|AA12164569	Does she lean closer when you talk to her, or face your direction? Does she casually touch you when she talks to you? Those are some pretty good signs. Also, do you feel like the girl actually enjoys spending time with you? and, does she flirt with you while you spend time together? Just ask yourself some of these questionons, she might like you.|`|AA12308445	umm..i think youll know|`|a9f4399550d831232785b17c316e5970aa	well...they are flirty and if you hang with other girls they tend to get a lil bit jelous and if they always dress nice and try every thing to try and to impress you
AA11516041	Hello Bella, the first year of our marriage we made love about 6 days out of each week. Once our Daughter was born it dropped off quite a bit. Now after 11 years of marriage we still make love 2-3 times per week on average. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It doesn't matter how many times you do it. As long as you BOTH are happy, in love and please each other, everything will be wonderful!  Good luck|`|AA10127478	It depends on the temperament of the couple. Generally during the initial days, both try to discover the secrets of each other and  therefore have sex more than once daily.  For the first six months, the couples don't tire.  But after that the frequency diminishes and comes to at least once per day.  After child birth, the frequency becomes lesser and lesser.   However, the husband tries to keep the desire and frequency alive.|`|68099000afb66cf59ea1b88e9c022204aa	Newlyweds?  Depends on how long we're talking.

The better the sex the more you want it.  The problem I read is someone is not wanting to have physical love so frequently.  Men need to understand that women have hot and cold perods where they really need it and a time where they just need to be cuddled and held!  Communicate!!!!!|`|AA10631372	what is too much sex? i have been married for 10yrs and i still want sex every day. my wife thinks that 2 twice a month is fine. just find a happy medium and it will be fine.|`|AA10378559	First, I don't believe there is a "normal" to having sex so long as it doesn't interfere with your health or the rest of you life as to frequency. Now, I'll answer your question.    I've been married three times, at three distinct ages of my life; once in mid-twenties, one time in my late 30s and this last time in my mid-forties. So naturally the frequency would vary.    First marriage, in the first months, at first once a day, then 2 to 3 times a week. Sometimes more when we could fit an afternoon hour in my workday.    Second marriage, initially 2 to 3 times a day, which was usual through the summer, since we both were teachers and on vacation from work. Then it was constant pretty much at 3 times a week for the duration of our marriage of seven years, until the last months when it became barely once a week.    Third marriage, maybe once a day for the first week, then 2 times a week for the balance  the first months. My wife and I are a bit mix-matched in our sexual drives.    So, you see, for one individual, there is no norm. Neither is there for anyone else. It's a highly individualistic thing with many variables, regardless what the popular magazines like to say about averages. Hope I haven't given you more information here than you wanted.|`|AA11846967	For us it was everyday for the first year and a half, and sometimes more than once a day. Excluding that "one" week of the month of course...  Now its like like 4 times a week. We've been married 4yrs now|`|AA11564496	well, for the first 2-3 months in our marriage, yes we have sex about 5-6 times a week then after that we have sex about 3 times a week and now we are just married for 2 years believe me we just have sex 1-2 times a week. I need more than that. maybe 3-4 times a week is the best for me, i am 27 and my husband is 43, we only have most of the time nowadays with our marriage, we only have sex once a week. so, the rest of those days left in a week without having sex with him, i just play myself. i just understand that he can't give me as much as i want because he might be so tired from work. anyway, i really do hoping everything will always be ok to that. i really love him and i don't want to cheat with him. he is just too nice and too good husband for me to cheat with.

If you have a name, or a birth date you could try a people search. with search.com or other search directories. You could also register on the adoption registry for Puerto Rico.  I hope this helps, but I also want to say as a person who has been reunited, reunion doesn't always fill the void or heal all the emptiness....Sorry I can't tell you it does... So maybe becoming part of an adoption reunion message group might help you deal with the possibilities of finding him or not and all the emotions you are feeling!!

AA10047854	Every faith hopes that its members marry someone who is also of the same faith, in Christianity it is called 'equally yoked' from     2 Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not unequally   yoked together with unbelievers: for what   fellowship hath righteousness with   unrighteousness? and what communion hath   light with darkness?     There are a few reasons for this. First, marriages have enough problems staying together, that when you add the differences that come from different faiths, it makes the marriage a lot less stable, more likely to divorce, which is indeed the stats on this. Take religious holidays, that are supposed to bring families together. Issues come up at the Christmas/Chanukah season, like, Whose parents will we spend the holidays at? How much of one faith, or the other, will we have in our home? How can i raise my children in one faith, when the other faith states that they will be damned by Gd to eternal torture for not being a believer?     Second, since every faith values its distinctiveness, wants to maintain those values and beliefs which are distinct to it, the best way to pass those values and distinctiveness to the next generation is to marry within the faith. According to most studies, in the U.S., when a Jew marries someone who is not Jewish, the kids are raised as Jews in only a fourth of the marriages, regardless of whether or not they told the rabbi who married them that they would raise their kids as Jews.    But please note that this has nothing to do with race or nation, but has everything to do with having the same values and beliefs, the two most important factors for having a solid marriage!|`|AA10238008	Of course they can marry non-religious! My best friend who happens to be Jewish is marrying a Catholic woman in September. Also, look up Cokie Roberts. She's Catholic and her husband is Jewish.    I'm sure belief-wise it's easier to marry in your religion, as I'm sure it is for any religion, but it doesn't mean you're restricted to it. Love doesn't see religion, the same way it doesn't see color or weight.|`|614814ed4444f169e003edd5ee70ea15aa	no and yes|`|9327b1a1807416f8f2e832e4ca6b6c54aa	Joey B is correct.  However,  the past couple of generations of Jews are getting less and less religious, and conservative and orthadox Jews tend to try to coax their family members into marrying other Jews, because the Jewish population is so small.|`|AA12170300	By Torah law it is against the Jewish practice to marry outside the faith -  a Jewish person can marry  a non practicing Jew  but not a non Jew, unless the person goes through a kosher conversion    Joey is wrong    If you are a non religious Jew than for him it makes no difference - but in the letter of the law it is not acceptable.        A non practicing Jew is always considered a Jew no matter what    That is how the Jews survived after so much persecution - when the big wave of Russians emigrated to Israel most of them were non religious Jews - but if there mother was Jewish then they were still considered Jews and would be able to marry other Jews|`|b28bf87b3da0f5b05486eb890e303642aa	i dont think so.The Jew aren't allowed to marry other people but Jews.This also includes the non-religious and if you ask me these are the most detested, more than any other type of religious|`|dab4532a6289d0529c8a83dcdb058695aa	Traditional Judaism does not permit interfaith marriages. The Torah states that the children of such marriages would be lost to Judaism (Deut. 7:3-4), and experience has shown the truth of this passage all too well. The 2000 National Jewish Population Survey found that only a third of interfaith couples raise their children Jewish, despite increasing efforts in the Reform and Conservative communities to welcome interfaith couples

I have many times have felt the same exact way you do, and i accually tried to hurt myself and used to cut myself when I was younger. The first thing you need to do is go to someone you trust and is impartial to your situation and get some help, these feelings will not go away by themself it will just get worse. believe me life can be great with some ups and downs.please get help i do not want anything to happen to you!!! you are somebody and you count. when people feel the way you do they tend to push people away without even knowing it, maybe explain to your friend whats going on and maybe it will make you even closer. you also tell your mom if you guys are close if not tell a couselor at school but tell someone, its hard to talk about things at first but they way you feel after is so rewarding|`|hci2me2kaa	Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.There will always be someone better looking-always.

Everyone has there own way of expressing things, and everyone interprets things differently! Life has ups and downs, and its best to share these hills with a friend, because they make life worth the ride! Everything will be ok! Just focus less on entertaining your friends, and more on your school works, once you have gotten your grades back, you can put a little more attention into friends, and you can patch everything up with them! But most importantly know that God loves you, and he is trying to give you a hint that you aren't going on the correct path right now, and he is trying to change your path so it leads to the right one! You have tons of people that love you, and sometimes its hard to see, but when you fall, its the ones that catch you that you should hold onto!      Tell you mom what your feeling, and tell her that you want someone to help you through this, i swear that moms are the best at dealing with these things! they know everything, and they can give you the best advice!      Hold your head high, and remember that God loves you no matter what, and that he wont ever let you fall, he will always be there to catch you!

bf6K6uubaa	if they chose you then accept it and be honored...they want to give you the biggest part possible that they can cause they love u and best man would be the biggest part besides theirs of course.|`|AA11737190	I think it is entirely appropriate. Of course, my best man was a woman, so what do I know?|`|IplmS6ACaa	There is nothing wrong whatsoever, you should be very proud of yourself that your parents want you to be their Best Man.    You have no reason to feel awkward, just give a short heartfelt speech and enjoy their special day.|`|76nTvO4iaa	They asked you to be best man because you are the person they love most in the world.    Fathers stand up for their sons all the time.  I see no reason why a son shouldn't stand up for his father, especially when he's marrying the son's mother!|`|8926df5af8e7cec717561d7fcd237c90aa	I don't understand why you would feel awkward about it. Your parents wants to share this moment with you. Even if your father does have close friends, I'm sure he loves you the most out of all of those men, esp. since you're the only son, and wants YOU to be his best man. It's completely normal. Take the job and be honored. =)    My friend is about to marry a man who have children from his previous marriage. His son is his best man. I think its sweet.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	There are no rules regarding who the best man has to be. They can choose whoever they hold most dear. It doesn't even have to be a man. Be flattered that they want to share their special day with you and enjoy yourself!|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	your their son, this is a honor and i think t would really hurt your parents if you said no. they are probably looking forward to this, hope i could help,   -Joe|`|LbvRxf2jaa	Why do you feel awkward?  They chose you as the closest and most trustworthy person they know...you should be honoured!    Also, they are your parents....and it's their choice really for their wedding...|`|WtzKQVGXaa	That is a great honor that your dad has asked you to be his bestman he feels it will make the day more special since you can be by his side.|`|t7jiSmjVaa	You are the male your father feels closest to. You should feel honored and except it with pride. When my cousin got married he had 3 brothers and dozens of cousin but he choose my father to be his best man. His own father had died and he felt really close to my dad who sort of took the place of his father.

di6p10Ifaa	Wow if there are rules to this stuff then people would never be getting married. That is rediculous to have rules. He should buy what he wants to and can afford. My grandfather purposed to my grandmother with a ring made from an old corncob during the great depression. Did you know she kept it her entire life? He carved it would of the corn cob because he had no money to spend on a ring yet he wanted her hand in marriage. Do you think she cared? lol nope. Even after he got her a gorgeous diamond bridal set after the depression was over she still kept the ring and highly treasured it. So it is just the thought that counts...tell your friend that. When you are in love even an old ring made of a corn cob will make you happy especially in hard times.|`|Lwved4teaa	theres not necessarily a "rule" but what youre thinking of is 3 MONTHS.  i think even that is high.  dont go in to debt for a ring... youll never have the money for the actual wedding!|`|m13CCGc1aa	Seems a bit excessive.  Use the 30,000 for a down payment on a house.  Even if that was 1/3 of my husband's yearly salary, I wouldn't want him to spend that much on a ring.    A wedding ring, engagement ring should be nice as it is something that bride will wear (hopefully) for the rest of her life.  I think we need to put a stop to craziness though.    That said, I have heard that it is 3 months salary....|`|uTdEdpAeaa	you can do whatever and spend however you want but rule of thumb it's 3 months salary... some people here wrote 2 months and that incorrect. no rules are made to be broken so you spend your money however and how much you wanna spend... it's not based on the yearly income it's based on the month salary.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	wow- a $30,000 ring?? That would be quite a ring.     I think the guy needs to spend what he can comfortably afford without going into debt or financing.  It is ridiculous to spend a bunch of money you don't have on a ring and go into debt. So if a man is comfortable in spending $30,000 or $300 it should be stress free.    I have heard the guideline of 3 months salary is what should be spent, but honestly, how many guys can really afford that? especially the young couples who are usually graduating college and starting a career? The only guideline is that it should be bought with love , as a token of affection for the girl. Plenty of girls have pretty rings and miserable relationships.     My fiance paid for my ring outright with no financing . He spoiled me with a beautiful ring and I love it.  I know he chose a special ring form his heart that he could comfortably afford with out stressing himself financially.|`|nujen4dmaa	I personally don't think there should be any rules.  Spend what you reasonably afford.    IdealD|`|DET61tGPaa	That is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life, The price of the rign really shouldn't matter at all, if you love the guy and he loves you, if he buys you a 1000 or even less dollar ring it shouldn't matter, sounds liek your friend is a gold digger to me|`|gQYtRcrbaa	i thought it was three months salary, not a third of the yearly take home....and is that pre or post taxes...what a crock..it could be tin foil what does it matter except for love|`|ohi0kM6Raa	Whoa, whoa, whoa!....whoa! a third? religions, RELIGIONS, ask for 10%.  a third?!?  damn, dude.  i can't get over that.  goddamn a third!  no that's outrageous.|`|AA11737190	Nine out of ten jewelers would disagree with you.     Of course it is ridiculous. It is impossible to put a monetary value on love.     I tried to pick out an engagement ring and became overwhelmed. My girl picked out her ring. It cost me $400.|`|1kZenfZzaa	Best to spend what you can afford to buy.  The words "supposed to", really bug me.|`|VXBulo3Yaa	It is supposed to be three months salary according to some stupid tradition.  If that were the case I would have  a FATTY ring...and I do not.  I think it should simply be a combonation of what he can afford and what she likes, plain and simple.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	Well, the traditional rule of thumb is 3 months salary - I can't imagine wearing a ring that costs a quarter of his salary on my finger.  I would be terrified that I would lose it or something.  Plus, we could be doing so much more with that money - Like paying off a mortgage.    So, yes, it's 'traditional', but I doubt you'd find many people who still follow this rule or think it's a good idea.|`|DqetlSB6aa	shes full of sh*t thats ridiculous unless you want to wear a down payment on a house on your finger. 1/2 to a carat will give you a beautiful ring.  he can spend 700-2000.  ive seen a carat for like 1200-1500|`|TNH8QMOaaa	There is no such pre-defined rule or a norm. Its your own personal choice about how much to spend on an engagement ring. After all, engagement ring symbolizes eternal love and trust and it cannot be compared with money for sure.

I dont think the ring should be the center of attention. It should be the man giving it and the up coming marriage.|`|5PVFXry8aa	umm... i heard it supposed to be 3 paychecks!|`|A8F4HF3Paa	That's ridiculous.

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	My ex was almost immediately with his new girlfriend (now wife) when we split so I didn't worry about that because I knew she would handle it.  If not for her, I would have absolutely made sure that she had a gift for her dad.  Tell your husband it's not ABOUT your ex! It's about the fact that your son will be excited to have a gift for Dad. You wouldn't want him to be embarrassed or hurt for not having a gift, would you? Also, it sends a clear message to your son that it's OK for him to love his dad and that you're OK with that!  It's the best thing for his self esteem!|`|3b30836253e0d10626723c6e7fbb6890aa	Does your ex take your son shopping to buy YOU a gift? Probably not. Though I think your heart is in the right place, I'm not sure your head is. I'm not intending to insult you, I'm meaning that divorce is hard on everyone, and sometimes our heads get foggy and we have lapses in judgement. I recommend having your son make Dad's holiday gift and here is why. First of all, it will teach your son that gift giving comes from the heart and that is a lesson that will last a lifetime. Also, you as a mom knows that a handmade gift from your childs heart is the best gift of all, Dad knows that too!|`|AA11564224	i have my daughter make a card for her dad and then i ask her what she would like to get him as a present.  last year she said water balloons, so that's what we got him, and he loved it.  :)|`|AA12382198	You son should give his dad a Christmas present.....set a budget and take him shopping.

34f917678352c312dd367a45cec8a80baa	I don't really know how this applies to your situation, but my rule of thumb is that if someone seems like they aren't really interested, it's because they aren't. There could be any number of reasons...don't beat yourself up over it. .. it's not good or bad, it just is. Girls do this too. You probably will or have done it. I'm not saying you shouldn't feel angry or confused; that's human nature as well. But I do think it's better to think "it was fun while it lasted" and move on. Find things to do, hang out with your friends, stay busy, and you'll meet someone else. That's how I deal when that sort of thing happens.|`|AA11149006	If you slept with him I guess he got what he wanted.|`|AA10583453	Don't call him.  You don't want to be friends with benefits do you.

That or he is dying and just does not have the strength to pick up a phone.|`|8b59b1f080af16042c1e623f251117cdaa	I'm VERY sorry to say this, but there are 2 negative probabilities. It's possible that he used you because he just wanted sex, not a relationship. Or, there may be another woman. It may not be either of these things, but often it is. I really hope it's not, but you should prepare yourself for a breakup.
642b31354742e7fa33dcb587b70e5c1daa	sounds like you are growing up, but more importantly remember to be yourself.... most likely he likes you because you aren't too "girly" and play soccer, flag football, and are FUN!  keep it light and natural, and see where it goes!|`|39377f8fe540ede9db7e56a06d0a8e63aa	All that you have to do is look into his eyes and smile.  And a more obvious approach would be touch his arm or something when you talk to him...while looking him in the eyes and smiling.  That's all it takes!
ecbcc63a4d2ff454401051a7966e05ffaa	If you trust her, maybe you should sit down and ask her. So many rumors about girls are crap. Another thing to consider is unless we are talking about a ridiculous number of guys, this is something that you might just want to let go. In this day and age, most of us have been around the block. While I'm sure you don't want to be with a total ho, you might want to forgive a couple of lovers before you... if she's worth keeping.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	So what, what is in the past is in the past. Is she cheating on you? Are you happy in the relationship? They may just be jealous of your relationship. Tell them to mind their own business.

Don't accuse her, don't be confrontational...just ask straight out....tell her that you BOTH need to be honest with each other. Good luck.|`|f976295403f20aaaebc046617ef4ae52aa	do you believe everything you hear?...and if it was before..like before you went out ..then who cares..otherwise..ask your gf...tell her that ppl are saying these things...most likely these dudes are jelious..but it mite be true so i dunno..i would ask your gf|`|7be4d4699be00352119f0061264512c3aa	well open your eyes.   if she is real flirty with people, then she might be a slut.        ask yourself what kind of person do you deserve ,  and then observe wether she is that kind of person or not.

Just TRY IT!     GOOD LUCK!!|`|f59d10fef1638f15c4bf42cb7e7233eaaa	Confidence, Confidence, Confidence!  Nothing attracts a woman more. Be brave and approach the group, possibly with a 'wingman'.  Cheesy and predictable yes, but it might help you get back into the swing of things.  Unapproachable look?ng people normally are just shy (and if they are mean, you don't want to hang out with/date them anyway.) Getting back into the dating scene is hard to be sure, and not without some bumps.  But don't worry so much, the worst thing they could say is 'no'.

A lot of black men tend to be lazy and laid back "I am not saying all because I am definetely not laid back" and while at the house the black women sees this and starts to become upset and cusses his *** out like he deserves.  thats why when you see black television shows the women is usually the dominant figure in the house. if you dont believe me look for it. we got some status issues going on in the house and when the women starts trying to act superior the man bales.|`|74024b516bc501f5c81b319929610205aa	i think that they go to other races because of the attitudes of the ladies is completely different  and when ignorant Spanish and white women makes comments about us i want to beat the **** out of them

You are not behaving rudely to your dying parent.  His drinking is not about you, and you are not responsible for his behavior toward others.  If anyone tells you you are responsible, or acts as though you are, politely tell them that your mate is a grown man, and he has made the choice to behave in this way... Please take all complaints to the offender not yourself.  You probably have enough issues dealing with the interaction in your own household.    Drinking in itself is not a problem, just like bowling in itself is not a problem.  If bowling obsessions cause other problems, like rudeness, violence, lost work... these are problems.  Don't bother addressing the drinking, because only he can decide to quit, and if he does decide to quit or reduce his drinking, it will not be because you think it is worthwhile, it will be because *he* thinks it is worthwhile.    Stick to issues that are addressable, and which relate only to yourselves.  Want him to get to work everyday?  Be polite to you?  Come to dinner most nights?  Do you  have a reasonable basis to ask these things of him?  The rest of the world will be reminding him of the rest of the trouble he causes if you don't bother to listen to people complaint to *you*.  If your interpersonal issues are not bothersome enough for you to leave, fabulous!  You can now be content with him as he is.  If they are significant enough for you to leave, do so.      Do not bother to bargain about drinking habits, because promises are just promises.  Leave and wait for solid performance to see if you care to tolerate his company.    Get off the roller coaster, one way or the other.  This problem may affect your life, but it is not your problem.

Do something that will give you a break and benefit you and them at the same time.  Theres nothing wrong with being a stay at home mom but remember, this isnt the 50's now.  It's not a sin for women to want to make something of themselves!  And you should, to set a good example for your daughters.  They're always looking up to you and watching what you do!   If school is not an option at the moment, work towards making it one.  Find a trustworthy babysitter if you are not married, start looking into different schools etc. In the meantime, if you are running out of things to do, maybe you could enroll your oldest daughter in some swimming or gymnastics classes.|`|875951a141c1b719d3a797d0be39f7b8aa	well have them take a class or someting for you to relax a little or take some sort of art class with them just do activities together go shopping draw a picture go to a musuem if its warm enough to go outside take a walk or adopt a family pet and play with it|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	Take them to the mall and just look around while they are people watching!

3946b286a2bae7f8b38bb28f7c41bf36aa	NO, that is emotional abuse.  Never let anyone control you.  It sounds like a bad situation.  You need to consider leaving because that is not love.  Love makes you feel good.  Sometimes relationships may have difficult times but they get worked out.  A good relationship is not about control, it is about support and love.  Take care of yourself.|`|3e9e90ffce25302d8ccb4e238f56ecd5aa	no. no guy should stop you from doing something that you want to do. he if feeling insecure and doesnt know what you two are talking about. if he really loved you then he would allow you to talk with your best friend!... so no, he doesnt have the right to stop you from talking to your friends.|`|8d9d7cc2b7898928f300f6af361fbdd2aa	He has no right to tell you how to live your life, You have free will and such exercise it.|`|47ab0458e38d5d8578fd7ab71cbae40faa	No, he doesn't have.|`|4e49432d4c9f8800fbf2cb447ab2c3ebaa	Noone has the right to keep you from seeing or speaking with anyone.

cfcdbf4b22c8e70ca7ca81bdf0bb1888aa	Ok. Heres a quick compilation. I made this mainly to help guys, but i guess it can work both ways ;).     1. Play with your hair. This shows thats your nervous or anxious around him.     2. Distance and location is key. Try to be close to him. If he's sitting at a table, sit opposite him or sit on his side of the table next to him. While standing attempt to be close to him at all times. This doesn't mean on top of him. Just try to make yourself a part of his everyday view, so know he knows you exist ;)    3. Laugh and giggle at his crappy jokes and try to get some eye contact with him while doing so. Smile and look away, you know ;)    4. Physical contact is major in flirting with him. Tap him on the arm or on the leg. Playfully push him. Only use physical contact flirting when you believe that your Good friends with him, otherwise keep physical contact to a minimum.    5. Immitate some of his body language, his posture. Don't over do it, or thats just being a copy cat ;)    6. Its all about the eyes. Look at him in the eye and bite your lip. He might look back, and stare, but its a good stare. You can also look at him and then wait until he looks. When he does, look away and smile.    7. Smile when you see him and wave a shy "hello" or "hi".    8. Your choice of clothing and style is more "open" and "nice". Your single and open, so don't cross your legs or fold your arms.    9. Compliment him on just about anything even though it might not be something that deserves a compliment. Examples, don't compliment his huge zit on his forehead and tell him its unoticable. Try to compliment his shoes, hair, shirt, or pants.    But the most important rule, is to be yourself.

b2e1093214b21f02988b29dd891e8bd3aa	No one likes to be taken advantage of, and it sounds as if your friend is doing exactly that to you.  If you can't come right out and say "no"..then when she asks, tell her you have plans, and are unable to do it.  If she asks what plans, tell her you are taking your child somewhere, or spending some time alone with your child.  Maybe she will get the hint that she should do the same.|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	i go my way and don,t care others|`|9e987b7f017f087d2ce675d7c0870618aa	I learned a new word this year, after having many people walk all over me and use me i realized i have the power and the right to put myself first.

You probably saved her child from being on its own for several hours!  The only reason you were "the last one on her list" is because she can no longer con someone else into taking care of her child while she goes on her trists!    I was in a situation where I was asked to care for someone's child "for a few hours" as well--they didn't just leave for seven hours but for two weeks!  I spend money and time searching for this person only to find that she went on a cruise!  Neither I nor the child protective agency were amused!|`|AA10280192	I'd say that next time, ask what the emergency is before you say yes.  If she says it's for a night on the town or to go out and have drinks, tell her no, that you already have a date with someone who is handsome and charming and witty, and probably has his shoes untied (obviously your son) :)|`|a5e5093421907c4932f675dddaedd001aa	just call her up and say that you can't...it's so simple!|`|uaVh3ms5aa	I just wouldn't do her any more favors like that again, you have the right to say no to her.

However I wouldn't like end a friendship over it or anything like that.|`|c6fdccdeec060740c30d91b5ca5aeb96aa	the one being bitchy and not a good friend is her. your child should come first and since you said you did not have a lot of time to spend with him tell her you are going to spend some emergency time with  your child|`|de3ded3d47b8cd86a3a4fd49449fae67aa	I had an in-home daycare and this would frequently happen to me on friday nights.  These emergencies would end with the parent sometimes showing up at all hours after having several drinks.  What I would do is one of two things...since you don't get out that much then I would insist that a fair trade be decided upon BEFORE the "emergency favor" takes place.  Something reasonable and fair.  If you don't trust this person to watch your child then I would tell her what you charge.  Tell her that you are dying to buy a certain something for your child and you are saving up the money to do so.  If you can't get paid because she spends all her money that night then I would never do a favor again.  Tell her exactly how you feel in the nicest way.  I never minded doing things for others as long as it was paid forward.  If you can't get paid forward then make mental notes never to do a favor again.

2f4e2415c630a4994beebec821b5542eaa	here lies one of the resons i have few female friends...females can be self serving, vain, fickle and pretentious all at once and are considerably harder work than men...    women are often like this for a number of reasons...one is that they are so insecure themselves that it makes them feel good to see other peoples problems...and then takes away the feeling of guilt for not wishing them well in general when they can 'help'...    another common one is the females that have a life and problems they either cannot or will not face and deal with...the ones that pretend that everything is wonderful...when really its not...by keeping others down they can make their problems feel insignificant...and by 'helping ' it stops them dealing with their own...as they dont have to think about it when they are so involved in other peoples business...    there are of course some good genuine friends here...but they are hard to find...especially amongst the female of the species...|`|01f0a86db701a4ad51b81f50889c82d7aa	yes i do..infact i have two... yes i get intimidated when they throw bad remarks at me. but hey take it as an encouragement to do better next time..i have a friend who'll never admit that i have a pretty good figure( not boasting) i have other friends who praise me for that but this particular friend somehow finds the way to pull my self confidence down but...in the end in your heart you do know what is right and wrong..these people just makes me a stronger person. normally friends who do this stuff are very envious of us and just cant or do not want to accept the fact that we're sometimes better than them.. so they intimidate you to make themself feel good bout themselves.|`|192c341cc9aa8d5fb3489ec5a1cf109aaa	I only bother with people I click with.|`|1c291a17220c477f89804912581cdd3daa	I have such a friend, yes.    She can never be happy for me. She says something nice, but she doesn't mean it.    And in general, all she always likes to talk about is how bad this or that person is, what problems she has, how her knee/throat/stomach/head... hurts etc.    The most interesting thing about her is that in general she also prefers to hear bad news.|`|10cdf10f848ef9d1de57ac51286432d6aa	I had one of these a few years ago..didnt realise it at the time, but once i did she was history.    i was going through a tough divorce etc and was quite literally suicidal at the time, she was the best friend in the world, very supportive, always on my doorstep etc    when i was better she suddenly became a right cow, accusing me of sleeping with her boyfriend, trying to make me jealous and insecure over my ex, she was a nightmare, she obviously had some big problems, so i just stopped talking to her and moved house without giving her a forwarding address or number, sounds abit childish, but she was a neighbour as well so there was no other way.    my advise to others in this situation is ditch them fast, lifes to short and you deserve to spend it with nice people|`|2LYTXIP9aa	yes i had a friend like that, but i got that fed up with her, i told her to p"%$ off, and we haven't spoken since, and will never again.  i feel so great, now i get on with life, without her smirky remarks and complete jealousy of me. x|`|5040e44aa52e549385dd8004c945a219aa	yeah, i don't understand the question..?|`|f0fed95574bae989cbbc1e69afaf8d26aa	usually they are not happy and do not want anyone to be happy because they feel like those people are throwing and bragging about their happiness...they comfort you which only makes you feel worse... it is a case of misery needs company|`|AA11111006	Yes I think I have one of those.   I'm not sure why I keep her around...i guess maybe cuz she tells me the way it is,straight up.   She never misses an opportunity to tell me how she really feels, it makes her feel superior and I get that part of it.   Most people don't tell you how it really is, they usually just try to be so upbeat about things all the time and leave me wondering if that is the truth.   I get sick of her too at times, in fact just yesterday. I feel she takes digs at me though very subtle. I don't let her get to me, cuz deep down inside i know her motives. To keep me down so she looks superior. But on the other hand she does have insight about things that others dont, since my other friends are always just trying to be too nice.|`|8c61ad6d98a0059cb2f44b9ef3280923aa	its nature and u find them every where|`|d65fa3eb84b0ad37fa64d42705ac2263aa	I have one, I've known her for awhile.

I had a friend who was single for the longest time and a guy at the store gave me his number and asked me out on a date and she was so upset and she was like my friend just got asked out right in front of me and she couldn't be happy for me, even though I had just waited for my boyfriend for 6 months to get back from boot camp and he cheated on me! She was still mad at me. Well, a few weeks later I hooked her up with a coworker of mine and now all she does it flaunt it and rub it in my face after I was just totally crushed by my last boyfriend!

b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	Why wait till Valentine's day? How about TOMMORROW?    Do you know where she lives? That can be helpful.     DO THIS:  ON MONDAY Slip her a note saying...you're gonna be surprised! When she reads the note and looks at you... just smile  ON TUESDAY Slip her a note saying....boy are you gonna be surprised!....same thing but smile bigger    ON WEDNESDAY Go to her house with some flowers, knock on the door and say SURPRISE!    If you're worried about getting outdone, bring the flowers on Tuesday....just say you couldn't wait to give them to her. Don't forget SURPRISE! Then ask her if she'd like to go out sometime    You do this and she'll eat it up. Girls like when courtship is fun, and besides, it'll give her a great story to tell her friends. After they hear that, they'll tell her to "hold onto that nice guy" Plus you going out of your way to plan something for her....and acting a little silly is just plain cool. You have to stick your neck out A LITTLE bit.    I did it....it worked....good luck!|`|150e258e3b70ea941371b0767d1a16b7aa	i know how you feel. i would be the girl in this problem. First of all a letter would be really cool. i would be totally flatered. and second if you are worried about someone else asking her out, you should ask first. if you dont and she says yes either she is settling or she isnt that into you.|`|640b25e644cb8bf3ddb59e3564835b42aa	I suggest talking to her more on monday and tuesday, exchange numbers, etc. Then on Wednesday bring her a rose or a little teddy bear, or whatever you feel is necessary because if you do not want to lose her, then do something sweet for her. You might end up going out with her. And even if another guy does something for her, still get her like a carnation or something because if it is going to be a great as it sounds, she'll pass on the other guy and take you. good luck with all!!!|`|OlSSIAn0aa	wow this sounds like me right now. im trying to figure out what to do myself. ive only known him for a little while and we talk on the phone once and we have so many inside jokes. but i think you should do the same as me. you should talk to her like i am going to talk to him. if youre not her style well then what can you do? i mean even if you do like her and she doesnt like you, you can still ask her to be your valentine. its only a day. things might move from there.|`|M9zXR1Mcaa	Throw her a nice smile and a simple Happy Valentine's Day, what do you have planned?  At that point she can tell you what she has planned or that she has nothing planned.  In that case you can then say "me either"  would you like to hang out? Giving her a whole letter will be creepy.  There is no harm is natural/rehearsed charm.  Good Luck!|`|e68d361eee76a2e57897a805d9dc602faa	Ha Ha Ha. Sorry to laugh but I find this funny.  If you get her something for V Day - yes that is very creepy. Don't do it.  What I suggest is simply talking to her more first and get to know her a bit. Then your chances will be better

Importantly, she can be beautiful on the outside but pretty ugly on the inside. If it doesnt work out after all, stop fighting to get your way.  It is better to still have her as a friend than having an enemy. The Lord has different plans for you. Keep it real. There are other fishes in the sea.|`|de3ded3d47b8cd86a3a4fd49449fae67aa	There has to be more for her to bite.  Thats what she was telling you.  Shes not just going out with you because you think shes pretty.  Shes bore with that.  Find out something simple about her and do something with it.  What she likes to do...what she likes to eat...etc.  You have to take the ball and run with it.  Make yourself interesting and interested in her personality more than anything else.  I hear that all the time about how pretty I am.  I didn't "grow" into my looks until I was around 25 and to be honest....it was annoying how stupid men acted when they only saw me on the outside.  good luck|`|ZCacLlRoaa	I think you should keep talking to her to ease your own mind.

No comment  With that said, your choice is to be miserable for the rest of yourself worrying about two people who have other agendas or ignore them and move on-believe me if they have any human part of compassion as obviously you do, it will bother them more if you ignore them and do not give them reason to be mad at you without real cause.|`|AA12042096	It should have been split 3 ways. i personally would forgive but forget you can't force them to pay up|`|001982b8f5657b6b8924e526ae802f4faa	i will commit suicide|`|de3ded3d47b8cd86a3a4fd49449fae67aa	well my feelings on that are this...all of that is unnecessary....you're dead.  if its paid for then let it be.  just remember next time when they ask you for money or there is a family obligation.....forgive but don't forget.

It all depends on you.  Do you still want to talk to her or not?  If your 2 friends don't want for you to talk to her why is that?  In the end, it's all up to you.  You are your own person, and you are the only one who knows what you want.  Don't let your friends tell you what to do, if they think you did bad by being friends again with the other girl then that is their opinion.  It's probably just a bit of jealousy.  Anyway, just talk to that girl and see what happens.  Besides, it takes time to become what you were back then, you can't just expect her to talk to you again, and be all the same.  Take your time and see if you get close again.|`|wumbMTRmaa	I don't know about that, but I think you're a retard for your obvious lack of sufficient thought power to type coherent sentences.

If he really liked you he would make time to see you and talk to you. However he seems very reluctant to get close to you perhaps he is afraid to move forward. He is either confused or playing with your head.  2)Here is a sign of attachment. If he keeps something you gave him regardless of the message you seemed to be sending Solly because it came from you and depicted the two of you together, I can only guess that he does have some sort of attachment to you.  3)OK here we seem to be contradicting the first paragraph where he doesn't know what to do or say since he seems to be moving forward with his feelings.  Seems you've found yourself an interesting man here. If the three items were presented in the order that you listed them then he seems to have moved past some emotional barrier and is ready to move forward with a relationship. If not then the prognosis is different. If maybe the bear came first(but he never gave it to you) and then you  gave him the picture he could have become confussed and found it necesary to put his feelings into words at which point your actions have become the barrier that holds him back. My bets on he digs you|`|62fcdc094994e1a2db936084002b1bb8aa	The guy's hurtin' yo! He needs you!|`|AA11307474	i believe that he does have some feelings for you but maybe he just doesn't want to spill it out at once!    he mentions "friends" and "I love you"; that's an rare combination?    i can recomend to have a sit down: talk together, ASK him about his feelings, does he see you as just a "friend" or are those words sending a sublime message that he disgised?    any way best of luck    Kester|`|330c897505d5935eeb2fdc9bebdad933aa	it smells so|`|22de6b27d6f54442919345f86f7c4f0baa	of course he likes you! he even said it in the letter!|`|nn6OtQ09aa	A boy/man means what he says...so try not to read too much into this.    He said he really likes you, as friends. That he wants you in his life. That he never wants to hurt you. That he feels there isn't enough time to be together. That he loves you.    That is exactly what he means.    He is also saying...if you can't handle that, then he would rather you not talk to him, because it hurts his feelings to hurt you if you want more.    We can not change the way people feel sweetie. He is offering his love and friendship to you. And you...either care about him enough to be his friend because you genuinely like him...or you must let him go completely if you can't accept that he is not in the space of having a girlfriend right now.    He sounds like a sweetiepie and thinks the world of you...in order to have responded in this way. Doesn't that feel good? Just do yourself a favor and try not to spend too much time obsessing over it. You have a wonderful friend, if you want him in your life. This is a blessing darlin!     Take care.|`|fjQBfvq8aa	Follow ur heart ur the only one that can figure this out u could ask him then become really great friends with his mom to!  Good Luck!
qIMmfIqMaa	I recomend not giving him a letter most guy's don't like to read anyways. Just start out with a hi and a smile and see how he responds.  Maybe he's start a conversation. If not ask him how it's goin. By now you should know if he's interested at all. If not give it some time and try again maybe he just had something else on his mind the first go round.|`|43b3fc46f5e0746407f46b876475c618aa	Try this, next time you see him just look over at him and when he looks over at you smile, hold eye contact as long as you can but don't be afraid to look away so long as you smile. After a little while do it again when he catches you looking at him smile and make eye contact. Regardless of how bad guys are at nonverbal communication not many will miss this sign. Look for an opportunity to get closer to him and take some interest in whatever he is doing. Guys like girls, we always appreciate the attention and its a lot easier to enjoy a girls company if she's trying to make something happen as well  good luck and don't let the shy excuse keep you from having a good time.|`|0ClZYgYaaa	you gotta be confident....girl..!    think, if u got , dats it..  if he dont liek you, then u wont get him...so dont waste time if u get a result like dat.!..    plus..its none of any yahooguys business...too, cos you are after someother guys...hehe..just jokin sweety    good luck...and be confident...  and if he dont accept you..., then tell urself..dat " i dont give a fcuk to someone eho dont care abpout me"...- dats da best way to overcome situtuions like dis    seya  joe
3f8rvowZaa	Guys are funny that way... if you pay no attention to them they can't get enough of you - if you act too much like you want them they keep their distance.  Who knows why they are the way they are??  I say just ignore the situation as much as you can - hang out with your friends.  Don't talk to him unless he talks to you.  Don't look at him to notice if he's looking at you.  Either he will make a move in your direction, or he won't.  And it's possible that when and if he does, you will have moved on to a new guy!|`|AA11996507	He's not interested.  Focus on your studies.  That'll be a lot better for your future than analyzing this guy's every stare.|`|8vyhc3sEaa	start ignorin him n pretend he doesnt exist... gonna be hard for a bit but trust me he'll come runnin to u once he feels ur not interested in him anymore ! ;) always works
d4LFKlLOaa	He sees you as a trustworthy friend only. People are rough to the ones they confide in because they know you care. If his behavior makes you ucomfortable at school simply tell him in the safety of your messaging that you don't think you can help him anymore. Don't be the fool he is trying to make of your sincere desire to be a friend.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	He basically is looking at you as a friend stand point then. Try flirting back with him and see where it goes, because I think he is hoping for more... atleast that's what it sounds like!|`|1K1pdQDCaa	Why r u thinking about him. If you feel him than talk directly. He has no problem. You are making problem yourself.
005a9dec26e573113e2eee596c25e980aa	Tell him that there is no other man you would want to be with.  That he is exactly what you want.  Show him you love him and care about him.  Do not mention his looks at all.  I am sure he is not completely unattractive, as you would say so.  He may be a little insecure about his looks, but there is so much more to him than just that, just as you are so much more than just a pretty face.|`|1d1e60e9f012becd316f8179f203f17baa	If u are as pretty as you say u are, then u can't blame him for not feeling like mister CHARMING! However, 2 make his "not matching up to u,less of an issue  try not to divert from it,accept it. Dont tell him that he looks fine, tell him that u are attracted to guys with his kind of imperfections, and that it hurts you to see him degrade the man you love.|`|8vyhc3sEaa	ur an indian aint ya ? first how do u guys marry someone u don know ??????and if u rreally like him shouldnt bother u  how he feels or thinks if hes insecure bout how is looks r wateva n u still wanna be with him... jus tell him to get over it n be more secure cause he needs to.. hows he gunna deal with a marriage if he cant deal with a woman that actually wants to marry him inspite of his insecurities..............if he brings it up again......... ask him does he wanna be with u or not? or hed rather u told him how ugly or wateva he was for him to feel comfy lol|`|02cb188aae188ae296bf21c39eabe64eaa	Tell him that he is very handsome to you. Try complimenting him more often, don't go overboard but occassionally say something to help build his confidence.
b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	Looking is ok....making comments is extremely rude.    I've been with women when one walks by...I look and that's it...nothing wrong with looking...shows a healthy sex drive|`|F4USj04zaa	He should keep it to himself, that reminds me of a commercial for nerds where the guy sits his wife down and shows her his bachelor party videotape.     He's treating you like one of the guys, it's stupid. You're right to be annoyed by it. He's either just really dumb, or he wants to bring it up on purpose, but either way, it's not an accident.    You're an idiot, Tom.|`|Nl2IWIV1aa	because we are the ultimate humping machines|`|WyyUeoYHaa	It sounds like you are insecure.  Just because he loves you doesn't rule out the fact that some people are physically attractive. The fact that he points things out to you so openly means that he's obviously comfortable around you. Some guys will hide it, and that's when you should be worried.|`|2e6b63593deee4333c524ac68cf22a52aa	No offense, but your husband is an idiot. He actually tells you that?  All men check out women, but it's extremely rude to do it in the presence of your wife or girlfriend.  But to actually comment on it!? I've never met a guy THAT dumb.  Maybe he's just trying to make you jealous. Slap him upside the head next time he does that.
af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	Some guys are real jerks and they just want girls because they're pretty and they want to show off with them or they just want them for their bodies and to use their bodies. Don't pay any attention to jerks like that. If there was another explanation, it would be that he was struck by your beauty.|`|3bf7834931abf3d24cdb80573559e46aaa	He wants to have your babies obviously.  Seriously though, it meant nothing.

If you had sex two times, the first time must have been good enough for her to try you out again. The average size of a penis is 6 inches. Most woman can't even tell the difference unless it is extremely large or small. If you have confidence when you are fully at attention, you shouldn't worry. Besides depending on your ages and experience, neither of you may know the difference. I dated a guy from 18-22 and from start to finish he grew enough to make a difference. He never got over his insecurities and caused a lot of damage to the relationship, so let it go. If she likes you for the right reasons she shouldn't worry about the size anyway.
7ECTZskTaa	I think she wants more, but you have to appear to be a real serious guy. Be serious and straightforward with her. You'll lose nothing really.    Good luck!|`|AA11972412	Keep flirting more and see how she reacts if shes ok with it then keep going and you will start to see how far she is comfortable with.

AA11618874	The period is mother nature and we never f*** with mother nature. So I would not recommend trying to rely on chemicals of any sort to delay or stop your biological clock. But I will help you overcome the psychological battle you have to face about it.     What is Valentine's Day really about? It isn't about sex, or even physical connection. It is about true love, friendship, and the power of personal fondness for another. Your fiancee will want sex, but nature said no. Sorry but you'll have to be creative if you really want a coupe de gras to match sex. Being a female means you might have to make some sacrifice sexually. Again, I am sorry, but it is a natural fact. You can pleasure him sexually, (oral, hand job, etc.), but it may not be a great idea for him to do the same for you.     Try to enjoy the pure romance of the evening and if you wish for him to gain a sexual release as the finisher to the evening, you can take your pick of non-vaginal sex-play. After all, about 99% of the sexual intercourse creatures of any species have is purely business used for procreation or genital pleasure only. The only time romance or love enters into it is when you don't have sex, but you make true passionate love to one another.    I hope he's cool about the fact that he can't have sex w/ you. Best wishes.
3EpCsHG0aa	You can have a get together (or a Reunion) almost anywhere you can think of.  Have a picnic at a local Park District or Forest Preserve.  Organize a family event at a Theme Park or Zoo.  Most restaurants have Party Rooms or make it a Dinner Dance at a Banquet Hall.      A fun game idea is to have a "Trivia Hunt" - ask in advance for volunteers to share interesting stories, unique skills or family history.  Prepare a list and have everyone try and figure out who shared the information by asking questions to get to the answer.  Volunteers should have a special color name tag so family members know who to ask.  This is fun for all ages and be sure to acknowledge the winners!!

fn4ZLN9daa	It seems like it was just a defense mechanism and his automatic reaction to you saying just be friends was to show you he's worth it by running out and dating the first person he comes across.    It might be his way of showing you he's desirable to others.    Maybe try and communicate via text/email to explain how you feel before arranging a face to face meet up.  If you get to explain the way you see things he might accept why you said to take things slow.

AA10982164	You should definitely continue to email him. Let him know how you and your family are doing, and that you think about them and are concerned that they are doing well.    I understand with the cost of international phone calls why that is not a good option, but emails are great, and even if you ae not getting replies right now, continue to update him every couple of weeks, at least you won't be breaking any family ties, and he will probably start responding to you.    I think if you send the emails about every 2 weeks AND on holidays and special days, that will not be too much.|`|QRSRJ7U1aa	I don't know your culture or how your family functions in side that culture but it sounds to me like you need to gain self-confidence.  If you write interesting email once every week would not be too often.  But if you really don't have much to talk about and its just a polite ritual "We are all fine ...how are you?"  then once a month is more than adequate.  Good letter writing and good phone conversations are both talents that can be cultivated. Discussing what books you are reading or new topics you are taking up in your education can be interesting.  Telling humorous stories about the family (that are not embarassing) help keep family ties strong too.  Hope this helps.|`|10oCEDMuaa	It is still important that you are communicating with him. Maybe you should keep the e-mails short and only on occasion. If you just go one email a month and let him know if he needs you to stop emailing just let you know. Or, you could just send emails on certain occasions - like holidays/birthdays/life changing events.     Just talk to him about it. :)|`|c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	Sending him an email to his job is not a good ideal to my personal opinion. It is hard to determine if he is upset. My advice is to go to google and find the free Ecards and make one for him. In your Ecard explain how concern your are about him and the family, and to thank Allah that no one was hurt. He would appreciated your concern. God bless.|`|Yy28UP2aaa	Do like he said and send him one or two e-mails a month. Even if he doesn't respond to every one, he will still know you care about him and that is what is important. I am assuming every one who's job is in finance is pretty stressed right now. It doesn't sound like you were rude to him on the phone at all, you're probably making a big deal out of nothing so don't worry, just continue to e-mail or write him once or twice a month.
6DmX7N7uaa	Yes indeed it can be considered a crime most especially when we talk about the safety of your family.  But there is always hope and you should never give up.

How cute they are when they argue    12. The way her hand always finds yours    13. The way they smile    14. The way you feel after you see her name on your cell after you just had a big fight    15. The way they say "lets not fight anymore"- even though you know that an hour later...    16.

It was really pretty.|`|rmQKOcp5aa	Well red  looks nice with light/white beige. My sister did those colors in Valentines day and it looks nice she had little Beige/golden angels as the Center pieces surrounded by roses. The angels complemented the color of the dress.  You may not like the idea but when u take a look at the work already set, it would look good....... hope that idea helps you....|`|JCAgvgTxaa	White and black, with red accents.

ohi0kM6Raa	"financial considerations" - depends, if you like the lifestyle and just don't wanna leave it cause your broke *** doesn't make enough, then yes you are a whore.  however if your partner is supported you through getting an MBA or the like and you don't have the funds to finish it.  then ride that pony, look out for no. 1, and let the divorce settlement take care of it.  but then again all this could be used as evidence|`|POzCKBzvaa	You seem confused.

5r2Csdzwaa	Tell him you want to suck it like a chicken bone. If he does not loose his load behind that, he's a complete DOLT!|`|fGE7hL12aa	Tell him what turns you on. Don't be afraid to describe it in graphic detail. Share a fantasy you never told him before. Ask him about his fantasies.    Then you have to ask yourself what you want in return. Do you want to tease him while you talk dirty? Do you want him to tease himself? Is their a fantasy you want him to fulfill?    Where do you stop? Maybe you don't.|`|RAVTTlO4aa	you say whatever you want..have fun|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	any flattering comments about his member scores points. Tell him what you like about it, what you want him to do with it (or what you want to do to it)...and don't forget the f word  : )|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Most guys like one of two categories:    1. Flattering: This is the oooohs and ahhhhs and the word of encouragement area. Telling him that it's so good and you want more. Telling him what you love and how it makes you feel.     2. Requests/Demands: This is more orientated around what you want (and can't wait) for him to do. These are instructions. Do this here. Put that there. Harder or softer. They help a guy lock in to what you enjoy.    Of course, both categories can be explored romantically (you make me feel so in love when you do this) or dirtily ( I want your ......... in my ......... .)    In the end, there really are no wrong things to say....just varying levels of effectiveness. Keep it complimentary and you can do no wrong.     Exploring it is part of the fun! Enjoy!    Good Luck!|`|d09d636d7ee51e3ee6fab5d0ec5f9d82aa	talk about how *ahem* big he is...how he makes you feel great, get specific, name body parts. say how you feel and where. He should be giving you feedback (guys who like dirty talk usually like to respond) and see which subject he responds most to and elaborate.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	Express what you are feeling, tell him exactly how to touch you, he will appreciate it and you will love the results.|`|QKnKjYzQaa	Ok. Here it is from a man's point of view. You should repeat things like: "harder, harder, give it to me, give it to me, yes, yes" and if he's into swearing and all, just yell "mother F$%^@" but here's the golden tip, rub both of his nipples while you say that and he'll be done in 10 seconds!
4R93xF8naa	bad bad bAD  don't ignore him anymore, you 2 did enough of that.  trust me he will get hella butt-hurt, if u keep on ignoring him.  watever u do dont tel him u like him..try to give him hints, let him figure it out on his own, just flirt [u can never go wrong with flirting]   and i dont know maybe mention something that will make him realize u still care for him, like "u look nice today" or "pay attention in class, i want u to do good"....or just something like that, get me??  well hope i helped!!!!!!!!!!!!! =]  and if that does not work i guess u should just have a talk [serious talk] about how u 2 still feel towards eachother|`|NrbLdZzOaa	This is why people should have a license to date...

Are you dumb? you broke up with him for all you know you guys could of still been together if you havent broken up with him.

He went out with another girl to make you jealous.  Find out if this is the right guy for you and go from there, but tell him the true.  Why did you break with him?|`|qsEirDDZaa	You should flirt back with him and tell him you still like him.

2P2K0rl2aa	You are right, he won't change but.....there is plenty you can do to make life easier on yourself.    The cold hard truth is, you are suffering from the effects of low self esteem because you allowed it to happen.  You do not deserve it, but you allowed it.  Human beings work on a reward system - when you don't stand up to him, you are unwittingly rewarding him for his behaviour.  He's using criticism to knock the wind out of your sails, it's working and he knows it.  He has taken your power away from you and now you have to get it back.    Next time he does it, stand up.  Say to him 'don't treat me like that, I don't deserve it and it makes me feel (fill in the blank).  He will argue, make you think you are crazy, call you 'too sensitive'.  Don't argue back, and don't justify yourself.  Go back to the original point you made eg 'yes I understand that you are frustrated, but you mustn't treat me like that, it's not okay'.  Don't use accusatory words like 'you always, you never, you're a this, you're a that'    You must keep doing this over and over again and not back down.  If he does it again remind him by saying 'I have already told you not to treat me this way and you are doing it again, please stop it'.      It takes a lot of work, but it's worth the effort.  The least it will do is make you feel better about yourself, and if you find you need to leave the relationship, you will have th confidence to do it.  If you don't want to leave the relationship, it will make you strong enough to put him back in his box when he deserves it.|`|PseVmBS8aa	This sucks for you and I am sorry, I have been through that also for four years among other things then just left for good one day.You cant live like this, he must change or you will go down the drain like you already are. It is hard to be strong by you self when the person you look at for support isn't there. It will eventually lead to a divorce.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	I was in a relationship like this.  My ex had me so down on myself, I didn't even think I could make simple decisions without him and that's what he wanted because it was a way to stay in control.    Unfortunately, I don't think this kind of thing will get better without counseling. You shouldn't have to change you to build a wall so you can protect yourself from being hurt by your husband. He's the one person who should not hurt you, and if he's not willing to do that, then you shouldn't be with him.    I finally left my ex and it took about a year for me to build up the self-esteem that had been eroded by all his insults and the same kind of stuff you mentioned. I'm now dating a wonderful guy who would never ever do that. It's such a difference.  You deserve someone like that.|`|wi0CSqNSaa	Talk about it. If you cant talk about this with your husband who can you talk to it about. Im sure he doesnt even notice the problem.|`|0uwyi2Ovaa	I swim laps at the local pool.
80CRvSyhaa	True love is something that cannot be measured by words alone. For instence, When you lie awake at night and that person is the only thing you have on your mind, like I do. Or through out the day you can't get that person out of your mind, like I do. Some actions that may seem or be harsh, do not difine love. Love is something you feel down into your very being, like I do. Like the thought of you being with another guy, doesn't make me jealous. It hurts, knowing it should be me. That is love. And one true test of love is to let someone go, if they come back to you then that is love. Take Rochelle for example. Yes she is my wife, and part of me would take her back. But in all reality, I know it would never work, because she doesn't love me. So I don't even try. Fact is, listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Who really makes you happy? and who can provide you a better future?|`|7THgBSvfaa	Love is a four letter word..  And a 3 word phrase...|`|KwNpyp3saa	It is true lots of people just throw those words around so easily. When they do, it usually has no meaning.     If someone tells you they love you, the best way to tell if they mean it is by their actions. Is he/she there for you when you need them? Are they caring?     To me, if they are still around through the hard stuff and they still tell you they love you, this is something you can believe.     I hope this helps.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Actions will always speak louder than words. Pay more attention to what they do for love instead of what they say for love. When both words and actions correlates than you know they really love you. If you just have one without the other, than they are full of it.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	If that person is able to go out of their way to be there for you in a time of need.

yTD84yFlaa	Whats the point of even bringing it up?    Honestly, this kind of thing is going to happen 100 times more often once you graduate HighSchool; so you should probably just get used to the idea of falling out of contact with people.|`|YPAHeUucaa	So, you're beginning to dislike her for the way she is portrayed as a "prep"? The way you're putting it makes you look like a total jerk.    It sounds like you want to kick someone to the curb becaue of how they look. She lives in a different area and I'm sure she has some new friends. If you were any kind of friend, you would know that she's growing up and changing and would try to accept that and be a good friend. Instead, you're whining about the label she is. Some friend you are.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	I think that you should just be open up with her and tell her straight up how you feel about the friendship status.  Dont beat aroun the bush becuase it will cause you to dwell off on othe things tht doesnt have to do with the fact tht you trying to get her to understand...doing this would be easier because if she was a tru friend she would understand....which i'm hoping is the outcome    GOOD LUCK!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	do you really want to risk a friendship over something petty like this.|`|pqyLfCNVaa	well if you really want to stay friends, make an effort to keep in touch.text her or something    but if you don't, just sit back and let you guys drift apart. that way, it wouldn't seem like your fault for ending the friendship if you tell her that you guys couldn't be friends anymore. if you just drift apart, nobody's to blame|`|AA11922229	People change. That's life. Be the best you that you can be.|`|AA12381907	thats sort of happened to me.  we were drifting so much.  i didn't want to...but i just let it happen.    we don't talk anymore.  but sometimes theres that occasionall  akward "hi" .|`|bn1Cw4sYaa	Just tell her to stop being a betch.|`|W05piyBxaa	my ex best friend was being a ***** so same problem sorry|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	ITS YOU DUDE|`|t1mDtvJsaa	just slowly stop emailing and texting back (btw this also works for guys who are stalking u) then just stop emailing/texting her at all.  if she asks whats up then tell her u dont get a lot of time on the comp/phone.  then stop hanging out with her.  but make sure ur making the rite choices.... because u dont want to lose a good friend|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	just let it go, and don't make an effort to be her friend if you don't want to be her friend any longer. As time passes, the friendship may fade if you don't make an effort to be her friend. I wouldn't stress about it, or tell her you can't be her best friend anymore|`|j4hmUPJgaa	When I was in junior high one of my good friends told me that I was changing- she wrote me a letter & told me that I 'prided myself along' b/c I hung out with the popular people. It made me mad & was uncalled for- all she really had to do was start ignoring me & I would have got the hint.  Do not write a letter or anything like that- just do your own thing. There does not have to be a formal ceremony for dismissing a friend. It sounds like you may be a little irritated with her new status- just let it go- you guys don't even go to the same school. If she calls you & wants to hang out- you don't have to be mean to her.|`|MxlPiMgaaa	yup, get used to it. most ppl come and go, not all, but most.  its kinda, normal in a way.  just live your life - enjoy time with the ppl you love and care about when you get to see them or hang out with them.  I definitely isnt worth stressing over. If it bothers you that much then talk to her about it, tell her how you feel.  if you can get over it and can understand that ppl are gonna change then just chill because somethimes ppl dont like to be confronted and told that they have changed and things like that.  if she wants to hang out then hang out, of course not with the preps. and if she doesnt then she might go through a phase where she will get caught up with her new freinds, but dont get mad just let it go. and you never know she might realize her new friends are stupid and come back. no matter what happens yall have been freinds a long while. and if one day she comes back to you then be happy and be there for her.  you asked a question that no one can really answer.  ppl are just to complicated and ever  changing.  just dont ever burn your bridges over nothing and if you do cut ties with someone then it should be for a good reason.   just remember the golden rule and if you care for someone then be there if they need you even if you are the only one that cares in the freindship.   keep life simple and it will make better sense. - just a few suggestions.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	wow!, ive got to say that, your very responsible for your age.    just let it roll on its own. contact her less, and start to ignore her. soon she will forget about you, and you will not feel the stress of dumping her.|`|fSoqa6mdaa	comunication is the key to every relationship, but just but honest to her, and you can talk things out.    if that doesn't work, i can be your best friend ;)|`|AA10503158	People change it's a part of life. True friends stay close! And nothing wrong with texting haha not just the "preps" doing it.|`|yllIJiGraa	ya this sorta happened to me and i just let it happen|`|dyPFkK4Daa	don't judge her on who she hangs out with, but rather how she treats you.  if you make an effort to hang out and be BFFs and she still is being a jerk to you, then just tell her how it is, and that you don't appreciate how she's been treating you, and then move on.  don't hold it against her though, always allow for someone to change, especially when so young.|`|fJjgFWDRaa	Stop being dramatic - friends come and go like blisters on a farmer's hand. It's a good learning experience.|`|89lEF1bwaa	When i was in 7th grade, my best friend ditched me for a bunch of preps. i know how you feel. i think you should still keep in touch, but i dont think you should tell her you dont want to be best friends anymore. what i would do is get a new best friend, and be like oh ya im really sorry that we dont spend see eachother anymore and its really hard to be best friends, is it ok if i get a new one, we will always be friends, but your not acting like a bestie. idk what to do. i just think we should see other people lol. =] hope that helps|`|J6e9WPKFaa	Well you don't necessarily have to tell her you don't want to be her best friend anymore you can just tell her that you don't like how she is hanging out with other people and spending time with them other then you and you want to spend more time with her because she is your best friend and if she is truly your best friend she will change and spend more time with you|`|Cb4vZuIDaa	FIRST OF ALL THATS KIND OF DUMB,JUST CUZ SHE HANGS OUT WITH A CERTAIN "TYPE" OF PEOPLE SECOND THE TEXTING THING?SHE HAS A LIFE LEAVE HER ALONE 3RD IF IT REALLY BOTHERS YOU THEN JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH,IF YOUR GOING YOUR OWN DIFFERENT WAY THEN SHE'S NOT REALLY YOUR BEST FRIEND,AND SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN CARE.BUT IDK IT SEEMS KINDA DUMB TO ME.....|`|WB4NpcX3aa	Hey i know just what your going through, btw im 14 too. What i did with my best friend was i didn't really tell her i just let us grow apart and it wasn't the best thing to do so i suggest just talking it out with her in a nice calm way just say that you feel like you guys are slowing parting away from eachother and you don't want that to happen and say that you don't really get along with her new friends and say that it would be nice to regain our friendship that we've carried for seven years. but don't be like i hate ur friends and why the heck did you ditch me cause then you'll get in a HUGE fight. and also tell her that you think that she is changing into something that she's not but all people change just remeber that but be sure to stay close to her because the preps could be using her and let her down hard it's happened to me before.|`|kP1AnhzUaa	ok i have had this problem 2 first tell her how u feel than say "we have been friends for 7 years and u kind of r been mean and if this go on any more something bad is going 2 happen and those years willl count as nothing do u really want them 2 go away???" than say "if u get mad at me its undersatndable but we can be friends and u can change ur ways or we dont have 2 be friends and u can stay the same" and that will give her a chance 2 think than have her answer when its the right time so u dont have 2 let her down u can also keep her!!!!!|`|znxFD103aa	Yes, this has happened to me. You said yourself that the relationship is growing apart, so just let it do it on it's own. In time you will meet new friends and it wont seem like a big deal. You dont have to tell her anything, unless you want to. If you feel like she has betrayed your friendship., and you dont even want to be civil with her anymore, thats a different story. But if u wanna stsy cool without being BEST friends, thats easy, just let yourself grow apart from her. OR If she asks you to do things, say you are busy and so forth. After a few times she will get the hint : )|`|zdr2M7vUaa	hmm i know it aint right to give u ideas thats not right but if thats what u ask i have no choice  if i were u ill just turn my back and walk away from everything that ever mattered and everything that u guys had in commen and just let her be a prep and u find some friends that are going to be there for u|`|Q0lFFHKVaa	I don't think the problem is with her, it is with you. You should not discredit a whole group of people based on how they dress or what clique they belong to (preps, jocks, goths). I made this mistake myself by disliking people because they were preps. Once I actually befriended a few of them, they turned out to be some of the coolest people ever.
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Been married 22 years.    Married a woman with  2 kids - she had been divorced for 8 years when I met her.  Her ex-husband had been totally out of the picture - kids never saw him.    We were together as a family for 5 years.  Then the kids hit 18 - and no more child support was due - their father started coming back into their life.  And the kids started saying how much they had missed having their Dad around.  The Dad wanted the kids to do things with him - but only those things that he selected.  Never anything the kids picked out.    The more time passes, the more their Dad pushes back into the picture.  But he is still living with the woman he was dating while married to their Mom.    At every family get together - the kids and their Mom talk about the Dad.  Even at my birthday party (he wasn't invited).  Not just a couple of questions, but they can go on for hours about him.  Their family trait is to gossip for hours about people.  But he is by far - the center of attention.    I have gotten to the point, (after 22 years of this) that I'm just tired of hearing about him.       When the kids were younger, they didn't talk about their Dad all the time.  When they were younger, not only didn't the Dad want to pay the child support - and it was a small amount - I was putting out more money to support his kids than he was.  But he never wanted to   be around the kids.    I can only remember seeing him at one event when the kids were in their teens.  When his son was 14 and playing little league baseball, the Dad showed up and yelled at his son when he was up to bat.  The Dad kept yelling for the son to hit a GRAND SLAM HOME RUN.  Problem was - there was on one on base - so there was no way anyone could hit a GRAND SLAM HOME RUN.|`|AA12187979	Yes, I wish someone had told me not to put your dick in a women before you get married and don't ever marry a slut.|`|vSJIorF7aa	I would have wanted to live together. Then I would have been slightly more prepared for what to expect. But, all is well now, so no big deal!|`|JGGbQhCaaa	Don't try to be something/someone you are not in order to be what you think the other wants you to be. Be yourself to the max; find someone who digs the real you and can comfortably be them-self with you. Have lots of conversation on a wide variety of issues, concerns and interests. Don't be overwhelmed by the sugar, spice and ecstasy that you lose sight of the totality of the relationship. Good, I repeat, good premarital counseling that helps you see beyond the roses can really help.  Peace and Joy to you and yours.|`|QtaPF83iaa	I wish we talked more about what we wanted from life.  we don't have the same goals and priorities which makes major decisions very difficult|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Gold flecked eyes!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i wish i had looked deeper into his past, and seen how he treated others he was suppose to have loved. but people like my ex hid things well, pretended and showed only his best side before marriage, so some things just can't be seen. some behaviors just aren't seen until after the marriage, when they let down their guard, and the true them emerges.but his family knew, and maybe someone should have warned me about the other 3 wives before me, and how he cheated on them too.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I didn't marry this chick, but one day she pulls me into her bedroom, lifts a case from under her bed, and lifted out a whip.    When I asked her if it was for her....she said "no".    Blew out of that house like a bat outta hell! I don't think I even touched the floor.|`|d09d636d7ee51e3ee6fab5d0ec5f9d82aa	i dont think things like that make much of a difference. You can still fake your way through counseling or hide sides of yourself while living together. the only way you really know a person is time.
69qn7muFaa	I am.  Two Main Reasons.    1. I want my first time to be with someone I love and I know I want to be with them forever. No regrets right?    2. I don't think I'd be ready till marriage, I'm just.. scared haha.|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	Not me.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	That depends on how convincing an argument is made who knows some smooth talking gal might get a standing "OH!" hahaha that's so cheesy!

You always have to think, what if I dont make it that far what if I die first. So you make a compromise and I dont think that your whole life should be based on marrige like everyone says it is, you make your OWN choice, that come with their OWN consequences.|`|c6a9a1a3c9c51130f64f579fb6522cf3aa	never gonna know until it happens, right?|`|81hqHDKHaa	I was going to.  And maybe i should have.  I do regret it somehow, but not so much. All because it wasnt planed.   I lost it to my current love. I was 19 at that time and he was 25, we lost our virginities to each other. And now we are having family issues which may stop us from getting married, but still we r hopeful.  I hope ending up with him.  If its not karma, then i think i will need around 5-10 years to even kiss another guy. I just dont see it.  He was my first kiss, my first real love and everything i have.|`|1qxvF2z0aa	ME!!!!!! {or at least i'm trying}|`|RZfDrdIRaa	I wish i would have!

It all depends. It's not like I'm making it my goal to have sex before marriage, but I am going to wait until marriage if I can.  If I meet the one and it happens, it happens.

That's like buying a shoe without trying it on...which I do all the time...but I can return the shoe!|`|JPBggXcwaa	people say that but its a waste of time...if you do that, it can make you very crabby without sex...although it may feel very special...
HThwnbVtaa	no he cant both of you have to go in to the bank ...maybe he is cheating who knows?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I believe a joint account requires both signatures to open it and both signatures to close it.  He cannot "take your name off" anything you legally signed on to.    That said, you may want to contact your bank and insurance company and give them the heads up.  I suggest you get your direct deposit moved to a new account in your name only.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	wow i really dont know what to tell you but im REALLY sorry you are going through this|`|y8mRKy2vaa	sounds like a jerk but NO he can not take your name off without you signing the paperwork with the bank he is all talk|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Tell him to straighten out or you will notify his commander.  You might want to check with Legal and see how much of what he said is true.    If your husband is deployed, he only was allowed 2 beers last night.  And how was he all over the news?  I watched the news today and didn't see any beer-laden news casts from overseas.    You need to check out all the laws dealing with marriage and divorce to protect yourself now and even years down the road.  Every woman should be prepared in case her husband dies.  I didn't plan on being a widow at age 29, but it happened.  At least, I knew pretty much what we had and what we owed.    As for the military legalities, I know they favor the soldier.  I was amazed that before my son-in-law was deployed, he had to sign a POA stating that my daughter could make medical decisions for their daughter without his permision.  She had no idea that under normal circumstances he has to be notified before major health decisions can be made for their child.|`|NENNHNVPaa	Deployed?  As in he is military?   Military units have support groups for those left at home.  Contact the base chaplin and find out who your support group leader is (it's usually the commanders wife).      As far as getting you removed from the "joint" checking account?  No he can not do that.  The only way he could get your name removed is if he provided the bank with proof of divorce or death.  Now you could take yourself off.      It sounds like he is having trouble dealing with being deployed.|`|5k7BexD3aa	He can't remove your name off of a joint account.  He can close it however...(at our bank you can do that anyway)..  Protect yourself.  If he doesn't make sure you have enough $$$ to live on, THREATEN to go to his command...they'll make him pay.|`|W4vEwsrGaa	if he gave you power of atturney b4 he left i dont think that he can but i could be rong.|`|EmqjOhZOaa	I do not know anything about the army.  I do know that I had a checking joint account with my husband and he did go to the bank and took all the money out and opened an account in his own name.  I was not contacted by the bank.  So it can be done.  I suggest you go to the bank and open your own account and move your direct deposit quick as possible.  Protect yourself before it's to late.  Hope this helps.|`|oj6wQULCaa	I believe a joint account requires both signatures to open it and both signatures to close it. He cannot "take your name off" anything you legally signed on to.    That said, you may want to contact your bank and insurance company and give them the heads up. I suggest you get your direct deposit moved to a new account in your name only.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Go to his chain of command, and go to his PAC office. "Finance" would be at his battalion headquarters. You can find out all the stipulations about the do's and dont's with the money from a finance clerk. BTW, Going to his chain of command is NOT bad for you--you are not in the military ...he on the other might have a bad day so he's lying. Threats to keep the little lady down.  Good luck.|`|auJbcgX1aa	Take a fair share out of it while you can. If you put money in it and he is wanting to do this to you then it's pretty much justified. Don't feel bad for it. this is threatening your life, because you depend on that money for bills, food, and other things you need. You feel like you don''t know him anymore? Thats how it goes when you marry someone in the military - They leave for long periods of time and then the two people grow farther apart from eachother instead of growing together like they should. I'm sorry honey but I hope things work out for you, But seriously take some money out while you can incase he really goes through with this.|`|c3f0288f0795ae4a646f8c1bb917d015aa	Sorry, he only got 2 beers, if any at all!  Remove your name from the account.....don't think so, but he can re-direct his pay to another bank acct in his name only and send you a transfer from that acct to your joint acct. Unless there is a court order telling him other wise, he could send you his BAH and family separation pay and there wouldn't be much you could do about it.  Yes, he can change his SGLI and leave you off the policy completely.    And all the advice from others about going to his chain of command? Go ahead! So many wives/girlfriends/ex's have done this over the years that most commands pretty much ignore these complaints. They've heard this type of complaint thousands of times, yours would be nothing new.  Acting angry? Sure he is, and why not? He's thousands of miles from home, living in crappy conditions, lousy mail service, lousy food, etc, and people trying to kill him on top of all that. Would you be angry in those conditions too?  Best advice.....wait a couple days, try and talk it out, don't demand, don't start with the "cheating" garbage.....that's dirty.
CK6RDZZ1aa	YEPPERZ     ILY |`|KPXwwwMMaa	your true friends will always be there for you in the end.
ypZM5XVQaa	I think this is too hard for you. Love is supposed to be easy at least at first and she keeps giving you mixed signals. One minute its on the next it could be on then its off.  You have to move on. I know its not easy but start dating at least casually and just looking to have fun. You can stay friends but make it clear that you have to get on with your life that you like her and you want to be with her but you cannot wait around forever.  take care dude good luck.

8cuPVvYnaa	Hi, I was married to someone like that and I know how you feel.     I'm not sure how to begin to answer this in this format, without someway to talk back and forth, but I will try. I'll start with your question: "How can I change my reaction to the criticism and insulting words the father of my children say to me?"  When I was in a relationship like yours (worse yes, but similar in that he also yelled and insulted me often), I too tryed to change MY reaction to his insults. As a starting point this is very mature. We can never change someone else but only change ourselves. And with a healthy person if we stay calm and level headed, they too may calm down. But not in every case. I am hesitant to say this, but it sounds to me that he may have a bit of an abusive personality. Some people with that personality never go to physical abuse, others esculate in time to include that. All I know is, if I am right about him having an abusive personality, there is really nothing about YOU that causes this; its inside of him.    That said, no matter why it is happening, words have a way of wounding, perhaps worse than any physical beating. You do need to find a way to keep these words from beating you down. This may be impossible if he continues to do this, but you need to try and reject those words. You may not be able to at the moment he is lashing out at you without causing more of a fight, but when you are alone, speak out loud that you are not what he just described you as. Speak the truth of who you are.     Many men are unwilling to get counseling unless they see that there is no other way without losing their family. I wish there was some way you guys could. You should ask, but don't be surprised if he refuses. If things get worse, you may have to make a strong move in order to insist on this. I truly hope things don't get any worse for you. If he ever gets physical be sure to get help. But like I said, the yelling and insults can often hurt worse than anything so find a way to stay strong while you see if there is any way you two can work things out.    God bless you!
6QIpltVyaa	Well all siblings fight, but how far bad is the treatment? and why does she do it? a good advice would be to try to speak to her or get an intervention (mom, dad, a close uncle or aunt, older cousin that is older then both of you) and see what is she feeling? You will and you must try to resolve this problem as soon as possible..you may be asking why? well humans instinctively can hold resentment for many many years and also bad memories. You don't want to grow up and start realizing that you hate your sister and you want to break up the relationship entirely, and lets say the family gets bigger and you or you sis gets kids... the kids will feel the resentment also. You will also notice that maybe she will give in and start being nice for a few days and then she will go back on the same routine... well don't let her do whatever you did before to make her stop, and keep doing until she will realize how great her little sister is|`|oAyI70W5aa	i guess like everyone will say is talk to her. tell her how you feel (write it) say you dont want to end up badly when you're super old and you want to fix things...      answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|AA11138696	Don't go out  of your way to be nice and try to ignore her as much as you can.  don't let her attitude sour yours but also do not let her bring you down and hurt your feelings.  Expect her to act and react badly and you won't be disappointed when she does and you will be happily surprised if she ever is nice. Don't let her change who you are, just don't expect much from her until and unless she starts to act differently as in nice.|`|AX3DQw3Paa	I would say ignore her. Seriously. You don't deserve this. My sister used to do this to me, but I ignored her. (Sometimes it does take years.) Eventually though, she turned around. Now she's wanting to be nice to me. The only problem is, now I'm not sure I want to hang out with her. Well....that was my only advice. Sorry. *hugs*
1hcupwT4aa	ALL girls? A little quick to generalize, don't you think?    Girls wear makeup to enhance their ALREADY pretty features. I wear very little eyeliner and chapstick (living in an area with dry air) and it looks so much better than I do without it. I'm not covering anything up, just making it more noticeable.    Not all girls are sluts, either. I don't wear short shorts, I don't have highlights, I'm fairly confident with myself to know I don't have to degrade myself to get attention.    Try not to get too full of yourself, kay? Not all girls are blessed with being pretty like you (like you say you are?) so they do something about it to give them more confidence. Nothing is wrong with that.    Yes, some girls go to extremes but that isn't anyone's business but their own. What matters is how they feel about themselves, not what the judgmental world thinks.|`|fijYOZg1aa	Teenage girls are shallow. Sorry, babe.|`|YPAHeUucaa	You're very mature for being a teenager. It's great that you don't hate yourself like the rest of today's youth, so kudos to you!    But, anyway, everything in America is so fabricated and fake, and so it's almost impossible for girls (and boys too!) to feel confident and attractive on an everyday basis. Truth is, sex sells. This is why every pair of shorts in almost every store looks like underwear.     I wear makeup. Mostly to hide my zits, but I don't go overboard with eyeliner or anything like that. However, many girls I see have raccoon eyes and bright red lipstick. Can you say fake?     You're right, girls are silly. People really need confidence boosts nowadays!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	They are a bunch of conceited, spoiled, little rotten materialistic brats!|`|r8owV9esaa	im just like you.. all natural and if i can pull it off im sure all the other girls can,, thier lil f*ckin sluts|`|AA12029875	teens  have too much  of everything.|`|kpPOzMpeaa	i'm a teenager, too, and i agree. but i wear makeup (bare minerals, mascara, lip gloss.) even though i believe in being yourself. short shorts are okay as long as they don't reveal too much, and highlights are just a way of getting attention and looking 'cool', even though sometimes they look like ****. =) the main reason for all of this is just attention from boys and everyone else. period.|`|22f5tSZQaa	its cause.. usually girls dont think their that pretty so they wear short skirts and like low tops so people pay attention to their curves instead of their face.|`|1KajpBdaaa	i agree hetfield =] good for u that u dont wear all that...i see gurls in class doin their makeup its sooo stupid...a little make up is ok|`|6mLQvA7iaa	well, i think people just want to be like everyone else.    my question is, who decided what the "everyone else" mold is?  because they must have been on crack or something.|`|kyyEhr8Waa	it's called the media|`|C4c8jFvsaa	I wear makeup because i feel pretty, and its also a form of art! I don't pack it on at school, but when i do special occations, i have fun with makeup.     I have highlights in my hair because i like my hair lighter. What is the big deal?    Just because girls wear make-up, do their hair and try to look pretty does not make them conceited. I am not.   However, the short shorts thing, i agree. Girls need to cover up and not show so much skin.|`|8rAAjXusaa	I don't wear make-up or short skirts. :S So there :P|`|k9njLOLuaa	Well we try, because we like to be even more pretty and play up our features. I dont know why some girls wear SO much of it but I think that a little bit of mascara and eyeliner can really help bring you from cute, to beautiful. You should try just putting a little bit on and see what you get, and maybe try a light hilight in your hair you might be surprised.|`|8oX0wZAIaa	Don't worry, I know the feeling. Just think in your head "man, I wonder how they'd look without all the makeup, highlights and showing off their bodies...."    Probably not better than you...

Be yourself hun :D|`|gRsuXxkbaa	hollywood has tricked them all into thinking thats wats hot - curse u Paris Hilton !!!! lol|`|E0yIdPytaa	you know what I hate about teenage girls, too?    they're so stuck up|`|SI8MYdzpaa	i agree with your wholeheartedly. it's just that they aren't fortunate enough to love themselves like you or me.
BBlfetz3aa	it sounds as if he has a self esteem issue. he has been surrounded by rejection in his life and feels he to let go of you before he negatively affects your life. i believe he still has feelings for you ( at least he did before the cousin situation) but just needs to be reassured that the feeling is mutual

Syp350ieaa	Your friend is in an abusive relationship. People may try to tell her to leave, but much like addiction, she will not be able to leave the relationship until she is absolutely ready to do it on her own. The only thing you can do is to keep talking to her and have patience with her. Her self esteem is low and she is depressed and she may feel incapable of leaving because the lies he is telling her are working against her self image. She might try to leave him over and over but then go back to him when he starts talking sweet. I read once that it takes the average abused woman 12 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. The only thing you can do is offer her your support. There are many books at the library or bookstores about abusive relationships. Maybe if she can read about what's happening, she will be able to view her circumstances more objectively from a perspective that is not so close to the situation and find a way out. You sound like a very good friend. I wish the best for you both.|`|RAVTTlO4aa	i think u dont say anything mind yr own business..|`|M9wAOlk3aa	she has to get the strength the improve the situation and start demanding more respect herself  women like this will often resent anyone else who try to help them out so i think you need to not get involved , they let the partner treat them like shi .. but heaven forbide anyone speak badly of him
0FXVTZf7aa	Send him to the website below and ask him to prove that this guy is wrong about premarital sex in the Bible.  He says it's not a sin.|`|N4X8VSUvaa	I think you should be glad that your boyfriend has  respect for you. You said that you love him so much,  Did you ever listen to what he was saying and why?  He cares about your soul and all you worry about is your body.  I give him credit for his strength it isn't easy for him. He enjoyed sex he is not brain dead he remembers how he felt. Communicate with him.  Words are powerful.  Don't you think he is worth marrying?  Do you respect him? I would think if you try to seduce him you are giving him a signal you don't care what he thinks.    If he is a new Christian he would learn as he goes not to be unequally yoked.  But apparently he thinks you are worth it and wants to give you respect.  Yes, adults have to make decisions it is part of growing up.   Was your decision to have sex before marriage a wise one?   Maybe if you decided differently then you wouldn't have to worry about this decision. If you really love him and not just lust after him you will show him  some respect for his belief and talk about what is important.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Surely his beliefs in other areas have changed as well. Does he expect a wife to be subservient to her husband? Does he want to have as many kids as possible? Is he going to forbid things like wine from the house? Is he going to expect you to go to church and bible study and whatnot several times a week?    If any of those are true, then they will have a big impact on your life after marriage. Getting married just so you can have sex with him is getting married for the wrong reasons. Marriage does NOT solve relationship problems, and in fact existing problems usually get worse after marriage.|`|yrtlMEKgaa	I'm a communist atheist, my girlfriend is a capitalist christian and it never gets in our way. You either learn to make room for your partners beliefs or leave.|`|5PBfj1EEaa	well you should try to compromise with his decision but at the same time he should've talked to u about his decision before he made it. if u dont feel ready to marry him then dont. dont rush things for the wrong reasons. just think when u finally have sex its be the best thing ever because its been so long.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	No, don't rush to the altar. Just respect his beliefs, it is admirable that he would control himself even after having had sex with you before. If you can't deal with this beliefs don't try and bring him down, just move on yourself. Don't want to sound harsh but you should let him believe as he wants to.|`|fWrygrgMaa	You have to come to terms with the fact that this might be over. Find confidence in that. Realize that you are still you, no matter what. You were you before you met him, you'll be you after. Then talk to him about it. Be very straight forward. Explain in careful detail exactly how you feel about him and this issue. You will have to decide whether or not you want to stay with him. Be prepared to leave. Yeah, it sucks.     DO NOT rush into marriage. This would be the person you share every aspect of your life with. You should be able to be completely open. You must be able to function as a team, making accommodations for each other, all the time. I highly recommend couples live together for a while, a year or so, have sex, go places, do things, be on the same page for raising children and finances, decide which way the toilet paper roll goes, before getting married. If you're annoyed instead of entertained by a person's quirks you probably shouldn't be with them. It should be easy. If it's hard work you probably shouldn't be with them. I've been happily married for 13 years and getting better every day. It works for us. But I don't recommend it. Almost all of our friends have been divorced.    Jellybeanchick is right on, marriage doesn't solve relationship problems.    He's being ridiculous. But that's what 'born again' christianity is all about. You can't be born again, we're all only born once. Even the term is silly. He's already had premarital sex. Think how silly 'saving' himself is now. It's difficult enough or two people to just relate, we don't need artificial boundaries. He likely has other views that have changed. You'll want to examine them as well. He is irrational, good luck.|`|DGSw0rqYaa	If you really love him as much as you say you do, and do not want to lose him, then you should respect his decision and stand by him.  He will appreciate you more in the end for it.|`|30nzrpnCaa	dont rush to do anything you dont want to. and dont rush him. he changed and thats not your fault. i think that since he doesnt hve the same value systems you fell in love with, then its best you go your separate ways. tell him that god would forgive him because after all you both formed a relationship before he converted. ask him if he can compromise with that or at least kiss you|`|M79usPMkaa	The ****, you shouldn't try to push your beliefs on him.  If you can't cope figure out another plan -- there's plenty of ways to fix this situation but obviously every single way is going to be done for the wrong reason.  So do it for the RIGHT reason(Hopefully you REALLY love him)    ..Hell, there's always the porn industry though if you're looking to get nailed.|`|h99Mcg6taa	Marrying someone for sex can't possibly e good.  Tell him you have needs and it's not like you haven't done it before.  Is this his way of trying to get you to marry him?|`|WpCwTxN5aa	Whatever you do, don't use this as a reason to get married!  Young marriages have a low chance of success, and you can see why... people are still changing what's important to them in their life, and if you go one way and he goes another, that's bad news.    Your best option is to just break this off.  Then you can each find someone who's compatible with your beliefs about sex.
enwlp6oIaa	Aha I'm 14 too.    Depends on his personality really. And it depends on your budget.  If he's a sports fan try some tickets to the next leafs or raptors games.    It doesn't have to be big either as long as it's from the heart.  Like spending special time with him on V-Day. Going to see a movie,   bring him out to his favorite restaurant/buy him his favorite food.  Spent some quality one on one time with him (not sexual   just stay at one of each others house and hang out, rent out a DVD order some pizza or Chinese. :)      These are just a few of the many idea's I'm sure you can think of something that goes along these lines.|`|0qSpreVyaa	I'm a guy... 16 dating for 1 month... all i want from my girlfriend it to know she cares about me and is thinking of me!

Make him a mix cd, buy him some candy or a stuffed animal.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	give him your love. i think you two should sit down and watch a movie or something. i mean both of you are 14 there's not that much you can do lol|`|5BlWxijkaa	candy with a sweet note or you should go see a movie and eat dinner and then get him something simple becasue i think it is better when you get somebody something simple and romantic|`|8926df5af8e7cec717561d7fcd237c90aa	Only 2 months? How bout cologne?|`|OOptQPnFaa	cd, candy, ur love lol, idk|`|YNssCMkfaa	Your Love and probably a kohls gift card or movies gift card or something you can do together.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	You dont ness. need to get him anything for V-day , just being together on that day I think is good enough.` BUt traditionally, chocolate, card, etc.|`|IdCNh6p5aa	Don't get him too much! You don't want to come on too strong if you have only been dating for 2 months. If he likes movies maybe take him there, and pay! I know that my boyfriend really likes mountain dew so i usually get him that and some of his favorite candy, and instead of going to the movies, i usually invite him over, and we have a movie night! Guys think its cute when you can watch whatever and be able to snuggle on the couch!|`|WKxnAHpjaa	get him a cheesy card and some candy|`|EpOU7vGYaa	buy him something that he likes to do.  for example: if he likes to listen to music, buy him a cd.  if he likes to play sports, buy him a football.  just ask him what he likes to do, ect.  or you can buy him something meaningful. like a necklace with your name on it or a necklace that says i love you.  nothing big, jsut something meaningful  hope this helps!|`|3kydegQJaa	You don't want anything too serious this early, or at your age.  But you do want it to be somewhat meaningful.  I would suggest something that shows you've put some thought into it, not just money.  Something that shows you listen when he talks, and care about (or are at least aware of) the things that he cares about.  Maybe he mentioned something that he really wants, like a CD or video game.  Or something that pertains to a specific interest he has... like if he plays guitar you could get him a guitar strap, or if he plays basketball get him some new shorts, you get the idea.  It shouldn't be anything big at this point, just something that shows you pay attention to him and what he's interested in, so he knows how awesome of a girlfriend you are!|`|HKFxBCHtaa	At 14 a few good gift ideas are :movies, sweatshirts, cd's, cologne.    You should bake him some cupcakes too:)|`|AwDFPBdxaa	NOTHING.  The best thing you can do for your boyfriend is agree to never give gifts on Hallmark Holidays.

AA11138696	When the couple cannot decide the ball is in the Bride's court.  Traditionally the Bride's family put on the wedding and they had it at a place of their choosing.  This can happen when each want it in their own church.  It is considered to be the Bride's day so in the case of a stalemate, Bride'side wins.|`|8926df5af8e7cec717561d7fcd237c90aa	I say have it in the town that you and your fiancee live in. Your guests should accomodate to your needs. You can't please everyone.|`|AA11737190	It should be at the bride's hometown. The bride's family traditionally hosts the wedding.|`|mPKDmMJoaa	Sometimes compromise if the only solution.    Somewhere in the middle would be perfect.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	Traditionally, weddings were held in bride's hometown.  That just made it easier for bride and her mom to handle the planning.      Of course, that was in the day when bride's parents paid for most of the wedding expenses.    So I think we would need more info before advising you on this.  Who is paying for this wedding?  Who will handle the majority of the planning?    Cos if groom is paying for most of the wedding expenses . . . then yes, he would definitely get a say.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	Traditionally, the wedding is in the bride's hometown.  However, there are many factors that should be considered there too.  For instance, if the bride's family is small and the groom's family is big, it would only make sense for the bride's family to travel.    Another reason would be like mine - I don't actually have a church building (we meet in a school).  He does have a huge church in his hometown.  We will probably end up getting married in his hometown just for logistics.      If all else fails, halfway sounds good - It's not like you're several hours apart where halfway is the middle of nowhere and you know nothing/no one there.  You could probably use the same people (caterer, florist, etc...), so it's all about choosing a venue.|`|DqetlSB6aa	halfway is fair to everyone|`|8bETrOtqaa	I think the wedding should be in between your home town and his home town. That's only fair to the both of you.|`|738cc40542d1484e903792ee2309e914aa	Is the location more important to him?   If it is then go with his home town. It's only 45 minutes apart.  Then maybe you could have a full say in another thing instead for example the decorations have them the way you want them..  In the middle would be ideal and fair for both sides.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	in the middle that way it's a common ground|`|tBODwcqXaa	Tough question. Maybe you should consider having it at the location that the two of you like best. (or is least expensive!) I would like to say do it in the middle but then everyone has to drive at least 20 minutes. Whatever you decide, remember that this day is about you and your guy! If people have to drive, that's ok. And if they don't want to, you don't want them there anyway! Good luck!

The best thing to do is to limit contact and avoid giving them any power at all over your life.|`|NkqslVrtaa	Family is Family- you have to suck it up and deal with it.

Pluczqoqaa	He introduces you as his wife????  He should earn that privilege, and he hasn't done it.  He wants the benefits without the commitment, and that doesn't cut it in my book.  It shouldn't for you either.    Money is an issue? That's a weak excuse.  There are many financial benefits that marriage has over being single.  Look at the tax tables in your Form 1040 instructions for an example.    Your BF is full of BS.  If he hasn't married you yet, I don't believe he intends to.  And don't settle for an engagement now either - you'll just be engaged and he'll continue to string you along.  Demand that he marry you now, or get out.  You're a sexy redhead, you can do better!!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If after 2 and 1/2 yr of living together and having a baby he hasn't ask you by now he never will.    He is keeping his options open hoping for someone better to come along.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I think the two of you rushed the relationship from the beginning.  You two moved in together after only dating for six months.  Did you discuss your future before you moved in.  What you expected from the relationship before hand or did you just arrive and the conclusion that you want to get married after you two moved in together and had a baby.  Then there is the fact that you are playing wife to him, so why should he have to go to the next step and make it official.  It could be that he is not ready to get married.  Both of you are still young. He may see all of his friends who are not married and still want to be like them.  You fight about the subject which says he may never be ready.  I can not tell you to stay or go, it just depends on what is more important to you.  Playing wife or being wife.  If you feel that you have waited long enough than leave, if you feel that playing wife is good enough or you feel in time he will change his mind then stay.  The decision is ultimately yours to make.  We are not in your relationship.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	if you have a good thing going, marriage might be the next step.   if you have a bad thing going why would you consider marriage at all?|`|jOyzcJd7aa	What's the rush in being married. Just cause you live together doesn't mean your prepared to be in a life time commitment. If he's not ready then so be it, some people don't get married till 9 years after dating. Just take some time and if you really can't wait for him then leave and find someone who is ready to marry you.|`|AA12029875	he hasn't married you because he does NOT want to be married to you. and why should he? that's the real ???|`|S5x6KNHraa	talk to your bf before u leave him|`|7kOba3H0aa	It exactly my story. I really don't push b/c I feel that a decision he has to make.
vSJIorF7aa	No offense, but I would never have accepted the invites to go with her husband. EVER.  Two issues.  One, he is not being with his wife (ever heard of renting a blippin movie?)  Two, she was probably testing him to see if he would go (which he did and that made her upset.)  Honestly, you probably should back off from both of them. She sounds unstable, to put you in that position doesn't make her a great friend, and a man that would leave his wife for another person makes him dirt and untrustworthy!!! You would be best to steer clear of both of them!!|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Um I would say stop being friends with them - it isn't healthy. Friendship is meant to be relaxing / calming / ENJOYABLE! Explain to her clearly that you are not interested in her husband and simply went to the cinema cos she suggested it - maybe wish her all the best and then say that you cannot remain friends with them because of this complication :(|`|7R8IPHXIaa	You were used for the test by the wife so she's regretting the fruit of it. Now just simply ignore them. Find someone else for sexual purposes.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	If I were you I would back waaaay off.  You don't have to declare yourself not friends with them anymore, but they're having some issues right now, and you don't need to get sucked into the drama.    Edited to add:  In light of the added information, run like the wind. Run away run away!  Hitting on you while accusing you of hitting on her husband is just tooo bizarre.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	it's best to stop being friends with her.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	That is the age old question isn't it. I do believe that there are situations were good people are pushed into cheating by the slow erosion of their marriage, or by some one that aggressively pursues them. Having said that I don't think that there is any justification for cheating. If you are in such an unhappy or miserable relationship that you want to cheat then those feelings should be your indication that you need to either work harder to rebuild your marriage, or you need to think about divorce.    I do believe in the theory that once a person cheats that it only becomes easier for them to choose that option again. The truth is that most people that cheat only get better at it over time.    In reality it is up to each couple to decide what goes down. I have known people that were devastated but that infidelity is the one thing that they can't accept.. I have seen adultery bring an abrupt end to a marriage. I also have good friends that were able to work through a husbands affair. He claimed to have had a single one night stand and he told his wife about it three days after it happened... they sought counseling and things have apparently healed over time.    I think though that it is important not to cloud infidelity and love. People that cheat do it for a million reasons and most of the time it has nothing to do with their spouse. Cheating has more to do with the insecurities of the cheater than it does anything else. Sure, a person can be unfaithful and still be in love with their spouce... A spouce can still be in love even when they kick the cheater to the curb. Most of us can't turn love on and off with a switch... but what it comes down to is forgiveness, and being sorry does not always mean that you are forgiven... that is why adultery hurts so bad... becasue someone you love the most devestates your world... and if someone does that then they don't deserve your love, no matter how they might feel about you.|`|HGfUY3lbaa	i dont like the idea of cheating but if you get cheated on he or she may or may not still love you some times people find things geting stall and they went to spice it up with some thing stupid like cheating|`|Dud46s2Daa	I think people are always going to be faced with temptations, it's overcoming them that is the hard part.  I guess I could see where they might hate themselves after they did it, but if they really cared, wouldn't they have resisted the temptation in the first place?|`|SPsE8Jtlaa	if someone cheats on you then obviously that person doesnt love you or care about your feelings... leave them... they are so not worth it you can do way better!!! once a cheater always a cheater!!!!|`|AA10772811	I dont 100% once a cheater always a cheater because I use to cheat and once I saw how I hurt someone I decided to change my ways and promised to never cheat on anyone else. BUT at the same time there are not a lot of people who think that way and stick to it. Because My boyfriend (ex) cheated on me once and kept doing it despite how much he saw me hurting and got the other woman preggers!!! I dont think its love when you cheat and hurt the other person.|`|agR89OPtaa	I suppose it could happen, but he wouldn't still be with me.  He would be telling that story to someone else.  Once a cheater always a cheater.  That is one thing I will NOT tolerate.  I don't cheat on him he better not cheat on me, or he will find himself at the curb with all his stuff.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If a person cheats then he/she truly doesn't love their spouse because if they did they wouldn't cheat on them or would want to put him/her thru that kind of pain and heartache.|`|bgWfcplBaa	I think they could really love you...but not really respect you.|`|c8m3gY8Aaa	If they cheat never let them back in your life you could get hurt.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Love is based on trust and faithfulness...how can you trust a guy/girl who cheats on  you? How can someone who cheats be faithful? I see cheaters as weaklings who have not really known the value and meaning of love.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	i think that depends on how many times it happens; if it happens once a person may feel horrible and REALLY learn their lesson and be more trustworthy in the future because they saw what happened the first time, but that doesnt mean that things will be ok between the two of you because that is really hard to forgive. Obviously something is VERY wrong if they cheated with you in the first place, so either they are just a total cheater or they dont love you enough to work through things; either way not good for you.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Nope. If I ever caught my fiancee cheating, he'd be out the door in less than 5 minutes.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	it could be a lapse in judgment, but generally I think they really don't care that much, if they cheated on you then they thought they should be with somebody else|`|KaAXJJo8aa	i despise cheaters ... love is a dedicated emotion. if they claim to be "dedicated" to you and is out there screwing someone else, it isn't love...|`|CFNozZM8aa	nope.  if they really, really loved you, then nobody else would compare.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	yes. but it depends on the circumstances and the person. there are deeper reasons to the act of cheating itself. but if you truly love someone you shouldn't cheat on them.|`|B12E4rYiaa	A cheater loves no one including themselves. When you cheat you usually have to plan it most people don't just have sex right when they meet so the cheater has to premeditate their actions.     When you cheat you hurt yourself and others it's a lose lose deal.|`|RVicFEyFaa	Yes I do. I think a "cheat' has many beds|`|Ne7xr36Saa	yep.  Some can't help themselves.....|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes he can cheat and still love you.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	nope  they can NEVER be trusted again, they do it once and are forgiven, then they can do it again and count on being forgiven.    i've been there had it happen, and i peaced out just to find out h cheated more than once.|`|6Oprylquaa	Once they do, they will again *unfortunately* :( They also tend to be untrustworthy in other aspects.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	no of course not|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Yes, but they dont actually care for your true feelings.  Becasue if they did they wouldnt cheat on you because they know how much it would hurt you|`|uEs7n7xgaa	yes, I'm a cheater who loves someone|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	No. They may LIKE you or love the IDEA of you, but it is the most shallow kind of "love" there is. If someone TRULY loves you, they will respect you. They will never do anything they know will hurt you. They will not take a chance of contracting a deadly disease or having a baby outside your relationship. They will cherish your body over all others. They will put your relationship before their primal desire. They will act like a rational, loving human being and not a retarded animal.|`|sR6vhbataa	Yes, but, I think cheating indicates there are significant problems in the relationship, or that the person lacks maturity. Or both.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Sure.     There is an old saying "love the one you're with".      Many cheaters do just that.    And when you are not doing anything for them they go off and find someone who will and love them while they are doing it.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	No the only person they love is themselves|`|UYCvwh6Paa	A cheater can still love the person they've cheated on.    Infidelity has more to do with feelings of being trapped, immediate gratification and self esteem issues, than it does a loss of affection.    Personally, I'd rather have a 2 sided, open relationship, than be trapped in a monogamous one.    At least in the open relationship you have an option, you're choosing who you're going home to each night instead of feeling chained to the person your obligated to go home to and you can never be made to feel like your the obligation.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	I have known people who cheated, and based on the explanations that I have heard, I think that it is possible that they love the person as a person, but are not actually "in love" with them anymore.    I have witnessed events in the lives of some friends in the past few years that initially just left me dumbfounded.    Based on what I have seen, I know beyond any doubt that at least 2 of the cheaters were really "in love" with the person they cheated with.  However, for financial reasons, medical reasons, potential child custody issues, etc, they elected to stay with their partners.      One has  since ended his marriage and moved on, and the other one has every intention of doing so as soon as his youngest graduates.        I have seen other situations where the cheater actually loves his wife and considers himself in love with her, but cheats on a regular basis, and feels completely justified.  I have seen a woman who claims to love her husband, but cheats constantly.    It is all confusing to me.  I don't see how people can live a lie, but I have seen circumstances that are heartbreaking, and while I don't condone it, I understand it.    Personally, I have trouble reconciling love with cheating, because as a couple of the other answers mentioned, in my view, love is about putting the needs and welfare and happiness of another first.  Ideally, when you love, your partner is doing the same in return.    Sadly, I think a lot of people get lost along the way.|`|1kfeghDDaa	I believe that someone can love you and cheat. In some cultures it's perfectly acceptable to cheat. I will go further to state that a person who cheats lacks character, no MATTER the culture as they would surly detest it if you cheated on them.   I can say that in a lot of cases once someone has strayed they realize what they can loose...such as in separations and begging for forgiveness for a year...and can change and not cheat again. Some still do and they should be left alone.  all in all it takes a real man to fore-go temptation.|`|Msu6RB1Qaa	No they can not really love you and cheat. If they really loved you they would be honest to you and their commitment and get an divorce, before seeking a new relationship or someone to have sex with. They have major character flaws. They always seem to have an "excuse", with the blame being someone else's fault. And only a fool uses the excuse its a man's thing, because it isn't or I was drunk or you have not been paying me enough attention, or you have gained weight, and etc.  I contend if you can not live by the commitment of marriage, then do not get married, and if you are married, divorce because you can not live by the commitment.  I have been known to fire a married employee, because they cheated. If they could cheat on someone they claimed to love, they surely would cheat me and the company if given the chance.    I have often said, if you have any doubts at all about getting married to someone, then don't.|`|7kOba3H0aa	It all depends on your situation. People can change. We all make mistakes and sometimes you must learn to forgive. The problem is you will never trust that person again b/c you will never forget. It all depends on the mutual love for each other and if the other person is willing to give that chance to move on.|`|iD4ejChZaa	No, when my [our] baby was one yr old my husband had an affair, he told me last year but it was years ago. Was he loving me when he kissed her with the same mouth that he kisses me with? did he pull down her panties? what was I doing when that took place? cooking? washing the kitchen floor?  was he loving me when they were in bed together? was he loving me when they made plans to be together or talked and laughed together? No, it takes time to cheat, it takes thought, even if the spouse doesn't know it is still sin, it is still lustful deceit, now 22 yrs later he told me he was with a hooker in the mideast, a person who really loves you does not cheat.|`|6627NijZaa	once a cheater always a cheater|`|F5gtYbDVaa	um.. no  they might 'say they do'  but we all know their lieing. c|:|`|6PaCUSzSaa	No because they are willing to choose to hut your feelings to have sex with this other person for no real gain...they are scumbags|`|273f4d8a2a7dc06d2adecfcbd9d31ba8aa	I think they can still love you, but in no way do they respect you or deserve you.

Sometimes people go through difficult times and they do things they normally wouldn't (cheat for example). When they come out of whatever "funk" they were in and realize what they've done, they can recommit themselves to you and show you the love that you deserve|`|AA10158192	If they really loved you why would they cheat??  I think they love the idea of you being there when it's convenient but  why would you want to stay with someone who can give you God only knows what in the way of disease.  yuck!  Not worth it to stick around, cheat on my once and I know, you can keep on going.|`|9KklyOcbaa	There is such a thing as a sex addict, but those people are seriously disturbed and need professional help. If he isn't a sex addict, then he doesn't have many morals when it comes to "love". If he told you, that's a pretty significant sign/hint that he doesn't care about whether or not he hurts you. If he didn't tell you, that means that besides the fact that he's a cheater, he's sneaky. Is this really someone you want to be with? If he's not willing to get help, you should walk away. If he is but he's not willing to change, you should walk away. You deserve better; you deserve to be with a guy who knows how to treat you the way he wants to be treated.

I think the best thing you can do right now is to just take some time away from him. If he's someone you see all the time this might be difficult, but I think it'll be worth it overall. Seeing him all the time is just going to cause you more pain and heartache. I'm not saying you should never talk to him again...just give yourself some distance so that thinking about him doesn't hurt quite as much. Try to give yourself a chance to get over him. Who knows? Maybe this relationship won't last long, and you'll get a chance to be with him in the future. For now, though, I think you should stop hanging out with/talking to him as much.|`|vfj4kyGIaa	It may sound stupid but the best thing you need is your friends and time, they are the most precious thing.

Why not try seeing what else is out there? There could be someone SO much better and you don't know it because you're stuck on him.  If you don't want to do that then try just being friends with him. Then if something happens between him and his current girlfriend he'll know that he has you to be there for him. He might even realize he likes you better!  Good Luck!!

KPXwwwMMaa	Copying you is the greatest form of flattery. She sounds like a little sister. She thinks you are really cool, and is trying to be as cool as you. It may help if you throw her a bone, and be nice to her. Give her dressing or make up tips. Make her feel like she is as cool as you, and she'll soon stop trying to copy you.     OR...    She knows it drives you nuts, so she intentionally does things to rile you up. Think... did you do something to make this girl mad? no? well, then she probably just thinks  you are cool, and is trying to emulate you.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	smack her she is not your friend..trust me and shes on your jock and she want's to be you lol..its true ma|`|ngLwXT23aa	i no how your feeling i have a friend like that to only instead of buying the same things a me, she just takes my clothes right out of my draws and then i cant find it for weeks, go 2 her house, and there she is wearing my clothes :(. tell her that its annoying and she should back off and get her own style or what ever. it didnt work 4 me but it might work for you
nCWjdyddaa	You may think you're his girlfriend, but you're definitely not.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	5 years and he hasn't told them either he is hiding some thing or his parents are mean . you should take that as a sign to leave because he has mom and dad issues he is a lost investment move on you deserve better you want a person that is close to their family's|`|35rFgcy6aa	He is definitely not ready for any kind of commitment... So, If you are then I would just say goodbye now!|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	Dump him, he should have introduced you, if he considered you as a part of his future, find someone who would LOVE to show you off, good luck hun!
7wumH6kDaa	Just talk. I would be your friend but i don't have many friends and i'm a little shy. but still just swallow everything and talk to someone.|`|AX3DQw3Paa	....I have no idea. I would say just be yourself, but the truth is, if you're going for friends, you need to fit a mold. If you're going for REAL friends, then by all means, be yourself. But..I'm not a good judge.     I would be your friend though, if it makes any difference. *hugs* I hope someone is able to help you sweetie.
rJTTdxeQaa	It's a phase. Truly just a phase. I went through it, and I regret it. Give it time. If a girl is still attracted to a man like that, then she is obviously not your type. But always be nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really, you have to ALWAYS be nice guy. The time will come if you always are a nice guy! Please remember that ok! LOL :)|`|O3Eu52LFaa	NO! only some girls like that. I HATE IT. I would dump a guys *** if he was a douche! Some girls just stay with their boyfriends that treat them like **** because they are scared to be alone which is some bs. I mean seriously no girl wants a guy that is rude to her!|`|UulMMhKRaa	they dont like being treated badly, & im sure you are a great guy, in a year or so youll be the ladies man, TRUST ME.|`|3UVPe2xraa	Hell, a boy better treat me right or im outta there! id punch the guy back!
0JLGGShnaa	although I can fall for a guy no matter what, I do have physical preferences.    I do not like skinny guys as much, I would prefer a guy with some meat on him any day! I like guys with muscle/meat and big frames. It's hot and manly to me|`|yrosG6qhaa	I like the chubby ones. If they're too skinny. . .well. . .it gets. . .annoying after a while.|`|1XtASkE1aa	i dont like completely scrawny guys, but i also dont like guys that weigh 8000 pounds. haha. i think you sound fine. it also depends on the personality.|`|3yoxsT9oaa	in between! but the personality is more important to me!|`|KOER1rJXaa	personally i cant stand skinny guys. I like to feel protected and prefer guys that are broad and have muscle. That with a decent personality goes a long way =]|`|6fXCNaQ5aa	def meat and muscle. what girl wants a guy thats skinnier than her?|`|ejrxNVD1aa	i like any type of guy rly i dont lyk for appearance i like them for their mind [=
pTsyBRWFaa	that is one sexy cat. 10/10!|`|yfGfuZ33aa	Don't ask her to be your girlfriend on Facebook or over the phone, but you should ask her to hang out sometime, or have your cousin set it up for you. After you hang out once or twice and she seems like she's into you, then ask her to be your girlfriend in person.
3ac2917fc4678a71d652bf51a6c677e4aa	It depends on how many chances there are to get hit on.  E.g. how many times are you out where men are.  I for example get horny screams every time I ride my bike at a road. And I can totally relate to the annoying truck drivers someone menitoned below- that was the worst experience for me, I was walking, exhausted and crying, and this truck driver keeps on hunking, flashing lights and yelling out the window- I guess the message is: you as a guy have to be sensitive about what situation/mood the girl is in.   But usually I agree, it is flattering to get hit on, even at work, if it is not overdone, just some nice compliments, but straight up mentioning sex would be too much for me and get me uncomfortable. But even that would not make me sue the guy (as it is frequently done), only in the event maybe that I was the one getting fired because of refusing to go for it. I got hit on by many key customers, important& attractive professors, gave me his cell, told me to call him when I got to the hotel, and he even kept asking my boss about me and if I was coming to this conference, so my boss knew and asked me about it and probably thought I was partaking. But I still thought it was flattering.|`|jOvC8Teqaa	I'd like to think I'm attractive but I guess it depends on how others see me. But I guess for the record I do get it on a lot.    But I'm pretty young so I enjoy the attention mostly when it's from older boys. When guys hit on me usualy it's pretty blunt and strait forward witch I like, and yeah I do get tired of being hit on soemtimes but that's only from annoying truck drivers.|`|bKxq02tTaa	yes, im like sooooo tireddd of it x). its likee sooo annoying, just like leave me alone u dont have a chance at this. sizzlee|`|kWbT63Ldaa	lol.    Well Im in the army and the female to male ratio is like 20/280 so....I get hit on alot. Pretty much on the regular.     They'll do things on the sly, try to get me to chill with them, ask me about my sex life, make excuses to come to my shop, and they turn everything i say into something sexual...lol.  I was even used as a bribe to do a turn-in on an illegal day because it was "civillian clothes day" and the guys at the SSA wanted to see me in civi's...hahaha its all in fun though, so I just shrug it off.|`|XlBew391aa	ive been told im pretty and have been 'hit on' when ive been out on the town, in clubs, coffee shops etcc...    its flattering, i have a long term boyfriend, so i never take it any further but yes, if its done the right way a girl will become flattered.    men come over and tell me im beautiful and/or pretty and it does get me flattered,   honestly most women can never tire of being paid attention,  it just gets annoying if the occasional dweeb just walks over and demands your number and then insults you when you decline    jasmine-marie   xo
3Te7aIx7aa	Hi,  I'm sorry you're going thru this.  I'm married and not divorced and hopefully won't ever be.   I believe in working it out - HOWEVER  - YOU are NOT wrong.  You're having strong feelings because it affects you so strongly.  Once parents are divorced, it's not a picnic either.  That status brings on a whole new list of battles between them.    It's ashamed as adults they can't work out problems more calmly.    You say your mom is the cause; I'm assuming (    No matter how this turns out - no, don't feel bad for wishing peace among the ones you love, no matter what that might mean.  Sadi|`|3183537bae9ffbed0dba26cc966cf357aa	I doubt you really want your parents to divorce - sounds like what you want is a happy family, without all the fighting and drama, and you're willing to accept whatever it takes to get it.  Divorce is no fun for anyone involved, including the kids.  Sounds like your parents really have some issues to work out - do they have any idea how much of an impact their fighting is having on you?  Pick the parent more likely to listen to you, have them take you out for coffee/ice cream, whatever, and TALK to them.  Explain how much this is bothering you, and see if there's anything they can do about it.  It may be that they're still together because they feel it's better for you or your siblings.  Children do better with 2 parents - but that's if the marriage is working, and it's obvious theirs isn't.  If they're not going to work at it and fix the problems causing the fights, then divorce may be the solution.    Like I said, it seems like all you're hoping for is a happy home, and there's nothing wrong with that - every child deserves it.|`|AA10346066	naw, you dont want them to divorce, cuz when you get married, your gonna have the biggest battle on the day of your wedding.     Youll go from little ms bride to .....o...shoot......how do i get out of here!?!..................
32e87706d642b217ca073e1e14c8bfa9aa	never forget that you are amazing :)|`|81a1a342f288e0d400e3b1dc8e300e28aa	Wow, you sound like an EXACT replica of me...|`|mCPMs7qsaa	you seem like such a sweet guy i would probably date you if i knew you!|`|OaxWErLraa	You're too young for me, but just thought I'd say good luck- one piece of advice, Dont go looking too hard. No desperately seeking- just be easy going and see what happens. :)
6528d0f69bf96d6695d5d2e5a7b14652aa	Yes. In fact at 201lbs and 5'6" you have a BMI of 28.8, you're not just fat, you're just short of obese (bmi 30+).    Even aside from being unattractive to men, there are plenty of health reasons you should think about losing some of that weight.|`|OaxWErLraa	Does your weight bother you? Then do something about it. If you are happy in your body, then dont change for anybody! If they dont like you for who you are, then move on.... someone will come along thats worth your time.|`|005a9dec26e573113e2eee596c25e980aa	I do not think that you should lose weight to attract men, but keep in shape to be healthy.  A size 12 doesn't sound extremely large.  You are obviously voluptuous.  Maybe you could trim down a little bit, but that is hard to say without really seeing you.  I would get myself to my doctor if I were you and get their opinion on your weight and size.  A physician will give you a good honest evaluation without trying to get anything out of you for it.|`|0dfde5bed81c3f7d176f4040974b4b24aa	you should first of all for your health then secondly guys|`|234f22a95d9389d9433e33d5728ec23aaa	Just work out a lil, man like all sizes of women but worrie about urself first like the girl on top said i agree, work out its fun wen u find the good motivation|`|12732763cb9e80926a8b8c61107b155aaa	why do u stress urself so much jus for men,, put in mind that some of us men like fat women so be proud of urself also this thing of workout u must becareful with it coz what happens is u do more body building than fat burning so in time u might find that u r short,fat  and stout then men wont look at u|`|74376b38afc59a65707042f8194fa1a3aa	There's nothing wrong with a women of your size.  Personally, I'm attracted to women that are larger than average.  I know that I'm not the only one that feels that way.|`|7ab43c98209854db2f4365b29564e4d6aa	yes|`|9cefb265f5e3c470cf7d758bd850d41eaa	You don't need to lose weight just to attract more men, but I think that you should lose weight on the account to become healthier. You don't have to lose weight for others, do it for the benefit of yourself.|`|4yZdpB66aa	honey, you need to love your self before anything else!! once you have the self confidence everything will fit in place. why are you going to loose wieght to attract men, thats a wrong reason...you need to do it because that is something you want near and dear to your heart.|`|6sMPfxVhaa	There is no way that your pant size is 12 if you are 201 and 5'6. My pant size is 12 and I weigh 155 and I'm 5'5. And second of all... stop hating your body. It's the only one you got. I know my two statements contradict each other but whatever. Point of the story... don't change your self for other people... and skinny girls are gross.|`|44af8fb8ee449a42350051d4072f333faa	Sadly yes you are.|`|23dcf2f726fbf17112409426eeac4322aa	yes,you're a little overweigh.To attract more guys and be healthier,you should try to lose weigh.Eat less meat and more fruits and vegetables,that's why most asian girls are slim.|`|39ff34a5c3eddbafa69a4e5395e92636aa	When and if you really want to lose weight to impress other you will in good time like every thing else... Until then, try you best to keep off the sugars... Sounds like you are married instead of single. LOL|`|Yy5cALljaa	you are what is considered overweight.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	I don't think attracting men is a good reason to lose weight. I think that if you're uncomfortable in your own skin or have health problems then sure, but changing yourself to find a man?   Nah uh. When you're ready, the right man will come along and you won't have to change a thing.|`|entNL1M8aa	thats how much i weigh..i am 6'4" though and a guy...you are one of those bbw's though...and i am not gonna lie to you ...that is kind of hot....you have a nice rack also...your pant size is not that big either...those **** must weigh 20 pounds...so you are now starting to look pretty good...i was just wondering if you have a nice bubble butt...lol...that would complete the package....you sound like a good catch|`|lJ7Bslgnaa	yes  unless you want to attract fat guys then no|`|AA12216669	Are you happy with yourself? If you are, then don't worry about it. Their are plenty of men that would think you look good. You have to be happy with yourself first. The rest will come naturally.|`|AA12069447	I am attracted to big women, nothing wrong with you babe, only it is bad for your health|`|AA11348086	You're the one that really needs to answer this. If you're comfortable with your weight and you are not having any health problems with it then you're just fine.    If you're not then you need to do something about. Cut down on junk food and go for long walks at the start and build yourself up to start jogging.|`|ac8802ee4683df91d0489f235cc3e928aa	Well how do you feel do you think you are to fat? That's all that matters. It is how you feel about your self.|`|Q9h0PScmaa	To me I don't think you need to lose weight to attract more men. If you want to lose weight, do it for yourself, and not for others. You'll be more satisfied that way. I love big girls, so I have no problem with them at all. In fact, they are a turn on for me. I hope things work out for you.|`|AA11585601	YOu are probably what people call a BBW.... you should check out a site called www.bbwluv.com and see how guys react to you there ! I'm betting you find a lot of guys who think you are PERFECT!    Best wishes
649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Well sweetie..i understand its hard for you to speak up and tell Ur parents that Ur going against their will and meeting your guy. probably your dad thinks you ain't old enough to date a guy, he is just being a protective and concerned father. well, i personally feel u should tell your parents about it coz they are undeniably our best friends and the only ones who help us when we are messed up with things.  if its hard to speak out to ur dad,  you can approach ur mom.   they might have reasons so as to tell u why they don't want you to meet the guy, do have patience to think about their views too and act wisely.  i hope things will be good as soon as possible.|`|AA10714599	i have almost the same situation with me. iam 16 and my boyfriend is 19.is like my parents don't want me to date so we just meet.sometimes saturdays at the mall or everyother day with them knowning. he pick me up to go school.i don;t have to tell them nothing.justbe with it unstill your parents thinks your old enought.me iam thinking still and 18.
8vyhc3sEaa	i dont know if i made a fool of myself but i certainly regretted it........ im used to keepin my feelings bottled up and for a long long time ive done fine.. but jus yest. an old friend called outta the blue and i was a lil drunk and i guess cause she was being so sweet i said all i felt......and after the high was over i hated myself for doin it............. i feel weak and lost and violated and i did it to myself so yeah i hate myself for havin done it.........just hope she has a bad memory and doesnt remember lol and no.. no romantic feelins involved... jus heard a friend and spilt my guts out.......... damn i suck !|`|xiTXPEoTaa	Yeah, I got drunk and had the misses' entire name tatooed on my chest. Unfortunately, my words were slurred and the artist wrote the wrong name on my chest.

760ccf35c3081a0b188817e21369e533aa	I hope you do not yet have deep feelings for her because you are being set up for a fall.  On the positive side, she did tell you this instead of leading you on.  She has to make up her own mind.  If she goes back to him it is a slap in the face to you.  Keep her as a friend or forget her.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	you want her to love her more and be all yours right! well, support her as she must be going through hell of stress as things have messed up with her ex. love her unconditionally, give her loads of attention and make her believe that u care for her and love her for what she is and no matter what u won't ever leave her... tell her you ll be with her no matter what and will always love her and now its just not words u really gotta push ur self and love her so much that she will love u and forget her past n start a new life with u.|`|0574fdee29d9d9c1d86afb9aae2fcda5aa	There is nothing you can do more. This is something she needs to figure out herself,but that was mean and rude of her to get involved with you before she totally got over her ex. Sounds like you are a rebound. Im sorry.|`|Vs5ymQQraa	why do you have to ask the same question over and over again?  she is not worth your time. She loves someone else, not you.|`|Sq2HZAc4aa	You dont need to do anthing because that is her problem, she have to make a choice between you and her ex, just do what you need to do for her and let her make the decision.|`|AA11222874	Honey, a little bit of "pressure" won't hurt her! It will make just good!  Tell her that you TRULY LOVE her, but if she doesn't appreciate this she will lose you forever!  Let her know that you are not the type of guy who accepts to divide a girl, you want her all for you, because you are giving your all to her!  I think that you should be a little bit indifferent to her, so that she understands she is losing you!   This is how human beings are: When you have smth you don't appreciate it, when you lose it, then it's when  you beg to have it back!!!!!!!!!!  Don't let her make  you suffer.   You deserve to be happy, and if she doesn't make up her mind...she is not worth your love dear!    Good luck!|`|d0ed1f0416ee001ff331ef296dec209daa	Hi,    i agree with rhea. U love her right? n u want to see her happy. let her give his ex a chance. now she has seen bot of u guys let her decide which 1 is god for. If she dosent do this now she will always hav a feeling that she missed the love of her 1st BF. I ur love for her is more that wat the other guy has then she is URS. The very fact that u allowing her to go back itself is a proof of ur love n care for her, n if she dosent come back ,then mate i wd consider her the most unlucky girl in this world.

I'm not really familiar with Hindu marriages, but if two people love each other and are both really willing to share that special moment of making love together, then they should do it when both feel comfortable. This could happen 2 months into a relationship with no engagement status, not until the wedding night, or even during engagement status .... it's a matter of if both of you are ready & truly love each other.|`|AA11656471	no do not do that wait till ur marriage  however show keen interst in her by all ways but withdraw

They are afraid of being humiliated and afraid of people not liking them, or saying the wrong thing, or people not accepting them- lots of reasons- basically they have low self esteem. This isnt just women though either, men are shy too.

On the other hand it seems that at one poinet he is angry at you and then the next he really likes you, although he is not known you that long to make any kind of assumptions, only whether or not he wants to date you and if he does then he will let you know if not then he will let you know that too.|`|qZ1lRAbqaa	dont let him do u like that push him away ignore him..........get someone better

My 14 year old Grand daughter got one from her friend & it reminds her of all the fun times they have had .|`|AA11258331	a day at the spa.|`|6d386bbaf94035e53b336b8d474d705faa	dude.. friends are like boxes. theyre empty inside. unless you give them something cool.. like the gift of loooooove. be consistant|`|AA11716110	hi nithya,  buy a set of lingeries. so whenever she wears she will remeber u. enjoy the life!|`|2ae8091654a8cdb32f1aebe328a5d1a2aa	u bake a cake not big only small n cute , then go to park with her and bring lemon juice with honey and bring paper cup 2 also dont forget to bring a small carpet coz u will eat the cake there and a candle dont forget coz u will sing a song b4 blow candle and b4 eating the cake|`|98d3297b4512ac4fd61d4da820b52758aa	depends what she likes - really give it some thought that is what i always do and eventually you will come up with something she will hopefully love but at least if you say well this is why I got it because you like this or that she will realise how much effort you put in and that will mean more than the gift itself|`|NN7qoycBaa	Hi.U have 2 choices.And without telling the first i suggest second that is,a rose with a letter summerizing ur whole feelings and ur heart|`|aw9e1F6aaa	you can give her something she likes of anything that comes from your heart::::::::::)

You can play a card game/board game for a while. On stressful weekday evenings, I usually make a romantic candle light dinner for my wife (I'm not the best cook in the world, but she appreciates the thought). Then we watch a "chick" flick with banana splits (or a desert of your choice (choc covered strawberries, etc..)).  Sometimes, you can play wrestle, burns a load of calories and is fun. One of the best...we clear a large area in the living room, turn the lights down low, play nice music and slow dance to our favorite music/songs....usually before the movie and after dinner on a Friday/Saturday night.  Best of luck.|`|y1GK6G8waa	play connect four, checkers, a card game, cook dinner together, watch a movie, discuss the news or a book.   play with each other, not sexual games.  be creative, leave the house and take a walk, go bowling, go play pool, go have dinner, a cup of coffee, enjoy each other.|`|w3LwrslPaa	TWISTER!!!|`|bb2ac295058742441278c0f488b54ae0aa	anything you would normally do with a friend - you guys need to figure this out on your own.

yhK3mAFZaa	Dont be  sad,instead think of coming to a solution.I think the only way to come out of the problem is to really know them.It is hard to understand if one is actually speaking the truth in the net but there's nothing more we can do.You can be rigid on choosing your friends.I know it sounds difficult and orthodox but its the only thing you can do.  Cheer up.I bet you have lots of good caring real friends,who never hurt your feelings instead give you lots of love.|`|Yvvwtpiqaa	Net friends are ok just for a chat if youre extremely bored. It is almost like you think they are really a friend but    1- You don't know them personally.   2- You don't know what crimes they have committed.   3- You don't know what they look like.    I put it this way. Make some real friends and stay away from net friends. Don't get all hurt over it because the chances are that you will never meet them in your lifetime. You have to be careful with netfriends, That's all im saying.|`|Wg3PPi9Vaa	net friends r there to confer u if u lose your real friends,,  but that hurt your feelings when they leave u alone|`|8vyhc3sEaa	some ppl have made ppl u meet on the net seem inhuman n not actual ppl ... why ?? yeah sure u have to be careful and safe but hey theyre all ppl....experiencin everythin any of us do....i guess some of us come on here cause our so called " real friends " let us down... so we come here and sometimes somone actually listens to us !hows that wrong? u have to know ur limits when ur talkin to someone online and be careful.... but dont forget we're all ppl.... even if we're jus connected through an online connection.....!ill jus say widen ur thoughts.... ur here... respect the genuine ppl here.....not all are assholes !
5b77077e70b84dab7414213e14225d32aa	This actually happened to me in late February this year!  Myself and a work colleague went for lunch in a food court in Melbourne CBD.  We sat down, and I noticed this girl at the next table.  There was something about  her that was different, but could not pick exactly what it was.   I noticed that she was also looking at me on occasions.  Anyway, we finished our lunch (whist exchanging occasional glances), and got up to leave.  She came up to me and said that she thought that she might have gone to primary school with me, and asked if I recognized her.  When I looked closely at her, I suddenly did, and recited her name. She was really impressed that I remembered, and quite excited, as we knew each other well in Primary School.  I was so shocked and surprised that I only asked her where she was now living, and whether she worked close by (she was on a training course). She had not changed  much from primary school, even though it was over 30 years ago.   For some reason, I suddenly became really shy and excused myself, and took off back to work.  Later I felt really bad about taking off like that, so I looked her up in the phone book, and fortunately her number was the only one there.   I rang her up, apologized,  and had a 40 minute chat about old times.  I must honestly say that it was a great deal of fun catching up, and certainly the best experience I've had this year. Was a really beautiful experience.|`|zGbq2OXtaa	I would probably feel horny baby yeah|`|c34ac433efa983d69ac5ef0833bbdbbeaa	I would certainly get excited her recognizing me after long. Of course, I would be comfortable chatting with her.|`|vRt0wndSaa	If she is a beautiful girl, I want to have no a reason in one's refusal to do and in this way many years she returns mark's back I, am rare|`|98b4278dc15566640965cbe8b35c56a1aa	Sure I'd be comfortable. Especially if she used to be a fatty and was now a hottie.Actually , it wouldn't be comfortable the other way. If she used to be cute and had turned rancid, what would you say? "Have you seen any other of our classmates, or did you EAT them!"|`|zqJYGQRHaa	Id feel damn comfy and nice|`|AA10127478	No, I shall not describe my feeling as strange but a mixture of pleasure and surprise.  After the initial shock, I hope we will get down to  chatting.  Oh!  we would be having so many things to chat!  Once we used to share some common feelings, some common moments, some common activities and so many things.  Maybe, because we are adult now, our chatting will be on a more mature level, but the internecine emotions will be there.  How I wish I could get back to those days!
DCfaVj6Daa	May be he is waiting fou to take the first step (since he is shy kinda person).  why dont you gather some courage and call him.  this will surely sort out the problem|`|5PDPJMlYaa	i was gonna help you. i read the first line and stopped    simply because you typed "skewl"    k bye|`|QR9UUCY2aa	umm yea just talk to him. if you like him that much ask him out. or is that still like sumthin girs dont do...hmm my new question. lol
AA12120127	She is probably thinking the very same thing as you! If you don`t ask her you will never know, never knowing is far worse than her saying thats she just wants you as a friend. Life is too short to leave things unsaid. Just be prepared for is she says no. Good Luck!|`|AA10815255	talk to her....open up...hope  for the best..........you won't know if you don't ask/try|`|TjO9mPhnaa	just ask her  forget that she consider you as a brother|`|Yx3zqQIZaa	If she said that there's no hope for you dude!    move on|`|c9648b8240f8879e345787c4d857eb39aa	Well I would have to say that a lot of guys who are friends with a girl and like them more go through this problem.  You should start by doing more than just friend type things.  You should start making her like you more but don't rush in.  If she starts to back a way wait longer she might not ever like you as a b/f but being friends is good because maybe someday she will like you.|`|So8Zx11Yaa	be the best best brother as possible . . .|`|rBKTF2ivaa	Nope, You might do things my brother does, but honey, you are much too cute to be him.|`|nMqbfmTCaa	in what way does she like you? if your like abrither to her you should be able to talk to her about it openly im sure she will respond nicely! x|`|v8CattyLaa	well thats hard got up to her and she what she really thinks of you dont be shy and if you never try you mite miss out one a once in a life time thing xxx ps go with your haert if you think she likes you already then take her out somewhere nice xxx
AA12285514	Your husband shouldn't be mad at you because you have a close relationshi[ with your parents. Your a grown women and it's important for you to be with your family. Even though he get's mad just ignore it. He probably is just jelous because your parents are getting more attention then he is.    Don't sweat it. If he keeps acting like that then you need to do something about it.|`|f4d09d110d8b4376fb07f932aa6a7373aa	Its not right for him to keep being mad he just has to understand that you are close. It sounds like he is more so mad because everytime you wasnt happy with anything you most likely called your parents and he felt as though it just gave him a bad name and he probably feels as though the reason you almost left him was because of your parents. Nobody really said marriage is easy but you have to make the best out of things like this and you have to communicate with him more often. Good Luck|`|0feaf1c170a2a2045c5bed92a8955002aa	He has no right to get mad because you are close to your family, he is just trying to control you, don't let him|`|e3cf6cb26847c69d90770c32ab0f3706aa	Well, I don't believe your description is all well and honest. But, let me tell you this: Even if you were right it wouldn't make you happy... and in this case you're not! Why? Because your man is your family. You chose to make him family and you owe him that love and respect. He feels degraded in your parent's eyes becasue of all the negative that was relayed to them in the past. Honey, men are simple. If you make it your business to love him like you've never been hurt it will reciprocate 10-fold. You will benefit. It's a win-win situation. Don' trust me. Try it yourself starting tonight. Be compassionate, be sweet, be kind, be inviting, be loving and be very sexy. A good orgasm never hurt anyone ;) After a while, if you keep this attitude you'll find your husband isn't mad anymore when you "talk" to your parents... Good Luck!|`|4300cdcf8ac3338c2ba680b9cdd1dc4daa	NO he shouldn't be mad that you are close to your parents, my husband and I have been married for 6 years now and I am still and always will be daddy's little girl :), but now that you are married, he may want you to rely on him now to be there for you.  My husband and I have a great relationship, we share all of our secrets and dreams, and sharing those with your parents is fine, but you are married now, he is asking you to trust and believe in him.  Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't call and talk to your parents, it is wonderful that you have such a great bond with them, but you are a married woman now.  Unless your husband is treating you hostilly (such as physical or mental abuse), lean on him now for your dreams, it may be a scary ride to let go of telling your parents everything, but believe me, when you are with a man, whom can love you more than he loves himself, it will be a great and wonderful ride. I wish you both the best.....:)|`|zUuG4JfLaa	no ur husband shouldnt be mad at u for being close to ur family at all seems as if he's jealous because u have someone else in ur life that ur close to and he's not the only one in his life some men want and need to be the center of their wifes world and cant deal with it anyother way i'd tell him nicely that u will always be close to ur family and he might as well get use to it|`|hsWwE9EKaa	You just ruined your husbands thoughts about your parents,when you tell your parent about your marriage problems instead of talking to your husband that makes your husband feel like your just talk crap about him to your parents.     Parents don't forget! so they will always look at him like trash because thats all you ever tell them about your husband.  That in return will cause your parents to convence you to leave him and tell you how he isn't right for you.      You dont ever talk to your parents about your marriage fueds it childish and your an adult you don't need your parents judgement , you need to talk to your husband who you promised to love and charish for the rest of your life!  Remember nobody else made that promise to devote his life to you and your needs. Take care of it together or go to a marriage counsler they will do wonders for a troubled marriage.    take care!|`|25ca35a28102b28e2c5c94f6fd4e0ec1aa	He shouldnt be mad but u do have to respect the boundries of yall being married and puttin your family in everything yall go though. Sit down with him and figure out WHAT exactly about you and your family being SO close bothers him then see what you could change about that

a4a76159abccfc5bb0d096c9d7fcbef3aa	willing to look past that???? Kids are the most important people in a person's life. No one can love anyone as much as they CAN love their kids. Most people do love their kids. First things first, accept the kids as your children. It's not even worth it if you can't. You need to bond with them before you bond with her. If you don't they will either hate the fact she is dating some random guy who will 'never be their father' or you will not be able to accept and love them like your own in the long run. Be the 'cool guy' and let them eat some ice cream. There is only pure joy in kids. Nothing to need to 'overlook'. And believe me, your relationship will blossom. She will know.    Also, don't listen to the one above mine. Don't call her every day, chicks hate clingy guys.|`|9650df2878c3ba707bbfdb260baeda38aa	keep on pursuing her..call her everyday, ask her out.. get her attention..slowly tell her u like her..|`|61ac7b738ce0c77ea7900875057a3759aa	What do you mean by 'looking past that'. Her having four kids? You would need to tell me and show me more before I would give you my love and share my life with you. These are children who need a dad, not a live in boyfriend. They are part of the package, not an attachment.

Wait and see what the next one says.|`|WJ6ENl5Laa	i think you need to talk straight up and figure it out with him rather than asking all these people to interpret what he might mean. men work in funny ways sometimes and i think that things would be alot easier if women just came right out in the open with  us and asked what they want to know. just be straight. good luck... we can be confusing.|`|wqPopRyMaa	I bet he was in a hurry and forgot the S.

I do have a few, for my kids sake, but they are not displayed.  No one has ever told me I am pretty.  And when I hear it all around me, but never to me, it starts to play on your self esteem a little bit.|`|997976fe43cc5dde2da634886b464cabaa	Well why were you taking a picture of your bud's wife.  did she not want your BUD, aka: her husband to see her in a picture that he does not know about, or what!?|`|c3ec55da2bf8d3db8268054b9ad6b8bfaa	I'm one of those girls who hides their face while someone tries to take their picture. Truth is, I hate having my picture taken, because I don't take good pictures. I only have my picture taken if it's absolutely necessary (and I can't get out of it).    But in your friend's wife's case, maybe there's another reason why she doesn't let you take her picture. You said she didn't provide a quality answer, so maybe you could ask her to elaborate on it. If she clams up, let it go, and respect her opinion (and privacy). But if she does explain her reason more clearly, try to see it from her perspective. People may not always want to explain why they think a certain way, so when that happens, don't press them any further.|`|Tu092LRzaa	If I looked like crap that day, I wouldn't want a camera in my face at all.  It's code for "you caught me on a bad day. Take my picture when I'm looking great."

The only thing I would say, which is what I said to her, is you are there to get help and support in putting your life in order and getting involved in the opposite sex is about the worst thing you can be doing.  concentrate on yourself and leave the boys alone for a while.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	What do you want help with exactly,spelling or writing a story ?  Grow up and maybe your love life will be better...|`|AA12395564	You sound very young - and certainly too young to be sleeping around " to get what your boyfriend isn`t giving you ".  ( what exactly is that....? sex....? attention....? compliments.....? ) I hope you were using protection  against pregnancy and infection ? Look - learn from this, move on, and never do it again. If you don`t have respect for yourself, no-one else will. You`ve cheated on your boyfriend and you`ve been used by this other lad. One has no respect for you cos he`s used you and the other has no respect for you cos you have none for yourself. Getting your boyfriend back will only make things worse - you`ll argue over what you did all the time. Now just draw a line under it and make a fresh start - a new you - respectable and trustworthy. And remember - you don`t need sex that bad - there are other more important things for you to be thinking about at your age - like making a future for yourself. Now go and do it and forget about these 2.|`|e0ee07fd300f958dd61a023a965c832caa	you ho.|`|9f87c8a92289b4d29480e289a2689d90aa	You sound a bit young and with out meaning to be rude a little messed up.

Anyway good luck, and I hope things work out for you in the longer term|`|57471e94b3efe128608aeabf06155361aa	That's a really unique spelling of 'started' - sratrted.

T2tbwVgvaa	yes, if you like him tell him!!!  He probably likes you if he is making the effort to sit next to you and asking questions that he could ask any other person.     If you aren't sure if he likes you as more than friends, here is a way that you can do to find out...    Depending on what kind of guy he is this should work...the next time both of you are sitting together make sure that you sit on the other side of the table facing him.  When there is a break in the conversation (sometimes akward silences aren't a bad thing if you can take advantage of them) when he looks at you...look him straight in the eye and smile. Not a friendly smile that you give to everyone but a smile that lets him know that you have feeling for him.    If he likes you then he should smile back and maybe do other things that shows he likes you also, such as things like starting to play with things on the table or anything else that might show that he is nervous.    If he does not show any signs after your smile he is either not interested, a jerk, has no personality, or is completly oblivious to your "Hint."    Tell him you like him...if you do. The worst that can happen is that he tells you that he doesn't like you in that way|`|54cdcbb3751b213063044854ce00374baa	i dont get it...so what if he sat with you?|`|vf5X1Gm3aa	It sounds like he likes you...

What she decides to do is up to her but being honest is your best bet. Sure your relationship is worth giving another try, but it depends on how she feels about what you did with her friend. Then you know whether to move and try to make things work out , but that depends on what she says.
jZfb3pifaa	Tell her that you've been thinking about your relationship lately and you don't think it feels right. THEN, be honest with her, and tell her that you can't lie to her because you are starting to have feelings for someone else. If she's mature, she won't freak out, and will be glad you were honest with her.|`|3566188061f294a16807056333d8ef6caa	I think you should be completely honest.  Let her know that you don't feel the same way she does and that you think it is best that you are friends instead.

SqrPpm5Daa	Sit down with them and make them work it out.  It really is going to mean that they both need to compromise but they'll learn more from the situation if they have to work that out themselves.

Sh eis 12, this is a bad time for her to start shutting herself off, she will do enough of that in the next 6 years already.  I know I am blunt, but you asked because you wanted an answer.

Eventually, the two of you will be spending more time together. As for the flirting, what she doesn't like is complete jerks making useless small talk with her or making comments about her butt!

When I am feeling insecure in a room full of beautiful size 2's, I just keep repeating in my head "I'm the prettiest girl in the room, these girls ain't got nothin' on me" you have to psyche yourself up. Also, taking baby steps every day will help. That guy you want to talk to but are afraid of? Say hi. one simple word can do wonders. When you are talking about telling people how you feel do you mean telling people about your body issues? I personally wouldn't do that because most people take that as complaining and it's a turn off when trying to be more outgoing. Try joining more clubs that you are interested in because the people there have your same interests as well.    One more important tip that REALLY helped me once I started to believe it: People are more concerned with their own flaws and their own hang ups than with yours.    take comfort in that when you are talking to someone new and it will get easier in time believe me!|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	There's nothing wrong with your body.

AA10022566	I made my own invitations, and I wrote in the invitee's name on the response card.  We had a venue with limited seating and I figured by writing their names it might prevent people from bringing extra guests that weren't invited.  It worked; only one person brought someone extra that wasn't invited.    Since you made your own invitations, I would say go ahead and enclose another card about the weather.  You can make it coordinate with the invites.  I think "weather permitting, ceremony will be held outdoors" is enough, you probably don't have to tell people to dress accordingly.|`|AA12054566	William apparently doesn't get out much.... or invite anywhere.      You don't need to write anything on the response card- people will do that for you. Just the outside envelope!

I like the fact your giving people that information- I once wore 4" spiked heels to an outside wedding-- real fun!!

If they don't care, why in the Hell are they answering questions? sorry for my language. (saying this about William) And when it comes to a wedding, little details, if not paid attention to, can become big problems later. So you are right in asking a question like this. as to your first question, you can do it anyway you deem necessary. But something to think about is what if you send out these response cards, and you have written out the names of each, what about if you missed someone? for example, you send the invitation to Mr. & Mrs. John Smith, but you accidentally forget to put down their children; Bob, Charlie, and Suzy? I am just saying, that if you want to write out exactly who it is for, just make sure you write down everyone's names. And as to the second question, since you don't have room on the invitations, you can put it on a separate paper. But may I suggest putting it on printable business cards? it'll look better and it won't look like you just wrote it on a scap piece of paper that you threw into the invitation at the last minute. I hope all this helps you. I am planning a wedding myself (07-07-07) and it's a lot of work. I hope you have a wonder time on your special day. Congrats!!|`|a3e11f9fab12e9c7b5ac773d2818a3d3aa	The line on the response card is so they know who's coming.  You may invite multiple people from a house, but the response card is when you find out which of those people is actually comming.  Also, if you invited someone and a guest they might right their guest's name on the card when they send it back.

Here are some ideas:    1. If you're at school, you can say you "forgot" what a step was in solving a certain Math problem or something...?  2. You can just simply smile and say "hey" or "hi" and then say "I don't believe weve met, my name is_____" and then say "It's nice to meet you."   3. You can tell a joke  4. You could even ask a question, that is legit of course.  5. You can have some friends introduce you to this person.  6. You can use cheesy pick up lines...(not likely to work though.)    **Just be  yourself and be casual about it, you'll be fine.

Adems, la testosterona (la mujer tambin la tiene) es mayor en hombres que en mujeres. Esta hormona regula el apetito sexual.  3) El hombre siempre es frtil. La mujer no.    Estos tres motivos hacen del Hombre un ser muy sexual. De todos modos, no todos somos unos obsesos. Pensa?os mucho en sexo, pero si no tuviesemos autocontrol acabaramos locos. Pensar en ftbol es un buen antdoto.    Nota curiosa: Muchas mujeres con gran apetito sexual suelen tener un clitorix ms grande que la media, es decir, ms testosterona.

Todos estaramos obsesionados si no tuviesemos sexo a menudo.  El sexo, al producirnos placer, una vez que se prueba, y se disfruta, nos hace dependientes de l como del azucar.  Si no se practica de vez en cuando, el cuerpo nos lo pide.  La naturaleza nos di para que la especie se reproduzca:  Al hombre mas testosterona, por lo que puede sentir mas necesidad de tener sexo, debido a sus hormonas .   A la mujer el instinto maternal y la llamada del reloj biolgico, por eso solemos ver el sexo de una forma distinta a ellos.   Tanto las mujeres como los hombres que llevan una vida sexual activa y satisfactoria, no se obsesionan por el sexo, piensan en l de una forma normal.  De hecho yo pienso mas en el sexo que mi pareja.

Cuando se ama a alguien se acepta con todo y todo y es una forma de relacin mas profunda que se comparte y demuestra lo importante que es esa persona. adems un hijo es lo mas hermoso que hay y no tiene por que ser de uno para amarlo por que padres son los que cran no nada mas los que se traen al mundo el que le da cari?o amor con le que se pasa tiempo compartiendo juegos no pierdas esa oportunidad.

Yo estoy por casarme con mi novio, a quien conoc por internet igual que t. A mi novio lo conoc en un chat de AOL, y realmente lo que estaba era molestando a los chicos. Eso ocurri en mayo del 2005. Nunca me imagin que me enamorara de esta manera, era un imposible!!! El es un boricua que vive en Pennsylvania y yo en Puerto Rico. Yo tengo 31, y l 28, as que los dos somos jvenes an y yo no poda ver lo que l haca, ni l a m, as que tuvimos que hacer un pacto de suma importancia para que nuestra relacin continuara, y era la confianza. Desde que me divorci, he tenido demasiados pretendientes, y hasta a veces, cuando iba camino a mi trabajo y estaba hablando con mi novio por mi celular, l escuchaba cuando los hombres en la calle me lanzaban piropos. Eso era difcil para l, y para m, pues no saba a ciencia cierta qu pensaba de m, como " debo olvidarla, tiene hombres detrs de ella y fcil ella se busque otro para divertirse." Tuvimos que hacer planes: l trabajaba de 3pm a 11pm, pues esperaba su llamada a las 11:15pm y nos quedbamos hablando hasta casi al amanecer. Lo dejaba descanzar hasta la 1 o 2pm, y lo llamaba. Nos dejbamos mltiples mensajes de texto, y nos llambamos, aunque sea por segundos durante las horas de trabajo, para decirnos un te amo, etc. Le envi cartas con fotos, un video con contenido 'no apto para ni?os', lol, claro, para que se entretenga y me desee ms. As estuvimos por los primeros 8 meses, hasta que me fui a verlo, un viaje relmpago, un fin de semana, de viernes a lunes. Recuerdo muy bien a fecha, el pasado 13 de enero, 2006. Jams me arrepiento de ese viaje, nos esbaratamos del tanto esperar ese momento, y todava me emociono al recordarlo.Delante de su familia me propuso matrimonio, y acept. Me cost dejarlo cuando me regres, y ese hombre no paraba de llamarme, cada vez era ms el amor que nos tuvimos, hasta que hize planes despus de ese viaje para irme a vivir con l. Dej mi casa, y mi Puerto Rico, y me fui a Pennsylvania el pasado mes de junio, 2006. Ya ha pasado casi un a?o, y actualmente vivo con l, y muy pronto me casar, ya estamos en planes de comprar casa, y me siento la mujer ms felz de este planeta. Cabe destacar que tengo 4 hijos de entre 6-11 a?os de edad, y nunca viv fuera de Puerto Rico. Nos compenetramos super bien, y creo que esto obedece a que siempre nos comunicamos, nunca nos rendimos, siempre confibamos el uno al otro, y nos decamos que este amor era puro, que no lo podemos dejar de morir, porque amar como nos amamos ya casi ni se ve. Me siento super afortunada y felz con lo que estoy viviendo, y ojal muy pronto te pase a ti lo mismo que a   m. Nunca te rindas, mala, habla muchsimo con ella, mndense fotos, hagan planes para verse, o mejor an, que busquen la manera como hacer la vida por fn juntos, y que este amor siga brillando como brilla el mo. Ojal todo te salga bien, y te deseo la mejor de las suertes....|`|IXZW0etoaa	claro que puede enamorarse asi de facil alguien, todo depende de que tanto esta persona habra su mente y su corazon.    por lo regular quienes hacen esto son personas muy sensibles o timidas,    yo en lo personal tube un noviasgo por internet, a quien yo veia como una gran persona en quien podia confiar, y charlar.    mas cuando nos conocimos en persona (y vaya que fue algo increible ya que cuando nos conocimos yo estaba en los angeles, California USA, y ella en Kakegawa, Japon), fue diferente, ahi deveras surgio el amor, cosa que antes de que nos conocieramos fisicamente no habia pasado    mas sin embargo hay gente que si se ha enamorado realmente de gente que ni sabe realmente como es|`|agpK6X2Naa	Disculpa pero me parece que tu relacin con ella es pura fantasa, no puede ser real ya que no la conoces personalmente.

To answer your question....do you think the boys in your school would like to have a gf that 5 others had before? Maybe not.

And work on talking in a way where you don't have to worry about who hears it, or what your little bro will say about it.|`|e90oXWlzaa	do wat kitz said|`|8926df5af8e7cec717561d7fcd237c90aa	I think you like this girl! That's cute that she gets along with your little brother. But the best thing to do is just talk to her about it. Apologize for fighting and tell her you miss being her friend, that's all.

People gossip about only a very small percentage of people. The popular kids and the really freakin' weird kids. Most other people are pretty much ignored.

Do not act. You will regret it if you confront anyone now. Calm down and BREATHE. Lay down and keep typing. Open up a word document and write down everything you are thinking.

I dont know what time it is there, but take a walk or go to sleep, but do not talk to anyone right now.

Jealousy is a disease get well soon haters..  **********    Alright sweetness, listen up.    NO ONE, should ever have the right to make you feel this horrible inside.  Nor should you allow the satisfaction of their evil ways to penetrate your soul like that.    People who say things to others that are hateful or cruel, or just plain unfathomable, are misrible people with misreable lives.    For someone, with no reason at all but envy, to say hateful things like that deserve the worst life, and that is what they have, hence why they get under your skin.    Don't make yourself an easy target.     Even if your burning inside, don't give them the satisfaction of a hint of emotion.    No one deserves your precious emotion, unless YOU want them to. You decide this.    Let them live their awful ugly lives in their own little hell.    Laugh to yourself...laugh at them. Tell them that you would feel sorry for them but the only problem is you can't because you feel nothing towards them.    Let them suffer in their own hate filled world, while you enjoy your life, while you treasure your life, while you live your life.    Keep your head up honey, don't ever look down. Looking down gives you a disadvantage.     You can't break something if its too high too knock down.    Good luck love. :)

Why is it hard?|`|fyyzKKqpaa	Two ways:  kind of grasp her pal with your thumb and she'll hold yours with her thumb  Or interlace your fingers    You can practice on yourself with your hands if you're eally worried    But it should just come.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	gently, and not sweaty. it always hurts for one person, make sure its you so she thinks you are nice. wrap your hand around hers and be sweet. good luck :)|`|AA11441704	ha..ha.. let her hold you then.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	What kind of question is this? Did you ever hold hands in kindergarten? Or when you were 5 and your parents held your hand? It's the same thing. There's no special technique. Don't crush her fingers.|`|TuyFcb5qaa	umm... just do it slowly and maybe surprise her one day by showing up next to her and softly hold her hand (she would love that). It's easy but then again it's alot to think about. maybe intertwine fingers?|`|llez7aU4aa	Seriously, I had this same problem. If you ask people's advice you will get all sorts of stupid crap and everyone will have something different. I eventually just went for it and guess what, she didn't like it because my hands were cold. It was winter in my defense ha ha. You need to just go for it and don't do anything weird. Either do the normal fingers together soft grab or if you are ambitious try the interlocking fingers. They are both easy and will work. Remember to warm your hands first!|`|q2POh1dEaa	me neither!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Did you ever hold hands with your mom?  ......If so...um...I believe it is no different.

I think you would have better luck with these brands instead of a replica. Reproductions can even get expensive sometimes. I just bought a sample Anjolique style 936 dress for $399. Bridal stores normally sell their sample dresses twice a year, March & November ish. Once a designer stops making a style there's no need for the sample. You might even get to have your Priscilla of Boston dress. I know someone who waited and got one for $500. Go to their website and sign up for their emails. They'll notify you of great promos including sample dress sales.    Ethics: Don't get a dress from China. It's horrible how they treat them and underpay.

LZK4TqTAaa	He is immature and having troubles committing. I'm not too sure why he married and had children feeling the way he does (trapped, etc). He does not seem to respect you, nor do his actions. He lies, and clearly does not want to be married. He wants to have someone to be physical with but wants none of the responsibilities of a relationship. He really should've thought about this before having 3 children...(if the first BC method didn't work, HE could've taken extra precautions to avoid another pregnancy)  There is nothing you can do at this point to stop him. If the marriage is over, if you two do not want to try counceling, then all you can do is file for divorce and end the relationship so he can do what he wants without hurting you and the children.|`|bgWfcplBaa	Run girl, RUN!|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Follow your instinct.

With all that you have said it is up to you on whether or not to continue to put up with this relationship.  You are only going through what you are allowing him to put you thru.  Only you can make you happy.  A man cant make you happy he can only contribute to your happiness.     Think about you and your kids and what will make you happy.  He will do whatever he wants to do if its stay with you, then he will if not, he will separate form you for a 5TH time!!!|`|B12E4rYiaa	You two really need some marital counseling if you want this to work otherwise it's time to be done with it. The pattern is going on and on with no end in sight. If he won't go then you need to go for yourself and for the sake of the kids. This relationship won't get any better until you have professional help someone with wisdom to guide you so that your marriage can get on the right track.|`|AA11313204	cut ties with him. dont sleep with him. you cant afford him getting some disease and spreading it to you. once you have decided to stop sleeping with him you will find it easier to stop worrying about who else hes sleeping with.|`|AA11391968	He sounds like he is unsure about whether he wants to remain married.  Therefore, he is reaching out to the ex.  I think you should separate and do alot of soul searching for yourself and your children. Then make decisions when you are ready.  What the two of you have been doing does not sound like it's working.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi makoto, 4 times separated, 5 kids, 6 yrs married and 7 yrs 2gether.  WOW, this should be appreciated and cherished.  I see that ur husband looks for FREEDOM and says he feeling trapped.  So, ask him what kind of freedom that he's looking for ?  for he had 5 kids to care for.  What about YOUR freedom ?  free from worries, free from financial, free from caring for your kids and   free from thousands of other things.    But ULTIMATELY, now, is about YOU or HIM ?  And if love is still in the context, then why not sit down and talk things over.  And everything is about compromise and if both of you couldn't tolerate it any  longer, then I suppose this marriage nothing will come out of it.    And finally, if your husband really wants the cake and eat it too, then I  think nothing much can be done.
mD4Xn3jNaa	I go with OPC's answer|`|GeHxekEMaa	AVOID HIM|`|PtqOvLtOaa	just tell him the truth. whatever that may be. if it's that you aren't ready tell him that. honesty always works best|`|1hlIzEnTaa	lol  3 made me giggle,  you could also try,   I CAN'T!.. My dad's a bodybuilder... hehe   but no, just say you're not looking for a relationship right now, nothing against him, or say you're sort of seeing somebody else and arent sure where thats going to go :)|`|vfj4kyGIaa	Just say that your not emotionally ready for a relationship yet. Just say I'd love to be friends. But stick to that.|`|6Oprylquaa	Honesty is usually the best policy, specially if he is a friend. If he's a stranger tell him your not interested in dating anyone right now but that it's very flattering. And that he should keep trying that eventually he will find the right girl (not you lol).|`|1b14bdc1f90929e1a3af77ba5c63bce3aa	sorry my life's to complicated right now  ...hope you understand|`|H6gjOGnGaa	Is there a reason you're going to say no but can't tell him the honest reason for saying no?  I assume there is, but you don't want to get into it here.    I wouldn't tell him that you like him, because that would be a mixed message.  It won't be absolutely clear how to take it, and what you want is clarity.  Simply tell him that you are not interested in pursuing a relationship with him at this time (or better, that you are not interested in a relationship with him - though this will probably close off that possibility in the future too.)    Remember, telling him no as clearly as possible saves both you and him a lot of time!|`|cmFU81rQaa	First, unless you have dudes lining up around the block, why would you say no to a chap who likes you who you kinda like back.  You don't have to be in love with someone to go on a date with them.  Sounds like you'd both enjoy it.    Anyway, that aside, please be honest.  As a guy, when I make myself vulnerable and ask a lady, I want as straight an answer as the question.  As a teen growing up, I trusted people at their words' face value, and ended up getting hurt because girls who rejected me wouldn't just tell me no no matter how I asked them to.  They repeatedly made excuses which I often naively thought were genuine.    Especially if he likes you a lot, he deserves to know the plain truth.  He's putting himself out there, and if you're going to tell him 'no, it's the timing,' he might, like me, like the girls he asks enough to wait and ask again when you're 'ready.'    Please, for everyone's sake, don't lie.  Just tell the truth.  Most girls can't.|`|puBK0gEXaa	just tell him you are talking to someone.... works for me all the time im a guy LOL|`|SbsB0bwEaa	1 or 2 not 3|`|ZYOwcdVcaa	U 'kinda like him'. U are cold, but whatever, just tell him 'no', that u like him just as friends. Why do u fear a relationship? is my question for u. If u can answer that, u can answer this question.    Answer mine?  First question under my profile titled "How to get this girl to like me?"|`|D0MxY6eoaa	WOW i am just happy to hear i am not the only one going through this!  i had to pull the old  " i dont want to lead you on, but i am leaving for college soon and i dont want to start something that i cant follow through on"    and " i would feel horrible if i led you on for a long tim e just to break your heart"   i had to end things with this guy tonight hahah good timing|`|rE3CqHupaa	Just tell him you want to be friends right now see what happens in the future|`|O716Z3HRaa	The truth hurts, that's why most girls don't flat out tell the guy. I think, to spare his feelings, tell him you're not ready for a relationship yet or that you like someone else, or if you want to flat out tell him, then be like I only see you as a friend, nothing more. I'm just curious, if you like him, why no?|`|CFNozZM8aa	Tell him you recently had tremendous brain trauma and have no clue who he is.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i have aids soooo yeah|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Haha...you should tell him you're into chicks.    Or say you're a ghost, that one always works.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	Hmmm. Let him know you still want to be around him. If you think it might become something more, let him know you just need time. If he really likes you and wants to be with you he will understand.  if you don't like that then:  4. I'm joining a convent  5. I am not allowed, after the last time  6. Stalker ex would shoot you/him  7. I'm dying|`|o4LBt2QVaa	1. im really sorry. your a nice guy and all but i just want to stay friends.  2. look...im taken. sorry.   3. you know what....*sing the hot n cold song*    lol 3 was a joke.  but one of my friends actually used that. haha. the dudes face was heck like...I LIKED THIS GIRL???!!! haha
AX3DQw3Paa	I would say try a little bit, back off, try again, back off. It's like fishing. "You reel them in, then give 'em some slack, then you reel them in, then give 'em some slack." Let them pursue you as their best friend.|`|u0jeosbOaa	Friendship should come naturally.It shouldn't be tried to get too much hard.Try to be helpful,pleasing and respectful.Eventually they like you and get closer to you.|`|vFhhy1SPaa	I would say just be yourself and if this guy is as cool as you think he is he'll will open up and come around.  Also try not to come off so strong and give space don't really try let things go with the flow, if that makes sense.
CD5JsjxKaa	i think this list is kind of cute!! and would you believe, just as i was about to answer saying i think it's cute, my husband called me out of the blue!! :) and yes, i was thinking of him and missing him as i read the list!    all the same, i doubt it was reading this post that made him call ;) while the meaning behind those gestures may be true some of the time, they're not set in stone. but cute, none-the-less.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	A kiss is just a kiss if done with the wrong person. Love cannot be understood in the mind...it is the heart that comprehends it.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	If you think this is foreplay, you'll never get to 2nd base with anyone  Quit analyzing everything and get some action!|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	what?|`|JGGbQhCaaa	Are you getting your insights from Hillary or Bill?  Do you have this stuff posted on your refrigerator?  Do you carry it in your wallet and whip it out to figure out what's up?  Too deep for me.  Peace.
KwNpyp3saa	It is understandable for you to feel upset, after all this is what a real relationship is about- enjoying new things together. It does seem like she is not ready for a relationship. She said so herself. It's good you found out now before the wedding. Try to move and realize she did you a favor. Now you can find a woman who will appreciate you. Take care.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Time to dump her and move on, the writing is on the wall and you need someone who reciprocates your own feelings and clearly, she does not and you deserve better.
yoDWhQnhaa	She might need therapy. STAT!
ZtDiWBjmaa	Sorry but taller than me is a MUST. buuuut you never know with this girl. try and ask around or just ask her and see how she feels about it.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	go for it, you don't say your ages people still grow up before there 21 so if that helps.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	its fine i like a boy shorter and younger then me|`|WxvUkXlPaa	girls DO NOT like guys shorter than them. sorryy short stuff|`|3NhsdbDZaa	you should ask the girl you like what she thinks. every girl is different. i, personally, would date a guy younger but, probably not shorter altho i am very short so thats rare.|`|A4OM6nI9aa	age doesnt matter, but if your like wayyyyyyyy shorter than that's gona be a wee bit on the no side. im 5'7 so i wouldnt date anybody shorter than me it's weird enough when they're your height...|`|TkAJOe8caa	its ok
JGGbQhCaaa	Be clear in your heart and mind why you are choosing this path and let those reasons be the breath you breathe when the temptations come. Hold those reasons with high regard within and be willing to share them proudly when/if necessary. Peace.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Maturbate a LOT lol.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	If you don't want to be tempted, don't go looking for one. Just like if you don't want to be bitten by a snake, don't go look for one. In other words, don't allow yourself the opportunity to be tempted. Stay away from dark rooms where you and your girlfriend/boyfriend are alone. There is safety in numbers. Keep that in mind.|`|5k7BexD3aa	doing sex?|`|yfcJwQr8aa	your mind is a lot stronger than your genitals.    You can easily keep yourself out of situations that can make you end up having sex.  You just dont all of a sudden be naked.  you have to take your clothes off or atleast pull your pants down...lol... Its that easy, just dont do it|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Chew lots and lots of gum bro!|`|I0g24Jmkaa	It's all in your head, just keep it in your pants. You can masturbate if need be.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	by keepin it in your pants|`|qKkTI0jnaa	You know, I am a still a virgin & I used to be an advocate of waiting for marriage but after being 20 yrs old & in college & almost going to the point of no return, I can safely say that I don't plan on waiting anymore. If you still want to wait, then abstain, simple as that. It won't be easy & it's not for everyone, but keep fighting the good fight my friend.|`|fSSE9cnLaa	Remind yourself when you have those feelings that when you save it for that special someone and are having sex with them, you will only think of them and not some other chick you did years before. Wait for that because it is a much deeper connection when you have only done it with each other... Trust me... I have only been with one man and he has only been with me...  I wouldn't have it any other way|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Believe me the anticipation is far greater then the realization. Don't go in for a sexual relationship unless you have a committed relationship and be sure your partner feels the same way. Wait for marriage if possible, you will be glad you did.It is not all that earth shattering wonderful anyway. Don't believe all you read|`|Ethykzkoaa	I think it has  to be easier to never get close.   But, thats impossible( you will end up a kissing a girl).  My advice is to remember why you believe in this, and try to stick to it.|`|R1rVPOdGaa	If you wait thats on you, but im not going to wait anymore, i wanted to wait until i found someone i loved/trust but i cant wait any longer because no one is looking for love in my area. Waiting until you are married is great as long as you already have the girfriend/fiance' that agrees to wait.|`|88a3bbbf6dab801eaa5ad76bd8ed789daa	Do some serious business. Get with other things.  Masturbation is not harmful. Try till you get married.

Establish an actual relationship or ...|`|ZYOwcdVcaa	How about a pseudo-relationship?    Answer mine?  First question under my profile titled "how do i get this girl to like me?"|`|kMyZEEhNaa	Real Dolls. Some guys say it's like a real chick and they accept you no matter what. (No sh*t, they're dolls. They have no choice). They don't discriminate against penis size. So, if you're a nerd with a short little dicky, they'll still "love" you.|`|A4OM6nI9aa	a womaly man with many emotions that you should consider!!!!  ahahahahahaha|`|3c32eaf91139f0812d413dfb6485098caa	It's called...he doesn't want to lose you but has no intentions of committing to you either...|`|V4lvmGaoaa	I have the perfect example...my life.  I know this girl who I like and would like to date. But she doesn't want me to get in the way of her school work because she can't get bad grades. So we don't go together but she asks like we do. She gets mad when I don't call. And then she gets really upset when I TALK to other girls as if we do go together and it makes me mad.    Its like a dog on a chain. It can see stuff at a distance but can go anywhere or do anything.    So a say that a fake relationship is where people think something is happening and its not or one person acts like something is going on between another but acts weird about it around others or when someone asks about it.|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	jealousy. stay away from that guy, he is mean.  he is trying to make u feel bad.      heres to those are mean:  http://www.beingmean.webs.com|`|bEbkV69naa	It's called control. Why do you accept it? You have to ask yourself why you care about him getting pissed because you won't let him control your life. What kind of relationship DO you have with this guy? Was there a romance with him that went to 'friendship'? You need to set the boundaries of your 'friendship' before he gets too unbalanced or you could have a psycho on your hands.|`|Lu918yR5aa	idk.. but he fo sure jeolous..|`|a7AiC90yaa	wishing he is in other guy shoe|`|CAOisulkaa	cling
Z0KQenm9aa	thats real important. my heart goes out to you. parents do some dumb things... not really realizing what they are doing. of course they want the best for you but they also have to realize you have to make your own decisions... I dont particularly like my siblings mates... but as long as my siblings are happy i dont have to live with their mates... anyway. its good at least you stay in contact with your dad... to bad he does not ring you once on a while... he loves you but it could be that he just doesnt know how to show it or perhaps your mom is there and he doesnt want to start trouble... just ask him point blank " dad are you angry with me, do you still love me, do you want me to call you to see you to stay in contact with you..."|`|tBMWPAA6aa	You know, it's tough on a dad when he loses his 'little girl'... that being said, I would never doubt that he still loves you, but he probably does NOT love what you've done. He is expected to share your mother's feelings and you probably source many a conversation... even arguments between them(?)  Maybe he gets grief from your mom just by being civil to you over the phone. Try catching him at work some time or on his cell phone when she isn't around.  Maybe you could IM him late at night and ask him if you're putting him on the spot by contacting him at all.   The real solution is to reach out to your mom, not your dad. The healing is with that relationship... anything else just scratches off the scab and makes it bleed a little bit more.  How does your husband feel about this? Maybe his perspective will help, too. Saying " I love you" can be tough on ANY guy, sadly.    Call your mom... it's been long enough,no?|`|up6xgVsAaa	I'm sure he does love u but is still hurt by the fact..its bad that ur mom disowned u over someone u love..but seriously this is something that u need to speak to ur father about|`|bNCcv2fNaa	Yeah, he just knows you guys have gotten past that stage. Weird stuff makes me remember my dad loves me a lot. For example, he went to the Supermarket once and came back with my favorite spicy BBQ wings and I didn't say anything to him. Meant a lot to me.
n9IHOYLuaa	First of all, your boyfriend is insecure and probably likes men.  Second, the world ends tomorrow, anger is not the answer, violence is.  So get your stab on!  Third, toast-her.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	Well, he really shouldn't of lied and said that you were his girlfriend. However, he really like you and I guess just wanted people to know that he really likes you. YOu have the right to be mad, but you should definatley forgive him! Afterall, maybe you like him and possible dont know it yet!|`|rfoxtexNaa	BE ANGRY BECAUSE HE SPREADED A  RUMOR|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	NOOO|`|4dXcZhuTaa	he just likes you...  you had the right to be angry/upset.. but get over it.  it's a compliment, he just really likes you...|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Forgive him for goodness sake. It's a very small infraction and it's already been cleared up he confessed. You might as well forgive and forget rather than carry the anger around.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Yes.|`|j4hmUPJgaa	Silly to be mad at him- you should be flattered he bragged to your friend about dating you. It would be extremely childish to stay mad at him for something so small. He may not have been telling the truth, but in your defense he was proud to say he was dating you. Be flattered!|`|fHgJdJGwaa	Forgive him but ask why he lied and what not.|`|l56Pg5rEaa	I wouldnt freak out about it. At your age relationships are nothing serious anyways. He obviously likes you if he was to tell someone that. And he just told one of his friends, so what. Everything will be alright.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Yeah, you should be angry because a close friend obviously has feelings for you.    Poor guy, cut him some slack.  He didn't mean any harm, he just obviously likes you.|`|SO20Ah2Daa	Honey, you gotta forget that lying sucker. He only wishes he had you, and if he lies to his friends about being with you...you're too good for his sorry bottom!|`|NRFqit39aa	Im a 9th grader =DDD  And I think you have every right to be angry.  But you should forgive him.  I mean, immature boys like us lie to make ourselves seem cool which is retarded.  But, i mean i think you should make sure he knows you're angry, make him feel it for a little while then, let it resolve.   Then again, ive never been put in a situation like that and im not a girl. Haha

I have a couple of pictures at the bottom of the about me page.  I am an independent demonstrator for uppercase living.  We sell decorative vinyl expressions.  You can apply them to the dance floor, windows, vases at the tables.  Check out my website, if you need some other suggestions, contact me through my website. We have snowflakes you can put on vases, or maybe a big snowflake on the dance floor with your names in the middle.  Just some ideas.|`|tBODwcqXaa	I just wrote an article about a winter wedding theme. I suggested wintery blues & silver. There are a lot of winter themed wedding favors, centerpieces, etc. out there. I suggested blue and white hydrangeas. Check out the article at http://somethingbluebook.com/01/theme-id...    Good luck :)|`|0Uo20SmWaa	Snowflakes are too hard. How about a glittery wedding dress with white sparkle on the bottom half?|`|QNuW7ivyaa	I LOVE IT!!  I hate the red and green too.  Not to mention darker colors with silver accents can be so classy and simple at the same time.      You can do both large snowflakes (check the dollar store, believe it or not) and small "confetti" of silver and white.  They also have a lot of snowflake themed favors and such.      Dont forget the possibilty of cutting a HUGE cost in flowers - using branches with dangling snowflakes on dark table clothes with white/silver napkins and accents.|`|AA10351134	This could be brilliant! Check the purple wedding board below, look how lighting and the draped ceiling has transformed the room into a wonderland. Look into submersible LEDs in your centerpieces and talk to your DJ about professional lighting options. To get really dramatic and memorable you can project lighted snowflake shapes onto the walls.    Also check out the soft purple feathers in the bouquet in that pic, feathers are terrific for winter weddings. The silver will ground the event and make it elegant: silver mint julep cups with small florals, silver chargers, a grand silver cake plateau. You can also have a sheer canopy over your cake table, very dramatic, and lots of crystal/glass elements. Don't go overboard with the snowflake motif, use this on the cake and lightly elsewhere, maybe some ornament favors for your guests hanging from a white bare-branch arrangement sprayed with glitter.
gt5Zdy1uaa	Anything you like really or songs you listen to on a daily basis. Just make sure there is a bit of variety since there will be other people there. You can choose any music you and the fiance may like the main part of picking the songs will be for the key moments like    Walking Down the Isle   First Dance  Garter retrieving/toss  Throwing the Boquet   Last Dance  Father Daughter-Mother Son etc...  Entering the reception     some also have songs for the bridal party and grooms men if they are  going to be doing a dance. Have fun. Congrats!|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	GO to these websites:    http://www.ourweddingsongs.com/    http://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-songs    http://www.discjockeys.com/top_wedding.p...    It has example ceremony songs and reception songs. Also, if you have a good DJ with a lot of positive reviews from happy customers, let him/her know what genres you like, and they'll know what to play. Thanks what I'm doing. Its just too difficult to pick all the songs you want, but if you dont have a DJ, I can see why you're asking for help. Good Luck
HVG32PWuaa	not funny|`|WU0Btmqzaa	i dont get it. lol
1vKiGBF4aa	Yes, I was 10 years old my brothers and I were watching T.V and this gas bomb took over me I dove behind the sofa I couldn't hardly see or breath my eyes burned and my breath was taken. I grabbed things that were around me a spray bottle & I ripped my new white dress and tied a piece of it around the top of the bottle I gentle raised it up over the back of the sofa waving it back and forth..  this flag meant that I surrendered...  I surrendered to the fart king, even to his day he can clear a room.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	What do you mean? It's just the marking your country or state uses to separate itself from others. Most likely originally used to identify enemies or allies on battlefields. I made a flag for my family name and seal once it evokes pride if that's what you're asking?
sqNsOIzkaa	The cruelest thing a friend did to me was in freshmen year. She and I stole alcohol from a local Safeway branch. I had the stuff in my backpack and when we got caught by the manager she cried like a stuck pig. Then she pointed her fingers at me and said it was all my fault and that she wasn't going to drink it. Even though we stole like two whole packs of alcohol, and I can't finish that.They let her go because she didn't have possession of the alcohol on it. Then later she came to school bragging about it..I realized I was a stupid person for even knowing such a knitwit.     The sweetest thing my best friend had done for me was surprise me for my birthday with a blindfolded trip to Great America haha and a party afterwards =D She's still my friend =P    The girl that ratted me out is not my friend anymore. During high school we still talked a bit but then I realized she was an emotional wreck and very unstable. She even lied about being raped! Turns out the guy she knew for only a month had sex with her when they were drunk. She really liked him and he promised to go to Las Vegas with her, but he ended up avoiding her. So she lied about it to cover up the embarassment. Who lies about being raped?! I'm glad I am not her friend anymore. I was very happy to know I wasn't the only one who felt that way about her.    Bam! Talk about high school drama there. Thank goodness I'm in college and completely different from my high school self. Its a breather to not be as dumb as her.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I fixed my best friend up with my husbands brother. After they married she said we could not be friends anymore. She said that we were family now and family does not need to be in her business. She changed so much, ran them into debt twice. Now that they are divorced she calls me and wants to talk. Sorry about her luck but she is out.|`|69qn7muFaa	He betrayed me.. He said he trusted me but all he did was lie to me, constantly. He messed with my feelings like he didn't even care.  Like I was a toy to him.    He made me feel like I was important for once. This was before he ruined our friendship.     No, we are not friends.. He's turned into one of those wannabe jocks.     I try to forget it, I just remember that I've got better things than him. I've got a best friend who I love to death, she's my best friend for life. We've been friends for 10 years. And I realize now that he wasn't truthful to me.
6QIpltVyaa	Human nature is my best answer, we take for granted the people who are nice to us b/c they don't purpose a "threat" to us, the people who are snobby and stuck up are like this b/c they probably have alot of money but no etiquette's. They become more of a threat and so people cant stand up to them, they usually just start to respect them more. An example is Donald Trump and maybe your nice pizza guy around the corner. DT is rich, has been married many times, and media loves him but he's a snob. The pizza guy around the corner may not have alot of money and may be nice but his friends will be alot less then DT b/c he generally doesn't pose a threat.|`|iiRU9kEoaa	I know how you feel :(  its probably because they demand their stuff, but the nice people just go with the flow.|`|jBk1b4r6aa	yes we do!!|`|6Oprylquaa	If you find out let me know :X|`|3vsnteRuaa	Yeah. I know how you feel. I realized it to. I just think of it as a good thing cuz that means later in life when your in twenties and thirties it means you will have fun! Unlike the people who have it good now will have a sucky life because they got into stupid drugs and junk like that, once you do that you screw up your life!!! So i will hopefully a great life. But dont get me wrong i love my life now but there are lots of people out there who have it better.|`|i3VwvtcCaa	nice people tend to be more helpful and kind, which makes them a door mat for the jerks. ive noticed the more i try to help the more i get taken advantage of because im too nice to say no or lash out at them.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You are absolutely right, I was just thinking about that tonight. There is a book, I haven't read it but maybe I should, called "When Bad Things Happen to Good People."|`|acWyJ3t0aa	I know that it appears to be that way , but when push  comes to shove those friends of the arrogant , snobby, rich folks find  out that they had no true friends , when the money , the parties , etc  ran out , so did the friends to the next person they could mooch off of . The other person on the other hand that you know has pain in their life like all  of us , but they know that God never gives you more than you and he can handle , so very few people even know about the trouble . They trust and believe that if they need something or someone , God will provide as he always does . They do not live life looking for rewards , rather they live their life knowing that their reward is  in heaven . People that feel the way towards someone that you describe in the end , just think how they must feel when someone they used or someone they actually hated leaves them something in their will . There is a reason for everything that happens , sometimes only God knows what that reason is . They may look suffering on this earth , but when they get to their home in heaven they will have their just rewards .|`|AX3DQw3Paa	There's a saying that "Bad things happen to good people." It's a phenemon that has yet to be explained. Perhaps it is because the snobbish people are willing to do more to get ahead in life? Or maybe because the nice people 'threaten' us? We could always want to be the ones to take the snobby people down and what way could be better than by being their bff? Also, there's always the possibility that we're afraid of what they'll do to us if we aren't their friend...   Then again, there just might be more of that kind in the world. Like attracts like.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Let's see. Here are the things that I have learned over the course of my marriage and often the hard way... by learning from mistakes.    Always talk and keep open lines of communication a must. Create an environment where your spouse feels free to share anything with you.    Remember that your spouse loves you and even when you think that they have done something out of spite or to intentionally hurt you, consider that perhaps they did not.    As long as you share the same core values and beliefs, don't sweat the small things in life. Allow personal tastes and differences to live without becoming sore spots.    When you do argue remember that knowing you are right is often better than proving it. Try hard not to ram your points home at the expense of the pride or self esteem of the other.    Over time you will get to know each other inside and out and never deliver a death blow during an argument that prey's upon your spouses biggest fears or deepest insecurities. We all know are faults and weak points and are very protective of them.    When you know your spouse is wrong, let them up for air, let them escape with some dignity. Women tend to get drawn into a disagreement due to lack of understanding something... It is easy to misinturpert a man's moods or feelings.  Men tend to get more upset when they realize that they are wrong. Try to avoid allowing either set of frustrations to boil over.    Always stay active in each others lives... give each other the room to breath once and a while but don't allow yourself to build seperate lives, you should always orbit one another.    Don't become roommates. Never forget that you are married and don't stop dating just because you wear those rings. This is mostly for men I think, but always make your wife feel special.    Always keep passion and a flriy nature alive. Surprise each other on a daily basis... and avoid watching too much TV.    I think that biggest thing is that if both people make it a habit to put the other first then you will have a win/win marriage.    Well, I hope that helps... I am not sure that the words came out just how I meant them but good luck to you. I have been married for 10 years and they have been the best 10 years that a guy could ever hope for. God Bless your upcoming marriage.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Lots and lots of Communication and always be honest with each other.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	both of you should try to be of one mind.    try to discuss not argue.    each of you should respect each other.    live within your means. save and keep some money so that you always have cash. avoid credit cards, if possible, they can cause serious problems.    spend time together and do things together. for example, go to the groceries together, to church together, beach together.    if you do everything together you will both fall more deeply in love and become more harmonious.    will there be carping and things to make each of you angry? yes, yes, yes!    however, if you are considerate of each other and leave  the anger and vindictiveness outside, things should be really great.     do not carry grudges.    do not have idlers hanging around your home. this will help avoid infidelity    nothing like having a very loving and thoughtful spouse who cares about you and always wants best for you.    best wishes, hope you have a very loving life together.      ps: do not be spiteful.    do not lie to each other.    one lady above said:' pick your battles'. no don't battle each other. love and respect each other.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	make sure you pick your battles. and always communicate. also figure out NOW about finances. its hard and people struggle with it.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Don't worry about yourself.

Respect for each other is the main thing. Plus, make sure expectations are reasonable, not what you think everyone says they should be. He is now who he will be later. If there are any major faults, decide now to live with them, or you will resent them and that will lead to lack of respect, which leads to all sorts of problems.  Lay out your expectations with each other, and that way there will be no confusion. It will also bring to light any issues you may have with him, or him with you.  good luck !|`|3MKHCgE3aa	Before you make it official, talk about your views of what marriage is and what you expect from each other.  Respect yourself and each other, communicate and compromise. Love each other more than you love yourself.  Consider your marriage a continuous date, not being tied down.

hW419Rfbaa	I just found out that my parents were getting a divorce.  The only thing I'm really concerned about is moving  into a smaller house, seeing that I not to long ago moved  into my current house, I'm going to have to move again, only  downsizing. I want my parents to be happy, but I don't think  getting a divorce will make them happy-er. But I'll just have  to go along with whatever they think is best.    Anyway, back to your question, some people are not bothered  much when they find out their parents are getting a divorce.  Sometimes it's because their parents fight alot, and they just  want it to end. Sometimes it's because they are emotionally  still. Sometimes it's because they saw it coming, and were  already emotionally prepared for the situation, ect. So it's not  un-normal that you aren't sad or mad right now. You may be  later on though, because you may just be in shock still.  But who knows.    Good luck to you, and I hope all goes well!|`|I9LTTno2aa	When i was a little girl my parents got divorced and the strange part was I was happy about it. So your not alone.

Men are not the answer to your self esteem issues.  Being by yourself is one of the strongest things you can do - you need to do this for yourself.

You can then dial her number until you can contact her parents. But, best bet call very early in the morning like 6am...you know the parents will definately pick up the phone wondering who the hell is calling them.

Instinct, my friend. Plus, don't bar bade her with messages, that will take the fun out of talking to her on the phone or in person. Leave things for you both to talk about when you can actually see her. If everything is discussed in text's then its sure to make a boring time when you actually get to see her. Leave her wanting a little more and leave you wanting more. Don't spoil it.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	If she txts you back with something you can't respond to, then don't respond. For example if you ask her "what are you doing tonight?" and she responds "I don't know", then that's the end of the conversation. Because if she wants to keep talking to you, should might say "I don't know, what are you doing tonight?". I do that. To guys that I'm not interested in, I end the conversation.  If they start to talk about something else, I'll find a way to end That conversation as well. If they still can't take the hint, I just start to ignore all of their calls.    I even signed up for voice mail just to screen my calls without missing the important ones (say from a job offer).|`|vmVF3S8Zaa	yeah, try a topic change..    remember when texting, always include a question in the one you send, so the other person has to reply    good luck :)|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think asking her once every two days is about sufficient.

Just hang out with her.|`|hzBILdNvaa	You can usually tell if you are texting someone too much by the type of responses that you get back or by the amount of time that it takes someone to respond back.  For example when you get back a really short response to a question that she would normally respond with a longer response then she might be getting aggravated or if it takes her a really long time to respond back then she might be aggravated.  The best thing to do might be just to talk to her and ask her opinion so that there are no problems.      I am not sure what you mean by "something that you cant respond to", but I can assure you that changing the subject with a woman is never a good idea.

1bb0f7ae2b31d51224421eb6bee127fbaa	The second most fertile group of women is age 41-46, the first is age 16-19.  There is only 2 percent difference in the fertility of the 2 groups.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Lots of women can and have had a baby for the first time in their 40's.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	It is not a myth.  Women's chances of conceiving naturally decrease dramatically at age 35. The chances of miscarriage, small birth weight and genetic abnormalities also increase.  This does not mean you can't have children older, but the risks are higher.  But with fertility treatments available these days, chances are greater than they ever used to be. But it is not a given.    Having said that, I don't believe, if you are planning on having children, you should wait just because you can. There is no guarantee, as it is an individual thing, and many wait until they are in their late 30's and even fertility treatments and IVF don't work for them.    I had my first child at 28 and second at 35, and believe me, a toddler later in life, is MUCH harder to keep up with.  After my pregnancy at 35, I strongly believe we were never meant to have babies at that age.    Edited to add: My pregnancy at 35 was not without problems - 2 miscarriages before I had a viable pregnancy, and baby born at 5lb 2oz, and in a special care nursery for 2 weeks, so very difficult. While I love her to bits, and wouldn't change a thing, if I had the choice, I wouldn't wait.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Until they reach menopause and cannot produce eggs anymore. I had all my children in my 20's. Having babies at an older age just increases health risks to the baby and the mother. I am in my early 40's and I would not want a new baby at my age. It would be awful to have to go through taking care of one and having a little child running around the house when I am in my 50's and my child not graduating from high school until I am about 60. I don't recommend any woman to have children past age 30 just for these reasons. I am glad I had my children at a young age. Now I can relax and enjoy the grandchildren and give them back to their moms.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	no its true. After 35 its called geriatric pregnancy and the risks of things like downs syndrome and birth defects.    Biologically, the ideal age for having children is between 16 - 28.    Biologically 35 year old women are not meant to have children. They are just too old. If they were meant to then we wouldnt have the menopause.     Plus grannies having babies is just wrong.|`|UsPexIj0aa	All of the above answers are correct...    It isn't a myth that an individual woman's chance of conceiving naturally after age 35 decrease.  It is also true that the rate of miscarriage and birth defects also increase with maternal age.  That doesn't mean that women don't become pregnant after 35 or 40 and have healthy children.  Younger women vary in their ability to conceive as well.  But the statistics are compiled by lumping all women together and calculating risks and outcomes.     Fertility rates are not the same thing as an individual woman's odds of becoming pregnant.  Fertility rate is defined as the ratio of live births in an area to the population of that area; expressed per 1000 population per year [syn: birthrate, birth rate, fertility, natality].  The rates of live births to women older than 35 has increased and are higher than those of women 16 - 19.  Women 25 - 29 have the highest fertility rate (birthrate) at 116 births per 1,000.  Women 35 - 39 have a fertility rate of 46 per 1,000. Women 16 to 19 have a fertility rate of 40 per 1,000. A woman in her later teens will have a greater chance of becoming pregnant than a woman in her late 30's, but because women in this age group are often waiting the two groups have similar fertility rates.     As far an individual woman's chances of having a child after 35, that depends on the individual woman and whether she has viable eggs.  It varies greatly from one women to another.  However statistically risks do change.  The rate of miscarriage is much higher for women over 40.  Many of those miscarriages happen so early they are mistaken for irregular periods.  However, the risks of miscarriages increase similarly in women who have had previous miscarriages. I have attached a link to a table that gives statistics by age.      The rates of conceiving naturally drop with increasing age. At 40 woman's chance of conceiving within a year is about 40 to 50 percent. A woman in her mid-30s has a 75 percent chance. A fertility specialist in the article I will site states that he has never seen a woman get pregnant with her own eggs after 46.  He compares it to a lottery ticket.  It could happen, but don't count on it.  I've attached a link to this article.  It is very informative and gives lots of information to women who wish to get pregnant in their 40's.     I know this is long - it's important to understand what all this really means whether you choose to start a family now or wait.  Best Wishes!
11a003236016ddd45f2ddc918a54b603aa	Which face is the real one?  Its actually a combination of both, when he was drunk and said that, he might have meant it, and when when he was sober enough to tell you that he needs to get drunk before telling you that you are sexy and everything, he might have meant that too. Men, as many women know has a poor sense of emotional sensitivity, both to their partner and to themselves. We are much more logical than emotional. this means that whatever we are feeling deep inside, we keep it deep inside, and if we ever express them, its not through words but through action. But if we're drunk, we become less logical and thus spill things we keep well guarded that later on we will regret even if its something nice for many women to hear.  Your husband may have a difficulty accepting that you are too beautiful for him (thus the jealousy). This might make him insecure in a way.  Assure him that you love him (if you really do), and suggest that he can tell you anything he wants to tell you and you to him.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I wouldn't let this hurt my feelings if I were you.

Thats ridiculous. Get him to see some someone for this... thats unhealthy and a bit scary that he would want to kill the other guy or you.

I do agree with the other person saying that its easier for him to open up under alcohol. Maybe he feels that if he tells you when sober that you will think of him less of a man and the alcohol can be an excuse. I am not a professional in this and since the two of you are married maybe seeing a counselor would be best. They would be able to sit down and really have him open up. He does sound as if though he loves you, but he really does not know how to express it to you. Take steps in order to reach that goal in which he will compliment you and not under the influence.|`|ffxB7EdZaa	Your husband may have insecurities about his own looks and complimenting you may make him feel like he's not good enough for you.     The fact that your husband threatened to kill you sets off a red light in my head.    You should seek couple's counseling to deal with his insecurity and the lack of communication in your relationship. If it bothers you that he doesn't compliment you sober, you should tell him instead of asking others why he doesn't do it.     Try to open up and be more honest with one another and it will be easier for him to trust you and make you both feel better about the relationship in the long run.     You should also keep an eye out for signs of alcoholism. Bring the subject up if you have heavy fears that he is showing signs of alcoholism, but do not press the issue. Alcoholics typically do not believe they have a problem.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	To be honest both are real.  I think that after a few drinks your husband is still himself but is able to let his guard down.  Its not that what he says isn't true, but he is able to say it without it being awkward.

Good, huh!!  She'll grow out of it.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Sorry to hear that, but you just have to let her see and realize what she's doing to herself and family. I can't really help you with this, it's a battle you must fight. You need to know what cause this too, maybe you can help her if you find out.|`|rt98MMCiaa	she is 18, let her live her life and you live yours, sometimes parents imagine things and amplify problems to make them larger than life, bear that in mind, when they're on menopause or andropause|`|n5u3rkV4aa	I'm really not sure what you can do - i know people who arent that bad but do smoke and drink a bit and all that and there is no convincing them out of it - you could try counselling which can work by trying to get them to want to stop. Otherwise i'm not really sure what you can do. Its a tough situation, hopefully she will see that she isn't living right and will stop but who knows? Good luck =D|`|eO429roGaa	Spoilt brat syndrome.    Its the parents fault shes the way she is.|`|9jMJeVOhaa	Rehab. She's an alcoholic and it's something your family cannot handle on it's own.     Good luck.|`|X6RwSrJjaa	Get her checked into a rehab center. She will not want to go, and you will have to physically force her to go. If you must, call the police. She will hate you, but might thank you later. You have to attempt to do something before her death. If the rehab does not work, then its too late. Your Aunt and Uncle failed at their parenting duties, and were unable to fix the problem in time. Best option there is to give up, kick her out, and start getting mentally prepared for her funeral or jail visits.
TShsb3EXaa	You can't help the way you feel!   Its not someones fault that they may have to be in an environment with people they don't like, look a certain way that they do not like or have had experiences that have forced them into that condition.  It is a really serious matter.|`|AQ3QqA5daa	Definately not!! It is difficult and hard to get over it and move on  but your head makes it seem like it's impossible...    YOu can work at it and feel better etc but it is not your own fault x|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	no - I suffered with terrible post natal depression after having my children - it wasn't "my fault" it was due to a hormone imbalance and chemical imbalance in my brain.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	To a degree. Some times it can be managed better eg seeking the right help etc. But not always easy.|`|FXD0rHyzaa	no dont be stupid !!  im sorry but this is a really serious subject for me   because i myself am depressed due to my mothers actions   most depressed people are depressed because they have been through alot or have seen some thing horrific
jB5cMnGFaa	there isn't a man or woman on the planet who can completely understand anyone lol!! I can only speak for myself, but I don't go out LOOKING! But when I have met someone I have then turned out to date it is always by natural happenstance. The man I am with and I just click....we have everything from sexual attraction, shared interests, great communication, respect, common experiences & high appreciation of each other....I could go on....everyone is different though--we dated 14 yrs ago and didn't have the same understanding back then to fully appreciate what a great thing we had. We broke up and parted ways only to look for each other & miss each other as the years went by & maturity set in. I can only feel that we were guided back by Love and God and now we fully appreciate the beauty we have. Any girl who is looking for a guy who doesn't really get it never will either lol!|`|pQBjqMkoaa	i like guys who are complicated    EDIT: yeah jenny i agree|`|uUWdxKSWaa	i JUST NEED POiNTS
TUlh5ATxaa	You lost it to me. Remember?|`|5ph71VMvaa	No, you are still a virgin sorry.|`|nFVYFWwRaa	this is just dum|`|t1NTGuIZaa	yes, and you will probably remain a virgin for a loooooooong time...|`|DhDf9FbZaa	not sure i think we need some kind of consultation of a higher power like bill cosby|`|CKQtOusTaa	OMG 3Sim LOOOL|`|QSxdmwAjaa	with a honeydew?      wow.       ok. well anyways............ yeah. you're definitely still a virgin.|`|mWfCI1Fgaa	you virginassmotherfukcah|`|syKIxX45aa	Technically you are an idiot for posting such a reticules question, so think again have you had penetrative sex with a not her human if no then this is your answer.  YES. you are.|`|COJq7M4Eaa	you will only lose your virginity if you have sex with an opposite sex.. and if you fingered yourself and you bleed, it means you are not virgin anymore|`|N1qKXDs2aa	still a virgin|`|AA10852244	to both...|`|9z5NASypaa	ryan seacrest|`|rn3Bg4oDaa	Both|`|16e864c8723d0a5a347f97a0ac5d3c6faa	well at least you were not knocking one off to clay aiken|`|tFC13Xsgaa	yes u are   im sorry mate  people do crazy things|`|yEosR5Naaa	DID YOU BLEED ?|`|el2blDi4aa	yes|`|hiToH4kCaa	You lost it to both! Congratulations!  But just in case ask Maury who the winner is.|`|koXcq0l1aa	no, you're still a virgin.  But ask the honeydew and see what it says.  It has an opinion too!
X3lrPVbKaa	There shouldnt be but my friend im sure you've heard that sex makes thing complicated. Keep it simple dont ruin the friendship with sex. Friends with benerfits doesnt work always. Unless, you and the other party are ruthless and cold hearted.|`|R4F05z4Faa	you can do sex anybody but what your moral says?|`|XZRb2YVVaa	Well there should be...  If there is a desire that does not mean u have sex..  I had a friend who said he can't talk with me unless he had sex  he was like " forget me"  yes i am interested in sex but the way he said it....  it hurts....|`|uq9KBBPNaa	go ahead...have fun|`|wppCSDHNaa	yes, well said .. but it never happenes in real life. After sex things come in a different way and sometimes mutual agreement lands up as forceful acceptance. so beware|`|59CaFeS8aa	Do not beat around the bush    If you want to do it and be smart at it, just go ahead.    Dont try to fool others.
nFVYFWwRaa	go for it I like girls to come after me as I am not one to go after them I have had my feelings hurt too many times to just go for it now, earlier I would have chased her now I want her to chase me.|`|08y217Rdaa	If you go after him, there will be other things that will be short. If longevity means anything to you, just wait.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Wait...|`|sYwkpH7Jaa	just wait n watch my dear
BK42HJ44aa	You should feel great that you guys have a normal sex life!!!!! Thats one of the top ten problems with couple now a days that they dont have enough sex. First your friends shouldnt be snooping through your computer what you and him do is you and him. And there is nothing worng with porn me and my boyfriend watch it all the time to. Mostly to get ideas for bed ;). And me and my significant other usually have sex twice a day we set the alarm a 1/2 hour earlier than we have to be up just to fool around and then again before we go to bed and if we are both in the mood a quickie in the middle of the day. I am very thankful we have a active sex life since we have been together for two years. All it shows is you truly care and you are attracted to your partner so its very normal. Just tell your friends to stop hating cause your sex life is so awesome :).|`|O36qjj7Oaa	There is no such thing as to much sex.    Your friends are just jealous because you are probably getting more sex then they are and from now on dont talk to your friends about your sex life cause its really none of their business.    Keep having as much sex as you want there is nothing wrong with that and dont worry about what other people think or say.|`|z9DvICCuaa	you have it almost every day that you can??   so i am assuming once a day  that aint too much honey:) especially if u guys have only been together for 10 months..|`|EMKuBql8aa	Well, you seem perfectly fine with it so keep having fun! Don't let other people confuse you. If you feel comfortable, that is all that matters. I don't think it is not normal or bad, I think you are lucky to have a good sex life. That subject is written so much in articles because people covet it. Feel lucky.    My wife and I have sex about 3 times a week.|`|jK9yiQq6aa	your talking about sex addiction, and the best way to tell is if it is creating negative consequences in your life, I.e. missing work or appointments causing physical irritations. other than that just go at it like rabbits on speed, and have fun.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	From what you said here...the relationship is only about sex and the frequency of it....Do not get married for sex either...you'll be in for a big letdown|`|PRUXtYh5aa	As long as you are careful and responsible (not sleeping around with anyone you can) your sex life is great.  Wish I still had that sometimes.  In a healthy relationship there is never such a thing as too much sex. Your friends are secretly envious.  They wish they had what you have.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	You're a human, the want of pleasure is normal. No you can't overdue it... unless it's several times a day.|`|RZfDrdIRaa	To much sex???? Is that possible?!?!?!|`|chZFmJOPaa	No! Thats good! It means you still have the spark together. Youre really going to want to have that after getting married. So keep it up, but dont get bored with it.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	You sex life cannot be too good if you have to rely on porn to turn you on|`|AA11313204	your friends need to get their own lives. be glad you two are sexually compatible and stop worrying what they think.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	No one can say, each couple has different needs and different libidos.   I doubt it is abnormal for your unique situation.     My wife and I have s3x on average 3 times a week, we are in our mid and late 40's.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	There is nothing wrong with that at all. In fact if more couples had more sex there would be a lot more happier and stronger marriages. You two should keep it going at whatever pace makes you both happy.    The funny thing is that when you are young like the two of you are sex is fun and important... worth being 20 minutes late to work for. Then all of a sudden when people get older they fill their lives with so much clutter and they stop making time for each other...     I say stock up on the Gatorade and turn your cell phones off! Keep it going! Now maybe your friends are right about one thing, maybe if you talk about your sex life too much you should cut that back... no one needs to know what goes on behind closed doors...|`|r8aEwUBUaa	i was turning 18 and he was 21  i was the virgin in this case.  its normal.  hahaha the first yr of my relationship was like that also!!!3 times a day and stuff but i mean hey if your comfortable wit your man then then theres is no problem. let me guess, your friends are single?? and if im rite then they are most likely jealous lol!!    ps  have the stay off your computer as simple as 1..2..3!|`|HlDORDadaa	It's all personal opinion. If you feel like you are doing it too much then tell him you want to stop. If it's just your friends saying wow you're a nympho tell them to mind their own business. Lots of couples have sex every day 3 weeks out of the month =P.|`|NOhfm4qdaa	If you sex life feels natural to the both of you. Then no, you are no having too much sex. Keep fun and fulfilling and there is no such thing as too much sex. If it become routine and you aren't that into it. Then you having too much. As long as you both enjoy the quantity, then go at it like bunnies. That feeling won't last forever so enjoy it will it hot.
F3UjXpmTaa	Oh alright! Well I was given a book called "girlfriend you are a b.a.b.e!" and it sent my self-esteem through the roof!   What we call beauty now is way overrated.   Personality can shine through and create beauty, no matter how you feel about how you look.   You obviously seem like a caring and loyal girl, there's a start.   List the positive things about yourself.   And just say, "what are flaws?" more like little things that create character.   Take any snobby highschool cheerleader and put her nose to nose infront of a mirror.    She's going to see zits, pores, an uneven hair line, the list goes on!   Nobody is perfect, everyone is beautiful.   Excersize is a BIG self-esteem booster!   Try working out, you'll see that it does wonders for how you feel.|`|oyv6JMgOaa	you just have to realize what you're good at and be proud of that.  i don't know exactly why you're so hard on yourself but for me, i compare myself to everyone else and whenever my friends ace a test and i pass with a D i go into a little depression spell and they get mad at me too.  if that how it is for you just realize you cna't be good at everything and you have your own talents ands its ok to be bad at stuff.  if that's not it just do whatever makes you feel good about yourself, i work out and become an overconfident idiot for a few days:p|`|EMFWNLeraa	Well you don't say how old you are but I am guessing young and without much self confidence.  Some folks put themselves down hoping that their friend will say "no, you are not like that" as that makes you feel great.  Are you fishing for compliments because you do not get many?  You do not get many because you are young and have not had many successes yet in life.  As you live more and have a few more minor victories, you will feel better and more confident.  Please stop this bad habit and seek to make others feel great about them-self then YOU will, in turn, feel better about yourself.  Besides it is really tiresome to be a friend of someone that you have to do all the work to keep them bucked up and happy.  When you are a friend or want to keep a friend you need to bring your best game to the party.  That includes being cheerful and not moaning about being worthless.  Anyway, they may start to believe you and then not want to be your friend as you are too high maintenance.|`|HI5aBVYgaa	I am the same way and im still learning how to deal with it. Everyday when i wake up i look at myself in the mirror and think about what i like about myself and i say to myself that its going to be a good day lol I know it sounds kida cheesy but it helps =). Then when I get the urge to compare myself with others or think they are better than me I simply turn that into compliments. Like for ex: I think her hair is way nicer than mines....SO i say Her hair is so nice I wonder how she does it. By turning your negative thoughts into positive thoughts good things will come your way. I know how you feel but you have to really force yourself and accept yourself the way you are. Hope I helped Good Luck.|`|pvosPN40aa	I am the same way. I think it has to do with having an introverted personality. At times I am a little self consumed. I would suggest that if you really feel you are fat and no fun to be around, to do things to change that. If you feel your fat, lose weight, and work on your personality. It has helped me, although I have OCD and have spend the last few years trying to perfect myself in every way possible, making myself more intelligent, funnier, and more physically attractive. Although self hatred continues and doubts are constant about how others view me, I do feel more confident
KWENGfsjaa	i'm 18 now. i would go as low as 15..so 3  to 3 1/2 years younger.  as for older...umm. 6 months. haha.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Nothing younger than 18.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	16|`|xX9D292Laa	I am 22 and wouldn't date anyone under 37|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	18.  I'm not one of those "date someone your own age" or "1/2 your age +7" people    I'm in my twenties so thats as low as I would go. In my town we have dating agencies that will hook up older guys younger women so I will never have a problem finding an 18 year old when I get older. I never plan to marry so I'm just going to have fun until I'm 45. I dont want a cougar. I want to BE one. A male one.|`|l2FrvejBaa	THe yougngest person I would date would be the same age as mine.... coz the experience in relationship is more likely to be involved sooner or later.

You're not that good anyway..I told you this already!!|`|chZFmJOPaa	Break it off. Shes obviously complaining for a reason. You probably have some problems that need to be worked on. Alone.|`|1hlIzEnTaa	Depends what it's about, she might just be complaining because it's the only way she thinks she can get you to listen, or she needs to vent about something.. If she's complaining about how her hair sucks, or she has nothing to wear.. then I'm sorry it's probably impossible.If she's complaining about work,or people..try asking her what's going on and listening to her, ask if there's anything you can do even though it's very unlikely, she probably just need to let of some steam and feel like she has somebody to talk to who understands|`|gRsuXxkbaa	according to recent studies by nuerologists.....women have a complaining section in their brain..... unfortunately it hasnt been found by dr.s thus it cannot be surgically removes but thnx to the recent stimulus funding will help this not be a problem in 2010 lol|`|D6pfv64maa	wow can't believe some of the answers on here.  did u try and sit down with her and talk to her about it?  if not be nice when doin it and tell her that u have a hard time with her complaining all the time maybe u can help her with it.  good luck hope all works out for ya|`|e5cbcb4ac6c942012d08df3df6d9915baa	it depends on what she is complaining about|`|g5wninniaa	hahahah dude...dont even try to stop her...just block her out when she complains...and nod here and there!    remember..girls are NEVER wrong...just always agree and remember in the back of ur mind that u are right!|`|q5cZ2UbVaa	lol its possible play the copy cat game lol my ex did that to me when i would complain and i shut up real quick cuz it got on my dam nerves|`|wRwEpVsOaa	Dude are you F****** retarded...

Women complain about EVERYTHING. Women even complain about GOOD things.... like getting too much male attention. Attention they actually went out of their way to seek.    "OMG! Omg I was wearing this low-cut blouse today because it was hot, and this guy was looking at my boobs!! I totally HATE that. Men are pigs."    When you KNOW women complain about everything (even getting attention they go out of their way to seek) it's starts to get really funny - really fast.    SMILE. And shake your head. Then take it way over the top....    "AW does that really bother you? You poor thing. You wore a low-cut top and a guy looked at it? That's gotta suck for you."    SHE'LL get the message -->> fast.    --------------------------------------... EDIT ----------------------------  And can someone please tell Alexis' Mommy (above) that a man is allowed to sleep with whoever he wants.... whenever he wants.  MacDonalds doesn't get to call a man a cheater because he eats at Burger King too. That's none of her business. If she doesn't like it --- too bad. Why doesn't ALEXIS' MOMMY try being a sweetheart to keep a man around instead of threatening to cut his D---- off.    Jeez.|`|93821bdb5da3d5a2f104f4b3594f9053aa	tell her to stop complaining and tell her how annoying she is.

I did go back and finish my answer to you however. :-) Good luck hun!|`|BBlfetz3aa	be upfront with him and tell him its time to grow up and change or its over. i went through a similar situation with my being rude and somewhat ignorant toward my now wife and when i was given the ultimatum i "maned up". he may not realize how much it affects you, i know i didn't.|`|O8zOZzO6aa	Very simple Cal. First you have to decide you still want him around or not.    If you still want him cos otherwise he's a good guy, you have to simply play "dumb" when he goes into his trances of criticizing and insulting. Do not reply unless absolutely necessary. Soon he'll get the idea you don't like his behavior.    Then, if you don't want him, well, just tell him to go criticize and insult the trees in the forests!!
WyCmQBuvaa	The hospital is not allowed to give you any information.  If you can find a directory of hospital staff and recognize someone that knew you and /or her back then, try to contact them.  If she was a nurse or CNA or some position that requires state certification, you can try looking this person up that way.  Nurses have to keep up their education and you might be able to find her that way.  Good luck.|`|PCBQbQmraa	Stalker >. >|`|xItSR9Z7aa	No, I don't think the hospital will give you the information.

53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Maybe but some guys are just always nervous. Don't read too much into it unless he gives you other 'clues'|`|yEosR5Naaa	NO HE JUST TRYING TO READ YOU .|`|ea6NWQ78aa	sorry, but usually it is the other way around - all though there is no way for us to know for sure.  look for things, especially eye contact, him starting a convo with you, him "accidentally" bumping into you, if he stares, does he immediately turn away to try to pass it off as nothing.  if so, he may like you.  sorry, you have to do a little investigating.  best of luck!|`|L69jZMXQaa	then he's realllly comfortable around you. or he doesnt care what u think|`|N1qKXDs2aa	that or.....you're in the friend zone.    i suggest watching Just Friends except watch it from the girl's perspective|`|T8CHurVaaa	Nope. Normally a guy is nervous around the girl he likes.|`|Q79IWCBxaa	Either he likes you or he thinks your gonna kill him.|`|YzhYFu0eaa	No necessarily.  Just comfortable with you.  Though, it doesn't rule out that he could like you in the future.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	either that or you're a comfortable person to be around
gPtt8e0iaa	He doesn't like you and is annoyed by your company. Any time a guy sighs he is usually pissed off but doesn't want to say anything about it.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	there is probably something gooing on in his life|`|g8kIjpwSaa	He likes you.|`|jK9yiQq6aa	its a sigh of contentment.............he likes you|`|FJ6960c8aa	i think he is tryng to make fun of you.. kick his ***!!|`|lVNYRSs8aa	he knows he can never have you...PROVE HIM WRONG!|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	He is a jerk. Even if he likes you forget about him. Get with a guy whos nice to you who doesnt tease.|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	didnt u just ask this|`|sLGlL17naa	Well if he does that after he tells you a joke then that means you don't get the joke....and he probably likes you too.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Is it because its the beginning of school or last class for school? He could be tired.|`|EIr9e67eaa	It depends what kind of sigh.  like "ughhhh.. not you again sigh"  or like "ahh, it's her.. she's so pretty"    or something like that!  Yeah, you have to know what kind of sigh :/|`|uUWdxKSWaa	DAMN YOU MUST BE UGLY|`|YMdTPNhlaa	Hey the guy is  little bit nervous when he talk to you so he is inhaling lot of air and he might be very hot when he sits back to you.    EX. I think you might be wearing some sex dress. So he get tempted and he is giving out lot of air dear. So i You feel that you like him have fun no problem.|`|OiEmmiZvaa	It sounds awfully like he's tooling you.  If he looks like he's annoyed when he sighs it might be a sign of contempt?  He sounds like he no longer values your friendship; I would confront him about it, and blatantly ask whether or not he's seriously interested in you.  If trying to open a conversation like that angers him or he tries to push it off i.e. "Not right now", or "Yeah yeah yeah, just stop it" I would break it up.  If he sounds worried or scared, I would be relieved that he is open to having a serious conversation with you and still holds you in high regard.    Alternatively, he might need space from you?|`|q0QYDtH7aa	means he wants to say something but can't man up and let it out|`|tEmDZIpPaa	to annoy you, if youre in school hes bored, youre just breathtakingly beautiful or well BOW CHICKA BOW WOW|`|KAXWo7Baaa	chances are he just likes you. hes happy to be with you but he wishes there was a little more between you two. i do that sometimes too|`|GB3iErEyaa	well personally.. i actually exhale a lot with a deep breath cause it feels good : / it could also mean that he feels comfortable with you|`|4qcXECiPaa	he likes you i do it after kissing my girlfriend, when im really happy|`|w4ZPcamlaa	Well im not a guy but im gonna answer, Im not to sure but maybe he sighs because he gets nerves before talking to u because he likes u.|`|722561d7c12f06d39d643393351ba989aa	You are a relief for him. Your a breath of fresh air for him.
Y6Vculsxaa	It all depends on why you got married and how the marriage was.  If you weren't inlove and didn't have a happy, loving marriage for the most part then I would say yes you feel older than what you really are.  As for the "decent" women you might just be looking into the wrong place or looking too hard for her.  Just relax live one day at a time and she will come around!!!  As for it taking more of a mental toll on you than what you thought it might have.  I have never been married so I really can't answer that.  But I don't think anyone can be prepared for a divorce.  Marriages are supposed to last forever.  Well that is my belief anyways.  Good luck to you sweetie.  And NO it isn't sad.  It is the way you feel, don't ever look down upon yourself for no one will look up to you!  Hold your head up high, you have just started your adventure!|`|AA10876010	Joe,    I hope you are not giving up! I think you got married to quickly.  Unless she is pregnant.  Actually, it goes both ways. It's hard for a woman to find a "decent" man as well.  Most men cheat and you will find quite a few are abusive.  Which narrows down to a few good men left in this world.  So, it's more diff for a woman to a find a decent man and it's easier for a man to find a good woman. Don't give up looking for one!|`|Ho15f0Joaa	You need time to re-collect yourself, not jump at the first looking promising relationship. Find yourself first. Don't put pressure on thinking you have to be in a relationship.    Give it some time. You will see more appealing ladies when your not expecting.|`|Yn14qm15aa	Hey joe! She must of broke your heart. :'( Don't worry you will find love. You feel a lot older because you've already done things in life that most people our age haven't even consider yet. You need to let her go and move on just don't try to hard cause it could hurt you in the end.
6jaybXHvaa	That all sounds very good. Don't be to hopless or let anybody disrespect you!! Take your time and get to know somebody befor you say the L word to! You will find somebody just be patient. Don't look in the wrong places either. Good Luck|`|AA11776726	awww your so sweet. no there is nothing wrong with that at all hun its what SO many girls are looking for because there aren't many guys like you left I envy the lucky girl that gets  to have you! your basically prince charming! what girl doesn't want a guy that will hold open a door for her and do the dishes with her? none of my boy friends ever did any of those things! I feel left out lol|`|BXKuxbg4aa	no its perfectly fine, i love the same things in a guy,but i have a bf, just wait and you'll meet another hopeless romantice out there, theres a lot  -hope this helps|`|zceoIsoraa	Its nothing wrong wit u.Don't worry,u'll find a love soon. well, a guy knowing how to do house chores is good for them u kno.  u can  b my fren if u wan|`|z1sM296saa	Wow,  you are impressive!      I say, most women ARE hopeless romantics (whether they admit it or not).  I  am. So, cheer up.  You are not alone.  There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with being one.  Just don't overdo it, ok?      Goodluck! May you find her..soon.
elhcuN19aa	Well tough one  the jobless one might be the one for you but timing may not be there for marriage yet...  Your mom wants what is good for you but you have the final say so in your life...  At least he is trying to find a job....  I had a woman who had 2 jobs and she still could not contribute to the relationship and cheated on me.....  A job does not mean they are responsible or not....  Dont judge the book by its cover...  Lets say the roles was reversed and you was in his shoes and his mom did not like you?  What would you want him to do?  I would have a heart to heart talk....  If you want to break up then tell him about it  If not then stick it out...  But I think you guys need a talk first.....|`|iD4ejChZaa	your mom is right, she's wiser than you, she wants a good future for you, i wouldn't waste my time with him if i were you.|`|AA11313204	dont even consider marriage untill he gets his **** together. untill then, if you are happy, you should stay together.|`|GRuIq6Igaa	You have been with him for a year and ahalf and he still hasn't found a job? He isn't serious.  Ask yourself this, could you live with him for the rest of your life with him not working or getting a job that last a couple of months and then he is unemployed again?   what if you bring kids into the picture?  Is he going to want to pull his weight and help you take care of them?  If he still doesn't have a job, then imagine what the kids will learn?|`|uReFjOONaa	dont even consider marriage untill he gets things together. untill then, you should stay together.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Thats a tough one. He has no motivation is sounds like. You cant get married with both people willing to put in the family bank there. You need to talk to him and tell him you're not settling down until you know its stable with money. Being broke is a big stress on relationships.|`|ykADw6ldaa	If he can leave his business or job for you. I think he can leave you for any other. Kindly think about enlarge your relation.and Liston what your mom want to say. she is your mother. not your daughter. She can better look what is the nature of  him.|`|q92ySEjkaa	Well then its easy, if he loves you just as much, he would want to commit, and when people commit, it means that in their minds they're considering a future with you.  Its good that you are questioning him but you should ask him straight forward how serious this relationship is to him.  When considering marriage you also need to consider buying a house, having your own transport, and also making provision for groceries and some other expenses for minor maintenance should something break or go wrong you need to be ready and able to handle it.  So if he's serious about you, you can now turn the tables back at him, and just very politely start chatting away about a house and furniture and making provision for a baby etc etc.  If he is still willing to make the commitment you can start chatting about who will be responsible for what as a marriage works both ways.  In my marriage my husband and I share all the expences, in fact my salary is paid into his account and we pay everything from their.  i usually have the debit card with me as I use it more than him for daily expences like bread milk etc.      And when you have discussed everything, you again very politly and not in an accusing tone ask him how does he mean to be a provider for a family wihtout a job.  Even while he's studying he could still get a part time job.  I know of people who has two part time jobs while studying.  My husband was working two jobs when I met him and will anyday do it again if we battle financially.|`|HlfgMoi4aa	dont marry him. he is looking for someone to take care of him. dont be that someone. tell him to get a job or else.   mildred is my leader
cj8iM1Olaa	Because we think we wont get caught.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	For exactly the same reason women do, however statistically men do it less.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	A man who is selfish cheats.    A man who really has little virtue or self-control cheats.    There could be alot of reasons.  There is no easy answer.  Some men just are jerks basically...they see a good looking girl that is attractive to them and even if they are married, they don't stop themselves because they lust after that other woman.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Not all men cheat and the ones that do lack respect for women and relationships in general.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	why are women so paranoid about this? thats the real question.  ha! i just did a typical stereotype about women just like what you did to men.|`|kgBQF4JXaa	same reason that woman do|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Not all do, some dont think of there girlfriends when they do.|`|HRovpOotaa	cant say men in general. if i ever had a girlfriend or a wife, i would never cheat. i think it's unfair.|`|vxIq4UcFaa	Cause we men get jealous & desperate, watching,!! desperate housewives!!|`|VMAhim63aa	i would never cheat|`|XQ7dg49Taa	I my self would never cheat but most men cheat for emotional reasons not just for sex. 85% of men who cheat find their spouse more attractive.|`|uUWdxKSWaa	WHY DONT YOU BiTCHES HAVE ANY THiNG ELSE TO TALK BOUT BE HAPPY DAMN|`|EsnFmcMFaa	because they dont know how to stay committed    if i had a gf or a wife  i would never cheat though|`|HA2GshmOaa	worst answer is ,because women get desses sexy everyday befor going to work ,,,,,think about it  high heel, short skirt ,push up brat   tignee half or quarter t shirt basicly u can see eveything throu  all that is in winter time ,,,,,,summer  time almost nothing on ,,,,,so whats up with that|`|TyApJBUIaa	cuz u women force us 2|`|t5lwrC9Caa	i don't cheat all the time, depends on what she looks like hehe|`|Bnj2ftpzaa	Why is it cheating? Is love just a game? and if so... who's the winner in the end???
zkLJZrgbaa	well maybe not ALL of u but MOST or almost a large percentage. I guess ur not like that and thats really gud :) but u know u should know som of ur friends or classmates..|`|OaxWErLraa	Prove it ;)|`|E8vMVB2zaa	i know|`|aHSWfH6zaa	hey i dont think all guys want is that ok a few do but the rest are really nice|`|AA11428585	i dont think that|`|WTREomdhaa	Well, basically, it is just being cautious.  It may be true that sex is not the only thing guys want.  But there are guys out there who only think that way.  We don't know you are not one of those guys until we get to know you.  So, just as a precaution, we might assume you are one of those guys.  Why do YOU think that ALL girls always think all guys want is sex.  See, you just did it too.  It is never ALL guys and it is never ALL girls, but you just never know.  Better to be safe than sorry.
1lATVNMJaa	she may just be having personal issues and just really want to talk them out with you, alone    or    she wants to take the relationship further    it would really help the people answering if you said how long you have been dating each other|`|8ea2ca56b7496258b9dcee6c2eaed438aa	Well, lets just say this. Go buy a family pack of condoms. Enjoy|`|1SliGcM1aa	well she either wants to brake up..or wants to go futher in yuor relationship..|`|eae7c12515f0c1723befd75e68cca0f3aa	not necessarily, specially if she let you know in advance that she doesnt want to break up, maybe she is going through some issues that she doesnt want anyone else to know about besides you. Good Luck! Hopefully is nothing to worry about.|`|R6UFCGvNaa	ooooooooook thats good sense she isnt gonna break up with you
R6UFCGvNaa	why do you want one i think they are so stupid and a waist of time and i think its dangerous to you will do way better with an e mail than a my space|`|vZADL4IVaa	I'm sorry to say, but I agree with your parents.  You'll be fine without a myspace account.  Go out and socialize with real people, in person.
b03a872739430753eeb5be93d86c7f25aa	Give her credit for being honest with you, and talk to her some more about it. I don't think I would say anything to your friend just yet until you decide for sure how you feel about what she's told you.|`|AA10116907	She probably doesn't understand your English.  Anyway, walk away from her.  You don't need to be with anyone who doesn't like being with you.|`|ab00deb13ab0a59bab7c3d1e4b368208aa	Dump her and yeah let him know, but if you dont want them hooking up you need to tell him that
aB3tACWtaa	Listen those words are unchangeable. Your going to have to ask her what does she want you to do because you can't read minds. Remember communication is the number one piece in a good relationship.
D9p2c5gKaa	You can't force him to talk to you... but you can trick him into doing so. Think about it. Maybe he likes that other girl and doesn't notice anyone else.. sorry =/|`|Lx9bVRGyaa	Try talking to him.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	catch him after class, and say hi and ask why he doesnt talk to you. joke about it a little like  for example: why dont you say to me its not like i bite or anything. be funny about it. or maybe like ask him about the class as if you didnt understand it play dumb lol you know be a girl!!!
X7i59NeIaa	Give yourself some time to do a little healing. You really have no idea how you will feel when everything is finally over. I definitely is not wrong for you to seek companionship, sex, love or all of these once you are divorced. Don't worry about the dating thing. When the time is right it will take care of it's self.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	No you are not wrong for wanting companionship. To me that's like wanting a best friend of the opposite sex and I think that's what you should look for before jumping into the dating romantic scene. Do you have hobbies or interests? Joining clubs for things that interest you or taking classes, either educational or for hobbies, are both good places to meet men who like the same things you do.You can also do volunteer work at a wide variety of   places and met like minded men there. It's typically much easier to meet decent men if they know you are not just looking for a husband and that anyone will do.If you don't met a man you'll still be doing something you look and maybe make some women friends, they can be a great source of comfort and understanding.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	I am all for trying to make a marriage work without divorce. Ask the Lord into your life and you will have a better outcome when it comes to marriage. Why would you want to throw away all those years? It's just so sad. I also feel you may be even more sad when you start to date and you find that you really do love your husband and wish he was there instead.|`|x8kzIerfaa	You should go on with your life and start dating never know you might find your true love give it a chance. I was with me ex husband for 12 years and 4 kids later and im divorced. And I have a fiancee and it like we are made for each other it amazing. go live your life for you   good luck
D8fcI0XTaa	try liking someone else get ur mind off her by talkin but not to much bc u don't wanna ignore her and lose her as a friend|`|5ss2Ok9saa	well if you are already in a relationship make that other girl realize that you are in one and that you care alot about this girl and you love her(herod you do) but if you like that other girl then just break up with your gf and go with that other girl . I am telling you now do not cheat its not worth it at the end cuz ppl lose trust in you so good luck and I hope u make the right decision.|`|fFnfFROQaa	Go out with other women.    The mistake most people forget is that until you are BF-GF, you can date as many you want simultaneously.    When you date many, you have a choice to see which ones you want too pursue and which ones you want to keep as pals....you will be too busy to be liking one person over the next one.|`|vzLaDHSlaa	don't show any attention towards the person whom u want to ignore............................  have a nice day|`|AA11441704	change your mind.............b/c you can't change the environment.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	you have 2 options:    1. Wait out their relationship, if it fizzles, go for her    2. Accept the fact that she's not yours but continue to be friends with her|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	Change your habits. Do different things outside of class, take another route through campus, go to things on varying nights. If you don't try to change how you see the person nothing will ever happen to help you. Or ... you could face it and deal with the feelings. Getting over someone is hard and sometimes impossible to do so just stay positive and make alternating daily choices.|`|uUWdxKSWaa	just dont say anything keep it movin|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	Wait patiently ...|`|91AMtKEraa	Slap her in head and say dont look at me no more have a nice day|`|22hX0vDNaa	just ignore the person. it works, trust me.|`|RQABJGfLaa	uh just totally do NOT look at her and look for other girls its almost impossible not to see a hot girl
1eKiTA6qaa	looks matter a little if not a lot.....and humor most important thing...if you have a sense of humor you can win over any girl...and a little caring nature...|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Yes,Looks matter.But if you can strike up a good  conversation and can make a girl laugh...the possibilities  are endless.The only advice i can give you is to take care  of yourself physically,dress to impress,and be self confident,  smile and remember if a girl likes you for your looks alone  shes not worth your time anyway...be you and love it!|`|2XTkSV4daa	Well most importantly, he has to have fun and be able to laugh at himself and just joke around and make me laugh too. It helps if he's cute but that's not the most important thing as long as he makes me feel special and we have fun together.|`|b3AUCeqaaa	Well looks matter a little I guess well we don't want sum1 ugly I mean would u like a ugly girl;anyway girls always like funny caring and nice guy.  hope that answers ur ?|`|PTwgXnauaa	The most important thing is respect for her...you would truly love her only if you respect her. By respecting i mean, respect for her values and thinking..girls are very pure and sensitive they would be ready to do anything for you if you give them love and respect that they deserve|`|54f4721ccf359bec18327f26ddcbb78caa	I think attraction matters more than looks. Second would be personality.
OLATihVpaa	I would not say that one sex has more of a sex drive than another.     Every woman has an ideal condition(a certain feeling derived from a verbal, mental, emotional. etc, etc. stimulation) which causes her to want to be intimate.     I m not a man, but from one woman's point of view, men appear to me as that they really want to be intimate, which stimulates them in a mental, emotional, or some other way.    We have to learn about each other individually, not only by if we are male or female.  It's very in depth and can be confusing and complicated.  But like any subject that we are really interested in learning about, you have to do your homework and you have to study.  After a few years or more of knowing a person, you can push the right buttons that have always worked before and they don't work. You have to figure out why. I hope this answers your question.|`|JEteneuUaa	deped if you good hunter or not.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Yes, studies show they do. Because of male hormones.    These are the reasons why some women lack sexual drive. (The American Medical Association)      Anaemia, which is very common in women because of iron loss during periods.      Alcoholism.      Drug abuse.      Major diseases such as diabetes.      Post-baby coolness, a term coined for the loss of libido that often happens after childbirth. It is linked to hormonal changes that occur at this time. The general trauma of childbirth also plays a part - and after having a baby, many women are too exhausted to think about sex.      Prescribed drugs, particularly tranquillisers.      Hyperprolactinaemia - a rare disorder in which the pituitary gland is overactive.      Other hormone abnormalities: leading Swiss gynaecologist Dr Michael Nemec claims that abnormalities in the production of luteinising hormone (LH) often cause lack of desire. And top British gynaecologist John Studd says that many women who have lost their libido lack androgenic (male) hormones. This view remains controversial.    for more sources check this out: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relations...|`|1VVJphsAaa	Because men are hunters.|`|edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	are u kidding, women are ten times hornier than we are.|`|XS3PexPIaa	No, but women have more control over this. Women are more emotional than men though.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Not really, men just are more expressive about it and are quicker to talk about it to others.    I always thought we were more sexual driven, but the more you observe actions of the opposite sex (example being a girlfriend) the more you see if you even arouse them the slightest bit it's on.|`|1kSRPadaaa	HELL NO|`|w4ZPaxsbaa	Here it is: sex is the driving force of men: relationship is the driving force of women.  Look back on the great men and women of history and mythology: there you will see examples of this. For example, Helen of Troy (He wanted/desired her so much that he destroyed an entire city to posses her), Napoleon, conquered countries for his wife Josephine, Joan of Arc (she wanted unity, freedom and relationship for her people, Queen Elizabeth-the Virgin Queen- had forsaken a sexual relationship with men for a noble and selfless relationship with her people:England.    Now, as to sexual drive per se, each person is different. Generally as a group, during certain periods of their lives, a man's sexual peak occurs during his teens; whereas a woman's sexual peak may occur in her late twenties to early thirties.
H6gjOGnGaa	Find some excuse to spend time with him.  Do it often.

m06TDTtTaa	Well for one thing he is not a boy anymore he is a man.  and you are still a minor. he would get into trouble.  the age difference in a couple of years wont make a difference.|`|SNaxiArHaa	Some will say it is bad and some won't. I don't think it is because I'm 17 and my boyfriend just turned 26. We met when I was 16 and he was 23. Do what your heart tells you to and don't make it to public.|`|9GUuVYinaa	exactly! in 2 years it won't be so bad, so wait that way he won't get in trouble for being with you too!|`|UsojaTuuaa	legally if you have sex with him, he could be charged with rape. personally i dont think the age gap is that bad, and you are right that 18 and 22 doesnt sound bad, but i just am wondering his intentions for dating a girl who is considered a minor.  its a big risk.     maybe you are mature and he is too, or most likely he has the maturity of a 16 year old so i guess it makes sense|`|DnJXafIwaa	your doing a miley cyrus ewwwwwww|`|kpPOzMpeaa	you have a good point.  just wait til you're older to become really intimate with eachother or you could get into trouble very easily.  by the way..age is just a number, love is love.  =)|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	That sounds like a good age diffrence it is ok! my stepsister is 15 and i think her boyfriend is like 17!|`|bgtNYOp5aa	You are a minor, and he can go to jail and it is illegal. Sorry|`|4dXcZhuTaa	right now, it is bad... been there, i know how this goes.  when you are 18 it's not as bad.. but you aren't 18 and he is 20....  it's bad news, it really is|`|F5gtYbDVaa	NONONNONONONONON, its not bad..  awwww, this question made me smile haha.. hopefully its love, i wouldnt get into that trouble if their was only a like factor.  dont listen to anyone whos saying its bad!...unless you just wanna **** him or something, haha.|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	Whenever I was 16, I was dating my boyfriend... and he was 19 going on 20. So I guess I can't say it's bad. Our relationship has been going strong since then. I'm 17 (18 in a few months) and he's 21.     It's not bad, just don't do anything sexual... because he can get in trouble. Or, you can do whatever the hell you want, and not tell anyone. Whatever floats your boat. It's your love life, our opinions shouldn't matter.|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	nah its straight|`|gRsuXxkbaa	well wait til ur 18 then|`|vQmb8XZPaa	nah thats a great difference for a creeper.. thats wonderful... then he can be ur stalker guy too.. and wait in bushes and stuff..  good luck|`|AX3DQw3Paa	I don't think so, but then again I date a lot of older guys.... Anyways...you have to see if it's ok with your parents. If they agree to it, I'd expect chaperones. But anyways...it's a four year age difference...wow...BIG SHOCKER! *cough* The only problem is that you guys could get in trouble if you had sex or if your parents got mad and decided to say you had sex. Be careful.|`|LHhds2tQaa	I think its pushing it. But thats just me. But when your 18 its not as bad.|`|oQPwnYDwaa	just don't hoop up with him... your a minor and that would get him in trouble!!    i believe that age shouldbn't stand in your way though!! if you really like him!!|`|kWdlfnQqaa	illigal|`|21bV1zXBaa	it's like totally illegal.|`|zhBCBTSiaa	haha, 'nah its straight'    basically. Just be careful, don't let him get into any trouble. I think the age is not bad. There's nothing "bad" about an age difference. It's how you feel about each other and what your intentions are. In fact, my aunt is in a relationship with someone 9 years older and they have kids and live happy. It's all good as long as he's respctful to you, and you have good intentions.    :)|`|QViOLwAVaa	well, am 19,   when i was 14-15 i felt in love with this guy, he was 21 and he was so nice and so kind to me, he was my first boyfriend, kiss and everything.  but for experience i know that old guys just want sex from little girls...    but my advice is to be carefull, look at him, if he talk about sex all day, he just want that, but if he respect u go on,   just used protection and becareful... old guys are evil to me...    i dont think is bad, is just that men are so different from us.. and they love hurting young girls|`|vk7xovK4aa	It's completely not bad! I support you all the way, in some places 14-16 year-old's are allowed to date any age.. even marry them.. but I guess you're suppose to respect your dad's wishes and the legal rules of your country.. You seem like a very.. very matured girl.     I hope you're successful all the way with your future boyfriend!    Bye...
FVDTXM68aa	It wouldn't hurt to meet back up with your ex, that is if he feels the same way. For now, take some time to focus on you and clear your head. Obviously you are not quite over your ex (which is fine...things like this take time). If you truly care for your ex and want to give it another shot, do it! Never give up on someone you love! Don't worry about the other guys for now. Take everything one day at a time! :) Hey, follow your heart and live with no regrets! If things work out between you and your ex, great!! If not, then at least you followed your heart and you won't wonder "what if." Good Luck, sweetie!! :)|`|bgWfcplBaa	I think you should wait until you are over your ex until you start dating.  If you start dating before then, you will still pine for your ex while you are dating a new guy.|`|B94Xi3gtaa	he's your ex for a reason|`|O716Z3HRaa	I say wait, and then go from there. You'll have some kind of closure when your ex returns because if you jump into a relationship and you're not ready for it, it'll end up hurting the guy.|`|hH0ts3DDaa	well it really all depends if you want to make your relationship work this time or not. if you do, go ahead and try to pursue that, but if you're not willing to, i hear the best way to completely get over your ex is to cut off all contact with him, and on avg. it takes about 6 months to get over them most completely. it seems that you really like him though, go for it :]|`|A4OM6nI9aa	nope definitely dont wait for him...move on...im going through the same thing and thinking of him totally doesnt help how you feel...you just end up feeling confused and he probably is over you...you dont have to start dating so soon just dont go running to him...and dont go having random sex with these guys until you know that you wont feel slutty afterwards and make you think of your ex even more...try to have fun with it tho ;)|`|aEonduUUaa	Ur ex probably already has a gf|`|EmK9GMI0aa	Just wait it out if you really want him that bad you seem to care lots!
Z4PxfObXaa	Um... don't be their friend anymore.  It's not that hard.  Just don't be friends with them.  Find people who will not talk behind your back, because people who do are not your true friends.  And you cannot continue being friends with them, hoping things will change, because people never change.  If these girls like to gossip, they will always like to gossip.  It's not worth it so just move on.|`|7e9105250e216e6f1ae0dde9f25dd1c6aa	My advice to you is that you should tell them that its the wrong thing to do and everyone is not perfect except God.And if they dont care who cares at least you will be blessed from God and they will have a punishment.|`|wiJBZrS2aa	you should confront them about it|`|vwoqIUR6aa	start making fun of them...honestly they aren't good friends. get rid of them|`|IcBdShB1aa	Sounds like you have some crappy friends. Get new ones|`|1FAggU5Zaa	nothing..... its just what middle skool or high which ever u are..    u talk s.h.i.t on them 2 so who cares when u graduate from high skool ur never gooing to see them again... plus use them as friends as they use u|`|SY5JQX69aa	try to make SURE they were talking about someone behind their back first    then ask them why && see how they respond.    just talk it out.
8mR3Kchnaa	dude chill out....you're like me im very sensitive too maybe thats why i get angry quickly....friends coming and leaving its all part of life...its hard to find good friends..dont worry be patient...dont give up and dont lose ur trust...just dont think about it too much...one day youll find someone very special and you'll remember.......|`|StmuM9wHaa	It is nothing Chaitu K, it happens. I don't have so many friends, only a few. I don't know who u r and what u r, but i think, U have a definite mind. Take help of that definite mind. Engage yourself with some social organisations of like minded people, if there is no such any, then u can organise yourself, to deliver some social goods like awareness programmes on environment, pollution, global warming etc. etc.and sooooo on n on. Have friends of like mindeds, it will certainly do good atleast to some extent. I m a cool but a positive thinker, that is why I have only a few friends, ofcourse I m to some extent choosy. But I m a very happy married and social person. So don't worry, do your works in your own capacity, u need not to search for any friends, they will come to u seeking your friendship.    To keep yourself busy in your leisure you can opt for reading books. In my opinion books should b our best friend. So forget those friends, do your own works, life is yours, selfish friendship can do nothing it can create so many problems only. So b with u and your family. But as a social animal we need friends, but not friendships with all of them, so keep in touch with all, but.... you will know better. Keep smiling always- get going with yahoo friends- I found this very very interesting world of friends n friendships-
KY3o5T5Daa	If u r handsome, it is then piece of cake. Just help them, talk with them and finally you will reach it.|`|8bETrOtqaa	Just be yourself, and hang out with different style of girls, and whoever you connect more with then go for her|`|5YFgZCEKaa	good looking boys with good physique and Intelligent mind have more chances|`|59CaFeS8aa	Make all the girls in ur school as ur friends. Do not confuse with the kind of stories ur frnds may tell. Half of them cld be fantacys.  and those falling for them and worrying over are fools.    Time to seek a good career or future.    Good and smart girls are not scarce anywhere. Just make urself eligible to be bid by trhem. One day you would wonder how foolish you were over this.    Just enjoy, dream a lot, have  alot of friends, and many of them girls without barriers and grow up.    best wishes|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	I thing you are not going there for making girlfriend you can do this in after schooling.|`|TPXlAxe2aa	Make sure she is someone you really like then take the initiative of making her like you and cherish your time together...like this maybe one day you can ask her out
H9aJNEAQaa	You may have broken his heart, but you also helped your friend.  You did something big.  If I were u i would apologize to the man & stop there.  You did a good thing and don't be mad @ yourself.  Write the man an apology letter or e-mail.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	You did what you think was the best for a friend. That should be enough.|`|yv91B1iqaa	You did the right thing. Although it may be though for the guy, you cant force your friend to like the guy.|`|h31I5hSAaa	you did the right thing if your friend likes it.|`|6MOn3H8Yaa	talk to her. One feeling are their own. We can match and make but one heart might need time to heal and understand.|`|d6Y7zg0caa	It seems as if there is no fool proof way to handle this..... but due to the circumstances..... i'm sure the guy could understand on some level if he is respectful to her culture..... so i believe you did something good.|`|f92f4c895d75cb0a24f4ea612297712eaa	tell her
y4SUDnpaaa	Are you serious? Of course it's inappropriate to spend months with another woman, especially when you will be together with her 24/7 in places where no one would ever know for sure if this 'friendship' turned into a month of cheating. Find a guy friend to go with. Put yourself in her place would you want her to go off hiking with a guy for months. How much more temptation could you possibly put yourself  in?|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Go for it, as long as you understand you'll probably end up f**king.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	bot knocking for sure, go for it|`|VrR9ojRRaa	Depends if you want the sister or not.    If there is no reason for your g/f to be jealous then there shouldnt be a problem!|`|C46DNX11aa	No, it will never work, eventually your gf will get jealous or you and the sister will get a little too chummy. Invite two or three others to come along with the two of you ,I am sure that you can find someone else because if you don't then. it is best for you to join your gf at the Hilton and Starbucks.|`|iD4ejChZaa	oh pleeeze  of course not|`|Ov4RVYa7aa	She would have to really trust you.  I wouldn't be comfortable for my boyfriend going on a long hike alone with my sister.  Maybe you could get some friends to go with you.|`|H5OKhz0Faa	Be careful not to let in unnecessary temptation.    That being said, if you both think it's a great idea find a couple other people to join you.  Make sure your girl friend is really okay with the whole idea first.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	u have more in common with your gf  then dont go with that girl on the hike    i would stay with you gf|`|3VudB9uuaa	I would not be happy if my b/f went on a hike with my sister for months.  Mind you, I don't have a sister, so it's a bit hard for me to answer objectively, however if it was a good friend of mine, then I wouldn't be comfortable with it.  And I'm definitely not a jealous type of girl.  It's the length of time alone with another female that I don't feel happy about.|`|UyULJUx1aa	Why are you dating the one you have nothing in common with? If you do this hoke with the sister, it will be over between you and your gf, because if that doesn't make her jealous then she's not into you. And that would probably be good. Ever considered dating someone who actually has things in common with you?|`|Bzb6rSeCaa	It sounds like maybe you like the sister more the your gf.   The thing to you need to realise is unless you are really really loyal and madly in love with your gf there is a good chance that you will end up hooking up with her sister. To spend months away with someone especially when there is not going to be anyone else around, you will end up becoming close to the other person because you will be together all the time day and night and you will be each others only company. You will probably have to talk to your gf about this before you chose to go because if she is sitting at home for months waiting for you to come back and in the meantime you have replaced her with her own sister then she is going to be really p*ssed.  Im sure you know all the things that could happen, you really need to think hard about this and talk about it so no one gets hurt!!|`|AA11391968	I think it will cause problems.|`|r8aEwUBUaa	ALL WRONG.     if you are trying to break up with your girlfriend then go ahead
a9xITT0Aaa	She Still Has Feelings For You  I Usually Do That If I Think The Guy I Like  Is Gonna Say He Lieks Someone Else.  I Just Rather Not Hear It From Him    So Yeah She Likes You :]    Edit: She Asked You In The First Place   Because She Thought You Moved On   BUT She Still  Had A Light Of Hope   That You Liked Her.I Say You Admit   You Like Her Before You Lose Her.    Edit: Maybe You Can Ask Her Out On A Date  Or Just Hang Out With Her More And Hint  That You Like Her... In Other Words Flirting  Then You Can Ask Her Who She Likes.  She Doesn't Wanna Answer? Be Like..  "Because Who Ever It Is, Is Sure A Lucky Guy"  Or Something Like That.|`|89lEF1bwaa	she still likes you deep down... ask her if shes seeing anybody|`|XfjoDHo2aa	well you just need to get to the point and tell her that its her your waiting for instead of playing games short and sweet get to the point and you will have a better relationship.|`|koXcq0l1aa	That's not the smartest answer you could have given her.  Now she thinks that you like someone else and not her.      You really need to tell her eventually that it's her you were referring to.|`|b8LM28bVaa	You should have never said that. She can't stand the fact that you moved on, she was testing you. Don't plan on her to be there in your future.|`|uUWdxKSWaa	Y'ALL STILL WANT EACH OTHER GO FOR IT DONT MISS YOUR CHANCE THAT COULD BE THE LOVE OF YOU LIFE GOOD LUCK|`|gRsuXxkbaa	she may have picked up on what u meant and isnt feeling the same way|`|cxM8pSbdaa	She likes you...  and wants to be yours again...  She asked to see if there could be any chance to reconcile it, and actually she wants "no" to be your answer.  And since she is hurt by the thought of you wanting someone else for the future hurts her.  And so to hide that she is hurt, she changes the topic...    You must let her know it was she that you meant..  That was so sweeeeettttt.... : )|`|duupRLplaa	changing the subject or avoiding the question when it comes to her might mean that she's lonely. When she asked you she could have been "just asking" but she might want to know how you're doing now.|`|b82ybE3gaa	A) She is seeing someone else too, but wants to make sure that it wouldn't hurt things further with you (I'm betting this one since she didn't answer you the first time)    B)She might want to stop relations with you if she sees its hurting you because you don't want to find someone else (i don't really see it as this one but if you're having sex its possible.)    or    C) She still likes you and wants to get back with you     Apparently you still have feelings for her, So I hope its the third one, but I always asked if I was seeing someone new, or I wanted to have a completely friends with benefits relationship.|`|lsFDEx2oaa	That means either she cares or she's trying to keep tabs on you.  Don't answer with a direct yes or no.  Just brush it off and tell her that if she wants another chance with you she has to take a number.      Or tell her that if she wants to ask you out that you'll take it under advisement.      Don't tell her you have someone in the future, she might think its someone else and try to get another guy just to spite you.  You obviously want her back, she probably wants you back.  Don't give her false impressions.|`|LMpHQ5A7aa	just tell her that pu***|`|BkatcMZbaa	It means she know and want to avoid the commitment at the moment.  There is still a chance as she didn't refuse your indication.  That means she still can wait, no hurry.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	go for it
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	just tell her that possibly he doesn't want to be with her.. (emphasis on the word possibly)    ask her to talk to him..    or ask her to detach herself from him..    or to do the same as her bf is doing to her...
5kIaWKi8aa	You could do an open invitation to dinner. Or you could just serve appetizers and drinks at after the cemermony and then just do an intimate dinner with just your husband, parents and his parents.     I don't think there would be anything wrong with people paying for their own meal as long as they know ahead of time. It would probably go off better if your family is close. (My family would be fine, but my husband's would flip.)    I would also suggest if you have people pay, don't really expect gifts.|`|NU8Z0Rulaa	Generally speaking, it is rude to ask a wedding guest to pay for anything. There's all this nonsense about cash bars and stuff. Don't listen to it. This is a little bit different than having a dinner reception at some swanky hotel ballroom where guests don't really have the option to pay for their own. Invite your guests to join you, but don't make them feel obligated.    A great alternative would be to have a picnic or potluck with the family. Everyone can bring a dish and you can party in the backyard with everyone!|`|AA11704353	awwww I don't know... some people will be fine but some night get offended!!!!!!   I mean let the people know if they want to pay then they will go... Good Luck|`|gt5Zdy1uaa	Talk to one of your parents maybe and have them spread the word for you. Also most times people get money for their wedding so that is also a possibility. But i would just tell a family member or 2 to relay the message to the rest. good luck.|`|2SZ3RZEaaa	As you are inviting people to the ceremony tell them about going out to eat.  Just explain that you would love to have them join you but you understand if financially they are unable to do so.  Thank them for coming to the ceremony.  Don't make it seem like it is mandatory.
ggia15Sbaa	You have the exact same problem as me! Word for word! I find that I'm not the person that anyone thinks of when they do anything even though I'm very friendly and try to initiate conversations. Rarely does anyone come up to me and talk. I have to talk to others.    I think we just need more confidence and need to hang with people after class or work. Follow them around (not stalking though) and not just separate and do your own thing. Stop making excuses like: "I have work to do" or "I'm tired".    On the first week of classes, I pretty cool guy actually asked me if I was going home so we could take the subway together, but I made an excuse and said I was busy. I really regret it! Now the guy has his own friends...    I hope you get this problem solved because I know how it feels to be living this lonely life : ]|`|A6kT2j9Uaa	You have zero confidence yet you constantly talk about yourself.    Slow down and speak less when people expect more. And speak more when people are not expecting much.|`|YdD200a6aa	Initiate conversations more often, and if you're going out (say miniature golfing, bowling, or to the movies), ask some of the people you're trying to evolve friendships with to come with you.    Also, don't be afraid to open yourself up a bit. Talk about your interests and try to find a common ground with them. Showing off your sense of humor (you do have one, right?) never hurt, either ;)|`|AA10503158	You can't connect with just anyone and everyone. Don't give up ;)  When you find people you really like, hang out with them, make a  bond. Share your secrets, only if you can fully trust them. G/L?
nTHPm17xaa	You can go to SearchAllDeals.com, search the stuff as "baby products ", "clothing", "toys " etc.  You also can add "printable coupon" in the search term, if you want to use the coupon in store. I did some search for you here:    baby products:  http://searchalldeals.com/deals/search?c...    toys:  http://searchalldeals.com/deals/search?c...    Hope this is useful for you.|`|mX27tszPaa	There are tons of websites that you can use to do this.  Really, the best place to start looking is on the manufacturer websites because they offer some real specific ones.  After that you can check coupon websites, just Google coupons and a ton will come up.  You can also fill out a survey or join an email list, and from there those places will often email you coupons.  Below is a link to an eHow article that tells you how to get Olay coupons but the process is basically the same for all coupons.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4752117_get-olay...    Hope this helps some, and good luck!!!
mHZvOhsDaa	ive never heard of it being done.. lol sorry man its basically the death trap for us all, i feel your pain, your probably like me, the guy who is sensative and doesnt screw around with girls, dont slap them on the butt or call them sexy or use provocative words. your probably the guy who listens and cares. the good way to be.. im like that at least :)    but uh, maybe if you have a big roll in her friendship, ignore her, i mean totally ignore her, dont initiate anything so she will wonder where you are AND THEN maybe she will realize how her life isnt as good with you not their and maybe reconsider.. at least thats 1 way to get her to start thinking about you.    worst case scenario she just wants to be friends and you should cherish that and date someother girls.. i know its rough, been there done that like every other guy, your not the first.|`|0Z4tqTIMaa	you cant... absolutely NO HOPE!!! sorry buddy, give it up.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	The minute u get stuck in friend zone, you are basically stuck there for years till they want a "good" bf.|`|5jMNBO2naa	it's not going to happen  she stuck you their for a reason  you represent comfort and security right now  something she likes and needs  you will notice she will go for all the wrong guys  and then come back to you to cry on  all the while complaining why can't she have a guy like you    so you see the hypocrisy in all of it don't you    the funny thing is you pull back a bit  and start dating other girls  she might actually try to snag you herself|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	I was there forever...throughout highschool.We had our fun but never got a real relationship cause he was worried we'd lose our bond if anything bad happened. It's sad but I still sometimes wish we worked out cause now I still find myself thinking about it. He's been out of my life for 6 years now ......Good luck.|`|iWUKgUwHaa	I've been great friends with a guy who wants more,but I could NEVER be more than a friend to him.I personally don't ever put a guy in the"friend zone",unless I know I could never be with him.Everybody is different though.It depends on how long you've known them etc..Some of the best relationships are made from the best of friends!Good luck!|`|O1WxKk7uaa	just start dating her be romantic on the dates just take it slow though|`|8551IHm0aa	Once you're in, you stay in|`|8YNLZp5Faa	why don't you try not hanging out with your "friend" so much so she can get away from the idea of always having you around for a friend..  then after a bit of time, you can try hanging out with her on different terms|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Dude, i'm like getting there. I got the "Brother" speech, but i mean its the same thing as a friend. Can't say ive made it out yet, but im almost sure i am about to. It's been almost half of year, of trying. Like at first, you have to make them know that you are a good friend by acting like yall are still cool even after the rejection. Then, you hang out with her more, then she'll like you even more(as a friend). After that, you drop the "friend" act, and they will want to know why you "Dont talk like you used to". Then, you have a really long talk about your feelings, and about how you cant see her as a friend no more. And you put your game face on, and keep going. Then, one day make your move, an she should follow along.    Lol. Hope this helps. Its an outline of the past six months for me. Most importantly make her smile, because she'll realize that you make her happy.|`|O716Z3HRaa	It just takes too long to get out of, I've tried it and gave up. You have to represent yourself as not the safety and the security that she seeks, as crazy as that may sound. She put you in the friend zone so that she will have that safety and security. I say move on and find another girl cause it'll be too much stress to go through that, trust me I tried it.|`|XchMS5o3aa	I'm sorry to say this dude but your stuck there... I'm talking out of experience... Sorry...|`|gRsuXxkbaa	there is never any escaping the friend zone|`|b82ybE3gaa	So as a girl i wanna say that it has happened...to a friend of mines brother, I don't think it will ever happen with me. But he was friends with this girl for years and years and she went to all the other guys first and finally came back to him, I think they are still dating.     Not all "friend Zones" are impossible to break out of, it just depends on the girl. I have a guy friend who will only be my guy friend, I don't think I can ever imagine getting intimate with him and that's important to me, which is something I think most girls have a problem with, you just don't think about kissing and loving your best friend like that.     I think you should just tell her how you feel, something like "I really appreciate being with you, and I believe that we could make it as more than just friends, but I understand if your not ready for that with me, and I'll be here for you as your friend no matter what."     that way it tells her that you've entertained the idea of being with her,  but  you also understand if she hasn't. Its quite probable that she will think on that and might actually try to think of you more as well.|`|BZg5TFlqaa	well if u keep doin what ur doin the ur effing screwed for life!!!  first! STOP GIVING THE VIBE OF A FRIEND. i know ur not doin it on purpose andu r being nice and stuff but stop! we girls precieve that as we are only goin to be friends cus thats what ur "telling" us. we mix up ur guys signals all the time. haha  ok here is what u do. believe me i gotten out of the friend zone plenty of times.  after u stop giving the nice friendly vibe then one day or a few ( ur choice really) dont speak to her dont even try to be around her unless u have to be uh more quiet and keep to urself.  after that when u see her wrap ur arms around her waist ( or neck) and give her a big tight hug. and be really happy and flirty and talkative but not annoying ok?  then call/ text to her more. get to know her more. like as personal questions (but not too personal) like question like so what are u thinking bout right now. or play the 20 question game. be like wow im bored. wanna play a game? be flirty with that game. i garauntee shell be flirty back :) haha and of course if ur textin add some wink faces now and then ;)  be flirty and sexy. but not too much tho cus u dont want her to think that u only what her body or something k? also stare at her. look at how beautiful she is. mainly look at her face and lightly smile but ur eyes can trail up and downward if u like. ;)  touch her more. like if u guys are uh walking to class grab her hand and tell her that ull walk her to class once u met her destination then hug her.  after a few days of touching her then dont touch her as much. let her want to give u hugs and stuff. if she doesnt do that then go back to the flirtiness and touching the revert back to touching her less. once she starts touching or hugging u and stuff the ur IN!!! she likes u. and u can be alot more flirty and ur conversations will be a little bit more sexy and fun :)  and maybe shell be ur gf soon :D    hoped it helped!!!

Go to a swapmeet, because pink heels are not going to be in season right now because it's winter but the swapmeet always has random stuff. (and cheep)  Also you should go to a DSW shoe warehouse, they always have random stuff in wierd colors, I'm sure you can find pink.  Or look in the phonebook for a little wedding store, they should have them in all colors because people go for specific colors for their bridesmaids/wedding colors etc...  Ross and Marshalls should have some cheap colorful shoes, they always have wierd colors when I go....|`|v9KkatxAaa	Have you checked out Piperline.com?  They have free returns.

POFdWpUzaa	You 2 definitely need help. The fact that he would leave like that and leave not only you but his two kids just boggles my mind. Think of the kids, they deserve better than this. He needs to grow up and come home, you need to grow up and be a supportive wife and mother, and you 2 need to get help to learn how to be a responsible married couple with kids.|`|6Oprylquaa	Take a few weeks for yourself, he has you should as well. Sometimes it takes TIME to gain a proper perspective on things. Try going to a club he frequents with some friends and see if maybe he has been going just because he enjoys it. Think about yourself for alittle while, if he is still interested he will come back and by then you can make a choice based on facts not just impulses and emotions. If he really loves you and cares to be with you he will be hurt that your not upset over the situation like you so clearly are right now. If he does appear to talk be careful not to anger each other and it will be easier to talk about things. Goodluck!|`|chZFmJOPaa	9 years and he's doing this? You need to call him and ask him if the relationship is worth working on or not. He might just need his own time, but going to clubs? What is he doing there. He might just be getting out with his friends but that might not be it.     You just need to talk to him. If he doesnt want the relationship anymore, think of it this way. You deserve better and its good you found out how committed he was to your family sooner than later.
qeUoAW6naa	I suggest you give him some time. Btw, why did you kick him out? Just coz he didn't pay you attention (not sure what kind of attention you mean) doesn't mean you should kick him out!! What a horrible wife! Have you ever wondered if something was probably on his mind or bothering him at the time? Anyway, I'm pretty sure he's really upset with you and is trying to get his life back on track, and that's why he is chilling and having fun. What is stopping you from having fun with your friends? Just continue apologising to him and promising that this won't happen again. Keep that promise. And give it time. See if he returns.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Do the two of you fight like this often? He is making you pay for kicking him out. You need to take a deep breath and then take an honest look at yourself. What kind of wife and mother are you? Do you need to make a few changes? If so start working on yourself. Don't beg him to come back but do ask him to sit down and talk to you about the situation. Tell him exactly how you feel and that you really want him to come home. Tell him that you are sorry for your juvenile behavior because from what you have said here I think you are sorry. Tell him that you love him and miss him and that you will try very hard to do better and then follow through. Good luck|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Clubbing isn't the reason he doesn't want to come home....      ....YOU ARE.       He is sick of your attitude. He's sick of your victim hood. He's sick of how you've been treating him.    You got into an argument and kicked him out....on your ANNIVERSARY?!    He is at a club to get drunk and have fun and forget that his wife is so cruel, so mean, and so self centered....that he is done trying to take care of her.    Your ability to turn this whole thing into his fault is really amazing. Have you ever given him a single thought....how horrible he must be feeling right now?|`|8DDK2K5baa	you kicked him out    you are full of yourself    your fault    my advice?    stop asking strangers on the internet|`|28c9eb0b801c2374bd219860f12425b9aa	TAKE A DEEP BREATH!     Now realize that until you see him at the club think on it as "hear say" but by all means find out for yourself!    If he is then ask him straight out if he wants a divorce that should wake him up if he still in love with you.  You should never do things in direct retalication for 2 very good reasons    1) it impulsive and can cause more trouble in your marriage then you can handle.    2) Think about the opportunity, to improve your marriage by making positive choice for your family not just yourself!    Your a MOTHER and you have to be able to watch your children grow up and not a sword over your head waiting to come down on you.    THIS CAN NOT BE EASY ON THEM EITHER SO BOTH OF YOU NEED TO ACT LIKE ADULTS, SCRATCH THAT AS PARENT"S FOR THERE SAKE!|`|5jMNBO2naa	most good guys will not leave their wife and kids behind  but will from an insecure and needy women who harangues them all the time  i am sure you even started tearing into his self image and emasculating him in front of the kids  therefore he said no more, got his brass back, and left you and the kids|`|0AShsMsoaa	divorce busting by michele davis, and relationship rescue by dr phil.     do not go out.  do not cry to him.  be calm.  could you both go to marriage counseling?  i hope so.  good  luck.|`|R9CkkXXgaa	o thats not good talk to him and tell him how you feel|`|yFKP8f0Aaa	first of all the reason why he wanted out is so he can do what a bachelor guy can do. i know for a fact that he is enjoying every moment of his life out there and not even thinking about his family. i say don't you even worry about it. let him realize he would loose and he will pay child support for two kids plus alimony so let him have his laughs and fun now and you will be doing the same laughs later on..    cheer up its not the end of the world yet, there's plenty of guys out there. he is just a man well not technically, his a jerk and you and your kids dont deserve all the hurt and pain. he will come crawling back to you. just ignore him for now suck it up be strong, and you will win this battle, you'll se|`|1o3OqSioaa	It sounds like the relationship was already over when you kicked him out. When you kicked him out, you just gave him permission to leave without any of the guilt that he would have felt by leaving on his own accord. Using tears and guilt now won't work that he's had a taste of freedom. Your best chance is to act as if you are having the time of your life, and not be too obvious about it, or he'll figure out that you are faking it. Ask him to babysit because you have plans to go out with your girlfriends to the clubs, have lunch dates with friends, or go shopping. Make sure you always look your best when he's around. Act confident, and a little superior to him, it will drive him nuts, if he still cares. Remain aloof, and play hard to get, and never beg or be clingy. That is a sure fire turn way to drive any man off.|`|PxMUrQODaa	i have been married 16 yrs and 2 years ago my husband started going out with his friends every other friday, he would smell like beer and be moody with me and pay no attention to me. i would ask him where he would go and he never wanted to tell me, im pretty sure he went clubbing with his friend, this went on for two years. so i started goingout with my sister and friends, and i behaved myself, i would come home late just like him, he didnt like it. My husband stopped going out with his friends because i told him that if he didnt stop i wanted a divorce, but we are still married.  So i think you should keep doing the same thing, but if he doesnt come back in 2 months that means he doesnt care. hes probably cheating on you. i think you should divorce

5WB2yZUFaa	my sister's son is autistic. he has his good days and his bad ones. have you tried being super friendly with her son? it may sound silly, but you could try bringing him a little present. i won my nephew over with (inexpensive) toy cars. they are a special kind of people, and they should be treated that way. but your friend shouldn't allow him to treat you badly. if she put a little effort into it, she could teach her son right from wrong. he's not stupid, he's autistic. it's probably your friend's fault her 20 year old doesn't know how to behave, autistic or not. i'm sorry for you because you may have to leave a friendship behind. if he doesn't warm up to you, it may not be safe for you to be around him. try the present thing before you give up. good luck!|`|pPrSIZeJaa	autism can manifest in many different forms, he mentally may not be able to understand why what he dose is not acceptable. your friend should seriously seek some professional help with her son. he may be better off in a residental care facility that specializes in this kind of situation. (her husband being military probably would have some kind of goverment assistance for the costs.)|`|eBRkh2HLaa	My advice is to do a little research on Autism. Then perhaps you will understand why your friend is so commited to raising her son. I cannot imagine how hard it is to raise an autistic child especially for that many years. I am proud of her. If you are that good of a friend you need to recognize that and help her all you can. Or just get out as you are being only another burden she has to consider.

jswDLpJzaa	If you're separated, she can't  technically be cheating. I would be more worried about why she put a protection order on you... What was her reasoning for that? Sounds like you have some issues there. If it's been a year, & you are still this bothered by it, you need some help.|`|5jMNBO2naa	why would it matter?  you'll soon be divorced|`|qeUoAW6naa	How on earth are we to know? Try and find out for yourself!|`|AA11313204	i dont think it counts as cheating if you are seperated.|`|ffxB7EdZaa	You've obviously done something to cause this order of protection, which means she's terrified of you. You're separated, which typically means you're going to be getting a divorce.     Not every woman who leaves her husband does so because there's someone else.     Don't worry about her, instead, worry about yourself for now. Try to find some legal help and determine in a LEGAL way if she is having an affair. You can present this evidence in court and be done with her.    If she is cheating on you, she doesn't deserve your attention.     Find what she found wrong with you and see if it isn't something you need to improve upon. Next time around you can have a more open and honest relationship where hopefully you won't doubt your partner's fidelity.|`|nfl9xrLFaa	y do u hav to care..u both are seperated..so how does it matter if she is or not???|`|HqkZA842aa	Darling an order of protection arent just given out easily. I should know cuz I put one on my ex mother in law. She was harassing me, trying to cause fights in public, etc. I finally had enough and went up to a judge. He asked what was the reason and he realized it was a good enough reason to put that order of protection. I wont jump into conclusions with how the two of you are. It may be since the two of you are seperated maybe she thought it would be best that the two of you had no contact because maybe she didnt know how you would react during that time of seperation. The best thing to do is not think about it. Try to live your life without her. I wish you the best and hope things go well.|`|EqTrzzixaa	does it really matter??? you are scary, i can't imagine she would come back!|`|i1rDJY2aaa	She left you because you are an immature, selfish, pathetic loser that hits women to overcompensate for your little bitty d!ck.

See u r in class 12 & as far as i knw, its the final year of ur school.Next year u will be in college. So then u can go & meet her after ur college or u can just Bunk it :D    Abt expressin ur love. Well let me tell u, if u think that if u see her everyday then she 'll love u & if u dont meet her everyday then she'll go away ........well then u r wrong. I think she is mature enough to understand that. Meet her atleast once in a week & that should help u both.Keep in touch with her thru phones. Dnt chat with her for 1 hour everyday. Instead, Call her everyday for 15-20mins. Luckily u got net connections so email her & share ur thoughts.    When u'll go to college. make sure u get a job to pay 4ur ph bills. Ur parents loves u & wants the best 4u.They just want u 2 have a good life. when u'll be successful, everyone will be around u. Always remember this !!

Find a way to love yourself or else your life will be a downward spiral of depression, addiction, destruction.

All he has to do anyway is stop going to school for one semester, his GI bill will be put on hold, therefore, no income.  The "$1300" is a living expense stipend to cover his living costs, not to be used as a income.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	The GI Bill is a LOAN from the government, to be used for a college education.|`|el2blDi4aa	yes
J3iBuHAHaa	It sounds like you both have a case of Psycho Jealous Sickness. Jealousy is the grossest feeling in the world, no doubt..but it's one that is very farmiliar to all of us. You would be in this situation with any guy that you were with. (I know this because I have PJS too). The only way I cope with it is to just screw it and say that there are plenty of other guys out there that I can get. I'm sure it's the same for you. Listen honey, if he wants to cheat on you, there is no getting around it. Someone with a cheating mantality will always go with what they want to do. You also have to keep in mind that you can't just lock him up in a cage and make him wear tags with your name on it. He's a human, just like you and I are...and as humans, we will always be attracted to eachother. Flirting happens, and it's not something you can really prevent in this world.     You just need to have a sit down with him, and tell him strait up how you feel about this myspace situation though. If he avoids the subject, then he is obviously hiding something. People only hide things when they know they are wrong or will cause confrontation. Lastly, you should probably give him a little space. Guys don't like needy girls who want to know where they are and who they're with 24/7. You're young, live life...flirt, mingle..true love will come later. Take it from a girl with experience. If you need any more help, e-mail me :)|`|86VgnUmQaa	You can't trust him.. if he said he deleted his myspace and doesn't do it...     in the end, you don't want to be with a bad boyfriend who you can't trust.. it's not a relationship worth saving =\ you deserve better!|`|BINKHZKtaa	Everyone has a Myspace.  He probably felt out of the loop.  Loosten the leash a little bit on him.  ha ha    Are you seriously going to let MySpace ruin the great releationship for love so much?  Just because he is your BF doesn't mean he can never speak a word to another girl ever.|`|X9xNgS4Zaa	its just probably friends or girls that like him---guys like it wen more than one girl likes them even if they are not going to do something with them. dont break-up with a good man because of myspace.|`|b82ybE3gaa	Any relationship won't last without trust, and neither of you obviously don't trust the other. You should think about why that is. Why do you keep talking to other guys and why does he talk to other girls. Also understand that you can't expect him to be a good boyfriend if your not a good girlfriend first.     I don't think, by what you've said here, that you guys are ready for a serious relationship right now, and there is nothing wrong with that unless you are trying to force something to happen with someone when its not time.|`|vhGw1HBuaa	Honestly, it's probably nothing. Guys like to have their own private place that the girl can't go. Trust me, your not doing anything wrong and he's probably not either. Everyone likes some privacy and maybe that's his little getaway. I don't however, agree that he can have a myspace and you can't. Now that's just not fair.|`|uNlbvD5vaa	Move on, why be with someone who obviously doesn't respect you and your wishes. Find a healthy relationship, and there you will find TRUE love. Best of Luck!|`|MkXsrjy6aa	I know alot of people that have that myspace problem...  if you really love him then trust him and if he trusts you then he should let you have a myspace aswell... all that shows is that you 2 dont trust each other... way not have myspaces and have each other's passwords that way there's no secrets... and trust me if he loves you... your the only girl on his mind|`|PIrwKaNWaa	well i have a relationship similiar but worse.... make a fake myspace and try to talk to him....he's probably smarter than that and its not hard to delete your comments so dont be fooled....if you really think he's cheating he probably is...just dont be blind and belive his lies i did for so long when the answers were in my face....time will heal all wounds and your probably beautiful and theres 20 guys for every 5 girls he flirts with lol we have power of the vagina lol just forget him it will hurt ..alot...but it will be over the sooner you deal with it....if he's not he needs to stop hiding **** and if he had nothing to hide why is he avoiding you?  good luck sweetie|`|AA10915534	Its ok ....... Just relax. I think u guys have to trust each other a bit more. Listen, talkin with another girl (4 ur bf) or talkin with anothr guy (4u) it should be ok. There is nothing wrong if he is just talkin with someone else. He should be frank abt it with u. If he is hidin something from u ..well then there could be a prob.        If u dont let him talk with another girls...........well, thats when he starts 2 HIDE.    Just be honest & trust him.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	If you want a relationship with him, you have to get away from the routine of you trying to put restrictions on him and him trying to break free from the leash.    Your relationship sounds too much like a power struggle.    It takes a ton of self confidence to just let someone loose to run free, knowing that if they're REALLY yours, they'll come back all on their  own.    Exactly what would he come back to?      No, your situation isn't easy.  Good luck and best wishes.|`|XVVkrlnTaa	To tell you the truth...your relationship doesn't sound very stable. If you can't trust the man you are with with your whole life, then what is the use of being with him. Do you want to look back after 20 years and still be as insecure as you are now? Why would you want to date a guy who doesn't allow you to have boys as friends? This might sound harsh but this is how I see your situation. I had a boyfriend that was like that but just worse. I couldn't even go out on weekends with my girl friends. This relationship wil suffocate you. And you know what....even if you don't want to hear it or don't want to see it, deep in your heart you know that this is killing you. If both of you can't get past your jealousy, then you are going to have big problems. It doesn't get better, believe me. And if you think one day you are going to get married to him and everything will change.....you are wrong. The best thing that could have happened to me was that we broke up. And just a few months after that, I met my husband....the love of my life. And I now see what I put myself through. It is not worth it.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	sit him down and talk it out. everyone has the oppisite sex friends but therer just friends your that special one that isnt just a friend. hes just guy and there all dumb as rocks we know that! lol let him know how much you care for him and you want this to work and ask him the same thing and let him know you dont want to waste your time on something hes gunna throw down the drain|`|D6pfv64maa	wow i would of thought that i wrote this.  i had the same thing happen and it hurt like he**  when i found out he even put a differ town.  when we first had the my space we had big issues i was one that  next post my pic cause of a ex ex and than when i wanted to this boyfriend didn't like the idea.  I HATE THE MY SPACE  ur boyfriend is a sneaky little jerk just like my ex boyfriend and my ex did the same thing turned the tables on me they know that we don't like so they are sneaky they make on up go figure.  then he wonders why u don't trust him well why should u look what he did.  they made it so the my space is so easy for sneaky people can do lots on there i think that its rude of ur boyfriend and i still hate that my ex did it i still don't trust him about the my space i don't trust any man on there just be careful and don't settle for someone that makes u feel like that if he likes the my space so much tell him to take it and stick it where the moon don't shine and fine urself and man that doesn't  do the my space thing   good luck and wish u all the best|`|OajgvVCDaa	let him know u aint comftble wt wt him and e gals 3ng....and how much u love him....  also u myt wna show him a bit by doin some lil romantic sm3ngs i guess et will help but the best id to talk to him coz he myt understand and stop...|`|JIOJYjFxaa	If that's your ONLY trust issue with him, then I'd say let it go; he knows that you can see whatever anyone puts on there, so chances are he hasn't done, or won't be doing anything wrong with it.  Just enjoy being with him, and be happy :).
Ssv6UqmJaa	Sit down with her, have a conversation. Talk about what's scaring her, and that you don't think she needs to be prepared for anything. You can tell her that you like her as well and that you can both steadily take steps of being together. And i don't think flirting just includes tickling. I think you should just talk to her instead of listening to your friends.|`|bec16h7Taa	How old are you? Its hard to tell you what to do when I don't know what stage of life you're at.     Maybe instead of tickling you should just be sweet to her. I mean if she doesn't think she's ready, reassure her. Be nice. Be chivalrous. Show her that you can be trusted. You know?|`|AA10915534	Dont be her friend....just go & propose her.  & let her decide what she wanna do!!      All the best!|`|yJQpxV75aa	Tell her how you feel, duh.|`|egLhVY35aa	tell her u will wait until she is ready and that u will be there  give her a small present like chocolate or flowers or a teddy bear  flirting: im not to good at that but just be urself|`|oPEzV2EGaa	ok well when she says shes scared shes sayin shes been hurt before and dont want to go through it again let her know tht your not that kinda guy that you wouldnt waste your time for nothing. make her feel speccial. to flirt, ummm just be urself maybe ask her to catch a movie or ask what she likes to do and suprise her|`|0cCV9Litaa	if she is not ready to date then don't pressure her.|`|AA11266289	do what your friend said, flirting...|`|5ph71VMvaa	Be yourself and talk to her.  See what her problem is... no pressure though.  And don't try to be a big shot cause your friends are watching.  In the end it's between you and her.|`|oa8m1Rpyaa	well just ask her out she says no its not the end of the world and there other girls out there :)|`|4Dno6G8xaa	just continue to stay her friend if she "isn't ready."    when she is ready, you guys will still be friends (hopefully closer friends than you are now) and you could make your move then.    be patient. if she isn't "ready" after a while, move on.|`|FF0XMuD8aa	Wait for her. Let her learn to trust you.      Some times a new boyfriend can be scary because you don't want to mess up a friendship or end up getting hurt.    If you really like her, wait for her.    Good things come in time.
AA10040340	It's possible that you didn't write down exactly what was wrong because you don't know what is wrong. My advice is to sit down and write in a journal what you are feeling you problems are and the positives and the negatives in your relationship.    Once this is done and you feel like you have a clear cut idea on what is bothering you about your marriage, sit down with your hubby and discuss what is bothering you and discuss the fact that things need to be repaired in your relationship. In other matters regarding your health, see your primary care physician regarding the depression and get advice concerning your health.     If you have a Sam's Club nearby, there is a book called Love Busters that my church marriage class has used in the past that is an awesome book for both husband and wife. It can also be purchased at any other book store. Also try doing other things that you love doing to get over your depression--I listen to music, read books, magazines, watch funny movies, laugh as much as possible, etc. when things are bothering me.    Communication will be the key to you and your husband getting back on track. Good luck to you both and God bless.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Likely it is the depression that is affecting your marriage. Your husband probably doesn't know what to do and is helpless to make you happy. Here are some suggestions:  1) Make a list of the good things in your life. Then concentrate on each one with a smile.  2) Smile. You will be amazed at how good a smile will lift your attitude. Your coworkers will be more apt to chat with you and so will your husband.  3) Eat healthy. If you are eating junk....sugar and fat. Stop. Eat more meat, vegetables, and fruits.  4) Walk everywhere you can. Join a gym or YMCA and exercise everyday. This will also lift your depression.  5) You should also be evaluated by a doctor. You may need a prescripton for an anti-depressant. It simply means that you don't have enough dopamine or seratonin in your brain. When those are replaced, you will begin your recovery.   6) Go give your husband a hug and kiss tonight after work and tell him what's going on with you. He may think you hate him which is not the case.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	it appears there lack of love and affection in ur marriage..  he still has not accepted u as his vital part..  i dont know exactly if it will work or not   but u should talk with ur hubby about ur feelings..may things resolve..  going on a 4-5 day trip to some serene place may also help|`|iD4ejChZaa	talk to a pastor and his wife, the bible is for all. Jesus loves you.|`|59CaFeS8aa	Whats eating you?    Come out clean. Its not too late. We can save it.    That is , if only you want to save it.    There is nothing called ideal marriage. 99% of them you see around you happily married are only faking it. They are really not. The what?    Yiou ahve to have  alot of adjustment to make things work.    Wake up to shake off the dream.    Understand the stark reality.     I am sure you can think and come to the forum again with the real problem so that we can help you.|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	Healthy communication and conversation between husband and wife is the only solution to come out from the state of depression, if there is any issue or thing irritate or create problem.|`|BfDM12ptaa	probably u both have tight egos...see ritu,everything can become a mess even there is nothing involved..ego is such a thing...know the difference between self respect and ego..men are more attached to it....in india its even more.Just keep cool(try)just say yes!u'll see there would be lesser arguements !and he will know it in no time and appreciiate u...please dont spoil things,u have no big problems at all!|`|AA11313204	have open honest conversations with the hubby. if this doesnt work, seek professional help.|`|afkygHMgaa	One can't help you if you do not say exactly what the problems are. There are no mind readers or miracle workers on here.|`|54f4721ccf359bec18327f26ddcbb78caa	First of all, think about why you're under depression.   You may need to talk to a counselor, psychologist or doctor.|`|HqkZA842aa	Do you feel that the two of you rushed into things? That maybe the two of you were young? This is somewhat hard because your health is at risk here. Maybe its like postpartum depression... maybe its just an inbalance hormone. See this is really hard. Im thinking on what would be the best advice. Talking does help, but maybe you do need to speak with your H and let it out. Maybe you feel that you are doing more in the marriage. If you dont feel that you are ready to talk to him speak with a professional. Wish you the best|`|X3lrPVbKaa	im so sorry u feel this way but try marriage counseling. take a break from everyday life and take a vacation !!!|`|dFlc9DVsaa	Are you looking for something in your marriage.  During the first years of your marriage, you'll be making big adjustments.  You might be expecting the romance will be in full bloom throughout your life.     I'm 24 years married and I also experienced the same thing during our early years in our married relationship.  It was only recently that we discovered what it takes to enhance our relationship.  Talk it out with him and be more creative to keep the romance burning with love.|`|yFKP8f0Aaa	i have the same issue, got married more than a year now  and i feel like i failed by marrying this guy. i just gave birth and husband just came back from deployment and when he got back he is totally a different person. Him being so distant is making me so depress and i found out from my doctor that i have depression and its moderate. i am now taking anti depressant and i'm just really really down. but best advice is to seek help thats what we are doing  now and if it doesnt work then that's when you can decide to end the marriage. it's not too late, why stay with the person who doesnt seem right and make your life misserable for the rest of your life? you dont need that, health is more important than anything else in the world.      goodluck and godbless|`|4lAPihNTaa	come on wats wrong with u, when did u get married, do u have kids?|`|qPSg6lA4aa	Hai friend,  Me too celebrating anniversary in few days but a zero after ur number.  THings were same with me too. I was so depressed tht i thought why do we marry. I had even thought of ending my life, but the thoughts of my parents and siblings used to deny that. I just thought how difficult would they feel after my death?  Ours culture is arranged marriage, so we dont know the person at all before marriage. Is this the same for u?  If so, it takes time to understand the person. Once u are in track of his culture, his habits, his attitude, his nature, then things will go fine with you. Just remember that you should learn to compromise and accept him as ur own. This is just ur initial difficulties......  Go ahead dear, things will be fine with you. Its my promise and assurance.|`|AA11675707	try to come to terms with yur bh and enjoy sex with orgasm for both|`|QV5E70e6aa	Just think what is your inner filling for him.What makes you more nervous about your husband?

God Bless, all the best.|`|0OHdULR0aa	buddy remember these powerful words, "this too shall pass"; i'm sure you'll sort out these issues, as sometimes the relationship hits its low and sometimes is on high; spiritualistically if i have to say, "carry less baggage"; this applies to relationship, too; have less expectations; i guess when expectations dont match, it becomes dissappointment and rest of them follow;   dont allow the situation to overtake you; things will be ok, as long as both of you honestly wish, to.  take a quick break, get out of town and revist those beautiful honeymoon days once again; get romantic; who knows things can dramatically change in a +ive way; may be either one of you have to compromise, no shames as its between both of you, for your great future.  good luck, buddy
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	You should know all you need to know by reading your own words... "boyfriend of 8 years"... Who lets that happen? No matter what you are living in a house of cards until there is a ring on your finger... You should circle your wagons and look out for you and your children... don't hope for a Christmas gift... you should get married so that you have a stronger ability to expect more from him than his resent behavior.    If you are both out of work he may be blowing off some steam because he knows that eventually he will be employed again and another boss will have his testicles in a jar on his desk... You have a young child, you bring with you a child from a previous relationship... you are both out of work... sounds like a mid-life crisis for him.    Keep and eye on him and then rein him in... after 8 years it is time for him to put his money where his mouth is... literally.|`|CPUOzYLPaa	What I have learnt from my life is that never stay dependant on anyone , whether that is your husband , boyfriend , brother , friend or even father . Always keep sufficient money wih you and don't let anyone take advantage of you .|`|GuK9yLGJaa	there are a couple of things that could be going on he could be saving up money for something big like an investment or he could just be selfish and then again he could be leaving you and you havent caught on yet.|`|PRUXtYh5aa	Men take care of their women.  We cater to them.  You are playing the man role in this relationship.  I spend all kinds of money on my wife.  She does not reciprocate in that manner.  What I mainly do is buy her sexy things and help her feel sexy.  Any good man does this.  8 years and he is not doing this?  Tell him exactly how you feel.  If it doesn't have an effect he really doesn't want to be with you.  Sad to say, get rid of him.|`|OTT79NAtaa	You guys should keep your money to yourselves.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Yes he's a cheap bastard and he's getting free babysitting from you. Up to you what you do about it.|`|AA10772811	first you need to talk to him about it and explain to him exactly what you said here. If it continues then you need to get your money situation together and keep a tight hold on it. As far as the children are concerned than you both need to come up with a monthly contribution that he needs to pay if hes going to be acting like that.
KPXwwwMMaa	Do nothing.     A lot of people do not check their facebook accounts regularly. Your question is not an insensitive question to ask. You haven't seen him in a long time, and want to know the status of his life. That's a pretty normal question to ask, and shows you are concerned about him.    Give him a week or two. If he still doesn't talk to you, you might email him and say, "Hey, it sounds like you're really busy. I hope everything's going okay for you!" Just to let him know that you are still there.     But honestly, after 10 years, are you trying to connect and make friends with him again? or are you just saying 'hello'?|`|AA11890009	nothing!just wait for the reply.if this person replies saying that the mom isn't anymore,just apologize saying you didn't know and that you genuinely did not do it intentionally.....
QTjnxatraa	I really feel for you, I do.  I am size 16 (in all the wrong places) and been with my boyfriend 15 months but been friends for 10 years...when I was a size 12...owch!!! so you can imagine I was almost climbing the walls when it came to getting naked around him.    Your boyfriend has been with you 2 years which speaks volumes to me but it is a shame that he hasn't made an effort to make you feel at ease about your body.  He is with you for a reason and he loves you.      It took me a while to realise that when a guy is in love with you, he loves everything about you and those things that bother you the most about your body, he thinks are sexy.     A guy looks at you much differently than you do so I reckon you should take some risks, you just might blow him away with your new confidence, a guy loves that stuff.  Good luck.|`|PAY58zPNaa	does ur boyfriend really want to see you naked?  if you feel uncomfortable then you should start slowly.  you should love yourself before you love another.  and you could start of by just wearing some nice, sexy lingerie like a nice bra and a thong.  and then once you feel comfortable in that, then you can be bra less, then soon pantie less.|`|b82ybE3gaa	I'm sorry you haven't gotten an honest answer from anyone yet, but I would say turn off the lights, and wear a t-shirt, if you want to be completely naked then close your eyes, he loves you, all of you and he thinks your sexy.    I have the same problem and it doesn't help that my boyfriend weighs all of 128 pounds he is very skinny, but he loves me, I usually leave my shirt on and shut off the lights and try to focus on other things like the feelings, and making him excited as well.|`|fAKKv0ytaa	if he's your boyfriend, he WANTS to see you naked, all the time. When your actually naked he is most likely getting a ***** and getting horny, not criticizing what you look like.|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	I would say it is not your boyfriend, but your own personal perception of your body.      You have to realize your own beauty. This is self-esteem, and self confidence.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	do it slowly  - try being around him in jus ur undies -  then progress to jus topless  - and then full blown nude thats all I can think of|`|pm6h7YNPaa	I think that your are uncomfortable with yourself, not that your boyfriend is. If he didnt want to see you naked he would have ended it, boys are very easy to read . I would suggest maybe dim the lights or just change your lifestyle and try to lose some weight. I mean even a size or two would make a big difference in your confidence.|`|NRxa4KSraa	yea, i know what ur going through.... so, i am about the same Weight as u. at first i could not even look at myself in the mirror . so ,i told my self i have to be happy with my own body before i can get naked 4 my man. i went out and bought panties that fit my body wish look good.  then a bra that gave me bust and a few pieces  to sleep in. so,i live alone and every night when i came home from work, i put them on and walked around until i felt comfortable  in my own skin. this has worked 4 me. i love my body and look at myself in the mirror all the time.......|`|nOsVBF2Iaa	Truthfully, most girls are thinkin' "I hope he isn't looking at that too close"...most guys are thinkin' "Yay! she's naked!".  We all worry about our bodies. It's society's cruel joke on all of us,  both guys and girls. I'm a size 0 to 2 junior with a "D" rack, and I still feel uncomfortable naked. He likes you as you are, so just try to enjoy the moment!  :)|`|yEosR5Naaa	SLOWLY STEP AWAY FROM THE TWIKIES|`|HGVUSCqVaa	just keep going for that... you'd probably get used to the idea.|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	well maybe you dont trust him or hes not treating u right and wen ur naked u feel uncomfortable ...hard question by the way|`|cQ30Qla9aa	he actually criticizes very skinny girls to make you feel better|`|nFVYFWwRaa	It took my wife ten years to take her top off during sex she was so uncomfortable being nude around anyone. It takes a lot of time and trust.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Full Figures can be very attractive.  Learn to enjoy being naked alone before learning to share being naked and intimate.  It is a matter of social development. Relax and explore.|`|iKUnaAlfaa	work out, loose weight, get a tan, fix your hair.....who cares if your boyfriend thinks your fine, do what you wanna do and feel good bout yourself. look in the mirror and be like "whoa!"...u beyonce or whoever was born lookin "fine"? don't get crazy bout it, but jus realize it never killed anyone to work out for an hour a day..........and don't worry about what others think of you|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	Take the compliments you receive from your boyfriend and take them to heart. If he's telling you he loves this and that, allow that to give you confidence, because there really isn't anything to worry about being  naked in front of your boyfriend.     Buy a really pretty dress, lingerie or a nice fitting shirt to show off your curves or legs - whatever! Your boyfriend will love it too.   I hope once you dress in something really nice, you'll gain more and more confidence because you'll then see the beauty your boyfriend does.      I'm not happy with my body either, but I'm comfortable to be naked around my boyfriend - and he loves my body which gives me confidence to flaunt it. I love my curves!|`|4vLt3SqFaa	Begin by becoming comfortable with who and what you are.  I don't care if you lose weight now, later or never - what matters is that you get comfortable with yourself.      So when you are by yourself try and go naked as often as you can.  Learn to hang out and watch tv or search the net nude.  Sleep naked.  Take some time and look at yourself intimately - something a lot of women have never done.  When you do you will find you are really quite amazing.  Women's bodies have much to explore and discover and when you find out just how special you are you will be more comfortable with others seeing you naked.|`|Bv0I2aRAaa	You have to do what is comfortable for yourself...I am sure your boyfriend would prefer to see you naked and is being very supportive of you...he wants to increase your confidence in yourself...this will in turn help you get in better shape mentally and physically...|`|rMq9D06Faa	At least you realize it is YOUR issue, not your boyfriend's.    If you are not happy with your body you have two choices:    (1)  Accept yourself for who you are.  We all have flaws and that is what makes us unique.    (2)  Change it.  If you are THAT uncomfortable in your skin, then it sounds like you are taking steps to change it.    Either way, don't let it ruin a relationship with a guy who obviously likes you for who you are!|`|cj8iM1Olaa	14??    Holy Cow, i fit in a size 8(barely). and i'm 6'5 235 Yeah, i tried on woman's pants once, b/c i was shallow and wanted to know how big she really was.
pKzH1cFHaa	He is a pervert and you need to tell him to stop. Make a scene about it. Yell "Stop touching my bra!" He will stop, he will be embarrassed, and he will get into trouble. Tell an adult too. He needs to learn that what he is doing is wrong and to never do it again. If you don't speak up, he will keep doing it, not just to you, but to others as well.|`|PCBQbQmraa	he squeezed you to squeeze your boobs together hes being a perv you shouldn't let guys do this to you. Its very disrespectful hes basically trying to get hard off your body by force!|`|FF0XMuD8aa	Tell him that it really makes you feel uncomfortable, [if it does]    Boys are just like that. If he's your age he's thinkin with the wrong head hunny. He's testing his boundaries. This is your time to tell him what's right or wrong. If you don't stick up to guys like that, they'll walk all over you.|`|54f4721ccf359bec18327f26ddcbb78caa	I call this harassment, or maybe even sexual harassment.     Report to the principal!|`|oPEzV2EGaa	honey boys ur age are very in mature, yes he was trying to feel your chest just to get the feeling. just push him off you or say something to the teacher that your un comfertable cuz if  you dont speak up now it will only get worse|`|0suHzbA7aa	try to get away from the boy. he doesn't seem to harm u. this might be his way of expressing love to u . just keep on following the boy and his claims in front of u. o.k.|`|DBoxelmlaa	he is wrong person so keep away this guy
odacqJuEaa	once you love someone they will always be in your heart, its hard to let them go, he might still love her.  its hard to say tho, some people can live and forget about people some cant    he loves you tho, you stopped his depression as far as i know. i dont believe he will leave you, its ok to feel like this because once someone loves someone its hard to let them go, if he is the guy that is like this 99% he wouldnt go back to her.    and he sounds like a great man, dont try to loose a real "man"|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well everyone you date that meant something to you will always have a special place. I still loved my ex and I havent talked to him in years. If I saw him again, it would definitely be a friend type of connection. But I would never date him again. Its just the time and memories you have with that person that lasts.     I wouldnt worry about it. Hes moved on with you. Not her.|`|l5wziiicaa	I don't think that he still loves her.  He is the one that moved on first, so he lost interest and if anything, maybe she would be the one to still care since he just moved on while she was out of town.  I think when he said "I really don't know if I ever will."  I think that meant, I don't care for her and really don't think I ever will get back with her...if that makes any sense?  Just relax, if he says he is planning on proposing sometime, than he must really love and care for you but you.|`|7eI0kW5Uaa	if he's happy with you, then it just all means, he loves you.  once you loved somebody so much, you won't be able to forget them, they'll always be in your heart.|`|g9qumvDLaa	You will always have a "soft spot" for people that you have loved. It doesn't mean for instance that he still loves her, it means that they shared part of their lives together, and that's a hard thing to forget. It doesn't mean that he doesn't love you, but you have to understand that you are new, and chances are that you haven't had an opportunity to have whatever they had yet (the good parts I mean). Just be patient and understanding. Eventually he will be able to leave the past in the past and move on to a new and happy future with you. Just hang in there!

When a girls says she likes it..it's because she is insecure and needs the attention.|`|KKPsTOXgaa	if you're not going anywhere (relationship-wise) then it gets really annoying.   a short conversation every now and then is okay,  but everyday just makes a girl think your stalking her or something.  unless your bf/gf dont txt a girl everyday.|`|RV3oeESvaa	i rather have him call  because texting u never know what they can be doing?

While it sounds like you have been doing a fine job the courts are often helpless to do much but place such children in the foster care system.  At the very least I suspect the State will take custody and you "might" retain care of the child pending social services evaluation of your home situation.      Termination of parental rights is usually very long and complicated.  I wish you all the best but realistically you are facing a  very long struggle with a uncertain outcome.    The judge will probably admire your willingness to help and often will tell you as much, but as I said there may be procedural guidelines that he or she cannot alter.  Your lawyer should have given you a good outline of how such case work in your area.|`|AA11313204	court is in 4 days and you dont have a lawyer? GET ONE!!!|`|iD4ejChZaa	yes i would certainly think the court would give him to you, it's good you love that abandonded child.|`|smFfcmYuaa	If you actually got made his legal guardian that should help since it's not like you just found the kid in the dumpster. But in general you stand a good chance of losing him short-term as part of stupid due process but eventually getting custody of him. As a matter of misguided principle courts always prefer to place a child with their family. Failing that if someone has been taking care of the child for long enough and is in good standing financially and legally then there is almost no reason for them not to award custody.     Obviously your lawyer has a case to present as well and that will look better than you merely begging the judge to let you keep the kid.    Of course it is Mississippi so if your judge and the kid and your husband aren't the same color as you (either way) then racism might beat justice in the face once again. If it seems like that is the case at least you'd have grounds for an appeal or a lawsuit though.    So I guess I'll say you overall have a 3/4 chance of getting the kid eventually and a 50% chance of winning your case right now. If you could have gotten the kid's father legally on board (maybe you'll be lucky and the kid isn't actually his) that would have been better but maybe you still can.|`|GRuIq6Igaa	Your lawyer has a better idea than anyone else.  Kudos to you for wanting to keep the baby and take care of him/her.
TuGiuChfaa	He may be, but then again may not. Point is he's not appreciating what he has with you and saying work is his main priority doesn't make the relationship better why would you want to be with someone who just doesn't make an effort to be with you? Maybe its time for you to move on that way you could find someone who is READY to appreciate you. Well good luck! =)|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Try actually talking to him about it.|`|f25peTSXaa	disapear for a week or two   that should solve the problem =)    sometimes guys act distant because deep down they want to be reassured you care    dont reward bad behavior     just with no attitude do your own thing and forget about him for a bit  seehow he responds|`|IQq0wNqQaa	It doesn't mean he is cheating, but work should never be a priority over a person. If he's not appreciating you, that just means he's a d*ck. If he is being distant, then that probably means that he is getting what he needs elsewhere (not necessarily cheating, but maybe he has been talking to someone or what have you). You need to pull him aside and have a heart to heart with him. If you don't get at least some answers and explanations that make sense, then you should make him realize what he stands to lose.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Your needs are not his top priority and who knows where they are on his list of self-indulgent pleasures.

Spare yourself and him the drama. Anyone in a good relationship, wouldn't ask these questions? If he says its work and you think its because of other issues like cheating, maybe you are too insecure to be in this relationship, either way it doesn't matter, your feelings of insecurity whether he is honorable or not, has doomed the relationship.|`|h9XfQDxNaa	dumb him if he doen't appreciate u|`|rL0k9trPaa	i'm not sure don't be so quick to assume things though

But if your going to be a plastic surgeon you will need to get used to woman talking about there bodies. They may or may not be flirting with you. But the truth is they do it because they are uncomfortable with who that are, and your going to fix it. My advice get find a good woman, and get happily married fast. Because you know some gold digger will try to snatch you!|`|2soyTz7eaa	She is a whore basically. If you love you girlfriend run from that whore. Do not talk to her ingore her.

But I'm more inclined to think she's tacky and just wants a free (or significantly discounted) enhancement. If it's unlikely she'll be able to afford one soon on her own or if she's just cheap, this is probably your answer.    Either way, if you like your girlfriend, try avoiding this subject around the sister and be on guard. If she is flirting it could cause serious problems and you don't want your girlfriend to doubt her trust in you. Can't hurt to be careful.|`|L69jZMXQaa	fer sho
GRuIq6Igaa	DON'T move in with him!!!! Do NOT do this!! I did this. I ended up being raped and alone and scared to death!  I am not saying this will happen to you.  I am saying to allow yourself to transistion from teenager to adult.  TRUST ME!  PLEASE learn from my mistake?    I was so naive and stupid.  I had a crash course lesson in reality.  I hated the lessons and I really hated being raped.  It took me years to admit I was raped.  Then years to work through the hurt.  I am a much stronger woman now for everything I went through.  BUT if I can help someone else to avoid this then I will.    You will regret moving in with him.  You need to be a fun loving young adult.  Get out and play!  He already had his chances.  If he LOVES you he will let you go off to college and do your thing.  If he loves you, when you have your degree and you get started in your career, then he will be more stable himself and both ofyou will have a happier relationship.  TRUST ME!  Please trust me.  Finish High school. Graduate and enjoy what you have.  Go to college.  Then when all is said and done, if he is still available and you are ready for it, then get married and have as many babies as you want.  Give yourself a chance to live first.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	your only 17 do NOT move in with him, your young and you need to have time to enjoy yourself as a person before you make your entire life about a relationship that serious|`|K1TUT0mZaa	Whe I was 17 I was in a similar situation, and I know now that I made the right choice.  I was dating a guy who was about 6 years older than me and he mentioned moving in and marriage.  After I graduated, I moved half way across the country to go to school, then moved 3 states away for my job.  My career and my choices in life are something that will be with me forever whether my man is or not.  Turns out I was way better off without him anyways, but I figured if it was meant to be then he would be there once I had established my life.    I will add that I met someone once my life was established and I have been married for almost 2 and 1/2 years now.  I got married when I was 20 and now I know that that was still too young...too late now.  There is still so much I want out of life, but that stopped me dead in my tracks.    When you do date someone, be sure to have safe sex and protect yourself.  Put yourself first.  Don't rush into marriage or having kids, just enjoy your life and do what makes you happy.  Once you have kids it is a lot harder to accomplish things (I have a friend who is a single mom and she is really struggling).      Guys will always be around, no matter what age you get to they are always there so don't waste your time worrying about them now.  As humans we aren't just attracted to one person out of the whole world.  At different points in your life you will find different people who meet your needs; don't rush into anything.  Get where you want to be then worry about guys.    If this guy really loves you then he will wait!|`|4lAPihNTaa	intresting but not too good for you to live together with a older guy, he may be as sweet as candy, but be careful he mite dich u after he is satsfied. so think about the future and decide, as a bor i say no. try to deviate your mind on some thing else , you have more things to enjoy your life yet, this happiness is very meen for ur future and u may repent if u do so.|`|AA11313204	dont move in yet. feel free to get engaged. practice safe sex. wait till you can support yourself before you get married. otherwise you will feel too dependant on him and it will be very difficult to leave him later if you need to. if he loves you he will be understanding and he will wait.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Arlene, you are way, way, way, too young to move in with anyone. 27 is too old for you and the only thing that will happen to you is that he will get you pregnant, you will never finish school, and he will leave you in  a year or two. I know you feel that you are so close to being an adult... but don't make a mistake at 18 that will impact the options for your life at 28, 38, 48 and 78.     There are a lot of fish in the sea and "liking" a guy is not enough. Live your life, experience college, learn, grow, figure out who you are, build the foundation of skills so that you can ensure that you can have a career that will provide for you throughout your life... then when you really understand who you are and what you want, then you can offer to share your life with a person that you love... and be on equal footing.    This current situation you are in is not good... there is only one storybook outcome and two dozen worse options that are more likely. Take care of yourself. Chances are this 27 year old is with you because his age makes him feel secure and have control over you. He should be with someone his own age and you should be experiencing all of the new and exciting things that being young and in school will bring to you... you have your whole life to live, please don't settle now.|`|GuK9yLGJaa	ok seriously your not even 18 and he is damn near 30 for the love of god that is weak do not be tied down be for you have even experienced life try dating guys your age for a little while and see how you feel hell you cant even go to the bar yet|`|5d32Q1Craa	Stay in college, establish your life..

4KtPFzz5aa	Rachelle, I feel your pain.  I had almost the exact same situation, child, no dad around and all, except my father was also physically abusive to me only.  If at all possible, you need to move away from your hometown.  If that is not possible, try to stay away from him as best you can.  Do not, however, forbid him from seeing your son.  If your son can be treated well by your parents, then allow him that.  Children need all the love they can get.  If, however, your child comes home unhappy, put a stop to it.  As they grow, they will see for themselves how your parents treat you, and they won't like it.  I know this from experience.  So, there is no need to prevent them from seeing your folks, or to diss the folks in front of them.    Find a church home.  Our priest was my 2 sons' saving grace, even through their teens.  Til now, they respect him totally, although he has since passed away.  He gave them guidance, kindness, and an occasional scolding when they needed it.  He was there for me, too, when my own family wasn't.  They stayed involved in church activities from the time they were born til high school.    Trust in God.  Even when it doesn't seem like He's there, maybe even especially then, He is.  I agree, as much as I know from experience how much it hurts, but you have no real earthly father.  Cling instead to our Heavenly Father.  Good luck & God bless!|`|nYnlQPu1aa	Have you ever talked about your feelings with your dad?  Do you have other male family member that you are close with and he can help you out emotionally and also help your son?  I think that you should talk to your counselor.  You are strong that you have been dealing with this problem for long time; And also think that every thing could have been worse and you have your son next to you and it is a blessing that you have. You have your other family members that I think they can help you out somehow. Try to find some one! such a problems are happening to all of us in different ways.

p5Zxf5nraa	Depression is a serious mental health problem... and I mean *serious*.  If you haven't ever had a mental health problem, it's going to be hard for you to understand how bad he can feel at times.  I'm speaking from experience here - depression ruined my last relationship because my partner, despite our love for each other, couldn't understand my condition.  It wasn't from lack of trying on her part, and no, I wasn't unfaithful - she couldn't handle not knowing how to support me, and I couldn't handle how my not being able to be there for her hurt her.  So, depression is definitely the starting point for the problem, and trust me - if he has depression, he is not living anyone's dream, he is living a nightmare.    For some people, depression kills the sex drive (which can also be a side effect of anti-depressant medications); for others, sex offers a brief time away from pain.  So, sleeping around is maybe his way of trying to manage the pain he feels, figuring that the pleasure he gets from the sex is a brief respite from the mental anguish that is most of his life.  Another possibility is he feels unworthy of being truly loved, and so figures sex is all there is.  Maybe he is looking for understanding and is finding sex instead.  Who knows... the way he is handling the situation is not ok - you probably need to confront him about it - but try not to take it personally.  Depression can do a lot of damage to thinking patterns and reasoning.  There may be a reason in his mind that makes sense to him as to why what he is doing is ok - even if it the reason doesn't make sense to anyone else.      If you want to save the relationship and help him, then direct him towards medical help and try to support it as he gets that help.  If you need to break it off, then try not to do damage when you do - his actions have hurt you but try to remember that he is hurting too.    Oh, and if he doesn't have depression and is just lying, then he is a complete and total (insert string of expletives here) and you would be justified in (long list of suggestions will not be included so as to stay in line with Yahoo! Answers Terms of Service).|`|93821bdb5da3d5a2f104f4b3594f9053aa	Its not all about sex. Its about going to dinner and having a great time!

It's entirely possible he's a slut to cover for his depression -- a self-esteem boost, an escape, whatever. It's also entirely possible he's just a slut by nature and the depression has nothing to do with it. He wouldn't get depressed from sleeping around unless he felt some kind of guilt about it; more likely than not you're better off dealing with the two issues separately. Can you date a guy who isn't monogamous by nature? Can you date a guy who has depression?     Just one thing though -- if he wants all the freedom he can get but he loses it when you suggest getting a bit on the side yourself, fuhgeddaboutit.|`|L69jZMXQaa	He's just a playa. so you should play around too|`|tZlfF4ooaa	HA! What a SAD life HE leads! LOL! I feel so sorry for him...NOT.|`|GrhiWC4uaa	I think the cause is from a low self esteem and from only getting temporary satisfaction for a more serious issue..He might suffer from depression due to some attachments with these other woman as well..Usually when you have sex with a lot of people? You give a small amount or part of yourself away to each person.These women probably give him nothing but temporary satisfaction when he needs to find someone who will be with him and be real and long lasting,not temporary and UN-fulfilling.He probably needs to find himself again and gather up those missing pieces he has scattered about...You give yourself away to too many people or completely away?That just spells trouble if you don't give yourself enough time to heal or if you just jump from one relationship to the next. Heh if it were me, I would be depressed as well..Hard to recover from losing myself in the madness.|`|EZKe92TTaa	first of all, go get tested for stds including hiv.   it doesn't sound like you're in a meaningful relationship, correct me if i'm wrong. i don't mean to insult if you care for this guy. but if he's sleeping around, he needs to sort himself out, nothing to do with you. you don't need to date a cheat. probably best to move on.   you ask why he is depressed, he obviously has issues and problems, but drowning in the arms of another woman is not an answer to problems. it's just instant gratification, but he is still left with his problems. if you care for him tell him to go to a therapist, maybe with you. but i still suggest you leave him for someone more trustworthy and in a healthier state of mind.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Chances are its got nothing to do with him sleeping with lots of women. Most likely they are not related.    There are guys who get no women and they are depressed, just as there are guys who get lots of women and can be depressed. Just as there are poor people and rich people who have depression. Its just some mental imbalance they have have in their life for whatever reason.     I know there are a lot of people who say he is depressed because he sleeps with lots of women blah blah, most likely that's not the case.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	yayaya..did he say : sorry dear i sleep around, im just very depressed ..? he is just another assh*&e who like to sleep around and simply giving the dumbest excuse i ever heard from a man to you as a woman...

Figure out what you want.|`|uReFjOONaa	Well I think you should talk to him about this|`|8314e0c5ee765b606d480c267bf5f6cbaa	first u have to get ur wires straight, if u r gay, talk to him about this, if u r not give him another chance|`|r07mkYWHaa	First, you need to figure out you before you can be with any one. Gay or not. If you don't know who you are, then you can't possibly know what you want from some one else. On top of that you won't be able to make any one else happy because you aren't going to be happy. Take a breather from every one and try to find out what you know about you and what you want for your self. Then go from there. The pieces will all fall together. And tell him that you thing your gay. Explain to him and if he really loves you, he will help you and support you.( After some possible anger) Give him time and support to work through his emotions about it too.
PRUXtYh5aa	Look.  Even after 10 years of marriage a man still wants, needs, sex on a regular basis.  It is part of our being.  That is just how it is.  Of course a man wants to get into your pants.  That is natural, but that is definitely not all he wants.  Men want to be cared for as well.  We want to be with a woman who wants us as much as we want them.  We want to treat our lovers like princesses and take care of them as much as we can.  Perhaps you have dated some losers who aren't really men.  The rest of us.  The real men.  We know what love is all about.  We know how to treat a woman.     I hope you find someone soon who will teach you what it is like to be with a truly decent person as most men really are.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	You have a distorted image of guys because you believe that all guys are like this.    I am quickly becoming cold-hearted, because I was once warm-hearted and my kindness was taken for granted. I can, regrettably, fall in love, and much too easily. I'm predominantly after companionship and a meaningful relationship before sex. I seek to matter to someone in this life.    I suggest you realize that just as many women take advantage of their men if not more. I suggest you realize that the world isn't so black and white, and that you can't blame an entire gender for the misdeeds of a handful.|`|y999LLxdaa	All guy are like that until they meet some one they wont to be different with, but don't confuse this with "changing  a guy" you cant change a person.|`|jumISG9laa	not all guys are like this ur just looking at all the wrong guys|`|qy07K2k5aa	You should go out and meet more people.

I would continue to wonder about any man that takes you out.  What his intentions are, and so on...    You can't let the idea of every man just wanting to get his dick wet keep you from dating, assumably thats what they all want at  first, but if they get to know you. (After not having had it) Things turn around.    Find someone to befriend, and then build off of that.      If you aren't concious of what men are capable of and know that they just want that one thing, you will end up hurt.    I grew up thinking that the attn I got from guys was great, and that they just wanted to be cool with me.  I understand now, and wish I could have said something to me back then.      Keep your head on straight, it seems like you are a smart girl|`|YlQcy0Xzaa	I agree that their are some elements of truth in your statement, However, i think it would be incorrect if you statiscally extrapolate it to all the guys in particular....

It just takes a bit more because overall we are less desperate to be in love and can deal with being alone when we have to. Yes. We want to bone you. It's our nature. But just because we think of sex 24/7 doesn't mean all of us will actually do it. If we find the right one, were satisfied with that.|`|nFVYFWwRaa	Most guys are just like that until they hit about 25, they just don't see it themselves.  You can find the guy you want just look for the geek that no-one like that's because he cares and not follow the male code close enough, however girls will find a good and true lover in him.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	I have a similar opinion of certain females.|`|ec4552cc0681df2ba00b4ddc564a7691aa	but you know that a guy that is the opposite will never fulfill your emotional needs. guys fall in love all the time. but you have to realize that WE initiate the contact with the woman. Its not the other way around. So get a grip and let us do our thing. This behavior looks like we are predators, but what is wrong coming up to you to say hello? That means we are interested and maybe one of us are either the DOGS or the Gentleman.|`|r07mkYWHaa	This is true for guys of all ages. And there is nothing you can do about it. A man has sex on his mind all the time. Use your instinct here. It's the only thing that is going to help you. If you feel like he's trying to sweet talk you for sex then he more then likely is. Don't be rude about it. Just kindly tell him you want to be friends only. He will get the point that you aren't going to have sex with him and if he continues to be your friend, then it takes it's own course.|`|aZwJyBtAaa	Ok yes this can be true but it's not true for all guys! The ones you are attracting are this type! You have to ask yourself what do i want? If you want just to have a fling with a guy and be pseudo friend then guess what that's exactly what your going to attract! You have to higher your standards and pick the losers out of the equation and throw them back in the pond. You can tell whose who just by first conversation! Does he have good eye contact, does he ask about you, when does he call (at night bad/ day time means i like you i want to spend time KNOWING you)! The key thing is to wait, stop going after the jerks and just wait! Take time and do your own thing and then prince charming will come along. Don't be desperate.|`|ghUyQEDiaa	Well if you've been mistreated by men in your life, then I don't blame you. Some of them are cold hearted, some are the exact opposite. But one day, you'll find someone that'll change your view on men.|`|w3MziozHaa	In all fairness, a lot of guys only have sex and playing games on their minds, but there are also some who don't. Just be patient and be aware of dogs who are like that.

sr7jX2wYaa	I know  it is  too late now, but if  she says something  about you being clingy again, Just  laugh & say well I guess that makes 2 of us, cause your always here too.   As  far as what to talk about  ask people there interests, Or what kinds of things  they like doing,  or what is there favorite site on the computer,  do they like My Space or  Face book better, There are many things to talk about , & a good  way to find someone who has the same interests  as you, which will give you someone to talk to & hang out with  Invite  the nice friend & the girl who called you clingy to do something with you, instead of being a follower, come up  with something fun to do & Your the leader  on that adventure, since it is your  idea*|`|rQmBuXnaaa	an hero|`|1hlIzEnTaa	Girls in high school can be ridiculous like that! You might have to find other ones to hang out with, or even guys, most times guys are a lot easier to become and stay friends with because they're not nearly as dramatic,they're pretty easy to start up conversation with too! Keep hanging out with those girls but try to make small talk with other people in your classes, you can never have too many friends, and most of them are looking for new ones too.. that's what high school's all about!|`|uReFjOONaa	.|`|L69jZMXQaa	no ur fine|`|5WB2yZUFaa	i feel for ya. i wish i had some good advice, but i don't. i was in your same situation, and i remember that same fear in high school. unfortunately, i never really did make any close friends back then, but none of that even matters now. i'm 22, i'm married, and a have a beautiful baby boy.  the girl who said that to you is a bit**. and you're not clingy. high school is the hardest time of your life, socially, so just hang in there. it gets better.|`|ETi4v60Saa	Just tell your friends that you have tuberculosis|`|sYwkpH7Jaa	just chill and ignore others|`|lJ84gldxaa	Ignore that *****. She's probably just jealous, or threatened. Just try to be more broad, and be friendly with everyon ein the group, not just one, and dont be too shy. Be open.     People like confident people. If you keep quiet, no one will appreciate your company and they'll assume youre not even there, just an audience.    But yeah, if your friend had a problem she would have told you, but at the same time probably didnt want to escelete in what the ***** said, or probably didnt want to get involved. Just ignore the bitchy one and keep doing what youre doing.    It kills them when you dont take offense. It hurts them even more if you go about your way, and ignore their mean remarks!    I started school again today (Australia) new campus, and met a few new people. Dont think I was a tag along because I just engaged in a conversation with everyone!... not just a few.|`|cLrkXn6gaa	The girl who is calling you clingy is probably just jealous, and wants you to find new friends. Although if you don't want to be the third wheel, my advice is to find a new group of friends. Somebody who is better fitting to being your friend.
YSbCVt3Uaa	Not at all. When I was in high school and junior high we always used to hug friends good bye. Even if you met someone that you clicked with at a party. Its a nice sign of acceptance. Don't make it more than it is.     When I think of clingy; I think of a stalker.|`|HI5aBVYgaa	lol first of all i love her name like michael jackson's song hahahah. ANd no come on it was just a hug! if anything she probably liked you. Good Luck|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Nah i'd love it if someone offered me a hug just after meeting them. Especially a guy lol|`|hPvDGMjjaa	firstly are you a boy or a girl?  if your a boy then the girl probably feels great  and if your a girl then she probably feels welcome and friendly towards you|`|7dPwXcItaa	aww, no, of course not, that's sweet, it shows her that you value her friendship. It's not like you asked her to make out with you! people please awnser mine: http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|t26ctJdraa	i had this friend that hugged me everytime he saw me. it bothered me some. back off a little|`|YErSkMNEaa	I don't think you were being to clingy. If she happily agreed I don't think it was a bad thing at all. Alot of times girls think it's sweet when you hug them. I know I do :)|`|k9vEbo0xaa	Nah, I don't think so. I think that's really cute. =)  No worries.
AA12135516	I have heard of it happening but very rarely so i wouldn't risk it if i were you. You have knocked him back & i bet he's not used to a girl doing that so therefore you are now his biggest challenge, so if i were you i'd avoid going to his room where he can be alone with you cos people like that can be very manipulative & you will just end up another trophy in his collection As for what your friend said about you being the prettiest he's ever been with...well that would probably make you his prized trophy! Think about it & good luck.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Won't happen - he's looking for something, and you didn't give it to him, so now he's probably thinking your a challenge, and once he gets you he probably will not want you anymore.    So, yeah, your friend is right that you should just forget about him.    Besides that, if you go into a relationship expecting to change him, and it doesn't happen, it just makes things bad for everyone involved - you'll both be hurt somehow.|`|Y8YihNrwaa	i say impossible because he is such a player as you have describe him do be careful and avoid going to his place or you might end up another trophy in his collection
wCZ3T5QLaa	Not impossible but damn near impossible. I was heavy into the party scene and couldnt seem to find any girl interesting enough to get serious with. Then finally I found a girl I was interested in and dropped the party scene. If hes a die hard party fan then yes it will be tough. Try doing something public with him than hanging out alone at his apartment. Go on a lunch date and try to get to know him a little better. If you get straight to something physical then there will be no hope for anything real. Tell him where you stand with the physical relationship and if hes a keeper he will understand. My own advice dont trust a party type because chances will almost always be you will be let down.|`|41NyT8oPaa	Maybe he will be able to stay in a relationship for 1 month , then he will go back to his old self again, girl he wants to be in your pants only and don't waste your time with a party boy ,he only wants to have fun.|`|uReFjOONaa	ummm its hard|`|C2DBglhnaa	I can imagine your situation, liking him but not being sure how to handle it.  Ultimately the decision is up to you, whether or not you want to be with him.  If he's wanting to sleep with you, you should tell him you only would want to if he was willing to make a commitment.   Personally, I think that you should try and stay away from him, because he'll always be trying to pressure you into something you're uncomfortable with.  Don't try and make him jealous, both of them may end up being hurt if you let it slip you're using one to make the other jealous.  I hope everything works out.|`|GoEaSOSraa	You must be a teenager or really naive because if you were older you would already know the answer to this question. Hunny, he wants you for one thing and one thing only...SEX. Being the prettiest girl doesn't mean anything and as far as trying to get him jealous...real men don't like women that play mind games like that. You need to get over this guy.|`|eLxcDtItaa	Virtually impossible. You're just setting yourself up to get knocked down.|`|r07mkYWHaa	lmao!!! First off, don't try to make him jealous. That's ridiculous and only going to make him think that you like games and he's not going to value you or your thought of having a relationship with him. He's going to think your a tramp. Along with every one else that may be around to see it. Secondly, ask him to take you out and spend time with him out side of the party scene. Your view might change. If he won't take you out or will only hang out with you during a "party" then you don't want to waste your time with this guy.|`|IPS3hWweaa	As a rule, guys don't like to settle down until they are in their late 20s. You could try having a serious talk with him, but I doubt he'll go along, he'll just look for someone easier.|`|t26ctJdraa	u could be the prettiest girl on earth and it wouldnt matter. if he can hit it it's over girl! and u flirting w another guy isnt gonna make him like u more. guys like him dnt care about crap. just themselves ok. u will just be a conquest and thats all.|`|tqMi1Iefaa	If your whole relationship so far consists of a couple of gropes when you have turned up at his place, don't do it!  If he hasn't even got the character to bother to ask you out before he has a feel, don't go back to that place again. There are plenty of others around who will help him get laid, don't be used, you wont like him or even more importantly, yourself afterwards.  Keep away.
AEZ75dJ7aa	I agree that you need to start feeling better about yourself.  Maybe your looking in the wrong places.  If you find some different places to meet people you may find out the girls think your hot and sexy instead of ugly and scary.  If you work as a farmer go to more agricultural functions.  Auctions, rodeos, barn dances (lol- do they still have those?)  the girls you meet there are more likely to enjoy your life style and understand you better.  Most girls really want a gentle kind man that will treat them like goddesses-  the smart ones will find you charming.   Have faith kiddo-  she's out there wondering where you are and when your gonna show up?  Just get your butt out there and find her!!!!!!!!|`|tNSGSxezaa	if there r girls for horses and dogs there r girls for guys like us|`|b82ybE3gaa	um..maybe you should start by caring for yourself more, you don't need a desperate girl, you need someone that will love you. And if you care enough and get out there enough you will find a group of friends or something to make you feel better.    |`|chZFmJOPaa	Post a picture? Haha.|`|q7kv0DbTaa	Nobody is ugly unless you feel that you are ugly, scary.  Start feeling handsome and attractive.  Take care of yourself and use some decoration to look gentle.|`|s2ni59xZaa	seems to me like you dont have much self esteem, so i reccommend these videos on youtube and they really work. just go to this website  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCOvP-bfE...     and thats part 1, and there is 3 parts so they will be on the side. but overall they work and they will help you.|`|XFbRLFwraa	I don't think that you need a desperate girl, because that relationship wont go anywhere.  You kinda in a way remind me of my bf.  He is actually 6'7 and is an Aggie and thought he was butt ugly; his words not mine.  He is the sweetest guy I've ever met, most of my friends think he is intimidating, but to me he's my HUGE teddy bear not that I'm short since I'm 6'1.   But, just keep on trying, I know it can be hard because I've heard some of the stories my bf tells of girls and how mean they can be.    Come out of your shell more and actually talk to people and put yourself out there. Its the best thing to do.    Dont always assume that people are thinking something negative because you never know, it might be the complete opposite.|`|ljzb6fZBaa	Candy's mom is right. Most girls look for and appreciate a gentle and kind man, regardless of appearance. The Bible says, "What is desired in a man is kindness, and a poor man is better than a liar." (Proverbs 19:22) Trust God and pray for a suitable girl for you, then rest in His goodness and love, and in His good timing you will find your girl. :) "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart." (Psalm 37:4)    Know that you are made in God's image. God accepts you the way you are - no one is ugly to Him. You are the apple of God's eye. I myself don't think I have a very nice smile, but I'm learning to see myself the way God sees me and smile anyway. Seek God's approval of you - He loves you so much that He sent His Son Jesus to die for you, that you may have eternal and abundant life now and for eternity to come. Don't depend on other people's approval because human love is fickle and limited. Only God's love is unconditional and unchanging. :)    God bless you, my friend. :)

OxnFnyqPaa	WoW...  Someone's really paranoid!     You should simply let things happen and not over think stuff.  I'm sure everything will be alright and if it happened before it doesn't always mean that it's going to happen again. It could but not a 100%.    So be happy and don't think so much about this.

e52b24b36abfccc707d535ac5027e508aa	Just because he gets a lot of attention from girls does not mean that he gives attention to all the girls. He just might be a one woman man and you might not know it unless you talk to him.|`|AA10461616	Most men get a lot of attention from women; some for their looks others sadly, maybe even for their bank account.  The point is, it's not about how good looking the man is that makes him relationship material.  It's mostly about if loves you enough that all those other adoring women don't matter.    A smart woman can spot a player a mile away.  Is he hung up on his looks or is he a real and mature MAN?  What is his history with women?  Ever cheated and claim to have a reason/ excuse?  Do he treat you as a mental equal?  Mostly just common sense can steer you away from a player.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	This is a stereotype for a reason... most men who know they are attractive cannot help but play it. The attention is an ego-stroke to everyone, even women. However, there ARE good looking men who are wonderful long-term lovers. My husband is a damn gorgeous Irish hunk, and he was a geek in his childhood and so was made to feel insignificant his whole life. But he is the sweetest lover in the world. You just have to look for the ones who are not full of themselves. ;)|`|AA11354548	it should have nothing to do with looks,  its love.|`|CEhNFBjoaa	Being trustworthy has nothing to with looks. However, it does have a lot to do with someone being confident with themselves and their situation.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Only the ones who have good loving relationship with their mothers, sons who don't love their mothers cannot or don't know how to love women with sincerity.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	From my own personal experience a resounding no. But then I only know about one good looking man not all of them. The one I almost married was egotistical, narcissic and insensitive. He was good looking and was told very often by strange women.As an example of his selfishness my Mother died right before Christmas and he just stepped out of the picture. On New Years day he did call to tell me what a miserable New Year's Eve he had because he was at a party by himself. I told him in no uncertain terms that I didn't care about that, I had just lost my mother and had much more important things on my mind.

ZNCGui3eaa	Divorce is a solution for many sad things. I believe that if that is your case, your kids will feel the same. Look at the positive side and move forward. There will be a time that your kids will question all the situations and your decision, but you need to remain focus and mature with them. Grow up with them and enjoy the journey of life. Your kids will need you married or know you still the mother figure. Later on, you'll be the in law figure, then the grandmother...etc. Be there with them all the way and that is what they will remember for ever.  **Going to counseling sessions together will be helpful, also pray to GOD everyday and at the same time, have a routine...it works, it will make you stronger and transparent. Your kids will feel the specially love you want to transmit to them.|`|BuTl5EyQaa	I read about this for interest and discovered that the following negative effects for adolescents can be:    loss of security and confidence in the future  anger at the parent who left  do not blame themselves as with younger children  may spend more time away from home  may fear loss of friends  any pre-existing tendency to depression may be enhanced  feelings of emptiness, fear and concentration problems   may feel betrayed or relieved  financial loss may lead to reduced living standards, extracuricular activities causing resentment    I hope this helps and realise that this is a big decision for your whole family unit.|`|AA11587827	kids need both parents, is one, and they get used in a divorce against each other, they get lied to, and they see alot of things that may be wrong, and it teaches them that doing wrong things is ok, its just a bad deal for the little fellows|`|vtm8lpFDaa	It really depends on the situation. My parents are still together, but ever since I could remember, they have been sleeping in separate rooms. When we went out for dinner as a family when I was young, my mom would scream at my dad in front of me and my sister, and my dad's eyes would turn red. I've never seen my parents hold hands, never seen them hug or kiss eachother. The entire family situation was really unhealthy since the very beginning.    When we're all at home, I would be in my room doing my things. My sister would be in hers doing her things. My mom would be downstairs watching tv by herself, my dad would be in his room watching tv or do whatever by himself. Nobody talks to eachother in the house.     I once overheard a phone conversation my mom was having and well it was a very long time ago but basically she wanted a divorce but she was worried that it might not be healthy to me and my sister (back then I was around 9 or 10).     I'm now 25. My parents are still together. But you know what, deep down inside, I really wished that they had gotten the divorce so that they can each have a second chance at happiness. I hate to see them like this. Lonely but stuck together. It kills me to think that they have given up on happiness.    In my situation, I have grown to be a very independent person. But it really depends on the situation and how the parents were like when the kids were young.    But one thing I find that might be a very negative impact from this entire broken family situation is, I am extremely needy emotionally. Friends, boyfriend, and career become the biggest parts of my life. And the smallest screw up can drive me into total depression. Especially boyfriend, because he is the closest to family I have.    So that's something to think about.. if you do decide to stay together and be cold to eachother.|`|HlfgMoi4aa	the kids may feel that the other parent does not want them or love them any more. they may feel that they r the reason u broke up. work with them and love them.  mildred is my leader

He lacks self confidence and is suffering from inferiority complex. As a result he is confused of what or who exactly he wants. Probably, he day-dreams of Uma Thurman or Salma Hayek but knows at the same time that he cannot get either of them! So the only option he is left with is to stick to a simple and caring girl, who will accept whatever is being offered, without any complain and give him his much needed Ego boost and be his date to the happening parties around. Don't let him use you!    He is begging you not to leave him just for the sake of the hook-up and to get the attention which even he knows he does not deserve. He is just having fun else he would never have played with your emotions. I feel you should talk to him and give him ultimatum that if he cant respect you then you will stop seeing him because you have got better things to do. Its time to be Assertive and show him some Attitude so that he learns to value you. Stop taking the attitude he throws around because, a Caring girl like you deserve the BEST!|`|eK1QCW3Eaa	You do not need to be with someone who doesn't appreciate you.

Some people believe they are mature enough to understand, but most don't really know....    Instead of trying to convince your mom, why don't you try to prove it by your actions? Just be respectful towards your mother, but also be what you are....find the balance between the two and you'll be fine....|`|AZZ0ZisSaa	you dont. you mom is obviously an intollerant ***** and cant handle the truth of the situation. thats her loss. my neighbor is a lesbian by the way, and she hasnt even told her parents, so she just has her girlfriend come over and they just think shes her friend. if you and your mom didnt get along, you should never have let that piece of info out in the first place. if i could do the flip of that and pretend to be gay and get chicks to spend the night while i lived with my parents i would have been -SO- happy lol.   but yea, dont even tell her, let her accept it on her own time, or not. in the mean time, if you simply need someone to tell, find someone else. your mom is definately not the best choice.|`|9xbpCS46aa	I would try and get her thinking about how she felt when she first saw your dad. that way she may fell a bit sympathetic but if they are divorced then don't do that because she may get worse. then try to describe your feelings an position as much as you can and try to relate to her as much as you can.

Don't let him..|`|eMBGkOB4aa	well if you really feel bad about being to close with him you should just back off a bit.  If I were his girlfriend, I probably wouldn't like a girl being that close with my boyfriend.  So try hanging out with someone else, expand your horizons abit.

1poSSvTdaa	Judging by your spelling you are far too young to be having sex. It is illegal, and he could get into big trouble as a result. So wait a few years.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	My advice does depend a bit on your age I am afraid, If you are under 16/17 it may be your nerves are because you are not really ready to have sex yet. If this is the case then Why do you not settle for lots of kisses and cuddles including feeling each others bodies if that is what you want, which can be very pleasurable.   If you are older than just try to relax and take things slowly start of with kisses and caresses and slowly move on until you feel ready for penetration. If your hymen has not been broken it may be a bit painful(a sharp sudden pain is common) and a small showing of blood but neither is anything to worry about. Personally I would explain to my b/f that I want to make love to you but I am a bit nervous and ask him to take things really slowly until you are ready for him or take the lead yourself. A few tips to make it more enjoyable for you both is to use a lubricant of some type either KY jelly or Durex do a couple(available in uk) called heat& play for your first time I would stick to the basic one and try the others in the future when you know what to expect., make sure he uses a condom and you put it on before his penis goes anywhere near your vagina, chose a place that is warm and peaceful, try to put on some nice music and relax and take things slow at least at first. I hope this helped|`|4wHjtkJXaa	you need to calm down.   Theres nothing to it jsut dive into it.  IF you have sex with him nervous/scared its not going to be good for anyone.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	ask him to gooo slooowly and use lubrication, and make sure he will stop if you asked him, and dont feel bad if it is bad the first time, oh and make sure he doesnt ejaculate in your vagina make sure he does it outside it|`|PrpLmZoRaa	just f*ckin' do it
Fnsea1sMaa	I'm really sorry that you feel like this, it must be really hard.  Why don't you just come out with it, and ask him what  you mean to him.  If he says its just sex then I'm afraid you've got to cut and run - it's not worth being in a relationship just for that, and it's gone on long enough, you'll just get even more hurt.
AA11879518	Any of those..    remember.. The Past Doesn't Equal the Future!|`|DcCECelaaa	Your world will become better for you when you help make it better for others in ways you find meaningful.  Start with the problems you see in the world and ones that trouble you in particular as this can fire the engines of your motivation.  One way you can have more impact on the world is to get involved with legislation -- changing or improving the laws so your influence will go beyond just your own back yard.  To get involved with legislation, you can search over internet for movements already in progress, or network with others to pose your own solutions.  Get to know your state and federal legislators as they are always looking for new ideas to help improve the laws and the land they govern.    Also, one of the most meaningful experiences in life is when you become a parent.  Your life changes dramatically in profound ways that will live on after you are gone.  But do it right and prepare your own life for taking care of another; don't just bring offspring into this world if you can't take care of it properly.    But if you are searching for life significance, don't be afraid to AIM HIGH.  Too many underestimate their own power to make a difference and change the world.  It's all about team building and getting things done with others.  So hone those networking skills and make as many friends and allies as possible, but try to organize it in such a way as having a direction or purpose for your life.  Many pursue money as their life's mission but those who have made it find that pursuit of significance is far more meaningful.  Develop good role models, make their strategies your study.  Then emulate.      Your essential question is "where do I start"?  I would try starting outside yourself in the pursuit of helping others.  Too much introspection leads to inaction but you will find greater meaning when you see the results of your efforts to help others.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Well there are a lot of things you can do, More details please?|`|LDfXMfyYaa	got to college and get a education hopefully that brings up ur esteem ur still young im 24 and jus realized how **** my life was and that's wat i did started going to college so i can have something to be proud of|`|r07mkYWHaa	First of all, remember.. THERE IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE!! Try starting very small things that will motivate you. Get up early, shower, eat a good breakfast. People say eat in the morning for a reason, not to warp your mind or make you eat healthy. Its because it makes you feel good, and a good feeling in the morning will make a good day. Are you working? If not, get a job, and not just any job, and job you can be proud of. One that's not going to make you feel bad about who you are. Secondly, think about what is making you feel this way? Is it what you do in your spare time, the people you are around? What your not doing... take 3 hours to think about you. Write a list or a letter about what you know about you. Think about your daily routine and write about it. Anything you don't like, change, whether its a small change or a big change. Starting small is easiest and has the biggest effect. I started painting. It's not something I will show people or brag about, but it makes me feel good. Small changes. Make big changes. Also, at nigh, take a hot shower and relax before you go to bed. don't stress about things before sleep. If you go to bed feeling bad, your going to wake up feeling bad. When Im stressed and can't sleep, I make up a scenario in my head, whether it's running into a long lost friend, or something good that will happen to me the next day. Think positive!!!|`|PuPQF8QIaa	Find out what you love to do, and try to make a career with it by going to school for it or starting your own business in that field.|`|SHh3A85haa	Enroll in school|`|SVZZ0u0paa	You hold the key to your future.

9e9f4291392994e15641f40bd2525821aa	For a lot of reasons, that's probably not your best option.  Tie the tubes might be a better way to go.  Talk with your doctor and if you don't like the answer, get a second opinion.|`|8CaOYfacaa	A hysterectomy is only recommended for health reasons.   At 17, I would hold off doing anything until your at least 25. I didnt want children at 17 either, which is rare since a lot of my friends had kids by then.   But im now 29 and want kids.    A total hysterectomy is when they take out your uterus, and tubes, and sometimes your ovaries. This throws you into early menopause, and a ttimes women need to be put on horomone pills.  Again, this is only done if there is a medical problem.     Your thinking of getting your tubes tied.  This is a procedure done to prevent pregnancy.      Again, I would hold off and wait until your at least 25. Some doctors wont even do it to females this young.  If your sexually active, check out your birth control options(shots, pills,patched) to prevent pregnancy.|`|nVcbc0dAaa	Doctor's choice. They probably will not give you one at your age unless you have serious health problems. There are other forms of birth control for women.|`|C9mmeZdaaa	No doctor in their right mind will give you a hysterectomy without having a medical reason, as for getting your tubes tied, most places you have to be in your mid to upper twenties and a lot of places will also want you to have one or two healthy children before that is an option.  If you don't want children it is comendable that you are looking to protect yourself and bringing into a child into the world you would probably resent, so go see your OB/GYN there are many options out there that will protect you from pregnancy for 3-8 years at a time.  Good luck|`|y5WzW54Naa	Unless you are loaded...which I doubt and have a quack for a doctor...which is possible...you can not have a hysterectomy based soley upon the fact that you do not want children.  Besides that, this is an irreversible, drastic, life changing matter.  Your thoughts at 17 are a far cry at what they will be at lets say...30?  40?  The biological clock may begin to tick for you.  In addition, you'd have to be on harmones which is another pain in the rump.  Why don't you take the pill or have an IUD inserted (which is coming back into vogue now).  Anyway your insurance will not pay for you to have a hysterectomy unless you have major medical problems making it medically necessary.  I doubt seriously it would pay for a tubal cauterization either.|`|BDmIunjSaa	before you think about that decision... let me tell you something about me.  I am 20 years old.. I now have a 4 month old daughter. My whole life I told everyone around me I never wanted to have kids, I never want to get married. I wanted to be able to do everything and anything I wanted to do and I just never saw myself as a mother.  Things change. Hard enough as it sounds. And I'm pretty sure that once you find a mate to marry, you will want to have kids together. Or she will.  About the age on the hysterectomy.... I believe that every state and county is different. Here in NC, you have to be 24 years old or have 3 kids to be able to get your tubes tied.   Please give this thought a few more years before you make any decisions. You're only 17.. you have years to go...   and in the meantime if you dont want children, use some sort of birth control prevention.. . nuva ring, depo shot, or birth control pills, or condoms.|`|y6xYgiA8aa	Hysterectomies are given as a means to remove a diseased uterus, not for birth control. Go to a birth control clinic and learn acceptable means of birth control. Abstinence is always a sure way of preventing pregnancies. Also if you are thinking at 17 you do not want children then you also need to look at why. 17 is too young to be making lifelong decisions. When you are older you may still feel the same way, but don't close any doors permanently at your age. Lucille
MNjWCR7eaa	First of all, you're going to have people make a big deal about the age difference. Just remember--age is only a number! Okay--I don't think there's anything wrong with you wanting to hang out with this guy. I'm sure he's a good guy and you probably need to get away from things and just chill with someone that can take your mind off everything. That always helps. I'm sure that if you express to this other guy that you're not ready for a relationship he'll understand. If not--then it's not even worth it. Good luck :)|`|8adb511f79aa7acd0f3e3f1a53293ec0aa	If he's buddies with your dad, that's not too odd.  He's a bit older than you. At 21, you should look for someone more your age.

6a9Yvrdgaa	Since most guys have the reputation of only wanting one thing from a woman, he likely went over-kill on the " I don't want anything from you " thing, so you would be assured that he wants to be with you because he just likes YOU. He likes being with you, and the fact he persued you for years, tells me that guy is so afraid to make sexual advances towards you lest you get offended after him saying he wasn't after that.  This becomes a problem in most relationships, like , Do I. or Don't I sort of thing. Will she slap me and vanish for good or what ? I really think he wants you so bad , he's going bonkers wondering what to do.    I think you guys need to sit down and tell each other exactly howyou feel about each other, put your cards all on the table, if you would like some form of intimacy, and tell him you won't be mad, but you also need to set whatever boundries concerning how far you want to go. People get themselves all mixed up because they don't openly discuss these vital things, and then the problem festers. I believe in cutting to the chase, that way you two can relax and enjoy each other, what ever that means to you both. Life is too short to not talk things out. That's my best advice Miss 27 bo----- ?|`|lv6BRCAWaa	It means he doesn't want anything from you!|`|fDdT988raa	maybe since you never paid attention to him he is trying to get back at you by "not wanting anything" and he wants to see how much you like him to pursuade him into changing his mind about "not wanting anything" he's probably trying to play hard to get|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	it means he doesnt want to put ur mind into doin wot u dont wanna do|`|DbNbWQflaa	it means that he is afraid he is going to get hurt, and afraid he will loose you for a friend, so that is good. he likes your company.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	He aint looking forward to get into a long term relationship or a serious one with u, but be friends........|`|750a7f9a5fc74b1279a1a989d8ec5184aa	he may just mean that he is not wanting sex from he just wants a relationship. just give him a chance try to hang out with him more talk about what is going on.|`|AGaeOFcfaa	sounds like he just wants to be your friend - sometimes thats the best...good luck|`|OGdyNXpdaa	It self explanatory.

8CaOYfacaa	I totally understand your feeling.   My mom passed away last fall....and Im 29, and have taken steps towards recovering...grief counseling, talking to people about my grief and pain,etc.  My sister has done a total opposite. Shes 24. She drinks a LOT, shes out all the time, and has started meeting men just for sex.......It scares me.     I dont know what to say or do...I wish i had the answer.     What i can tell you, is shes just going to have to go thru it herself. One day its going to hit her, that your mom is gone, and she needs to face the pain, anger, and issues with grief.      Focus on taking care of yourself first.....get into counseling, and on the road to recovery. Offer her the option of going with you but do not force her.

Good luck :)|`|0Wv0jYSvaa	taking him to nice restunt and get his fav food|`|GPpGCzQcaa	i know just the medicine for this case!!! a barbeque.    barbeques are amazing, invite people over, make it the charcoal kind not propane, and have all the fun in the world.|`|15cb006349f1c19f5a6f47a75b19531daa	Well check this out, when you both get a moment to yourselves, run him a hot bath and bath him,(if the tub is big enough joing him, take him to the bedroom, lay him down and give him the best massage ever, finish with his feet and hands and lastly his head(scalp) and face, and if you are really naughty finish with the best BJ ever. This usually has the WOW effect on me.  Good Luck|`|23YPEAqBaa	Yes, have sex outside somewhere - not just anywhere though!  I have found that the moment creates itself - I've had sex in the rain during a fantastic thunderstorm at night.  We were on the grass by the lake with the lightening cracking and freezing moments in my mind with each flash.  That was really something.  I can still close my eyes and see the upside-down world splitting open before me, as my man drove himself hard and fast between my wide open legs, the waves crashing and drowning the shoreline, thunder booming, warm rain washing away our sins...Pure magic!  Of course, who wants to risk electrocution?  I never even considered it.     Outside under the stars is good too.  Depends on how adventurous you want to be.      Blow his mind by blowing him till he comes, then suck it all out of him.  He won't be able to stand up for a while.  Guaranteed.    Good *uck!|`|dkKZIL9yaa	just out of nowhere say i love you and give him a big kiss|`|dc7e42a18e2b64c540854700c4afed24aa	know his fetish and do it.

You need to have sex outside your normal area, get out off town even if for a night a two,  the more unusual and dangerous the more exciting and memorable it will be for you.  I suggest so remote cabin and have sex outside.
296673ab85d1552413dbbeabae4918e8aa	Hello Nik,    At age 5, this little girl has not reached the age of consent and if the mother sacrifices the child to a pedophile on the altar of her own emotional or material needs, the mother doesn't deserve the name of "Mother" and the little girl deserves a better set of parents than the ones she's getting.    It is barely conceivable that the mother really does not know or does not believe the child.  Perhaps she's never heard that children almost never lie about such things... especially children that young.      So find the right time and place to talk to her and see if you can get through to her.  You might not.  If she's on her fifth marriage, it's fairly certain that she has some definite emotional and relationship problems, but the child's welfare does come first.  The friend is an adult and the child is not... and it's the children who will suffer for the parent's mistakes.    If the mother goes off on you, you may have to decide to give up a friendship to save a child.  It would definitely be worth it to report him to the local version of child protective services to have them conduct an unbiased investigation.  Too many people say nothing... and children are molested, raped, or killed.      If he's innocent, then he has some embarassment to deal with but gets to climb up on the hero's horse of vindication.  If he's guilty, then you have protected a child from a pedophile and from a possibly dysfunctional mother.    Tara|`|cdmMc2C8aa	The accusations of molestation need to be reported to your state child protection agency.  You can do that.  No one can stop your friend from marrying the man, but the child can be and needs to be protected.|`|R2FK48Ujaa	Sometimes the truth can hurt but it beats watching her destroy her own life and her daughters life.  You should be honest with her but don't be too straight forward.  That will make her think your just jealous and not there for her.      The key is to not think of what could happen, but use the time you spend thinking to make sure that can't happen.    -good luck      -Also think of the child's molestation case because if its true than your problem is solved anyway because he will get busted.|`|SOgEdtzgaa	You gotta talk to her.  Dont even come right out and tell her your opinions. Just ask her how she really feels a bout him, etc and ease your mind into it.    I think you can risk a friendship for perhaps a better life for the little 5 yr old girl, right?|`|59829793c75351e9021f675896045399aa	I would turn her into child protective services.  She is to concerned on finding her happiness in  all the wrong places she is destroying he child's life.   Maybe by having her child taken away they will have her get couseling and maybe something will get through to her.  Be the best friend you can and protect her daughter if her mother is not.|`|jWLOwEnraa	im with the cps thing its wrong but sometimes its best for the kids|`|AA11609393	You have the responsibility as a human being to protect all children...If you know...Then you MUST act!

ff7cbfe8a2cf6d4fb786f4648edeabacaa	It's really an individual situation.  Being single can be very satisfying most of the time, but very lonely some of the time.  The best marriages can be stressful and hard some times, but very comforting and loving most of the time.  There's nothing worse than feeling alone in a marriage.      The most important thing is being responsible for your own independence and security, so that you don't get trapped in a bad situation.|`|AA10215826	If all you are is 13, single or married is the last thing you need to be thinking about. Go out and jump rope, go roller skating, play ball or Barbies.  Have some kind of fun 13 year Olds have!  Being married is hard, but life is hard.  That's why I say go out and have fun being a kid because it will be over way too soon.  I wish I could go back and be 13 again where my Mom and Dad did all the worrying about putting a roof over our heads, paying the bills, buying the food and all the things parents must do.  Before you even think about being married, you should become a person who knows how to take care of themselves, become a whole person.  Learn how to be independent and secure before you try to bring someone else into your life, be a whole person.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Well at your age i would say "Single".  Marriage is cure for the temporary insanity called love. It is no doubt one of the best thing on this earth, to spend the rest of our life with that someone special. Marriage is the best thing only if both partners are into the relationship equally,and it is a lot of responsibility too!!!  Before you think of marriage, you have to be sure you love the person and should be able to decide if your willing to share rest of your life and responsibility with her.  Baseline is no matter if it's friendship, love or any relationship Trust & Understanding is the key that will keep it intact, you lose either, it is all shattered!!!

Ask him how he feels. If he's not interested (though it kind of sounds like he is) and he's a good friend--or even just a good guy, he be honest and not be a total jerk about it.

aef50198afeac030fbbd45d6c8fd1c1daa	The best thing you can do is to try to stay out of it. Grown ups argue for many reasons and as a minor it's hard to see them fight but at the same time you have to know that they are trying to work through something. If you absolutely want to say something what I would do is to talk to your mom and tell her that it really upsets you when they fight and that you would feel better if she took some time to really think about the situation and decide if it really is worth getting that upset about and if so maybe write him a letter that is not condescending or ask him to go on a walk or to the park and then talk to him. Men seem to respond better when they don't feel like they are being cornered.     I hope this helps.|`|YuAmsQL3aa	They shouldn't have to argue at all. But communicate with keeping in mind that each person is an individual, that has needs to feel loved and wanted.     When each forget to let the other just be who they are, then it becomes bitter and resentment, which turns into arguments.     If one is drinking, it's not the time to communicate, it won't be clear, or solved.  Waiting for one to be sober is the right thing to do.     I am sure they will work things out.|`|AHe09qzCaa	There is nothing you can do about them fighting. However, if you do not like something you can speak your mind to both parents. Maybe you should speak with them about things that bother you and how it affects you.|`|BCjj6K5vaa	You can't do much just let her know that when they fuss and stuff how it makes you feel and let your daD KNOW how you feel when he gets drunk|`|Nq2bIZCUaa	Why don't you talk to your dad?

649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Only guys who are immature are jealous and insecure.  Guys are not as possessive as girls now that doesn't mean they don't care, they are much more protective.  You need to resolve this out , confront to him, speak about it with him and hope it would be of help.

A lot of people are confused about what confidence is.  It's not being overly cocky (though a little in a jovial manner is cool!) And it's not knowing your the best at everything.  Confidence is about knowing yourself inside and out and being comfortable with where you are.  When you accept this and stop caring so much about what other people think of you, it begins to show externally.  You're a human being with feelings and dreams just like the rest of us and that means you have value.  We all have things that we hate about ourselves and want to change.  If you can change it, then start working on it, but be willing to accept yourself where you are.  I'm willing to bet that you're not such a bad guy.  If you're willing to ask others about this, then you probably have the motivation to improve yourself and face whatever challenges are giving you low self esteem.      In my experience, girls/women are more interested in a man's ability to make goals and move forward with them than in what he may already have or have accomplished.  Making and achieving those goals is what builds confidence.  So make a list (be honest with yourself) and get busy!!!

649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Yeah it is very natural to dream about someone we love.  Dreams can't judge what you feel about him or her, It is a a mere fantasy!  Attitude,love,understanding, their actions,trust and much more changes the way you feel about a person and not dreams.  It is really good to dream as dreams will lead to reality if one works on it!!!|`|AA11395598	I try to remember that I am dreaming,  and then I just do whatever I want with him because noone can stop me from dreaming anything I want.|`|6fdf21128f9632daaecc951b337a34b0aa	Im sure they do|`|QXXItSU5aa	yeah, i do dream bout the guys i lyk, but not in the way that makes me horny, i think it makes me more attracted in a kinda fuzzy warm closeness feeling yunieandlenne @yahoo .co.uk i'm here if ever you want to talk|`|Uo0G8CsXaa	yes i do dream about him and i get more attracted to him|`|CbXDDy58aa	yepppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp... mail me|`|ktL0LbGjaa	im starting to dream about my bf here and there...but i dont usually have dreams about a guy that would like...im prophetic with my dreams. so i dont have those sex dreams and stuff like most girls would have about the it guy. but i'm gifted and blessed to have these dreams that i do get. i've had them for quite some time now and now im getting to the point where i can interpret my dreams and understand them...its great.   but if youre dreaming about this guy constantly youre probably infatuated with him...try talking to him to see what happens.
q9k7hq18aa	if you really like him then yess go for it|`|e4X4Rb8Paa	Why stoop that low...he left you!!!! and as far as your "best friend" is concerned ...Girl, she was never your best friend if she said yes to dating him...Kick them both to the Curb! You can do sooo much better.    Good Luck!|`|4wOOa0JNaa	Run away!    There are plenty of other guys, and plenty of time to find a better one.|`|0f8b887059b059b8bfcbc08102e65c40aa	No, he dumped you for your friend, he is definitely not worthing trying anything again. Chances are he will do it again. I would say move on and find a guy that wants to be with you for you. And as for your friend, she shouldn't be mad at you when she started dating your boyfriend. Doesn't she remember the friend rule about not dating anyone you dated. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|2gVSBhCnaa	move on...trust me. if he broke your heart once, he'll do it again. and your friend....what type of friend would do that to you? and, why are you still friends with her? sounds to me like you need a new group of friends.|`|4fc410d5ef2a99e76a49778535db5216aa	i don't want either. my friend slaped me. and he didnt sleep with her cynt. we're only 12. gosh. and i dont want him back either. so|`|b54f3498c5b49790abdf2ee8cc8e9d1daa	why would u allow urself back in that position????|`|AA11597175	He dumbed you for your best friend? No I wouldn't go out with him again. I wouldn't even worry about the friend, some friend. You need to find new people to hang around with, people that are loyal|`|oPY4K5juaa	well...only if you and your friend aren't friends anymore. then it would be okay.  but if you guys are friends you shouldn't hook up with him, even if that's what your friend did to you.|`|itIYjA76aa	Please dont listen to these 12 year olds telling you to go back with him, trust me on this, you dont want him back in your life if he slep with your best friend!!! Hello ?? What will he be like when you marry him and have kids ??? Think of your future children woman!|`|c85ec030efea1af8ff8b360f8e6e9d81aa	Stop being "nice" to him:     You're not doing anyone any favours.|`|A8r1DmHZaa	Hell no....if he dumped you then chances are he will do it again.....and your "BEST FRIEND" shouldn't be mad at you...if anything you should be mad at her for going out with your ex.....that's just wrong okay.....forget both of them.....    Good Luck Mami!!!!|`|lQfxbxsQaa	who do you want? ur ex or ur best friend?
OGS1kqLbaa	Yes it's ok. But it is not fair to your b/f.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Yes ..if it doesn't ruin your current relationship!There is no harm in having feelings for your ex.  but you should commit to either your ex or your current boyfriend,you can't sail in both the boats at the same time.  You many eventually end up losing both! You really seem confused and probably it is difficult for you to decide what you should!  You have to think practically and go for the one who loves you too and one who is committed and understands you perfectly,one whom you think will be there for you no matter what.  Do give in all your heart and soul to the one who is your real love and be committed to him.Don't divide your feelings amidst two and mess up.|`|c6f6119a239b4c9347b665605891ad4baa	Yes, it's ok.  For me, I still love an ex.  He was my first love and we didn't break up on bad term.  I'll always have a place for him in my heart, but I know that relationship is over and I am dedicated to my current bf.  You're heart can afford to love many...  who you're in love with is another story.|`|BB6lxDMaaa	Sure it is... as long as it is not the lusty kind of love.  I still love all my ex girlfriends.  I mean, there are still feelings, because they were all a little special in certain ways.  I still talk to and see most of them here and there.  So, yes... you can still have love for them...  just not be in love with them. (remember, they are your ex for a reason)|`|mXHqfVFEaa	wow... I think we're on the same boat, I broke up with my boyfriend to get back together with my ex, now I feel like I miss the other ex...  It's perfectly ok to still have feelings for your ex, but you and I both have to come up with a plan before we get our asses kicked... was your ex nice to you? If so, maybe you should reconsider and try to work things out with him, if he's still interested... We can't be with someone thinking about someone else, it's unhealthy and unfair. I totally understand your dilema.  Best of luck to you!
dTkK58Ataa	i would not hesitate to date a man who was going bald if he was hot and nice in every other way. If its long maybe you should cut it off and then just let the rest fall out? If the guy had a great personality and good looking i would date him even if he was bald or going bald. I never really liked bald men but if the guy is good lookin why not?|`|984ee883727e20a32ddb47d260772eb5aa	I personally think bald guys are kinda hot....just depends on the girl....good luck|`|FOZ3wQqNaa	Yes!!! It is no matter to me. I like a guy who is really balding not receding. Chin up confidence is everything, and SEXY|`|XpWVwcLfaa	Some women think bold men are really sexy, so don't knock it you could be the next Yul Brynner. What a sexy man he is. ETC ETC ETC.                  Dr KNOWITALL|`|AA11675547	My high school sweetheart and fiance has a receding hairline and is super HOT!|`|z4KGoQAlaa	it can be sexy|`|ocdJpeSDaa	my boyfriend is bald and he is the sexiest guy i have ever met. i can't get enough of him. beautiful smile, amazing personality, and bedroom skills. if you're not self-conscious about it, and you carry yourself with confidence people will always want to date you. no worries.|`|b6693dbcd616ba8acca78a3377d0e4dcaa	my dad allway said!!!!!!!  THE MORE HAIR HE LOST   THE MORE HEAD HE GOT|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Yeah I see no harm going along with a guy was receding a little bit.One fine day all of us would have to go through the same.  As a matter of fact it really does look cool and sexy for the ones who carry it very well....  Receding hair line or long hair won't change the kind of person you are,so it is up to u to decide what you would do with your hair.  Trendy and cool is more about the attitude one has and not his appearance.
KtMiYtYzaa	for know, forget the cliques.  which friend can you relate to the most?  which one is there when you're feeling the worst?  which one will stick with you through whatever?  and who's gonna get you to do the right thing?|`|cd4528e97549624bab7678bdb20d390faa	 2|`|Hyhaarq7aa	you should definitely go with k because to me she sounds like a real friend and maybe there wont be that much drama and go with k because it sounds like you have more things in common with her and remember you don't want to be hanging out with a bad girl like m(boy crazy) because then she can become like a slut and believe me you don't to be with a friend that's a slut so just go with who you want!!!!!!!|`|8MQCA3Gpaa	I don't think u should choose. I think u should just have 2 best friends. When I was in high school I had 2 best friends, sometimes I would hang out with one best friend and her group of friends and the other times I would hang out with my other best friend and her group of friends. That way u get the best of both worlds.
JiQBnehYaa	I NEED HELP TO BUT IF U LIKE HEM AND U DO NOT WANT TO TELL HEM DO NOT TELL HEM.. BUT IF U WANT TO GO TO HEM AND SAY AND SAY I LIKE U AND IF HE SAYS I DO NOT LIKE U THEN I'M SO SORRY...|`|AakDEbwwaa	He's gay. Move on.
554558a31e29693704b27a8d4752ec92aa	You're messing around right? making fools out of anyone who believes it. 'Cos if its true, and she ever finds out, you'll have no testicles to speak of.. If it ain't true, then I hope you enjoy reading everyone's responses and laughing quietly to yourself|`|a9e88b188ab0a1b51ef63361e4bf7330aa	I hope she gives you a quiet evening alone, while she is out banging your best mate .|`|042a6fb9d6a9bacea652fd0d88834824aa	yes you should feel ashamed. i cant believe you would do that. honestly, think about it, do you really think that was the right thing to do. and think about it like a normal person not a perv. dont YOU feel ashamed?|`|AA12293805	sad numpty|`|AakDEbwwaa	Wtf? Tell your wife to call me. I'll arrange a great divorce settlement for her. You're an idiot.
lHgWGfQhaa	If he is really busy with work, it should be alright. Of course, you will feel lonely. Do express this to him. But at the same time, you will have to remember, he is slogging out there because of the family, because of you. He wants to be able to give you a better life.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i would wonder what there is at work that took away his time with me, personally i would go there and see what it was.|`|c82be9f8b06a325889e72909f57bb30eaa	my husband does that most of the time.  right now he works from like 8 to 5 but later on he'll be gone for weeks maybe even months.  It really does bug me and I have told him about it.  it gets really lonely.  but I love him dearly and if he's doing what he loves, then I'll be here for him when he gets home.  as long as I'm the one he's coming home to also.|`|ZQiwgdRaaa	depends on his job I guess, my husband is military and work comes first....he doesn't have a choice in the  matter and I knew that  when I met him. You have to support him, he is working for your future and retirement. If you want to spend more time with him take him dinner to the office and eat with him, meet him on lunch occasionally, plan a date and stick to it don't cancel. If you want more time MAKE more time don't sit around and wait for him to do it beause it won't happen.|`|TcE5AC7Caa	My husband does spend most of his time at work, and has done for all of the 25 years we have been married. His normal workday is supposed to be from 6.45 - 16.45, but it rarely is anything like that. Some nights he works until 2 in the mornings, and goes back again at 7, other times he will be home for an hour a day, just to have supper, and then go back to work. Some times he does not even come home for a few days, just has a nap here and there at work. He is hardly ever at home over weekends, and even when he is on leave he may be called in to work. He doesn't enjoy it any more than I do. However, I knew the nature of his job, and the hours he would sometimes be working, before I married him, so really can't complain about it too much. It does get lonely, but having the children to care for helped. Now that they have grown and moved out, I get lonely again, but  I have friends who help me pass the time,and I have learned over the years, to keep myself busy, and to enjoy what little time I do have with him.
AA12377184	Will need to see pix, before I can answer!!!|`|lHgWGfQhaa	ask the guy if he is more interested in a relationship with you or the size of your boobs!|`|AA12035186	Sounds like you are too slim.  Guys generally don't prefer "bigger" women.|`|43ffb069d587a02815961cb6fd180171aa	u are just meeting the worng ones i guess.  i'm a big girl.  alot of guys like me because i have curves, im not all slouchy and wobbly, but i have guys telling me that i look good for how big i am but they just like slim girls.  it goes both ways u see, everybody has their own preference.....believe me u will find a guy that likes u just the way u are.  just make sure u like the way u are b/c that's what really matters....screw what a guy thinks!!!lol|`|6be7JXFpaa	buy three tubs of ice cream and pig out|`|756eYktxaa	don't be uncomfortable with yourself. being slim is always any girls' dream. i believe there are girls who are willing to switch positions with you. if you really wanna gain some weight, you might wanna try some weight gain drinks or supplements. i have some friends who drink it & it looks effective. :)|`|b832a5703cda0bc3117c9957e12d1ce7aa	Don't stress. You'll find a guy who is crazy about who you are in (almost) every way. Especially when it comes to something like this. Don't worry.|`|AA10919696	why are u uncomfortable being slim, ppl go thur lots of operations to get slim these days, infact i would love to go out with someone slim|`|KRPH5t2zaa	don't worry about them. if someone can't like you for who your are then they are not worth your time. also don't spend too much time thinking on what they said. the most important thing that a person can be in regards to their body is comfortable with it.|`|dfb5eb2db7bfdfcaea82a2ccf7e0dafdaa	I'm not a man but all I can say is be comfortable with yourself, no matter what size you are! I've relized that over looks most guys want personality! A girl can be drop dead gorgious but a complete *****, why would he keep her around, beauty fades. As for guys liking bigger girls... big girls thing the same thing about skinny girls. Who knows, it's all prefrance of the guys. Just be yourself and screw everyone else~|`|TDpB9Folaa	yeah alot of times girls are too skinny, alot of guys like that but most guys i would say just like in the legs and butt its alot hotter if she is more shaped and not too skinny, thats my opinion, just do some squats... add alittle weight... do 3 sets of 12,   3 - 4 times a week with whatever weight get your legs/butt burning pretty good at the end of doing that... then if you are getting too big or it isnt helping just tweak it! more weight, less reps (for bigger) or more reps less weight (for more toned)|`|bdf49c7a73dc3f7da66b0474658b4085aa	Men like women that have a healthy build generally. Women on either side will find men wanting them to move closer to that build.    If you want to put on weight, but have a high metabolism and a small appetite, try working out. Doing some low resistance weight training will put some more muscle on you and keep everything firm.     Before doing a workout make sure to have eaten a meal an hour or so in advance, to have the energy for your muscles to use. Then when done your workout have something high in protein, like eggs, beans, nuts or meat (preferably chicken or fish). Doing weightlifting will help you to put on good weight, unlike doing a cardio (biking or jogging) workout which is better for burning off bad weight.|`|9120e028e96f46b8506bc3bdca97cecfaa	Well would you go out with a guy who is shorter, wider, younger, than you? Maybe, maybe not, the point is it's their preference. Now if you are dating a guy and he's trying to get you to change your shape for him, dump him, you dont need anyone in your life who cant accept you for you. Learn to love your shape and that confidence will attract the guy who appreciates a slim chick!|`|GWDVb65xaa	Well miss no offense or anything, but your looking at yourself in the wrong ways. It really depends on how you look at your self, and how you show yourself to other people. Your right their are alot of guys that like bigger women, but that guy isnt for you. I am very sure you would want a guy that wouldnt look at you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, or a guy that would truly love you and would never hurt you. I am sure that you would want a guy who would help you with your problems or would cheer you up when your down or just a guy that would be nice to talk to or is nice and kind. The truth is miss I am this guy and have alot more good qualities. there are plenty of men that wont hurt you or look at you in a disgusting way. I look at the inside, and im sure you have some really great qualities that you can bring to a relationship. I really hope this helps. So good luck miss! If you ever need advice or need any ?s answered please feel free to ask I will be very happy to help in any way that I can!!|`|wrSHyCKWaa	Every guy likes something a little different. If a guy doesn't appreciate you the way you are. Dump him.
8e172b6c31ab6ae5c86bf9d69e21ee6eaa	They're non-commital, so why take these relationships seriously. If they really love you like they say they do, they won't be able to stand a few days not contacting you. People can easily say the three words over the net, but the question is, how many of them really mean it? Find someone who give you the attention and love you deserve. You'll feel loved when it's real love.|`|AakDEbwwaa	Get a life, Sweetheart. A real one. Not an internet one. Chances are both these guys are either married or losers. Find a hobby. Join a class, a gym, a martial art, something. And, yes, ditch the two losers and start interacting with people you can actually look in the eyes. If you're determined to meet someone online, then go with a dating service and meet people in your area. Good luck.|`|HCEsXIoYaa	ahh,  jeezuz.   I'm so glad i was brought up before the internet became "the place" to socialize|`|my1csZ70aa	yes! you are doing the right thing, but if you really want one of them and you believe he is your mate and you can tell him that and don't get a response , then as you know it may seem like you will be alone forever but your mr, right for you will come along, plus see inside yourself and see what you may have said to chase them away(maybe not for sure)
AA11159960	he's saying that your pretty and maybe wants to go out with you|`|EM2BDAuiaa	He said that because he notices you eyes and he thinks they are pretty!|`|8flZiNjlaa	i have NO clue, maybe he likes u?|`|AA10685111	Don't read too much into it.|`|4ff0fd7bb74640e1958bcc90b8338320aa	I think he just knows you do yoga, and was just teasing you. The only way to find out if he likes you is to spend more time with him|`|fpGhb7tWaa	He wants to do yoga with you!!!!!!!!  Can/t you read between the lines!  Do you get it?|`|AakDEbwwaa	What?

He's obviously not the guy for you. He sounds a bit in-mature.|`|AA10460753	OMG! That was totally rude and inappropriate! I think this is his jerk way of telling you he either wants to go out w/ you or hook up in some way.  Don't send him any "I like you" signals.  Don't flirt, and please tell him tat he was very rude and inappropriate in what he said.
AA11426515	It could be true that he wants to spend more time with the kids but it could also be a lie to take time off to see someone else. Since both of you work at night, can you try to meet his family during the day on a weekday? Or, offer to meet his mom and the kids in his mom's house. If he flatly refuses or panic, you know that something is wrong. He won't be able to put up the pressure from you. Soon, things will surface. Don't just accept his reasons if you are uncomfortable.|`|AA10463574	You deserve so much better ! this guy seems self-centered, especially since you have talked to him about this issue.     I think that you would enjoy a relationship with a guy who WANTS to be with you and your kids as much as possible. Now move on pretty please !!|`|O1jXv1GJaa	mabye suggest something on the weekends that can be done to involve your kids and his, ex. mabye spend the day at the zoo|`|a42b8ee1050774b126e89bd432ff5000aa	probably not. don't forget there are more fish in the sea. you sound like a really nice person. get on with your life i am sure there is a lot of other men out there that would appreciate you. good luck|`|PWX9EfMNaa	i hope you know where his mum lives because you are going visiting. try to get him to invite you to one of his weekends with his kids at his mums if he doesn't let you come along let him go there are plenty more fish where that one came from|`|e580826df17f3704fba647e95ef4376caa	It sounds like it could any number of things...(a) he's married which is way bad.  (b) he's not as into you as you are into him... he sees you as a friend at work, that's it. (c) he's scared of getting hurt again.  Men hurt as much as women do, but rather than get back on the horse, so to speak, they hold that hurt inside and protect themselves, build up that wall and try not to make a commitment and get hurt again (d) maybe he isn't over his ex yet - no matter what she did.  If you really care about this guy, be his friend and if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen.  You can't make things happen and have them turn out right.  Some things are just meant to be.  Good luck, you really sound like a sweatheart with a big heart and you sound lonely and ready to try again.  I hope you find the right one.|`|zPOO2vHBaa	i think he could be telling you the truth, but he also sounds very immature. are you sure you want to be "dating" someone like that? actually, i know someone like that. he takes his kids to his mom's every weekend when he has "visitation". i believe it's because he doesn't know how to spend time with them! he doesn't really know how to be a father and puts it off on grandma to "entertain" his children.  otherwise, like you said, he would at least take them out, maybe get together with you and your children, etc.  maybe his mom is doing his laundry, feeds the kids, whatever..but i think that is the problem.  doesn't sound like a good match for you, hon.|`|wREVVCIYaa	He sounds married to me!! Have you been invited to his place or to an outing outside of work? If you do not have a home phone number and you are restricted in time that you can contact him indicates that he's married!! Where's the  mom? He didnt have those kids by himself so "baby momma" has to be around somewhere!! Sounds like you are just a "side dish" and not the main course!
AA11426515	In every relationship that ends, both parties will be affected. They will go through a mourning phase but they will heal and move on eventually.    I understand your feelings of insecurity about your boyfriend's ex being charming and beautiful. You wonder if he will compare both of you and still think of her.    He got dumped and the person that is with him now is you. He may think about her once in awhile but the person who is making him feel good again is you. Looks will fade but the goodness of the person remains. So, don't worry too much about what he is thinking. Don't act out your jealousy as this is the easiest way to piss him off. Instead, concentrate on enjoying the relationship and make him feel good again. He will appreciate your efforts to draw him out and help him move on.    Good luck!|`|AA10959632	nope. not easily or at all. i have an ex from years ago that is married, i am marries, we both have children, and his wife hates be because she's not me. i don't have anything to do with him anymore, but it's there. i always tell people in your position not to get serious with someone who is rebounding. i'm telling you the same thing.|`|AA11118580	First off - I think it's inconsiderate of people to tell you how beautiful and charming his ex is.  Second, yes he can get over it, and looks are not all that matter.|`|jqXmk59haa	Head for the hills. You don't want to be in her shadow. He needs to get over her before he starts dating again.  And you deserve better than that.
AA11426515	She wants to keep you as you can offer her stability in the relationship. She also wants to keep the relationship with the married guy because she enjoys it. Looks like she is a selfish person who only considers her own feelings. I bet this married guy doesn't know about you but you know about this guy.    I am surprised that you put up with her nonsense and allow her to carry on like this. I know you love her and rather put up with it than lose her.    Initially she talks nicely but when you asked further she gets angry and now she doesn't like you calling her and say you are disturbing her.     She is an ultimate selfish pig - leave her. You deserve someone better. The married guy is probably playing with her and will eventually leave her.|`|AA11618542	Although you guys can ride it out in a tri relationship for some time, there will come the day when she will have to choose either you, or her husband. So she might as well decide now and get it over with. If you guys keep on having a secret relationship like this, and her husband finds out, it won't be good. But it really depends on what you really want and think she should have. If you truly want her to be happy in a married life and have a stable relationship with her husband, then don't bother talking to her anymore. If you love her a lot and think that you guys can be happier together, then she needs to tell her husband and get a divorce so that you guys can be together. Whatever you do, you need to do it asap so that everything can be fixed and be the way you want it to be.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	the big question you need to be asking  your self. why are  you with someone one that  with you, and also seeing  someone else that married, , you deserve to  be with some  that truly respect you, this women does not know the meaing  of respect. and the fact that she tell you  when she with him  is a lot bull crap, to say the least, she  is using you, and you  need to kick her to the curb. better yet if you so like him so  much, then he can have her.

Talk about it, and well give him time!|`|QHplWsWgaa	You have some pretty good answers already, but here is my two cents worth.  Look at your self in the mirror and ask yourself if you really like thiis guy, or do you just just nered friendship and companionship after you broke it off with your fiance.  You were wiith him for siix years.  Maybe it isi just no fun being alone.  But that would mean you are just using him, and he iis using you.  Maybe you can be good friends, but can you really be together in a long term committment?      A breakup after so long is a hard thing.  You need some time to recover.

I would say he never really liked liked you to begin with. I am sorry to say,but I would move on. You deserve someone who would after a couple months of messing around wouldn't want to jepradize something good.   Let him know that he's hurt your feelings very much,and that you don't know if you can trust him again. If you feel as though you want to give him another chance,than do so,but you would always be wondering if he is with someone else. Remember: Fool me once,shame on you,fool me twice,shame on me.

What you can do is listen to what she has to say about you, and take the critique and work to better yourself.  If for whatever reason she is not responding to you, be confident, don't let her get the best of you, and if you have to, move on.  You can't make her do anything.  What you can do is get to know her as a friend, and maybe perhaps one day she will come around for you.  By knowing her as a friend, she will gain respect for you and knowing her over time is never a bad thing.

Being friends first is not a bad idea after all.|`|AA11466759	Do NOT pester boys right now.  You are ready for this, but boys ARE NOT.  Let me tell you a story that happened to my brother's friend.  There were these girls that thought he was really cute, and they phoned him up every day.  He got really mad at them because they wouldn't stop calling.  That's called harrassment.  So he got his friends together and they went over to one of the girl's house (the girl that was the worst at calling him up even though he told her not to do it any more)  There was a bad scene, and he ended up threatening her and her parents because he was so fed up.  The police were called, and the situation had to be controlled that way.  So be careful about pestering boys all the time.  Try not to allow your rampant emotions cling on to people you don't really know.  If you truly love him you will let him be and let him do what he wants when he wants.  Let him be the first to make a move.  If he doesn't then he was not for you.  cold and cruel, I know, but it is a stage that all girls go through (very overly dramatic) and it will pass, but it has the potential to blow up in your face BIG TIME.

I would want to know why you liked me, to make sure you liked the real me, and not who you think I am. I'd be willing to settle on a few dates to see how we liked each other.    Timing is very important. Don't tell him when he has a lot on his mind. Maybe a Saturday morning right after he finishes eating breakfast would be best. I'd suggest that.|`|85198137f096a3aeb24f22a0fc32efeaaa	Ask him out. I'm always relieved when a girl asks me out insted of me asking them. Maybe he likes you to.|`|AA11837342	Theres nothing wrong with you. Guys do experienced that kind of feeling too. All you have to do is reading the signals right. When youre making conversation, sees that he pays attention. See if he replies all your acquaintance. Walk up to him and greet him nicely is always the greatest icebreaker. Slip in nicely to give him some signs that you have paid attention to him all this time. Give attention, but not overly it will scare him.|`|AA10529795	When I was in Jr. High I had a crush on a guy and the next year he moved away.

Most guys are going to WANT to kiss you..there's probably little chance that he will pull away.  Now, gaining the confidence to do it is a whole different story...then again, you can always verbally hint at it to him and see what his reaction is.
cf2e5e167578e0dadb8f5f1ffd6d6016aa	Hunni reguarless if he is being mean you know that he still loves you. I just went through this but I lost my baby. Yes you should still buy him something for Father's Day..he is still the father of your child and you still love him and in the mean time of his attitude you still got to show him that you love him but dont let him walk all over you. Just be careful and yes be the bigger person...understand that the news of a child might still have him inshock but he is trying to hide it with anger.|`|0a976b118079eb478734e83be5268b5caa	Sweet heart...leave the jerk alone.  sounds like he needs more than a gift card to make him a father!!!!!!!!|`|f6faf00ed2d780ff513bf138528479acaa	From what it sounds like...the two of you may not have a healthy relationship that you may need to get out of sooner than later.  You and he will always be linked because of your child.  Do you want your child to see the two of you fighting or having a friendly relationship.  Speaking from experience, I would go with being the bigger person.  I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter and although I am not with her father any longer, I make attempts to have a friendship with her dad for her sake.|`|AA11117940	I wouldnt get him a card for fathers day, he did not get you any thing, but i would send him a note telling him how you felt and remind him you are carrying his child and you would like a little respect from  him. good luck and take care of yourself and your baby|`|22c28809ab50d17bc430cb35ce32413eaa	No I would not get him anything only because you our not a mother yet you are in the developing stage, and he is Not a Father yet you have a child on the way but it has not been conceived yet, He is probably treating you like crap because he has a lot on his mind and maybe he is working hard and with your transition and mood swings you are not noticing this and he is trying to deal with it and leaving you along my be his solution to let you see how you have treated him, Things will work out and after 5 years he Loves you.
AA11334488	yeah ive had a similar experience...i ran into a girl that i havent seen since high school...talked for a bit then said goodbye...like a week later i got a call from her...i thought that was odd cause i didnt give her my number but she gave me hers..i never called her...but then got a call from her...started hanging out at her house...parties and what not...getting smashed..then ended up fooling around with her...big mistake...cause lets face it....we've all had our "bucket of yuck"....our "what was i thinking" relationships...and yeah..she deffinately was mine..and the bad part about it was that i was drunk every time i was over there and thats how stuff got started..i know that if i wasnt drunk i would stay the hell away....then she turned all psycho on me...so i said hells no...and never seen her since...but people from my generation are so immature...now granted i probably sound immature from this but im talkin they are way the f*ck out there...|`|b3b2c17a34f7d245ad335ca34a5e1966aa	Yah, once

e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	oh hon, I am so sorry about the loss of your baby.  It is a huge loss.  It will either bring you guys closer or tear you apart.  The tearing apart might be for a short time or forever.  If you both want things to get better and move closer to each other then get some counseling. If you change and he doesn't, you need to realize there will be things that you either need to work on or move on from.     The pain must be a huge buredon. It will pass with time.  He may not be mature enough to know how to grieve this loss.    If you feel it is time to move on, move on. There is nothing worse than living a misserable life. Happiness at times is a choice.  There is a great book I recommend.  The dance of anger.

When you've been together for an extremely long time feelings fade. Doctors actually found that when you first start to be intimate with someone your body excretes certain pheramones that bring you such joy. As your bodies are around each other though they begin to adapt to that and around the two year mark they start fading. This is a time in your relationship to work more on friendship and being there for each other. This is where it really becomes a relationship and not just lustful encounters. I guess the best answer to this question is when you really can see yourself without that person. You imagine yourself single constantly, not just to know what it would be like, but because you really can't stand the person you're with. Good luck sweetie!|`|420635dae1f389f98ed5021705ffa27eaa	you cant afford to invest more in a relationship than you are willing to lose. if you are asking these questions to yourself you  already know what you want to do but it is hard to end a relationship. Best thing i can suggest is to Pray about it.|`|772c5b35a17390fbd32e809628f67c1aaa	Sorry for your loss but I dont quite understand what you are trying to ask here.  What is making you think that its over between the two of you? why? From the information provided though, I can say that when you go through alot with someone it isnt easy to let go of them.   Although ''going through things'' in general isnt always the best thing, I see it as a blessing because when you go through things WITH someone, not alone, it forms a strong bond between the two of you that you cant just find within someone else that you would meet later on down the road.  It takes time and effort and its something to cherish but then again, if youve already tried to fix the relationship time and time again and are tired, maybe you should let go and atleast remain friends with him. God puts the people we are closest to and overcome hard obstacles   with in our lives, for a reason. Atleast keep him in yours.  good luck :)|`|c30eff3763411a2152cb920b38571efcaa	You know when the two of you have nothing left to talk about or when you do speak it turns into a shouting match.|`|AA10065570	When you experience a loss like this some couples just can't deal with it the same.

But if after all that you still don't think it can survive then you can say that did every thing in your power to try and make it.   Here is a web site that might bring you some comfort.

AA11629871	I would say it's over when you no longer really care about one another any longer.  If you are having these feelings, it is best to try to exhaust all other avenues before you give up, such as communicating bluntly, trying couples counseling, etc.  Then, if all else fails, it's time.  Also of note, you may want to see if you're in a state that has common-law marriage, because your "boyfriend" may actually be your husband.  If those last 5 numbers are your zip code, the same way they are in my handle, it looks like you may be in Oklahoma (Eufaula to be exact), & I believe we still have a common-law marriage law on the books.  You may have to divorce your boyfriend when you leave, or at least seek an annulment.  Best of luck.|`|9aa70c2941ee110a879131f48683bfe8aa	well that is really tough. does he try to emotionally push you away. does he show any signs of being alone|`|AA12273568	sit and reakky think|`|c601ecccc63bfc76feebe544366d3e75aa	When your tears overcome your laughter, that's when you know its truly over, when there's no longer that spark, when your heart no longer races at the sight of them instead u dread them coming around..

Is she the slow type of person to notice one's feelings....? or is she quick to take the hint? What does she like?    If she's slow, it's best to go to her, tell her face-to-face. Don't forget to be nice or you're gonna scare her away =p Also, since she's slow to take the hint, you might want to remind her over and over once a while. Another thing, it wouldn't hurt to do something thoughtful for her, which will leave a nice impression =)    If she's quick, then you can try sending her songs which conveys your feelings, or sing her some =p Overall, do something which will leave an impression on her. She'll slowly take the hint.     But of course, some girls would like confirmation, but too shy to ask, so it's best that you get straight to the point without twisting it too much.

However your friendship may be lost behind a surprise attempt.  Ask how she feels about the subject of women kissing women and take your clue from her response.  If shes not down with it there are plenty of women who love to be kissed by other women and you just might find her.  Good luck!|`|686fbb1d51f435fac08b2cc1d6a7e569aa	do you know if she wants to  kiss you.|`|27c8578becaf5f38ce8ba11fa75f35beaa	It will probably be very exciting.

AA12195034	Numerous times. Every one of them was great, but I met them in the old CompuServe forums, where I got to know them in groups of people discussing common interests.    I still think it's a great way to meet people, though Compuserve has either disappeared completely or turned to garbage. I still use Usenet for discussion forums and find that threaded conversations are a great way to get to know new people. You see what they think on a variety of subjects, how they interact with others, and you know their views on life before you ever meet them in 3D.    Yahoo has groups, too, but I prefer Usenet.    Before you meet in person with anyone, male or female, that you have met online, learn how to set up a safe call (or email me) and learn how to protect yourself, then tell the person you are meeting that you've done it. If they don't like it, you don't want to meet them.|`|1afeb46d7c6c010e7d25b1f38b194477aa	yes and it was great sex|`|8b4332de967181814b884e010ddc3164aa	nope are you crazy there are freaks out there no offense to anyone|`|1e205b184805a9f265b7b07f20dbab7daa	not dated,   f***ed.    lol ;)    went well, very well.   ::nods::|`|47e9bdc8e9900486cc531924cecc4f8aaa	Yes, and we've been together for 3 years now.|`|cc99c09ca690946829749b1b41af8d8caa	yes 2 exs|`|d0f6ce19b1145dd15ff3b5447ac7086baa	Yes...mostly bad.|`|f05b221ff049ee43ba81000b5df97748aa	nope its dangerous|`|AA11199102	i have dated about 5 guys off the net. i never actually met them but it turned out one of the guys was really nice but actually a year younger then he said he was. he was still really sweet and we were still friends but i've since lost contact with him. no bad expierences here except lots of guys asking me out and i was like "i have a boyfriend",i have a boyfriend ,i have a boyfriend already, shut up"|`|AA11251121	I've dated two people I've met online.

34593407f964966617f4503ccc4f84ecaa	You know.. My ex used to say a million I love you to me.. it kinda lost its appeal and I was kind of repealed by it.    I would suggest not using such a special word so much.  Instead, use it as a reward.  =)  when he does something you really like or impresed by, give him a big kiss and say, "I love you."  rule of thumb is.. don't say it more than once every 2 weeks or a month.    2nd advice, Action speaks louder than words.  Instead of saying it.  I've always wished girls in my life would show their love.  one thing my ex did was, she knows that i like to watch this tv show.  she planned the whole trip as a surprise and i got to meet all the cast in that show.  its something i would treasure forever, even though i'm not with her.

But telling him as much as you can and showing him should be enough.

After earning his associates degree Sheehan voluntarily enlisted in May 2000 in the United States Army as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, MOS 63B. It has been reported that he had originally considered enlisting as a Chaplain's assistant MOS 56M[2]. (Sheehan acted as an altar server during the Palm Sunday mass on the morning of his death.). Near the end of his first tour of duty with the First Cavalry Division, the 2003 invasion of Iraq began. Sheehan re-enlisted. On March 19, 2004 Sheehan's battery, Charlie Battery, arrived at FOB War Eagle in Sadr City as part of the post-invasion Iraq occupation. A few weeks later, on April 4, 2004 Sheehan was killed in action, along with several other soldiers, after volunteering as part of a Quick Reaction Force to aid other American troops [2], [3]. Sheehan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal with V for Valor and the Purple Heart [4].

Don't settle when looking for a beau, you're worth the total package. There is true love out there for the vertically challenged, though.

I'm 5'1"  and i've always always been attracted to really tall guys. I mean tall. In fact the shortest guy i've dated was 5'10" and i've only dated like 5 guys. My bf now is 6'2" we've been together for almost a year now. And all the guys i've dated said they think 'little' girls are just adorable. In fact most of them only date little girls. That's just what they are attracted to. I love being small. And none of the guys i dated were losers. They were all tall dark and handsome... lol. Maybe some of them were douches but whatever... they were still dead sexy. I dont see why you would have a problem. oh and btw. I'm small chested too... and you dont have to worry about that. i dont. the way i look at it is i'm a small person. my chest is small. I'm proportioned right. I dont want to be top heavy. and i've asked my friends too if my chest was too small. and i know they're my friends and they'll say nice things but they told me i looked fine and that nobody would even think about it because i just look proportioned. So i think you have a chance... maybe you are just running into losers. but hey i've had my fair share... just keep moving and dont waste your time with guys like that. Oh and i really believe that when  your out there on the prowl [as in you really want a bf] then you probably wont find anybody.

6da58a57ec3b9d0fdc64e03c81dceb66aa	Hi Friend...that;s wonderful for you!  Nothing sweeter than falling in love! Okay...is he just shy or mysterious? If mysterious...then solve the mystery first which will help you know him better and also will not give you any shocks later! But then again...mysterious is always attractive they say. Anyway, if you love him so much and if you feel that he is the one for you...dont doubt whether you can win him or not! After all, he is your friend and you should know him well enough to tell him your feelings without losing the friendship! It's okay to be scared and have doubts but is never okay to let the moments go by lest someone else grabs him. Tell him today how you feel about him....go to the movies or go somewhere both of you are relaxed and enjoying it and then open your heart. Well, in the worst case, drop him a nice sweet loving card...but it's not that fun! Nothing like expressing your emotions face to face...for good or for the worse, still it's worth it! And if you feel that you would prefer to win his love first...then as a good friend, you would know what he likes the most and what his passions are and so go out of the way to make him feel that you have something for him..and if he feels the same about you which we all wish for you...Bingo! Good luck my friend...wish you loving stars all the way...|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	U already his friend ( good move), u will have to take the lead, ask him out (be sutle - not too agressive).

(lol)..don't share everything at least not yet and I would suggest never everything.  Ask him to accompany you somewhere, the mall, resturant, movie, park, site seeing, anything to get next to him so you may have the oppty to converse and show you care.  Maybe he will get the point. if he doesn't he's to stupid to realize what is going on and YOU don't need him..if won't get better. Does he like you? as a friend or something more? You know there is a reason guys are shy, mysterious, withdrawn, etc, etc..fear of rejection, lack of knowledge, preoccupied with other things they consider more important...So you have to compete with these things, find out about them and address them in your mind as well as with him in a polite, nonchalant way, in order to get him to open up..(guys like it when they think it's there idea or they have done something right...Know what I mean)  It doesn't happen over night...Keep trying..Good Luck to you..wishing you success!

If i was sick, what would be the first thing you would do?  What are the most sexual thoughts you've ever had about me?

If I promised not to get upset, would you tell me at least 1 thing you would change about me?  With the minimum of 3, tell me things you like about me?  What was your best memory as a child and also your worst?.  What's your biggest fear?  Tell me something random that you have yet to tell me, no matter how strange or weird?

J4lfOSPiaa	Wow you really pulled out a loaded gun on this question.  An addiction to alcohol, drugs, anything that is destructive to an individual always makes you wonder if somehow you played a part in the tormented psychology of your parent.  Here is the real kicker, just about anyone who loves your parent with the addiction asks themselves if they could have intervened and stopped it before it became a danger.  The psychology of addiction baffles even health care providers who observe changes in appearance, attitude...!  The trigger to addiction can be so many variables that I don't think modern science can give a definitive answer as to causation.  The problem then escalates when "you" blame yourself for their addiction! You can feel so guilty that you can actually be an enabler for them to continue this path of destruction.  For example, I blame myself that they started drinking or taking pills or whatever which caused this horrible addiction so I have no right to try and ask them to seek help!  That is what I meant when I said this is really a loaded gun question and no single answer will suffice.  To be witness to the addiction is psychologically brutal to the child of a parent with addiction, and if that guilt knife is stabbing into your heart then how do "you" stop the bleeding?  The absolute hardest thing in the world will be for a child of an addicted parent  to ask them to try and get some help.  Their predilection to continue with their addiction may hinge on making a child feel guilt.  It is sad but oh, so true.  The problem with addiction is that the person with this illness must decide for themselves to end it or in some cases if they have come close to suicide by excessive abuse of their addiction whether planned or by chance - then the medical establishment can officially perform an intervention.  The problem with addiction is that the person who is addicted to whatever always feels like they know when they might cross the line.  As the body absorbs this addiction, a false sense of knowing where that line can be crossed is blurred by faulty reasoning.  Let's say if 2 tranquilizers are great, then the body needs a little more to get to that level that they first experienced so then it is 4, 6, 8...until you find them in a coma or of need of emergency care.  The cycle of addiction starts out slow and eventually escalates so that all the person with the addiction can think about is that next handfull of pills to get that cozy feel.  In answer to your question, yes, guilt rides right out front of your face when you allow yourself to think that "you" are to blame for what is happening!  Please listen to me and this is important - you must not blame yourself for the pathology that spirals out of control with addiction or you set yourself up to the possibiblity of following in the same foot steps.  If nationwide psychiatrists can't get a decent handle on addicition, then you must not blame yourself for the sprialling miasma of self destruction that has a hold on your parent.  You do not want to go down that path yourself.  Seek someone that helps you cope with what is happening to your parent and try if possible to encourage your parent to maybe "just talk to a therapist" about your concerns and love for their well being.  Sweet friend, I hope you can take some words of comfort from this because people can stop the addiction cycle.  Sometimes it takes a mirror held up in front of them to see what you see.  Observe what you observe.  Addiction to whatever is not your fault!  Let me say that again - Addiction is not "your" fault!  Addiction is a disease and it's pathology is more complicated than ascribing blame.  NOT YOUR FAULT!!! Just keep saying this mantra- I AM NOT GUILTY FOR THE "ADDICTION"!!! I pray you can find some peace from the community here at Yahoo.  Honestly, if you are in this cycle my heart and prayers go out to you.|`|hIAKXlsNaa	Of course I felt guilt at times.  I kept thinking I could do more, be a better kid, tried harder in school, ect.  This was years ago when I went through all this with both of my parents.  As for now, no I don't have any guilt.  They were grown adults putting pressure on me as a child to grow up to fast.  That's on them, it wasn't my problem.  If you are having to deal with this, I'm so sorry.  Its not an easy way to live but if you keep with you what you are feeling like and you yourself don't become an addict, then you have learned a lesson and that's what matters in this life.  Stopping the bad patterns our parents had and learning from them.  Good Luck to you! :^)
5k7BexD3aa	yes...protect yourself|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Be sure you even cancel his name off your video store account.  This can get you in ways you never imagined.  My daughter is going through this in a divorce now.  Her credit is messed up because of his one bill that he chose not to pay, then settled it for a lesser amount with the creditor.  That sounds good until she found out it went onto her credit report and is stuck there for quite a number of years.  According to her separation papers, that bill is to remain his and his only (she took all the other bill because she knew he would not pay them).  After being separated 7 months, he used her video store account (she forgot about it) and rented 2 games worth $115 and didn't return them.  3 months laters, she get a bill for $165.  She got them to drop the late fees but had to pay for the games.  This divorce should be final in March, thank goodness.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	bad thing is, if both of your names are on everything, you will have to go together to get you name or his removed. you just cant have your named removed from a bill without his concent and vise versa.  what you can do if you have a joint bank account is cancel any of your direct deposits to that account and open an account of yoru on.  but if its a phone bill or electric bill with both of yoru nameyou would have to either have him go with you to take your name off or.  Turn off service then reopen on with your name only.  but if you live together then thats going to be a problem.    the auto loan, you will have to do together especially since its a loan. the bank will hold both of  you responsible|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	If you want to end it then you need to be more persistent than he is. In some states common law marriage does apply but I think it is something you both have to agree on before it can be common.    Tell him there is no room to reconcile and he can do it nice or you will do what you have to to be free of him. cut off all utilities in your name before moving out, leave no trace of you behind or he will use it to stay in touch with you|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Watch your back. Sever all ties financially|`|AA11138696	Move quickly and quietly and separate as much of your assets as you can.  Cancel anything you can and get out of whatever you jointly hold.  You need to get out of this relationship even if you loose out and have to walk away from somethings.  You need to get out more than you need any of the stuff.  Cancel any credit cards or get your name off the accounts, do what you can before you make it known that you are leaving and then leave as fast as you can/  Much better if you can make your escape and then send him an email saying you are not ever coming back.  Remember this when you think of reconciling for the third time.|`|AA11591803	Yep...cancel everything.    You answered your own question.|`|AA11313204	just like a divorce...    start by getting a seperate bank account and have all your mail forwarded to a trusted friend or family member or maybe a PO box. start looking for a place to move to. then start canceling all the other stuff. you will still be responsible for auto loans, credit cards, etc whether he pays his share or not, so try to stay on good terms with him if possible.|`|88a3bbbf6dab801eaa5ad76bd8ed789daa	Do it politely one by one.|`|9cNUtBD9aa	I'm an old guy who can never get my head around why it is preferable to have every aspect of marriage but without its (traditional) legal protections.  I just don't get it.  I can't imagine buying joint property with a woman that I did not really trust.

KPXwwwMMaa	that's a difficult situation.    You have the benefit of having been to juvi, and you have probably learned by now that violence doesn't really solve anything - you can't beat these kids up.    The bad thing is - these kids probably know a bit about your situation, and are trying to get you to react so that you'll get suspended from school again. Don't fall for their trap.    You can talk to a teacher or school counselor about the situation. See if they have any ideas.    Make friends. Lots of them. They don't have to be tough friends, so make friends with the geekiest, weakest kids in school if you have to.     Have them walk with you and your girlfriend. Bullies are scared of numbers, and they will likely leave you alone. If they do happen to bother you, have your new friends stand up for you.     Good luck to you!|`|2UUcuhHZaa	hey eddie ,this is easy now obie told me before that you have $$$,so buy some boys to do it for you and tell them not to say who is was for then just pay them off when the job is done but make sure that they do this when school is out and the boys that are messing with your girl will get their butts kjck and you will not have done athing and no one can say you did it ,but just make sure that the boys you get understand that if they say who told them that they would not get paid .ok bye|`|iiRU9kEoaa	talk to the teachers/ coordinators /principals    or their parents :)

You don't need somebody who blames you for everything and has to control every aspect of your life.

Let go .|`|7iQ7Kkdjaa	usually i just post dumb responses making fun of dumb questions but after actually reading this, i have to ask why you would even want to be with that prick , dump that **** and spread the love|`|s4FEJiNHaa	u can't MAKE him believe and he WONT!  It's a waste of ur time.  If he's treating u like this, u have to cut him off for the sake of ur own sanity.  U r the only person u owe anything to here.  Stop wasting ur time and breath on him and move on and pursue a happier life!|`|SRo6mw9Faa	There is a saying, Love doesn't hurt. First, no woman should be hit. No woman should be abused. As a man, I no and was raised to never raise my hand or voice to a female... no matter how she may provoke me. Here is the deal, you can't make him believe you. Nothing you can do or say will change him. No matter what he will always do the same things unless he gets help and learns how to treat women with the respect and love they deserve. Some advise - go to NYC - have fun! Talk to other guys! Have a girls night! Enjoy life. Trust me - you can't make him believe.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	You haven't had enough of this.So you are going to NYC!! DAH If he lives that far away just leave him alone.He is cruel demeaning and abusive. He is going to hurt you and or your mother if you don't leave him alone!! It sounds like he is nit the only one with a problem.Leave him alone.   Do you see a pattern here? If he does not trust you now he wont later. It will not get better.Leave him alone(never mind go ahead ruin your life ,have some kids see if he dos'nt treat them any differant).|`|MiKrWuM6aa	You can't make someone do anything they don't want to.|`|C7frzO9Jaa	just dump him. hate to be blunt, but just do it.|`|gCW30ejoaa	Hypnosis?|`|JU0KEIHDaa	are you crazy? fiind someone who treats you right. your pretty much asking for it at this point. people never change. you can do better.|`|GR5Fa7Shaa	the way i see it you should move on.  Dude if the guy treats you like crap and cheats on you, then i say that you shouldn't think about him.  Get over it.|`|0iGPAUBCaa	Girl, look for someone else!!! You're not going to be able to change him and he sounds like a very bad guy. Look for someone worthy of being with you not a jerk that doesn't respect you or believe you.    There are so many girls and so few princes|`|C4wVB83Raa	no offense but a boyfriend should trust his girlfriend and believe he when she say i didn't do that|`|BlU3wMwNaa	just leave him  if he doesn't even trust/believe you, it won't turn out as a healthy relationship.  get over him and let him be,  trust is really important in a relationship, and he doesn't even respect you.  he shouldn't have told you what to wear or blamed every fight that you guys had on you.  relationships require trust, honesty, communication and love.  i dont think he's showing you anymore of that.   there are plenty of fishes in the sea.  i know you will find someone better than him (:   goodluck !|`|io4NKnyMaa	Well he is the wrong one in this whole ordeal. You may feel he may be the best you can do. You may think you'll never find someone else. But thing is? You will and life will go on. You shouldn't get back with someone like that. Not worth your time and not good for your health. Besides that you tried to reason with him and if he still doesn't believe then that's his problem.  I know from personal experience this is not the way and that is not the right person.But you live and you learn and that's what is going to happen and what is happening for you.|`|ItleV9qeaa	sweet heart u were crying when u wrote this.... u have to understand u are to good for him u are free from all pain he has brought on u and if there is any bussisness u have with him is to let out ur rage that he has let build in u. but u don't want that u want him to love u and to love him to go back the way things use to be. how could give u the advice to make him believe but the thing is he already knows u didn't u see i live in the NYC i know how ppl r here and all over the U.S and the thing is when someone does something wrong the point the finger at another person (the one there closet with) because they feel guilty and when angry at themselves they send to others. don't bother with him ignore him, u shouldn't walk back in a pit. what did he give u that other men can't..... there are better men out there don't make a wrong choice because u are blinded by love|`|mkI36iQJaa	seems to me that ur not happy with him anymore.  its normal to be jealous but your bf is CRAZY. no offense. he doesn't trust you anymore. so just dump him. there's somebody else who deserves you.|`|8nexYdUjaa	Okay, what ?? why would you still be upset and confused about this ? you let him go, which was the best choice you could have made for yourself & for him, and now you're upset because he's manipulating you into thinking this is all your fault. It Is Not Your Fault, and HE is not the right person for You, it is not the other way around, so don't let him tell you that ! please, don't let him bring you down & make you feel bad about yourself, you were right from the beginning and it sounds like he's someone that needs to do a lot of self discovery, and growing. and so do you ! You have to learn to love yourself and not let anyone tell you negative things about you. once you love yourself and know who you are, you will be so much happier and no one will be able to make you feel anything different. it will hurt, but it won't get anywhere past that. Stay strong and believe in yourself, don't listen to him. just completely let him go, get rid of this weight on your shoulders and if he doesn't believe anything you say, that's perfectly fine ! now you know that this is not worth it, and you can do soo much better =) take care, i hope i helped !|`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	You will never make him believe it because he doesn't want to. He would rather blame you because he doesn't want to accept the fact that he did anything wrong. You really are so much better off without him. People who are that controlling almost always become physically abusive as well. If you stay with him, he will. The cure for one fellow is another one & there are lots of them out there. Turn loose of this loser & find yourself a guy who respects you & himself. You'll be so glad you did.|`|3kydegQJaa	Alright!  Enough is enough!  You're complaining that he was controlling you and that's why you left him right?  Well, why are you STILL letting him control you?  You left him to get away from that behavior, and now that he's not your boyfriend you're still letting him control you!  Open your eyes!  You let this guy go because you're a big girl who is plenty capable of making her own decisions, and yet you're still worried about everything that you were before!  Obviously he's got self esteem issues, and trust issues, and those are not things that you can just get over.  He's going to need a LOT of time to sort those things out, and if he's got any hope of changing, he's not going to do it with you in his life.  The only hope he has, is alone, and maybe you leaving him will open his eyes to what his strait up uncalled for behavior is causing.  And another thing, if you go back to him too soon he never stop treating you that way because what would be the point?  You'll just run strait back to him right?  (at least that's what he'll believe)   It doesn't matter if he trusts you or not, you know the truth, and now you're free to do whatever you want without someone trying to control you.  Just ENJOY that feeling!  I know it's a weird feeling to have sudden freedom, but you cut that leash for a reason, and now you're free to run!  Don't worry about him, or what he thinks, the important thing to remember is, you did something good for yourself, and now you've got an opportunity to find someone who makes you happy, and treats you with respect!  Even if it's only yourself for a while.  You can't be happy if you don't respect yourself, and how are you going to respect yourself if you let some bossy immature little boy treat you like a little kid?  Give up on it, and move on!!!  Good luck!|`|z9x5Epzpaa	well you broke up with him so forget about him. move on. its not worth all this pain
dMMKsasEaa	hehe (: thats cute. hmm just relax.. dont think about relationship stuff with her cause it will only make thing weirder. become friends. ask her how her day is and dont be creepy about it but over time ask her if she has like siblings er anything.. like normal small talk. then later on if you wanna date her you should be comfortable with her. maybe sometime ask her if she wants to go out for lunch er something|`|91c6bKdwaa	slowly start talking to her. i would start out on like aim and/or facebook or something then once you get to know her more or feel more comfortable then start talking in person. and like someone else said. relax!|`|dXn0tNHlaa	relax.
IGgkEO9qaa	Ok, well. You said that you don't really know her well. So, just imagine her as a guy. Talk to her about things that you would talk about with your friends. If you want to you could talk to her with a group of people and kinda be quiet for a couple of minutes. Then once you realize what her personality is, you can star talking.
d3icrU62aa	how about when you're coming back as a couple (you know the time when everyone throws rice at the couple or blow bubbles), you could hand everyone lil bells that they ring as you both walk down|`|bVROvLNSaa	Our son had one of his best friends ring the bell in the church steeple  right after the vows were said - even before the couple left the church - it was GREAT!!|`|hgPmwYAfaa	if you used a church with a bell tower...when you both walk out of the church then it would be fun to hear it ring and ring until you drive off...|`|mPKDmMJoaa	You could have the flower girl be escorted by a male bell ringer, that way the bell is ringing directly before you walk down the isle.|`|yW6894tTaa	I've been to a wedding once, where the ring bearer (little boy) came out right before the bride and ring the bell down the isle saying "The Bride is Coming! The Bride is Coming!", it was very cute, and added just the right touch to the bride's entrance.|`|AA11656721	After you kiss and are pronounced man and wife someone rings the bells to say look here at the new couple.|`|DqetlSB6aa	you idea sounds good...i saw it done that way before.  the bride had a little boy ad girl run down the isle ringing the bells saying "the bride is coming the bride is coming"
b297669a7b7958048f4b9112d9395439aa	Teach her who's the man in the relationship. Tell her no. Teach her that you don't need her and as a man, you can survive without her. Have some diginity,my man!

GNQ70MEFaa	Why don't you ask the women who are foolish enough to put up with stupidity from a so-called man? Good looks and a paycheck is not an excuse for such toleration.|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Why do we need women? At least our hands will never sue us for child support.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Oh kaaay... keep telling yourself that.  What do you need more?  Emotional support, or someone to wash your car?  If you lack emotional support, you will probably want to stop living.  Sure you can get some emotional support from women, but having that support from a man is different.  It feels different.  There is something in him supporting you that just gives you even more strength.  Not meaning to downplay the importance of your female support group/friends.  But men are just different.  And when it is that one man, the most important man, the one you love and adore, then it's the best thing in the world.  And you DO need it.  You can't buy that at a sperm bank.|`|96zZlJVYaa	oh, where did the sperm come from, lady? hmmmmm|`|sgZiOvkDaa	The reason God made women is because sheep can't cook - so take those shoes off and get back to the fire, woman!|`|q2POh1dEaa	Thanks, We dont need women either. You can be replaced by a hand.|`|5ymRR7Mtaa	shut the **** up you ignorant feminist anti-sexuality pig!    men take so much bull **** from your type every DAY so back the **** off.       haha no just kidding, but i mean this is obviously off of your own bad experiences, and youre totallly judging all men right there. and think about it. do you REALLY want your childeren to come from unkknown donors, and for your childeren to never have a father figure in their life? that sounds down right horrible to me.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	ROFL, bad news girl, the sperm bank was made from man, so you literally need a man to make sperm hahahaha. PWNT!|`|ecd5b22a3f931f907d69a5b7daa4b25caa	Hey not every man does that, i do it just a little bit, like once every 4 months, that's not that much.|`|Ge6oHWQ1aa	I bet there's a funny story behind this question.|`|n1lZKTaYaa	Personally, I'm thinking the penises...yep...definitely the penises. No plastic substitute is better than the real thing or the real act. sounds like you just got your heart stomped on though, so, sorry for that. Still gotta go with the penises.|`|bNCcv2fNaa	That depends. What stupid **** specifically?   How bought this: unless you are a lesbian, no amount of sperm from a bank can replace the love a woman can only get from a man and vice versa. Also, it's hardwired into your body. Men are attracted to women and women to men. It's only evolution.|`|SVqeqbPpaa	hey ., a girls gotta get her body cream from somewhere!    lol...lol...|`|rY4Y2NUAaa	because we're stupid enough to believe Disney's lies. We should sue them.

Women are no better unfortunately but not every man or woman is like that. And I think couples should put up with much more...otherwise why would we have 50% divorce rates? It shows that there's no commitment, faithfulness and love anymore.|`|AA11159096	Nothing works as good as the actual stuff, the way GOD intended it to be.

AA12187979	Well you cold say I'm pretty handy around the house when I need to be.    My wife died a year ago and the kids don't need the competion for attention from a easy whore and I'm not ready yet for a perment relationship, today's women are too esasy cheap and often in need of a sterial dipping before I'd be interested. So the safe and honorable bet is to do my own work around the houss.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	like a rollercoaster|`|vSJIorF7aa	11 months. GREAT. 8 times.|`|mAIfKiUgaa	Not what I need so I guess it would be pretty poor.  Typically one or two times per month, but not always intercourse at that.  30 years.

My wife and I are in the same old rut, so I'll once again just leave her in the rut she loves and knows so well. I'm opting out of the poor sex life she's chosen for "us", now she can have it all to herself.     See ladies, I'm a giving husband. I allow her to have her "headaches" and to "be too tired" and now I don't bother her for sex. So all of you out there who criticize men for being boorish pigs can leave me out of that group.|`|7R8IPHXIaa	I'm very sexy and hungry for sex everyday. This happened when I was a teen until the age of 30. I had alot of g/friends and there was nonstop screwing. When I got married I had sex with my wife nearly every night. But now I'm at the age of 36 and I had sex with my wife once a week or 2 weeks. However I love to screw some other women to feel the difference and maybe have sex consecutively. Also enjoy different sex positions.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	GREAT! Sizzling. We have been in a fantastic phase for several months now thanks to the bummer economy and not much better to do.

Q0lFFHKVaa	I can tell you, as a guy, that it is best if you just tell him straight out. Don't try to give him hints or anything because he probably won't catch on to them, and even if he did, he would only resist it by trying to make you like him.     You have to tell him honestly that you have no interest in him that way, so that he knows for sure how you feel and he can move on. This will be much easier on him than if you only hint at it, causing him to be in a state of confusion over whether you like him or not.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Tell them this "I'm not interested in getting a bf now because I'm not in love with anyone yet..

If you've got a sharp guy and you know sign language.  I know you want to be nice by dropping hints and stuff. But that's like not telling someone their cousin is dead so you don't have to make them sad. They're gonna be just as sad at the end, and upset you lied for so long. So he's gonna be just as sad you don't like him, and upset you weren't good enough friends to be real with him.  Be honest if you want to save the friendship and make this better eventually.   Just ask him if he likes you:  1. If he says yes, just say you are friends and aren't interested like that.  2. If not, be like OK good, because we are friends and good ones too.  Good luck.
0mLwarI6aa	well u very responsible more responsible than adults so yeah i do most of the same things so yeah u r|`|EsnFmcMFaa	you are very responsible    you are more responsible than my cousin    she is 14|`|35rFgcy6aa	HECK YES! I am a Mom of 2 girls and they dont do any of this I do it all.... Want to be adopted? LOL!|`|EKlBQub6aa	you have a boring life.  holy  geez  muffins.    I would not wanna be you..    Screwing up sometimes makes like fun and exciting.|`|f0v3XbCraa	responisble for what,show them the list, holy cow, my hubby dosent even do all that, and hes older than dirt!!! lol well at least older than you,if the list fails, just be patient, sounds like your grown up to fast for mom and dad to adjust to|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Taylor, you're sweet2 sixteen and you're very responsible at your age,  but I'm afraid that your parents might not be detailing in this context.  i.e. house chores and all that.  What about b/f, do you have a b/f ?  Maybe your parents are discussing about this issue and if not,  you're already such a lovely sweetie sweet sixteen.      And OMG, that you can even make the word SPOTLESS appeared.  That's fantastic.|`|WhObcItjaa	yes! You sound very responsible! Your grades are great! You even make your own appointments!!  Maybe just sit down and talk to your parents and ask what else they want you to do to show them you are responsible, and just show them how hard of a worker you are. I don't do nearly as much as you! great job!
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Mark, how do you know girls only like you for your looks?    Appearances are what will first attract a girl to you.  It is then up to you to show (those girls who interest you) what type of person you are.   Do this by creating a friendship first and then a romantic one may follow.
HKFxBCHtaa	It's simply because you're 18 and considered an adult. I think it is idiotic that someone would talk badly about your friend. It isn't any of their business. Tell your friend to ignore it.|`|t7XnGkSOaa	it could be because of a different aspect of their relationship besides age. I wouldn't worry about it too much as long as they like each other.  It is also illegal for them but not for you and your boyfriend, but age is only a number right?|`|mefxIQP9aa	Maybe because you guys haven't come across anything that upsets you or makes you butt heads.    Just be happy your relationship is still stable.|`|AA12381907	maybe they have a better relationship,  and the other people are jelous|`|j5mI01heaa	because they like you more. be happy that they leave you alone and that they don't talk bad about your relationship. enjoy it|`|vfj4kyGIaa	Simple, just the fact that she's 17 and he's 20, it's still illegal, to me it's fine but that's why.
uxCk69hPaa	i have.... it's so sad though lol cause i know no one is perfect but he seemed like the perfect guy for me...i was 16 at the time and now i am 20 and i still think about him and how perfect he seemed lol|`|lIoDmnvEaa	It happens when we're totally in love.
7drjHXDOaa	I would highly recommend you get over him. I'm very sorry but it's happened to me.. you should hear of the saying "if he has a girlfriend and he flirts with you, you shouldn't be suprised if he did the same thing he did to his 'ex' girlfriend to you"|`|fyyzKKqpaa	He just sounds like a flirt, but aybe he's into you.    I think though that if he would do that to his g/f, then you don't really want to be in the same position, now would you. Try flriting back and see what happens anyways if you like.|`|AA12381907	hes taken, sorry.  off limits.  this sounds like a situation i was in,  his name was cody.|`|6XS73hjNaa	Well I have noticed that guys don't want to be single! They want to be taken...but they won't break up thier relationship until they know that the next one is a sure thing. Trust me! This is exactly what one of my best friends is doing right now!
J4W68owgaa	It means she likes the position you are in and she's trying to drive you into her a little deeper.    It's a GOOD thing. Remember that position ;)|`|QSodlfMraa	mean she likes what you doing.|`|f25peTSXaa	uhm it means it feels REALLY good|`|Fe2sw7rjaa	maybe she wants more,...|`|gRZT4pnUaa	it means it feels good to her and you should keep doing it. if you don't know what she likes you should ask her.|`|MB6dMKLOaa	because she loves it, don't worry just remember that position!|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	she really likes what your doing|`|Igpc6xBNaa	Cause she is pleased.|`|izeAVxy0aa	your girlfriend told me she's pregnant|`|y9mdCYByaa	it means that you should continue what you are doing because she likes it..|`|c5LNAi9Caa	Her way of saying it feels good? Or maybe the opposite. Why don't you ask her.
BwDyOv7waa	Try new things once in a while.|`|9dJqoV9Laa	i do all sorts of weird fun things with my boyfriend, but i think it's what makes our relationship so open and REAL.  we'll play games, like scrabble, and monopoly. hang out with eachother's parents...  go to a park, play hide and seek, go to random stores just to look around and compare taste.|`|19414b4aa128e31eef363da436c72318aa	Well me and my boyfriend are stil in school and we like to mess wit our friends together.   IT's always alot of fun,  he'll be messing with one of them and i'll think of something to say and we end ganging up on them   that's always interesting.
rMq9D06Faa	I wouldn't hook up with a girl that dumped her bf for me because I would know she has no loyalty|`|YVRXdfGHaa	I would say well, it was fun while it lasted. He can have to nut case all to himself.|`|muXOBVjqaa	I would think that I was a rebound person and she was using me to get the other person jealous. This person is obviously not ready to move on and wants to have her cake and eat it too. I would take it as it was, a fling!|`|lCAXR4Xpaa	she rebounded, doesnt like me, and i need to move on|`|yCmgu8ieaa	i would feel used
O9VN7SGiaa	its not mean its crazy but in a funny way! do it in front of his friends 2!|`|E1egDXCKaa	idk about mean, creepy maybe...|`|K4f9QQj4aa	not mean but its really awkward|`|CgwEfwOZaa	I don't think it's weird, because a lot of people do it..it just may be "frowned upon" in public, so watch out!|`|rT1Af1nAaa	Depends. Are u hot?  Lol. And how old are u both?  My number is 586-651-9947. Txt me with answers to these questions and I'll give u my opinion|`|r4m8s8bUaa	It's not mean. It is lovely. Kiss him again. Provided your intentions are pure. What else could it be? How sweet would it be for a sister to grind her brother?? It sure will not be sweet. So, there is basically nothing to kissing your brother.  But you might be putting other girls who might be having a crush on him to flight since they would assume you are his gf.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Sounds like you have some weird problem and may be should see a specialist.  This is not normal behavior.  Sort of makes me wonder what other odd things your into.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	lol no i do it sometimes. its just like kissing a baby it doesnt really matter|`|4gMmrz9maa	No, slightly odd. Unless hes much younger then you.. then its your job to embarass him!(:|`|gZ0NPuleaa	It's sexual harassment and sadistic.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No, but I question your motive for doing this? As long as its just a peck there is nothing wrong with it. But why are you doing it in the first place? And how old are you and your brother?|`|rd70xQvwaa	no, its just a bit weird and incest, no offence.|`|ujT5teZgaa	i do it all the time and i'm a guy|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	no...but just keep it that way|`|BXbnLxNJaa	it's weird and stupid|`|B9dluSbpaa	PERVERT! INCEST!|`|37PYnKr9aa	That is gross, even if you are playing! Its not right...|`|I0g24Jmkaa	It's kind of weird but if you're joking then why not.|`|0H63P4jAaa	weird.|`|fxlIUnQ1aa	yes!!! does your mother know you do this behind her back!!!!|`|xUoQgp0baa	not mean just freaky and weird|`|dvcBbL9laa	It's sketchy and incest.|`|K9K9eTJJaa	That really inbarress him! trust me|`|PK0doXNiaa	i would crap my pants because thats just creepy as hell lol|`|yUnQahGoaa	It's rather disturbing.|`|ZV3kuociaa	not mean just fuckin gross|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	no were as SHAT though...unless hes like 3 dont do it!|`|uqWdNf3Faa	its not mean.  its just really really weird. thats your brother.|`|SiG1a6vHaa	Well, if you're Angelina Jolie, you could get your photo all over the tabloids for doing just that!  However, if you're not a famous actress, I think maybe you're being silly be invading his personal space.  Find another way to be silly.
ZiHcxJv7aa	Temptations come from bad energy to see how faithful,loyal and strong we are. If she gave you the card  even though she knew u were married, then she did not care. Dont fall for it, you`ll only feel bad afterward. And make sure you change the hair-dresser ;)|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Did she KNOW your married? If she didn't know, it could have been an honest mistake.|`|VYVI9H6Eaa	all i have to say is LOVE THE ONE YOU ARE WITH!!!! or you can go with what your heart tells you back the outcome is that someone is going to eventually get hurt... i would give more info but im too tired.. sorry    i hope i helped! =)|`|R3AN5WO0aa	uh oh this is bad  dont cheat on your wife    and she didnt care if u were married or not  and the temptation just might be that u need a change    but keep to your faith to ur wife|`|TlU3zj61aa	Put her out of your mind. Cheating is not acceptable and as long as the temptation is there in your mind it will most likely occur. Focus on your wife, take her out to dinner. Remind yourself how wonderful she is.|`|MtlkMecnaa	Forget about her. If your married you need to stay faithfull to your wife.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	I think you show her too much concern in this conversation and that's why she didn't bother asking you if you're married!|`|Dkh5sUCEaa	dude you need to hit it    if you think its love at first sight then by all means.. many people who are already married find someone who they really should be with, its not uncommon. call her up man..|`|qcB23QvZaa	She's obviously into you    it's so normal to feel temptation, as I christian myself, i feel it EVERY day.    If you like her as a person, get to know her i guess, but DON'T cheat on your wife.    I don't know if she was extremely into you, or if she's hurting right now. Loosing someone must be hard, and maybe she's just looking for some sort of closure.    As a girl, if you like a guy. You really don't care if he's married or not. So i'm guessing she really didn't care that much or she wouldn't've given you her number|`|XKtjEiEraa	Why do people always hide behind faith? *sigh* First of all, this is your decision. You decide what to do, how to live your life, and if you're asking whether we think she cared if you were married or not, the answer is probably no, she didn't care. The real question is, do YOU care? That there is your problem. Why do we have temptation? Because that's life. There's the good and the bad and we live with both. Do you love your wife? If so, switch hairdressers and burn her number. If not, get a good lawyer.|`|sTqfKpbraa	she does not know you are married or not    and be her friend  dont even think of anything more|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	You may have been unconsiously flirting and she got the wrong signal.  I would just explain to her that you're married.  Follow your heart but just think about how much you might hurt your wife and whether or not you can deal with the guilt.|`|jFhh6F51aa	First of all, you are to be commended for looking for advice about this because you're obviously trying hard to resist this temptation which is a very difficult thing to do.      It is not uncommon or wrong to feel flattered when someone of the opposite sex gives us attention, even when we're married.  It is wrong however to think about another woman/man in a sexual way because this is the first step to committing adultery.    We are tempted to test our faith.  If we had no tests in our lives how would we truly know how faithful we are to our spouse and to God?  God puts temptations out for us to see if our actions back up what we say we believe or have faith in.  If you were to give in to this temptation God would know that you are essentially "all talk" and that your faith is actually dead.  As it says in the bible: "faith without works is dead". (James 2:26)  God also puts temptations out for us so we can recognize our weaknesses and then improve on them.    Don't give in to this weakness.  Recognize it and then change it.  If you feel an uncontrollable urge to call this woman, pray to God and ask him to help you overcome this temptation.  Rip up that number.  You will feel good about doing the right thing for you and your family.    I hope this helps.
lIoDmnvEaa	If you both do it WILLINGLY.
JH1nIbfGaa	1 or 3    Italian isn't very good for dates :)    Im surprised, A man that knows how to take a woman out.    I didn't think they existed.    good luck my dear-    Ray|`|uLHtXibRaa	Ive never been on a dinner date so id be very happy with any or all!lol...I got taken to macdonalds a couple times for a big mac and a coke...|`|tAxRcALHaa	do the first one and then do something like the dance thing afterwards|`|31zP0l8Waa	r u trying to impress someone with this question or are you for real. i cant tell.|`|AA11211688	:)    If you know the Chef, Go with 1.

27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	hmmm! to me it's the best love making throughout the relationship. i fell in love with a guy the first time we made love. it felt so good, it was over a year ago and i still have dreams about it, remember it like it was yesterday. the best way to me, is flowers all inside the tub, some wine and no lights, few candles. at least for me it was the most romantic. and yes it's worth waiting for the right man,|`|OwLckUE5aa	It is sooo worth the wait.   My guy was soo great my first time. it was perfect, we were in his room, it was valentines day, we were ready.  i will never regret of forget it.|`|JurXNltPaa	It is definitely worth waiting for the right man because u are not going to want someone that is going to be rough or try to make it happen so quick that you are going to forget the experience!     You want this to be a very romantic time with a romantic person. Most of the time unless you are an adult or have alot of time on your hands the 1st time is not going to be all that romantic...Well not for most!!     If you already have a mate that you are thinking about being your first experience then if I were you, I would let them know how you want it to be so that it is special for you and if they care about u, they will do as u ask! Good Luck!!|`|qQsjM6O3aa	Well if its your first time ever, then it might hurt a bit. Aside from the pain, making love with someone you truly love and that loves you back just the same is indescribable. And its the world if you wait for the right person.|`|AA10879212	it is WAY worth waiting for the right man! I lost my virginity to a boy i loved at the time, and i don't regret it. but i have slept with someone afterwards i didnt love and i regret it HUGE. i cant imagine if it had been my first time. It really is more fulfilling when its with someone you really care about. The most romantic thing about making love, especially for the first time and with someone you love is knowing that this person really truelly loves you and that what you're doing is such an intimate thing and something you two have only shared with each other. its not something you can explain really easily, but when you find the right man, and don't give it up easily, you'll know what its like.|`|wBffQgPiaa	It is a big misconception that penetration is "making love", and no, it should NOT hurt - not EVER. That is not making love, that is violence, whether you intend it or not.  Don't ever force penetration because it can have repercussions on your gynecological health later on.  If you go slowly enough, and yes it may take many times, penetration will happen naturally in it's own time.     Just erotic kissing or petting can be making love.  Don't make such a big deal about "going all the way" at one particular time.  It is usually too much too soon.|`|EMYlCPfuaa	LOVE, ELECTRICITY, DIVINITY, SOUL TO SOUL CONNECTION  do you really want me to go on?  the absolute purest love shared between two peple is that of 2 people who are soul mates and in love!!!!!!!!!!  nothing could be finer ro more divine!   JUST CLICKED AND FIT!!!    yes, worth waiting for!!! xo :0)|`|bu6BhCnpaa	it was bumpy and awkward and nerve wrecking and fin and sweaty and we laughed a lot and bumped teeth...hahaha      the most romantic thing about lovemaking is just being so close to that person and you feel good and you make them feel good and while the big o is amazing and great...the most senseual and rewarding part of sex is afterwards and cuddling and laughing and talking....cuddleing and falling asleep naked.      is it worth waiting?  yes and no...    i didnt wait...and sometimes i regret that...but other times im glad that i know what i do about sex and that ive had good sex and bad sex.  is my soulmate the best ive ever had?  no...technically speaking...but he doesnt have a lot of experience except me.  but yes...he is the best...because we connect and i feel so safe and comfortable...there are no worries and i can totally let go...    i dont think that peopel should wait till marriage if they do not want...just use discression and only have sex with those peoepl that you are in a long term committed reltionship with.
O1lm79EFaa	It's more than annoying... needy guys can get possessive and controlling too and that all is a terrible mix    So pretty much the same reason a guy will cut a girl as soon as she gets clingy and "too attached"  So buddy lol it definitely goes both ways|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	If they end up getting clingy it just makes us want to distance ourselves.  I got to the point where i would never check my e-mail because my boyfriend was sending like 5 e-mails every day.  At first it's sweet but we have a life and eventually a needy BF makes you feel isolated frfom your friends and family.
nczOLT2jaa	omg!  dont tell her husband...that's her decision, not yours  and dont continue to date her! that's wrong  just leave|`|e207987deddf27dc04449727b6aaafc4aa	Drop her and the class like a hot rock!  Telling her husband would only lead to other people getting hurt, chalk it up to experience and go on your merry way!|`|QKnKjYzQaa	You should keep dating her but don't take things too seriously. Obviously, if she had a husband, she's never taken anything seriously either, so why should you? If you like being with her then be with her, if you don't like being with her then move on. But at all times, think about what YOU want and not what she wants or your parents. You will gain experience out of any good or bad situation anyway and that will help you grow. Now, if you're looking to get married and all, then you shouldn't waste your time and just follow your heart and get out of that situation. There are better women out there dude!
52C0HULyaa	YESS she is :)
AA11737190	Yes it does. Really most things feel better when you're high...|`|34gadhWaaa	i don't get high but it feels great|`|hmSb745iaa	bad ***
cj8iM1Olaa	It depends.    When i'm in a rut, i look for anything i can have a very physical relationship with...i.e. sexy time and lots of it.    But on a normal day, no...probably not.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	You're not fat, you're big boned!    - Eric Cartman's Mom|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	You're not obese, obese for you my defition would be 240 lbs or over. Besides, it's better to have a little meat on your bones than to be skinny. Remember, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14. If a lot of people say that you look good, then you look good. I honestly can't give my opinion on your looks, but if I saw a picture I could. But to me, personality trumps everything else. So ultimately, the answer to your question is, yes.|`|q2POh1dEaa	nawww|`|sQq8q4Biaa	well most guys see it like this(not me)  Dating/fu*king a fat chick is like riding a moped, It's fun while you're doing it but you don't want your friends to find out."  personally looks aren't that important, I'm 6' 150lbs and I hate how I look but people keep telling me I'm hot and i probably don't believe them cuz im emo. but it really depends on personality and if there is a connection between two people.|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	I think bigger girls are sexy as hell...|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	If I liked her I would, but I usually don't like fat girls.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	no i wouldnt|`|5ymRR7Mtaa	i know plenty of guys that would love to. its all about personal preference. just stay on bottom, and work your thing girl!!|`|6FXJrVjqaa	well it depends how its spread my gf is the same size as you she just had a baby but still shes been the same size and i think shes sexy as hell theres tons of guys who would prob date you|`|hZL7hCloaa	it's like riding a moped... all fun until your friends find out|`|EuK1QgYeaa	It's not really about figure unless you're a .......not gonna say.    If you're kind and find good nature in people,  If you're caring and helpful,  If you're someone who listens,    You'd score easy.    ; )|`|2QFe7onpaa	If you have confidence, size doesn't matter. If someone won't go out with you based on size then you wouldn't want to date them anyway. I'm the same size as you, but I am petite. Yes, I need to lose weight, but I'm confident with my body. Flaunt what you have, wear appropriate sexy clothing, and the right guy will absolutely love you. Honestly, most men (not boys) would rather have someone who is curvy than a twig.    And congrats on losing 7 pounds! Celebrate your successes! It helps :)|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Seeing what people consider "fat" these days, yes.    EDIT: Sometimes if you love someone, you feel physical attraction, even though some might consider your partner to be ugly.|`|3H9k7tN5aa	Honestly, more than likely not. I know it's wrong because it's supposed to be all about personality but I feel of you aren't physically attracted to someone it just won't work    That's just my preference. It's a TON of guys that like big women.|`|gKvznKpKaa	id go out with any girl at this point since I have no testosterone in my body and my dick can barely get hard, the sad thing is girls wont go out with me|`|0QL7m16kaa	nope|`|sLLLqtQEaa	i'm not a guy but yes some guys would date bigger girls and don't refer to yourself as fat just bigger|`|vJZYIGJBaa	nope.|`|VWILDaYPaa	more cushion for the pushin. i wouldnt but my frend loves "big" girls|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	Honestly no. I like women who take care of themselves.  Keep up on the working out and eating right, you'll feel good both mentally and physically|`|X1V5Unaaaa	i know tons of guys who like a lil extra on girls. you just rock your body with confidence girl!   :)|`|uAPntfQ5aa	I know I'm not a guy, but I'm overweight and heres a tip.    Its all about how you carry yourself!!  Feel sexy and you'll be sexy.  Avoid baggy clothes, but don't wear clothes that hug any bulky spots.  Draw attention to your best features, your eyes, lips, and of course cleavage.      I am not a stick thin model, but I have dated some extremely good looking men.  I have those skinny twigs shooting me jealous looks b/c of my bf.  Be confident!!!|`|M6atTXe1aa	yea more pushing for the caushing|`|b5b688c4476beda0418dc03ef31c0a35aa	Beauty is only skin deep.    Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.    I'd go out withyou if we are age/compatible.|`|23bs0kAKaa	Sure, i would in a heart beat if you are a nice person, kind to everyone, turn the other cheek when people are mean to you! Its within that counts not the outside!    and ignore all the coments about your weight, be a leader and dont care what other people think
dLu51MAIaa	she wuld hang out wit u talk to u do u hang out wit her?|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	What I do is tell them directly after flirting for a bit.  I've made a boyfriend out of the guy EVERY time!  Good luck! :)|`|xfj1B7YSaa	she likes the guy she flirst a little bit extra with him. or she gives him glances more than usual. XD
sYxtPBziaa	Carry an axe with you or something. You never know when those creepers will strike...|`|tNdYtp2daa	These kids are weirdos. Watch out, don't be caught left alone! You never know what might happen. The kids are probably acting this way because they are stalker status. Tell them to leave you the hell alone. Geez,  talk about creepy. Tell someone! Lol.|`|aGa29G1Baa	duh he likes u  .....|`|hd0mp4nKaa	He likes you and his friends give him crap about it. Reminds me of high school :)|`|kULqytREaa	go tell the prinsable that there being little creepers and there making u feel uncomfortable|`|18kjvDVPaa	it's simple really it's either he likes you alot  or he's stalking you and you should tell him off or tell someone.
G4sA2MGFaa	You never forget your childhood loves or close friends. Try to chat with him thru myspace and remind him of who you are, I'll bet he remembers you and knows you knew him before his dad was famous, he will probably appreciate knowing your feelings are genuine!|`|2hhGgKBZaa	I can't say whether he remembers you or not, but from what you've said I think he would (nearly everyone remembers their first kiss at least!!).     Why not take a chance and send him an email via myspace and ask him if he remembers you, because you remember him. If he's nice to you compliment him on how great he looks and stuff...take it from there!     Good luck he sounds awesome :)|`|JukGKm2paa	wow girl this is so easy why did u ask  im 12 and know this   ill put this in steps     step 1-add him on myspace on the yellow box ask if he remembers you put your name too    step 2 - wait for when hes online     step 3 if he ask  who you are give more in info    step 4 - steal him back     - step 5 relax cause  girl you just got yourself a rich man     hope it helps|`|M8MlviOFaa	myspace him and ask him if he remembers you, if yes, ask him if yall eve wanna catch up sometime.|`|1KajpBdaaa	scan ure yearbook and send to him circle u and him|`|VH58GZweaa	yes|`|t7jiSmjVaa	Spelin troubles.

If you get along with someone, and you guys  have a connection, everything works out. I am an 17 almost 18 year senior and my girlfriend is 16 and a sophomore. So I can relate.|`|oLEYBWWpaa	Heck yes! I polled 65 senior girls this eve with just that question: Would you ask a Sophi/junior out if you both were interested or if you were and thought he was to age bound to ask you????== the answer was a whop pin' 54 girls have or would == 3 said no whey== 5 declined ==3 are dating 16/15 yr. guys already..= The discussion was brought up because a 22 year old collage man(coach) was Hitting hard on a sophomore girl he thought was a senior at a wrestling meet.(she is 17 but held back by long term illness) We voted  for total honesty and her to explore him on a few public group dates and have him home to meet mom and dad before the first of March.(18bd)|`|jSBtdhf0aa	sure it is.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Go for it because it is your life. It doesn't really matter what other people think.|`|QSodlfMraa	sure age is just a number honey.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Sure why not, besides many who are younger can act older, and visa versa. If his head is on tight then by all means go for it :)        Blessings|`|EX1GjjJCaa	I guess my answer would be yes. Because guys like to date slightly older girls at that age and brag about it.    Just don't become clingy.|`|GzlckRcnaa	yeah,you should go for it.after all love doesn't depend on age..|`|AHLUW1HNaa	Yes!    Why wouldn't it be?

Go for it!:)|`|2FhPfxnsaa	Go for it, why not!|`|NLxcfGplaa	Its ok but remember you are an adult and he is not.  Age doesn't matter.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Yeah, it's cool as long as he's mature enough to handle you.    Boys get retarded sometimes when they date older women.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	It's definitely okay, as long as your friends aren't judgemental.|`|prW1i0vzaa	Of course! A few years age difference doesn't hurt!|`|WnNpxj0faa	you can't help who you fall for.    GO FOR IT!!!    who cares anyways. its highschool!|`|AA11195073	i think you should go for it because if you really like him then age shouldn't matter|`|hd2hFdkpaa	yeahh i guess. im sure he would be really happy that an older girl is asking him instead haha.|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	I think it depends on the guy and yourself ! There is nothing wrong with an older girl and a younger guy or vice versa it happens . Go for it|`|mvaPdekPaa	ya! thts one lucky S.O.B lol good luck! :P|`|3p3otDlXaa	Yes.  It's always good if the girl's a little older, too, and you are.|`|6DloIDomaa	Its allright...i mean 10 years down the line...when you are like 26 or 27 ....and you are going to marry....you arent going to say..."OH MY GOSH...I AM MARRYING A GUY THAT IS 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM....."....besides...if you like him...go for it....|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	lol no he should ask u out?|`|Ri27AKdHaa	yeah some people like dating older|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Why not, as-long you don't complain shortly and this and that....|`|FVt8c0cxaa	Its cool if you like him just go for it|`|W05lqxGHaa	you like??    well age doesnt matter you know then go for it..      find out if he likes you back|`|WC4XTU4Daa	Sweetheart, my parents are 11 years apart. My fiance is 8 months younger, and quite a few of my friends have dated younger men. Think of it not so much as the years, but as the percentage of life... As in, my mom may be 11 years younger than my dad, but it's less than 20% of my dad's life span...|`|7iQ7Kkdjaa	conveniently 18 eh?  why are you dating down? there must be a reason, your going against the natural order of things, wait till your 27 and a highschool / middle school teacher to delve into things like child molestation, at least then you make some kid the most popular kid in his grade.|`|O9VN7SGiaa	yess it iss!|`|578e2f7a3fd2ad02982eaa05fbce0dc4aa	Just concentrate on your career.|`|6hk1R7Aqaa	The police will only *** if you do.

He'll be so confident but just don't feel like you have to babysit him or something.|`|79zndOApaa	It is fine,if you like him go for it.He is not too young.|`|V2wzcI2Maa	Ya of course beside later in life age wont be the thing that's important|`|KinqfPQhaa	it depends how much younger.
O36qjj7Oaa	Be there for him/her and when they need/want to talk and comfort them the best way you know how.    Both me and my husbands mom's have died in the past 2 and1/2  yrs and we both have been there for each other whenever one of us wants/needs to talk or just a shoulder to cry.    My dad has also died and he passed away on january 8,1994 at the age of 63.  His mom died unexpectedly in october 2006 at the age of 65.  My mom died 10 months ago on april 9th at the age of 74.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	Be there for him through everything, Let him know that he can cry on your shoulder and its your turn to be the stronger one for just a little while!!|`|5ILdSx7faa	Be there for them when they are ready to talk.  Listening will be the best thing for them.|`|LC8iYnncaa	be there for him.. show him that you care. be there for his every need cater to him.. love him. talk to him if he feels like talking if not respect that he doesnt and just be there for him|`|tcyuTHjPaa	Try to support them and just for no reason tell them it will be ok.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	support them through there grief  ,,,, its is really a time and a half to lost a parent
pnZssBg9aa	The last one was years ago, this time with octuplets as well. But one of them died in infancy. The mum's name is Madam Chukwu and the daughter that died was Odera. And no, I didn't look up on the internet. The 7 surviving octuplets are now 10 years old.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	well my last one was in the bathroom.I named them poohwee Dewey and shoowee.....|`|7foornMVaa	Nope, didnt even know she had any previous children.    All I know is, those children will not get the attention they need and deserve.|`|XTBlOf9baa	All I know is Nadya Suleman, the one that's in the news now. I'm sure in a few weeks I'll forget her name altogether. All I know is that 14 kids for 1 single parent who clearly can't support herself or her kids is too many. Child protection services needs to get involved. ASAP!
UCKAiLN1aa	Dark hair, light eyes, light skin. Someone with toned arms, back, abs, legs. They don't have to be muscle men, but someone who is healthy and who is fit. Tall! :) Good hygiene - clean mouth, hair, and everywhere else.|`|V59AiHpjaa	my fiancee has light brown hair light blue eyes he's deathly skinny ( i hate that) and is about 6 foot. oh and he hates showering everyday. lol|`|32WSjLpkaa	Appearance wise? I like long, soft, skater hair. I like nice eyes and a nice smile that he isn't afraid to show off. I look for strong arms and a strong back, to know that they are confident and can protect me. I look more at personality traits though, charisma, compassion, sense of humor things like that
uWAfvTgMaa	General Flirting Tips for Girls     Tip 1   Get out there! A lot of people are asking and even whining that they have never met anyone only to find out that they spend most of their time crouching in the sofa with a romantic movie and a pack of popcorn. Hey! Wake up, people will not just knock on your front door to meet you, you have to go out and be the one to meet them.     Tip 2   Be interesting by also being interested with them. If you want them to communicate, LISTEN! People like people who would listen to them when it's their time to talk. Remember, listening is a part of good communication.     Tip 3   Let them know or feel that you are interested with them. Someone has to make the first move and the simplest and safest way to do that is to SMILE! It's a nice way of telling that you are interested without being so hanky.     Tip 4   Always gives them a reason to talk to you. If you would like to meet people, you have to make sure that you have something. Wearing or bringing something that can catch their attention. Carrying something that you are interested with is a good point. The conversation can start from there.     If you have already opened your mind to the basic tips on flirting, then you can plan where to do the flirting tips above. There are several places where you can start practicing how to flirt with guys.     Great places to start flirting with guys are parties (social occasions, functions or celebrations), drinking places, learning places, workplace, participant sports / hobbies and spectator events. You can do it anywhere.     Here are some good flirting tips for ladies, girls or even teen girls. I have included teen girls because we basically start flirting during our teen years.|`|COmp4sIuaa	wink a lot. Your eye should be numb.|`|GeUAhqXpaa	keep cool. are there any signs that the guy likes you? cuz if he does then you have a good chance, just ask around and see who he likes and if its you, you might have to make the first move|`|kWIqDkB9aa	Just say hey! If theres something between you the conversation should flow easily :) So get texting!|`|FyFDp5Jlaa	Just text him and let him know how you feel. Don't get to sentimental because they might run away.|`|Brcp97V7aa	Have a friend ask him out for you. Make sure your not around when he gives an answer. If you get rejected say you got dared to ask him out or your friend did it just to make you mad. 3rd choice: Let people think what they want tell him you like him and just don't care if you get rejected!|`|YK5y5m51aa	Start with a hey and then ask him how his day has been? Then find your way around the "maze". Remember, a text message is like a bikini, what it reveals is very suggestive but what it conceals is extremely vital, hehe!     Good luck|`|qIDCTks1aa	alot of smiley faces and winky faces|`|H86W4AuOaa	just text him a "hey" and eventually work your way towards the "we should hang some time" text.|`|L3tcl7ztaa	well, always start by saying "hey, what are you up to ?"  and use lots of fce emoticons like   :(  :)  :D  ;)  :P  its flirty.  ask him about his sports and if he ever asks you who you like say  well, you..  good luck!|`|yCmgu8ieaa	tell him you like him in these words "hey, do you like me?"  then its perfect if he wants to just be friends and says "no" then just say "o, ok just wondering" and if he says "yes" say "i kinda like you too"
oil8ALh4aa	I like how come guys can be so clueless and yet they'll pretend they know what they're doing    but i hate how some guys can be so damn cocky|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	what i like least about guys is the fact that they are so hard to figure out and learn how to "woo" yet with girls, it's simple. Which girl isn't going to fall for a guy who does and says sweet things, kisses on the forehead, all of that stuff.   However, i do like boys... as much as they suck. simply because they are so hard not to like. Especially when they are witty and charming, smell good, and are just fun to be around.     very generic answer, i know.|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	i like when u can make jokes and they don't take it so serious|`|0V2UrTqoaa	physically: dont care  personality: when they are "humerous" in an abnoxious and annoying way.  when they dont notice me|`|YK5y5m51aa	Their softness and generosity|`|2hhGgKBZaa	Physically:   Best- Eyes and smile, nothing in particular as long as it suits them ;)  Worst - If they're too skinny! I'm a skinny girl and bones against bones dont work lol    Personality:  Best- Nice guys, who can hold an intelligent conversation but don't take life too seriously  Worst- Controlling/guys who ignore me, I always listen to what my man has to say and i expect the same in return|`|gCOeaD9raa	I like guys because of there penise and they seem to have more fun  but I like girls becase they get to wear prettier clothes|`|zMDkllJvaa	i like women because there soft and nice they cant get there **** together though or make up there damn mind|`|bG8mEUHhaa	i dnt lke conceited girls, or girls wit real bad attitude. but i love a girl with sexy lips n eyes. n girl dat lov having fun n open minded. the rest of a female body are great too. oooo n a turn off is a girl with no confident in there self.|`|y9mdCYByaa	Like the Least:  * Cheater. Some men find it hard to accept that no woman is perfect that's why they resort to cheat. They couldn't and wouldn't be able to find all the things that they are looking for in one girl.    Like the Most:  * Responsible. If they know they are wrong, they take the responsibility to make-up. If they are not wrong, they still apologize.. :)|`|ltdPoFsyaa	Physically it doesn't really matter to me, though face is important :)  Personality is key and it's not often you find a girl with a good one...  I know of girls who kind of do have great personalities but they are also regular old girls. Mean, ignorant to my existence, uncaring, cold, etc.
BO3KBsPIaa	Tickets to see his favourite band, a suprise weekend away, an item of clothing/trainers that he has said that he likes, but hasn't bought, ipod with his favourite songs on it, a watch, xbox games, massaging gaming chair, magazine subscription, hire out a really bling car for the day for him (lotus?).    Well, none of these are very unique, but you know your boyfriend better than me! Ask him what his idea of a perfect day would be if money was no object, and take inspiration from that. You have got him some great pressies, hes a lucky bloke!|`|p0ioXUM2aa	no knickers and keep flashing him during the evening getting him really excited....................................
kQ24NaG9aa	beautiful beautiful david beckham!|`|6iuZEUhzaa	michael doleh of the penn state nitnay lions!|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	The most adorable female athletes are the figure skaters and the gymnasts! Sorry, don't know about guys.
K3W3f3jtaa	Well Jordan should'nt have done that, cus when you really like somebody, you don't give up esily, u have to fight for wat u want! i had "wanna- be friend" that tried to break up my bf and me, but i didnt let her get in the way, now all she does is talk ****...so if you guys really like each other you should let anythingor anyone get in your way..
HlRWA3JHaa	well go on a second date and third date and follow your instinct,you never can really tell if a guy likes you or not cos we all are actors in different ways.  goodluck|`|61Fwbi79aa	The first month or so, you are really not dating that person. Ypu are dating their PR person. They are putting their best image out there. Give it some time|`|NLxcfGplaa	Take things slow and see how he acts with you, while with other girls in front of you, see if he seems serious about you or if he acts flirty with other girls too.|`|AA10791200	dirty old man.|`|B9dluSbpaa	how old are you..? he's definitely into you    THAT DIRTY OLD FART|`|Fe2sw7rjaa	ask him to wear panties 24/7 that way he wont cheat when hes away and you will know hes yours.|`|nJSVwAxMaa	he wuldnt do any of the **** he did if he wasnt thinkin bout gettin serioush|`|J7Tw6Tcraa	Nah!|`|NxXnHwnhaa	HE BETTER BE SINCERE THAT OLD GUYS SHOULD NOT BE PLAYIN|`|sxqUt49xaa	Sounds serious. A guy that wants to play you wouldn't take you to a party with all his friends just so they can meet you once...|`|UT9doii0aa	Don't do it, you don't want a controlling figure in your life. Unless you want to be a housewife then I guess you could consider a serious relationship with him. Otherwise I would tell ya to keep lookin.|`|rqNb6FIraa	Any man that says he's looking for a long term relationship means it and he thinks you could be the one to share it with. He likes you and he sees the relationship going somewhere! And it sounds like you two have really hit it off so it probably will go somehwere. :)
6SxVuHjNaa	well tell ur Friend and if she says yes check her reaction if she looks weird or sad or nervous don`t but if she looks normal then go for it|`|t7XnGkSOaa	just talk to her about it.  let her know that if she doesn't want you to like him, you will back off.  she is your bff, you should be able to talk to her.  let her know that he acts like you like him, and you can't help but to like him too.  once you have her permission you will feel a lot better.  but generally speaking, I think it is fine for you to like her ex from the situation you described.|`|QgCqvtTQaa	clear it up with her....ask her if she has any feelings left for him and if not then tell her you like him and then go for it but make sure she has NO feelings for him.|`|2hhGgKBZaa	Now this is a bit tricky!    It is fine for you to like her ex. What you need to find out is how she feels about him. Is there any chance of them getting back together? Or is she completely over it?     Discuss it with your friend if you really really like him and if she's a good friend she should try and see from your point of view and understand. It's a hard pill to swallow, but that is what being an adult is all about. Despite her not working out with him she should wish you luck if you two work out!|`|2afVnStxaa	If he has been an ex for a year and she has moved on he is fair game, but she may still get a bit incensed at it though so beware. Also you may want to check out the reason she broke up with him, he may not be that great of a guy, so check into this before you jump in the deep end and find it out the hard way. Good luck to you.
BwDyOv7waa	It happens once in a while.  It will pass.  Do not worry.
ohi0kM6Raa	damnit, hard to get has been taken way, WAY outta context.  the right way to be "hard to get" means giving chase.  i will go into more detail.    hard to get:  i'd put some effort into you but if you just end up shunning me in your idea of "hard to get" i'll give up.  quickly.    giving chase:  i can tell this girl is interested, but how interested?  i would have to stay on my toes so i don't screw it up.      you can't give it up too easily (and i'm not talkin just about booty).  to make a guy really interested in you, you show him you like him but it's on uneven ground - meaning that it could go away if you wanted it to|`|2mlHf7Opaa	If she plays hard to get, I'll move on to someone who's not playing games.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	I am a girl, but I think the preference depends on the guy. Personally, I play hard to get.|`|6SxVuHjNaa	playing hard to get and if that doesn't work just tell him u like him and don`t be afraid trust me i`m a dude don`t worry|`|FdK1POvmaa	well if you are looking for a good relationship then hard but ot to hard to get is usually the key. Try not to come off smug or stuck up that  is a major turn  for most guys. But if you are not serious or looking for a serious relationship then don't play hard to get.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Playing hard to get is a little game... Men don't want to play games with relationships, additionally, a woman knows what she wants so don't deny it. A lot of mature woman are honest about their feelings and dont post a front. :) Just be honest with him and yourself.|`|LyR6DudNaa	I like it when girls do a little bit of both, because you show him that your interested and not a doormat he can walk all over. Hope that Helped!|`|saoLpaDPaa	i hate it when girls play hard to get.. it makes me just move on|`|HPftG1EOaa	it depends on the guy and how hard you are playing. if you make it clear you like him then a lil hard to get is ok. but being hot and cold to the guy wont work.|`|dvcBbL9laa	There's a strict balance; a fine line between the incredibly frustrating and the embarrassing gratefulness. I like something in between. As does everyone. I know.|`|IktPKRwRaa	guys are really simple creatures and they like things to be simple.  If you like a guy just let him know now.  I'm not saying guys aren't willing to work to get a girl they like, but if they have to work to hard a lot of the time they will just give up, I know I would.
RyApVLzQaa	Yeah just send her a message it wont hurt to try and see what she says back and to see if she re-adds you.|`|ShaUAySvaa	uhm yeah pretty much... :]gl|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	no, i will not answer|`|0OsqCShHaa	i think that u should tell her who u r..=] sorry i'm not specific...
6blfbeTGaa	Okay I'm a straight girl but it sounds like this girl is having pressure or feels the need to be straight-But I think she secretly likes you but she just can't say anything or she's too confused.  Or you could just be imagining this b/c you like her. If you didn't like her, wouldn't this just be normal straight girl behavior? When best friends are talking they will touch eachother (not sexually just you know..like "OMg i love your hair! " and touch it) but if she's telling you secrest and you are alone and she leans in then I think that's weird. Couldn't she just say it out loud? I think she may have feelings for you but she is Christian and Christainity does not accept bisexuality.  I would talk to her about how she feels and tell her how you are confused about how she's been acting. Maybe she will confess-Do not force her to say anything though let her say something when she's ready.|`|CuMEL4gEaa	I think she is straight but knows your not and kinda teasing by coming on to you so closely  she may be Bi curious i think you should wait to tell her how you feel as least till you graduate before u tell her  and Let me tell you something Time heals all wounds|`|YHcyuka3aa	It all depends on the age group your in. I had very close girlfriends growing up. I spent the night with them and slept in the same bed. We always would hug each other but no one ever made me feel they were 'in love' with me not did I feel that 'kind' of attraction for them. It could be that you are just her favorite friend and she knows she doesn't have to be any certain way with you. Don't encourage your feelings for her and when you think she is getting too close to you physically, tell her not to do that. Don't do something in your young years you will regret later on in life.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	So you want to know if she's the L word? :P  That's what you want to know.  Hmm, if she knows that you're Bi then maybe she gets the feeling that you do like her in that kind of way.  The flirty touches might just be flirty playful touches like she's teasing you.  She hugs her other friends not you?  Maybe you're right about her turning you on but you can't be sure about her liking you.  Since you've been best of friends, you should just be honest and open up.  Ask her if she feels something different about your relationship.  Tell her not to make you feel like she's leading you on.|`|hbanGS3Qaa	u have to weigh the options  how much do u value her friendship  and if it matters to you if you loose her as a friend  and are u willing to risk knowing her and your friendship  here is what can happen.  u make a move on her and she freaks out and says she never wants to see you or talk to u ever again .  and that would be the end of it.  the reason y she doesnt  give u hugs is because you are gonna be thinking about how good her boobs gonna feel on your chest and you gonna start thinking about them.  so if you want to gamble it and risk loosing it then go for it.  but if you rather not  then dont   since she knows how u feel about her then let her make the move. you may want to drop more hints but that will get old and she may be like girl drop it already  she may get sick and tired of you droping hints and she may back away.  GOOD LUCK|`|AA10791200	be patient, she'll eventually come out of the closet if she has leasbian tendencies. Good luck!!!!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Well you've already told her how you feel.It seems to me that even if she gets close to you she wants to remain friends.Maybe the reason she hugs her other friends is because if she hugs you, You might get the wrong idea about her feelings towards you.Keep it at friend level.|`|3BrOSZujaa	First of all bieng bi is gross. second who cares ask her not strangers. GROSS. not judging though. I'm just a cheerleader not used to bi just gay.|`|MtlkMecnaa	just talk to her about everything that you told us.|`|XjEMhJ0Raa	.... thats kinda weird. I really dont know what to say, and wouldnt know even if i did read the whole thing.|`|BbjELH60aa	I had a crush on my best friend for the longest time too, and she was always like i'm straight and blah, and she always went out with guys, but one day i just kissed her, and we were together for 3 weeks, but, it ended, and she got bi-curious, and now she's just bi.  I think you should talk to her, and maybe just give her a kiss on the cheek and see how she reacts or ask for a hug.   But if anything, just talk to her.|`|AA11707172	If you're really close BF's, then you should believe her when she says she's straight.  Why would she lie to you?|`|snbMl6kfaa	Im sorry but youre fooling yourself. Shes straight. most girls are like that if theyre best friends. I think she just wants you as a friend. nothing more.|`|c785d63ad03bd6785cbde800e0802c7daa	The best thing to do is ask a straight and forward question and tell her you expect a straight and forward answer. This way, you will know without any doubt if she likes and is interested in you as you are in her. Respect her response for whatever it may be and move on with your lives. True Friends are forever.|`|rqNb6FIraa	The touching and close whispering is all normal for girls. We get close and personal! If she says she's straight but gets hateful about your boyfriends it's just because she's never had one and is jealouse of you. And the whole hug thing is just her not feeling comfortable with that much touching with a lesbian. It's normal girl behavior but i can see how easily it can be missinterpretted.
AFNgR9jTaa	ask her out
b297669a7b7958048f4b9112d9395439aa	That's the problem with girls. A lot of them let their emotions get in the way and somehow they always grow hope that the relationship will get better.|`|U3W2AvnKaa	cause a lot of girls might think they're boyfriends going threw alot and theyusuallyy think they can help him get threw it i always liked to help my bf get threw anything it made me feel important to him|`|YvZKd1ycaa	idk, cuz i sure as hell don't|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Because love conquers all :]|`|OWw3LWDCaa	maybe because they see something inner in you that keeps them with you, not because they think they can change you.  ive given my partner a few chances as he has hurt me badly - not physically. he lied to me about the whole of his life, i know he is still telling some lies but have caught him and had it out with him.  we stay because of our love for our man. i could never understand how  or why a woman would stay in an abusive relationship - physcially or mentally or financially but now i do understand.  it is hard to walk away from someone you really love. im in my late 40's.  and yes i am carrying some scars on the inside because of his lies. but  i love this man deeply.  i hope this helps you.|`|4GJmZSKAaa	i don't put up with any crap|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Because they always think they can chance their boyfriend to become a "better man".|`|32WSjLpkaa	My boyfriend does stupid things too but I love him and I'm in love with him and I certainly didn't wait around for 1 and a half years for him to ask me out for nothing|`|30nzrpnCaa	she probably hasn't been able to find better. that's the only reason i'm with my boyfriend now, because he's awful, but i don't want to be alone and not get laid.    :) don't get your self esteem up too much,|`|6PcbjOdFaa	women love to be treated badly it's their nature ever since the stone age men would beat them with elephant tusks and antelope antlers|`|1APzAMmkaa	Their giving you another chance because they believen you.. maybe stop doing some messed up things and you wont have any more exes .. if your with a girl you really love then change for the better, for yourself aswell, not just her.. if you dont love her, then you shouldnt be with her.. its wasting your time and her time.. and she might be more serious then you are
FFlGzrROaa	ask to sit down and talk abuot it if it bothers you that much. truth is, that there are a great many peoplewho have gone through similar experiences and never talk abut it. he is lucky to be with somone like you who can open up, express and because of this have probably dealt with it. you are lucky to e with someone you trust enough to tell!   you're not stupid for telling him. it will help him later to understand about some of your little idiosyncracies. which of course everbody has some!   never feel stupid for opening up and sharing your truth. you never know when it may actually be helping soneone else. maybe even him or someone in his family.   but yes, it would be a good idea to let him know that for you, the fact that you have faced the inner demon and worked through it, and shared your story with him, means tat you can in fact enjoy a more fulfilling and open relationship together. he doesnt have to say sorry about sex with you - just enjoy the love you share with sex.|`|ohi0kM6Raa	well i mean, and this isn't to belittle you, but you still are a kid (i'm 24 and i'm still a kid).  so you might wanna wait til you got some more experience under your belt before laying this type of information on a dude.      other than that, if you have come to terms with it.  sit him down and tell him that you got over it and he doesn't have to dance the mine field around the topic of sex.|`|g5GKcf7daa	I understand. I told my boyfriend about a similiar occurence and for a while he was afraid to touch me or mention anything afraid he's stir up an old memory. Just reassure him that you are okay  with what yall are doing (if you are okay with it, of course) and the past is the past. You're not stupid for telling him. Obviously he trust him enough to tell him.|`|AA10289302	i think it was a good idea to tell your bf,about what happen to you when you were younger,but you can"t go around telling every guy you meet ,about it.You are 17 you are not Even sure that this guy will be around in a couple of months.these info are for people who you can trust someone who will com it himself to you ,who will love you for who you are ,if you think that he is the one then its fine ,if he can deal with it,only time will tell ,good luck with your guy,hugs.|`|sTqfKpbraa	its okay just tell him that you are okay now|`|McB2GTzDaa	nooooo   hes probably glad you were open  he just doesnt know your comfortable trust me   the same hing happened with my gf  he doesnt know what you went through and hes just trying to make sure he doesnt hurt you  make sure you let him know that its okay with you and your over it|`|ze9WgobOaa	no it wasn't dumb for you to tell him. hes just not sure how to react to the news. he doesn't want to upset you. explain to him that its okay to talk about sex, as long as it really doesn't bother you.|`|9HtY062Kaa	well, he just doesn't understand. you have to explain to him that it doesn't bother you like that.     -he's just a little ignorant... which is not a bad thing, just let him know how you feel.|`|N9WzNLsRaa	Well, tell him that you won't start getting emotional every time you two are talking about sex. He doesn't know how or if it still affects you. Be happy though that he's considerate of your feelings.
AA11876384	Be kind.  Whatever it is, just treat her with smile.     Sometimes smiles & silent are the best solution to solve many problems. So...be silent and smile.    All the Best|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Ignore her and avoid her, she is going through a phase and the less attention you give her the better.
IG4A4nuDaa	you HAVE to talk to him, or it will get worse and worse until he feels horrible and then YOU WILL BE A *****. Talk to him, make him feel like its your fault   (but its not)
XMH9RTRxaa	Well, to start off, he is probably just feeling a bit jealous.  If you ant to be with the ex, then just meet him, face to face, and explain the situation.  Tell him that you think about him a lot, apologize for dating his cousin..especially if you dated his cousin RIGHT after the break-up...just basically spill your heart out.  Crying helps a lot in these situations..but dont fake/force crying.|`|ofJOcZc1aa	You should LEAVE him alone.|`|UyULJUx1aa	Your ex is an EX. He had no right to be mad at you in the first place. You guys were over and you can date anyone you like! Forget him and go with his cousin.|`|6423d3e0eb9573a0ed7650b706c1f257aa	If I were you, I would just tell him how you feel face to face. Texting isn't a good option. If you care about him as much as you say you do, he should realize it, and if he doesn't, then he's not worth it.|`|iQegVOmnaa	honestly just move on, its never good to redate someone, the same things that happened before, will happen again. People dont change. Just wait for someone else, trust me he will come. If you dont n try to stay in this its gonna get bad.|`|nm9HTpBgaa	awwww... thats sucks!!!!! if you love him fight his heart back!  ask for forgiveness... & tell his cousin lets be the best of friends.
O1lm79EFaa	well, it's tough of course... but I believe anything is possible.. and with love there are no impossibilities.  if you really feel strongly about her and you honestly want it to work. Give it your all. What do you have to lose? Get a web cam mic etc etc it'll make the time apart easier..  Make sure you take trips to see each other if you can.. you'll at least have something to look forward too which will you keep you both hopeful    the best of luck
op4gBJRJaa	Simple answer, Sex is extremely pleasing and feels extremely good    Girls for the first few times may hurt, but it feels very good for them, which is why they make orgasms.    Guys just feels really good as well as you think to your self "Oh god i'm so lucky" which makes it feel even better|`|jaYg9MGKaa	It feels awesome for guys... no two ways about it.    For girls, it may hurt the first time, and perhaps even the next few times, but it varies from person to person and ends up feeling amazing after a short while.    Strap your ****.|`|WQpv3waOaa	well, i can't explain how it feels for males, but for females,     the first time is almost NEVER pleasurable. it's a painful expierence seeing as how penetration tears the hymen, and there's a likely chance that she'll bleed the next day or too. the first two or three times are generally semi-painful, but after that.. it starts to feel amazing, and if she enjoys it, she'll want it often.     just make sure you use protection.|`|WvMU36kwaa	I'm not sure what sex feels like myself, as I am still a virgin, but my best friend has had sex and says that it feels a bit like masturbation but warmer, wetter and tighter!
AA11313204	the fact that he avoided you, shows that you made a good choice. i think they do remember the ones who treated them with respect. i have been able to have friendly relationships with most of my ex's.|`|agR89OPtaa	Some do and some don't.  All I can say is sever all ties with him, if you are sure you don't want him in your life any more.  If you see him be cool toward him or ignore him altogether.  Don't give him a hint that you may want to get back together.  Never ever flirt with him again.  My ex wanted to be a friend with benefits after we divorced, I never let him get to first base.  We had a son together and if it concerned our son I would talk to him, otherwise I had nothing to say to him.  I found that was the best way for me.  And he pretty much left me alone.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It doesn't matter whether he remembers you one way or the other. Move on with your life and don't even give him a thought. If he's avoiding you there is no point in pursuit.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	I don't think so.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	i think we only remember the stalker ones so we can keep a watch out for cars coming down the sidewalk at us.     but I think the ones that simply walk away make us think that they were already done with the relationship.     i guess it would also depend on how they hurt you, like was it a simple break up or did he cheat on you, it makes a world of differnece.|`|bwygouP8aa	If you spend a part of your life with someone I don't know how you could not remember this person.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	From reading your last to nest question I think the rest of your question is a moot point. Stick to what you did in your last sentence.|`|JGGbQhCaaa	If you have decided that is time to get out of the relationship, do so in the most civil and mature manner you can. Why are you worried about whether or how he will remember you? You know what you gave and how you gave it. If it was with all your heart and not respected as you desired, what else could you do? Move on and don't let the baggage of that relationship weigh you down  --  if possible. Take the time you need to let that be the case. Leave him to stew in his memories in whatever way his character (or lack of same) dictates, as long as he's not harassing you. There will be brighter days ahead.  Peace.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	No I do not think that men appreciate women who "stand by their man " as you put it.They are not mature enough to value anything worthwhile. They cannot see the forest for the trees. Forget about him- believe me he does not give you a second thought. Good Luck|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If you allow them to hurt you and take it then they will keep it up. They will come to you when they have nothing better just to pass the time and when something better comes along they will move on.
qIDCTks1aa	take a shower and move around
KPXwwwMMaa	Sometimes an ear is one of the most helpful things in the world. People don't always want answers to their problems, they just want someone to listen and care.    Just think about all the personal stuff people unload on you. They wouldn't dare tell that stuff to someone who they didn't trust! They consider you a good friend, and therefore you are a good ear to hear them out.    If you need an ear every once in a while, then pull one of your friends to the side and say "hey, i'm going through a really tough time. can you get together to talk?" I'm guessing most of them would be happy to listen to you, too.
0PvpGjSqaa	maybe you should consider seeing a therapist. everyone needs to let their feelings out, but taking it on yourself isn't the best way to go about it. I graduated high school eight years ago and I have to say they were the absolute worst years of my life. I was very depressed, and I cut myself but I eventually found a therapist who gave me better ways to let my emotions out and I was on anti-depressants for a while. Anti-depressants aren't for everyone, but I know for me they helped alot. I still felt sad sometimes but it took the edge of so I didn't feel so hopeless. Do you feel comfortable talking to your parents about some of the stuff you are feeling? As hard as it may sound, you really need to find someone you trust to talk to. But if you can't start keeping a journal.|`|OWw3LWDCaa	can you go and to talk to your school counsellor??? you need someone to talk to and "vent' this all out. or go to your doctor and ask for some help.|`|H4f2dXVLaa	Chocolate is key.
igfQac8faa	i know what your going through.  cut him out of your life. its going to be awfully hard and you will cry a lot but it will be better in the end.  pull your friends and family closer! the best things are worth the wait. you will find someone one day who wont do stupid stuff like this to you!  good luck!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	just say NO.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	Find a new guy who will actually care more about you than just a random BOOTY CALL....    Simply dont take his phone calls, block him, delete him, whatever you gotta do.|`|snbMl6kfaa	if you want him in your life then talk to him but dont hook up with him. if he wants to then just say I dont want to hookup anymore im sorry but I really do wanna stay friends.|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	he is using u but u gootta go out in the world and search for guys thats the only way ull get over him... unless u dont want to get over him...|`|57dcd8c9cd435a421ee284618e113a81aa	Well I hope that you are using protection - when he gives you a disease maybe then you'll stop hooking up with him|`|91c6bKdwaa	okayyyyy, this happened to me as well. my ex moved to another town and when ever he came back he wanted to be with me and stuff. I stopped because i didn't want him using me and also because i found out he cheated on me when we were dating. I guess my getting over him was out of anger. but just think... by the way your story is, he is using you. I know you want to keep talking to him and stuff and for the friend thing, i would stop talking to him for a while and then see if you 2 can become friends. whenever i tried to just be friends with my ex, it always ended up being more. Also, now he knows he can always come back to you and that proves he is using you. Good luck!! :]|`|DKfScL8taa	He is totally using you, and the more you let yourself do this, the less he will think of you. You need to stop, it is hard, but you need to establish yourself and your dignity.|`|RvOH0hjhaa	think about what you would think of some other girl doing the same thing you are and how it makes them look...do u wanna be that girl?|`|xri2lFpKaa	the hormones get the best of you    u cant keep doing that he needs to be set aside from ur life    move on! @!@!! find a better guy that can treat u right and have a relationship with u without having meaningless sex!@!|`|gUqVgbCRaa	try to avoid him and when you see hes calling you dont answer ur phone or turn it off. if he asks whats up say u cant go on like this unless hes gonna be serious. u can do it!|`|vfj4kyGIaa	I'm going through the same thing but a little differently. Here's what I plan on doing tell him that you only want to be friends and nothing more. But say that you couldn't emagine your life without him but remind him of only a friendship!                Good Luck|`|a1PsKbkTaa	I have been through something similar with my ex. I got sick of him using me while he was talking to other girls. He was so cocky when he had no right to be. my advice is as hard as it seems quit cold turkey don't lower yourself to just hooking up with an ex you can do better than that. i don't think you can be just friends anymore it seems to go past that and you can never return but that'ss your call i hate all my ex's so i never wanted to be friends with them. it seems hard but just remember there are better guys than him out there|`|xZI6noJiaa	WOW. I just fixed this problem in my own life, so i get it all too well.    Here's what I did, and it really opened my eyes. If you get a chance just turn the tables. But it will really only work if he's in town more than one day. Take control of the hook up. The first time he calls- DON'T answer/reply. At all. The entire night. The next night- you booty call him. If he responds, well,you now run the show. If he doesn't, well it'll be a ***** of a reality check, but then you'll have a good reason to get him out of your life for good.|`|3rxzsxHTaa	Therapy|`|99VDPhdMaa	aw, hunny. im sorry. the same thing happend with me. i just asked him if he would like to go to the movies. and when he kept blowing me off unless i told him i wanted to have sex it started getting old and i deleted him from every thing . and i just got a new distraction. like another boy or sport.|`|PN87CADeaa	same experiance...    it took me a while to get over my ex , so i just ignored him and then i ended up feeling bad . so then i kind of took it slow with him and finally i slowly grew away , and now im over him and we are just friends , the way it should be .    goodluck [;

ecd8878664bcce3ec7187e61bf72ead8aa	He made an extremely adult decision, and is now acting immaturely.  The longer he waits, the harder it will be, and the longer his parents will be ticked off.  Perhaps, if he's really nervous, he can have his grandfather with him when he breaks the news.|`|AA10544661	he should tell them soon the sooner the better|`|AA11268939	it really would be better to tell them so that he doesn't surprise them later...that is only fair...even if they don't like it at first, they can have time to come to accept it.  Also, he owes them that after 17 years of care and that is just due respect.|`|IHqo9TP7aa	tell!|`|TcOf6lsxaa	Well, I'd say he should tell them because he will be gone and they are eventually going to realize it. They are parents they find out everything, so if they find out and he didn't tell them, they would probably be even more mad.
62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	some times you just need to stop and think well enough is really enough, dont let him drag you down as well   good luck hun|`|10oCEDMuaa	Yes, I agree with you. That is a hard situation and as much as you probably love him - you need to do what is best for your son and yourself. If you are feeling unsafe, you need to leave him. There are many shelters you can go to for help if you don't have anywhere else to stay.     It may take you leaving for him to realize what he has and what he is doing to himself. I think you need to leave him if the drinking is getting that bad. You can only help someone that wants to help themself. Always remember that.
wRwf1aGKaa	honestly man, im not sure what to say...if she sounded like she meant it, i guess its your choice on whether to deal with it or break up with her, if it sounded like she was just upset and said it because of what was going on, then id say just let her calm down, keep being there for her and maybe she'll eventually tell you whats wrong...it could possibly be that she's trying to push you away for some reason...good luck
5k7BexD3aa	He's just not that into you.|`|NOhfm4qdaa	I'm a little older then him. I'm 43 and full time parent. A big deal breaker with me is young kids. It's not that I don't like young children. It's just my daughter is now 17 and I'm looking forward to the time in my life when I can be free on raising kids. I so look forward to not having to be accountable to a child. It's just me but I suspect there are others just like me out there. I would never consider serious dating anyone with a kid under 15 at this point in my life. Maybe it's not a cop out.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	I think he was just being straight forward. Be happy he didn't string you along, both reasons sound valid.   Remember, he was recently divorced and he was probably processing what he wanted and didn't want in his next relationship.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Well the age difference IS substantial.    He's probably looking for something different. Just accept that he thinks you aren't a good match and move on.     If he wants different things from you than you want from him....it's very respectful not to marry you with unfulfilled expectations.    Good Luck!|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	i think he had the experience of being a step father already and doesn't want that again. i think he was nice enough to break it to you early instead of after you were in a relationship.
dE9OmE71aa	I have...no idea what a candy bar poem is, but i'll assume it's a poem about a candy bar.       One Payday, Mr. Goodbar wanted a Bit-a-Honey,  So he took his Miss Hershey behind the Powerhouse on the corner of 5th Avenue and Clark,   Where he then began to feel her Mounds.   And that was an Almond Joy which definitely made his Tootsie Roll.   He let out a Snicker as he slipped his Butterfinger up her KitKat,   Which of course caused the Milky Way.   She screamed,"Oh Henry!", as she squeezed his Peter Paul and Zagnuts,   And she said, "You're better than the Three Musketeers!"      Pervy, I know, but hilarious isn't it?
y4SUDnpaaa	Yes, your doctor told you how long it should be before you made love again. Most men who thought about it for one second would know why that was the doctor's advice and took it. What part of that did you not understand ? Now you know for yourself the reason for waiting. Give your wife one of your pain pills, selfish.|`|4arnbpUCaa	This has to be a bogus question.  A circumcision takes a month to heal, not a day.  Don't have any more sex, and call the doctor for advice on how to care for the wound.|`|mAIfKiUgaa	For the time being, I don't see any real good answers.  A condom may and lots of lube help your wife but I doubt you'll have much enjoyment until the stitches come out and the tenderness subsides.  Mildred is my leader.|`|AA10772811	just wait my gosh!|`|K4zsztkRaa	If you still have the stitches in your shouldn't be having sex.  That's common sense.    You can tear your suture line and get a serious infection.    You and your wife need to develope some common sense.    No sex for 4-6 weeks untill it's 100% healed. And absolutly no sex without a condom for 3 months after the operation. You still have to protect the new scar tissue, it will tear very easily. Condoms for 3 months.  You don't listen to your doctor very well do you?    -Connor|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Indeed it is painful become you are still wounded. Common sense dictates that you let it heal first or else it is very susceptible to infection and it may lead to other complications for you and your wife. Don't depend too much on pain med, they only dull your senses but don't cure the wound.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Can't you just wait a week or so?|`|gb9ERmHPaa	wait til you get the stitches out, give eachother oral pleasure until then.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Dude wait it out!|`|fzIeGPZYaa	LOLL ya might want to wait awhile dude, sorry|`|vSJIorF7aa	Honestly. Heal up for a couple of weeks. Pleasure eachother other ways.

Instead of getting circumcised you should have gotten a vasectomy.  If you are so ignorant to be trying to have sex a DAY after surgery, you have NO common sense and shouldn't breed.  Did you even LISTEN to the doctor?|`|AA11737190	You definitely need to wait.    Why did you decide to get circumcised?    The wife isn't so lucky! Truer words were never written.
XKtjEiEraa	I think you answered your own question, so reread it. This guy is abusive and psycho; just count your blessings that he is in another country and cut all ties. Distributing a picture of him naked to friends and family will only make him angry.|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Hahahahhahaah i know its not right, but revenge is sweet....if u do, send it anonymously. My boyfriend hurt me as well. Do what you feel is right. I would do it.I know, im bad XD|`|2lDQktYjaa	I wouldn't do that, because I wouldn't like it to be done to me. I think it's kind of low, plus nobody wants to see him naked, I'm kind of sure about that. I wouldn't like someone to give me a naked picture of a guy that I know, it's just gross. I am for revenge, but there must be another way. Good luck
ZlC654Dkaa	I think you should talk to your boss before you hand in your resignation.  Tell your boss you're thinking of resigning, and why.  Talk about why work sucks.  Then if things don't improve, hand in your resignation, clearly stating why you're leaving.  Ok then, you've run out of options, then just hand it in.  If she can't handle it, it's not your problem, but she can beg you to come back.
3yoiglPBaa	Sounds like someone found their soulmate.    And I think you'd have a lot of experience to judge it by.

AA10075228	I agree with you completely and I feel really badly for the children themselves, who will never be able to have quality time with their Mother, nor will they have the care that they deserve as individuals.  This woman is out after all the free money she can get, and it should be against the law to inseminate a woman that does not have a husband, and who is obviously out to gain all the money and publicity that this tragic event brings.  I wish the best for the children, who will need all of their lives to find a family that will think them special for just themselves.  How very sad this world has become.|`|M4L3QY3gaa	I think the media just wanted a story, and are perpetuating the story for the publicity. They want a SCANDAL, nothing more, nothing less.

1Q5XZgoiaa	i've never heard of any guy starting to thin out on the sides. maybe that's just the way your hair is. if there's clumps of hair in the shower drain, then there is cause for concern. use rogaine or start getting a different haircut.|`|UiQ6V377aa	"bald"    please go to an English class ASAP|`|vfj4kyGIaa	you want to go with shaved head but not too much, you'll look weird. just enough where you can see the hair. and keep it sexy. lol

fd5FdvZ7aa	first off you'll never make friends if you cut your self down so much people now days have enough drama of there own and don't want a friend that they have to hear " o im so ugly " and stuff like that I mean its not right they should help you through it but if people don't like you for how you look than that tells you right there that they are not worth your time truth friends don't care and you just have to have faith and believe in your self|`|AA11876384	One sure thing in your mind is, i guess you are having so much inferiority complex.     Be relax, and think what are the +ive things you are having.  Better be think like this, you makes the world beauty, without black no one sees to be beauty.    YOu must be happy to make others beautiful.    Try to feel better by talking with your good friends, if you ve no friends till now, just analyse the people talking with you and i am very sure you must see some people who match with your character.    ALl the best|`|gUUtGcbBaa	i think that your not ugly noone is ugly everyone is a different person and special in they're own way you have to learn on how you can charm pple with being yourself at the same time and also take care of your image you dont have to be good looking but you need to be clean and wear close that is gonna make you feel comfortable read positive books that boost your self steem up . Look inside you listen to the person that is really inside you, you know who you are best and how you feel in every situation learn how to control that and make it benefit you at all times, try to be the best you the whole time.and also have a lof of hope and faith in you...because life is out there waiting for you, waiting to offer you a life that you deserve because you are a person, and a great person ;)|`|aexekiU9aa	Hey,you can email me and we can be friends together. Just share everything with me..    m1_26jessica@yahoo.com|`|kmLKKGGyaa	try boosting your self confidence. be active it always makes you feel rejuvenated. dress how you want to dress, fix up your hair, and get social. don't go to the point where you feel bad about yourself and uncomfortable. work from the inside out. start up conversations. you wont get anywhere with low self esteem. not a lot of people are superficial and only want hot friends many just want someone who feels great about themselves. think your beautiful and people will see that, think confident and people will notice you. 1. get active 2. gain self confidence-join social groups, think beautiful and confident, and not awkward! 3. socialize!!! get friends that love you. you'll feel so much better!  good luck :))
FROfw46Yaa	That's always a possibility, but I wouldn't say she was. At least not intentionally. If I were in her place and said that to the guy I like, I would mean it to an extent. If she really cares about you, then she'll want you to be happy. She doesn't want to feel like she's the one making you unhappy, At the same time, though, she does like you and wants to be with you, so she's hoping you continue to wait for her. If you don't, she'll be sad, possibly angry (depending on how she deals with sadness/disappointment).     I'm not quite sure if that made sense, but I did my best to explain it. You just have to stop and really ask yourself if she's worth the wait. If she is, great. If she's not, then you just have to prepare yourself for how she's going to react. But I wouldn't base your decision on whether or not she's testing you. Like I said, she might be, but if she is, I really don't think it's a conscious decision. And if she is, then she's probably going to test you on other things in the future, and you'll probably find that out eventually and can decide what to do then. Until that point, I'd give her the benefit of the doubt.

53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|HDEbDPp3aa	go and propose him or it'll be too late|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Casually ask him if he has a gf.He'll know what your driving at.He'll query why and just let him know your beginning to see him in a different light.Also be careful to add but you'd do nothing to jeopodise the friendship
21ecc2cfc6168a3be68b36ee0f27984eaa	the fact that you are such a good analyzer, and understand situations show that you are mature. a guy who appreciates you will not even notice nor compare your cousin! and believe me you shouldn't be jealous of her because her bad rep will surely affect her life in the future. stick to your morals and realize that there are many more factors than looks and boys, maturity, education and personality play a huge role! I am sure you are a great girl, dont compare yourself to her, one day when she wants to settle down, she may realize that her boy playing days could affect her relationship!|`|l9uGrfSYaa	You should be proud of who you are! I mean, sure you feel next to nothing against your cousing, but think of what YOU have to live for and what she has to deal with now that she uses her beauty so umm...loosely (I don't mean to insult your cousin......sorry).     If you were like her, how do you think your life would be? It would be completely different! You wouldn't be like you are now......thought wise, you'd probably be hanging out with a group of friends, and lastly, you would use your beauty to get out of trouble....and getting out is the where the bad mistakes begin.     Don't take yourself for grantide. Be thankful of the life you have now and build a future on that sturdy ground. Your cousin might be beautiful, but her life foundation is crumbling with every mistake she makes.     hope that helped a bit.     nya bya|`|cMrxyWQ0aa	Ugh, you shouldn't be jealous.  What a skank.|`|5uUSJNSLaa	just stop hanging out with her.     so what if she gets the guys? i mean, its not permanent. the guys fall for her cuz shes pretty, but if her bad rep with guys spread around, i doubt guys will still like her. she's basically a whore, no offense, just stating my opinion.    you have nothing to worry about

The age difference doesnt matter, just be happy.|`|EZ6RCjAqaa	Okay, i'm 15 and i have been used by guys that are older. Start by just hanging out with him. DO NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF SEX WITH HIM. I mean it might be fun and stuff but you don't need any kids or diseases. And if you are gonna have sex you need rubbers and birth control. First just get to know him, and wait for sex and **** cause thats what the older ones like. Just be you, be patient, and if things are supposed to happen with you two then they will.|`|kG3AfXvsaa	Well the great news is if he isn't very experienced.. you don't have to worry about impressing him as much. Just be yourself, and give him a break. As in, don't give him the feeling that you may be more experienced then him. And no its not abnormal to want to date an older guy. My ex turned 16 in october and he is 1 1/2 years older than me. He was more mature, and wasn't that experienced either especially when it came to making out haha. But anyways, I am 14, will be 15 in may, he broke my heart, and i still miss him. But things could go differently for you. Hope that helped.
STI2L7ojaa	I think you did the right thing here. You're responsibility is to do what's best for your friend, and not what some random boy would want. As long as your friend gave approval of what you've done, I don't see the harm in it. The guy will move on and forget soon enough.|`|HGMCvkc9aa	if they were in love then no, you did a terrible thing by ending their relationship for sure.. a lot of people go against what their parents say for love.    but if it was just a crush, then more power to you. i'm glad you're helping your friend to move on with her life.     hope i helped. :)|`|h3bCojeuaa	In india parents r always against inter-religion marriage,and it is always safer to have an arranged marriage and respect the parents decision.

AA11457042	why do you feel like you have to prove anything? If you're secure in your relationship you don't have to prove your feelings for him. Just enjoy each others company.

AA10757358	Everyone is an individual.  If we all did the same things, talked about the same things, all had the same quirks, and all needed to go to the physiologist about the same thing and every body hated you or every body liked you and every one thought the same way what a dull life this would be.  So your mother is different than you are.  If you don't like the way she acts, just ignore her go to your room and close the door and let her rant and rave alone.  Soon she may get tired of rating and raving alone and quit doing it.  Then to maybe she is doing it because she has nothing else to talk about.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I fully sympathize with you. I can understand your position. I had similar experience in my life that is why I can know your mental condition. I am still a sufferer. Somehow I manage the time and life by the simple grace of God alone. Besides my prayer, I (we) have also consulted a psychiatrist and as per Doctor's advice, medicine is given.  No one can understand without personal experience of such situations.  All my relatives are not able to clearly realize my difficulty. And nobody comes forward to help me. It is a pity. Because I cannot blame any one of them. All are tied up with their own priorities.    You too can pray. But don't leave with prayer, take her to a psychiatrist. She is either having some schizophrenia attack or some such thing to do with her brain. It looks odd. Better to take professional advice and take preventive action and give her some medicine so that she is able to come out of this difficult.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Just love your mom, and maybe she will find something to do, to stay busy.|`|5LZ6ujMfaa	There are many things... maybe she just has to much time on her hands, I know my mom can be super weird sometimes!

And they trust each other. So ask yourself if you are your own best friend, true to yourself, honest with yourself, accept yourself without judgment? If you can truly say you honor yourself then you will honor yourself in your choice of girlfriends as well as other friends. If your "Friends" don't like your girlfriend and let that interfere with their friendship with you, that's their issue and may suggest they're not true friends. If they tell you you've changed, either they are willing to take you as you are or they want to make you over. Why deal with "friends" who want to tell you how to live your life? So continue to be honest with and true to yourself...and you will attract true friends who love you for the way you are, not the way they want you to be.|`|ca55342e3512dcc2533294bbded08fe4aa	your friends are mad that you have a girlfriend and they problem don't have a girlfriend..

7d3d6055f9dc6ecc99ef3bac91624614aa	kk, I'm a teen. First of all, the reason he doesn't respect you is because you don't discipline him. Also, myspace is junk, block it from your computer. You may want to visit his myspace in your freetime and find out who his "friends" are so that you can see what he's really up to. For the school thing, when he comes home, give him 30 min to get a snack or whatever he needs, then he needs to do his schoolwork. Check on him every few minutes to make sure he's doing his work. He'll probably hate your guts for a while, but when he's an adult, he'll be glad you kept him from doing all this stuff. Another thing, if you find out that he was being disrespectful in school, take away a privilage. Such as, concerts for exapmle. A ton of teenage boys love to go to concerts, so, if you tell him he can't go to one: it will be a real punishment. And he won't want it to happen again, so he won't do it again. (this will take a few times.) I really hope everything works out. By the way, I'm 15.|`|00ba14df888a1fbc98d0509d2fdf84a8aa	Do YOU have the ability to talk to him as a third person?  What you can do is sit him down and have him tell you what is wrong. No matter what it is. Be sure to take notes, I'm sure he's got a long one. Try not to make any "parent" comments. He will want a friend's point of view. If you can't do that, take your notes and post them here, you'll get lots of opinions that you can sort thru.  Therapy won't work. They usually only have one way to doing things and everyone is different. You have to back off of the parent role and take on more of a friend role with teens. Simply because ALL teens have the rebel streak. I know it's wierd but...a 'friend' can say the same thing as a 'parent' and the teen will only do it AFTER the friend's advice.|`|AA10264038	are you and your ex able to get together and talk with him if your son repects him maybe you can come up with a similar way of dealing with him|`|7745f9034cb76fcd7f0641cad7c408f1aa	You have to do the best for your son, even if it means sending him to his father.

Good luck.|`|a77a3cefacae154aba61a9508ce7121faa	I have friend in a similar problem. What happened is BOTH of them sat down their son and told him to get his act straight. When both of you have united front with your son he will no longer think he can run over you but not his Dad. If that doesn't work, then send him to his Dad's he is not gonig to resent you for trying to keep him on the right track and out of trouble.   Remember during those years we resent our parents for breathing. Anything else they do is simply icing. Do not be afraid of that. Keep doing your best for him and don't give. I think you can do it.|`|79ca99212b4a69bfc0732deaa5c72b2faa	Wow!!!  I know exactly where you are coming from.  My mother is at her wits end with my twin brothers.  They are 16 and are so disrespectful.  One of my brothers doesn't even go to school anymore because his attitude towards the teachers and other elders was so bad.  My mom has sent him to his dad's to stay, but he was back in the house a week later...not to mention that he still came over everyday to eat and take a shower while he was living with his dad.  He even steals from his friends and family.  He is also hanging with the wrong crowd.  Does your son have a girlfriend???  Ever since my brother got his new girlfriend his attitude seems to get worse by the day.  He treats my mother and I like crap.  He seems to treat the ones that care about him the most the worst.    I don't know if you have Job Corps where you live, but that is something that we are looking into.  It gives them a chance to get their diploma and get them started in the working world.  They train them for specific jobs...kinda like a trade or vocational school.  Last resort would be military school.  Hope everything gets better.  If you don't like the idea of sending him to these schools then you should either talk to him or go though therapy.  Good luck.|`|c4d984353c85c3f0163204d4bf29719faa	I think you should pretty much tell him the same thing.  That you love him more than anything, but you can't let him keep being disrespectful and unproductive.    Tell him that he has a choice.  He can do his homework, chores, and be respectful, or you he will be punished.  Punishment could be loss of privileges (computer), grounding, etc...  Tell him you are going to let his dad know about his behavior.    I would only send him to dad to live as a last resort.|`|ee29a0d1337fd5e6843403b5de826c75aa	he is just going through a phase where all teenagers think that there out of there childhood and they want to have fun so here's what you do on a weekday or weekend sit him down or when he's not busy say to him and ask him what or where do you wanna go then he'll reply back and if he says he wants to go to the mall or somewhere to his friends house drive him there you'll have more time to spend with him and and talk about what's going on then he'll just get use to that routine and he'll get use to you too.|`|c618d29a9aafe8b9a6d7320285bd1f26aa	therapy sucks kids hate it expetialy kids   have you ever (when tings are doing o.k)  just sat down and talked to him|`|e9ccacc16f919b40d9d98a7458a430bdaa	he's just trying to be cool, thats  1 priority for a teen. even though you want what's best for him he just doesn't see how this can really affect him. if you think having him stay with his dad is best then try that, but talk to him and let him know you aren't giving up, you just think he'll be happy there.

Creo que mientras uno tenga vida, pues hay que aferrarse a lo que tenemos, y creo que de seguro tinees una familia que te apoya y me imagino que tienen que estar preocupados por ti, porque no te das la oportunidad de convivir con ellos, y que ellos sean los que te ayuden a superarlo, creeme que a veces es necesario no cargar solitos con los probelmas y de vez en cuando, recargarnos (por decirlo asi) en el hombro de otra persona, eso nos ayuda a desahogarnos y nos permite darnos cuenta de que otras personas se preocupan por nosotros.  Creo que deberias de darte la oportunidad de que ahorita que estas triste acercarte a las personas que mas quieren, ellos mejor que nadie, te podran ayudar y vas a ver que lo vas a superar con el apoyo de ellos, te lo digo por experiencia.

tVeVPTCAaa	Sabes El Amor, cero que cuando lo sientes,  no sabes que en realidad estas sintiendo por que es un torbellino de emociones entre pasion, deseo, nervios, satisfaccion, entrega, transparencia.    Pero sobre todo felicidad. Te sientes que nada te falta, que todo esta bien lo raro es que no nos damos cuenta cuando lo descuidamos y no podemos dar marcha atraz.    Es el sentimiento mas lindo sobre la faz de la tierra y yo no creo que se ame solo una vez, yo creo que puedes amar tantas veces como tu estes dispuesto a entregar, si no lo vives al 100%, jamas vas a realmente a amar en plenitud, si sales lastimado  no pues eso ya es otra cosa, pero generalmente si te entregas al 100 obtendras la misma respeusta de tu pareja (no siempre, pero si la mayoria de las veces).    Lo que si es que en esta rueda de la fortuna de la vida lo que concluto es que eso del amor esta ca?on, y cuando estas arriba disfrutemoslo gocemoslo, y cuando nos toque abajo, afrontemoslo, y no nos dejems caer en la depresion.     Al final es la sal y pimienta que le pone sabor a nuestras vidas y nos hace darnos cuenta que estamos vivios. y concluyo con una frase que le que es muy cierta, que dice que No se considera vivir midiendolo por cuantas veces respiramos, sino por aquellos momentos que nos quitan el aliento.    Suerte y a disfrutar que estamos aqui.|`|3187c7de0edcbe93fc763c548bcc74c3aa	El amor es sufrido, es benigno; el amor no tiene envidia, el amor no es jactancioso, no se envanece;  no hace nada indebido, no busca lo suyo, no se irrita, no guarda rencor; no se goza de la injusticia, mas se goza de la verdad.  Todo lo sufre, todo lo cree, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta.   El amor nunca deja de ser.   1a.

If you still want to date and have an active single life you need to make immediate arrangements to put your baby up for adoption when it's born.  There are so many married couples in their 30's and 40's that desperately want to be parents and have all the resources to do so.  When your baby is born your needs come LAST.  That's right.  And, don't be bringing looser men around while you try to snag one.  If you insist on keeping this baby you will need to concentrate on protecting him/her and providing for them yourself.  If you can't or won't do it then please put the baby up for adoption.|`|ce17072ac899bcf563e793dfb710e954aa	LET THIS ONE GO COULD BE A PETIFILE|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I think you said you were pregnant, why are you out looking for any man right now.

If he loves you and appreciates you, he'll show it.  He will respect you and your time and not "change his mind at the last minute."  He'll show he cares by the things he does and back it by the things he says.    That would show appreciation to me.

We met when i was about 16 (im now 20),in  a really weird way, basically i thought she was some one els and went to beat her up (I no, I no, but i was young!) When realizing it wasnt her i walked away and carried on with my day. The next day i see her in a park i was sitting in with my mates and Saf wasbabysitting her cousin,she knew a boy i was sitting with and came and sat down she asked if she could have a cigerette and i just gave her 1 and still we hadnt spoken. About an hour later i see a boy about 17 yrs old shouting at Safs cousin she was babysitting who was 6!! And i went mad and stuck up for the 6yr old and Saf, then my mates sorta turned against me because they didnt like Safs, and didnt understand why i had just stuck up for them, then that day we started talking and since then we have basically been joint at the hip! Weve been through everything together both lived in a hostel together, been homeless together, been through experiences with boys together.. EVERYTHING, we can tell each other everthing and were really comfortable with each other with everything ,and we never judge each other. Every one we meet never knows us as Brandii,(Me) or just Safs, Its always been "Brandii and Safs"... and if one of us isnt with the other people think its strange everyday were together or talk on the phone for hours!!

I got into some deal of change in a couple of years, setting my friendships afar. I was shy and kept back when around friends, adaptable yes, but wasn't happy, when I got online a couple of years ago, I end'd up shy to begin w/ then I became more out going to people, still adaptable but out there. more happy. friendships w/ face to face people ended up w/ no contace, loseing numbers and they just replay in my mind on what kind of friends they were? I still don't know. most I do know made me feel like I was there just to take up space and that's it. eehhhh|`|AA10196080	i got lots of friends and most of them are good friends. It would really be better if you have friends around because they help you a lot whenever you have problems, they listen, they care, they help and they understand you. In school, they help you in your studies by sharing their ideas and helping them also what they need to know. If you are already working, Friends help you get out the boredom but again it would depend also on their attitude.  a good relationship with your friends depend on each attitudes.  If you have anything you don't like to a friend , both of you won't work. so the relationship depends on each attitude.

aa679c6ce84a2ca860911237a432449aaa	It does not sound as if you and this Asian are in a serious relationship, still a friendship kind of level. Just because you and him danced and he seemed happy about does not mean he will feel that same way. There may be more to the situation then meets the eye. He may not be over his ex but won't tell you because he is afraid, or not sure your reaction. Maybe you need to ask him if he is over his ex and wanting to hang out with you more, if he can't give you and answer and gives you that I am not sure look it may be he is not sure what he wants to do and might need sometime then ask him again of course after sometime has passed and if he is still not ready then you need to move on. I am sure you really like him but don't be in a hurry to rush into anything serious especially if he is not ready, you and him can still be friends if that is what you are. That way you can know him more. You are still young yet and decipher what you are ready for and what you can handle, and what you want to do and how to get it.

A man searches after a woman, and a woman searches after a man, and when they unite for sex the material illusion becomes very strong. This is nature's arrangement for keeping the conditioned soul under her stringent laws.    The whole material world is based on the attraction between male and female. This principle is working not only in human society, but among the birds, beasts, aquatics, insects- everywhere. You will find that as soon as a male dog sees a female dog, the male immediately begins canvassing: "Please come, let us unite."     Therefore, in human society one has to understand by Vedic knowledge, by education, that we are bound up within this material world due to sex attraction. Unless one inquires into the Absolute Truth, a human being is no better than an animal.    Questions?

If you are developing feelings for him, tell him that you would like to start dating.  Not just come over and have sex. He may object.  Actually, he *will* object, unless he also has feelings for you.  You may have to choose between continuing to just have sex with him or ending the entire affair.  I do not recommend the first option, since your attachment will only grow the more you sleep with him, and eventually you are going to be a wreck.    And who knows... maybe after a few dates you'll discover that you don't like him that much after all.  Other than the sex, of course.|`|AA10241642	talk to him about it.|`|ZuzSUymFaa	If you are friends with benefits and he is getting the milk for free, he is not going to consider buying the cow (I'm not calling you a cow - just using a metaphor).  Guys who can get sex that easily and that often from someone do not have anything to motivate them to have a relationship because they are having the fun without having to work at a relationship.  Now, if you were to stop having sex with this guy and focus on the friendship, and tell him that you have decided that you have too much self-respect to have sex with someone who doesn't want a relationship with you, then see if he tries to pursue an exclusive romantic relationship with you.  If he does, then don't give him sex for awhile.  Make him earn it.  If he thinks he can get you to believe in him for a few weeks and then he can get sex out of it, he might be able to do without for a short time.  If on the other hand, you stick to your guns, you will know if he truly cares about you as more than friends, because he will think you are worth waiting for.  If he has trouble waiting, then you will have your answer.  He only wants to have a friends with benefits relationship.  You deserve better than that.  We all do.|`|AA12262106	You have allowed him to get what he wants without giving any commitment. That is a very sweet deal for him, and I doubt that he is going to want to change that unless you threaten him with denial of benefits.   The old expression "why buy the cow if you get the milk for free" covers your situation.|`|W3sJxkIoaa	Tell him you love what he offers, but you need more, tellhim you'll screw him even more if he does other stuff like dates and real romance.

e080e29f7157008accda64fa2c52d883aa	Maybe it doesn't mean no.

If he doesn't like you, it isn't the end of the world!!! There's a ton of good guys out there who probably would like you!!!|`|6f1oi5KXaa	well the way I see it is that even though he doesn't have an answer to give to someone else doesn't mean he doesn't like you. he may feel like it's a little childish for your friends to be doing all the talking instead of you. it seems a bit 8Th grade to me. if you really like him talk to him in person and tell him how you feel. he already knows so what's it going to hurt? Then again if he really doesn't like you hay there are a lot of fish in the sea and when you do get another boy and he see's you with him, he'll be jealous|`|AA10067225	he's very flattered and happy that a cute girl like you likes him. That's why he acts like that.|`|89fa1fe261f4694d6f316f78821ae19baa	HE likes you but doesnt want you to know.

Move on, life is too beautiful to be spent on guys who just look and have no answers.|`|8c4c08c9c3a53f51824f38cefbcd7878aa	I don't think that just because he didn't have an answer that it necessarily means "no". If he's really all that shy or has never considered you before it might have surprised him. Maybe he figured YOU didn't like HIM. He might be watching you a lot more because he's trying to figure out if he likes you in that way.    I was in the same situation and the guy hadn't really looked at me that way before, but once he knew I liked him he wanted to look at me. It was embarassing :P|`|K8La9ovTaa	he totally likes you! he probably said he didnt have an answer beause he is shy and guys dont like admitting stuff like that out in the open..thats just how they are! does he have a myspace or facebook? totally start facebooking him and talking to him, and if you have enough guts start talking to him more face to face. what do you have to lose?     good luck :D|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	Let me guess you are really young. Hell just ask him What the Hell You Looking At!|`|AA11541285	Wow, that tough. Well all I can say is, maybe he may have regretted doing so, and looks at you everytime he has the chance, trying to make up his mind. Maybe he's already with someone? And he doesn't know what to do, it could happen to us. I mean think about it, what if you were stuck in a love triangle, what would you do?    If that's not the case then maybe he doesn't know what to do, all in all, someone has to make the first move, and I think it has to be you.

Their timing needs some adjusting, but its still better than fighting all the time like some parents do.  Most adults still have a busy bedroom life, they just keep it behind closed doors.  Say nothing about the last episode.  If it happens again, you could say, "Sure seems to be alot of action up there.  Can that wait until the movie is over?"|`|AA10673237	What's done is done.

While it wasn't right of them to do this in front of you, (if that's what they really did) they are married, and they have a right to do what they want with each other.

This way, it's an open forum and they'll both have to be honest with you, right there.

They aren't just disrespecting you, they're also disrespecting him. But as far as the relationship you share with him, if you're not getting what you want then you have your answer. You're with the wrong guy and you need to move on if he doesn't make a change.  The only other thing you have at your disposal is to resort to game playing, meaning trying to counter act his behavior with different behavior of your own.

Unfortuneatly, until Natalie feels more comfortable she will probably keep on laughing at odd things. Try to bare with her for a while and if you really can't stand it, you may have to confront her about it. This definetly isn't easy, but if it's bothering you that much, it's your only choice.

So that being the situation, they like a submissive wife who will take care of the husband's every need.|`|AA12133859	A vagina.|`|AA11031439	Attractiveness is always plus regardless of the race.  Depends on each individual's life style. Some would like girl with big chest or bust or skinny. I would say it would not make much different from non-korean men.

I mean if you're 12, no big deal, you got time. But if you're 20 & haven't been kissed, well maybe you are sending the wrong signals or the guys around you are immature & not ready yet.  I got my first real mouth to mouth kiss when I was 13 & I will never forget it, but not because it was earth shatttering, but because it was the 1st. But the 1st time my main squeeze kissed me was like in the movies. It took my breath away & I felt like swooning. Those are the kisses worth waiting for.

q3u36YDMaa	No--I completely agree. It seems that society has corrupted this generation, y'know? Even when I was in grammar school, kids weren't really into guys. In 5th grade we even had a *cootie* epidemic, in which all the girls ran around the centrium (not to mention class), claiming that guys were gross. Our tables were even voluntarily segregated by race and gender! Crazy, but still.    I am 17, and I stare in utter disbelief at the waves of little boys and girls shopping at Hollister, wearing skimpy outfits (girls), getting the whole surfer/skater look (guys). Not 7 years ago were 5th graders simply concerned with looking decent, yet it seems now that the media and, well, society, has reached them before their common sense had a chance to react. They see these celebrities and siblings who are just a few years older than them (in their teens) going out and doing god knows what, and they begin to mimic those actions, believing that if they get a boyfriend, their maturity level with skyrocket and they'll be like their big brother/sister. You know as well as I do that younger kids (as well as teenagers, I must confess) have at least one thing on their mind: how to appear older. Apparently, in this day and age, "appearing older" equals having a boyfriend or girlfriend. It's sad, really.    As for the girl, Sandy, who simply did not comprehend a word you were saying, I truly pity her.|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	what is the question again?  are they  trolls? sure.|`|ijsudsQKaa	tell them there spouse are not yet born|`|a6XaTJBsaa	I'm 18 years old and I've been thinking the same thing too...

I share your concern on this matter.|`|5a1e44f940031f776284fcf3274bbc98aa	first, i like to say, that i'm like everybody here, and i'm worry when young people are asking question about relationship, or sex, or any other issue...  but...  i think it's great that they are asking...  because that means that they are concern about the subject, and they are seeking answers that maybe... they would be afraid to ask their parents.  So, the important thing is to answer honestly, and with our sets of value.  If we feel they are too young... we say soo... but don't judge...  because, they want answers...and opinion...  that's what this forum is all about.  So...  to answer your question, they can be trolls, but if they are not, and they are asking themselfs these questions... we should guide them, sometimes, when they hear what their parents would say, or have already said to them, by stranger, and it comes out the same way... it show them, that their parents make sense... and are not just repressive...|`|nYPWDBo2aa	so your 7?lol

zqlpK7HQaa	It is difficult to give a nice gift card for $15 or less, so I wouldn't go with only that.  Since you don't know her very well, you may want to do something sentimental.  Do you have an old picture of your best friend from his youth? - preferably something funny.  You can put that in an inexpensive picture frame (you can get them for $2 or $3) and give it as a gift with a nice note - something funny.  You could say - we never thought he'd do well enough to attract a nice girl like you.  I don't know if this is appropriate given your relationship, but use your own creativity.  With the money left over, you could get a $10 gift card to a music store and it won't seem so "cheap" because she'll have two gifts.|`|746169a998fa1f38584855dac63adc97aa	best buy gift card|`|L3IL0JXyaa	If she likes dance/trance/techno music then go out and buy her the "just be" album from DJ TIEsto.

AA11326266	My ex husbands family was this way, and OMG it drove me CRAZY!!! I mean this is how they handled everyone, friends, family, whoever. If they got into a big blow out argument, they could talk to them the next day as if absolutely nothing was wrong.  I think you need to NOT ignore the issue that caused the argument.  You need to have a sit down conversation about it so that the problem is resolved otherwise it's just gonna happen again. Right now it's on the back burner, but be prepared for when it happens again.|`|AA10306164	not knowing what the problem was,i'm gonna give this a shot.ask yourself why he might be acting like nothing happened.sometimes its not good to have a round two the next day.dragging something out could only make a bad situation even worse and maybe he knows that.and sometimes some problems never really get resolved,but depending on how big it was,that problem may never arise again.then ask yourself if ya really want to put the gloves on again anyways.remember,arguements stop being arguements and become fights (sometimes big ones)when your angry.if it was a problem that left you feeling hurt,then try something like"i'm sorry about last night.i was feeling really hurt and still am.can we not fight anymore and just talk?i just need to know everything is okay".or something to that effect.and the first moment it feels like its going from a heartfelt talk to an arguement,remind youreself and him that its a talk.and ask"do you love me enough to help me to stop feeling so hurt about this?".the only other advice i can offer not knowing what the situation entails is always remember that one secret of a lasting relationship is NEVER go to bed angry.|`|AA11813018	well if the prob is too big then u need to talk over it  else just 4get it maybe the other guy also 4got it thinking it to be trivial.  its 4 u 2 decide what 2 do.|`|fd279c14ed968506de6579f6cf212d03aa	LOL that is how I solve crucial problems (RARELY) and nonsense problems (COMMONLY), it is very natural, and it lies within the border of untold wisdom. Usually,after a big fight that caused one's potential to rise up to more than 200% to keep the anger down... something tends to trigger within that certain person and tells them that they can just ignore the problem. Or, maybe the person has nothing to lose if they ignore the problem. Also, this may happen if they are close friends with you and don't want to risk your friendship. Or they are stupid and cool with stuff.    Um, well if you are capable and can ignore it...then it is fine, just ignore it... But if you wanna talk about the fight, I suggest you go for it.|`|ir2Tpwkoaa	im going thru a similar thing with my friend at the moment, she just wants to forget it but I want to talk about it.  I think you should put it on the backburner for now, just enjoy your friend's company.. and when the time is right, discuss it properly when nobody is pissed off or upset about it.  You will resolve issues this way and become closer friends.  Good luck!|`|Nzk46Gbqaa	maybe he just misses you.... he finally realized he was wrong, so he just thought that he would talk to you like really nothing happened instead of not talking to you and being lonely. sometimes it's just weird, but i think they have no other chance. my opinion|`|z9EH56ghaa	Hi som,    A relationship is always base on the truth. Relationship is not easy, but if you have a partner that is fair, I don't see why you won't be able to settle your differences.  The biggest mistake one can make in a relationship is to let go of something that is bothering you.  Talk to him and tell him how you are feel.  Rather than trying to point out whose fault it is and who did what, try to try to approach the issue more positive way.
Nl3gGGWuaa	I usually figure that she's the type that other chics hate on alot, so she just naturally gravitates to men. Sometimes really pretty chics have this problem cuz ugly and average lookin chics are jealous and/or intimidated by them. Of course they can think you're a slut, but the guys know the deal and so do you. They may think that, but those same chics never have the guts to ask any of those guys they see flocking about the chic if she's known as a slut among the guys. It probably makes the nosey loser "observing" chics feel better about themselves by branding the girl a slut cuz most of them WISH they could hold the attention of that many guys for that long! Guys may be less catty, but it is somewhat unhealthy to not have ANY female friends. I have a cousin like that. The only female friends she has are blood relatives and women alot older than her. Although it would be nice for you to make somewhat of an effort to gain some female buddies, don't break your neck trying it if it's not working. You shouldn't waste much time worrying about shallow females. Just do what you do and keep moving forward with your life.|`|306662f774163a405c45b57131783a9daa	I can tell you that the general perception of the public when a girl has way more male friends than she does female friends is that the girl is a $lut.  And I can tell you that psychologists say that this is an unhealthy situation in a social sense, for the girl involved is sexually preoccupied and will not develop the social relationship skills she will need later in life when dealing with women because of this.  As for myself?  It just makes me think that the girl would be easy to get into bed.|`|AA11122828	NO, not at all.|`|45j1dRFKaa	no, you're just more compatible with guys.|`|yDlEniF4aa	if you want to have a lot of guy friends that is fine but rememeber this, most of your guy friends would have sex with you given the chance, and you will never have a great relationship with any guy if you have alot of male friends it is your choice. life sucks that way.
RVuFrKAIaa	ugh get a life....
AA11573312	Know the feeling, been through it before.  Take your time and see what happens.  For me, that meant taking a break and taking some 'me' time to figure out what I needed.  Sounds a little messed up, but it worked.  I am still with my man and we are enjoying each other so much.  But just remember that there is a reason that you are feeling the way you do now, and something like that just doesn't disappear.  You're probably young, and there is still a lot of life to experience. Have fun, but don't limit yourself...your happiness should be your  1 concern and if you aren't happy where you are, then it's time to reevaluate.  Good luck!  :)|`|1f8fce11e2ea33b9ee621c4273e1f857aa	Don't act too quickly, things can change, but also don't stay in a relationship just for him. Good luck.|`|ynxYZtFOaa	I think u'd be wit him who loves u, and u said u also love him....so dont think of brking the relation up so quickly!  Tell him wat u feel abt him, and beside this u think y r u feeling so! Is there anything abt him which is making u think so!? Any attitude or anything of him u dont like? Find it out and tell him to change that behavior..    I think u r feeling that he is paying less importance to u than before so u r feeling like that.....Discuss wit him.|`|Ago5yr1Daa	I can relate to this completely.  She told me "we grew apart" and "it's not you it's me".  She just recently came back and wants to work things out after a year of being apart.  Growing up I was told if you love some thing let it go......I'm sure you've heard it yourself.  It helps sometimes to just step away from the monotany of a relationship.  In some cases you end up developing a better appreciation for who your with.  Then again you may not.  Good luck.

lH6iMg5Jaa	I used to be the same way you are now up until I ended up with a guy whom I was with for 1 1/2 years. I was so afraid to be myself because I didn't think anyone would like who I really am so I never talked around people I didn't know. This guy just changed my life and showed me that who I am is a nice girl. I'm not with him as of two months ago, but were still friends which is hard for me because he was the only guy I was myself around. What I'm getting at is you have to look around and see all of those girls that aren't shy. There are SOO many girl that don't care what other people think and can just be themselves. Some of those girls are nice, some are mean, some love drama, some are party girls, and you can see that no two girls are exactly alike. You know you are a nice person, and you knwo you are funny, but you if you don't let people see that then they won't see what a great girl you really are. My confidence level is down the drain, but I just had to get it through my head that not everyone will like me and I won't like everyone I see in my life. It so hard not to care what other people think because I think deep inside everybody does. I was that girl that tagged along with ym friends always wishing to be one of them until I realized that they have a lot of flaws, and so do I. I will never be perfect, and neither will you. People are so scared to be themselves becase they have an image of what "perfect" is in their head and can't be that person. Well, I will never be that dream girl I see in my head. I moved on from my drinking friends, and decided that it's okay if I'm not like them. I don't ever want to drink or do drugs or party, and I am so happy I moved away from them because thats all they ever did. The reason why nobody will listen to you is because you won't talk. I never got that either until I started to talk to guys and I wasn't afraid to be me. Not everyobdy will like me in this life and I just have to be the best person I can be. You can overcome this, and I thinkif you do then people will listen to you and if you just be your own person, they will look up to you. When I was shy people used to hate me because they thought I wasn't talking to them because I thought I was too good for them which was such a misunderstanding. I really hope you realize that you are a wonderful person and you can be who you want to be. Someone will love who you are, I promise. And one leads to more. You will be looked up to and people will be like ohh my gosh why wasn't that girl always like that? She is so sweet! If you ever need more help feel free to talk. I really hope you can be the person screaming to come outside of you. It's hard, but trust me, If I can do it i think anyone can do it.|`|HxET88bDaa	Read Eckart Tolle's "Power of Now".     It will teach you to see who you "REALLY" are.     Have some self belief, everyone has a right in life to be happy, if you believe it truely it will do wonders for you.|`|AbPdsFknaa	Go away somewhere on a camp for the summer, meet new people that don't even know you and you'll open up more.  Think it's just you need to get away from your past.  Good luck with trying to open up and love yourself for who you are.|`|AA11296489	I agree with another poster. You need to pick up an activity that you can enjoy and work at. It will build confidence. It will be really  scary at first for a quiet, careful person, but it is a fantastic way to meet friends with similar interests. Having some close friends can really help.     I was in your shoes over 10 years ago and then I started volunteering. I met some really fun people who became my support system. Once you know you aren't alone, you really won't fall on your face and people really aren't thinking the worst of you, life will be a much better place. It is exhausting trying to be everything to everyone, so its best to just try and please yourself.     Someone (guys I mean) WILL notice you. I know it feels like guys are the most important thing in the world when you're 16, but you should enjoy your time before you have to start dealing with them!     Definitely enjoy being 16 and I wish you well!|`|6faaa2035adcba4d42993d2eb782b684aa	I know exactly how you feel. I used to feel like you, to be honest. Up until the age of 16 I was a very shy girl who barely ever talked to people unless she really HAD to.   I'm almost 18 now, and I've gotten much better. The key is to watch loads of celebrity interviews to be honest (no, I'm not joking). At least that's what helped me. As you're watching interviews with your fave celebs, notice how confident they are, realise how great it is that they don't care about all the false rumours about them in the papers and how they're just happy with themselves. Now try to become like them.   If it's hard in the beginning, try to pretend you're confident. The next  time you're at a party, ACT confident and go and talk to a new girl or something. Do this for a while, and after a while, you will BECOME confident, and it will no longer be just acting. Good luck!   P.S. It's not bad to be a bit shy. Guys actually like shy girls! ;)|`|9b7dae319feaff5863f63ef2ed29012faa	are you me!!    i guess i have the same problem - once someone gets to know me I'm a delight, but otherwise i really feel low about myself.    one thing though.. you honestly sound like a really sweet girl. i'm not just saying this, but your sound like you're a quality girl - the typa girl who'd be the best m8 ever, and most caring gf...    ... i'd definately go out with a girl like you!    Cheer up... and dont worry; there are so many people just like you... for me, I guess I'm just terrified of taking that first step/move with anyone; be it just small talk or talking to a girl...    just gather your confidence, and think hey - what am i gona loose? im telling you, it would be a priveledge to so many people to have a friend like you =D      WOW  I JUST SAW ALL YOUR QUESTIONS :|    40 questions just like this! don't you see; you're holding yourself back.

Remember you are special whether other people think so or not, talk to people and be nice to them and they will like you... you should open to IM, I would be your friend... I will listen to you...    If you have something you like like sports or some interest try getting really into it and joining a group or something, then you know there will be people with your interest.    You know you are nice and funny, now you have to find a way to show other people... but remember what they say doesnt really matter when it comes to who you are.    And dont worry that people will talk about you... if you are quiet why would they?  Please dont feel like that about yourself, it feels so bad I know.|`|alm96dtIaa	i think u need a make over gets some clothers u don't usually wear  and get your hair done and do your make up that help me it boost my confidence up|`|HDxMYKOkaa	ok you just need to believe that no matter what anyone says or does,  you are better than that. if they are negative or rude, then they are bitches. you need to focus on having faith in yourself, because if you dont who will? plus when you are confidant about yourself, people notice. and you look like you are fearless. and that intimidates people. so trust me on this one. :)|`|Vi2MSYDDaa	OK step on out there everyone does something wrong every once in a life time don't be afraid to talk you have a very peaceful mind and you have alot ahead of you and you can be any thing you want to be! you might be shy but put that behind and look at things like an adventure go out there and explore! have some fun make friends and one day you might come across the one of your dreams!|`|kkFJql15aa	I KNOW YOU ARE REALLY A NICE PERSON I WAS JUST LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS 16 ,BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU IT GET HARDER BEING SHY WHEN YOU GET OLDER JUST TRY TO FIND 3 OR 4  GOOD FRIENDS THAT STICK BY YOU|`|qLWdwgjzaa	I am/was like you but i tried to believe in myself more and have faith in the things i could do,feel more proud about my accomplishments.think about how important you are to others,that you are not alone in this world and there are ppl who genuinely care for you.i would try to be good at something so that i could put eveything i have into it and stop worrying about what others might think.because in reality,ppl only care for themselves,so it is all in your mind.join societies to make friends.u sound like a sweet person,i'm sure there are others who would like to make friends with you.when u realise that you're too cool to care about what others think of you,you'll feel much liberated.stay strong.if you need someone to talk to i'll lend you my ears :]|`|vr7JGYYXaa	If you like sports then throw yourself into them. If you're more academic then focus on that. Find something that you ENJOY and don't let ANYTHING bring you down whilst you're doing it.     It could be dancing alone in your room, pretending your a ballerina, it doesn't matter as long as it makes you happy.     Talktofrank if you want...    You're frineds WILL WANT TO HELP if you can confide in them. Don't feel like you're alone, because you're not!!    Meditation can be extremly helpful, and don't feel silly doing it!!     I hope this helps and i hope you feel better sooner rather then later!

4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	My husband and I have been married for over 20 years, we'll celebrate  21 in January, and make a point to do something together.  It may not be much, but we do make the effort.  Sometimes we'll try to go out of town together, but sometimes all we can manage is dinner out.      I would tell your husband how you feel about his saying it's not that special.  I will tell you, this is the sort of thing women pay WAY more attention to than guys do, and if this is your 1st wedding anniversary, then you need to set the precedent here.  Let him know what you expect, husbands aren't mind readers.  Do this gently and lovingly, and don't try to make him feel that he's a bad husband by saying that it's not that big of a deal or nothing special.  That will backfire on you big time.      Good luck!|`|ZVHq9GcLaa	i celebrated my fist year anniversary on august 18th =)  we went to ottawa for our anniversary. my hubby was planning a trip to hawaii, but his boss wouldn't let him off work so we ended up going to ottawa instead. i was happy with that still because i got to see my godson for the first time =)    i am sorry that your hubby said there is nothing special about an anniversary. that is to bad|`|55c9284564717df1b8a670f05041ea26aa	We will .... already into our 13th year, going onto 14th .... we make it a point to share the moment with our kids and family .... however simple it may be|`|ltw2rfwnaa	I'm not getting married until next year, but of course we plan on celebrating our anniversary! :)|`|AA10264604	Been married 31 years, and we've celebrated all 31.

y3fXw2DIaa	My hubby is your size. & i'm 5'2 125lbs. It's great cause we can give each other piggy-back rides! lol.   Don't worry, NOT ALL girls want big bulky guys. i mean look around when you're out--couples come in all varieties. short, tall, fat, thin, young, old, etc. you cant control who you fall in love with--no matter what your "type" is.|`|lXy5s89saa	personally i like average height shinny guys. i hate big and buff.|`|YUHZsqkiaa	well,i know first off people call me tall and im only 5.6 but i think alot of girls like taller guys because they seem manly or something,idk but i don't really see y height even matters|`|1P8F08cFaa	Like. For me, If i dated someone shorter than me, or younger than me, I'd think they were like my little brother. I would make the girl seem like a monster next to her shorter skinner boyfriend.|`|RO4snSF4aa	I'm 5'4 so 5'7 would be good for me =]  And by the way 5'7 isn't even short?   Oh and one more thing, wouldn't you rather be 135 lbs then 335 lbs?  I think you're fine. Don't worry.    And to the first 2 answers, I'm sure you are both very beautiful people both inside and out.|`|QZp15FQBaa	okay 5'7" is nott short, so u have nothing to worry about =]    please help me with my question? (:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|efZRUEdZaa	I've never been attracted to short guys. Taller is sexier. Maybe you should just find a really short girl (like 5'2'' or shorter). That you'll be tall in her opinion.|`|XxR1CxHQaa	it doesn't matter to me. i like tall guys but i also dated someone a few inches shorter than me.|`|8aGyPE9Jaa	5'7 is not that short. be happy that you're not a midget.    honestly, height does matter, but so does looks!  keep yourself in shape, wear nice clothes, maintain your hair etc etc.  seriously.  girls will LOVE you.    my boyfriend  thinks he's not "tall" enough. he's 5'11, weighs 140 lbs and is goregeous. i think he is just ridiculous as you are (: it all depends on some girl's tastes.   i like my boys skinny and taller than me.|`|iUU1CXF6aa	ew i hate short guys!!|`|99oQ0L3yaa	i hate  that|`|cyzLn0UWaa	its better thn short and fat im 5'8 and 190lbs ah ha ha ha it sucks to be short!|`|9iPSxFZmaa	Don't worry about it. Really. My boyfriend of two years is almost the same height as me, and plays soccer so he is fit, not so bulky. So obviously, as a female, his height (or lack there of) doesn't bother me. Plus, with this rise in the indie and emo (whatevs) fad, skinny guys have totally been made super attractive. I wouldn't worry about it because when all is said and done, a woman will want to settle down with a guy who will protect her emotionally, financially, and will not focus on his height and superficial things such as this.|`|AA10982922	what's wrong with being a little shorter than everage ?after all ,looks are important up to a certain level when you discover that a no brain sexy macho is a real turn downer ,and a smart , funny but shorter guy is so damn hot.well , my opinion , anyway. i always preferred brains over looks.ok , don't take me wrong , i wouldn't date the hunchback of notredame , but i had short and tall boyfriends , as long as i had interesting things to talk to them.  i know a saying that says:  good essences are kept in small bottles.|`|pAdlNAqSaa	It depends, I think a lot of girls also get kind of scared by tall and big guys, especially petite ones. Some don't but I've always liked dating guys that are about my size. I like being able to look someone in the eye, and I don't have to worry about being crushed or accidentally hurt.    The problem with skinny, shorter guys is that they often lack self-esteem and confidence--and often over-compensate and try to be super macho (what a huge turn off) Or if you are as tall or taller than the guy, then they end up feeling emasculated and take it out on you, by trying to make you feel bad (huge, unattractive or fat).     So in a relationship, you end up having to boosts your boyfriend's confidence all the time. And that's not something you want to have to do to your boyfriend.     Work on your confidence (and not that outside cocki-ness that some men think is confidence, but just a quiet belief in yourself) and women will find you attractive.     It's that simple. Shape and size don't matter, but the confidence does a lot.     And when women are attracted to someone, they can be attracted to so many things (your hands, your smell, your smile, your touch, your feel, the way you hug etc) that they often overlook the not-so-flattering sides.  And a good flirt will always be attractive.|`|pPNZwbKDaa	Short and thin isn't bad at all. I'm short and I usually go for the skinny guys!|`|5H5VrOgBaa	If a girl wants to judge you by how tall or short you are then let her. You cant control that...when you find the one, she will love you the way she is, dont worry about all of these people!!! I thought i was short and i hated it, i am 5'6 now and i like it...i jsut thought i cant control it so why let it bother me....you have to like yourself before anyone else can like you! Confidence is the sexiest thing you can wear....good luck hun and dont worry about what people say...my mom always used to tell me this....all good things come in small packages!!!!! :) Hope this helps keep your head up!|`|7CC9OI2Maa	Well As you can see short and thin guys aren't really there type   But just start going to the gym a little more and eating healthy but more if that will help you with your self to feel better   And about the height just go for a shorter girl,  You will Find someone, that likes you just for you.|`|B4C6tuZuaa	youre not that short. the average height for a girl is about 5'4'' so they are plenty girls that you are taller than. unless your into tall chicks than just look for the hot little ones, there are A LOT of them out there. what i've found is you can win ANY girl with either money or personality, depending on their personality (one being a greed hungry whore and the other being a descent person).|`|GZjFweX2aa	Personally, I think that people waste too much time on looks and bodies. What I really care for is the personally of a boy. I don't care how tall or short he is or how thin or big he is. As long as he is nice and funny and respectful. And I think that's how many girls think. Don't focus on what girls like just be your self and maybe they will change their minds on what they like in a boy.
AA11102582	Okay, first of all change your phone numbers or at least block him from calling and texting. Remember, you stated that he was emotionally and physically ABUSIVE!!  You are rid of him now. All he's trying to do is make you jealous so that you'll come running back to him so he can treat you bad again or even worse.  I know this because I was married to an abuser.  You've gotten away from him  now so it's your job to stay away from him. Don't be dumb...don't let yourself be played like that.  There are millions of women that die every year from men like that.  Count  yourself as lucky and wash your hands and mind of that jerk. There are plenty of great guys out there who NEVER raise their hands in anger to their women. They treat their women like queens.  Start looking elsewhere and start thanking God that jerk is out of your life. Just keep it that way. If you have to...get a restraining order and keep it updated. That way if he comes near you he can be locked up with the other degenerates.  Good luck honey!|`|mEpJUCBbaa	Yes, he is definitely trying to make you jealous.  This guy is obviously hungry for power... if the physical and mental abuse isn't evidence enough, I don't know what is. When you dumped him, you took some of that power away. Now he is trying to regain it back by making you jealous....don't let him have it. This is his subtle way of trying to control you. I am not trying to blame you, but you're definitely not helping the situation by continuing to talk to him. Get a new cell phone or block his phone  .  Whatever you do, you need to be more resolute...no more "break up then make up" sessions. You say that the break up is "for real this time" but what makes you so sure you're not going to "make up" with him again?   You want to know why his jealousy tactic is working...because you're letting it. Why are you looking @ his facebook page? If you don't look at his facebook page, then you won't see the pictures...there will be nothing to be jealous about.  De-friend this fool, automatically delete all his text messages, and keep it moving!|`|tYlWvuvYaa	He is trying to make you jealous, and it's working because you're letting him do it.    Remember, he's the one who hurt you.  Why would you want to go back into something like that?  He wants you back, but you are much better than him and deserve someone who will treat you with respect and love.    Even if it's not true, catch him off guard with something like "My new boyfriend doesn't appreciate what you're trying to do here.  I'm quite happy with him, and I don't want you back."  You might not have that new boyfriend yet, but you will, and it will still be true then.  Don't let this guy get to you.  He isn't worthy of you at all.|`|LcT0hqzZaa	Its working coz you still care. But for your own goodness, finish this game, you are use to be on and off all the time, but in a while you ll be the only one hurt. Try something to keep him out of your mind and trust me, there are plenty of awesome guys everywhere, just take your time and dont focus yourself only in one right now.|`|Cf3q9mw0aa	Yeah he is definatly trying to make you jealous.   Just don't worry about it, completely ignore his attempts to get your attention and just laugh at the pictures he posts.   But whatever you do, don't compete with him, by all means go and get yourself a new man but don't compete with your ex because then it'll just be harder to forget him.|`|ygaqZGyNaa	well first of all any physically abusing relationship you odn't want to be in at all.  No one deserves that and I know you can do better.  I hate my ex and I know that seeing him with another girl is hard.  I don't know if he is trying to make you jealous or not, I still really can't figure out guys for myself, so whenever i try to think why guys do things it is just a lost cause.  As far as him and his new girlfriend, just let it go.  I know that is hard, cause I understand the slight bit of jealousy thing.  He is her problem now and hopefully she realizes what type of guy he is.  And once again I am going to stress don't put up with physical or emotional abuse, at that point know that there is someone out there that will not make you feel that way, and that person will come.|`|IjqsSbS3aa	Dont respond. Hes totally trying to make you jealous, me being a guy, would try that. I admit, its dumb, but your falling into it, so its working. Blow HIM off. He'll feel even worse.|`|N8aQ64Ctaa	aww... u still have feelings [sorry]  well ya do. this hapnd 2 me. do u still want him bak no matter what yal went thru all the bull and EVERYTHNG b/c if u do n ur tryn to convince yourself u dnt ur gona have a hard time thru hell b4 u actualy "stop havn the feeling". be real with yourself b/c if u were done with him u wouldnt have those jealousy feelings.    :)|`|lXXuF0T4aa	He's a big liar. He;s just saying he told her he pushed you so you wont and he can keep her to control.(when he never told her )  Don;t be jealous because, why be jealous of someone who gets beaten?  Or jealous of someone who makes you angry and treats you badly?    Trust me. I was in the same boat as you. I got out of it and i have a much better boyfriend.    Move on. Its healthier, safer, and live a happier life.|`|f8d92f3eb007519c9b860a9f841dfb1caa	Listen, you don't need that asshole. I dont think you're neccessarily want him back. I just think that its natural that you guys break up and u see him with aother girl. Theres gonna be a little jelousy. The same thing if he saw u with another guy. I saw forget his woman beating ***. LEAVE HIM ALONE. Obviouslt he doent care about you if he's out with some other girl. So just leave it at them. No calling, texting, comments..NOTHING! Then HE'LL be the one thats jelous, because he'll realize that you honestly dont care and that you're past him already. So my advice is pay him NO MIND AT ALL! Get a new kind, sweet RESPECTFUL fella. One who won't physically or mentally abuse you.|`|yOqPrvmDaa	Well yes he is trying to make you jealous to make you think that he still has control over you. && don't let him know it's working because if you do then he knows he still controls you...  It's working because well you have had sttrong feelings for him through everything so you just have to ignore him..|`|H3pNhyNeaa	I think he is trying to make you jealous, letting go is one of the hardest things to do. you get so accustomed to someone being there and when they aren't it doesn't feel right|`|ErNNjUdjaa	It sounds like he is trying to make you jealous...  But it depends on how long you guys have been broken up for?  If it has been a day then YES totally he is....  If it has been a month then maybe mainly yes though...  If it has been more than a month then maybe yes and maybe no... Depends on how much he liked you...  And if it has been a whole bunch of months then you maybe just still like him and he has moved on... It stinks but it can happen...|`|19gXwmRqaa	Yah he is trying to make you jealous. Don't notice it.

You can't be worried about someone like her when you're in college.  Besides that, you're going to meet a lot of other ladies when in college.

Talk to her, tell her your concerns and how her actions make you feel.  The way she responds will let you know how seriously she takes your relationship.  Communication and honesty are the only way any relationship will work.  If it does happen that she's just not mature enough yet don't blame her. She may just need more time in growing up.  Stay her friend but if the two of you expect different things out this relationship then neither one of you are going to be happy. Good luck honey.
AA11102582	Okay I understand about being shy. It's not the most wonderful feeling either.  But, at some point you are going to have to come out of your comfort zone to make some friends.  You say you like this guy. And from what you say he likes you too.  Sounds as if he may be shy also (judging from the no eye contact).  Invite him out.  That's the only way you're really going to know. The worse thing that can happen is that he says no.  You won't die and you won't get sick... you will be disappointed. But, as they say, "It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all."  Life's too short for not taking a risk now and then.  Sometimes, by taking risks is the only way we gain anything in this world at all. Good luck honey!!|`|CLdn18wIaa	I liked a guy once and I was shy and he is extremely shy.

Or maybe even a group project.  It will be easiest to transition to a social situation from this comfort zone.  Maybe after you all have worked together and have had some time alone, ask him out.

Tell her to tone it down a bit, and not message you so much. Say that you need some space.    She seems like a very hyper and expressive person, who is looking for attention. Does she have any hobbies? Maybe you could encourage her to seek out some kind of hobby, like writing, art, poetry, music, or sports? Something that keeps her occupied, and gives her something else to talk about.|`|e39ab69446bac2ae25b91a2021d1e6d7aa	You have to be cruel to be kind, try telling her again that she's annoying but tell her straight.  if you don't she'll only move onto someone else and annoy them so you may as well do her a favour!  Just tell her something like - i'm going to say something now and i want you to hear me out to the very end before you say anything or judge what i'm saying until i'm completely finished ok? You are a nice person with a good heart and kind eyes but sometimes you can be really suffocating and needy.  i'm not sure if you can see that you're doing it but i think, if it were me i would rather someone tell me than let me carry on being annoying.   you have to learn to tone it down a little and not be quite so intense all the time....        i hope that helps a little?    if all else fails just stop replying to her and cross your fingers.    good luck!|`|whBhPFWkaa	I once had this happen to me.

If its constant on a lot of same repeating letters maybe her keyboard is broke, like she says. If she continues it all you can do is keep telling her that it annoys you and it makes you angry. Maybe she's just trying a bit too hard to be your friend. Make it known that she doesn't need to try so hard, that just being friendly and being casual is more than enough, and she doesn't have to leave constant messages and so forth.    Maybe in the end, you do need to block her but give her a chance. As for the little sister, depending on her age, little kids DON'T need to be on the internet. It does seem like these kids needs more supervision when it comes to their internet use.  |`|yqzp312faa	i had same problem wht i did was:                      1.ignore her for a few weeks (by any means nessersary-                      by blocking her email address & when she walks                      past dont look at her just look straight ahead or the                      the other way                     2. after a week or 2 she should ask 'why arnt you speaking                      to me'.

But given your respective ages, she'll probably think, "OMG, he doesn't like me anymore!"    Since she doesn't want to be in a relationship, you have no obligation to call her every day.  Back off, and make it every other day for a little while.|`|3sTWBmVpaa	If it's one day, it won't be a big deal. If you start to stop calling her, she'll assume you don't like her as much anymore or that you're annoyed with her not being able to make up her mind.|`|yTEP4L3Taa	Just don't be so available anymore. Make her wonder what you are doing and why you haven't been calling her like you usually do. |`|dkqObFeQaa	Well.. as long as she isn't going out with the "other" boy then you are ok. You need to try to persuade her to "GO OUT" with you.. not as a bf/gf thing.. but just for fun.. tell her to go check out a movie.. or make some good news up and ask her to come out and eat with you to celebrate.. etc.. make sure you make it as much fun as possible so she enjoys going out with u and wants to continue to do it, without thinking of it as a bf/gf thing.. Also.. dont talk to her everyday.. when women know they have you in the palm of their hand.. calling them daily and kissing their booty all day, they know they have you and will play you.. so give her the "GIFT" of missing you.. call her every other day.. or wait until SHE calls you.. and you will see she will be all over you.. wondering why you aint calling as much and what you are doing etc etc.. trust me kiddo.. be suave.|`|IzTTAbpTaa	  Well ask yourself this do u LIKE HER??  probably so but just take it slow and I bet you u guys will be a couple by whatever... Don't be a stalker or anything just call her like almost everyday and say hi and have like short conversations one day and long conversations the next day.  All you have to do...                         - by attitud3~! luv ya! |`|c88cb9681074935f0d4e57d1f69da70faa	i think u should wait till u know her true fellings towords u , but i think too that she is playing with ur feelings so think well befor telling her any thing about ur fellings .
d36e3a86f94b39f013ac81ebab4a593daa	the only advice i can give you for now is just deal with the bi/tches. i know it sucks for now but think when you are out of school you don't ever have to deal with them again, so stay focused on your schoolwork and not what is "in" and you will be the one laughing later when you graduate from a good college, have a great career and a nice family and home. good luck.|`|AA11391024	Well I'm pretty different(I can relate). I don't think changing schools will solve your problem because it will happen in every school. Also there might be someone else that you haven't noticed which is like you. I have a side frindge is it so annoying because i have to put like a tonne of hairspray to keep it in place and anyways side fringes get in your eyes and will make you cross eyed. So be happy that in 10 years your going to have good eyes. Have you throught of a front fringe or another hairstyle because you might make it "in style". And finally i think the key is BE CONFIDENT and if you want loud but not attention seeking loud just normal LOUD. |`|n7D0coF2aa	just remember your not the only one who feels that way....    just ignor them and tell them to butt out of your life its your life and you want to live it your way and if they have a problem then tell them  too bad and to shut the hell up =)    hope it helps =)|`|7dyzaIWlaa	Um ok... i kinda have that problem    I know this sounds really cliche butjust love yourself for who you are and people will love you for who you are too    seriously  ihave a side fringe and i'd actually rather i had a middle part... just because EVERYONE has side fringes    yeah|`|ge56n2dZaa	Jesus, they sound really stupid.  Who cares who has a f*****g side fringe?!  Don't get one, just to annoy them! I wouldn't get one!   Tell them you don't want to look like a clone of everyone else thanks very much!    I think that maybe you should spend some time alone to be honest. It doesn't sound very appealing, but trust me, sometimes it's what you REALLY need.  Just take a day or two where you don't really talk to anyone, just find a quiet corner at lunch or whatever and do something you like doing.   For me, I'd sit with my iPod on. You might want to read, or draw, or just sit there and watch the world go by.  Trust me, I've had this before, and sitting on your own for a while really does help.|`|8dwTwGA2aa	well just work your way up to being self confident, try going on your own style and just be your self don't listen what other people say about you. |`|4c2cb618b8c167d7beb0c2cc5a36fe4faa	:D I have been suffering with the same problem since my childhood but if you really want to get out of this situation then nobody but only you can help yourself. How??? Well I'll tell you how...from my own experience!     You said that the girls in your class are POPULAR! Okay can you elaborate the exact meaning of being 'Popular'? There are 3 categories:    1) Girls who are always around guys. Girls who are look conscious and trying to impress every guy on this planet with their so called beauty(without brains)    2)This category of girls are totally spoilt. They are popular due to their ill habits(say drugs and stuff) You know bad publicity also works! So these girls are popular in the 'bad peer' section.    3)These girls are unlike the above two. They are academically good. Good with other curricular activities.Looks wise, pretty and smart. Great attitude.(does not mean that they start abusing or get rude) These girls are leaders. They know what they want in life. They are not affected by what others say. In fact people come to them for advices and opinions. Nobody can fool these girls with their innocent and sweet talks cause God has given brains to these girls.      Trust me, no matter how many guys are hooked with the other 2 types, they will always prefer the 3rd category when it comes to making good friends or being with a girl who has brains or who can give them a tough competition where other curricular activities are involved.    And its not only about guys but even girls would come to you when messed up with some problem. Problem could be any.(academics. sports, suggestion or even company)    If you are interested in the 3rd category, then my dear you will have to work hard. If you want to be the leader then you must know that a leader is always alone. People follow the leader! So dont worry if you don't have good friends cause i feel that its better to be alone and do things you like instead of being with people who have no concern for you.     Always Remember...its not important whether you are popular or not but its very important whether people respect you or not. The pretty looking babes in your class might be popular but when it comes to gaining respect amongst guys, i am sure that the score is negative.    So cheer up and Rock on!  All the best. :)    P.S. Next time these girls ask you about the fringe, just say," fit in?? in what?? The monkey look alike competition where everybody is getting one like you guys? Sorry dear but I don't follow what everybody follows. I have my own style which is unique in its own way and I don't need any advice from monkeys. Monkeys copy...Humans Dont! Thank you very much!"    Don't raise your voice or get irritated. Just turn...look at them...smile and say this in a firm voice and when you are finished, just leave. Don't wait for them to answer cause you are not interested in their silly talks, are you? ;)
NKPZsGxdaa	LOL, they can, if they know u very well and they arent interested in anything we consider actually important at the moment. Its because ur moods are friggin nuts. I agree with Bob there, lol, they make scenes.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	There's not a whole lot they can do but say "there, there" and listen to us.  We need to tell them what is wrong and what we want from them; the poor things aren't mind readers & they don't seem to be able to pick up on our signals.  Women are really better at picking up on things.  When I was sad or in a bad mood I would just tell my guy of the moment that I was and that I needed a "there, there" and a hug and a listening post.  It worked every time and I ended up feeling better.  Just accept it|`|RlzyuOY0aa	Because female moods are COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL, though you don't realize it because you are girls so they make senes to you.    But they are completely off the level. Think about it, do they actually make sense considering our POV and circumstances?

bNrlI7eiaa	This is gonna be kinda long, but if you really need help read it all.    First, I know how you feel. Not completely (cause I'm not you), but mostly. I've felt the same way many times (well, not the married part) and what's next is is what I always follow.    1) How many times have you gotten together and then broken up? If it's more than, say, 3 times, someone isn't serious here.     2) Who was the one breaking up? If you've broken up with him half the time or more, HE may be the one who thinks YOU don't like him.    3) Open up to your guy, and tell him how you feel. After all, you will have to have many talks if you really want to get married. But beware of opening up too much. If he isn't sure about wanting to love you, opening up too much to him could give him the fuel to say no. (He may be afraid that you will tell him every little thing that happens to you, and some guys don't like that.)    4) Tip about  3: Make sure to tell him how you feel about him having sex with every jane, susan, and maya. Maybe he thinks that you don't care about it.    5) Maybe this is his way of saying "I'm bored with you"? Some guys just have an aversion to saying "I want to break up". |`|AA10239861	because most men are so stupid!!!!!!!     there are a few good ones but the ones wastin ur time gotta go!!
aYhJp9hHaa	I am 30 years old, i don't think its alot, it all depends on the type of relationships you are having, theres nothing wrong with dating a guy for a few months sleeping with him and then moving on. |`|tqov8treaa	I think 3 is more than average especially at 20.

Hopefully this will be the 4th and final. I do regret being so carefree about it the first three times. Although they were all serious boyfriends, I should've realized at 16 years old that I wasn't gonna stay with this guy forever and waited for something more real.|`|ZJYoM1jaaa	That all depends on you... How do you feel about this? Obviously this is an issue for you if you are writing about it. Just a word of advise "You can not control the past, but you can change the future." So be more selective who you sleep with and you will feel better about your self in the end.|`|AA11421882	I'm 22 and I've slept with 5 guys, but none of them were serious boyfriends and alot of them were friends with benefits, which looking back I feel sort of badly about.  I've fooled around with 3 other guys but didn't go all the way (mainly oral and such).      I lost my virginity a month before my 21st birthday.  We were best friends, but not so much anymore.  Unfortunately sex really did complicate everything.    I dont think 3 is alot but if it's bothering you than maybe take a break, that's what I'm doing.  Oh, and not to sound preachy, but please make sure to use protection! :)|`|AA10184443	I was 13 and in love.

90XVgs1laa	Sorry to hear about your rough time.  Your husband has been continually cheating on you.. how long? how many? how much truth?    Now HE has finally become dedicated to try and make things work!!    I think you have the answer you were looking for. It is a kind of back hand apology from him by NOW HE wants to make it work. Now that you have regained a little of your self esteem by him actually wanting this - I believe you will walk away.    That is why things are not the same. Part of you knows he will do it again - he is only  sorry until the next time he is caught.    And there lies the problem is he sad because of what he did to your or sad that he was caught out.    You don't say if you have children.  You asked if this was the end of your love for him - I believe you already know the answer -you just wanted verification of your thoughts.    Wishing you every happiness in the future. x.  Time for change and a new beginning.|`|AA12024471	It's been my experience that if they ever cheat, they won't stop. It might be awhile, but they always do it again. Move on sister,you're better off,trust me!|`|bbanyuEoaa	It's good to hear that he's become dedicated and is trying to make things work. I do think it is important to for both of you to come to the point of forgiveness. Of course your love suffers after being betrayed. Forgiveness is the basis of rebuilding of love. Is he repentant? Is he seeking for forgiveness? Are you seeking to forgive? It will not happen instantly, but if you both work on it and acknowledge how hard it is to forgive, you may find your relationship get to a deeper level.     The short answer is, I don't think this is the end of your love for him, but it will take effort to rebuild your trust and respect for each other. It is so good that you are trying to get help (as your question here suggests). Maybe a therapist, and how about praying together? How about praying for more love for him? There have been examples of strong women seeking to live a life worthy of God's calling and rebuild their marriages by respecting and honoring their spouses.     I disagree with the quick decision for a divorce (that is not to say sometimes divorce may be the lesser evil). The divorce rate is higher after the first divorce, because people sometimes don't address the fundamental issues so they might run into the same scenarios again. I believe your marriage is worth protecting and fighting for. Every marriage is different. Sometimes maybe you have to offer the love first, then you will see it reciprocate. Sometimes you may have to search within to seek improvement within yourself. Sometimes you need to urge your husband to turn back and follow the right path. Sometimes you just have to trust the good outcome by doing the right thing.     |`|0XUt7MHHaa	If you find yourself questioning about your love for somebody, maybe you don't love them. But then again you just might feel that he would disappoint you again. Maybe you should try again with him before really deciding.|`|uzWYTQfeaa	It seems to me as if though you need to ask yourself if divoce is a wise option for you or not?    How would you know? I know of an article that talks a little more about it, and here it is:    http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990422/art...    If you want to give marriage one more try, remember that communication is key. Its one of the reasons why many couples let go.    I wish you the best. Sure seems like you are doing your part, and if not then more.    Hang in there, regardless of what you decide to do.|`|c2FtqCl9aa	i think that trust is the most important thing in any relationship and i don't think that you don't love him anymore it's just that you need time to get your self back together. i think he should give you some time and find out for your self if he still makes you happy.     i think that it is one thing to cheat on somebody when your just dating and another thing cheat when your in a marriage...but i'm a believer in people changing so i wish you the best of luck|`|pqUyVgpwaa	Ultimatly this is something only you can answer. However, I went through something similar in my first marriage and once you don't love them, you KNOW it. What I didn't know, was that I never did love my first husband. After I met and married my second husband and my love was so different and so strong, I realized that I never truely loved my first husband at all. Let me re-phrase that. I loved him, but I was never "in love" with him. I know it sounds cliche, but I never really knew what "in love" meant until my current husband. Perhaps you will discover the same thing some day with someone new.|`|ZHVCwYfOaa	sounds like you could use some time apart but if you truely love him you will look past the rocky times and make it work. If you dont want to even try than thats your answer you dont love him anymore. take a couple days apart and see how you do if you find yourself not caring what he is doing than its over. but   if you find yourself only thinking of him your not ready to let go yet!!|`|AA12395405	Love has very little to do with how you feel !  You need to have Faith in your Creator  and either continue to honor your vows or decide if it's quits!   If you're sure he's been creeping around on you, you may divorce him legally. |`|kALPhOJVaa	Hi:    I'm so sorry to hear that your husband has hurt you so.  I must be fair.  I don't live with either of you so I don't know all the details of your marriage.  I can only offer you some advice.    I know that the sting of betrayal is a hard thing to recover from.  Trust is lost; which is the foundation of any relationship (along with love).    - Do you feel that you husband's betrayal has destroyed all trust you had in him?  - Your husband may actually still love you but can he be trusted to remain faithful to you?  - Will you always feel suspicious about your husband's future activities and behavior ?    Your husband will have to work very hard to restore your trust in him in order for you to be happy again.  If you want to stay married and be able to trust your husband again, then I recommend that both of you go see a marriage counselor.  Work on those fidelity and trust issues and go forward from there.  However:  If you feel that the marriage is over, where you simply won't be able to trust your husband ever again, then you have every right to leave him.  I'm sorry for your heartache.  I hope my answer is helpful to you.  I know this is a lousy time for you but I ask you to please VOTE this Tuesday.  Take care.  :-)|`|71qGan9Raa	There is a reason he entered your life in the first place. I think he has fulfilled those purposes and now you can move on.

You need to get to know each other again.    |`|Lt8dL4MYaa	i think its a bit to late for what you want unless your into a open relationship. if so go get yourself a boy toy.|`|kzT8RvCqaa	only you'll know the answer to this queation.

Divorce him he doesnt deserve you.|`|OhLItaaqaa	What you need to do is not be with someone that's gonna cheat on you. After all once a cheater always a cheater. Trust me he will do it again im a guy and i would cheat its just something guys do |`|UUQpz0Iuaa	You've been through so much, your feelings are probally just worn out. My advice istake a break and see how things work out. Good luck!|`|bgtNYOp5aa	Why would you put up with a husband that is not faithful? Treats you like garbage?    Why don't you leave him, and he won't change.|`|URWtPDzXaa	if hes been cheating on you and you dont think youre in love with him anymore then i dont think hes worth it : /

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Congratulations! You are one of few and the proud. If more people were like you, the divorce rate wouldn't be so high. Sometimes, good wives  have bad husbands. Other times good husbands have bad wives. I always say that it takes two to make a relationship work. If you still feel that way then you and your husband are obviously doing the right thing.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	Because they dont have anyone to control|`|8fd15187072edd67714126b669a84db3aa	reality kicked in after the honey moon stage is over you see more difficulties and you loose interest in your partner|`|YUMqQZBzaa	A lot of couples (I think) stop trying to please each other once they get married. One or both partners stops doing the little things, and then the medium things... and things snowball from there. People get resentful and needy. Its easy to take each other for granted, and not make the time to stay close. I am in the same boat as you are - still in love, still blissful - and I credit it to making sure we appreciate each other and pay attention to each other - court each other, if you will. |`|ef65c78e9709f0599788307c5455c1d6aa	 The female thinks that she can change him once they get married, but no matter how much she tries, she can't. Then at some stage she realises that nothing she can do will help, So she works out a plan to get rid of him. This usually starts with cutting out the sex. I've got a headache etc. When this doesn't work, or makes it worse, She will stop doing things for him, hoping that he will leave her. That way she can get the House, car, furniture and all the money. And then start all over again  with another male.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	well i do not no what the women are like were u are from but most women i no adore there husband even when they have to work hard in there marriage and divorce is the last thing in most of are minds but it happens|`|AA11205208	Because they do not have a realistic view of how the world and marriage really works.    I still love my hubby, miss him when he is gone, and all that good stuff. We hold hands and kiss, snuggle, and generally act like we are dating most of the time. Our friends say it is hard to believe we have been married as long as we have because of how we act. We look about 15 years younger than we are, have younger friends, and are happy.    The wives of our friends want what we have and have asked me how we do it - stay this happy and in love. When I tell them that it comes from understanding, trust, and respect, as well as the fact that sex and time together are a priority their response is usually that they don't have time for that.    Kids, job, crazy schedules.... they all pull us in different directions. It sounds like you plan time together, the number one best thing you can do to keep yourself happy and your marriage good.    Try not to worry about bitter people and "when that happens". Just make your focus and keeping the status quo or bettering it.    I have been married more than three times as long as you and we are still very happy. Just keep doing what you are doing.
2SZowSXLaa	ahh, this question. it's a question with really no right or wrong answer. this is probably no help at all to you, but you just know. trust me on this one, you will know. you smile when you're with the person, you trust them with anything, they give you butterflies (but more than just in a hormonal way), you feel like you'd give up your life for there's.|`|AA10825876	I honestly don't know.

The. Hell.    You need to shut up... I'm serious, you're an as.s. Shut the f.uck up about those girls. You do have responsibilities. Like it or not, you're the FATHER. You have children to look after. And SIX GIRLS?! Why the hell did you not learn from your mistakes the fcuking first FIVE TIMES?! What is your PROBLEM?    Stop having unprotected sex. Stop having sex at all, you man-whore. It's both of your faults, but mostly YOURS. Next time (which there shouldn't be. Girls need to stay well away from you) use protection.    You miserable, pathetic, slutty piece of sh.it. I am so fcuking glad that MY dad isn't like you.|`|vdVkMDEYaa	Well whether you want to buy huggies  or not is out of the question if you are proven to be the father. It takes 2 to make a baby so it is also your fault!  Most of the time if you fail to provide DNA you will be the father by default, then you will be paying your babies mamas those checks every month for the next 18 years, don't think that you can just not pay it cuz you will go to jail.  Bottom line, you will be payin for that layin.    That and it is men like you that make my husband look bad.  He is a good dad, pays that check and spends time with his kids.  When you got kids the fun life is over!!  Get your act together and own up to your responsibilities!!!!!!  Get a job, hell since you got 6 kids you better get more than one job!  Maybe if you work 16 hour days instead of 8 hour days you won't have time to make more babies!!!!  OWN  UP TO YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES YOU JERK!!!!|`|IA8Eo1Xzaa	this is forward, but i just wanna say YOUR AN A SS!  it IS your fault because it was YOUR dick.  it takes a dick and a ***** to make a baby.

I heard some men said something quite similar, `That`s God`s Gifts.` They`re not responsible at all.  Not long, I learned another story. A young man promised her beautiful girl friend that he loved her and only her. This was just like a `Smoked Screen` instead he sneaked around and ruding other girls (including her girlfriend`s friends). One day, he was caught red handed doing those silly games. They had a big fight. The girl cut off the man`s BIG D...K and threw it away!

bIGIdlTKaa	You don't want gossipy first of all!  Charlie looks and sounds more genuine and seems to have a better personality and isn't only out for himself.  Besides, looks are not what make up a person, it is their personality that allows you to see their real beauty.  Haven't you ever experienced being totally in lust with someone and then realized that their actions actually made them less appealing?|`|AA10825876	I'm sorry to say this but Todd looks gay & Charlie's hot!

Who has a better personality? But other than that, I prefer Charlie.|`|SkfRWCiraa	"Charlie" is much cutter than "Todd" but from how you have described them i would go for "Todd"! A guy who socialy accempts himself, can exept you too. Plus it's not always about looks.  It's about who you really feel a connection with.  Good looks are just icing on the cake!|`|AA12302944	omg charlie is such a cutie! but i hope his hair isnt still that brown color cuz that black works a lot better for him...another vote for CHARLIE|`|AA10547925	I wouldn't mind if they are shy or low profile, if the girl is cute and she is nice to me then i don't care about confidence.

But all I have to say is that's pretty low of a guy to do.. how desperate can you get?|`|HU3usKTGaa	I haven't, but I've had it happen to friends of mine.  They actually did a news story on it where I live.  A male and female reporter went to a college party undercover and he pretended that he slipped her a roofie while she acted drugged.  He made a big show of telling people what he did and how he was going to take her upstairs, all the guys he told just cheered him on and all the women there just acted as though they didn't hear him.  It as actually really disturbing.  Of course this isn't how everyone would respond, but the fact that no one stepped in to stop him is just disgusting.|`|GeHxekEMaa	**** YES I HAVE AND THAT **** MADE ME FEEL SICK IT MADE MY HEART BEAT TIMES A MILLION TIMES I FEEL LIKE I WAS IN A TRANCE AND HAHAH THAT FAGET DIDNT GIVE ME ENOUGH I LEFT BEFORE THAT **** HIT ME IT DID THE NEXT MORNING I WAS THROWING UP SO MUCH AND THAT NITE WHEN I WENT HOME I COULDNT SLEEP IT THREW MY BODY OFF I WAS SSEEING BLURRY TO!

TDLyqejqaa	The first dress (black & gold) is sexier, but I like the second dress much more. To me, the plaid dress looks classier and the belt really makes you appear slender. I also like the bold red with muted colors. I have a few suggestions: (1) Play on the bold red with red finger and toe nail polish, and red glossy lipstick. (2) In order to appear a little more sexy, try a push-up bra and/or wear some sexy thigh-high stockings. Based on these pictures, he's a very lucky guy. Have fun on your date!|`|AA11681615	2|`|dAt0c2g3aa	2!|`|Vq5lbw5zaa	I think you should go for 2 cause you look pretty sexy in there.

YOU WILL LOOK FLAWLESS! AND YOUR A VERY PRETTY GIRL BY THE WAY!|`|KHsWu1zbaa	I'd go with 1 because it covers the shoulders. If you're going to a really nice restaurant as you said, it may be best to not show so much skin. So, first one, for sure. The second dress looks like you should be on a beach somewhere. Not classy restaurant material.
Na7NqZnMaa	You sound like a typical teen. Nothing wrong with you. Have fun!|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Being seriously in love with some one and flirting with them to get to know them are two different things.     Go with your gut and talk to the guy you like. See what happens.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Which is stronger? Your hope? or your fear? Close your eyes, take a deep breath and kiss him ;-) (practice often)|`|Ahd0Zuzlaa	Stop being afraid. Rejection doesn't mean anything.|`|raTZT7e0aa	haha i'd say just get some courage and ask'em! ya really don't have to much to lose :)|`|24biipOpaa	theres not something wrong with you you're just nervous. what you gotta think is that you'll never have the oppurtunity again so oh well if they rejected you at least you tried. just go for it and don't think about it and don't care if they say no because you can always find someone else later on. but if you dont take the risk now you'll never know.|`|QcZpWf44aa	yes you don't go around flirting with every guy you meet!|`|GpbwKmViaa	Don't be afraid of rejection. It is inevitable. But if neither of you make the first move, you both may think the other likes someone else or doesn't like them, and moves on. If you're afraid of losing friendship after getting rejected, make sure you tell them you value your friendship before telling them. That way, the awkwardness that usually occurs isn't as strong and is easier to die down.|`|AKdOlAq1aa	you should go with it. branch out. go out of your comfort zone... if he likes you, he'll want you to do that... not saying you have to kiss him first, but you should try to take things to the next level... take command! if you're nervous you'll trip on words, tell yourself that he wants to hear what you're talking about and he wants you to do well... he isn't talking and flirting with you for nothing or for a laugh... go for it and good luck! you got this!|`|TYBkDHYNaa	slow down  with the flirting and be yourself and try to start getting to know the one guy that you really like. Find out more about what you have in common, hobbies, music and hang out more all the best|`|nlb8jehBaa	If you really love him , then dont flirt with others|`|3xYAwxuhaa	There's nothing wrong with you.  Your a typical teen like me.    You really like him. If he's flirting back, rejection may not come up. I've been in your situation before. Wait a couple days longer. If he doesn't make a move then you make the move. If you get rejected, that's fine. You can always find someone else. I haven't found my true love, and have gotten rejected when I was in your position. Sure it may seem like you truly love them but, you never know...you may actually not. And if you DO truly love him you'd make the first move.    If this doesn't work I'm sorry :( I tried my best though ^ _ ^|`|c3j64eOqaa	If he is flirting with you, then I don't believe that rejection is going to be a problem.     You need to cool your jets, though. Flirting with everyone is going to make a dating relationship difficult because of cheating/jealousy.    It's okay to be social, outgoing and interactive, but try to make sure you're not being a tease...     If you continue to be afraid and let it stop you there, then nothing will happen. You have to HOPE and just reach out that he will not reject you.  If he rejects you, it's not the end of the world. Really. I know how terrible it feels to be rejected, but there are so, so, so many people out there who would be delighted to flirt with you and never muse the idea of rejecting you.    You want this to work and that's all you need.   Guys love it when girls are confident, too.   Go for it girl!     :D|`|4WC2TXlsaa	It is kind of nerve wracking making the first move because all of the flirting you guys are doing is kinda like a shield to protect you both. If you don't want to come right out and ask him out try the group thing first. Be like me and a couple girlfriends are going to a certain bar, movie, place, whatever and ask if he wants to go. See how the evening goes and then be like he there is a band playing or a movie I really want to see and just ask if he wants to go with you. If something happens and he does turn you down, then he wasn't right for you and find someone better. You won't get anywhere if you stand in the corner.|`|ZoozDB79aa	yes, just do him. youll have him in the palme of your hands, and if not, you can justr screw his friend to piss him off.|`|ch66f4w1aa	If he knows you flirt that much its unlikely he will take it seriously, you have to do something to show he is different.|`|suuQjkoOaa	suck it up and go for it.. life is full of rejection.. u need to be able to take it and move on.. if you hit good on  one in ten, you are ahead of the game|`|pd8kdcoaaa	don't make the first move... let him. Though give him hints. As for something wrong with you? I would say yes and welcome to the club!|`|xH5rcxuiaa	no- there is nothing wrong with you.  Find something that boosts your confidence a little, then ask. OR just think, if you do not- you might just lose him to somebody else.  :)  good luck.|`|Xblwqcfkaa	if you like him a lot, ask him to hang out with you sometime so that you can get to know each other a little more.  then maybe he will make the next move...|`|3VB1A1mOaa	this happens to me aswell i am a huge flirt  i do the same thing but wat i do is wait for him 2 make the 1st move ust keep flirting with him, ask him if wants 2 hang out or somting |`|SHtEu15maa	Well the guy isn't going to make the first move everytime you have to force yourself to do something because if this is what you're doing with one guy ur going to keep doing it over and over again DO SOMETHING if he rejects you oh well life goes on|`|qpnmXM3Uaa	Go for it. Maybe the reason he hasn't made a move yet is because he may be really into you and a little nervous. You got two options really: wait for him to make the move, which may not come, or do it yourself. Either way, the risk is the same. If you do get rejected, so what? At least you attempted.|`|8WwnJxIeaa	you seem like a fun person :), so keep flirting, if he rejects you then dont worry about it, there are plenty of other guys to flirt with|`|1IZacCIyaa	my advice is to take things slow. he doesn't expect a lot from you and he sounds like a nice guy.  don't screw it up. :D|`|saNDA07xaa	take a deep breath and count to five.  now lock yourself in your bedroom, turn up the britney spears, start screaming and cutting out pictures from Teen People and decoupage something.    i think it's past your bedtime.|`|FFEbLzIhaa	Are you flirting with me?  You are so hitting on me... but wait you pulled away... you must not be interested... darn... wait there is that flirt again.... ohhh I get it it!  You are a tease!  Well forget you lady...  I was all like... she is awesome and in to me.. but then you were all like... hot then cold...    Later...   good luck.  I am going back on the market!|`|Z76MXWsjaa	Guys are terrified of asking woman out. Just casually ask him out to go eat somewhere or to go catch a movie and casually move in from there...it's works about 95% of the time if you're not horribly disfigured or a *****.|`|2NYP2ctoaa	get to know the man a bit more and see where it leads to maybe after all he wont reject you after you loosen up and be yourself.he might like the real you that your hiding deep down from everybody..good luck...|`|ows0kjHGaa	NO guy rejects a girl!!! UNLESS this boys got a boyfriend.. You picckin up what im putting down? lol.. BELEIVE ME!!! no guy denies a girl.. if you mean in terms of kissing him or whatever.. if anything it way more of a turn on!! shows you want it.. and its not just him attacking you and you sit there and take it..

AA11558047	if ur in 8th grade...nah. if ur in high school...yep..
AA11558047	yeah, there is an asian girl who hangs out with the popular crowd. and it's me. shocking, eh? well, im popular cause im DIFFERENT. im weird and at my school...they LIKE weird. i don't really know how i became popular but i stopped hanging out with the popular crowd this year but im still popular.     i like black. im a tomboy. i hate light colors and most sports (like lacrosse and basketball). i hate dresses, skirts, and shirts that show off too much of your skin. i also hate it when people think "oh she's asian! she's a skank!" fyi, americans, the only skanks in the school are U.     the people in the popular crowd think im different from most girls. i only hang out with guys and i hate all the girls at the school. i have a really weird personality. i make a ton of people laugh. im not that pretty. im not even that skinny (well, 106 pounds. im 5'3). everyone likes me for me.     that's why im popular.    oh, btw, i hate boys.|`|0MZtzayDaa	yes. she was really pretty and really outgoing. she was very friendly to most people. i can't think of one person who didn't like her. all in all she was just a people's person and jokes a lot and she did well academically. she was humble and wasn't an arrogant snob. i had one class with her and she made the class really entertaining. i thought she was funny and pretty.|`|S55mhoSgaa	yes. i dont know why, i figure its because she was friends with the popular kids in training since they were small.|`|comuT2fkaa	Yes, there is is but i wouldn't consider  her being 100% asian.  she's filipino. & i don't know why she is popular  but yea i guess you can say she is.    i don't hang out with her.|`|HXr5k2eeaa	she has a most wonderful personality, Beautiful or lots of money!|`|GanzdHm5aa	yea but she moved but she was popular bcuz she was a good dancer, was a flirt, and she had a body|`|drNrPxHEaa	FUNNY! im 25 and half korean and i was the popular crew! i think it as nothing to do with her being asian i think it all about having the same personality!|`|v8SOZ3kWaa	Yeah their is. She is the sweetest thing ever so thats probably why shes 'popular' just be yourself if you want to fit in. :]|`|67kxGSslaa	pretty plus being popular is just about people likeing to hangout with u. at my school i guess im popular and one of my bffs is asian.... u guys r always beautiful!|`|M0qbL1n1aa	There is an Asian guy that I know and he is very popular and gets alone with everyone.  I have hung out with him one on one and he is a great guy.  Just be yourself.|`|h9PVbsUBaa	nooooo....  :/  theres no such thing as the "in" croud in SoCal.|`|v5QRWWQXaa	uh no not at mine but at my rival school there is|`|pvUai89Laa	nope, in my school, every one is cool ecept the asians and the white kids lol my school is ghetto here is the chart in coolness in my school   1 black  2 spanish aww yeah!   3 white   4 asian aww so sad|`|mF3PsJUVaa	i graduuated with one, she was very funny and got along with evryone.|`|3rDbLSZBaa	on my cheerleading squad there isnt any asian girls. or blacks either. we have blonde girls and brunettes and thats it|`|8K0PVgShaa	yes this asian (horrible girl, by the way) hangs out with the popular people, although people always are making bad comments about her, about how stupid she is, etc... and yeah she is very stupid, she'd tried to smoke, what a dumb and she is only 13 years old!!|`|9N6sW6KAaa	her looks her style how she dresses her character|`|TvuILSmYaa	I know, you're right! Almost all the Asian girls in my school hang out with all the popular kids! Well, I'm an Asian girl too, but I don't hang out with the popular kids, lol :D    I think most Asian girls hang out with the pops is because everybody nowadays (or at least in my school) thinks that Asians are cool, cute, or hot and they think they will be cool, cute, or hot if they hang out with her. Or those pops like her, lol
zdu3gh8jaa	I would tell him only once never to refer to me in that way again otherwise I'm gone, and if he does off I go. It would give him something to think about even if I did intend going back after a few hours or even the following day.   Hope this helps.|`|X4U36dHzaa	well his black himself so he better wake up to himself the fool,mate you don't have to put up with kind filth cause it will only lead to bigger problems for yourself and much worse,i think you should sit him down and be straight up with him an say i don't appreciate you when you call me that name,so if you don't cut it out i will leave you,there are alot of other people out there that treat me alot better!good luck don't take any of his petty S@ $!  stay strong!|`|468222527e64a99dd082e6dfccff34f9aa	Oooh - nasty guy. Dump him. Dont analyze him. He sounds nasty and controlling - get rid!|`|361f8be8c14edc074d91a2eaebcb5b15aa	I would say he is using racist language, but whether or not he is actually racist is a matter only he can judge at this time, though of course it is unlikely (but not impossible) as his girlfriend is black.  Casual terminology is one thing, regular abuse targeted in such a cynical way, and using such lazy logic, is another, and if I were you I would make it clear that if he did not alter his behaviour I would walk.|`|J1LPzr9Vaa	dat is wrong if he loves u he would never say dat,, he racist get rid of him: i dont think dats what u want 2 hear but u dont desrv a guy like him. do u seriously wana b wiv a guy who treats u like dat
dRWDV6Rlaa	if you have doubts about being with him  it might be that your not with the right guy  youll know right away whenn youre with the right you wont have doubst or ask questions, youll just know hes the right guy
f0c3aaf5a7d3986112803a80cfc7d0e6aa	even if its true your bf will just deny about it.. u really couldn't do anything unless u catch him cheating on you with ur own eyes, don't be so suspicious, ,just relax and trust him. or make a return call and ask his friend to prove it.     if he lets you check his phone that would be better, but don't dare to sneak and check his phone without his permission..     if he forgets bout u then just forget about him..|`|Fe2sw7rjaa	make him wear girls panties. that should stop the cheating pretty quick.|`|JuCdq3hoaa	Snoop around, maybe?  Cuss that message, it gives away a lot, yet it doesn't.  It could be a joke.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	you need to talk to your boyfriend about what his so called friend told you and go with your instincts on this instead of your heart
aI2V5xDGaa	Are you old enough to work and save to get it on your own? That is the best thing to do if so. If not I really have to tell you it is very bad if a computer runs your life that way.There is so much out there and so many people waste their lives on a pc.I like mine too but that is not life.|`|517722e044003718f8f92512815e4c2eaa	dont be so spoiled you runny nosed brat!!!|`|vj2pWs9Maa	There is so much more to life than being on the computer.  Honestly.  You might not think so, but in time you will.  I used to spend SOOO much time on the computer, chatting on MSN but then it got deleted off the computer.  I was a bit annoyed, but filled in my time doing other things.  Now the last thing I want to do when I get home from work is go anywhere near the computer!
2mlHf7Opaa	I'm not going to read all that.    How do you tell if someone likes you?  YOU ASK THEM.  How hard is it to figure that out?|`|EVtLlSEwaa	Sometimes, I know this is hard to believe, guy just want to be friends. It is rare, but there are guys that like having girls as friends. Maybe, he didn't care about the whole thing because he is just a laid back guy that doesn't get into gossip and crap like that. But whatever his deal is you shouldn't get too far into anything if he is still with his gf. No matter what. It isn't right, even if she is a slut, and he could just use the fact that you like him to get something from you and stay with his gf.|`|bG8mEUHhaa	jus ask him. n if he lkes you there you go a bf for you. dnt be shy nor nervous, have sum faith in you u will be fine.|`|NxXnHwnhaa	i don't get it.. but you shouldn't interfere with a guy who already has a girlfriend. if he likes you then he will let u no. if not leave him alone|`|4VtaQHLCaa	Yes i think that means he likes you ;) If he came and sat by you then he deffinately doesn't hate you, most guys would just ignore it or hide lol. So maybe txt him or msn him or something and ask if he is still going out with his gf, then say oh like your disappointed. Then see what happens ;) maybe even ask him if he would like you if he wasn't going out with her.. I Say Go For It!!!|`|YikwBBSfaa	well girl, i hate to say this but you should give it a shot, just know that the answer can be anything.... do it though, it wont hurt to find out. If he rejects you just move on|`|DBbbupJJaa	when guys know you like them they tend to flirt with you because they think you will be easy to get. so, i don't really think he likes you unless he tells you that he does and he really means it. what you should do? just chill. don't be too obvious that you like him. ayt?
bD4mltz9aa	Hello  8 months is quite a long relationship =) and people eventually start to question their feelings (it is natural and perfectly normal) once it's been a long time with them. "Does she love me.. Do I love her? Is she trying? Am I trying..?" etc etc  Because you don't know what has gone wrong, I have no way of knowing =) BUT~ I have had the same problem.. It didn't feel right when i was with him.. I got sick of him calling me every 10 minutes of the day.. I'd feel the back of my throat burn up constantly when I was with him...  I use to pretend I was out with friends when i wasn't.. I figured that I was sick of him, and needed space.  When I was in your position, I took one of those "breaks" to realize how I get along without my BF in my life, and you know what? It fixed everything, it made me realize how much I needed him :)  I would try talking to her tho =P ask her how she feels, and if she is okay with everything.   Or maybe you need to spice up your relationship with her? Or she could be giving you subliminal signs.. which is why you don't know what has gone wrong.  ... or even try to force yourself to spend a full day with her, kissing, talking, spending every moment with her, and make sure it is really fun.  Sometimes feelings just go, and never come back.. 'cause people change.. but don't get your hopes down =) it could only be something small =D    Good luck, and I hope you're love-sick-knots in your tummy get better soon >=O
JHdFwKY4aa	Well one thing to do is to not bring it up constantly.  Just take things slow and steady with him.  You should be already, but if not okay.  Try not to be only his girl friend, but his best friend.  Knowing that he can come to you as a friend is one of the best feelings.  Those are just things that you already know, but it is just a reminder to you.    Also let him be closer to his dad if he is a good dad to be around.  His dad can comfort on this too.  And ask his father about his mom if you don't know much.  You'll do fine I'm sure, but just see how much he still misses his mom.  He's still young, so talk him through some depressions he may go through.  Just be there for him is the best advice, lol.|`|H86W4AuOaa	just love him...when you hug or kiss him do it with extra emotion
O1lm79EFaa	well, take it as a compliment! cause your haters are always your biggest fans!|`|2tn8EALqaa	You obviously don't know what a hater is then.  That's like asking if people smile because they're happy|`|fna0OfuCaa	I think it depends, I don't like some girls for certain reasons, but its def not because I am jealous of them. I guess it depends on what you look like or have that other girls would be jealous of....|`|wKo5P7ueaa	jealousy is one of the deadly sins...    lol. funny right?|`|3mHQQeLNaa	well not all the time mayb they just think u hate them back..|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	yeah chicks h8 other chiks when theyr jelly    infact, if i were a chick id h8 u cuz ur avatar is HOT|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Right definition will be the competition and some women's don't like that and they institute the feelings of jealousy instead and other out comings are already history.|`|1KajpBdaaa	idk maybe cause they wish they were as good as u in getting guys?|`|wCXY3MJ2aa	you are right!|`|ddWyRjmVaa	ugh! same freaking problem!!!  some girls HATE me, and i didn't even do anything. and i would say i was pretty and get almost any guy.  but still!! like seriously! why u haten?|`|YfUBxwDUaa	yeah they can.  i used to but now im over that and hating is really gay and overrated. spread thah love!|`|7975768afc30ab732d41bba7e2ea3a52aa	Have you tried smiling?, waving hello? Being friendly?|`|JurXNltPaa	YES YES YES YES YES YES!!! LOL......yes they will hate....I go through the same thing!! Tell them to get a life and stop wishing they was in urs!! Good Luck girl!!|`|2hhGgKBZaa	That is possibly why they are being rude to you. Are you sure you've done nothing to offend them? Some girls are just bitches whether you're beautiful or ugly.     Forget about them, does it even really matter if they are jealous or not? Don't rate yourself on other people's views!|`|YNKyEk4faa	yea...i mean why else would they pay attention to a person they dont like....just ignore them.|`|CG1xqPEsaa	haha same thing happens with me.  and yes..or they just dont like you.it goes either way.   but mostly because there jealous.|`|KH5zRKWFaa	It's the same for me! Don't worry about it! Just ignore them. They have nothing better to do than hate onother girls.lol.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Most likely, I find it to be very immature an over dramatic really and that's why most of my friends are male.  Just remember this " Love me or hate me either way your still thinking about me"

ohi0kM6Raa	dude, i hear your complaint.  but it depends on the girl.  generally, if you haven't let too much time pass, she's probably into you since she likes being around you.  that means you gotta step up to the plate and take a swing.  however, once again depending on the girl, these windows can be small and then bam - friend zone.  and nobody wants that.    here's an easy one.  lay out a lame joke and see if she laughs.  if she does, you're in.  if she busts your jops, you gotta gauge how much fun she had doin it.      but either way dude, i'd say f*ck it and go for it.|`|mvaPdekPaa	um if ur holding hands, txting or yall talk often or go to places together then yall are pretty much dating. if u want to be dating bc u arent right now then ask her to a party or to a movie!! ur in college for goodness sakes!|`|6FoESYWRaa	Well this is not something you want to judge by actions. If your interested in her then you ask her how she feels about you. Ask her If she thinks there could ever be more than friendship between you two and then go from there. Its not hard, just need to communicate with her. No need to be shy about it if she wants you she does if she doesn't move on to the next.|`|e207987deddf27dc04449727b6aaafc4aa	Just ask!  All she can say is no......i got that advice from a friend many years ago, worked for me!|`|7IyeOp0xaa	if she tells you who she thinks is cute/hot or w/e ,your stuck in the frend zone,if she like hints ,smiles gestures,w/e then she's totally into you

c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	You would truly make matters worst by running away. If your mom is bipolar, then she needs you more than ever. It seems like you understand some things about mental illness, and if it true, she needs your support and patients.     You are a young adult teen. Every parents has their own way of disciplining their kids, some over do it. It doesn't mean that she is bipolar. My advice is to write a kind note and express how you feel and mostly request for her as a parent to understand your true feelings.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Do not run away it is too dangerous out there,talk to your mom and if she will not listen talk to a councilor|`|gxZqRdRiaa	well my step dad is bipolar  and usually the bipolar disorder  has the main effect of give people mood swings   your case could be bipolar or it could just be some sort of different anger issue...my step dad takes medication..idk how u could convince her but maybe a psychiatrist or a doctor could help her...try catching her in a good mood and telling her that it really effects you   or you could get in advance touch with a doctor       im not sure if i helped but i tried|`|u5F22mEbaa	sounds to me like she's just had it - if you push someone too far, they go as far as they can in the opposite direction.  You won't get far on your own and she is doing a tough job, raising you by herself.  Tired and worried moms overreact - try and follow the rules...you can't take away her authority over your life right now - she will give it to you when she trusts you.|`|Iq0ZQaXraa	lemme tell ya oone thing,.....meta pause

uqWdNf3Faa	honestly. you are worried because valentine's day is soon? that holiday is overrated. just treat it like any other day.  just give her some space. there should still be loads of time before prom so there's a chance you can still go with her. if she doesnt like you as more of a friend then dont push it. things could get really creepy, really fast.|`|JmMrgtGqaa	as for valantines day theres not much you can do but ride it out as a single. But with your friend, wait till they break up, but dont push her to it until your sure its going to happen. If it looks like its gonna be a long term relationshio, wait, wait to strike. Its hard but it can happen. It did to me after my best friend got over a 3 year relationship that i liked her the whole time. But dont be the one to try to break them up, or at least appear to be!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You are 15, get over it|`|ZnJ2Y5cAaa	Dude if she has a boyfriend you cant be a total dousche and take her away from him thats one thing definately not to do, you should try to find someone else to ask out cause theres alot of more girls out there so just move on|`|kZiPBJiJaa	OMG dude no joke I am in the same situation as u but she has no girlfriend. But dude just wade it out and shell be urs|`|Sbid3vugaa	just keep talking to lots of girls and maybe get some more 1 on 1 time with them. maybe none of them has seen you as the boyfriend type yet. and always hang in there, because some girl will or already is crushing on you too :)|`|zMuVq63Laa	hi... i feel bad for you! i think you should talk to her about it and tell her that you were looking forward to going to the prom with her... how far away is prom? do you think that she will still have this boyfriend by that time? i think because valentines day is coming up, you should buy her a rose or something and she will be so flattered!!  i know i would be :) people tend to see desperation, so maybe if you don't seem too keen on having a girlfriend, it may actually happen... good luck buddy!!
lIoDmnvEaa	Noooooooooooo.
fzIeGPZYaa	you cant have a relationship based on who you WANT someone to be, or on who they USED to be. I know its hard to do but dont just sit around and hope "he will come around" because then you will look for every excuse to think he IS coming around and you will be in for a LOT of dissapointments|`|wE89mPZ3aa	I do not think you were wrong.  When someone has a drug problem they are hard to deal with and he needs to get some help for it. He is young and he is a pothead so you need to think about what is best for you.  If he keeps smoking pot then you will always have a problem.|`|3gzEcBpyaa	honestly dont go back to him i'm pretty sure u can find a way better guy then that..or try to change him like make him a better person just talk to him of how u really feel on what he does|`|nvsVXlBlaa	no you should stand up for your self|`|7foornMVaa	You are making him choose between you and weed.  Sounds like the weed is gonna win.  You should set your standards a little higher and find a man that will make an effort to be your bf.  Why would you waste your time on someone that doesnt come and see you?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It may be true, but that doesn't mean he'll come running back.    As far as I can tell, you wanted more attention than he was able to provide. So you got all pissy with him and when he didn't start paying attention to you (as he never promised he would) you thought it would be a good time to tell him off.  And he STILL  isn't paying you any attention!  So... to fuel your anger a bit more, you decided to say nasty things about him in a public forum, hoping that everyone will agree with you.    The problem with your strategy is that he's still just who he is and you're still trying to get him to "see your point".  He's seen it.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	He'll come back around.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I think if he hasn't came around and wasn't coming around before he had someone else on the side. you should leave him alone and find better.
8nexYdUjaa	aww, i think interracial relationships are beautiful =)  don't give up on this if you really like eachother !  don't let anyone tell you you two shouldn't be together,  try to get in contact with him if you don't have any contact.  maybe ask people around school if they know him or if they have his number, you'll definetly find people that can give you some information.  good luck, i hope everything works out for you =)|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Now the feelings is right wait until you're older and if things are still same why not go for it until then play low so as you re not trapped with locked feelings in the future and feel sorry for the whole relationship.Its the resistance of culture difference and way of believe from the past that's holding many from coming to a better tie.|`|CZdFWit7aa	if u like him then date him. he's not datin your family. but if you cant handle it then leave him alone.|`|2tn8EALqaa	wow way to stereotype old white people. Not all of them are white supremacists ya know  and way to stereotype white teen girls!   Maybe you should just leave the guy alone|`|2FhPfxnsaa	How far did he move? That might be a bigger problem then race.|`|9Z48RhlKaa	The age of blacks and white not equal is long over.  Interracial relationships are the same as whites and whites and blacks and blacks.  I honestly do not see what the big deal is. More pigment in blacks. Big deal.    I dont understand your question!!!!|`|0V2UrTqoaa	I think it's nice how you dont care what race he is, you just like him for him, dont listen to you parents unless they have a lagit reason other than the fact that he's black. If they say something like IDK he's in a gan (or something steriotypical) then just say you wont believe it unless they give you proof, interracial couples arent uncommon now, I know several people who are half black and half white, even half indian half black!(seriously)
bD4mltz9aa	Awe that's cute =)  She probably wants to talk to you, but is too shy =) and is expecting you to talk to her?  Or maybe you're just pretty to look at =D  Shy girls generally start to get to know guys over the internet (myspace in your situation) before they puck up the courage to get to know them in person =P  It could be a slight crush as well =)  OR you could look funny =O or wear a funny hat and she can't stop staring at it? idk :)    Those are merely some possibilities =) You know her better than I do 
zzaScg0haa	Just give it time, spending more time with your friends and family
EUiHnphOaa	actually this is quite funny. I am having the same problem. Last week, i went up to her brought her to the side of the hallway, and kissed her. Then i found that she liked me secretly. She broke up with her bf now she is with me.    For you i would say just have a nice talk. or be like "what if someone close to you liked you?" she says who? Then you say "Me"    Make sure you think she isn't gunna be sad or unhappy with you saying that. I think you have a good chance. believe me my gf is way out a my league.|`|dgBJ74S8aa	Sometimes things need to stay where they are. Sometimes you need to advance. It's up to you, and if you really love her you will think not of just how it will feel with her knowing, but how it will affect her. You might lose your best friend. You might start dating. Or you might just remain friends. Just do what feels right. If shes really your friend, she will still continue your friendship whether the feels the same or not.|`|op4gBJRJaa	Yes obviously you should tell her, Thinking about her won't get you anywhere, since they are having problems which means they're getting sick of each other so the sooner you tell her the more she'll get him out of his head so then she's all yours    Make sure you tell her how long you've liked her and how jealous of her old boyfriend you were, so then she'll think "Awww thats so cute" mind be kinda gay but usually thats a good sign when girls do that :)    Good luck|`|mvaPdekPaa	tell her bc life is too short for her to go thru a couple other guys if u really want her tht bad. plus yall are best friends so chances are it probably will end up working out. when she breaks up with her bf now jump in there before anyone else can. good luck|`|ma2SXrVfaa	be brave. just tell her and hope for the best. Besides if there are other people they may get there before you do. so you don't want to take a chance. also if you're her best friend you should already know her more than most people. and as for the bf... if they are having problems it would be best now then later in case things take a turn for the better|`|Bc3WOgUYaa	ALWAYS tell a girl how u feel. dont hide it just let her know how you fell!!!!        TAKE IT FROM ME I AM A GIRL|`|YNssCMkfaa	STICK TO THE GAME PLAN !. Be a man! not to be rude. you have to get out there. beat them to her. if you have been hanging around her for long time go for it. she probably knows enough about you already. if you don't do it, it wont magically happen itself. Life is not like the movies man!. Get Out There. Live Your Life. Enjoy Being YOUNG!.                                                                                                                                                        Ps. i am young too. probably more than you.LOL|`|fwdJLU91aa	well it sounds like since they're having trouble with their relationship it'll end soon.. wait til then, then tell her how you feel... dont let the other guys get to her first lol|`|yrtlMEKgaa	1. Encourage her to break up with him  2. Wait for her to realize she didn't want to  3. Convince him not to take her back  4. Console her when she's weak  5. ???  6. PROFIT|`|FvBpBR1faa	You'll never know what will happen until you tell her. She might be happy if you tell her or she might not feel the same. It hard to let some else know you like them in these situations. If you do it you would feel better and then you wouldn't be wondering what she would do or say. Do what ever feels right....|`|sOTRfeRUaa	yu shoud let her kno. you should of let her kno long before. Tell her, before another guy does. And if you think they will be as nice and wait til her and her boyfriend are dne.. fine, you keep that faith buddy.|`|PtyFBR4Raa	Hey bro,you should wait until they break out,then let her know what do you feel for her.They may have some problems but do not stick on that.Nobody is perfect you know,they may come back later on.Or when you talk to her make up a conversation about a girl that you fall in love with and describe the situation.You will see what her reaction is then you will have an idea about how to start.
080fc8127b6092aa4412612b02ecfbdbaa	It's very simple.  Yes.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  You knew you were the type of person who fears being alone.  Grow up and tell him.  You should have told him before he left.  You already knew it would happen.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	yeah|`|fwdJLU91aa	i wont say you're a bad person because i dont know you,   but you have DEFINATELY put yourself in a bad situation and you're setting yourself up to get hurt and probley experience some heart ache.    good luck though|`|yrtlMEKgaa	Yes.|`|lCAXR4Xpaa	yes. you're hurting someone you love. i dont know how many things are wrong with this situation. be honest. grow balls and break up with your boyfriend if you must. you cant be with two guys at once. youre being selfish by putting your interests above others.
PXC2ae19aa	Well...unfortunately not everyone who is "Hot" will appreciate the beauty in ones spirit or find beauty in the small things. Is she a sweet girl? Is she classy? Your opinion on someone should never be based off of another persons opinion. If we all liked the same things and never saw through the eyes of the heart...we'd have a lot of lonely people. If you like the girl...Then LIKE her! Don't feel pressured by what your friends say...after all...your friends don't determine your happiness...YOU DO!    Good Luck!|`|d68IGhgHaa	i think a picture would help because people tend to have bad taste|`|BWttPY1taa	i seems chances for you are pretty slim and I don't think this girl is ugly|`|AA10420187	Looks is not what makes a person!!|`|db4b570a45aa90c27a2f308183e6dc0baa	ugly is an opinion. everyone can beautiful.|`|VMAhim63aa	there is absolutely no way for anyone to know that by reading this
1Qeg0CQ2aa	DUDE!  You are so young.  Even if you talked about a future together.  That's a LONG time.  I got married at 27.  Best decision I made.  You really can't get a grasp on who you are going to be in life until you are at least 25.  You'll get over her.  Just put up with her in your classes.  And after all that is over, just make sure to stay away from her.  If it's been over a year, it's over.  You may feel like she's "the one."  But just be patient.  You have college.  After you turn 21 you can go to bars and that opens up a whole other world of crazy meetings up with girls.  Just be strong and move on.  The right girl will come along some day.|`|kZ296wkraa	She may be your first love but the reason you'll never get over her is because your relationship was cut short. You broke up and that was that. If you would have stayed together that would be great but you are left playing the "what if?' game. i will always wonder what me and my first love would be doing now, would we have had kids, a new home etc. If you  would have stayed longer you would have had a longer history. Concentrate on the now. If you want, ask her out for coffee to talk about old times. I bet the mystique wont be there like you think it will. You need some sort of closure.|`|AA10025824	Same kind of situation, and I forgot what she looked like once I found someone else.|`|4VrKKOwnaa	nope, i still love ribs and beer|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Yes, you will totally get over her.  It just takes a little more time.  Trust me.|`|c70bd8e9382a0b8103fa10cfdb754ebdaa	yes you will find another love. The only way is time . That is what it takes trust from experience. And you will always remember your first love. I know I do.|`|gUy60Efhaa	You WILL get over your 1st love.  Many of my guy.friends have also.  Theres many fish in the sea!  Sounds like you need to just move on and forget all the silly drama.  You deserve better.  If its meant to be, she'll come running after you once she sees you are a challenge once again. Just do it!!!|`|91c6bKdwaa	I was in the same situation. To this day i'm still not sure if i'm over him. It has been a little over a year. We were dating for about 3 years and then he moved. We were very serious as well and he was my first love. I always knew there was something special about him and between us. Then everything basicaly had to end when  he moved. I have tried dating other people but when i do it just makes me think of him. we have fought and been on little breaks and recently i just found out he cheated on me over the last summer we were together. No matter how mean he was or talked about me i always loved him. like if we were in fights he was mean. not always or anything. but i just couldn't stop thinking about him or loving him. Once i found out he cheated on me by having SEX with some nasty girl it just made me extremely mad. With my luck i'll probably forgive him and just keep wanting him back. I hope not. Sorry If i'm just going on and on but this kinda relates to your story. okay, so how i was saying it has become easier for me... I recently started dating this guy. and I'm starting to feel the way I started to feel when i first started dating my "first Love". So i'm hoping i fall inlove with this my bf. now. It does take time and you will get over her. I hope this helps you and good luck!! :]|`|Z23xZ7wmaa	It's absolutely possible to get over your first love. My first love and I had a huge falling out, but now we have a great, platonic relationship. He's my best friend.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	find a way to tell her just to get it off your chest. but moving on is the best thing to do at this point.|`|K4f9QQj4aa	i am still in love with my first even though she has another b.f but when u find someone else u get over it|`|qcB23QvZaa	i was in that situation i know how you feel dude =[  so the guy i loved i met on vacation and spent like 2 weeks with him and then he had to leave because we live in different states    i cried for like weeks. but it actually never really does go away. I haven't had a boyfriend since and everytime i start to like someone or think about going out with someone i think about him    i would seriously recommend working things out with her.    it sounds like you guys were cute and meant to be. Try getting someone else to bring it up if she won't talk to you..    yeah time really doesn't help, i'm really sorry about ur situation|`|oqO6ff4caa	it took me about a year or so but i did get over it|`|I0g24Jmkaa	If people break up over a reason that was misunderstood and can't be fixed, it's always tough to get them back.|`|w1RPYXoiaa	You'll get over it eventually, but you'll never forget your first love.  Finding a new girlfriend that really appreciates you and whom you will be compatible with will make it easier.  Perhaps you'll even fall in love again..|`|Hbxsq22daa	when you let someone into your heart, they stay there forever.really    if were you i would do anything to get her back and let her know the truth, make her listen.    I'm saying this because i'm madly in love with my ex and i would do anything to get him back, and it would mean the world to me if he came back and at least talk to me|`|30nzrpnCaa	you're still in high school. you'll get over here when you're older.|`|RvOH0hjhaa	when you find someone you get along with better and treats you the way youve always wanted to be treated, youll forget anyone else ever existed|`|HUUZgDppaa	you will get over her once you get another girlfriend trust me|`|WQOC6ILMaa	It takes a while but you get over it. It just takes time. The best way to get over it quicker is to focus on your hobbies. If your old hobbies don't interest you anymore find some new ones. The new ones you might not enjoy so much at first, but just keep doing them and you will. Best of luck its tough, but this is one of those wounds time can fix. I feel for you man on this one you just got to tough it out. Hope things start looking up real soon.|`|NkqslVrtaa	You get "over " it as  he pain is not as fresh but they will ALWAYS have adear place inyour heart with fond and difficult memories.  There can only be ONE first love so that should give some insight!|`|8Gm9dKOiaa	are u still dating another girl?|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	Yes you will eventually get over it.  Seeing her almost everyday doesnt help getting over her but once you get out of highschool it will be easier.  Every relationship and break up are different and each one takes a different amount of time to get over.  It only took me 2 weeks to get over one of my exes who i had been friends with for over 10 years before we fell in love only to have her cheat on me.  When me and my fiance split almost 9 months ago it took months for me to get over her and everyonce in a while i still feel it.
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	You talk about anything you know you have in common already.  Or you ask questions that will discover what you may have in common.    Most girls enjoy talking about friends, outings, boys, clothes, celebrities, television shows, movies, makeup & fashion, school, classes, hobbies, family, their MySpace or FaceBook etc.   Basically, anyhting to do with themselves.
QEqGukjZaa	how about you just tell him...and stop beating around the bush..lol<br>  <br>  be real.|`|b297669a7b7958048f4b9112d9395439aa	1. dress up like a ninja and stalk him<br>  2. lick their food before they eat it<br>  3. bake food for them<br>  4. sing a really bad but funny song<br>  5. fill their car with ping pong balls<br>  6. fall on him<br>  <br>  the baking part is probably the most normal one :]
kE2CuYP3aa	Talk to her. Make her laugh. If she tends to be followed around by a bunch of wannabes ask to talk to her alone and maybe just walk or something get to no her and make sure u like her before u start flirting.One of my friends flirted so much this guy asked her out when they were dating she realized she didn't like him and broke his heart:-( But if u play sports ask her to come to 1 of ur games.DON'T BE SHY!!!! Tell her how pretty she looks or hot whichever u perfer.maybe sit next to her after the game and make a move or something.GOOD LUCK :-)|`|91c6bKdwaa	well your a little young i guess. but just do what you think you should do. someone shouldn't tell you how to flirt just go for it and talk to her or something.
OOptQPnFaa	what i have heard is every night when u go to sleep someone is thinking about you and when you look at the moon some1 else is looking up there too. so yes i do think that and yes i think bout my crush every night *sigh*   ur not stupid for believing in this i do too. it's a lil something called faith, some1 is out there for everyone. u just have to open up ur eyes and look around and what you have and what soon is to come.   nothing is impossible.|`|yiQwERHPaa	everyone is always being thought of erysingle day, whether it be family or friends, or even strangers!

Everyone thinks about this.|`|1kZenfZzaa	Darn it, tonight I will probably be thinking of you (of course not crushing on you), instead of falling to sleep...gee, thanks a lot.|`|euOtDB3Baa	We're human...we've all had those thoughts.  When you're lying there tonight, listen to "Gotta Be Somebody" by Nickelback.  Or if not that then some good music for mending heartbreak.  Someone is probably writing this very same question in a journal or texting it to a reliable friend right now, so yeah, we hear ya.  Keep thinking...and dreaming of that person.  Dream on, girl.|`|29fDip0Eaa	YES!|`|TXrSZkB9aa	im think  we are all hoping someone is thinking of us as they fall to sleep|`|ZNKchhXSaa	I think about extraterrestrials and Soviet satellites before I go to bed.    Sometimes it's so intense I have to do the dirty thing.|`|qI7T8jFeaa	yes I think we all have wondered  this sometime is our lives. and i am sure this is normal for all to do. also i do believe there is always someone out there thinking of us as we are of them. Just remember there is always someone for everyone out there .. keep dreaming and you will find them.,|`|e0c2ec01b5f406ac6dfa1a34259ce8ebaa	Sure! Someone is thinking of you before they sleep. You thought nobody has a crush on you? You'll never know until they tell you. I thought no body will have a crush on me, but someone told by somebody did have. Well your not sure if you won't ask either.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Yeah sure, before I go to sleep and first thing when I wake up and whatever I'm doing for the rest of the day.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I think all the time.  Sometimes, it hurts a bit but after a while, you get used to the pain and start thinking of bigger things.|`|L38M9lrLaa	yea im sure someone is..might be good might be bad..but someone is|`|WhlwZeiXaa	of course people are thinking about you.  i guarantee you've been in someones dreams before (in a good or bad way i dont know :P).|`|7vfBu0x2aa	yep yep i with there was a way to tell :]|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	That is very normal, you made me smile with this question, cuz it reminded me of myself at young age.I would actually, imagine conversations and situations in my mind haha. Of course somebody is thinking of you, definetly, now who that is i dont know, let us know when you find out ;) Sweet dreams :)|`|3m4YrL8qaa	i think that every day!  haha and i hope so|`|AOBEkqzXaa	uh no, you're not stupid...you're normal and have hormones, emotions, and feelings to produce those thoughts    I think about my husband all the time :)|`|FPT6pstraa	No, but when I sleep I dream of panda bears and sponge cake.|`|nxBkPPu7aa	Yes, its funny but even for a guy i know that ugly women like me and think im hot and ill never touch them even though im not that great looking|`|WjSJBWl7aa	It's a guilty pleasure to imagine someone likes us. :)|`|LidOp3QQaa	i have no idea sorry. i don't really know you though|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Haha hellz yeah girl I think we all have, I can't help it..and I even start thinking what we would be doing now if they were with me at the moment. Not dirty things! ahaha..just what we would be talking about and stuff. I ain't gonna lie, I even picture in my head how it would be like if they were with me at the moment...Then I just keep thinking about her till I fall asleep and when I woke up I keep wondering what my last thought about em was, but I cant remember! haha..but yeah i've been there :)|`|MtlkMecnaa	Ive never really thought about that before. Your not stupid :)|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	maybe most crushes are out of sheer shallowness. so look in the mirror and ask yourself if your hot|`|UCKAiLN1aa	I know what you mean! I am always thinking about people in my life I wonder if anyone thinks meaningfully of me. I am sure someone is thinking about you, statistically it is definitely likely. :)|`|eMFwMQGHaa	I would think so. You seem like a realist, and a hilarious person!|`|liKGZCEDaa	well probably people think too much|`|xri2lFpKaa	eveyr nite!@!! haha i think of it too soooo normal u wouldnt be normal if u didnt think about ur crush!@!!!! haha|`|RyApVLzQaa	No your not stupid for thinking about this.  I've thought about it my own self from time to time lol.  Its natural so don't worry about it. :)|`|kWIqDkB9aa	I think that all the fckuing time!!! But i kinda know the guys thinking it too :) soooo its all good!|`|VMAhim63aa	ill think about you tonight
V59AiHpjaa	aww you re so adorable ( thats not a bad thing!). my bf is the same way and was exactly like you at your age. i was the ONLY girl he talked to. he liked me for 4 years before he asked me out when i was 16. he's still deathly shy  and after bragging about having all these gf's and **** when he was that age he later told me that i was the first girl he ever kissed and the first girl he ever loved and that he was a virgin before he met me lol . now we're getting married over the summer and he is my best friend in the whole world and i love him to death. e went from being shy to now i have to tell him the shut the hell up lol. so don't worry you'll have your time and place. i know guys who rushe into relationships young and now those girls have ditched them or they are stuck in a REALLY controlling relationship where they had to change their whole personality for the girl to like them. so please don't do that im sure you are perfect the way you are. girls are stupid and silly things, trust me i am one. and don't think you arent good enough or that you are ugly. 1) girls really don't care what you look like, we look at how you act and how you can be a good bf and possible husband.  2)your YOUNG ( im only 19 but your youngcompared to what you'll feel like when you are my age) so dont stress about your looks my bf used to be really short and pudgy. he didn't hit puberty until he was 17 lol. now he's 6 foot and deathly skinny and his pudge turned into lots of sexy.    please don't stress and let love come to you. if you chase love it will ALWAYS out run you. good luck!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Relax. Many people don't have relationships/kiss until college or later. Don't push yourself to get a girlfriend just because you feel like everyone else has one or it'll end up being a terrible relationship.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Rejection is a part of life for both guys and girls.  You better get used to it because I promise you'll be rejected again either by women or for a job you want or college or whatever.  I've noticed that the problem with short guys is that girls like to feel 'smaller' than the guy they're with.  That's hard if you're shorter than all the girls.  But I've also known short guys who go to the gym and get built, and they don't seem so small anymore.  They tend to get girls even if the girls are taller than them because they're bigger and weigh more and all that.  You might want to focus on working out.  At 15, you can start to put on muscle definition and fill out.  By the time you're 18, if you don't grow much, you'll still have a kick a,, body and girls will be into it.|`|Yv5RYcmvaa	I am almost 100% in the same situation. What I do (and I have not really had TOO much success so far) is be myself and act like I have no worries. Talk and be strong. Not sure if this is what you are looking for, but I can definitely relate. Don't let it all get to your head yet, we are still young.|`|hKbvlyBoaa	Don't worry. It will happen some day. Enjoy the friends you have and be confident in who you are.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	if you're doing it only because everyone else, chill. you dont have to be like them. dont be afraid of rejection and take it easy. love will find your way. it always does....good luck!!|`|1QGRIyaVaa	it's normal to have never had a girlfriend or first kiss!! just let time do its job and go with the flow!!  Rejection hurts...but it can only make you stronger!! be more out there...start talking to some girls.  before you know it...you will be invited to things...and maybe even get your first gf or kiss!! good luck!! =]
9g5DFbryaa	What do you mean by what you have? If what you are referring to is sex, then you need to wait. I thought all the guys I dated were assholes and I thought they only wanted me for sex. But then I really thought about it and it takes two to tango. So I tried waiting a while before having sex with a guy. And it worked out for the best. Maybe you are not letting these girls get to know you for who you are. Forget gender, if you sleep with someone right away, they're not going to take you seriously. Even waiting a month would make a difference.   If you are referring to money, you need to keep that to yourself until you can trust the girl. Instead of trying to impress her with a really fancy restaurant, take her to a more casual one. Go to the movies. Go on dates that every day people do. And try not to let her see your place for a while.|`|AA10791200	easy answer= treat them for what they are, if you enjoy them (phisycally) even better, if you don't let them know.|`|2KPq7Ewnaa	uh... pretend u r broke...tell her out right, if she  is gonna screw u over, then get lost,
A8F4HF3Paa	Because they tend to be fit, and have a lot of confidence, and are aggressive in sports, and competitive, and can do something (usually) that the girls can't physically do as well and some girls find the combination of all that impressive.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	It's called evolution. Strong masculine athletic males were able to go out and get food for the family. Thus they make the best fathers.|`|Mv986L0uaa	Like them? Like them?  Well, some girls think they're hot...

I've had many of my friends interested in jocks because they were athletic and interested in doing sports that she may also like.  So they connected in a way. :/|`|9z9BW10daa	I don't.  I mean, all the jocks at my school are arrogant, moronic, self-absorbed b*stards, I don't know about yours..|`|4GJmZSKAaa	well honestly, not all women like jocks.  i know plently that like geeks or scenes or whatever.    it's just a personal preference     i like all kinds of guys, but i guess i'd like jocks because i'm a sporty girl so that would be a kind of thing that would attract me.    i like geeks because i'm a major geek inside, like i have a reason for everything.   doesn't really matter on the "type" of guy, just preference|`|mJAvkGjtaa	i dont    oh....you are American and you mean jock as in the stereotype not the sport    and while reading all of the answers above me, i can really tell that America has REALLY built up that stereotype.     so what if you dress/act/talk like a geek AND a jock, huh? what 'CATEGORY' do they fit into?!?!    gosh you need to learn how to treat everyone as equal if you want to work as a whole society and stop being so judgmental|`|jggRn9YVaa	It brakes the ice makes conversation and it is a way of warming up|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	They usually have confidence.|`|OOptQPnFaa	i dont. i like down to earth guys and artists =]  jocks r annoying lol|`|ICw7gjuIaa	they like big guys who they think can beat up anyone for them|`|c68XWGltaa	because they are and always will be better than you.  get over it.|`|324cdd2706638f6d6bf41b469c741e8caa	our rock hard abs usually have something to do with it...|`|KRDwCai5aa	they're diesel.|`|FjdU3gzpaa	hav nice body, popular, active, fit, "cool", well-known, heroes, people who make the school teams better, nice hair, eyes, dick,|`|XKWJg9Ruaa	I dont like jocks.

I think most [preppy] girls do because, most of the time they're attractive and in shape.  I like my skater boysss|`|IGgkEO9qaa	I personally do not like jocks. But, I think that most women or girls like jocks because they seem tough and strong.And most women like a man who is strong and will be able to so to say "rescue" her when needed. Some women feel as if a weaker guy, is not going to protect them. And usually because jocks have abs and abs are hot.|`|g5GKcf7daa	I like them because of they're cockiness. Although, it can get really old really quick if he treats you like one of the guys or doesn't treat you like a lady.|`|y9z65Rndaa	maybe because of they're fit and confident,   but i don't like jocks more of an artistic type|`|WB028eTDaa	=/ No idea.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	They like funny guys more than jocks.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	Because they hold dick & balls...lol

With my ex, he always got turned on when i was lightly brush my fingers on his lower stomach. He also got turned on when I'd breath on part of his ear, and suck on it a little too =]
HUAYinN7aa	Talk to her more about it, my advise is that if you do end up having one make sure that the third person is not a close friend. And make sure that all three of you talk about it before it happens. From my own personal experience a threesome can real mess with a girls head, so make sure your talk to her before and after, answer any questions she has honestly!  Have fun! BE SAFE!|`|AA10791200	try a couple of margaritas (all 3 of you) and see where it leads, be suggestive but not pushy. enjoy if it all goes your way.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	booze and the right girl - let her choose the hottie|`|DytfqrkSaa	Stop being a douchebag and settle for one woman? Or go into the porn industry, besides threesomes aren't all they are cracked up to be.|`|AA10682405	My initial reaction to this is to day, if you are committing to a woman (she is your girlfriend).. don't bring other women into the bed. That'll make your girl feel insecure, and having JUST her is probably not going to be enough for you after that. If you want to commit to her, commit to her. Don't try to bring other people into it.  If you're still going to try to go for it, just talk to her about it, and see what she says. If she is against it, please respect your wishes. She deserves that.  Don't, my any means, use alcohol to get her to agree to it, because she will regret it afterwards. Do you care about hurting your girlfriend? If you do it this way, she will be hurt.
8eee24bd02326603be44e37c10b3b6daaa	There's nothing wrong with that...you should be proud of yourself...Don't let peer pressure ruin your morals...God want's us to wait til marriage for these thing's....Don't even stress about it...Trust me when you least expect god will send a beautiful person into your life....just wait......|`|dF7pM10kaa	Try dating/partying/going to bars/etc|`|91c6bKdwaa	wow... you should come out of your shell and meet a girl or something|`|dMMKsasEaa	as i would say, donk someone. hahahahahaha jk. its sweet in a way that your still one. if your scared just wait until marriage and find the perfect person. but if your desperate and really wanna kiss someone, go to like a bar or club. just be careful and dont do anything your gonna regret!|`|UyULJUx1aa	You should run around and say "whoot!" Because somewhere out there are a lot of girls looking for a guy who isn't going to give them an STD. You are a rare commodity. But now's about the time to start meeting some of those girls. Be a friendly, outgoing, fun person. Or go the opposite route and be dark, brooding and silent. Both seem to be pretty effective. Good luck.

Ef5gadRQaa	I don't agree that because your girlfriend wants to split temporarily it means that she definitely wants to see other guys or doesn't want to be with you. Some women truly see temporary splits as a way to save a relationship when they don't know how else to do it. There are many reasons why she might be suggesting it, but my feeling is it could be she doesn't feel appreciated (especially as she is so young and a mum) and is hoping that a break would reinforce any feelings you have for her and you would prove to her how much you love her. If you want, there are ways of showing her you can do that without having to split.|`|AA12145457	yup its weird. she seems liek one of them people who wants to be with you but doesnt want it to be classed as *in a relationship*. no idea why. commitment...scared of commitment, scared when things get serious. no idea why. its silly! and yup, its selfish and it hurts but its liek one of my tutors. she has been woth her partner for 30 yrs but never married. he proposed a few times thoughout them yrs but she just refuses to marry. Fo f c u k's sake...why not? she just says 'no'. weird. i sympathise with you rigth now. its not fair on you. specially if she doesnt give reasons as to why. just give her some space. it should be fine. it'll give her time to miss you. I dunno...sounds silly but migth wrk that way. be patient. she will come back :)|`|vztEwvT8aa	Mate...you can't say anything to her. You have no choice but to just accept it, sh*t I know but you aren't the first bloke to be this situation (especially with regards kids) and you wont be the last.    If you start telling her you'd do anything she WILL just keep you like some puppet on a string. Move on and quickly...that is the only thing that changes their minds...then it's up to you.|`|43a0f96cedfd8467fd9c43ea79d0f06daa	18 is so young i bet she can see all her mates going out every friday/saturday night getting drunk having fun a bit of slap n tickle with some lads, i bet she feels she is missing out and her life is in a rut.  Sounds like you've got a choice let her fly around for a bit or she will leave the nest completely, she`s just found out being a young mum isnt what its cracked up to be.  Try and find out if she is using this as a stepping stone to being long term single if so you have a real problem.  Sorry if sound harsh but ive been where you are now.|`|DOPQrfsLaa	No girlfriend should be like that. You can't just leave someone for a few days to go out with other people, thats not a healthy relationship. you should probably just leave her. it'd be possibly best for you. it sounds pretty disfunctional from here|`|r6OQkyIGaa	She wants to be single !  She is stringing you along.|`|qTSjun4Laa	dude shes 18. shes not mature yet. you probably are. But she still feels like shes young and should enjoy herself. but talk to her. if she wants to leave, find someone ready to settle down.
pKzH1cFHaa	Tell her she stays or goes for good. There is no turning back. Don't put up with that. In fact, dump her for good. Why should she get to have some fun and expect that everything will just be okay after that? What a selfish brat.
604SrDw3aa	be like "awww, thanks friend" =]|`|NENNHNVPaa	Or anything?  Does this mean you wouldn't even want to be friends with this person?    If he does get you something ... be polite and thank him.  If you are willing to extend a hand of friendship then include a "thank you for being my friend"  rather than a simple "thank you".   Even if you don't like him at all, it never hurts to be polite.|`|t7XnGkSOaa	just say thank you a lot and tell him it was sweet and that you appreciate it.  maybe you could say that you didn't have time to get any valentine's gifts this year if you want, but other then that you could just ignore the topic of not getting anything for him.  if he asks you out just tell him you value his friendship and would like to keep it at that.|`|by5bl5dhaa	OOOH, ok im in the same position. He wants to give me all this stuff because he still likes me, soooo, what i am going to do is give candies to everyone with little cards, not the childish ones, but you get the point.

e133d4b563c42c935ce6fdb09c30019baa	Lower your standards. You are expecting to get guys that shower. This will be a dead end. Go against your instincts and go for a guy your libido is repulsed by.  Guitar Heroes and WOW enthusiasts are quite interesting people once you get past the pizza stains on the shirt and the occasional bout with IBS. GO GET EM TIGER|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	You have high standards.  Just keep looking.

GNQ70MEFaa	I wouldn't advise you to have sex at your age or before marriage, but use protection whether she wants to or not. There's no need in both of you being that dumb in this situation. It only takes one time to get pregnant, and if she is so insistent on not using protection, you might want to question her sexual history. Abortions and pregnancy care are not free.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Run, don't walk as far and as fast as you can - AWAY from her.    If she wants it that badly, and is being that irresponsible about it, she will find someone else.    You don't need this chick in your life, you would be compromising too much and will get hurt.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	get her on the pill or just a pill for that one time|`|5ymRR7Mtaa	DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

Other then that-you need to tell her that you will wear protection if she dosen't want it then she can sleep with someone else.  I'm sorry to be like that, but she has got to be stuipd to want to have sex with out protection and dosen't care if she get pregnant. Talk to her about it and if she still won't do it think about this  Can you raise a child?  Can you deal with her being pregnant?  Can you deal with knowing that she ended a life because she was stuipd and you didnt man up (for lack of a better term)?  Can you deal with anything eles that might happen?  Sex isn't that great, so I would wait until you met someone that will use proction (it shows you both care)|`|D5CVoI7Yaa	holy crap!!!  you would have to be STUPID to have sex with a girl that wont use protection...   you should def be using it.. no matter what!  what if she has aids! and she doesnt want u to use it cuz she feels alone and wants u to have them too!  i know it is extreme but i have heard stories...   serioulsy use it use it use it use itttt!!!!!  and personaly you are too young to have sex !  geez|`|Wt81sGW5aa	you lucky bas****|`|m43bYTrlaa	do not go for it without protection!  she may say shell get an abortion and ****  but she may be lying and just want to move in to your house and **** up your life because either she doesn't like her parents or thinks her life will be easy  im just stating that possibility   use protection just to be safe  and if she doesn't want you to   just don't tell her you have a condom|`|fZjHAxwHaa	no  your both 15, you dont know what yuou'll do if she gets preganat  an abortion is wrong, there is not need to murder and unborn life and adoption isnt needed either why have a child if you KNOW your going to put it up for adoption  thats jsut stupid.  tell her no, or your going to be safe. its not right to put a childs life up against a stupid teenager. a baby cant defend themselves, be the good person and set things straight.|`|pqyLfCNVaa	**** that use a condom  no matter what she says    she'll regret it for sure|`|e28P8gWraa	Talk to her about it, she might be allergic to latex, if so get the non latex ones. Its not a good idea to not use protection but if you dont PULL OUT FOR GODS SAKE, its not full proof but its better than nothing. No matter what she sais DONT RISK PREGNANCY, thats just stupid she is too young to be making decisions like this.    This is whats wrong with out teenagers. Dont become another statistic.|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Ok, maybe she wants to actually get pregnant, and tie you up like that.  Try talking to her about it.  Explain to her why it's so important for you to use protection.  If she doesn't want protection then don't do it.  Besides...You are not legal to have sex until you are 16 years old, even if you are both under 18.  If she does get pregnant it's not going to look too good for you.      Use protection or DON'T do it!|`|e7I0PXBNaa	Tough situation. you might try asking her why she doesn't want protection, is she allergic or something? jk. She might not want to have it because she might think that it will make it feel weird or something. The fact that you guys are fifteen doesn't help the situation, figure out what you can live with. Talk to her, you might have to put your foot down, and say that you wont unless there is some protection involved. I hate to say it but she can't have sex unless your willing, so that might convince her. I would say no to going for it,if you can't agree or come to a compromise on this simple thing then you will most likely have other problems later on. Its a really weird situation...good luck!|`|0a5e3ca6e627a0f07f1948ce4430d13eaa	the best thing is too wait til marriage|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	make her take the pill|`|VYVI9H6Eaa	talk to her about it and go from there..    i hope i helped! =)|`|yTD84yFlaa	Tell her to close her legs for a good 4 years.

You're 15, you shouldn't be faced with the responsibility of being a father. It's not her decision whether you wear a condom or not. If she doesn't like it then don't sleep with her. Don't risk STDs or getting a girl pregnant.|`|hZL7hCloaa	don't do it without a condom. Listen to Tom Leykus|`|8a2a91d64a774b8e3294c2cc6998db32aa	No matter what, use protection. This girl could be trying to trapping you into a pregnancy obviously. Besides, what are the chances that this 15 year old girl is on any kind of birth control. You don't want to be stuck in a rut. If she refuses to use protection, then your the smart one to not go through with it.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	No no no no no.  It's possible she could just be trying to trap you.  So if she gets pregnant you have to stay with her forever.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	don't ruin your life, wear protection. condoms are easier to change then diapers.|`|oqO6ff4caa	i would tell her you are not having sex unless a condom is used. honestly, it's not worth it to get pregnant and there is something really odd with her not wanting to use any protection lol|`|qthF1stJaa	dont be silly wrap your willy|`|gUUtGcbBaa	shes an idiot. dump her.|`|WTiMxoxFaa	use it anyways i mean no disrespect to ur girl but how often are u with her do u know if shes doing anything behind ur back and besides fooling around like that if u do get her pg then she may think shes got all the plans on what to do but both ur guys' parents will find out besides 15 is still little young yet at least wait till 18|`|16BAkagYaa	Im proud that youre kind of against it. For one, always use protection! If you do get her on the pill, she has to wait one month before it starts to work. An abortion (other than being an ethical issue) can be very painful and mentally it can mess you up. It sounds like she kind of wants to get pregnant to keep you guys together, but being 15 is no time for her to become a mother it will ruin both of your lives! Tell her you guys be protected or its a no go!~|`|z2izukQJaa	DO NOT HAVE SEX WITHOUT PROTECTION! first of all 15 is wayyy to young to be having sex. and its definitely way to young to be having a baby!     and so what if she gets pregnant, your just going to be ok with her murdering your child. because thats what she will be doing. or your just going to be ok with her giving your child away....you think its ok to be stupid enough to not use protection but not deal with the consequences. that is the most selfish thing i've ever heard.    if she wont let you use protection she is crazy. either she is trying to trap you or she is crazy    be smart kid.    dont give in.    if she loves you she would respect the fact you wanted to be safe|`|Ov4RVYa7aa	The very possible consequences of unprotected sex are not worth it. Especially when you're 15.    Never have sex without a condom.  It is unsafe and NOT a smart idea.     There are a couple of reasons why she might not want protection:    1)  Condoms slightly impair the pleasure  2)  I don't know her so I am not accusing her, but I have heard of young girls trying to get pregnant.    If you can't convince her that unprotected sex is not a good idea, then it's a good idea that you just don't go for it.|`|9HtY062Kaa	don't be a fool, wrap your tool!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wear a rubber.|`|AA12290249	well.. first off. good for you for wanting protection. second, you're a little young to be having sex, but w/e your choice.    thirdly, you need to tell her that you don't want to have sex without protection. i can't believe she doesn't want protection, i mean really, she's the one who has more chances of things happening to her.     --if this is your first time--    remember the consequences of sex, and that it is a really big step and that things won't be the same usually. it's seriously something you should wait until you married or at least older and more mature to do, but like i said before, it's your choice.    definitely don't have sex without protection though especially at your age.     good luck|`|ELbs3Dpwaa	It is not a matter of convincing her ~ protect yourself!  Avoid the early responsibility of being a father or of allowing the murder of your unborn child.  A 15 year old father is a terrible choice.  Plus you should wait until you are older.      WEAR a condom or better yet say NO and choose ABSTINENCE!|`|xJYsGJOCaa	if you're doubting yourself you shouldn't do it.    and you should NEVER do it without protection unless you're purposely trying to getpregnant, it almost sounds like she's trapping you by getting pregnant, seeing as she's already talking about pregnancy ppossibilities it's obviously on her mind.    ...and isn't 15 a little young to be thinking about this...|`|easYYET3aa	first of all, there are many things than can go wrong w/out protectioln std's, herpies. HIV, teenage pregnancy..which can ruin her teenage life, im glad your the one who cares for her and is concered to wear protection, u should tel u wont have sex unless u wear a condomn....there are so many risks that come in its just not worth it|`|Hj7fcbjzaa	One night of fun could potentially lead to 18 years of child support.  She is not the only one that would be affected if a pregnancy did occur, so she should not be the only person who has some say in the decision.    Even if her intention is to use abortion as birth control, ask her which she would prefer.  A condom, or surgery.  The choice should be obvious.|`|qJ4mqzrhaa	maybe she has Hiv and she wants u to get it too and i think u guys are young and it's wrong to get an abortion .just tell her we need to use condom and if u guys wanna have sex without protection ,u should get check out first.|`|AuS9UQfQaa	Maybe she wants to get pregnant and is lying to you so that she gets pregant by you and keeps the baby.    I have no idea.  Maybe she thinks you cheated on her so she's planning on giving you AIDS?    Just kidding...really, I dunno.  Convice her that you are wearing a condom.  Buy some, and don't have sex unless you are wearing it.|`|6NqcZFd1aa	pull out|`|cY3GdDA3aa	First of all, it's foolish to have sex without protection at any age. If she wants to have sex without protection, she is obviously not mature enough to realize this. It's not as simple as "getting an abortion," does she understand the physical and mental trauma she'd deal with if she did that? Or if she carried the baby to term and put it up for adoption, the physical changes she'd go through at 15 and the emotional scar she'd have?    You are obviously a very smart and sensible person and you realize the right thing here. You need to have protection. I can't tell you to not have sex, because quite frankly I don't think anyone on here who can or will tell you that you'll listen to. All I can say is be smart and use protection.     If she absolutely refuses to use protection, then you should be the smart person you are and refuse to have sex with her. There are immense consequences for not using protection and they certainly do not outweigh the benefits.|`|y4y3nPCnaa	Why wouldn't you wear a condom? Its the same thing. Whats the big deal? I mean, do you wanna be a dad, and ruin your life at age 15? Kid, you got a long way to go....|`|5qf0QLIbaa	i wouldn't do it without a condom.  you really dont want to go through with the whole pregnancy thing.  just talk to her about birth control.|`|mwkfirjRaa	It's odd because she is not being truthful with you.  She wants to get pregnant and there is every possibility that you will be paying child support for the next 18 years at a minimum.  Perhaps you're too young to pay now, but the obligation will not go away, and as an adult your wages will be garnished and you may not be able to get a drivers license or any kind of professional license as long as you owe back child support.    15 is way too young to be making these kinds of adult decisions - choices that will affect you for the rest of your life.      My advice is to wait until later to be sexually active.  And, if you're too foolish to wait, don't even think about doing anything without protection.    Think of protection as a second chance - to come to your senses before you make a mistake that will change your entire life.  And, not for the better.|`|33D9CDWwaa	I would say that most of us in our adulthood DOUBTFULLY know anyone we messed around in middle school.  She might be great today but 10 years down the road, you will probably not even live in the same state.  I see hot guys I used to like in middle school and high school online and they are fat or ugly or total losers.  And then some other people that I never looked at are these GREAT awesome sexybots.  (okay and some of the hot guys are still hot ...)    NEWAYS, wear a condom.    And just now, that some girls WANT to get pregnant.  You are legally bound to the child and typically fathers get the crap end of the deal in such matters when things go sour.    You convince her by saying "Im not going to stick my thing in your thing unless this thing goes on my thing."    and if you cant convince her, then NO you should not go for it.    You start making allowances now, you'll be a walking STD when you get older!  And thats gross.  No hotness makes up for herpes.    Just sayin|`|cVbXmkk6aa	Pull Out!! XD and remember the whole point of sex is to have FUN!! XD XD|`|TsoXZKSyaa	I'm not going to lecture you on your age and sex and all that, that isn't the problem here.  The problem is the very same as that of an adults.    You definately SHOULD wear protection!!! And her attitude of just having an abortion is not a good sign at all.  And the fact that she does not take your opinion seriously on this very serious matter is worrysome.  If you had a child it would be your child as well, do you really want these kind of things to happen to your child? I am not against abortion, and I'm not here to lecture you on it, I believe that it is necessary in some cases, and it's rather gray in others.  But to have unprotected sex knowing full well that you could get pregnant and saying basically "oh, well i'll just kill it, no big deal" just because you want to fool around, and not considering your partner's feelings? That's just terrible!!!    You definately should NOT go through with this, especially because you feel uncomfortable of the circumstances, tell her that you want it to be protected sex or not at all.  (she'll give it to you anyway i'm sure).  But consider her choices...I think you should really talk to her about this, because even protected sex can lead to pregnancy :S    I'm sorry if I'm being too harsh here, but trust me, an attitude like that isn't good.  and YOU need to be comfortable with this too.    The reason she would want unprotected sex is because it feels better if there isn't a condom, but you can get really thin ones, and i definately think you should!!!    I hope everything works out okay for you :) I really really do, good luck!!! :)|`|qL3dGTXDaa	That is just what that little embryo or child born would want....to be destroyed along with the both of you. I sense you have your head on straight and realize what playing with matches has the potential of doing.    To be honest...intercourse without protection feels better.|`|kLjLJKBUaa	I cant say i didnt want to have sex when i was 15, never got the chance though.  I dont think im old enough now to say "dont do it," i am only 20.  But when it comes down to it, WRAP IT, DEFINITELY.  She is not old enough to get an abortion on her own, her parents would come into play.  ALSO you cant forget that once she has a baby in her, she might change her mind.  I KNOW YOU DONT WANT THAT.    In Short: WRAP IT, ALWAYS. If she doesnt want you too, tell her to grow up.  Just because she says "OH YEA IL GET IT ABORTED! OR PUT IT UP FOR ADOPTION!" THAT IS SUPER SUPER CHILD LIKE!  Which makes me think she is definitely not ready mentally.    -Chris|`|cMrxyWQ0aa	Ew, she sounds like a skank, if she doesn't use protection for what what makes you think she will for other guys? Which also mean she could have an STD or AIDS for all you know.    Don't you have moral values? Why would you want to do it with someone who you probably wont see after high school?    If you decide to do it: Why NOT use a condom? WHEE 10 seconds to buy the damn thing and put it on your meat. Is it really THAT big of a hastle or what?|`|xVdfo2HRaa	well you have known her for a long time, so I doubt that denying her sex without a condom will make her run... but ask her why she doesnt want to use protection. but dont go through with it without being safe! I would say that its not worth doing unless ur being smart about it... believe me, she wouldnt want to get pregnant.|`|13ZOEakYaa	be safe.   and be like baby youre not ready for babies.   do the researchand share with her. maybe shes testing you
KPXwwwMMaa	Depending on how bad the situation is, you could be a compulsive liar or perhaps a pathological liar.     There are a few reasons why people resort to this. Maybe you are scared of being rejected, so you beat people to the punch by chasing them away with your lies.   The fact that you know you have this problem is very helpful. If you can admit that up front, you can help people help you.     You aren't going to just 'stop lying' on your own. Have a couple close, trusted friends that know that you lie constantly, and who have pledged to help keep you accountable for the things you say.    They can call you out on your lies, and gradually, you will realize that once these people don't run out on you, you have nothing to fear in telling them the truth.    Here are some helpful resources about chronic liars:  http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/confr...    http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/confr...|`|7wumH6kDaa	wow. what's your secret. lol. But just think before you say something. if that doesn't work then go to a counciler or someone and they might help you.|`|BHUESXpaaa	My suggestion is do not speak too much for a while, like a week until a month or speak every time you do really need to speak, say the truth, if you're not, so say "NO, I'm NOT !!", if you have not, so say "I HAVE NOT !!". Do not lie only for getting much compliments from your friends, your friends will respect you with the way you are, do not be shy to tell the truth although it's hurt or hard to say. Introspects your self for a while. it can control your emotion to lie.    The key is on your own self, it depends on how strong you can control your self to not lying. my suggestion or everybody's will not giving big effects to you if you still do not have power to control your bad behavior..    Wish it's useful for you. I'm sure you are very honest person, because you were lying when you asked and wrote this question in here, lol :D
DOPQrfsLaa	This sounds like retarded middle school drama. Shes just hatin on you and all you need to do is just forget about her.If she doesnt respect you then idk even know why you would still hang around her. if she wants to shove rude in your face shove it back.
DOPQrfsLaa	Yeah his name will still be on there because he hasn't deleted you yet
LX6AQ4kuaa	Yes, it is absolutely possible because society looks at depressed people as people who don't want to live anymore. A depressed person often gives the impression that they are not interested in much but their own world. They can emanate negativity unintentionally too.     Some people live the way you described: in a love and hate relationship in which you can't let your partner go but you don't have a good word to him. There are many people like that but their family life is usually not good.
0PvpGjSqaa	well for starters they should not be fighting in front of you, secondly there really isn't anything you can do because their arguing has nothing to do with you. If anything, I would suggesting opening up to your parents about how much their fighting hurts you. Maybe if you share that with them they will be more aware of what they are saying and how they treat each other.|`|OPirzwrUaa	I cant believe Im saying this . But, I watched an episode of dr phil just today . It was about RAGE . exactly what you described . It impressed me so much because I am the same kinda jerk as your dad. I do the same things . I dont watch much t.v. . But I geuss God musta did whatever he does and WALLA ! I found myself in front of the t.v. watchin myself being described through other peoples words and lives .  It opened my eyes to what I'm doing and helped me alot . I'm sorry for you guys having to deal with the same kinda guy my family has to deal with .   check it out dr. phil . com . hope it helps . wait till your dad cools off and tell him you'd like to talk to him about it and show him the sight .   Keep in mind , your dad loves your mom , he just has a stress induced sickness . it is cureable and your family can be ok   good luck sweety . it stinks being me right now and your dad right now too . believe me , he doesnt enjoy being hurtfull to the people he loves . just sometimes the stress of protecting and providing for the ones you love causes you to act out in really bad ways .|`|otYGbapNaa	Okayy first of all how old are you most kids that are worried about there parents getting divorced are like maybe 12 or 13 and i must  say you have a very big vocabulary for that age.  but anyways  theres really nothing you can do  trust me im 16 and my parents fight all the time my moms told me flat out that if she didnt need my dad for money and a house shed be gone in seconds and yeah i understand its hard to hear hearing your dad say get a lawyer my moms heard it many times and its even worse when they fight right in front of you like they dont give a care if you hear or not. yeah my dad does the same thing screams his lungs out makes everyone else feel like crap then gives them the cold shoulder like he cant hear anyone else.trust me your not the only one who goes through this.but if your parents want a divorce then they should get one.think about it.you dont want your mom to be unhappy and crying all the time because of your dad.its not worth seeing your mom go through  that.and its not worth it seeing her cry all the time.guys can be very manipulative.and most of the time girls break before guys do.so your mom not only needs to be strong for herself but also you girls .you dont deserve to listen to them fight and hear what all there screaming about.its not far to you.and i pity any person that goes through this or ever has.lifes hard ,complicated.and flat out not fair.but everone has to do whats best for them.so if your parents do end up getting a divorce it happened for a reason.and sorry hun but theres nothing really you can do about it. parents could honestly care less what there kid has to say about a situation.  trust me when i say i know exactly what your going through  kay?  lovelovelove  Audrey!      good luck girl and stay strong!|`|5510075010daf3a8c165ba1145b8d2beaa	There is nothing you can do or say to help them.  You CAN help yourself though.  Do your very best not to worry about them.  Leave the room (or house if possible) during fights, especially when your Dad is drinking.  Whatever happens with them it will eventually be ok, even if they do get a divorce.|`|5IkZ64aFaa	You can do many things to help your parents and your family.  Sometimes parents do not really understand how they affect their kids and how they feel.  I would encourage you to seek some counseling to help you deal with what has already happened and how you can learn how to cope.  Have you thought about talking to your school counselor?  Talking to your mom and your dad at a neutral time to explain how you feel.  Using a lot of "I" statements.  For example, "mom and dad, I really need to talk to you about something---it will take about 15 minutes, but I need to tell you how I have been feeling lately.  I feel like I can not talk to you about what is going on in the home.  I understand that whatever you two argue about, it seems to be happening frequently and I am having a hard time coping with all the stress in the house.  I see my mom crying in pain when you two argue, I see my dad in rages at times."  I hope that these are some good examples of how to approach your parents.  It will be a difficult discussion/conversation, so prepare yourself.  You sound like a very  caring person, and you can talk to them--you may need to prepare for this discussion and write on paper some words and feelings that you need to say to both of them.  Obviously you can not make anyone change, but you can control you and your actions.  Please call the Boys Town National Hotline at 1-800-448-3000 if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone.  We have counselors available 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  You can also look at our website at boystown.org.  Take care, and good luck.  Let us know how the conversation went or what your decision was.  Counselor, KJ
aIBLEjwnaa	Girls love it when you tell them they are special.  And make you feel special.  Use big words to describe how they look.

As long as you live under his roof, He rules. Making a scene in public only justifies his beliefs and standards.  Your sexuality doesn't come into play here at all. Your behavior definitely does. You behaved like a child.    When you are on your own, when you are paying the bills and rent, then you can go out and shop and wear whatever you want! Oh, by the way, Men & Women discern things about you by what you wear also. You wear women's clothing? They can tell.|`|qjMP3EiGaa	At least your dad was willing to take you out and get you something nice.  Oh, and YEAH he doesn't want you dressing in women's clothes regardless of how unisex it looks.

Next shorts you're gonna have, he will check it for sure, he sounds extremely serious and threatening. You'll just waste your money because he will rip them off for sure. He is really insecure about your sexulity right now, because altough you know you are straight, there's no way he can really know it. If you really want those type of shorts, try to find them in the men's section. Try many stores. Even if it's a little bit loose, men's clothes are just made like that. For the same size, women's clothes are way tighter than men's.  You'll have your freedom once you move out of their house, don't worry.

w4ZPaxsbaa	No it's Not your 'Duty'!    On the contrary, one-sided relationships are more apt to be the ones that Fail!  Not only due to sexual 'favors' but for a whole gamut of reasons that primarily and basically boil down do one fact: the selfish person does not R E S P E C T you! As a person nor as an equal nor as a Woman.  Unless you're married to this very selfish guy, set a boundary: It's two-way or it's No Way.    If he digs his heels in, show him the door, or you pack-up and leave, depending on who pays the rent.

But it really is more easy for a man to have orgasm than for women, generally speaking a women needs more attention, plus she really has to be in the mood. As long as your partner tries the best he can it's ok. It's really easy to see when someone is selfish. If someone is told they shouldn't expect a fair relationship, well if that bothers them they need to leave. And it should bother them.
acWyJ3t0aa	You answered your own question in the end . What you asked the way I read it is how can you attract honest , trustworthy , friends toward you . The answer is as simple as your question , you become an honest trustworthy person and you will get the same treatment back . People recognize bad and they recognize bad ,  so you attract what you are . Your past is gone and done and it won't happen overnight , but work on one person at a time and soon you will find that you have some of those already around you just waiting for you to decide what you are going to be .|`|RILZcr6Daa	I can be you friend.Lond distance friend

No decent employer would expect you to skip school for a job interview. If they're willing to hire a student, they will be willing to work around your school schedule.      You should call the director back and explain your school hours, and see if they can schedule at time when you're not in class.  If they aren't willing to do that, then you should look for another job, because chances are they would schedule your work hours during school as well.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you do what your parents tell you to do.    if you can not be there on time, you won't get the job.  they evidently need someone there at a time you have to be in school.  better luck with your next job application and interview.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Do you drive to school?

HDEbDPp3aa	look,i'm also having this kind of problem.on satarday i'have proposed a girl first time in my whole life.actually i talked to a girl first time.                                                                                            after the coaching i stood out waiting for her but my friends father was outside and started talking to me.than i go behind her and asked for physics notes,she said yes for that.since than i'm following suggestion.             than i'again followed her this time i asked her for sample papers,she said o.k.(that is my own i'dea)than i'again followed her(thinking that maybe i'didn't said this to her that'll be too late) i said that straight to her.she smiled and said"yes o.k but but not in front of these guys (as we r in a crowdy market) see ran away smiling.today i'm going to have the answer.                                            so my friend go and say your feelings maybe she also likes u,or if no that can't be solved.(and by the way " LOVE IS BLIND AND DUMB ALSO" love don't need words.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Just try your best if you mess up then just keep going, you'll do find and good luck!|`|6UeGyxNcaa	well, Im a guy. But first of all she might think your kinda cute cus your shy and all, so she might like you more, dont worry about your language since you will learn soon and be just as good as anyone else! Just talk to her like you would to other girls, be nice and funny just like you would with your other friends, maybe get some guy friends and friends that are girls and go to the movies, ask her if she want to go to!|`|kLjLJKBUaa	you HAVE To talk to her or shes going to get the wrong idea, she might start thinking you dont want to talk to her, or dont like her.  its normal to feel nervous to talk to someone you are interested in.  you just need to suck it up, go over there, and act-a-fool!|`|sTqfKpbraa	mouth....ha ha ha    i mean just be yourself and let them talk  more|`|zdr2M7vUaa	easy bro girls like everything thats nice just think romantic and talk nice and sweet talk her hmm nervous i wont lie i was too xD  but idk in time u will get better at talking hmm idk in ur case try to get hyper or something so u can be careless but stay on ur game at the same time :D|`|08f801cb12076679501327c507f16f44aa	I was like you when I was young. Then I learned that if you tell a girl what you think about them, they like it.    What I mean is, do you think she's pretty? Then tell her!  Do you like her eyes? Tell her!  Does she have a nice smile? Tell her!    DO NOT tell her she has a nice *** or boobs!!!    My Mom always told me how important honesty and manners are, and that you ALWAYS treat a woman like a lady. She was right.  Women like to be treated like ladies, not tramps.    It may take some time to get up your nerve, but you need to tell this girl that you think she's beautiful, and that you would like to get to know her better.    Trust me, every girl I've ever said "I think you're pretty" to, has always greeted me with a smile from that day forward.    TELL HER!!!|`|lXsSmPugaa	be urself. if u feel nervous just say i have to go to bathroom or something.|`|hV6h60Liaa	Just be yourself. I know that sounds too easy but that's really all there is to it.|`|oMhf57aUaa	dude me and you hav the same problem....lol  but tha difference is that im fat and to some girls is bad   i need advice on how to talkk to girls to so if any of you want to help me to ur more than welcom|`|E4CR9wJIaa	be confident  maybe this video can help you:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63bWYFGBT...|`|rE3CqHupaa	What you need to do is look in the mirror at yourself and tell yourself you have the confidence to love yourself and be happy with yourself.  Your working on your english, so that is good feel proud that you are actually learning and making an effort.  Just one day if she is glancing at you and yall make eye contact smile at her and keep eye contact.  Maybe she will start the talking
21Wk2mu5aa	Find somebody who treats you the way you want to be no matter where you are.|`|BeTBLiCoaa	If he would love you he would do nothing to offend you. Leave hi a**|`|db0df80b53e0d913b731410541d71d76aa	1.  Either work with him, or date him.  You are seeing too much of each other.    2.  He is overcompensating for his affection for you.  Instead of treating you well, as he'd like to, he's treating you poorly.  It's a problem he hasn't solved yet.  Let him know that it's really bothering you.
HivQdKgwaa	Yes you should definitely tell her, if not for her best interests then at least so she doesn't catch an STD from him and she can get tested to be on the safe side.     I'd want my sister to tell me if she knew my husband was cheating . Don't you think your sister deserves to be with someone who loves and respects her and doesn't cheat . Do you really want her to waste her life away with a disgusting cheater . I wouldn't want that for my sister .|`|UinOWcMUaa	You care for your sister ? There is your answer :)        Take Care...|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Don't tell her, set up a situation where she figures it out|`|9GUuVYinaa	blood is thicker than water.  Yes definetly tell her!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Wait until she finds out for herself. It's really none of your business about what goes on in their relationship.|`|erhdsNHHaa	Yes!  She deserves to know, and she will be really embarrassed and feel like an idiot if she finds out that you knew and didn't tell her.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	yeah just make sure you have proof|`|6627NijZaa	if ur a good sister u shud tell her|`|AuS9UQfQaa	Oh noes!  That's awful.    but...I think you should tell her.    It's the right thing to let her know.  Just state facts, don't give her your opinions unless asked for it.  Be supportive.    What if the situation were reversed?  Think about that.    Best of luck.|`|fSSE9cnLaa	OF COURSE YOU SHOULD!!!! It's your sister!!! She will love you even if she is mad at first. Tell her and let her find out for herself|`|cjfKUdbPaa	tell her|`|VSnj6b7zaa	That is your sister and Im pretty sure you don't want her to get hurt. I would take pictures of him (camera phone), and show proof to ur sister just in case she don't believe you (love can sometimes blind ppl). But I would just let her know before it's too late.|`|zdr2M7vUaa	um yeah dont tell her  shes going to ask for proof if u have it okay ur good to go its not what u know its what u can proof|`|VFbOGwN4aa	you should! take a camrea and start spying your sister Boyfriend! don't let your sister end up Crying! or bring your sister boyfriend's Girlfriend he dated to your sister, and talk to your sister boyfriend's Girlfriend in front of your sister: Did you dated (your sister boyfriend name..)|`|sLLLqtQEaa	get proof first or she will think your lying       but you do need to tell her so she doesn't get hurt anymore thinking this guy cares about her|`|gRsuXxkbaa	if  u can proove it yes if not she'll jus get mad at  u|`|irLbG2zCaa	yer her sister, yer supposed to always hav her baq. of course u tell her.. but maybe sum proof will help likk a pic or setting hiim up.|`|59HXAtRHaa	Tell her!!  or lead he into finding out!    I'd rather her know before its too late!!  and if she finds out tht u knew about it she'll hate u 4eva!|`|6423d3e0eb9573a0ed7650b706c1f257aa	You should definitely tell her straightforward. I would take a picture of them cheating, then show your sister. It would be the best proof you can get. If you can't do that, just tell her flat out. If she's a good sister like you, then she'll accept it.
BQ3oXZjGaa	I would just teach your boyfriend how to be friendly and seem like a nice guy then when you invite him for dinner your dad might see that he's not so bad and that he won't bother your studies. I did that with my girlfriends parents, I'm in grade 11 and they didn't like that I was dating their daughter either. When I went for dinner I just put on my smile, made sure to say please and thank you and be casual/friendly. They reconsidered. Of course, my girlfriend put a good word in for me too.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Cross that bridge when you come to it.  I wouldn't tell Dads anything yet.|`|gb9ERmHPaa	are you in 11th grade, or 11 years old?  11th year of schooling you should be 16-17, your dad needs to ease up you have to start sucking **** eventually right?|`|T1CuRwm3aa	if you are year 11 it should be ok|`|YPAHeUucaa	Explain to your dad, that even though he wished different, something just sort of happened. You met a really nice guy who you really enjoy spending time around. Tell him that you understand he may be angry, but you truly have feelings for this guy. Ask him if he wouldn't mind having your boyfriend over for dinner to meet him and get to know him a little.|`|pqyLfCNVaa	when you're ready, or when you guys start getting really serious in your relationship, tell your dad. tell him how much your boyfriend really means to you. he can't really stop you from seeing him anyway. and try and prove to him that you can juggle grades and a bf at the same time|`|qZGkVsKWaa	Don't be afraid to tell him. Just Keep your Grades up. If your Boyfriend Dresses up all "emo" or "Ganster" then he might not approve. =/    Just have a Father-Daughter Conversation I guess..If you want, you can even introduce your boyfriend to your father in person. Yeah. That would be good. If you talk to your father without your boyfriend there, it might not turn out so well. Just tell your Father and do your best =]  Okay, Bye Bye!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You Dad doesn't what to hear about your BF getting all up inside you, what are you going to tell him?|`|8ZoSSslFaa	ask if you can have a friend over for dinner invite him and then ask what your dad thought when he leaves|`|bNCcv2fNaa	Don't tell your father. Here's what you do:  If your brother tells him, just calmly deny it. Like: "Oh we aren't dating dad, just friends. Besides what does (Brother's Name) know anyway?"|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	well tell him how much you like him, but what your dad will see is a little five year old girl asking him this, and srsly your only 11|`|AIftgLEGaa	it's probably a bad idea not to tell him, especially if you're worried about your brother spilling the beans. You will get into a lot of trouble if he finds out from someone other than you. If you tell him, he may not approve, but at least you can stop worrying about your father and enjoy having a boyfriend.|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	honestly my dad was pretty protective over me when i was younger, and he is really good now that i'm older. it got way better when i turned 17 or 18. Do you mean you are 11 years old? or you are in 11th grade? because that makes a big difference..  either way you cannot let your grades slip because dads will always blame it on the boyfriend. haha they always do. but for me to give you more advice i'd like to know how old you are? lol|`|M79usPMkaa	Look, you'll eventually have to tell your father about your boyfriend and the majority of girls make the mistake of waiting until the last minute; which unfortunately is never the best time.  Cause it goes to the dads head like, "What reason is she hiding him from me?"  Get the greetings out of the way, and of course, like most dads, your dad won't respect your boyfriend.  Your boyfriend has to earn your fathers respect -- and that's when you'll really find out if he loves you.  A real man can put up with bullshit like that, and hey, sometimes dads can be out of line.  I had literally gotten into a fist fight with one a couple of years back -- but aside from that you needa tell your dad.    Hope your boyfriend ain't a chump, good luck haha|`|AA12187979	Sounds like you have a really smart Dad.  This is one things us old folks notice, the girls that wait have a lot less problems in life.  In 11 grade there is not much that can come out of a boyfriend girlfriend relationship that has value.      I have 2 kids that didn't wait, raised by a messed up women that started at 14.  Both had some real f'd up times and it took years and destroyed many lives for them to learn the basics.    One basic is no sex unless they are capibe and willing to support a family.  Hanging with a dude now is nothing but furstration.  I have two more children from a squared away women that delayed sex until after High School -- dad was aways on her ***.  So for my kids, no dating until after high school.  Period.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Tell your dad about it and say you are happy to invite your bf around to meet your dad - your dad will feel more comfortable if he gets to know the guy a bit.    Tell your bf to be respectful to your dad too - though he should already know that!|`|1hlIzEnTaa	If you think this relationship is going to last, tell your dad! If you hide it or lie about it, he may think you're trying to hide something from him, or that he has a reason not to like your boyfriend.. dont give him a reason, tell him about all the great things he says does for you, see if your dad would be okay with having him to dinner sometime :)|`|gJXBqPiVaa	your in year 11  you should be able to decide for yourself  and your dad should except your boyfriend|`|abDyYtLhaa	you should come clean to ur dad cause it'll be worse if he found out thru ur brother. explain to him that you really like ur boyfriend and hes a great person! maybe you could even bring your boyfriend over :) also, if you are getting good grades like usual, tell ur dad that u are responsible and mature enough to handle a relationship and studying in school  good luck! xx :)|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Of course tell Dad. You already know his response. Let him know having a bf is part of everyone's education.. It is called, the art of being real.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	maybe you should wait a while so you can prove that he's not affecting your grades and then calmly explain to him that you are almost 17-years-old and you feel that you are ready for a bf and that the guy means a lot to you. make sure you also have your bf talk to your dad and that he looks and sounds presentable when he does. good luck :)|`|1vKiGBF4aa	Sooner or later you will have to deal with it. You could either tell your dad now and deal  with it now while the relationship is still new. Or you could wait it out and see if those beans get spilled by your brother.  And deal with it later, after you have been with your boyfriend longer, and maybe have more feelings for him. Honestly I would tel your dad, so the worry will be gone and all will be delt with. Maybe you can think of what to say and how to say it. Maybe, start off with, " dad I know you told me that this year is study and no boys. But dad I want us to have a honest relationship where I can come to you and tell you everything.  And ask you questions and request your advice. Most importantly I will be able to come to you when I can come to you when I am in trouble or when I just need a friend to talk to. See whathe says! hope for the best and then break it to him. Just tell him you want to talk to this boy at school because you like him. Make sure you point out all the good things about this boy =)  and how he is just a friend!  hehe  I wish  you the best in all of this|`|K3W3f3jtaa	I need help too lol...im also in 11th grade but my bf is in 12th grade  really love him, i dont know how to tell my dad he is really really from back then in the days, well he acts like it, like idk wat to do im reallly scared, so if u find an answer plz send it t me cus i also need help...well good luck on telling ur dad.
3UMZzQCbaa	i was raped and i feel the same why that you do, it was so hard for me to tell someone but it always makes you at rest that someone know besides you, and  am sure it will be hard, but it will get better, just give him some time to think about it all,     and i am sure he feels honored that you told him, and i am sure that  you did not freak him out, with all your emotions, i mean you have to get it out, you can not hold it all in, you know, its not good for you, trust me .    angel|`|m7RrYdz1aa	if hes a good friend he will understand and support you. Because you were able to trust him with something like that i doubt he is going to be stupid about it|`|LE71KIMXaa	i would actually appreciate and that you have that you trust me so much to tell me something so personal. you would actually become a closer friend to me. oh an btw im so sorry that happened to you when you were 13, you are a strong person for getting through all of that
9XuC0Hjlaa	i used to be like this and i found that writing down how i felt helped me understand my emotions and communicate them properly, plus there was really no pressure ( like there is when you have a face to face conversation) and it was a lot easier discussing certain solutions to problems after wards. so maybe you should try sending him a text or an email when you're mad.. after a while you will realize it will get easier to talk about your needs and feelings.|`|5ymRR7Mtaa	yes.|`|vQmb8XZPaa	ok i have been in the same boat.. and sometimes its actually great for us to realize omgah he SEEES im upset.. wow.. but u do need to tell him.. and just say.. i am not good at expressing how i feel im deeply sorry..  but you will eventually in life have to tell someone how u feel.. might as well start now =]|`|gRsuXxkbaa	why dont u have a name ?|`|kULqytREaa	just do whats in ur hart|`|eXQDsy7waa	I dont think you really need to change yourself, if you can only hide yourself and not show your true feelings then really you wont get anywhere with that certain guy. You may find a guy who will accept you for who you are and live with it. But if the answer you are looking for really isnt to break up with him, then think, girl voice it in a different way, if you cant say it to his face write it through a letter, fancy it up and make it look like you put some time and effort into it. If he has facebook or msn or something write it through there. And if you want to overcome being assertive then you have to try to tell him how much you love him. Its not hard, dont be shy just go up to him n hug him n tell him , also say your sorry :P , I hope this helps .!!!|`|YwvXVQLQaa	find out what is or happening with women or girls with this type of problem, maybe its not you but while you are there ask do you have to take two and call them in the morning.
sR6vhbataa	More than the feel is the smell. Oh god I hate the smell of condoms. That rubbery latex smell is such a turn-off.|`|AA11313204	i hate them. but i also have two kids because of that. and im lucky i dont have any more. yes i can tell the difference.|`|QtaPF83iaa	NO i don't like the feel and unfortuneately I can feel the difference. I ended up telling my mom the night I lost my virginity cuz I had some scary issues down there and freaked out.  turns out I'm allergic to them!|`|6Oprylquaa	I don't, it feels very uncomfortable and unnatural. It's very easy to feel the difference.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Sex with a condom is better than having no sex because you don't have any condoms. The certainly reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy and can help to stop the spreading of STD's. I am married so I do not worry about that any more but I wouldn't think of having unprotected sex in this day and age if I was just with a boyfriend or girlfriend that I was only dating around with.|`|R1rVPOdGaa	How would i know, im a virgin.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Old saying about condoms, is its like having sex while in a rubber raincoat.    It feels better without condoms, but...if I was still dating I would use condoms.  First, the ones with a spermicide - just in case she makes a mistake or there is an accident.  Wouldn't want the extra risk of little feet changing everything.  And I have also used a vag. foam (spermicide) with condoms that did not have their own spermicide.    Second, although condoms will not protect against all sexually transmitted diseases - they will protect against some of them.  Some is better than none.    Have known about 3 couples where the girl has said "he needed something to settle him down, so I started skipping my pills ..to make him a Daddy".  In all 3 cases, if anything the guy (their husband) was feeling overwhelmed with all the adult issues - having a child didn't make him settle down - it made him seek a divorce.|`|0eed9c0d5321fb5386d80251ae138fb0aa	What feel?    My circumutilated penis can not feel a damn thing if I use a condom.    I have never been able to reach a climax using a condom.    I finally told my wife to wake me when she was protected by the pill until then I would rather just get a good night sleep. I have to get up in the morning I don't need to spend my night humping away hoping to feel enough to get off.    "Circumcised" guys don't like condoms. We don't have many nerves left to feel with.|`|7R8IPHXIaa	I used it once and it was the last. I totally felt nothing out of it. To tell you the fact the erection just stopped inside the woman's **** and didn't enjoy a thing. Very very very boring. The condom is good to avoid Hiv/aids but anyway I want to feel evrything and get crazy.|`|t3w3cDduaa	I do not like the feel of condoms.  There is DEFINITELY a difference.|`|bgWfcplBaa	I can't tell the difference during at all.  This may be a little TMI, but I like that I am a little cleaner after the deed is done with a condom versus freestyle!  LOL|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Let me answer that with another question...would you ever eat a candy with it's wrapper on? That's how it is with condoms. There is a major difference. But i enjoy dotted condoms, they tickle my insides.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	It feels weird but its better than having too many babies!|`|m8UEGUaGaa	It feels the same to me.|`|EvzEjuOGaa	No I dont but one has to do what they have to do in order to protect themself from Pregnancies and STDs especially the deadly HIV

Clearly people gave you BAD advice last time.  I mean how can you not see that after what happened?  NEVER (as a woman) make a move on your man.  It makes you look desperate. Women are to be pursued.   If you are aggressive, it screams of desperation.  Not attractive.    The way you work is to entice him to come to YOU.  You are the magnet.  He is the steel.  Two pieces of steel don't stick, right?

ypZM5XVQaa	My mother came off her anti crazy medication around 14 years ago. After that she went crazy. So our relationship pretty much turned to me not caring after that. I tried over the years off and on but a couple of years ago I cut her off for good. It was one of the best things I have done. She was a really negative abusive person. My father abandoned me when i was little and i met him once at 11 and talked briefly a few times since. I just got back in touch a coupla weeks ago. It was really insightful finding out the truth about everything.  I mean he did abandon me which is weak but i think he might be okay. I think he made a mistake and i have made a few of my own over the years so i can understand that.  This question reminded me to ring him. He wants to stay in touch and I said i would think about it. I honestly just keep forgetting.  I paid for college myself with student loans which are really huge! and i am still paying them back now. I left home at 17.|`|j4hmUPJgaa	I do not like my parents. I have to talk to my mom or else she goes crazy & gets all depressed. I love her, but I don't like her b/c she is always trying to get in my business. She freaks out if I dont call her every few weeks ( as I mentioned) . My real dad left me, my step dad who raised me for 16 years wont have anything to do with me (b/c he has a new wife) & my newest step dad is cool, but I dont talk to him very often at all. I am 26 years old. I got student loans to pay for school & I didn't finish- however if I would have went to college right after high school I think my parents would have helped me out for the first year or some crap.|`|2hhGgKBZaa	I'm 21, almost 22, and my relationship with my parents is wonderful. They are supportive but not overbearing, they give me advice but are not pushy. They show me love but don't drown me in it, they are awesome!     I didn't go to University (I like in Australia), but if I had wanted to go they would do their best to pay for me or share the expenses with me as best they could.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	im 14-hate my mom  my dads all cool and stuff  when i get to be 18 and school is over im leaving and never ever talking to them again though...maybe my dad, yea probably i plan to tour the world, have a life and friends and basically live my life.  im probably going to end up being that 21 year old barfing in the street all drunk making out with someones husband, and then calling in sick at work  (honestly i hope thats not me but the wayy things are going thats me)
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	as you said if you can judge and tell that he's not playing with you.. just give him the time.. maybe he's still sick.. or busy with something imp..    let him call you back.. and relax.. don't be so desperate.. he'll call up...|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Could be a million things.

Good Luck!|`|TGMUFytraa	Wow, sorry but too long. Got bored.|`|AX3DQw3Paa	Maybe his phone ran out of minutes? Or his phone could just be malfunctioning.
H6gjOGnGaa	It's clear that this is a complicated problem.  My response will be long, but please read through it just as I read through your story.    Primarily this is a problem of her sending you mixed messages.  Yes, she did reject you, but then she did several things that held the door halfway open: she said she would have been with you if not for chance, she suggested you might get married in the future under certain circumstances (however improbable), and she tried to say that you were special in your own way.    This is not a full rejection.    However, you also aren't with her, so you need to think long and hard about what it is she is doing here: you are basically her spare.  There are lots of ways to dress that statement up and make it sound nicer or more palatable, but at the end of the day that is all that she offers you: You can be her backup in case something goes wrong.    That's terrible.    In a relationship you need to look at actions as well as words.  What, other than making out with you while she was lonely and feeling horny, has she actually done for you to make you feel special?  When has she gone out of her way to help you?  Calling you frequently has been a means of venting and having someone to talk to.  It makes her feel better, and it makes you more despondent.  It also keeps a bit of hope in your heart, which keeps you there so she can rely on you.  You are that someone she can run to when she needs to cry, but you are not the one she is officially with, and she is unlikely to change that.    It would be best for me to tell you that you have no chance with her. You should give up.  However, in the interest of honesty, I will tell you that if you are prepared to go far enough, you can win her back.  It will cost you your present identity.  That's right, you will have to completely and totally change who you are, so that you are a different person.  You will have to stop answering her calls, make it clear that other women are interested in you, and generally not be available for her.  You will have to not be nice for her, not do anything for her, and in short not give her any emotional benefits.  Do not be suddenly rude or angry; just be unavailable.  This will cause her to realize that she cannot treat you the way she has been treating you if she wants to have anything with you in the future, and at that point she will re-evaluate her actions towards you.  Note that there is no guarantee she won't just write you off - but this way there is a small chance.  If you continue as you are, there is no chance.    Good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|4EqPMLdkaa	the grass always looks greener on the other side.....  and it never is.....  we always want what we cant have or weren't meant to have  ....she didn't want to get out of bed for the day makes me think she suffers from depression and has a bit of la la land going on, no matter how sweet and beautiful a person she is.   If the tables were turned, you be able to see more objectively and realistically.  Do yourself a favor, don't wait until your in your 30's to marry her.|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	im sorry its 2009 now, unless you find the perfect way to present to her one pink rose,  she will never know how you feel.|`|KWJiswJIaa	In my opinion it seems like you are this girls booty call that she doesn't want to be with you and if she is treating you this way then you DO deserve better. I think you should move on and let her go you are waisting precious moments of your life on this girl. Let it go and move onn!!!...|`|EGi2Xqvaaa	Try to get her somewhere private where you 2 can just talk and express to her how you feel and see from there even if it takes for you to get her totally wasted do it and trust me somethin will come out shes probably not over her ex but tell her you can be the man shes always wanted and he was nothin good for her i hope i've helped sweetie good luck!|`|cmFU81rQaa	yes.  You have infinite chances with her.  She has lasting feelings for you too.    She sounds like the type of girl where you've just got to ignore what she's saying and pay attention to how she's acting.  She feels the same way and if you take charge you'll have her no problem.  Make it in to a relationship.  You can.  It's up to you.|`|2pcxRWX9aa	i am so sorry :/  i can only say one thing you sound like such a sweet guy and any girl would die to have a guy in her life like you.  just keep trying and i hope it does work out.
RnQFwIuUaa	Are you hanging out together? Do you talk to, call or text each other? Start doing those things and when you are at school make it a point to say "hi" to her, smile and wave at her. If you start to talk to her just a little bit each day you will feel more comfortable and not so self conscience.
61Fwbi79aa	The answer to both questions, in both conversations is yes, definitely yes. BTW, I like the way you flirt, in an intelligent way. Dont get me wrong here, I'm not flirting. I'm getting married soon.
gWCqHhmiaa	I suggest that you go tell your counselor. Try to get as little people involved as possible. She is obviously insecure, so accidentally letting the whole school know would not be the best thing. If you tell your counselor then she can inform this girl's counselor and then the school can take it from there. This way her parents won't have to know, which might be what is stopping her from going. Not that they don't want her to, she may just be embarrassed by the fact that she needs a therapist. This will be private with her and her counselor and it could really help her.    The other piece of advice would be to just be friendly. Trust me, it helps. So make general conversation, smile at her in the halls. Go up and talk to her every once in a while. You don't have to be best friends, just be nice!    Good luck with everything and I hope that it all works out!|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Honestly, I don't think you should do anything if her parents are already involved, because for them to know is what's most important.    Telling the school counselor may just make her embarrassed.  I mean, being called down there and having to talk about a touchy subject by any teacher is humiliating. That just make her more sad.|`|kmLKKGGyaa	ugh i had been depressed for a while i still am a little now but its fading away. the problem with depression is sometimes you don't know why you are. to me i had family problems. she may not feel like doing anything but you have to get her out of that mode. make her feel loved. but not a fake loved like "oh are you okay whats wrong?" that just makes it worse believe me it will get her angry. you need One person that she truly trust and she needs to confine in that person. let her tears out everything!!!!!! pick her truest and most trustworthy friend. there's nothing worse than having a bunch of people pile you up with their emotions and feelings when your depressed. you or her friend that she confines in, if your able to have her talk to someone, then she needs to  laugh have her think of great times. have in mind her home life has to contribute especially if its an at home problem.you have to get her out as well become social again. but don't overpower her you don't want her to become more stressed and become even more suicidal she needs to release her stress. about the bullies if she has low self esteem help her out with them! don't let them bully her! i know this sounds bad but tell them off  tell a teacher do something! you cant expect her to get better if shes still getting bullied. and again LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER is important i have been depressed so often that i know how she feels help her out!!!    good luck and best of wishes to her|`|AX3DQw3Paa	Talk to her. Be friends with her. It goes a long way.
dkoGI9nfaa	This is quite complex and it will be best for you to get professional help.  The problem is you have allowed her to do this and she knows that she gets away with it.  Probably because she gets attention when she does it.  You can change her behaviour by sending quality time with her.  You must learn not to react (award) her bad behaviour and praise her for her good behaviour.  This works but requires resilience and patience.  Have activities for the family where all of you take part.  Make sure that the rules of the activity is communicated to the children before you start and don't be tempted to award bad behaviour.  If she for instance yell at you don't be tempted to yell back.  Mimic the desired behaviour.  These are thing you can do but the best will still be if you can get the help of a child psychologist who specialises in behaviour correction.    I have some website addresses for you that would help.  Best is if you Yahoo "Child behaviour"  You will find heaps there.    http://www.childbehaviourproblems.info/?...  http://childparenting.about.com/od/behav...  http://www.attitudebox.com/  (This one looks great but might cost money)    Good luck
JO3HiGfHaa	A confident guy makes himself clear, his actions, attentions, and feelings are well known by others while the shy guy bottles it all up and nobody has a clue about him.|`|E0yIdPytaa	because the confident guy makes it known that he likes the girl.  how's anyone supposed to know somebody likes them if they are even to shy to say anything?|`|lGSUToFQaa	who wants an unsure guy, i want a man in the relationship, i'm a strong woman and i need a strong man, we never know if the shy guy likes us, he never shows it, that changes everything
eX8i4vwRaa	honestly, id love to just sit on the beach and cuddle with a blanket.   not even a walk.. just sit and cuddle :)|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Okay, you might think this is cheezy but I would go nuts for a guy who did this for me:    Leave a rose on her desk/car/etc. in the morning, then take her out in the evening to a really nice dinner in a nice restaurant, and then drive some place scenic and go for a walk.  On the walk, pull some really cute gift out of your pocket and give it to her.  Jewelry is nice-- doesn't have to be expensive either.  Just something feminine and pretty that reminds you of her.|`|By1DJAUOaa	outside places...i know it sounds dorky but...outside nature picnic and just outside alone...so romantic **sigh**|`|q9yGiIPUaa	dinner and movie is cliche     instead of a walk on the beach try renting horses for a few hours, that is something i have always wanted to do with the person i love. if you do this you could really play it out! her vday present could be attached to the saddle.|`|1rLMB7qyaa	HAving sex no im just kidding[but it still is fun] why don't you ask her where would she like to go or if she have  brothers or sisters ask them what do she like to do and surprise and take her to one of the places she love

The simple answer?  Seduce him.    Okay, now on to the complex answer - most men who are serious about a relationship want continual signs that you are committed to the relationship.  This is a mindset issue and not something you can just parrot (unless he's unusually dull), so be prepared to do a little bit of adjusting.    If he asks you about the future, answer from a perspective that assumes the two of you are together.  For example, if he asks about where you'll be in 10 years, "We'll be in a house of our own" is a better answer than "I'll have my own house."  Even if you don't mean to exclude him in the latter answer, it implies it.    Show him that you are a priority.  This is a matter of balance - don't harp on it all the time but from time to time it's okay to mention that you blew off some other event (family, friends, work) for time with him.  He'll like to hear that he's important to you, even if he should already know.    Try to include him in events with family and friends.  This shows that you are integrating him into your life.    Obviously don't do any of this stuff if you don't truly plan to be with him in the long term - it will only make the breakup more confusing and harder to accept.    Of course, assuming he's like the average guy, offering sex never hurts (whether directly or, if you're religious, in the context of "let's hurry up and get married so we can go wild.")  But the other details are also important: they signal that you want to commit long-term, which is an indicator of true love.|`|fH0cZIy1aa	Write him a really personal and special love note. I gave one to my man and made him promise not to open it until v-day. So right now i'm really nervous to see how he reacts to it. You could also make him a valentine card. It will make him feel good knowing that you made something with your own hands and put all that time and effort into it. Trust me, he'll like it more then just a store card.|`|eXQDsy7waa	Hey;    You dont need to give yourself away or buy fancy things or really do anything. If you want to show him that you really love him, just tell him straight out just how much you love him. Go on a really fun date, and just have fun. You shouldnt have to buy things or give yourself away especially if your not ready. Also if you just show him you love him by having sex thats not quite telling him you love him. yes sex is a way of showing love but that should come at the right time and not just a way to show him you really love him. If you want to take my advice just tell him in a really cute way, one that you havent said before.Make it really cute and he will understand just how much you love him.    :)|`|KVITKXuvaa	Just tell him  that u real love him, after that apply what we say, actions speaks louder than words. Treat him well, respect him (I have done this, it works), avoid overreacting over simple issues (take things easy), trust him (dont doubt him for things you are not sure of). And introduce him to ur friends.     All the best gal, you will make it!

But besides that I'm doing aye okay and Valentines day is only 11 days away and another time of the year I get to waste money to show my love that I love and appreciate her; as if she didn't already know that?
edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	sounds like u shouldn't hang out with him, cause ur not into him. don't waste his time.|`|RfoWhZyFaa	maybe he does miss you but he seams busy and you too. it was good to be honest. but you have to tell him that you are moving on. and maybe he just wants sex most guys are like that after sex they run away.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	He prolly really wants to see you|`|1KajpBdaaa	i just answered this...and i am not changing my response|`|JPBggXcwaa	sometimes, exes just do that to make you want to go back to them and then they'll show you their girlfriends...
q9yGiIPUaa	it sounds like he does still like you. it's up to you though on if you want to see him. if you do, explain to him what your reason was on why you didn't want to see him to start with. maybe if he really wants you back then he could change that part|`|H6gjOGnGaa	You asked if you were "too honest," but it's impossible to say unless you tell us what your aims are.    If your aims are to get rid of him, no, in fact you should have told him much sooner.    If your aims are to pursue a friendship, you should have told him but you could have used more tact.    If your aims are to one day date him again, you should not have told him this at all.|`|7AndmAg4aa	just GET OVER IT. god. hes your ex for a reason isnt he? lets just leave it like that so people dont have to listen to your complaing.|`|9XuC0Hjlaa	It gets really messy when you start hooking up with ex's ... iv been down that road several times and it NEVER goes well 4 me, maybe its just me... be careful though and if you dont want to see him then don't go see him. do what you want, not what he wants.
AA10982164	Visit with him, be positive in your visits, tell him bout your day, be yourself.     Ask the nurse if you can bring him food, and if you can, bring in things he likes to eat, hospital food is never the greatest.    Get him cards that he can have in his room so he can be reminded that you care.    Call him, but not too often, he needs to know your okay while he's in there, but he is sick and needs to get rest also.    If he starts worrying about things while he is sick, be positive! If he worries about financial problems, encourage him to stop worrying, and be willing to make temporary sacrifices while he is sick.    Since you are concerned, I am sure that you will be helpful and encouraging.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	i know how u feel my dad was in the hospital for 2 weeks the was home for one and went back for another 2 weeks it's hard but the only thing you can do is visit him what kind of illness does he have|`|Z0KQenm9aa	visits are always good... pray for him...
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	well, it's time you should really tell that to that friend of the friend...    then to your friend who also laughed with her.. just ignore her for a while... if she wants to befriend you, she'll come to you..     find new friends who would care..    then don't, please don't be so good to everyone.. thats the reason why people don't take you into consideration... if you can be bold when you're furious.. then at all the times remember things that made you angry, like this incident and stay staunch and brave!    good luck.. :)
VpU4Aludaa	First of all,her taste a bit expensive.but she has excellent taste.  she is good enough  "big, warm heart"  "ask me"Real  ,real and real experiences.   She  likes to spend her/his money in clothes "Furs coat" or...or .... , jewellery and expensive car.  He should be very strong to "lead and drive"  Her partner well "enjoy" his life with her love.  Thanks
jYL5HpC9aa	Apologize and let her know that you feel like a jerk for how you acted.  Let her know why you acted that way and how you know that it upset her.  Then tell her how you feel for her and how sorry you truly are.|`|M4L3QY3gaa	First of all, If you text her, verbatim, what you just typed, tomorrow at school is going to be one HI-LARIOUS time.

Do you really want this girl if she would cheat on a boyfriend of two years? She would likely do this to you. Walk away now. In fact, RUN. Not just away from her but you don't need to be dead too if he's for real, and unfortunately in this world this crap happens. Don't be Mr. Macho and try and save her. Look elsewhere for someone who deserves you. She obviously doesn't. Don't be a sucker.|`|736afc7cc6a4a8fd39900662c2379a91aa	number one. if he is cheating on himshe may cheat on you. May be not because it looks like she is looking for stability in a way. BTW it is somewhat funny she kept it from you for so long!! Why?    Numer 2. run like heck! This guy is a sick controller and may not care if he hurts you and get three hots and a cot the rest of his life!     number 3. Pray and ask God for the proper answers and He will give them to you....be careful.|`|Talzm1x7aa	you should get the cops involved if u want her to be safee|`|XKtjEiEraa	If she is really worried about breaking up with him because of physical retribution, this is something you need to bring to the authorities. She can't just stay with him forever because she's scared to leave him. By the way, going over there and beating him up is really just the best way to make things worse. Because honestly, how can you be there for her when you're in prison for assault?|`|4dtUsaYhaa	are you sure shes just not playing you ? if she didnt want to be with him, she should have told you from the start and gone to the cops if he was threatening her. what about her friends ?do they know about you adn the 2 yr bf ?|`|wYLWBufWaa	whatever you do don't get involved in this the only thing you can do is be there for her get her to call the police and report her boyfriend for threatening her tell her to change her phone number and cut all contact with him and hope you guys stay together you seem to really care for her good luck
XKtjEiEraa	I'm confused, did you leave out the part where he was busy defusing a bomb? He PUSHED you away? That's totally uncalled for and baffling in its own right, not to mention that you had been making out just moments before. No, you were not overreacting by feeling rejected, and it seems like there should be a reason for him acting like this.|`|ZtDiWBjmaa	NO! If he apologized you have to try to let it go, but I would be so upset!!|`|hd0mp4nKaa	As long as you both have apologized, I see no problems. Sure it is fine that you felt bad.|`|TCrymuaoaa	negative. you were not overreacting, guys are rude sometimes and yes they can be jerks like that...it gets me mad...like they only want to kiss you when they want to..and when you do the same thing that they done like two seconds after they call us names or say oooh i was just playing...you have a right to be upset... talk to him tell him whats wrong just dont sit there and act like nothing happen in time...things will get worse it you dont speak up now|`|fH0cZIy1aa	no way were you overreacting. I would've felt the same way. Thats horrible what he did, its just so rude and mean. You two weren't even arguing. You did the right thing by not letting him kiss you, make him feel how hurt and embarrassed you were. If he does it again then threaten to break up with him. This guy sounds like a real jerk.|`|YiGu9wdIaa	you weren't overreacting.that was natural.    but make-up with him soon.good luck with that. :)|`|50b446cc42d27523aeb81faf9e2a34aeaa	You have every right to be upset and feel hurt, that was uncalled for on what he did.  If he wanted to continue talking or simply did not want to start kissing again, he could of easily let you know verbally in a NICE way or sweetly hug you instead, something to easily let you know he wanted a small pause.  Not letting him kiss you was him getting a taste of his own medicine, but now that's over, be sure to talk things out about it.  Ask him why he did what he did, and try to find a resolution.  At the moment it was okay to be mad, but don't let it become something greater for no reason.  Just friendly advice :)|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Maybe he needed a longer break.|`|fijYOZg1aa	Sure you have that right.|`|1KajpBdaaa	heck no...|`|TGMUFytraa	What I have learned is that you have to pick your battles. If you get upset over every little thing, such as him not wanting to kiss you, you're just going to end up loosing him because you get mad over every little detail. You may have been hurt but talk to him, don't just get mad and act the way you do. What does it solve?? Him getting mad at you and causing a bigger fight?? Choose your battles.|`|YQjTSpXOaa	No you were not over reacting he really looked like a dumb fool to do that to you, asked him to be a gentleman instead of a bully.|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	Maybe he wanted to do something with you that doesn't involve playing with your tonsils......I mean yeah kissing great but maybe get to know him better and let him feel the urge rather than constantly trying to be clingy.|`|6PaCUSzSaa	Why WOULDNT he want to be kissed by his girl? Seriously, my girl is always welcome to kiss me and vice versa =D|`|UyULJUx1aa	No, I don't think you are. That was a really weird thing for him to do. Maybe you should be on the lookout for deeper issues here...|`|SGCLFbAHaa	no he needed that! now he knows how u felt|`|kG3AfXvsaa	I think he overreacted more than you. He doesn't need to PUSH, he could gently move you away from him and say he doesn't want to... or just not say anything at all. My ex bf was amazing and he would always come up behind me and grab my waist... I wasn't always in the mood, so I would gently walk away and hold his hands as I walked away. He could do something along those lines.. tell him not to be such an a**hole.
YvpG26Pmaa	I think that you are hotter than Katharine McPhee. I would say that he is telling you the truth.|`|r8owV9esaa	your totally cute.. and cuter than her|`|vQmb8XZPaa	yeah u do lol|`|C4c8jFvsaa	I actually do see a resemblance with a coupl of the pictures. You are pretty =]|`|aRUEXTTtaa	u look similar     but the most beautiful celebrity is summer glau|`|d1xvjDmCaa	hey sis ,,,,,,,,,,,    he is damn right    u rockkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk...|`|jUK4qp60aa	No, you don't look like her but that doesn't mean he wasn't telling the truth.    I am sure he meant you were the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in person/in the flesh or he could mean you are the prettiest girl he knows.
vFzhdHBqaa	maybe he doesnt want to get caught texting u bak.. maybe u should just turn around and talk to him lol|`|cwpMLsM6aa	maybe he doesn't feel like texting you. Did he text you before or has he never responded to your texts.
YPAHeUucaa	Some people are just ignorant and mean. There's no need to stress about it if they're not important in your life, anyway. I know this is the most common answer, but it's true: ignore them. Be friends with who you want and don't let them get to you.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Get over it, who cares about them|`|5ENPxwbsaa	you say that they won't tell you what's wrong if you ask.  Did you try?  Be concise and understanding, and ask.|`|AX3DQw3Paa	There's going to be people like that everywhere. Just try to get over it sweetie. *hugs* Of course, you could always confront them. (But that might make the problem worse.)
42400cbb1dde89befcb5d823f70a4385aa	There is nothing now you can do about the pictures, but if you really don't like them there is something you could do. You can always have them dress you up just like a girl again & take better pictures of you.        jk|`|yoDWhQnhaa	All right. Where were your parents at this time? The first thing you should have done was yell for them, but no use crying over that. Now you need to confront your parents and get then to call your sisters friends parents and get them in TROUBLE. Even if your sister was sleeping, couldn't she hear? After you deal with the girls, get that friend that saw you in the underwear and tell her what happened. If she is a good friend she will understand. Good Luck!|`|AX3DQw3Paa	oh.....wow........I am so, so, sorry. I have...no advice besides of telling the truth.
i3pn4jNcaa	if you two feel the same way for eachother & his current relationship isnt working out then i think you should let him know how you feel. im sure hell be relieved to hear you say it because if hes unsure if you like him or not. do what your heart tells you
r2gonS44aa	Jess,         You were totally right to cut it off.  I have been with a man now for 4 years that I can't cut it off with, it always comes back to us dating and being together.       Leave him for good.  He is not your boyfriend anymore, and he gave up that right when he cheated on you.  He also gave up all the rights to knowing details about your life.  So NO don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.      He sound controlling and possessive, you are better off just to cut and dry... leave him, don't tell him about another man, It will just make things worse|`|4szonXiRaa	I do understand perfectly what you are going through!  You have to cut off All ties with him for your own sanity and well-being!  Do not use another guy to Pay back your former love!  Do you think it is ok for you to drag another man into this, when  your ex has a potential to harm him (or you)?  If you want to date, go to places that you would not go with your ex.  Find a new place to go, (even if it is out of town)!  Start new friendships and kick the ex to the curb!    Someone once said:   CONTROLLING MEN NEED TO CONTROL THEMSELVES!!!  (I could not agree more!  Get into a good church where   there are good men waiting for the right woman to come along!  Take your time though!|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	I have been through this myself.    You are in an abusive relationship and I recommend that you get help and advice on the best way to keep yourself safe and keep yourself from completely going back to him (Yes, you are still in this relationship and he knows it...he's still got you by the heart).    Here is a website that gives you the signs and symptoms of being in an abusive relationship. Check it out and you'll see that your relationship lines up with an abusive relationship. If you click to go to the next page, you will find phone numbers you can call for information and advice. Best of luck to you.    http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/sign...|`|2hhGgKBZaa	You don't owe your ex anything hun. Let him do his thing, and you do your thing. If you want to talk to this new guy, you go ahead and do it.     It might be easier for you to move on if you dont have any contact with your ex (and also would help any potential relationships with new guys). You and your ex broke up for a reason (you know that already as you listed them!), so take this as a sign to go forward and move on with your life as an individual.     I just recently got out of a similar situation as yours (was engaged but he was too controlling etc, so broke it off), so i know how you feel. It will get better with time, and i do really recommend no contact with your ex. Lean on your friends for some support, they will help you though! Good luck my dear, you will feel better.|`|M79usPMkaa	You need to move on; Your ex is obviously a chump if he's threatening you, his former woman.  You should never go back to a guy like him, what the hell are you thinkin' lady?  I don't see what your malfunction is unless you have some self-esteem issues that you didn't state. There's no reason to be like this.|`|XKtjEiEraa	You broke up with this guy and you still feel the need to call him and ask permission to go on a date? This is past controlling on his part, darlin, this is obsessive. There is no need for you to call him. If Mr. Hyde was controlling, abusive, and cheated, no matter how great Dr. Jekyll was, I would do a 180 and run the other way and so should you. Move on with your life. Go with the last few sentences you wrote. Move on, let go of hope, and go on a date with the new guy.
XMH9RTRxaa	It was good that you were honest with him.  You let him know that he messed up last time, so now he possibly learned from his mistakes.  This guy seems to like you, I say give him one more chance.|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	long story    ur ex is mean:   http://www.beingmean.webs.com|`|wu2g3BtRaa	yes he really wants to see you and he probably still has feelings for you.  if you don't like him and don't want to see him, don't lead him on... it's cruel and will give him the wrong impression.|`|wE2etBzbaa	This is all wrong, I kinda regret reading all,  it doesn't make sense.    if you don't want to see him, why you bother?  you obviously want and pretend you aren't... if u don't want to see him, then say no and tell him the truth..  try harder means you are interested.    he maybe interested to.       hopefully that answered your question|`|e8SPmZULaa	the beautiful thing WASNT a diss.    you should have called him back even without caller ID and asked if it was him calling you- its phone ettiqute lol.  if you didnt want to see him then u shouldnt have added the   One more thing, youll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P    because it seems like flirting and that you WANT to see him and that this is a chase.  yeh he likes you and wants to see you OBVIOUSLY.  i dont think being honest is bad but maybe just try the date and see but if you SERIOUSLY dont want to see him then just say no! he will get the message.  x|`|SGCLFbAHaa	well very complicated but you should try to give him another chance and hang out with him. if this time it doesnt go well then give it a while like a coupple of weeks then if he wants to see u agaoin then this time try to hang out with a group of people and him.  If it is still weird then just try to avoid him|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Guys say funny things sometimes, I wouldn't take it personal.|`|AIftgLEGaa	first of all, i would take that first statement as a compliment... just not a very well thought out one. i does seem to have feelings for you and want to see you. and no, it was not bad for you to be honest with him. i do think that you shouldn't see him again if you don't like him though. otherwise, you're just stringing him along.|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	follow your guts u know him better. if u dont feel right forget him just dont see him.|`|j4hmUPJgaa	U know that saying 'you don't know what you are missing until it's gone' ? Sounds like your ex is missing you b/c you aren't convenient anymore. Meet up with him, see how he acts for the next few days. DO NOT LET HIM HAVE YOUR HOO HAH!!! GUARD YOUR HOO HAH!!!|`|X1V5Unaaaa	i think that he might want to try and persue you again if hes trying to see you so hard when your kinda blowin him off.. so hopefully everything works out,    good luck:)
A9aB6vVmaa	Doesn't T-Girls mean Transvestite Girls? A little something extra downstairs?|`|VkXv4RInaa	ITS A TRAP!    :(|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Sorry, but not really.|`|tH2BqCVDaa	yes she is.|`|db0df80b53e0d913b731410541d71d76aa	I'd definitely go out with that dish on my arm.    But let me preface that:  I'm 51 and married for the longest time.  What difference does it make that "she" has the same equipment as I do; neither of us would use it anyway!|`|4dtUsaYhaa	i think shes ugly. but thats because i dont like people of that nationality.|`|YwGNkLa6aa	she is not hot but she is good looking.
sAsEKPexaa	im not quite sure what you're asking but ill take a stab at it    well im kind of an old school romantic, but if you mean what would leave the most lasting impression on the guy here is what i would want if i was in this situation    th perfect date would start mid-day, noonish (valentines day is a saturday this year so no school El-Oh-El)    it would start with a walk, (it would be way better if you blindfold him) we would walk to the park where there would be a picnic prepared. now this wouldn't consist of normal picnic foods, but it would have Turkey sandwiches with just tomato and mayo, a ton of cheez-itz and several bottles of vitamin water Revive flavor. (Optional chocolate cream oreos El-Oh-El)    we would devour that and move n to the next part of the date which would consist of more walking to see an afternoon movie, (probably my bloody valentine)     after this movie it would be about four, that's when we would go to th mall and engage in the mini-golf. that would pass some time, and when night comes surprise him with tickets to a concert that night and you have had th perfect date...    ps-- these are the plans i have for my "girl" and i except i am the escort El-Oh-El but its just as awesome both ways.|`|sQq8q4Biaa	no idea, but im planing on suicide for valentine's day so what does it matter (classy and non original)|`|P3TwooCBaa	well...if I like her, it wouldnt matter as long as im with her|`|TkAJOe8caa	good
BwDyOv7waa	HAve a thing to serve as a gauge.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	just hint at it,   grab his shirt and be like,"kissing isn't gonna be good enough for valentines day, you better be ready"  or something like that  my and my bf are kinda having SX lol, we're both not big on the valentines day thing,   but last year he turned my  bedroom into something...  there were chocolates everywhere scattered on the foor the beds, everything there were candles, heart pillows, and then there was a cartier necklace it was so romanic
acWyJ3t0aa	You treat her with Love , dignity , and respect and let her know that seeing her sad saddens you . Tell her you feel so bad because there is really nothing that you can do , but that you are ready to do anything that will make her feel better , but only when she feels she is ready to talk . Give her some space , but stay close enough by that she knows she can always reach out to you and you will be there to help out .|`|nyylb6qUaa	Comfort her, let her know that your heart goes out to her. Let her know that anything she has to talk to you about is okay. Give her a hug, and maybe cry with her. May God Bless both of you.|`|MKHd10MYaa	Check up to see how she feels -- ONCE.    Let her open up to you if she wants to, otherwise leave her alone. She may not want to talk about it.|`|Px5ft9R1aa	talk to her about it  don't just leave her alone because on the inside shes probably dieing to tell someone about her feelings and what the person meant to her|`|6PaCUSzSaa	Well, to tell you, i wouldn't make any moves JUST yet right now she is a tad fragile and if you come in with your feelings for her then her life will get a bit complicated and her emotions will get confusing, just be there for her...and then when she is about over it tell her how you feel about her and ask her out for a fun little date|`|AA10548545	just ask her about who's dead. what she thinks about that person.that days when he spend time with them. this type of things people didn't get chance to share with some one in family, so u can do that role. with the help of that she can come out from this situation, don't ask to many question just make her more talkative.|`|hKHtp2gxaa	No don't leave her alone.  Obviously you care a lot about her.  You have to extend yourself at her time of need. :)  console her.
TkCAnjkwaa	When I was younger, I was an impulsive lad.I used to be quite aggressive and violent (from ages 9-16 ).Fights and quarrels were commonplace. I remember beating my friends, people I didnt like, people who I picked on....Now I am 21 and I am really ashamed of what I've done. I've come around a full circle since then, and I went as far as to seek out people who I'd hurt, and apologized in the most profound manner I could. I am proud to say that I have not hurt anybody in the last 4-5 years.I do get angry but I have learned to walk away and to not lose my temper.Trust me friend, Its not worth hurting another person or any other living being, even if it is a tree or a worm.|`|U8kDudnKaa	Nayhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!    (you can't see.....my fingers are crossed.....haa haa ha hee hee he)|`|0QXEpSs4aa	wen i was a kid, i use to beat my siblings wen they make any mistakes..

Its cowardice.    There is ntng like that u loose temper and tend to beat up someone.    Its weakness. The people around us allow you the tantrum and you think it right or something you can easily get away with. Its so only because of affection and relationship.?|`|PdpHe63Daa	beaten? no, lost my temper and knocked the hell out of them.. definatlety.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	no, i haven't beaten anyone.  i don't have an urge to go to jail!!!|`|rkZhVpvgaa	Lost temper 2/3 times on my children and beaten too, but not too harsh.|`|dFlc9DVsaa	please don't. try to overcome your anger so as not to hurt your siblings or friends.    i believe you're a good person by nature only you lose your control when you're really angry.|`|ffhVSzqpaa	no surely i won't beat ny1. bt ya i ll b frustrated wid dat person bcoz if i hav workd hard n dat material bt stll i won't b gettin result 4 d same so itz obvious 2 gt frustrated bt won't beat ny1..    at no case i ll beat ny1..even if he/she has done dat purposely..|`|JlHabNWhaa	i wont beat anyone but if i lose temper surely i'll scold anyone. most of the times i'll scold my mom(whatever the prob is). she ll understand my situation and ll calm me down.
acWyJ3t0aa	If she is a friend , then tell her what you think and that no matter what she has your support and friendship . If you offer advice , then offer her the kind of advice you would want in that situation . Always remember to contradict her whenever she says something negative about herself and tell her that other people don't think like that about her so why should she ? Be positive and supporting and truthful with her at all times , and let her know if you disagree with something , but tell her that agree or disagree you and she are friends and that's the truth !|`|yoDWhQnhaa	Tell her the truth that you thing she is amazing and to get her head back in the game and you will be cheering her the whole time|`|EZ6RCjAqaa	Tell her she needs to get her head up. Tell her all the stuff shes good at. Just be really supportive. And tell her how much people care about her. All the nice things she does. Tell her no one on this earth is perfect everyone has a problem or two in life.
50b446cc42d27523aeb81faf9e2a34aeaa	Trying to make them forget by persisting you haven't had sex or anything relating to it will make you seem more suspicious.  The best thing to do is to simply ignore it, you lied and these are consequences of it because school loves to live off of rumors.  Just remember for next time if you're placed in a situation like this, telling the truth is much less embarrassing and is more constructive.  Besides, you yourself know the truth and your friends do too.  If the guy you have a crush on decides to buy into the rumors then he's not worth your time|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Ignore them. You know it's not true.|`|1q5ZEMvraa	Why did you lie in the first place? You put yourself in the situation. Just forget about it, everyone else will. The school does not only revolve around you.
cj8iM1Olaa	Haha, well don't pull a me.    I cheated on my girlfriend on her prom night with her best friend. Left her at prom, went straight to the best friend's house...    Wow i was monster a couple years ago
cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	well if you ace your background check you've won half the battle!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Just be nice.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	yeah I saw that movie too|`|pqyLfCNVaa	unless you have nothing to hide, then its ok.    and they're ******* crazy|`|AIftgLEGaa	first of all, i hope they don't find anything on the background check. its just sounds like a case of very overprotective parents. ask your girlfriend if there is anything you should know about her parents before you meet them. if she says nothing, or gives bad advice, just be polite, and kind. act like yourself though, they may see through it if you are being fake.|`|CB30nM8Waa	Relax, all they want to do is make sure you're not on drugs, an alcoholic, been to prison or anything like that.     Just be polite (saying please, thank you, and give them both a handshake) and express to them that you only have your girlfriend's best interest in mind. They aren't doing it to "punish" you, they just don't want their daughter getting into a bad situation. Many parents constantly worry about that.    If you have nothing to hide, then don't worry about it.|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	haha u love her u do anything for her even if she have an overly protective parents the more u have to show u care and willing to protect her in anyway.|`|edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	lol, dude tell her parents to shuv it and move on. thats outrageous|`|sTqfKpbraa	well just let them do wateva they want    they are going serious so just go with the flow  answer everything honestly and have faith|`|vfj4kyGIaa	You need to act polite and don't be all over their daughter, also feel relaxed, once you are then you will be able to talk more eaily|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	lol and i thought my girl parents were crazy just make sure you care enough about this girl before you put yourself though all this stuff cause the sound of there parents you might be in for a bumpy ride but just be yourself|`|UwsbuHZYaa	I think that is a smart move on their part.  I have had girls ask me straight out for information to check my background out-Bravo their heads are in the right place.  How would it be if the girl had no problem dating a felon or a married man-would you still want to be with her?|`|JeYJmLRLaa	let them check, if you are worried about it then obivously you have done something wrong. i would get to where you could joke around with them, my dad did that to my current bf haha|`|KncPJwIaaa	run a background check on them give them a taste of what they should know what you know and will be funny cause you ain't killer or are you lol|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Take it easy, your rep will only increase with the background check going your way! So dont fret it... +1|`|hd0mp4nKaa	Just show up and say, look, i love your daughter. then runaway to Bora Bora together.|`|18kjvDVPaa	do everything they expect you to do and if you don't know ask your G-friend what they want from you and if that don't work get the hell out of there|`|5GKKHbgHaa	Well if you have nothing to fear than emphazise that to them. Be confident and express that you have nothing to fear but are uncomfortable with what they are doing. Do not tell them what to do...they won't like that but still give them your opinion.|`|O716Z3HRaa	OMG, that's a first. First you gotta win her over then you'll have her on your side work on the family. Since you're just starting to date I wouldn't worry about it until later on where your gf wants you to meet the family.|`|XKtjEiEraa	If you're under 18, what exactly do they expect to find? If you're over 18 (and I'm making the assumption that she is too), what exactly do they expect to accomplish? More importantly, is there anything in your background that you haven't told her about? If not, then don't worry about it. The fact is, you can only be yourself and put your best foot forward to a girl's parents, just like any other guy. If they do a background check, that's their business, but don't feel like that means you have to go out of your way to prove how great a boyfriend you are.|`|A4OM6nI9aa	wtf? that's a bit wrong....you should run a background check on them and see if THEY like that!|`|mzl4sOKoaa	Well if you don't have anything to hide, fine. Also they just want their little girl to be safe. Then again, that's pretty freaky.|`|kT4I3C6caa	Be yourself!  Dont try too hard!  Be calm and slow it down!  Be a good listener and ask questions, do not mouth too much!!    Good Luck and have fun!|`|AA12224397	If what you're looking is to impress them then give them means to know more and be overly honest. Tell them what they want to know so they don't have to dig around. Tell them, "Ask away..."|`|gRsuXxkbaa	if ur not a criminal or ex con I think u have an in|`|jbuIA3T0aa	They are just being protective of their daughter. If you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about. I  guess they just dont wanna see their daughter get hurt. It's still strange though. but if you like her enough then it doesnt really matter does it??|`|jUK4qp60aa	Okay, if you have a clean record then you already have a good start.     As for winning them over, as cliche as it sounds, just be yourself. If they do not like you the first time around, then maybe they will warm up to you eventually.|`|JlaOvOMoaa	Haha.  Obviously people are different - these parents might just feel strongly about protecting their daughter.  Who knows, you could be some terrorist or something! XD  It's not unheard of; the parents might have a lot of money or assets that they need to protect, if you guys end up getting married, they want to make sure you're not a scammer.  I'm sure you aren't however, but they may be suspicious haha  I agree with you - it IS weird  You need to tell your girlfriend that you would be happy to have a meal or something with them, and he can do the rest.  Remember, try to keep it casual.  On the day, be well presented.  Make sure you don't create a bad impression, e.g. bad breath  Be sure of yourself, but most of all, the most important thing is to be yourself.  Good luck! and i hope this helps|`|HDEbDPp3aa	if u really love her just express that.see they want her daughter to be in safe hands.                     if they called u they might be thinking u r good for her.|`|H6gjOGnGaa	Those parents are not acting normal, but I would guess there is a method to their madness.  You asked how you are supposed to win them over, and the answer is, you aren't.  They probably just don't want their little girl dating anyone right now.    Most men would be annoyed or offended upon being informed that a background check is being run on them.  If this girl is worth the drama, just continue to date her and put up with it.  If she's not, move on - such demanding parents will only continue to be demanding in the future, even if you do meet with their eventual approval.|`|6mcmeAe1aa	Careful! If you **** this up you could find yourself in an unmarked FBI SUV being taken to the middle of the desert for execution!
vgpuTBmSaa	you know what? she should just say, hey i need to teach you how i like to be kissed...that way it isn't saying he is doing it wrong, just that she prefers a different technique
i8Pl0Pejaa	I've been through exactly the same thing, and i know how it feels. I did break up with my ex for it, but then we got back together. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	it sounds like he does a lot of chasing. Have you tried to explain to him how your feeling? If that doesn't work you could always reverse roles on him, (flirt around) Can you live with a guy who is constantly flirting. He might have intentions to cheat, maybe you should give him a reason not too.... if you catch my drift. hehe. Good luck|`|uu1IUxAkaa	how does it feel to be one of the girls on his list?  do not feed his ego. find someone that puts u 1st not girl number  289533|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Nancy, it appears that you are the second or third gal in this relationship and are being lied to. The choice is yours.

PVHJ8jTuaa	wow your a total jerk    I would suggest neither|`|roGXVGFOaa	no offense, but the way u r describing both girls...it sounds like all u r focusing on is their looks. relationships don't work based on such things. yes, looks are important but it seems that's the only thing u r looking at.|`|TGMUFytraa	Wow, way too long. Got bored and gave up reading.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	typical guy, you don't deserve either|`|I0g24Jmkaa	looks aren't everything.|`|ux2YlhRaaa	Girls with colored eyes are hott if you get a blue or green eyed girl you are a lucky man.|`|ENXfwDVBaa	lol,jerry i say go for the nice and sweet one. :]|`|PUdrvmhBaa	The types of girls you should be after are the ones from that tv show with Blanche, Dorothy, Rose, and Sophia.|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	how bout you quit caring so much about which one gives you a better *****?|`|JB8samC7aa	too long, not read.|`|a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	i dont think you will get either,,   better luck next year, sorry!!|`|Ee4y7OJzaa	you need to relax man. its not all about the physical things in the relationship. even though that can be good. i know from experience lol. youre only 14, and u need to make FRIENDS with her, not just on looks. who ever u get along with most, pick her!!!!|`|WneD1JMRaa	Wow, what a situation! I think you should go for the girl that lives close to you. Just keep spending time more and more time with her and then make your move :) Forget about the long distance relationships, they never seem to work out.
5fdgfNCRaa	She is obviously already on the edge, and maybe it's because of this final project or because of something else. If she went crazy at you for giving her constructive criticism, which she did ask for in the first place by asking you to "look over" her paper, that's hypocritical. I don't take correction well, but I'm smart enough to not have my boyfriend look over my papers because it's bound to be bad if you mix in clear-cut right and wrong, as in rules of grammar and punctuation. She should've been more patient with you; if she didn't want criticism, she shouldn't have literally asked for it.    Like I said, she probably has that project and many other things on her mind. I'm willing to bet she's been close to breaking for a while now.    Don't worry about it; it was just an argument, not a physical fight. I'm glad she trusts you to not hit her (I'm sure she's aware of what you're capable of doing), but she's just pushing you by yelling and hitting you - especially over next to nothing!    My word to her is to calm down. It's just a project. She should be happy that you're not the type to get physical in a fight... I'm sure she's never been in that kind of situation (based on her audacity) and I know she wouldn't want to be|`|SNaxiArHaa	I think you had good reason for what you did. There is only so much abuse someone can take even if they can handle it. What you should do is tell her that you two need some time apart because of the way she acts. All you were trying to do was help her and she went crazy. You have no reason to feel bad and you are not a bad boyfriend because if i were a guy I would have left her all ready.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	YOu were right and she was wrong and it's totally her fault and she should stop being a pansy, youa ren't going to hurt her and she can't expect you to do her whole paper for her, she asked for your help and she needs to expect that you are going to help her by critisizing her work, if she can't get over that fact then she should not have asked for your help in the first place.|`|sqNsOIzkaa	Awwww you sound like a sweetheart. Well sometimes you need to blow some steam too. I dunno she seems to take criticism not very well and you're very patient. Its alright she might use this against you next time but lol you guys will be fine.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	she needs to get over it. if she didn't want honest help she shouldn't have asked for it.  but you should have said look, do you want my help or not?  your paper isn't perfect and if my corrections wont help, then take it to your mom or dad|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Wow, what a mess.    To begin with, your reaction was uncalled for.  Yes, you were frustrated with the situation, but that was hardly an appropriate or even related response.    I don't think you have a lot of respect for her.  Obviously you think there is something wrong with her (that's what you told her), but you also just wrote a forum of strangers about how much smarter you are than she is.  Classy.    You kids have anger problems.  If she hits you, and if you have moments where you're "completely psychotic," maybe you shouldn't be together.    This sounds like a pretty dysfunctional relationship.  This argument made you suicidal?  Wow.|`|E0yIdPytaa	if she's not mature enough to handle being yelled at, she shouldn't be yelling.  it wasn't the nicest thing you could've yelled -should have gone for the "you make me fell bad about myself" guilt card- but she's a big girl.  she should be able to handle it|`|iAhCtXFIaa	she way over reacted, everyone has their boiling pointtt, ppl do have their moments, and it was just your moment to let it out. just give her time im sure she'll get over it.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	you got yourself a baby,poor you|`|08f801cb12076679501327c507f16f44aa	You still made the choice to yell, when you could have chose to remain calm. Yelling is a bad choice, Just like hitting is a bad choice.  You will ALWAYS find, nothing good comes from either.    Say it out loud. NOTHING GOOD COMES FROM YELLING OR HITTING!!!    Also, something I learned about women years ago, sometimes they just want you to listen. They aren't always interested in us guys solving their problems.|`|6627NijZaa	well i never put 2 spaces after a period in my essay and my teachers ok with it and i think you shouldnt have yelled that much to her girls feeling are easily broken by the person they luv most|`|MSJEyhSJaa	I Don't think you did anything horrible. You were trying to help, and some people just can't take criticism.  Lately I find guys are often so worried that they're abusive towards thier girlfriends because of all the womens rights stuff going on and the constant abuse allegations.  While I'm totally against abuse, of course, I think sometimes girls take it to far. They are told that they don't have to take crap from thier men, so they don't. But in all this men are losing almost any right to fight back in a relationship. No-ones perfect, everyone gets mad and yells. Girls and guys! you can't expect guys to sit and listen to criticism and not defend themselves! You didn't hit her, and it sounds like you never would. She can't expect you to remain calm while she insults and hits you and does as she pleases.  I'm not saying you should be agressive, but I think guys need rights as much as women do. She might not mean it, but it's a bit manipulative of her to say she's afraid of you unless you really were AWFUL to her about this.|`|AA11789493	Wow, you guys have issues.  First, she should never hit anyone.  Technically, it assault.  I guess it's a matter of experience as to how we handle things, sometimes not showing the other person proper respect.  Basically, she pushed your buttons.  You are proud of your ability in English, she asked for help, you helped her, and the help you gave her was disregarded.  You got an attitude, and I don't blame you, but sometimes we should just shut up and walk away and maybe make a little comment like I did my best to help but it wasn't good enough so don't ask me for help again because this type of thing is too frustrating for me and I can't handle it.  Go for a walk and resolve to never fall into this trap again.  As the saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished.  You sound like a good guy, so stay that way but don't let your frustration take over.  Tell her that she better not beat you up again because you won't take it any more and mean it.|`|YdD200a6aa	Have you ever talked about any of these problems you've had with her in the past?    Communication is key in relationships... you need to talk to each other about EVERYTHING, good or bad, between the two of you, to prevent situations such as these.    Anyway, onto my answer:  I can't say you were or were not just in yelling at your girlfriend, but it definitely was rude on her part to yell first. She asked for your help, and you gave it to her... what more could she ask for? She should be the one apologizing for not accepting your help when she asked for it.|`|5af20e99565586ed67070be1aaa5fbb9aa	wow.. novel...|`|TXnSKiGIaa	Oh poor guy. I feel bad fir guys cuz they have to deal with us girls. Anyhoo, she was probably just really stressed from her paper and stuff, yknow? I don't think you were wrong to yell, I mean wasn't the best thing, but hey we all lose our cool once in a while. Well what I'd suggest you do is give her room to cool off and when she's ready, talk and if you want to, talk things over about how you're sorry and don't forget to mention that she needs to fix things too! Just remember girls are very moody haha  Goodluck!!!|`|59GGw0WAaa	Ok I got to babe, to me it looks alright. That was a big mistake because you should know you never criticize your woman unless you are prepared to open the biggest can of bull $ it you have ever opened. Oh by the way it's not over for she will bring it up later. So stop your crying for you know better, you knew she was not going to take it well. That's funny, you played football and wrestled and still you got chumped up by a crying brat that couldn't take a little advice. Can you imagine if you buy a car together?
sknTCvnzaa	OK, everyone get those down thumbs ready!  :)    You are 17 years old and pregnant.  The last thing that would be good for you (and your baby)  is to dash off and get married just because your boyfriend is leaving for the army.    Take some time to make wise decisions.  Your decisions from here on out involve a child and you do not need to be rushing into marriage at 17.    Get your schooling, get your thoughts together, mature as a responsible woman and mother, and then think about marriage.  Please don't do it now.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	call your local courthouse marriage license department and ask them.  It's differs in some states.|`|vzZE0ktYaa	It depends on where you live.|`|4CTpBOdcaa	i live in tn and my husband and i decided to get married asap well we got the marriage license and the counseling and all together we were married about 2 weeks later
kkW3aQf7aa	I am 17 and i feel like the same thing is happening to me. The fact that you're a teenager now and wan't more freedom is a big factor. You don't need your mom constantly around anymore but she may not deal with that very well, it's hard on parent's to let go. I argue with my mom alot because i feel like she treats me like a kid. Sometimes i am so mean to her i could feel bad for days as opposed to when i was younger and we were really close. Of course as you grow older you will start to understand her more and most likely your relationship will get fixed. My sister was enemies with my mother and as soon as she moved out they became the bestest friends. At a certain age living together just does not work anymore. give yourself a couple of years and take the tme to sit down with your mother and explain how you feel.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	you need to receive Jesus... He will give you His own nature in your heart... our human nature is evil, selfish... but Gods nature is loving and kind... i hated my mother for many years ... it took God to heal my heart and bring reconciliation ... you can email me at numbre1@yahoo.com|`|HVG32PWuaa	hormones.  all teenagers go through it  we get mad for no reason and yell and cuss  and in the end we feel so bad and stupid
OEn9rPgWaa	My guess would be that he likes you lots and is just eager to have you around and show you to his friends.  I assume he talks about you to them and wants them to see you are real and not just in his imagination|`|h9s3l7CGaa	He might have emphysema|`|TJntzGB2aa	hello he really likes you
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Alejandra, I think the best thing for you would be to strive to make new friends outside of your  family. There is lots of love out there, you just need to put yourself out there and do your best to keep a positive attitude about life. Your going to have to learn how to trust honey, its not easy, but its well worth the effort. Have you ever considered doing volunteer work? That's a great way to meet new people.
cj8iM1Olaa	Yep, i love brace faces|`|nDQOwAA3aa	yes braces are hot|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Yes, I think braces on some girls is very sexy.
