0KmJwYunaa	There's basically two ways, either electrochemically as in a fuel cell which is essentially a battery except with hydrogen and oxygen as the chemicals involved or as a thermodynamic mechanical engine driving a generator.   <br>  <br>  The fuel cell is probably the one that you would want to demonstrate in a science fair and there are educational kits to make them.   Wikipedia can help.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe hydrogen to be a terrible alternative fuel, not only is the energy density low (405 Wh/l for compressed H2, 2600 Wh/l for liquid H2 while gasoline has 9000 Wh/l) but the environmental costs of replacing or modifying existing vehicles plus establishing a distribution network would have an enormous carbon footprint.   <br>  <br>  Even Sandia Labs while developing the CR5 as a more efficient way of producing hydrogen concluded that it would be better to continue the process and synthesize fuels such as methanol,  synthetic gasoline and or diesel for use with existing vehicles and infrastructure.|`|hf27zNgdaa	Hydrogen is cool.  But we have to build Nuke Plants and dam several rivers.  But I say lets go for it!|`|tHvwdev4aa	Put it in a compressed chamber with oxygen. The small explosion will cause the piston to move. Use the piston to turn a coil of wire around a magnet there by generating electricity. The same way as with any other fuel. Its a simple generator.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen is the most stupidest way of getting electricity I ever heard of. Its damaging to the environment and very inefficient. Normally the only advantage is Hydrogen is lighter then conventional batteries. But you are not even using it as a battery. Containing hydrogen is near impossible as hydrogen particles are very small and hydrogen is extremely explosive making it extremely dangerous. Hydrogen rises very fast up into the atmosphere to then react with ozone.<br>  <br>  The whole Hydrogen thing was a ploy by the Oil and car companies to take focus off actual viable forms of storage and propulsion. Flywheel technology and capacitor technology looks to be viable batteries or in the case of the Flywheel it doesn't need to be converted to electricity at all (the controller is complicated for this). Flywheel has the potential to be very good as you can keep the energy as kinetic this means high efficiency. The flywheel is in a vacum so there is next to no loss in energy.<br>  <br>  Your car isn't really run off water its off electricity. You would do better just running it off electricity. If you want to do something exciting and even more on the cutting edge of science use the flywheel. A cheap way of making a fairly safe flywheel is to make it out of wood. For safety don't charge it too much and remember the forces on the fly wheel are great. Alternatively you can use any spinning object like a second wheel. You could charge it by using a motor or by pedal power and then just have a system for it engaging the wheel of the vehicle.<br>  Creating a vacum may be beyond you and is not necessary to show the principle of flywheels.<br>  <br>  So what I am saying is your not even using hydrogen to store energy so its really inefficient compared to just using the electricity straight. The only way of getting the electron off the atom that I can see is by combustion. It requires 1312 KJ energy to remove the electron. So if you don't use a reaction then you just have used up a whole lot of energy with no forward motion.  Hydrogen reacting with oxygen goes to water. The only usefulness of hydrogen is for storing energy. A car cannot run off water. Its running off the electricity. The electricity converts water into its parts and then the parts react and form back to water you can use the kinetic energy to convert back to electricity but you will have a lot less energy then you started with.|`|fpUx07Dzaa	More or less. The H2 gets oxidized (loses an electron). This electron is sent over to oxygen, which gets reduced. The electron travels through a wire to get to the oxygen, which is the definition of electric current--electrons moving through a wire. <br>  <br>  Realize, though, you cannot actually "run a car on water" since the energy required to split the water is much greater than the energy you get back in the fuel cell.

If you examine the referenced plot you will see that the temperature *always* rises first and then the CO2 concentration rises. The temperature *always* falls first and then the CO2 concentration falls. The temperature and CO2 concentration are both obtained from chemical data at the same point in the Vostok ice cores, so they both come from the *exact* same time, so their temporal correlation is as close to exact as possible. This means that atmospheric CO2 concentration is controlled by temperature and *not* vice versa. Stated another way, changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration have *never* affected global temperatures in 400,000 years of historical scientific data<br>  <br>  Further, the temperature record of the last 100 years, <a href="http://www.co2science.org/scripts/Template/0_CO2ScienceB2C/images/subject/other/figures/mannetal_nh1000.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.co2science.org/scripts/Templa...</a> , indicates rather pointedly that there is an approximate 0.2C degree standard deviation in the measurements. Couple that with the Oak Ridge studies of the temperature dependence of CO2 solubility in sea water, <a href="http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/handbook.html" rel="nofollow">http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/handboo...</a> , and the result is a root-mean-square error in atmospheric CO2 emission from the oceans of 30 billion metric tons -- this error is greater than the total CO2 emission from mans use of fossil fuels in one year.<br>  <br>  Therefore, since the oceans can emit more CO2 in response to a 0.2C degree fluctuation in temperature than man can produce in a year, it is categorically impossible for us to control CO2 emission.|`|7a1a4586cbdfad0a780847164818434aaa	Sure.

Recycle means using it till it can't be used anymore   and then try to resell it  and if that does not work  at that point give it to a place that will melt it down and make new product using the same materials.|`|8cCgXQIoaa	No one HAS to spend money to be green - in fact most of the things you can do to be greener involve reducing your energy,water, material intake, and also re-using things - so that means that you are paying for less because you're using less.  -Turning the water off when you're washing or shaving in the shower, when you're brushing your teeth, or scrubbing dishes in the sink.(you're not going to need the water for any of that.) And you could collect the cold water that's usually wasted while you wait for it to heat up and use it for something else.(e.g. rinsing off dishes, watering plants, use it as mop water, use it in a spray bottle to mist yourself when you're hot, etc.) Also you can collect rain water in large buckets.  Make it a habit to use the cold water handle on the faucet instead of the hot water one. (You'll be saving energy by not having to heat up the water which most of the time you don't need warmed up.)  - Flush less. Putting a filled water bottle in the water tank of your toilet also saves 1/2 gallon of water each flush.  - Get CFLs (compact fluorescent light bulbs.) Don't turn on lights unless you absolutely need them.  - Use a ceiling fan instead of an air conditioner. Don't turn your heater on first thing when it starts to get a bit cold, just put on some more clothing or a blanket to warm yourself up. Hand wash your dishes instead of using a dish washer.  Switch to cold water when washing your laundry and only wash full loads. Try to air dry your clothes on a line instead of using the dryer.   - Towel or air dry your hair instead of using a blow dryer and try to find other ways to style you hair other then using ironers.  - Buy cloth napkins and hankerchiefs.(though you might want to keep a few paper napkins around for messes that you'd rather not clean out) It may seem like you're spending a lot but in the long run you'll save money because you won't be buying and buying more napkins, and they usually don't waste anymore water to clean cause most of the time you can wash them with other loads.   - Stop buying trash liners, though you might need some for your large garbage can outside. Think about it you're just buying a plastic non-bio-degradable bag to put trash into it, when you already have a can that is supposed to be used for that. Just wash out the can (with rainwater or the cold shower water) whenever you need to.  -Don't buy bottled water. Get a filterer and use a stainless steel water bottle(plastic ones release chemicals into your water that are harmful to you.)  Obviously, bike or walk anywhere possible instead of driving. Try to carpool or take a bus to work instead of driving by yourself.  Re-use old clothing as rags.    Buy things in bulk.  Unplug things when they're not in use. (Things with settings for time,etc you might want to leave plugged in)|`|gDFC4xm8aa	Energy conservation is an easy and cheap way to help out the environment.

Reduce is the 1st of the 3 R's. And they can both be applied to everything. Conserving electriciy can save you money. There are a few items that you can buy to help conserve energy but you will break even pretty quickly. I use power stips with switches to reduce standby energy for most of my electonics. I have a programmable thermostat so I can save money on heating and cooling. I reduce food waste by planning a menu and shopping with a list, that way I don't have uneaten things rotting in the fridge. I reduce my meat consumption, conventionally farmed beef, pork and chicken are not good for the planet. I use a safe fish list to avoid eating endandgered or over fished seafood. I reduce the pesticides used to grow my food by purchasing organics when possible, I shop for most of my food at a local farmers market and am growing my own. Both save money. I reduce the amount of toxins in my cleaning and beauty products. I use vinegar, natural liquid soap and baking soda for almost all cleaning jobs. I do use eco friendly laundry soap and dishwasher soap. I line dry clothes and use vinegar as a fabric softener.    I got most of my ideas from "The Green Book", I've read quite a few books, but this is my favorite. I have also reduced consumerism. I don't go out shopping for the sake of shopping. If think I need clothes, I check my closet to see what I need, I tend to buy less trendy items so they don't go out of style quickly. I have a color scheme so all my clother coordinate. There are also clothing swaps popping up all over the nation. I don't buy anything unless I have tried it on and looked in the mirror.|`|3SAIIliLaa	You can really save money buying organic concentrated cleaners.

Fresh water otters tend to have sharper teeth for slicing through the flesh of fish - but they wouldn't say no to a fresh water mussel.|`|1eed603450abf040856fc1d69ead3586aa	Almost certainly Otters.  There is only one otter in the UK - they aquire the name "sea" when they use salt water.
